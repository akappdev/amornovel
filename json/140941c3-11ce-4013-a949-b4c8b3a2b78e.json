A moment later, she remembered, and an intense sadness pressed down upon her. Lying on her back, she stared up at the dark ceiling as the realization hit her yet again. The Lighthouse, the restaurant she and Seth had poured their lives into, was gone. Gone. It had burned to the ground a week ago, in a blazing fire that lit up the night sky for miles around Cedar Cove. A fire started by an unidentified arsonist.</p><p>Without bothering to look, Justine knew her husband wasn\u2019t in bed with her. Only a week had passed since the fire, but it felt like a month, a year, a lifetime. She didn\u2019t think Seth had slept more than three or four hours at a stretch since that shocking phone call.</p><p>Folding back the sheet, she climbed slowly out of bed. It was barely four, according to the digital readout on the clock radio. Moonlight filtered through a gap in the curtains, creating patterns on the bedroom walls. Justine slipped her arms into the sleeves of her robe and went in search of her husband.</p> <p>As she\u2019d suspected, she found him in the living room, pacing. He moved ceaselessly, his angry strides taking him from the fireplace to the window and back. When he saw her, he continued to walk, looking away as though he couldn\u2019t face her. She could tell he didn\u2019t want her near him. She barely recognized this man her husband had become since news of the fire.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you sleep?\u201d she asked, whispering for fear of waking their four-year-old son. Leif was a light sleeper and although he was too young to understand what had happened, the child intuitively knew his parents were upset.</p><p>\u201cI want to find out who did this and why.\u201d Fists clenched, Seth turned on her as if she should be able to tell him.</p><p>Tucking her long, straight hair behind her ears, Justine sank into the rocker in which she\u2019d once nursed their son. \u201cI do, too,\u201d she told him. She\u2019d never seen Seth this restless. Her strikingly blond husband was of Norwegian extraction, a big man, nearly six-six, with broad shoulders to match. He\u2019d been a commercial fisherman until soon after their marriage. That was when they\u2019d decided to open the restaurant. The Lighthouse had been Seth\u2019s dream, and with financial assistance from his parents, he\u2019d invested everything\u2014his skill, his emotions, their finances\u2014in this venture. Justine had been at his side every step of the way.</p><p>In the beginning, while Leif was an infant, she\u2019d kept the books and handled the payroll. When their son grew old enough for preschool, she\u2019d assumed a more active role, working as hostess and filling in where needed.</p> <p>\u201cWho would do this?\u201d he demanded again.</p><p>The answer eluded her just as it did him. Why anyone would want to hurt them was beyond her comprehension. They had no enemies that she knew of and no serious rivals. It was hard to believe they\u2019d been the target of a random firebug, but maybe that was the case. So far, there\u2019d been little real progress in tracking down the arsonist.</p><p>\u201cSeth,\u201d she whispered gently, stretching her hand toward him. \u201cYou can\u2019t go on like this.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond, and Justine realized he hadn\u2019t heard her. She longed to ease his mind, to reassure him. Her fear was that the fire had destroyed more than the restaurant. It had stolen Seth\u2019s peace of mind, his purpose and, in some ways, his innocence. He\u2019d lost faith in the goodness of others and confidence in his own abilities.</p><p>Justine\u2019s innocence had been devastated one bright summer afternoon in 1986, when her twin brother, Jordan, had drowned. Justine had held his lifeless body in her arms until the paramedics arrived. She\u2019d been in shock, unable to grasp that her brother, her twin, was gone. He\u2019d broken his neck after a careless dive off a floating dock.</p><p>Her entire world had forever changed that day. Her parents divorced shortly afterward and her father had quickly remarried. To all outward appearances, Justine had adjusted to the upheaval in her life. She\u2019d graduated from high school, finished college and found employment at First National Bank, then risen to branch manager. Although she\u2019d had no intention of ever marrying, she\u2019d been dating Warren Saget, a local builder who was the same age as her mother. Then she\u2019d met Seth Gunderson at their ten-year high-school reunion.</p> <p>Seth had been her brother\u2019s best friend. She\u2019d always felt that if Seth had been with Jordan that day, her brother might still be alive, and her own life would\u2019ve been different\u2014although she wasn\u2019t sure exactly how. It was ridiculous to entertain such thoughts; she recognized that on a conscious level. And yet...it was what she believed.</p><p>All through high school she\u2019d barely spoken to Seth. He was the football hero, the class jock. She was the class brain. And never the twain had met until that night nearly six years ago, when she\u2019d run into him at the reunion planning meeting. Seth had casually mentioned that he\u2019d had a crush on her during their high-school days. The look in his eyes told her he\u2019d found her beautiful then and even more so now.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t experienced an easy courtship. Warren Saget hadn\u2019t wanted to lose her and made a concerted effort to pressure her into marrying him. He\u2019d instinctively understood that Seth was a major threat. Warren bought Justine the largest diamond she\u2019d ever seen, promising a life of luxury and social prominence if she agreed to be his wife.</p><p>All Seth had to offer Justine was a twenty-year-old live-aboard sailboat\u2014and his love. By that time, she was so head-over-heels crazy about him that she could scarcely breathe. Still, she struggled, unwilling to listen to her own heart. Then, one day, she couldn\u2019t resist him anymore....</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m calling the fire marshal this morning,\u201d Seth muttered, breaking into her thoughts. \u201cI want answers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth,\u201d she tried again. \u201cHoney, why\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t honey me,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>Justine flinched at the rage in his voice.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a full week. They should have some information by now, only they\u2019re not telling us. There\u2019s something they don\u2019t want me to know and I\u2019m going to find out what. If I have to bring Roy McAfee in, I will!\u201d He looked directly at her then, probably for the first time since she\u2019d entered the room.</p><p>\u201cSeth, I like and trust Roy,\u201d she said, referring to the town\u2019s only private investigator, \u201cbut the fire department\u2019s already investigating. So is the insurance company. Let them do their jobs,\u201d Justine said in a soft voice. \u201cLet the sheriff do his.\u201d</p><p>Splaying his fingers though his hair, he released a slow breath. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t mean to take my frustration out on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Justine got up and walked into his arms, pressing her body against his, urging him to relax. \u201cCome back to bed and try to sleep,\u201d she said.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t. Every time I close my eyes, all I can see is The Lighthouse going up in smoke.\u201d</p><p>Seth had arrived a few minutes after the fire trucks and stood by helplessly as the restaurant, engulfed in flames, had quickly become a lost cause.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe it was Anson Butler,\u201d Justine said, thinking out loud. She\u2019d liked the boy and had trusted him\u2014which, according to her friends and neighbors, had been a mistake.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to believe it\u2019s him,\u201d her husband returned, the anger back in the clipped harshness of his words.</p><p>That was true. Seth had hired Anson several months earlier. The teenager was paying off court expenses because of a fire he\u2019d set in the city park. He\u2019d had no explanation for why he\u2019d burned down the toolshed. All Justine really knew were the few details Seth had divulged at the time he\u2019d taken the boy on.</p><p>To his credit, Anson had turned himself in to the authorities and accepted full responsibility for his actions. That had impressed her husband, and on the recommendation of their accountant and friend, Zachary Cox, who\u2019d become something of a mentor to the boy, Seth had agreed to give Anson a job.</p><p>At first the teenager had made an effort to prove his worth. He\u2019d shown up early for his shifts and put in extra hours, eager to please his employer. Then within a few weeks, everything had fallen apart. Tony, another dishwasher, had taken a dislike to Anson and the two had exchanged words. From what she understood, they\u2019d also gotten into a shoving match once or twice. As a result of their animosity, the tension in the kitchen had increased. Seth had talked it over with Justine and she\u2019d suggested they separate the two boys. Seth decided to make Anson a prep cook. Tony didn\u2019t like the idea of Anson getting a promotion, while he\u2019d been on staff longer and remained a dishwasher.</p><p>Then money had gone missing from the office and, although others had access to the money box, both Tony and Anson had been seen entering the room. When questioned, Anson claimed he\u2019d been looking for Seth because a supplier had a problem. Tony insisted he needed to talk to Seth about his schedule. Both boys were suspects, so Seth felt he had no choice but to lay them both off. The money was never recovered. Seth blamed himself because he\u2019d left the safe open, lockbox inside, while he was briefly out of the office.</p><p>A week later, The Lighthouse had burned to the ground.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have any proof it was Anson,\u201d Justine reminded her husband.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get proof. Whether he\u2019s the culprit or somebody else is. We\u2019ll find whoever did this.\u201d Seth\u2019s hard mouth was set with determination and his body tensed.</p><p>\u201cTry to sleep,\u201d she urged again. Despite his reluctance, she led him back to their bedroom.</p><p>Together they slipped under the sheets and she moved her body close to his. Seth lay on his back, eyes open, as she slid her leg over his and draped her arm across his powerful chest. He held her tight, as if she were the only solid thing left in a world that had started to crumble. Kissing his neck, Justine purred in his ear, hoping that if they made love, the restlessness in him would ease and he\u2019d be able to relax. But Seth shook his head, rejecting her subtle offer. She swallowed down the hurt and tried not to take it personally. All of this would be over soon, she told herself; soon everything would be back to normal. Justine had to believe it. Without that hope, despair would encroach, which was something she had to avoid at any cost. She fought to maintain a positive outlook, for her husband\u2019s sake and for the sake of her marriage.</p><p>When Justine woke again, it was morning and Leif was climbing onto her bed, wanting breakfast. Penny, their cocker spaniel-poodle mix, followed him, eyeing the bed.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Daddy?\u201d she asked, sitting upright, rubbing her hand tiredly over her face.</p><p>Her son dragged his teddy bear onto the bed, blue eyes soulful. \u201cIn his office.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t a good sign.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time we got you ready for school,\u201d Justine said briskly, glancing at the clock. Quarter to eight already. Leif\u2019s preschool class was held every morning, and even though their own schedules had fallen apart, Justine and Seth had done their best to keep Leif\u2019s timetable consistent.</p><p>\u201cDaddy\u2019s mad again,\u201d the four-year-old whispered.</p><p>Justine sighed. This was almost a daily occurrence, and she worried about the effect of so much tension on their son, who couldn\u2019t possibly understand why Daddy was mad or Mommy sometimes cried. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid he growl at you?\u201d Justine asked, then roared like a grizzly bear, shaping her hands into make-believe claws. With Penny barking cheerfully, she crawled across the mattress after her son, distracting him from worries about his father.</p><p>Leif shrieked and scrambled off the bed, racing for his bedroom. Justine followed and laughingly cornered the boy. Leif\u2019s eyes flashed with delight as she set out his clothes. He insisted on getting dressed on his own these days, so she let him.</p><p>After saying a perfunctory goodbye to her husband, Justine delivered Leif to preschool. When she pulled back into the driveway, Seth came out the door to greet her. The April sky was overcast, and rain was imminent. The weather was a perfect reflection of their mood, Justine thought. A sunny day would\u2019ve seemed incongruous when they both felt so fearful and angry.</p><p>\u201cI talked to the fire marshal,\u201d her husband announced as she got out of her car.</p> <p>\u201cDid he have any news?\u201d</p><p>Seth\u2019s frown darkened. \u201cNothing he was willing to tell me. The insurance adjuster\u2019s taking his own sweet time, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth, these things require patience.\u201d She needed answers as much as he did, but she certainly didn\u2019t want the fire marshal to rush the investigation.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you start on me,\u201d he flared. \u201cWe\u2019re losing ground every day. How are we supposed to live without the restaurant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe insurance\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know about the insurance money,\u201d he said, cutting her off. \u201cBut we won\u2019t get anything for at least a month. And it isn\u2019t going to keep our employees from seeking other jobs. It isn\u2019t going to pay back my parents\u2019 investment. They put their trust in me.\u201d</p><p>Seth\u2019s parents had invested a significant amount of the start-up money; Seth and Justine paid them monthly and she knew Mr. and Mrs. Gunderson relied on that income.</p><p>Justine didn\u2019t have any solutions for him. She recognized that he was distressed about more than the financial implications of the fire, but she had no quick or ready answers. \u201cWhat would you like me to do?\u201d she asked. \u201cTell me and I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>He glared at her in a way she\u2019d never seen before. \u201cWhat I\u2019d like,\u201d he muttered, \u201cis for you to stop acting as if this is a temporary inconvenience. The Lighthouse is gone. We\u2019ve lost everything, and you\u2019re acting like it\u2019s no big deal.\u201d Justine recoiled at the unfairness of his words. He made it sound as if she was some kind of Pollyanna who wasn\u2019t fully aware of their situation. \u201cDon\u2019t you realize the last five years are in ashes?\u201d he railed. \u201cFive years of working sixteen-hour days and for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we haven\u2019t lost everything,\u201d she countered, hoping to inject some reason into his tirade. She didn\u2019t mean to be argumentative; she simply wanted him to see that although this was a dreadful time, they still had each other. They had their child and their house. Together they\u2019d find the strength to start over\u2014if only Seth could let go of this anger.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing it again.\u201d He shook his head in barely controlled frustration.</p> <p>\u201cYou want me to be as angry as you are,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d he shouted. \u201cYou should be angry. You should want answers just like I do. You should\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than anything,\u201d she cried, her own control snapping, \u201cI want my husband back. I\u2019m as sick as you are about everything that\u2019s happened. We\u2019ve lost our business, and to me that\u2019s horrible, it\u2019s tragic, but it isn\u2019t the end of my world.\u201d</p><p>Her husband stared at her, incredulous. \u201cHow can you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re trying to lose your wife and son, too,\u201d she yelled, and before she could change her mind, she slipped back inside the car, slamming the door. Seth didn\u2019t try to stop her and that was fine with Justine. She needed to get away from him, too.</p><p>Without waiting for his reaction, she backed out of the driveway.</p><p>With no real destination, Justine drove into town, a few blocks from where Leif attended preschool classes. Her son would be in school for another two hours, and she had nothing urgent to do, no one to see, so she walked down to the marina.</p><p>Struggling to find meaning in the disaster that was battering her marriage, she sat down on a wooden bench in WaterfrontPark and gazed out at the cove. The sky was even darker now, and the water crashed against the rocks near the shore. She needed to think. Everything would be all right when she got home, she told herself. Seth would be sorry for what he\u2019d said, and she\u2014</p> <p>\u201cJustine, is that you?\u201d</p><p>She glanced up to see Warren Saget coming toward her. She offered him a weak smile. She didn\u2019t welcome his company\u2014didn\u2019t want to see anyone right now, but especially Warren, who\u2019d let it be known that he still had feelings for her. When she\u2019d declined his proposal, he hadn\u2019t taken it with good grace, and she tended to avoid him.</p><p>Without waiting for an invitation, he sat down beside her. \u201cI was sorry to read about the fire.\u201d</p><p>The Cedar Cove Chronicle had published a front-page spread about the arson, and everyone in town had been talking about it all week.</p><p>\u201cIt was...a shock,\u201d she mumbled, suddenly cold.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to rebuild, of course?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. She couldn\u2019t imagine Seth not wanting to rebuild. Within a few months, all of this would be behind them, she told herself again. Everything would be all right. There was simply no other option.</p><p>A chill raced up and down her arms as she remembered that this was exactly what she\u2019d believed the day they\u2019d buried Jordan. It was over, she\u2019d thought then. All the relatives would go home and school would start and everything would go on the same as before. Only it hadn\u2019t. How naive she\u2019d been, a thirteen-year-old girl who\u2019d trusted her parents to maintain the steady course of her life. They hadn\u2019t; they couldn\u2019t. Their own suffering had made them unable to cope with hers, destroying their marriage and tearing their family apart. Far from being over, the grief had barely begun.</p><p>\u201cWarren,\u201d she said, panic rising inside her all at once. She reached for his hand, gripping it hard. She was hyperventilating; she couldn\u2019t get her breath. She heard herself gasping for air. The world began to spin.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked, and his voice seemed to come from a long way off. \u201cAre you ill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...don\u2019t know,\u201d she said on a choked whisper, the panic settling in. Suddenly she felt an overwhelming need to find her mother.</p><p>\u201cWhat should I do?\u201d he asked, placing his arm protectively around her shoulders. \u201cShould I take you to the clinic? Call for an Aid Car?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, feeling small and lost and childlike. \u201cI...I want my mother.\u201d</p><p>Warren didn\u2019t hesitate. He leaped to his feet. \u201cI\u2019ll get her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She tried not to sob. She was an adult. She should be more capable of dealing with the events in her own life. Looking at Warren, she forced herself to take deep, even breaths. She forced her heart to stop racing.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re having a panic attack,\u201d Warren said, brushing damp hair from her temple. \u201cMy poor Justine. Where\u2019s Seth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cH-home.\u201d She couldn\u2019t, wouldn\u2019t tell him anything more.</p><p>\u201cShould I phone him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I\u2014I\u2019m fine now,\u201d she said shakily.</p><p>Warren slipped his arm around her and held her head against his shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about a thing,\u201d he whispered soothingly. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d</p><p>Two</p><p>Clutching her textbooks, Allison Cox rushed from her first-period American History to her French class. She slid into her desk and ignored the whispers that ceased abruptly as soon as she entered the room.</p><p>No one needed to tell her the topic of conversation. She knew. Everyone was whispering about Anson. Her friends assumed he was the one who\u2019d burned down The Lighthouse. He wasn\u2019t! She refused to believe he was in any way responsible for the fire. Anson wouldn\u2019t do anything so underhanded to the Gundersons. Not only had they been good to him, he wasn\u2019t that kind of person. He wasn\u2019t cruel or vindictive. Allison didn\u2019t care what anyone thought or said\u2014she wouldn\u2019t lose faith in Anson or the love they shared.</p><p>Turning, she glared over her shoulder at Kaci and Emily. According to her so-called friends, she was walking hand in hand with denial. Fine, they could think whatever they wanted; it had nothing to do with her. They could condemn Anson, but she wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>The class bell rang, and she slowly turned around, ignoring the flow of gossip. Yes, Anson had disappeared right after the fire. Yes, he\u2019d burned down the shed in the park. But she just couldn\u2019t accept that he\u2019d had anything to do with what had happened at The Lighthouse.</p><p>She\u2019d convinced herself that Anson would return to Cedar Cove soon. With all her heart, she believed he\u2019d be back by graduation. She clung to that hope, focused on the date\u2014June fourth\u2014and refused to doubt him.</p><p>The afternoon dragged by. Every day had since she\u2019d seen him the night of the fire. After her last class she couldn\u2019t get away fast enough. She hurried off the school grounds to her part-time job at her dad\u2019s accounting firm. As she walked to the building owned by her father and his partners, she reviewed the facts as she remembered them. She did this often; she went over and over every detail she could recall. Logically, she understood why someone who didn\u2019t know Anson might conclude that he was an arsonist. Okay, so he\u2019d made that one mistake last fall, with the park shed. But he\u2019d owned up to it, taken his punishment and moved on.</p><p>It\u2019d been a week since she\u2019d seen him\u2014the longest week of her life. She remembered how he\u2019d come to her that night. She\u2019d been asleep and he\u2019d tapped against her bedroom window, waking her. It wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019d appeared in the middle of the night, only now he wouldn\u2019t come inside. He\u2019d explained that the only reason he was there was to tell her goodbye.</p><p>She\u2019d argued with him, but he\u2019d been adamant, insisting he had to leave. So many questions remained unanswered, including the issue of the missing money. Anson swore he knew nothing about that and she believed him. Mr. Gunderson was wrong to blame Anson for a crime he didn\u2019t commit.</p><p>Worse, according to the terms of his plea agreement, the agreement Anson had made with the court after the first arson, he\u2019d pledged to stay in school and make restitution.</p><p>But Anson hadn\u2019t been in school the week before the fire, and Allison had been worried sick, wondering where he was and what he was doing. No one seemed to have any idea, and no one seemed to care, either. Not even his mother.</p><p>Anson had said he was leaving and wouldn\u2019t tell her where he was going or when he\u2019d be back. He\u2019d kissed her goodbye and although she\u2019d pleaded with him to stay, to talk things out, he\u2019d disappeared into the night.</p><p>The next morning, on one of the worst days of her life, Allison\u2019s mother, Rosie, woke her and said Sheriff Troy Davis needed to ask her a few questions. That was when she\u2019d learned about The Lighthouse. As best she could, Allison answered the sheriff\u2019s questions\u2014except she didn\u2019t tell him everything. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Not even her parents knew the full truth.</p><p>She dared not tell her dad for fear he\u2019d lose his trust in Anson\u2014and in her.</p><p>Allison was grateful for this job at her father\u2019s office.

Anson\u2019s own mother had turned her back on him; Cherry Butler had as much as said that her son deserved whatever he got. Nor did she seem terribly concerned that Anson had now disappeared. According to Cherry, he\u2019d come back when he was ready, and until then, she wasn\u2019t wasting any time worrying about him. Allison was horrified by his mother\u2019s attitude.</p><p>If Allison had run away, she knew her parents would never stop looking for her. And they wouldn\u2019t ever give up on her, like Anson\u2019s mother had on him.</p><p>But then, that was what Anson had said the night he left\u2014that Allison was lucky. She had parents who loved her and cared about her. Anson claimed no one gave a damn about him. He was wrong. Allison cared. Her parents, too, were concerned about him, although of course their primary goal was to protect Allison.</p><p>Some kids were born lucky, Anson had told her, and she was one of them. He wasn\u2019t. He insisted that he had to make his own luck.</p><p>As she opened the front door of Smith, Cox and Jefferson, Allison noticed that the reception area was full of clients who\u2019d waited until the last minute to file their taxes. With only four days to go until April fifteenth, she sensed the uneasiness in the room. It was like this every year.</p> <p>Mary Lou, the receptionist, returned Allison\u2019s smile. \u201cThere\u2019s someone to see you in the kitchen,\u201d she said.</p><p>For a fleeting moment Allison thought it might be Anson. It couldn\u2019t be, though. The minute he showed up, the sheriff\u2019s office would become involved. Her father would be duty-bound to call them. Because Sheriff Davis suspected Anson would try to contact her at some point, her parents had discussed the possibility and the action they\u2019d have to take. The matter was out of her hands and her father\u2019s, too. Allison had no choice but to accept that.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Another smile appeared on the receptionist\u2019s face. \u201cYou\u2019ll just have to check it out for yourself.\u201d</p><p>Allison was puzzled, since it wasn\u2019t like Mary Lou to be so mysterious.</p><p>The kitchen, located behind the office, wasn\u2019t a real kitchen\u2014more of a lunchroom, with a microwave and a small refrigerator, plus a table and four chairs. Most days, Allison stuck her schoolbooks and purse in a cupboard there. As she walked into the room, she saw a baby carrier\u2014complete with baby\u2014resting on the table.</p> <p>\u201cCecilia!\u201d she cried, delighted beyond words. Her father\u2019s assistant had been a good friend to Allison, a better friend than either of her parents would ever know.</p><p>Three years earlier, Zach and Rosie Cox had divorced. It had been a terrible time for their family, especially Allison. She\u2019d rebelled, hanging out with the wrong crowd. Her grades had slipped drastically and she\u2019d stopped caring about much of anything.</p><p>When her father offered her a part-time job, she wasn\u2019t fooled. She\u2019d been well aware that the only reason he was willing to hire her was to keep an eye on her after school. She\u2019d taken the job, but she\u2019d gone into it with a bad attitude.</p><p>Then she discovered she wouldn\u2019t be working for her dad. He\u2019d assigned her to assist Cecilia Randall, and the young navy wife had helped Allison understand her own behavior\u2014what she was doing and why. Cecilia\u2019s parents had divorced when she was ten and she understood the pain Allison was feeling. Cecilia had guided her out of the self-destructive rut into which she\u2019d stumbled.</p><p>As soon as Cecilia saw Allison now, she opened her arms wide for a hug. \u201cI decided Aaron could do with a day out in the sunshine,\u201d her friend said, wrapping her arms around Allison and pulling her close. The baby was only three weeks old, so Cecilia hadn\u2019t been out of the office long. It felt like an eternity, though, because so much had happened.</p><p>Clasping Allison\u2019s shoulders, Cecilia leaned back and studied her. \u201cYou look...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDreadful,\u201d Allison muttered. With everyone else, including her parents, she could pretend, but not with Cecilia. She wasn\u2019t sleeping nights, and she\u2019d grown so weary of carrying this burden of worry and fear.</p><p>\u201cAnson,\u201d Cecilia whispered.</p> <p>Allison nodded.</p><p>The baby began to cry, demanding attention. He was loosely covered with the blanket Allison had knit. At first glance she thought Aaron resembled Cecilia\u2019s husband, Ian, but as she studied the baby, Allison saw plenty of his mother in him, too.</p><p>\u201cOh, Cecilia, he\u2019s adorable,\u201d she whispered, giving Aaron her finger to hold. The infant immediately clutched it with one tiny hand, and she was surprised by the strength of his grip.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s already spoiled,\u201d Cecilia said, smiling fondly down on her son. \u201cIt\u2019s bad enough that I\u2019m at his beck and call, but you should see Ian. You\u2019d think the sun rose and set on this baby.\u201d</p><p>Because Cecilia and Ian\u2019s first baby had died shortly after her birth, Allison knew how precious this child was to her friend. Aaron started to fuss again, more loudly this time. Cecilia lifted him out of the carrier and sat down at the table. \u201cI think I\u2019d better nurse him for a few minutes,\u201d she said, draping the blanket over her shoulder while she unfastened her blouse and expertly arranged her son.</p><p>\u201cSit,\u201d she ordered Allison, gesturing with her head at the chair beside her.</p><p>Allison willingly complied. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted to talk to you so badly,\u201d she said. Thankfully, no one had come in search of her. Busy though the staff was, they seemed to know that Allison needed this time with Cecilia, just the two of them.</p><p>\u201cYou can call me whenever you need to,\u201d Cecilia assured her. \u201cI worried about you when I didn\u2019t hear anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Cecilia said as she nursed her infant son. Her gaze was focused on Aaron. With her free hand, she stroked the wisps of hair at his temple.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember that when we first met, I was going out with Ryan Wilson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kid with the paper-clip earring?\u201d Cecilia asked, grinning down at her son as if to suggest she dreaded the day he\u2019d become a teenager. \u201cI believe your father might\u2019ve have mentioned him.\u201d</p><p>Allison felt embarrassed now to recall how foolish she\u2019d been. Ryan was trouble, and getting involved with him had been a blatant attempt to pay her parents back for their selfishness\u2014what she saw now as their temporary insanity. Soon after that, her parents had reconciled, and before the summer was out they\u2019d remarried.</p><p>\u201cAnson isn\u2019t anything like Ryan.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cPeople might think he is, but Anson\u2019s a much better person. He\u2019s smart and loyal and kind. Ryan isn\u2019t any of those things. He isn\u2019t even in school anymore. I have no idea where he is.\u201d But she had no idea where Anson was, either....</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d Cecilia said calmly, \u201cand the reason I do is your father. He would never have gone out of his way to help if he thought Anson would hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has hurt me,\u201d Allison protested, clenching her fists. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why he ran away.\u201d She wondered if Anson considered what a terrible position he\u2019d put her in. She realized that he didn\u2019t have the luxury of thinking about anyone but himself. He had to escape, had to run. However, he\u2019d left Allison to face his detractors, alone, and she was afraid.</p><p>\u201cSometimes people don\u2019t know how to deal with pain,\u201d Cecilia said, her gaze still on her baby. \u201cThe only way they can react is by running.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat only makes things worse,\u201d Allison said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wise to recognize that,\u201d Cecilia told her. \u201cBut unfortunately, Anson hasn\u2019t figured it out. My guess is he\u2019s hurt and confused, and taking off was kind of a knee-jerk reaction to pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere would he go?\u201d As far as she knew, Anson didn\u2019t have any family. His mother was a sorry excuse for a parent, and he\u2019d never known his father. Not once had Anson mentioned grandparents or uncles or aunts. She\u2019d racked her brain, trying to work out where he could possibly find a hiding place. She hoped he was safe and had enough to eat.</p><p>\u201cMom and Dad said the minute he contacts me I need to call Sheriff Davis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>Allison agreed, although she didn\u2019t like it. \u201cAnson is what the sheriff called a person of interest.\u201d She was interested, too, darn it. She had questions of her own.</p><p>As soon as Aaron was finished, Cecilia buttoned her blouse and placed the baby over her shoulder, rubbing his back. \u201cEverything\u2019s going to work out, Allison. If Anson is innocent\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is,\u201d she said vehemently.</p><p>Cecilia raised her head abruptly, staring at Allison. Her dark eyes seemed to burn straight through her. \u201cThere\u2019s something you\u2019re not telling me, isn\u2019t there?\u201d</p><p>Allison swallowed convulsively.</p><p>\u201cI can see from the look in your eyes.\u201d Cecilia paused, waiting. \u201cAllison? Have you heard from him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllison?\u201d she asked again, her voice calm. \u201cYou\u2019d better tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I\u2019m not sure....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you afraid?\u201d</p><p>Lowering her head, Allison bit her lip. \u201cNo one else knows,\u201d she murmured. Last week, when the sheriff had come to speak to her, she\u2019d answered all his questions\u2014to the letter. But he hadn\u2019t asked about this particular thing, and Allison hadn\u2019t volunteered the information.</p><p>\u201cYou can trust me,\u201d Cecilia added. \u201cYou know I want only the best for you.\u201d</p><p>Allison nodded. \u201cYou won\u2019t tell anyone?\u201d She tried to keep the pleading out of her voice.</p><p>\u201cIf you ask me not to say anything, I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to anyone,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Allison took a deep breath. \u201cIf I tell you...you might think\u2014you might believe Anson set the fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not withholding evidence, are you?\u201d Cecilia asked urgently. \u201cBecause that would change everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I couldn\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia sighed with relief. \u201cGood, because that would make you an accessory.\u201d</p><p>Sheriff Davis and her parents had already explained this. \u201cI answered all his questions truthfully,\u201d she said.</p><p>Cecilia frowned. \u201cThis was a sin of omission, then?\u201d</p><p>Allison slowly released her breath. \u201cThat night...when Anson knocked on my bedroom window.\u201d</p><p>She glanced up and Cecilia nodded, encouraging her to continue.</p><p>\u201cWe talked, and...and then he came into my room.\u201d Her mother had been really upset when Allison admitted that; she could only imagine what Rosie would say if she knew the rest. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>Allison hesitated again. \u201cHe...he was in my room for a few minutes and then he left and when he did\u2014\u201d She nearly choked on her words.</p><p>Cecilia leaned closer.</p><p>Allison could hardly make herself say it. \u201cI...I could smell smoke.\u201d Her throat was painfully dry. \u201cNot at first, I didn\u2019t, because all I could concentrate on was not letting him leave. I noticed a smell but I didn\u2019t think about it. Later I did, and when I realized what it was, I cried myself to sleep.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnson smelled of smoke?\u201d Cecilia whispered the question.</p><p>\u201cLike that other time,\u201d Allison said shakily. \u201cAs if...as if he\u2019d been standing close to a bonfire.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia\u2019s shoulders sagged and she closed her eyes.</p><p>It was just as Allison had feared. Now even Cecilia believed Anson had burned down The Lighthouse.</p><p>Three</p> <p>Arching her back, Maryellen Bowman shifted positions on the sofa, her temporary bed. The family living room had become her prison as the pregnancy moved into its final trimester. Jon was gone for the afternoon with Katie, their three-year-old daughter, so the house was quiet, peaceful. Maryellen knew she should try to rest. The problem was, she couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Worries assailed her from all sides. She worried about her unborn baby and this difficult pregnancy. She worried about the pressures her husband was under as he struggled to support their family now that The Lighthouse, where he\u2019d once worked as chef, was gone. She worried about his photographic career, her marriage and all the mistakes she\u2019d made. The worst one had come from the best intentions. Maryellen had tried so hard to heal the rift between Jon and his parents, and it had nearly destroyed her relationship with her husband.</p><p>She found it impossible to rest, and yet that was what the doctor had ordered\u2014bed rest for the remainder of this pregnancy. She was forbidden to climb stairs or exert herself in any way.</p><p>Yet how could she lie around when so much needed to be done? Leaning against the sofa, she closed her eyes and fought back depression. It\u2019d never been like this when she carried Katie. That pregnancy had been normal in every respect.</p><p>Then she\u2019d miscarried their second child. The emotional costs of this third pregnancy had yet to be calculated. Still, they both desperately wanted their child. All Maryellen could do was follow her doctor\u2019s instructions, try not to worry and pray that the baby would be born healthy and whole.</p><p>Because she was bedridden, everyone had pitched in. Her mother, especially, helped as much as she could, coming by twice a week with dinner and looking after Katie as often as her own busy life would allow. This gave both Jon and Maryellen a much-needed break. She hated to intrude on her mother, since Grace and Cliff were newly married and just now setting up house together. Grace had her own adjustments to make without taking on Maryellen\u2019s problems.</p> <p>The phone rang and Maryellen grabbed it, eager for any distraction.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said, hoping her voice disguised the self-pity she\u2019d fallen into.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Ellen Bowman. Is everything all right?\u201d</p><p>Her mother-in-law\u2019s sympathy nearly overwhelmed her, bringing her close to tears. Maryellen felt dreadful, about as low as she\u2019d been in her entire life, other than during her brief first marriage. \u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d she managed to tell her.</p><p>\u201cAnd Jon?\u201d Ellen asked hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s...\u201d Maryellen was willing to stretch the truth about her own state of mind and health, but she couldn\u2019t lie about her husband\u2019s. \u201cNot well, Ellen. He\u2019s not doing well at all.\u201d</p><p>Her mother-in-law grew quiet. \u201cJoseph and I thought that might be the case. I know Jon\u2019s angry. He\u2019s made it abundantly clear that he doesn\u2019t want anything to do with either of us. His attitude\u2019s killing his father. But I know you\u2019ve tried to talk to him, and we both appreciate your efforts more than we can say.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen had paid a high price for interfering between Jon and his parents and she dared not do it again. She and Jon had actually separated for a time, just before the miscarriage, because of her attempts to effect a reconciliation. Afterward, they\u2019d sidestepped the whole issue. But earlier in the month, soon after she\u2019d begun her regimen of bed rest, Jon had conceded that they didn\u2019t have any choice other than to ask his family for help.</p> <p>Yet he hadn\u2019t made the phone call, hadn\u2019t contacted them in any way, at least not that Maryellen knew about. Instead, they struggled from day to day until she feared their lives were about to implode. Neither Jon nor Maryellen could continue living with this constant, unrelenting stress.</p><p>\u201cJon was going to phone you,\u201d Maryellen said. \u201cHe told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was?\u201d Hope elevated Ellen\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t, because, well, because he\u2019s afraid, I think, and proud. Too proud.\u201d</p><p>Ellen laughed softly. \u201cHe\u2019s like his father in that regard.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen smiled and tried to relax. This nervous tension was bad for the baby, bad for her, bad all around. At her last appointment, Dr. DeGroot had emphasized the importance of staying calm. When he\u2019d said she should try to keep her life stress-free, she\u2019d nearly laughed out loud.</p><p>\u201cJoseph and I ordered the Cedar Cove Chronicle mailed to us here in Oregon,\u201d Ellen said, \u201cand we read about the fire at The Lighthouse. We know Jon went back to work there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s terrible news.\u201d Without his job as chef, Jon was left with only his photography earnings to support the family. His work was displayed in a Seattle gallery and sold well, but the money he made wasn\u2019t nearly enough to cover their living expenses, particularly now that Maryellen no longer had medical insurance.</p><p>\u201cJon\u2019s not working anywhere else, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis photographs are selling nicely,\u201d Maryellen felt obliged to tell her. \u201cHe\u2019s so talented.\u201d It was through his art that Maryellen had first come to know Jon Bowman. He\u2019d brought his photographs for display at the Harbor Street Gallery, where she was employed as manager. They were among the most popular in the gallery.</p><p>Unlike some of the other artists, Jon preferred to keep a low profile. It wasn\u2019t until after Katie was born that she\u2019d learned this man she loved had spent time in prison. In order to save their younger son, his parents had lied and Jon had been sentenced for a crime he\u2019d never committed.</p><p>\u201cJoseph and I want to help,\u201d Ellen insisted. \u201cWhat can we do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure...\u201d She didn\u2019t feel comfortable stating the obvious\u2014that she needed someone here, in the house, looking after Katie, preparing meals, cleaning.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something wrong,\u201d Ellen said sharply. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m having problems with the pregnancy,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI\u2019m on complete bed rest.\u201d The baby gave her a hard kick as if to remind her.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Katie? You can\u2019t possibly be taking care of her if you\u2019re confined to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. I can\u2019t. She\u2019s with her father,\u201d Maryellen said. Jon was doing his best to sell his work and take care of their child, run the household, and everything else.</p><p>\u201cBut how can he do that?\u201d Ellen asked, clearly concerned.</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t.\u201d Maryellen was unwilling to explain further.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re coming,\u201d Ellen announced. \u201cYou both need us.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen sighed, feeling a surge of relief and simultaneous anxiety about Jon\u2019s reaction. \u201cI can\u2019t ask you to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t,\u201d Ellen said. \u201cOur son will just have to swallow his silly pride. His family\u2019s at stake here. As far as I\u2019m concerned, this is God\u2019s way of bringing us all back together. Jon can\u2019t very well ignore us now. He\u2019s our son, and Katie and this new baby are our grandchildren.\u201d Ellen sounded like a force to be reckoned with.</p><p>\u201cLet me talk to him first,\u201d Maryellen urged.</p><p>\u201cYou do that if you want, but it doesn\u2019t make the least bit of difference what he says. Joseph and I are coming to Cedar Cove, and that\u2019s that. Leave everything to me, Maryellen,\u201d she insisted in a determined voice. \u201cI\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d</p><p>They ended the conversation and afterward Maryellen did feel better. She didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d say to Jon. Maybe she wouldn\u2019t broach the subject, after all. Maybe she would leave everything to Ellen and Joseph. She was so weary of fighting him on this. He\u2019d relented once and agreed to ask his family for help and then done nothing. She couldn\u2019t face that battle again.</p><p>Just as she was beginning to think it was time for Jon and Katie to return home, she heard a car pull into the yard. Trying to look rested and relaxed, she attempted a smile, waiting for her husband and daughter to walk into the house.</p><p>Instead the doorbell rang.</p><p>Visitors? In the middle of the day?</p><p>Before Maryellen could move, the door opened and Rachel Pendergast and Teri Miller entered, letting in warm spring air and sunshine and laughter. They worked at Get Nailed, the salon where Maryellen had her hair and nails done. Or used to...</p><p>\u201cRachel? Teri?\u201d Maryellen couldn\u2019t have been more surprised\u2014and delighted. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are on a mission of mercy,\u201d Rachel declared. She set a white take-out bag on the coffee table in front of Maryellen, then reached for her hand. Shaking her head, Rachel gave a disparaging sigh. \u201cJust look at those nails,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cAnd I was thinking you could do with a haircut,\u201d Teri said cheerfully. \u201cAnd since we were coming, we decided to bring lunch for all of us.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen felt like laughing and crying at the same time. \u201cHow did you know I\u2019ve been longing for some TLC?\u201d she whispered, endeavoring not to weep.</p><p>\u201cA little birdie told us,\u201d Rachel said, grinning. She walked into the kitchen and collected three plates.</p><p>\u201cThis place is beautiful,\u201d Teri said. Hands on her ample hips, she glanced around. \u201cRachel said Jon did most of the work himself. Mighty talented husband you\u2019ve got there, my friend.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen had to agree. She liked both women immensely; Rachel had done her nails for years, while Teri had only recently started cutting Maryellen\u2019s hair. Teri had a flair for the outrageous and was genuinely entertaining. More than that, she was a kindhearted and compassionate person\u2014as her visit today proved.</p><p>Over the years, Maryellen had gotten to know them both pretty well, and at one time had tried to set Teri up with Jon. Now she was astonished that she\u2019d ever thought of such a thing. Teri and Jon were completely unsuited, but Maryellen hadn\u2019t even considered that. She\u2019d been fighting her own attraction to him and had managed to convince herself that if he turned his attention elsewhere, he\u2019d forget about her and vice versa. However, Jon was interested only in her.</p><p>\u201cWe brought you teriyaki chicken with rice and veggies,\u201d Rachel said as she pulled containers from the white sack.</p><p>Maryellen\u2019s appetite had been almost nonexistent for weeks. Jon had to coax her to eat at every meal. But all at once she was ravenous. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat sounds fabulous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Rachel handed her a filled plate and a pair of chopsticks.</p><p>Maryellen sat cross-legged on the sofa while her two friends arranged ottomans on the other side of the coffee table. The three of them dug into their lunch as Teri explained that it was from a new take-out place on the outskirts of Cedar Cove. They all proclaimed the food to be delicious and worth getting again. Teri had been considerate enough to leave a menu with Maryellen. \u201cFor when you guys just want to order in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I should cut your hair short,\u201d Teri said next. \u201cReally short. You\u2019ve got better things to do than fuss with your hair.\u201d</p> <p>Maryellen smiled. It was all she could do to get it combed every day. \u201cJon won\u2019t like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, he isn\u2019t the one who has to wash it and brush it,\u201d Teri said. \u201cHe\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen could imagine how he\u2019d react. The last time she\u2019d had more than a trim was soon after Katie\u2019s birth. Until then, Maryellen had worn her dark hair long and straight, reaching the middle of her back, much as it did now. Jon had never actually said he didn\u2019t like her new style, but she could sense that he\u2019d been disappointed. He often told her how much he loved her long, glossy hair, how beautiful he found it.</p><p>\u201cOkay, what do you mean by short?\u201d Maryellen asked.</p><p>Teri\u2019s dark eyes twinkled. \u201cWait and see.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI hope you realize I can\u2019t afford this,\u201d she felt obliged to remind her friends.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not your concern,\u201d Rachel was quick to tell her. \u201cIt\u2019s all been taken care of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d Teri added, \u201cincluded in the fee was a more-than-generous tip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho did this?\u201d Maryellen asked, although she could guess.</p><p>\u201cYour fairy godfather,\u201d Rachel told her. \u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCliff.\u201d Just as Maryellen had thought. Her new stepfather, Cliff Harding, had arranged this.</p> <p>\u201cLike I said,\u201d Rachel scolded, drawing two fingers across her mouth, \u201cmy lips are zipped.\u201d</p><p>The next two hours were such a pleasure. Teri washed her hair in the sink, and while she cut, dried and styled it, Rachel worked on her nails. God bless Cliff for this\u2014and so much else. Ever since her mother and Cliff had met, she\u2019d been impressed by what a loving, thoughtful man he was.</p><p>\u201cTell me the latest gossip,\u201d Maryellen said as the two women continued their beauty treatment.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Teri said, sighing deeply, \u201cthe biggest news is that Nate Olsen\u2019s back in town.\u201d</p><p>Nate was the young warrant officer Rachel had been seeing. Her friend had an ambiguous relationship with a widower named Bruce Peyton, which had gone on for three\u2014or was it four?\u2014years. Then this navy man had entered her life. Maryellen wondered which one Rachel would eventually choose.</p><p>\u201cWould you stop!\u201d Rachel cried. \u201cNate and I are dating casually, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen doubted the \u201ccasual\u201d part but didn\u2019t comment.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Bruce?\u201d she asked, knowing how close Rachel was to Bruce\u2019s daughter, Jolene.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re just friends.\u201d She brushed off the questions, sounding a bit impatient, but Maryellen suspected Rachel\u2019s feelings for Bruce went deeper than she realized.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I don\u2019t understand?\u201d Teri said, expertly wielding her scissors. \u201cRachel has two men on the line and I haven\u2019t hooked a single one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve put in your bid at the bachelor auction,\u201d Rachel teased, referring to the charity event at which she\u2019d \u201cbought\u201d Nate.</p><p>\u201cThose men were far too expensive for my pocketbook,\u201d Teri muttered, still clipping. Long pieces of hair fell to the floor.</p><p>She bent to gather up Maryellen\u2019s hair. \u201cWant to donate this to make a wig for a cancer patient?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSure!\u201d Maryellen felt good about giving to someone in need\u2014especially since she\u2019d received so much herself. \u201cThat\u2019s a wonderful idea.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later, Teri switched on the television to check the weekend weather. \u201cHey,\u201d she said, stepping back from the screen as the local news broadcast concluded. \u201cThere\u2019s a big chess championship coming to Seattle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you like chess?\u201d Maryellen asked.</p><p>Teri shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know much about it. It\u2019s a lot like checkers, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Rachel and Maryellen exchanged looks.</p><p>\u201cWell, not really,\u201d Rachel answered. \u201cIt\u2019s a little more complicated.\u201d</p><p>Soon after the two women finished, packed up their supplies and left, Jon and Katie got home. He seemed exhausted and Katie did, too. When Jon saw Maryellen, he did a double take.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d she asked tentatively, putting her hand to her head. Then she went on to explain how this change in her appearance had come about\u2014mentioning her satisfaction at donating her hair for a cancer wig.</p><p>Jon nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I love your new look. I\u2019ve always liked your hair long but this is...nice. Nice,\u201d he repeated. \u201cIt suits you and I can see that it\u2019s much more practical.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen was pleased at his response, which seemed exactly right to her. Katie crawled into her lap then and laid her head against Maryellen\u2019s shoulder. Within minutes, the little girl was fast asleep. Maryellen settled Katie on the sofa beside her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t ask Jon how his day had gone. His weary expression told her everything she needed to know. He\u2019d spent the day doing errands\u2014getting groceries, film, visiting the library.</p><p>\u201cSit with me awhile,\u201d she urged, sitting upright.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got stuff I have to do.\u201d</p><p>She patted the empty space next to her. \u201cJon,\u201d she whispered. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, and she knew he felt torn between the need to work while Katie napped and his desire to be with his wife. Her smile must have won him over because he sank down at her side and slipped one arm around her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI love you so much,\u201d she said.</p><p>Jon kissed her forehead. \u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a few months, this will all be over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt feels like it\u2019s gone on forever,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cGetting through these last few weeks of the pregnancy...That\u2019ll be the most difficult. Things will get worse before they get better.\u201d</p><p>He released a deep, pent-up sigh. \u201cWe\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so, too.\u201d She turned her head in order to meet his gaze. \u201cYour stepmother phoned this afternoon,\u201d she said, not bothering with a preamble.</p><p>Jon stiffened but said nothing. Then he asked. \u201cDid she call or did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe phoned,\u201d Maryellen assured him, refusing to take offense at the question. \u201cThey read about the fire at The Lighthouse because they get the Chronicle. She called to see if everything was all right with us.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond for a long moment. \u201cSo they know I\u2019m not working?\u201d he finally asked. \u201cAt a job, I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey know,\u201d she said. \u201cI told her about the problems with the pregnancy, too.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t happy about that, she could tell, but he didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask her to do it, I want you to understand that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here and help. Ellen insisted. She said these are her grandchildren and we need help.\u201d</p><p>Still Jon refused to comment.</p><p>\u201cSay something,\u201d she said, fearing his reaction. On top of everything else, she couldn\u2019t bear his anger. It would break her.</p><p>\u201cThey can\u2019t stay here.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want them around the house when I\u2019m here.\u201d The arm that cradled her lay heavily on her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure they understand that.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t like this, but I\u2019ll do it for you and Katie and for the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t change anything, Maryellen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She pressed her head against him. A minute later, she felt him relax again.</p><p>\u201cLove does that to a man, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cMakes you do things you don\u2019t want to for the people you love. Things you never thought you\u2019d do.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen knew what he was saying. Jon had vowed that he would not allow his family back in his life after what they\u2019d done to him. Yet here he was, setting aside his deepest convictions because Ellen and Joseph were willing to help in this impossible situation. He\u2019d agreed to let them into the fringes of his life for Maryellen\u2019s sake and Katie\u2019s. There might be no forgiveness in his heart, but he\u2019d set aside his anger to serve his wife\u2019s needs.</p><p>\u201cLove makes us put other people first,\u201d she said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that what you mean?\u201d Isn\u2019t that what love is?</p><p>Four</p><p>Justine could barely stand to look at the burned-out husk that had once been The Lighthouse. Most of the structure had collapsed and the charred remains were a blight against the vivid blue backdrop of the cove. Yellow crime-scene tape stretched across the parking lot. Even now, two weeks after the fire, the acrid smell of burned wood and smoke hung oppressively in the air.</p><p>Seth stood at her side and Robert Beckman, the insurance claims adjuster, was with them. He made notes on a clipboard as they surveyed the site together. Leif, thank goodness, was in preschool. As much as she could, Justine wanted to protect her son from all this.</p><p>Her panic attack the week before had shaken her. She hadn\u2019t told Seth about meeting Warren. There seemed no reason to do so. Knowing she\u2019d been anywhere close to the other man would only upset him, although her husband had nothing to worry about. Her love for Seth and their family was rock-solid. Warren had been kind to her, and for that she was grateful. He\u2019d asked her to join him for lunch; she\u2019d declined and hadn\u2019t talked to him since.</p><p>\u201cHow much longer will the investigation take?\u201d Seth asked, keeping pace with the adjuster.</p><p>Justine wrapped her hand around his arm in silent entreaty. Seth was still bitter and impatient, yearning to move forward after the fire and resentful of every delay. Already he was talking about rebuilding, eager to get their business and their lives back on track. More than eager, he\u2019d become obsessive. Every drawback, every question, frustrated him. He couldn\u2019t sleep and the stress had begun to affect his emotional health.</p><p>\u201cI know it seems to be taking a long time,\u201d Robert said in a soothing voice. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s already been over two weeks,\u201d Seth snapped. \u201cWhat else is there to investigate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to forgive my husband, Mr. Beckman,\u201d Justine said quietly. \u201cAs you can imagine, this fire has been very difficult for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI completely understand,\u201d the older man assured her. \u201cAs I was saying, I know it seems like a long time, but I do promise you that we\u2019re working as quickly and efficiently as we can.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to snap.\u201d Seth gave a helpless shrug. \u201cIt\u2019s just that every day we\u2019re not open for business we lose customers and staff.\u201d Word had come that morning that their head waiter had taken a job in Tacoma. Dion wouldn\u2019t be easily replaced. It was inevitable that the rest of their staff would find other employment, as well. No one could go without a paycheck for long.</p><p>\u201cThe company recognizes that, but we can\u2019t do anything until the fire marshal gives us an opportunity to survey the damage thoroughly. And because this is a criminal investigation, it\u2019s simply going to require more time.\u201d</p><p>Justine knew that Seth had made numerous phone calls to the fire marshal in an effort to get the investigation moving.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve contacted an architect,\u201d Seth explained, and Justine barely managed to conceal her shock. She\u2019d had no idea. \u201cWe\u2019ve been discussing design plans,\u201d he went on, \u201cand I\u2019d like to set up a construction schedule. I can\u2019t do that until the fire marshal releases the property.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell...you may have to wait a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen can we rebuild?\u201d Seth demanded.</p><p>Robert Beckman slowly shook his head. \u201cSince the fire appears to have been arson, the company would like to bring in a \u2018Cause and Origin\u2019 investigator.\u201d He paused. \u201cThis is in addition to what your local people are doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will he do?\u201d Justine wanted to know. \u201cYour investigator, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis\u2014or her\u2014primary purpose is to confirm the preliminary finding of arson. Our investigators do that by looking at flame patterns to see where the fire started.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow could anyone tell anything from a heap of ashes?\u201d Impatience rang in Seth\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s astonishing the information they can derive from the site. They\u2019re able to distinguish exactly where the fire originated. They can determine the accelerant. Sometimes there are other clues they can find by sifting through the debris. There are certainly cases in which their investigations have led to the apprehension and conviction of arsonists. I remember one instance in which\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all well and good, but what should I tell the architect?\u201d Seth broke in. He ran his fingers forcefully through his hair.</p><p>Justine was horrified that Seth had already spoken to an architect and wondered when he\u2019d done this. He\u2019d been gone a couple of afternoons but hadn\u2019t mentioned where he was or with whom. Nor had Justine questioned him. The truth was, it had been a relief to have him out of the house. Seth found it impossible to remain in any one place. When he was home, he stalked from room to room, unable to work at anything or even read for more than a few minutes. Unable to relax.</p><p>\u201cYour policy covers loss of income for a year,\u201d Robert Beckman continued, flipping a page on his clipboard. \u201cIf construction time goes over that, we can request an extension.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the sooner we get started, the better, don\u2019t you agree?\u201d Seth asked. \u201cFor the company and for us.\u201d</p> <p>Robert gave another of his soothing replies, and unwilling to listen to any more, Justine walked across the parking lot to stand at the farthest edge, which overlooked the cove. The wind carried a briny scent on this overcast day, shrouding the pungent smell of smoke.</p><p>The view of the cove always calmed her. She absorbed that peace now, needing it to settle her pounding heart. Seth had taken matters into his own hands; without so much as talking to her, he\u2019d held discussions with an architect. When they\u2019d first conceived the idea of The Lighthouse, Justine had been involved in every aspect of the planning. Now Seth had excluded her.</p><p>The fire and its aftermath were so much worse than she would ever have believed. Her husband had turned into a stranger, a man Justine neither knew nor liked. The temptation to escape, to pack a suitcase and disappear, grew stronger every day. Warren had offered her the use of a summer cottage on Hood Canal. It sounded so peaceful there. Leif would love to walk along the beach, exploring, wading in the water. She could picture him now, digging for clams with his small shovel, his laughter spilling out into the wind. Not once since Leif was born had they taken a family vacation. The Lighthouse had filled every waking minute. Only in the absence of the restaurant and its demands was she beginning to see how completely it had taken over their lives.</p><p>\u201cJustine.\u201d Seth placed his hand on her shoulder as he came up behind her. \u201cEverything\u2019s going to be all right, sweetheart,\u201d he said, his voice conciliatory.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d The fire, the destruction of the restaurant, was no longer her main concern. What worried her was the effect it\u2019d had on her husband.</p><p>\u201cI realize I\u2019ve been a little cranky lately.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and pressed her hand on top of his. To say he\u2019d been \u201ca little cranky\u201d was an understatement of major proportions.</p><p>\u201cEverything will be all right,\u201d he said again, \u201conce we find out who did this to us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWill it?\u201d she asked, but apparently Seth didn\u2019t hear her because he didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>Justine tilted her head to one side so her cheek could rest against his hand. \u201cYou\u2019re already talking about rebuilding,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cOf course. I want to get started as soon as possible. Don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, you don\u2019t know?\u201d He laughed and seemed to assume she was joking. \u201cWe\u2019re in the restaurant business. This is how we make our living. Unless we rebuild, we won\u2019t have an income.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but...\u201d</p><p>Her husband went still for a moment. \u201cI can\u2019t go back to fishing, Justine.\u201d</p><p>Being a professional fisherman was a hard, dangerous life, and they\u2019d agreed that Seth would give it up for good. His father had encouraged him in that decision.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want you to fish,\u201d she said, turning so she could slip her arms around his middle. \u201cI\u2019m just not sure I want to be a restaurant owner anymore.\u201d</p><p>Seth gripped her shoulders, his fingers digging into her flesh. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean that. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I do,\u201d she countered. \u201cAt least I think I do. We went into this business with absolutely no knowledge of what we were letting ourselves in for. We were totally naive about what owning a restaurant takes out of you.\u201d</p><p>According to statistics, eight out of ten new businesses fail, and restaurants headed the list. The only reason theirs had been successful was the sheer force of their combined efforts\u2014and a degree of luck.</p><p>\u201cWe made a few mistakes,\u201d Seth said, then added with a wry grin, \u201cokay, we made a lot of mistakes in the beginning, but we learned quickly and we\u2019ve come a long way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe hardly spend any time together, as a family.\u201d This was the one thing that distressed Justine the most.</p><p>Seth didn\u2019t agree or disagree with her.</p><p>\u201cYou were at the restaurant all hours of the day and night, and so was I.\u201d She supposed that now wasn\u2019t a particularly opportune moment to broach her concerns, not while Seth was still so upset.</p><p>\u201cI had to be there. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not blaming you for any of this,\u201d Justine told him, gazing into his intensely blue eyes. He was frowning at her and in him she read confusion and pain.</p><p>\u201cAre you suggesting I haven\u2019t been a good husband?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo! That isn\u2019t what I meant at all. I love you and you love me. I could never doubt that.\u201d Then, reluctantly, she said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid, Seth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid? Afraid of what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. I had a panic attack last week. I didn\u2019t know what it was at first. I felt like I wasn\u2019t getting enough air and that I was going to pass out.\u201d</p><p>Concern darkened his eyes. \u201cWhen? Why didn\u2019t you mention this earlier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could I? You\u2019ve been so angry, so restless. I didn\u2019t want to add to your worries.\u201d</p><p>He slid his arms around her, drawing her close. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, my love. So sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, too. About everything.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his head. \u201cWhat do you have to apologize for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t think I can go back to the way things were before, with you gone so many hours. With me at the restaurant virtually every day. I don\u2019t want our son spending every night with babysitters. I don\u2019t want to go back to the constant worries over money and meeting payroll. It was always something, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Once she started listing her concerns, she couldn\u2019t seem to stop. \u201cThis was never our plan, remember? I was going to do the books and fill in occasionally, but occasionally became every day. Leif is being raised by strangers and you have less and less time for us.\u201d</p><p>Seth frowned at her. \u201cYou never said any of this before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I hardly ever saw you, and when I did, we were usually talking about the restaurant. We wanted to have a second child and kept putting it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had practically no time to be a family. It doesn\u2019t make sense to have a second baby.\u201d She stared at him. \u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking that you aren\u2019t about to let all this hard work go to waste. That you didn\u2019t slave away for the last five years to end up with nothing more than a pile of rubble.\u201d</p><p>He looked startled, as though her observation had surprised him.</p><p>\u201cWe both need to decide what\u2019s really important,\u201d she said, nearly choking on her words. \u201cIs working thirteen-and fourteen-hour days worth what it\u2019s doing to us, to our son and to our marriage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he stated without question. \u201cYou\u2019re exaggerating, Justine. It isn\u2019t all bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree, but for me, the bad outweighs the good. I\u2019m no longer sure the sacrifice is worth it. I love you so much,\u201d she whispered, bringing her hands to his face, blinking back tears. \u201cI want my husband back\u2014the man I married. The man who proved to me I could love and be loved. I want to find what we once shared and I\u2019m so afraid it might be too late.\u201d</p><p>Seth crushed her to him then and held her tight. She felt him shudder, and he didn\u2019t speak for a moment.</p><p>\u201cI had no idea you felt this way,\u201d he finally said.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know it myself until the fire,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a mystery to me, too,\u201d she said with a shaky laugh. \u201cI guess I want us both to think long and hard before we decide whether or not to rebuild The Lighthouse.\u201d</p><p>She could tell from his sudden tension that he\u2019d prefer not to reconsider but to go ahead with his plans to rebuild. Justine swallowed, wondering if anything she\u2019d said had gotten through to him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not making any promises,\u201d Seth told her.</p><p>\u201cBut we can talk?\u201d she asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAll right,\u201d her husband agreed. \u201cWe can talk.\u201d</p><p>Five</p><p>With the Cedar Cove Chronicle folded to the classifieds, Cecilia read through the listing for rental houses one more time. Other navy couples had warned them that it was next to impossible to rent in a middle-class neighborhood without including the wife\u2019s income. Cecilia and Ian didn\u2019t want to do that. They\u2019d never be able to save for a house if most of their monthly pay went into rent. They wanted a home of their own, especially now that they had Aaron.</p><p>\u201cThe house is at 204 Rosewood Lane,\u201d Cecilia said as Ian drove. She turned to check on Aaron, who was sleeping peacefully in his carrier in the backseat.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t get your hopes up,\u201d Ian warned.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late\u2014they already are.\u201d Cecilia so badly wanted this to work out. Her parents had divorced when she was young and from that time forward, Cecilia and her mother had lived in apartments. She\u2019d always dreamed of one day having a home with a yard and a garden and a real neighborhood. Ian had grown up in a house, and living in one again didn\u2019t mean nearly as much to him as it did her. He was willing to wait until they could afford their own.</p><p>She\u2019d phoned about several possible places, and the one on Rosewood Lane was represented by an agent. Judy Flint, who worked for Cedar Cove Real Estate, was meeting them at the house.</p><p>He drove onto Rosewood Lane and Cecilia immediately liked the area. The street was lined with elm trees already in leaf and there were tulips and daffodils in front of almost every house. This was the kind of neighborhood where children rode their bicycles in the street, and the sidewalk was used for jump rope and other kid games. She saw a white picket fence and held her breath, hoping that 204 was the house number there.</p><p>It was.</p> <p>\u201cOh, Ian, look!\u201d she cried, breathless with excitement. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect.\u201d In fact, it was even better than she\u2019d dreamed. It was a white, two-story house with a large dormer over the front porch. Although this was clearly an older home, that didn\u2019t bother Cecilia and if anything, made its appeal stronger. She especially liked the wide porch and brick columns.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, I guess,\u201d Ian said as he parked the car by the curb.</p><p>Cecilia playfully slapped his arm. \u201cYou like it, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cLooks like a good family home.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d hardly put the vehicle in park when she unfastened the seat belt and climbed out. Judy Flint, the agent, was waiting at the front door, and the owners were due to show up later, if warranted. It seemed a bit unusual, but they\u2019d requested a meeting with any potential renters.</p><p>Ian extracted the baby carrier from the back seat and carried a napping Aaron onto the porch with him.</p> <p>\u201cAren\u2019t you adorable?\u201d The agent smiled at the baby. \u201cI see you\u2019re right on time,\u201d she told Ian and Cecilia in a friendly voice, still smiling at Aaron.</p><p>Cecilia had been ready an hour early and the wait had seemed interminable.</p><p>\u201cI think my wife wants to rent it sight unseen, but I\u2019d like a tour,\u201d Ian said, teasing Cecilia.</p><p>\u201cStep inside,\u201d Judy invited as she held open the screen door.</p><p>Gazing all around, Cecilia walked into the house. Even without furniture, the living room had a sense of warmth that came from the brick fireplace, polished oak floors and off-white walls. It was easy to imagine what this place would look like filled with their things.</p><p>She was still examining the living room when Ian called from the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little small in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in a minute,\u201d Cecilia called back. She was studying the fireplace with its built-in bookcases on each side. This was the perfect location for a rocking chair, where she could nurse Aaron, read, daydream....</p> <p>Ian returned to the living room. \u201cRemember this is the first house we\u2019ve seen. We\u2019ve only started to look. There are plenty of other rentals on our list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll remember,\u201d she promised, but Cecilia had made up her mind. This was it. All she had to do now was convince her husband. If they delayed, someone else would quickly snatch it up.</p><p>Ian disappeared, and a few minutes later she heard him say, \u201cI\u2019m going to check out the garage.\u201d Apparently he\u2019d already been through the ground floor and she had yet to move beyond the living room.</p><p>Taking in every detail, Cecilia made her way into the kitchen. Ian was right; the area was smaller than she would\u2019ve liked but it was adequate. She noticed that the back door had a doggie entrance. Perhaps they could get a dog sometime, she thought dreamily. A compact laundry room off the kitchen led to a hallway. She followed that and came to the larger of the two bedrooms. The master bedroom was painted a soft shade of yellow that looked fresh and new. The closet was small but again adequate.</p><p>\u201cThere are two other bedrooms upstairs,\u201d Judy, the agent, told her. \u201cFour bedrooms in all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour bedrooms,\u201d Cecilia repeated. It felt like a mansion.</p><p>\u201cThe basement is unfinished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has a basement, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe owner didn\u2019t use it for anything other than storage.\u201d</p><p>Ian bounced back into the house and the instant he did, Cecilia could tell he was happy. \u201cThe garage is great! Want to come see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Cecilia exchanged a smile with Judy Flint. Men and their garages. She trailed him outside and into the detached garage. Judy went with them and highlighted a number of features. There was plenty of room for Ian to work on his car, while leaving space for storage.</p><p>\u201cI do want to remind you that this is the first house we\u2019ve seen,\u201d Cecilia teased, throwing his own words back at him. \u201cSo don\u2019t get too excited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the best home I have available in your price range,\u201d Judy inserted.</p><p>Ian\u2019s eyes held Cecilia\u2019s. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019d be foolish to let this opportunity pass us by.\u201d</p><p>Ian reached for her hand and gave it a gentle squeeze.</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to contact the owners?\u201d Judy Flint asked.</p><p>Ian responded with an enthusiastic nod.</p><p>The agent walked outside, and Cecilia watched as she opened her cell phone.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s everything I\u2019d hoped for,\u201d Cecilia whispered. \u201cEverything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour bedrooms is a lot for just the three of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019ll be other babies,\u201d Cecilia said. \u201cWe could fill those bedrooms in no time.\u201d</p><p>Ian\u2019s eyebrows shot up and Cecilia giggled.</p><p>She was so happy she could barely contain herself and she could see Ian was just as pleased.</p><p>She thought he might have kissed her right then, except that the agent returned. \u201cThe owners are in town and they\u2019ll be here in about ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>As Cecilia and Ian finished exploring the rest of the house, including the two upstairs bedrooms, she noticed that another car had parked out front. An older gentleman, wearing a large cowboy hat and boots, and a middle-aged woman started up the walkway toward the house.</p><p>Judy Flint opened the front door for them and introduced Grace and Cliff Harding. Cecilia smiled shyly at the other couple. When Aaron began to fuss, she lifted him from the carrier and held him against her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s unusual for the owners to ask for a meeting with potential renters,\u201d Grace said.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t mind,\u201d Cecilia assured her. She recognized Grace from the library. Before she had her own computer, Cecilia had made several trips to use the ones in the library whenever Ian was at sea, so she remembered Grace, who\u2019d been helpful and friendly. \u201cWe like your home very much and we\u2019ll take the very best care of it.\u201d</p><p>The older gentleman put his arm around his wife. \u201cGrace and her family lived here for over thirty years and she wants to be sure it\u2019s in good hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be,\u201d Cecilia promised her. She understood why Grace would want to interview anyone who might be renting her house. It must be hard to let strangers move into a place that you\u2019d lived in for much of your life. And yet Cecilia understood why she was willing to walk away from her home of thirty years. Cliff Harding cherished her. She saw it in the way he touched his wife, the way he looked at her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in the navy?\u201d Cliff Harding asked Ian.</p><p>Ian nodded. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you could be transferred,\u201d Grace said, glancing at her husband. She seemed a little unsure.</p><p>\u201cWe could.\u201d Cecilia\u2019s heart would break if they had to leave Cedar Cove but she\u2019d go wherever Ian was assigned.</p><p>\u201cMs. Harding is asking for a one-year lease,\u201d Judy explained.</p><p>Ian paused. \u201cThat could be a problem,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019ve been a few rumors about the George Washington being transferred to San Diego. That might not mean anything, but then again, it could.\u201d He\u2019d mentioned this to Ceclia earlier, and she could only hope the rumors came to nothing.</p><p>\u201cWould you consider a lease-to-own option?\u201d she asked. She should\u2019ve talked this over with Ian first and wished she had, but if that was an option, she wanted to know.</p><p>Again Grace looked at her husband. \u201cI...don\u2019t know. I\u2019d like some time to think that over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure...Ian and I aren\u2019t even sure we could afford to own a house this big.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll discuss all of that later.\u201d Ian gestured around him. \u201cAs my wife said, we\u2019d take care of your home the same way you have,\u201d he told Grace. \u201cBut if you need a one-year lease, we won\u2019t be able to sign it.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia held her breath while she waited for Grace\u2019s response.</p><p>\u201cShould we look elsewhere?\u201d Ian pressed.</p><p>After the briefest of hesitations, Cliff Harding shrugged and seemed to leave the matter up to Grace.</p><p>Cecilia wasn\u2019t sure what else to say, so she asked, \u201cIs there space to plant a garden?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, I\u2019ve always had a garden\u2014roses and bulb flowers and perennials. Pretty well everything should be coming up, but there\u2019s certainly room for more. And the yard gets plenty of afternoon sun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted a garden,\u201d Cecilia confessed. She patted Aaron\u2019s back gently and soon the baby was sleeping contentedly on her shoulder.</p><p>Together the four of them walked around the house, while Judy waited inside. Ian and Mr. Harding were deep in conversation, and Cecilia had some questions for Grace, as well.</p><p>\u201cI do hope you\u2019ll agree to rent to us even without a lease,\u201d Cecilia said when they\u2019d finished.</p><p>Grace smiled at her husband and nodded. \u201cMy hope was that this home would go to a family just like you. This neighborhood\u2019s a good place for a family and you\u2019ll fit right in.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, Cecilia thought she might cry. \u201cThank you both so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Mr. Harding said, raising his hands. \u201cThis is strictly Grace\u2019s decision.\u201d</p><p>Judy Flint rejoined them then. \u201cI\u2019ll get the paperwork going right away,\u201d she announced. \u201cAre you prepared to write me a check this afternoon?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSure am.\u201d Ian removed his checkbook from his hip pocket.</p><p>\u201cWhen could we move in?\u201d Cecilia asked, and had trouble keeping the excitement out of her voice.</p><p>The Realtor turned to Grace, who smiled. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, once the paperwork\u2019s signed, you have my blessing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Cecilia said over and over. \u201cOh, thank you.\u201d She couldn\u2019t stop smiling.</p> <p>Six</p><p>Linnette McAfee had been looking forward to this afternoon with Cal all week. Because of her work as a physician\u2019s assistant at the Cedar Cove Medical Center, her days off rotated. Fortunately, Cal\u2019s job with Cliff Harding allowed him to adjust his work schedule to hers. If not for such an understanding employer, Cal and Linnette might never have found a chance to be together.</p><p>Linnette\u2019s mother, Corrie, had purchased a date for her with Cal at the Dog and Bachelor Auction, a charity event for the local animal shelter. For more money than Linnette could believe, her mother had set her up with Cal Washburn and at the same time purchased an Australian shepherd for her brother, Mack. Both gifts had worked out exceptionally well. Lucky had become her brother\u2019s constant companion, and Linnette\u2014well, she\u2019d fallen in love with Cal. That wasn\u2019t how she\u2019d felt about him in the beginning, however.</p><p>All she\u2019d known about Cal Washburn was that he was a horse trainer and that he talked with a mild stutter. Besides, she\u2019d had her sights set on Dr. Chad Timmons. Chad, however, wasn\u2019t interested, despite Linnette\u2019s continued attempts to attract him.</p><p>Her mother had pestered her to go out with Cal, and Linnette had finally capitulated. To her surprise, she\u2019d enjoyed herself. When he\u2019d asked her out again and kissed her, Linnette was even more surprised. She hadn\u2019t expected to enjoy his company, much less his kisses.</p> <p>And so their courtship had begun. Courtship was an old-fashioned word and that suited Linnette, because she considered herself an old-fashioned woman. Cal seemed to appreciate that about her. Their relationship moved slowly\u2014which, she had to admit, she was starting to find a tiny bit frustrating\u2014but she recognized that this was the kind of people they were. Cal\u2019s stutter made him rather shy, even with her.</p><p>Cal was waiting for her when Linnette pulled onto Cliff Harding\u2019s horse ranch in Olalla, about twenty minutes south of Cedar Cove. His welcoming smile made her smile, too. Linnette was thrilled by their feelings for each other, but she was also a little intimidated because of the physical attraction between them. In her early twenties she\u2019d been so intent on her medical studies, she\u2019d never really had a serious relationship. Cal was the first.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said, as she climbed out of her car. He was tall and lean, with deep blue eyes. Their color was so intense she was convinced she\u2019d never seen any bluer.</p><p>\u201cH-hi. Hello.\u201d He didn\u2019t need to say any more for her to know he was glad to see her. He didn\u2019t need to speak for her to know how he felt. Almost before she was ready, he slid his arms around her waist and, after checking to be sure no one was watching, he pulled her close and kissed her with a hunger that sent her mind whirling into space.</p><p>When their kiss ended, she leaned her forehead against his chest and dragged in a deep breath. \u201cYou missed me, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I d-did.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCal,\u201d she said. Because his kisses had such a powerful impact on her, she had to clear her throat. \u201cCal,\u201d she said again. \u201cI got your message and packed us a picnic lunch. What did you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-you\u2019ll s-s-see.\u201d He took her by the hand and led her into the barn, where he had two horses saddled and ready to ride.</p><p>Linnette hesitated. \u201cAh...Have I mentioned that I\u2019ve never been on a horse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. D-d-don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am worried,\u201d she protested. \u201cOkay, I have ridden before. I remember it now. When I was five years old, my dad let me ride a pony at the Puyallup Fair. I was terrified and he had to walk around the circle with me.\u201d</p><p>Cal chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019ll be ok-kay. Sheba\u2014\u201d he pointed toward the brown horse \u201c\u2014is an older m-mare. V-very gentle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d The horses Cal had chosen were a whole lot bigger than that pony had been. Although she might be projecting her own fears, the mare seemed to give her the once-over and then snorted as if to say Linnette would regret it the minute she climbed onto her back.</p><p>\u201cPromise,\u201d Cal assured her.</p> <p>She figured Cal had a romantic interlude planned, and her nervousness was about to ruin everything. In an effort to buy time, she returned slowly to her car and retrieved two sack lunches from the passenger seat.</p><p>Cal walked with her and kept his hand on the base of her neck. \u201cD-don\u2019t-t-t be afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid? I\u2019m not afraid,\u201d she lied. She thought she did a good job of it.</p><p>Cal seemed to believe her\u2014or else he was equally good at pretending.</p><p>\u201cSo Sheba\u2019s mine?\u201d she asked as he took the sack lunches out of her hands and stored them in saddlebags on the larger of the two horses.</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d He gestured with his head toward the mare. \u201cL-like I said, Sh-Sh-Sheba\u2019s gentle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGentle is good,\u201d Linnette murmured as she walked around and stood in front of Sheba, allowing the mare to get a good look at her. Sheba nodded her head a couple of times, apparently acknowledging Linnette\u2019s presence. Maybe in Sheba\u2019s view, Cal had vouched for her, Linnette thought whimsically. Tentatively, Linnette raised her hand and petted the mare\u2019s dark muzzle.</p><p>With Cal\u2019s help she mounted. As soon as Linnette was in the saddle, Cal adjusted the stirrups and handed her the reins. She felt very high off the ground\u2014and correspondingly vulnerable. A fall off this horse could cause her serious injury. And yet she didn\u2019t dare let Cal know how frightened she actually was.</p><p>After asking if she was comfortable, to which she nodded in response, Cal mounted the other horse, a chestnut gelding. He led the way out of the huge barn. Without needing any direction from Linnette, Sheba obediently followed Webster, Cal\u2019s horse.</p><p>Although it was barely noon, the sun was out and the day promised to be glorious. Cal had given her some basic instructions, but riding was awkward at first. Linnette bounced and her teeth chattered until she learned to relax. Cal kept their gait slow and easy. When she felt confident enough to raise her head, she stared avidly at him, so handsome in the saddle, so natural. She remembered what she\u2019d heard Cliff say once\u2014he was a born horseman.</p><p>\u201cGloria?\u201d Cal asked in that shorthand way of his.</p><p>He was asking about her sister, the one she\u2019d only recently met. Her parents had fallen in love when they were both in college. Her mother was still a teenager when Gloria had been conceived\u2014and then the romance had fallen apart. Disgraced and afraid, Corrie had moved back home with her family. Several months later, she\u2019d had a baby girl and given her up for adoption. After the birth she\u2019d returned to college. Without knowing about their child, Roy had sought out Corrie and they\u2019d reunited. Only after they were engaged did Corrie tell him she\u2019d had his baby. They\u2019d agreed never to speak of the matter again, and they hadn\u2019t, until Gloria tracked them down.</p><p>Needless to say, it was a shock to discover she had a sister. Linnette had been astounded, overwhelmed, bewildered. At the same time, she was excited. She\u2019d always wanted a sister and, unbeknownst to her, the woman who lived in the same apartment complex and had already become her friend was also her sister. The bond between them had grown steadily stronger.</p><p>\u201cGloria\u2019s fabulous,\u201d Linnette told Cal. \u201cWe went out to dinner on Monday after work. The whole family\u2019s getting together for Easter, and Gloria will be joining us.\u201d This would be a real test for their family, Linnette realized. She knew her parents loved Gloria and welcomed her into the family.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the same, though, and Linnette recognized that, as did Gloria. Her adoptive parents had died in a plane crash and she had virtually no family left. She\u2019d gone in search of her birth family for that very reason. Linnette\u2019s parents, Corrie and Roy, were trying to make up for lost time, trying to fill in the gaps, exchanging information with Gloria about her history and theirs.</p><p>Cal was watching her intently as she spoke.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t that we don\u2019t want her or don\u2019t love her,\u201d Linnette went on to explain. \u201cYou know we do. What we don\u2019t have is a shared past. She had another mother and father who raised, loved and nurtured her, and they\u2019re her true family, her true parents.\u201d Everyone, however\u2014including Gloria\u2014was determined to make an effort. This Easter would be their first holiday as a family.</p><p>The horses trotted in single file now as they entered the woods. Linnette followed Cal on a narrow path, which made conversation difficult. The scent of fir and ocean mist pervaded the morning air.</p><p>It was just as well that they couldn\u2019t continue their conversation, Linnette decided. She had something important to discuss with Cal and had to figure out how best to approach it. She\u2019d been doing a lot of thinking about his stuttering and wanted to tell him about the research she\u2019d done on speech therapy. Yet she also wanted to make sure he understood that she loved him for the man he was.</p><p>After ten minutes or so, they emerged from the forest and onto a shore. Wavelets lapped against a pebble beach; the tide was in and sparkled in the sunlight.</p><p>\u201cOh, my goodness,\u201d Linnette cried, astonished at how secluded this beach was. Mount Rainier, capped with snow, rose off in the distance. Puget Sound spread out before her like an emerald blanket, with Vashon Island so close it seemed she could easily swim over.</p><p>\u201cY-you like it?\u201d Cal asked, his blue eyes clear and alive.</p><p>\u201cI like it very much.\u201d</p><p>Cal slid off his horse and then helped her down. He left both horses to roam while he set a blanket down on the beach and brought out their lunches. Leaning against a large driftwood log, they sat side by side to eat.</p><p>It was perhaps their most romantic date. When they finished their lunch, they stayed where they were, absorbing the beauty of the view. Cal slipped his arm around her and every now and then they\u2019d kiss. His kisses were soft, sweet, his mouth lingering on hers.</p><p>Linnette thought about what she wanted to say and almost lost her nerve. She was reluctant to mention anything that might destroy the tranquility of the moment.</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d she said after several minutes. \u201cSomething I\u2019ve never asked before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cO-k-kay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you had the stutter all your life?\u201d</p><p>As she\u2019d feared, Cal tensed.</p><p>\u201cCal,\u201d she said, scrambling around. She knelt in front of him and cradled his face in her hands. \u201cI have a reason for asking. Please don\u2019t take offense.\u201d</p><p>His eyes delved into hers, as if to gauge how much he could trust her. She didn\u2019t flinch, didn\u2019t back down and held his look with her own, letting her love shine through her eyes.</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d he said. \u201cAll m-my l-life.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She rewarded him with a series of slow kisses. \u201cDid you know that when we\u2019re kissing and touching, you don\u2019t stutter?\u201d</p><p>He frowned briefly. \u201cI don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. When you\u2019re talking to the animals, you don\u2019t, either.\u201d She\u2019d observed this earlier and been struck by it.</p><p>Again he seemed unsure he should believe her.</p> <p>\u201cHave you ever been to a speech therapist?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Resistance narrowed his gaze and he glanced away. \u201cN-n-no.\u201d</p><p>She turned his face back to her so he couldn\u2019t avoid meeting her eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cThere\u2019s an excellent therapist here in Kitsap County.\u201d She\u2019d investigated therapists in the region and checked out their credentials.</p><p>\u201cY-y-you w-w-w-want me to g-go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s entirely up to you,\u201d she told him, ignoring the fact that his stutter had instantly become more pronounced, which seemed to happen as a reaction to stress. The gravel on the beach was cutting into her knees; still, she stayed where she was. \u201cI\u2019m just letting you know there\u2019s help if you want it.\u201d She placed the emphasis on him. This was up to Cal, and whatever he decided was fine with her.</p> <p>When he didn\u2019t respond right away, Linnette sat down beside him once again. Cal draped his arm around her shoulder and brought her against his side. She felt peaceful and calm in his embrace.</p><p>\u201cW-would y-you go with m-me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the first visit, anyway\u2014if that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>Leaning over, Cal kissed the top of her head. \u201cY-you g-got on Sheba.\u201d</p><p>He was telling her that although she was apprehensive about riding, Linnette had climbed into the saddle\u2014and that he was willing to take a risk, too. He would see a therapist about his speech impediment, despite his intense need to protect his own privacy.</p><p>\u201cI owe my mother a big debt of thanks,\u201d Linnette whispered more to herself than to Cal.</p> <p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe paid a lot of money at that auction so I could meet you, and now that I have, I think she got the bargain of the century.\u201d She grinned. \u201cWhat I really mean is that I did.\u201d</p><p>Seven</p><p>As Rachel Pendergast was putting a load of clean clothes in her dryer, the phone rang. She reached it just before the fifth ring, which was when her answering machine always came on.</p><p>She\u2019d been waiting to hear from Nate all day and dove breathlessly for the receiver. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRachel?\u201d</p><p>It was a young girl\u2019s voice, instantly recognizable as that of nine-year-old Jolene Peyton. They\u2019d been good friends for the last four years. Soon after widower Bruce Peyton had brought his young daughter into the salon for a haircut, Jolene had decided she wanted Rachel to be her new mother. At the time, it had created an embarrassing situation.</p><p>Bruce still grieved for his wife, who\u2019d died in a car accident on her way to pick up Jolene from kinder-garten. He\u2019d been adamant about having no interest in any kind of romance\u2014with anyone, Rachel included. She accepted him at his word and over the next few years, as Jolene and Rachel continued to meet, Bruce and Rachel had become friends. They occasionally went out to dinner, mostly to discuss Jolene, since Bruce often sought her advice. Because she\u2019d lost her own mother when she was relatively young, Rachel identified with the child.</p> <p>In other words, there was nothing romantic between her and Bruce. Rachel was seeing Nate Olsen, although the time they actually spent together was limited, since the navy\u2019s demands came first.</p><p>\u201cI need someone to take me shopping,\u201d Jolene said in a small, uncertain voice. \u201cDad said I could buy an Easter dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be happy to go with you,\u201d Rachel assured the youngster.</p><p>\u201cMy dad wants to talk to you, all right?\u201d The little girl\u2019s voice was more cheerful now.</p><p>\u201cRachel,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cWould it be a bother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d The truth was, she could do with something new herself. \u201cI\u2019d love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen can you go?\u201d</p><p>Since Easter was the following weekend, Rachel figured it would need to be soon. \u201cHow about this afternoon?\u201d she suggested. She had a rare Saturday free, which she\u2019d arranged on the off-chance that Nate would be available. But it was already midafternoon and she hadn\u2019t heard from him, so she assumed he wouldn\u2019t be calling.</p><p>\u201cThis afternoon is perfect,\u201d Bruce said.</p><p>Rachel heard Jolene shout with glee in the background.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring her by in an hour if that works for you,\u201d Bruce said.</p><p>\u201cThat would be great.\u201d</p><p>They discussed a price range for the new outfit and after a few words of farewell, ended the call. Rachel always enjoyed her \u201cgirl-time\u201d with Jolene. When she\u2019d started fourth grade, Jolene had asked her to attend the school\u2019s open house, and with Bruce\u2019s blessing, Rachel had gone. Afterward Jolene had written her a lovely thank-you note, which Rachel treasured. She had a stack of artwork that Jolene had colored or drawn or constructed for her. These were things a little girl would normally give her mother, and Rachel felt honored to play that role\u2014part-time surrogate mom\u2014in Jolene\u2019s life.</p><p>As Rachel finished brushing her hair, her phone rang again. Even before she answered, she had the sinking feeling it would be Nate.</p><p>It was.</p><p>\u201cAre you free?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI will be later,\u201d she told him. Nate was working on some major project aboard the aircraft carrier. Because of it, they hadn\u2019t been together in more than a week.</p><p>\u201cI thought you took the day off,\u201d he complained.</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d She didn\u2019t mention how many favors she\u2019d had to call in to arrange a free Saturday. \u201cWhen I didn\u2019t hear from you, I figured you were still hung up on this project.\u201d</p><p>Nate groaned. \u201cCan you cancel whatever you\u2019ve got planned?\u201d</p><p>Rachel refused to do that to Jolene. \u201cNo. It\u2019s Jolene. I\u2019m taking her shopping for an Easter dress.\u201d</p><p>The line went silent. \u201cAll right,\u201d he said reluctantly, his disappointment obvious. \u201cI would\u2019ve phoned sooner if I\u2019d had the chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Rachel was disappointed, too. \u201cWhat about later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t know that until she got to the shopping mall. \u201cSay six?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too late,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI have a commitment this evening\u2014a stag I have to go to. Dinner and, uh, entertainment. The whole deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...we\u2019ll get together soon,\u201d she assured him. It was the best she could offer.</p><p>\u201cSoon,\u201d Nate agreed with a sigh.</p><p>They spoke until the doorbell rang. Assuming it was Bruce and Jolene, Rachel ended the conversation with Nate and opened the door to discover Teri Miller waiting there. \u201cTurn on your television,\u201d Teri insisted, storming into the small rental house.</p><p>\u201cMy television?\u201d Rachel said. \u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember when we were over at Maryellen\u2019s last week?\u201d Teri moved toward the television and reached for the remote. Not giving Rachel a chance to respond, she turned on the set and flipped though channels until she found the one she wanted.</p><p>Rachel stared at the screen, unable to figure out the program, which seemed to be some sort of...sporting event? She quickly surmised that it had nothing to do with sports. A group of mostly men were gathered around game boards, and everyone seemed intent and deadly serious.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re playing chess,\u201d Rachel said. She couldn\u2019t imagine why this was important to her friend.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s one of the biggest chess tournaments in the world, and they\u2019re in Seattle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeattle,\u201d Rachel repeated. \u201cRight. I remember. We heard the announcement at Maryellen\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBobby Polgar is playing,\u201d Teri said excitedly, standing transfixed in front of the television. She pointed at a man bent over the board just as the camera closed in on the slouching figure.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d The name was vaguely familiar but Rachel didn\u2019t care about chess. She knew the basics of the game, or had at one time, but that was it.</p><p>\u201cBobby Polgar is the top-ranked player in the United States,\u201d Teri explained. Again Rachel wondered why this mattered to her friend. \u201cHe\u2019s in a match with some guy whose name I can\u2019t pronounce. From Ukraine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this interests you?\u201d Rachel asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. At least, Bobby does. I think he\u2019s kind of cute.\u201d She shrugged dramatically. \u201cI know why Bobby\u2019s losing this match.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d She sent Teri a puzzled frown. \u201cI don\u2019t get this, so give me a hand here,\u201d Rachel said. \u201cAs I recall, you know next to nothing about chess.\u201d She remembered that Teri thought chess was a lot like checkers, which of course, it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea how to play,\u201d Teri said. She glanced at her watch and immediately became agitated. \u201cBut that\u2019s beside the point. Listen, I\u2019ve got a ferry to catch. I\u2019m going to Seattle to help Bobby.\u201d</p><p>Rachel stared at her. Life-of-the-party Teri was going to \u201chelp\u201d a chess grand master? Someone she\u2019d only seen on television? Someone who was expert at a game she didn\u2019t know the first thing about? \u201cTeri, are you all right?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cOf course I\u2019m all right. This is a mission of mercy. By the way, can I borrow twenty bucks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get my purse.\u201d They often helped each other out when one was short of cash. Rachel retrieved her wallet and took out the money. This was so unlike Teri. She knew her friend to be impetuous, but this was extreme.</p><p>\u201cI realize you just have a few minutes, but start at the beginning. Just talk fast.\u201d</p><p>Teri drew in a deep breath and spoke in a rush. \u201cI was cutting that snooty college professor\u2019s hair this morning. That Dr. Uptight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Upright,\u201d Rachel corrected.</p><p>\u201cWhatever. The point is, the entire time I was cutting her hair she was on her cell phone getting updates on the chess championship. She couldn\u2019t believe Bobby Polgar was behind. I was curious, so after I finished her haircut, I turned on the TV at the salon and I saw him playing his first match, the one he lost.\u201d Teri said all this apparently without taking a breath.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Rachel urged.</p><p>\u201cAnd he needs a haircut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBobby Polgar needs a haircut?\u201d What did that have to do with anything?</p><p>\u201cYes, he does,\u201d Teri said. \u201cHe kept brushing his hair out of his eyes. His hair is distracting him. He\u2019s long overdue for a cut and I decided to do something about it. I\u2019m going to the tournament and I\u2019m going to offer to cut his hair.\u201d</p><p>Rachel could list at least a dozen obstacles her friend was likely to encounter before she got to Bobby Polgar, if she ever did. However, Teri wasn\u2019t easily dissuaded once she\u2019d made up her mind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing this for my country,\u201d she announced with melodramatic flair. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood for you.\u201d Grinning, Rachel patted her on the shoulder. \u201cLet me know what happens, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Teri promised, practically running out the door to her car.</p><p>No sooner had Teri left than Bruce and Jolene arrived. Rachel was still waving Teri off when the nine-year-old dashed up the sidewalk toward her, hugging Rachel around the waist. Bruce followed at a much slower pace. \u201cWhat time should I pick her up?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drop her off at home,\u201d Rachel told him. He didn\u2019t live far out of her way and it wasn\u2019t as if she had other plans.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a better idea,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I meet you somewhere and the three of us can have dinner together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we, Rachel?\u201d Jolene asked, pigtails bouncing as she leaped up and down. \u201cCan we? Can we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like fun.\u201d</p><p>Three hours later, Rachel and Jolene pulled into the parking lot at the Pancake Palace, where they\u2019d agreed to meet for dinner. The food was cheap and plentiful, and this was Jolene\u2019s favorite place in Cedar Cove to dine. She liked to dip her French fries in her cream-topped hot chocolate, a culinary activity that made Rachel wince.</p><p>Bruce was waiting for them in a booth near the front. The moment they walked in the door, he gestured to them. Jolene ran to his side as if it\u2019d been weeks since she\u2019d last seen her father. Rachel joined them a few seconds later.</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d Bruce asked, sliding over so his daughter could slip in beside him.</p><p>Rachel hid a smile when Jolene chose to sit beside her, instead.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, we had so much fun. Shopping is great! We bought me a pink dress on sale, so we had money left over for tights and a purse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen don\u2019t generally appreciate fifty-percent-off sales unless it involves hardware,\u201d Rachel told the little girl. She reached for the menu and scanned it, deciding on a ham-and-cheese omelet.</p><p>The waitress came for their order and disappeared with quiet efficiency. Jolene chattered for a while, then selected a crayon from the juice glass filled with them and started to color the paper place mat, which had a connect-the-dots outline of a bunny.</p><p>Rachel and Bruce picked up the conversation. They always seemed to have plenty to talk about, although she saw Bruce infrequently. Over the years they\u2019d become comfortable with each other. They\u2019d shared a kiss now and then, but they had no romantic illusions. In any case, Bruce still loved his wife, and Rachel was seeing Nate. In fact, Bruce was someone she\u2019d confided in when she\u2019d first learned Nate\u2019s father was a U.S. congressman.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you ever had a free Saturday night,\u201d Bruce said in an offhand way. \u201cDon\u2019t you and Nate usually go out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish. The navy comes first, and he\u2019s working on some hush-hush project that\u2019s kept him tied up for a few weeks now.\u201d She didn\u2019t point out that although they did manage to talk every day, it was almost always late at night when they were both exhausted.</p><p>She and Bruce lingered over coffee, while Jolene had a second hot chocolate. It was after eight by the time Rachel returned home. She\u2019d enjoyed dinner as much as she had the shopping\u2014which had netted her two new sweaters. Afterward, they\u2019d all gone down to the Cedar Cove waterfront for a walk and an ice-cream cone. She\u2019d described her odd meeting with Teri, and Bruce had laughed.</p><p>\u201cIf anyone can get past security to see Bobby Polgar, it\u2019ll be Teri,\u201d Bruce said.</p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know so.\u201d Bruce nodded confidently. \u201cShe isn\u2019t one to let a little thing like security guards or TV cameras stop her.\u201d</p><p>Rachel suspected he was right. If anyone could talk her way into meeting the top-ranked American chess champion, it\u2019d be Teri.</p><p>She\u2019d just unlocked her front door when the phone rang. Running to answer it, she threw down her shopping bags. As she\u2019d hoped, it was Nate.</p> <p>He told her he was calling from the stag, and she could hear shouts and laughter in the background. He didn\u2019t seem to be enjoying himself.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you?\u201d he demanded, sounding tired and argumentative.</p><p>\u201cI told you I took Jolene shopping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil after eight? You said you\u2019d be back by six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but...\u201d But he hadn\u2019t suggested anything after that, since he\u2019d had his own plans. \u201cWe finished up around six and then met Bruce for dinner at the Pancake Palace.\u201d</p><p>Nate went quiet for a long moment. \u201cYou didn\u2019t say anything about you and Brucie having dinner,\u201d he muttered sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cWell, no,\u201d she agreed, \u201cthat didn\u2019t come up until later. Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he stated matter-of-factly, \u201cI am. I haven\u2019t seen you all week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, and I\u2019ve missed you like crazy. This dinner thing didn\u2019t mean anything, Nate. You know that. It was Bruce\u2019s way of thanking me for taking Jolene shopping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said in a grudging voice.</p><p>\u201cDinner meant nothing, I promise you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said again. \u201cLook, I\u2019ve got tomorrow afternoon free. Do you think you could squeeze me into your busy social calendar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>They arranged to meet at the waterfront, and after a protracted good-night, Rachel replaced the receiver. She took a long shower, then got into an old flannel nightgown and sat in front of the television, hoping the ten o\u2019clock news would have a story on the chess tournament. She half expected to see an item about a disruption, with Teri being hauled away by armed guards.</p><p>As the news began, her mind wandered back to the dinner with Bruce. She felt that their relationship had subtly changed in the last few months. She wasn\u2019t sure how it\u2019d happened or what it meant. She hadn\u2019t lied or misled Nate; dinner tonight wasn\u2019t a romantic tryst. Far from it. Yet something seemed different. Rachel could only wonder why that was.</p><p>When the news anchor spoke about the chess championship, she mentioned only a few of the details\u2014the most prominent being that after his stunning first-match defeat, Bobby Polgar had taken the second match and then the third, winning the championship.</p><p>Eight</p><p>After pacing the hallway outside the sheriff\u2019s office, Seth Gunderson sat restlessly on a nearby bench. Apparently Troy Davis had some news about the fire. Even after nearly a month, Seth had trouble adjusting to the reality of his and Justine\u2019s loss. It felt as if he were in the middle of Leif\u2019s toy kaleidoscope, the pieces of his life tossed about willy-nilly, forming random patterns that made no sense to him.</p><p>Despite his best efforts, Seth discovered himself lashing out at those around him. He felt guilty about the way he\u2019d behaved and was thankful for Justine\u2019s patience, although they\u2019d had a spat just that morning.</p><p>Her comment a couple of weeks earlier that she might not want to rebuild had come as a shock. In his opinion, she wasn\u2019t thinking clearly. He refused to let some unknown arsonist make his decisions for him. And the more his wife tried to convince him to consider options other than rebuilding, the more he shut her out. One thing was certain: Seth couldn\u2019t sit around the house like this much longer. He was going stir-crazy, with nothing to do but fret and fume. Since Justine\u2019s announcement, he hadn\u2019t even found any pleasure in considering new designs for the restaurant.</p><p>The office door opened, and Troy stepped into the hallway. \u201cSorry to keep you waiting,\u201d the sheriff said, extending his hand.</p><p>Seth stood and the two exchanged handshakes. Troy gestured toward his office, then went back inside and sat at his desk. Seth took the chair across from him.</p><p>\u201cI was on the phone with the fire marshal when you arrived,\u201d Troy explained.</p><p>Anxious to hear the latest update, Seth leaned forward. \u201cSo what\u2019s the news?\u201d</p><p>Troy tipped his chair back and locked his fingers behind his head. \u201cThere\u2019s one detail that might be significant, but I\u2019ll get to that later. The inspector hired by the insurance company confirmed what we already knew\u2014that the fire was purposely set. An accelerant was used, probably gasoline. It started near the kitchen, then spread to your office and quickly engulfed the main dining room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuspects?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you know, I\u2019ve interviewed the employees,\u201d Troy told him, dropping his arms and picking up a folder on his desk. \u201cPlus former employees,\u201d he added.</p><p>Seth frowned. \u201cTony Philpott?\u201d</p><p>Davis nodded slowly. \u201cHe\u2019d recently been laid off, correct?\u201d</p><p>Seth pressed his hands against the side of his chair. \u201cI was forced to lay off both Tony and Anson Butler because of the money missing from my office. Both had access and opportunity. Between you and me, I think Tony was the one who took it, but I can\u2019t be sure. We never found it, and I don\u2019t have any proof. It was an unfortunate situation, and I probably didn\u2019t handle it as well as I should have.\u201d</p><p>Seth wished now that he\u2019d dealt with the whole mess some other way. In retrospect he could understand Anson\u2019s anger. Yet he did have a bad track record and despite the boy\u2019s attempt to prove himself, Seth wasn\u2019t entirely satisfied that he could trust him.</p><p>\u201cPhilpott was out of town at the time of the arson,\u201d Troy said. \u201cHis alibi checks out.\u201d</p><p>Seth released a sigh. He didn\u2019t want to think Anson had anything to do with the fire, and yet what else was he to believe? The boy was already responsible for one arson in town, and The Lighthouse had gone up in flames right after he was laid off. All the pieces seemed to fall together, and for once the pattern made a horrible kind of sense.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever seen this?\u201d Troy surprised him by asking. \u201cIt\u2019s what I was referring to earlier.\u201d He held out a photograph of a large pewter cross, then passed it to Seth.</p><p>Seth studied the photo and shook his head. He couldn\u2019t remember seeing it before, but that wasn\u2019t saying much. He never paid much attention to jewelry.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you find it?\u201d The cross looked partially melted, so it must have been either in the fire or close to it.</p><p>\u201cThe fire inspectors came across it in the rubble, near the office. It might mean nothing, but then again...\u201d He shrugged. \u201cAt this point we just don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll keep you updated on anything we learn.\u201d</p><p>Seth stood up. \u201cThank you, Sheriff. I appreciate everything you\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>On his way out of the office, Seth checked his watch. Ten. The entire day stretched before him, about as empty as a discarded beer bottle. This past month was the first time since he\u2019d bought the old Captain\u2019s Galley restaurant and remodeled it that he\u2019d had nothing to do.</p><p>Before this, there weren\u2019t enough hours in a day. His schedule was full; he\u2019d constantly had meetings and plans and new ideas. His lack of purpose was killing him. Of course, he could go back home, but his relationship with Justine was strained. He loved his wife, but he didn\u2019t understand her anymore. Right now, he needed breathing room, a place where he could collect his thoughts, try to figure out what came next. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Seth had always done his best thinking on the water and it seemed natural to go down to the marina. He kept his sailboat moored there but couldn\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d taken her out. The air was crisp and clean, and he breathed deeply as he strolled over to the waterfront. Sailboats and motorboats of various sizes were secured in their slips, bobbing gently, peacefully, in the dark-green waters.</p><p>\u201cSeth.\u201d</p><p>At the sound of his name, he turned to see his father walking toward him. Seth smiled. He\u2019d always been close to his family. He and his father had once been partners in a fishing enterprise, which took them to Alaska for a number of months each year. The money was good, but the work was dangerous, and when Justine came into his life, Seth knew it was time to make a career change. His father\u2019s help had been instrumental in starting the restaurant.</p><p>\u201cYou spoke with the sheriff?\u201d Leif Gunderson asked when he joined him.</p> <p>Seth nodded. He hadn\u2019t mentioned this to his father, which meant Leif had been talking to Justine. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing new to report about how the fire was set\u2014we already know that\u2014or by whom. The inspector found a pewter cross in the ashes. That\u2019s the biggest news. But I have no idea who it belongs to and we can\u2019t be sure it\u2019s even connected to the arsonist.\u201d</p><p>Leif frowned, as if pondering this latest bit of information. They sat on a park bench outside the marina. \u201cHow are things at home?\u201d his father asked.</p><p>Seth figured his wife had given him an earful. Then again, it wasn\u2019t like Justine to share their personal problems with others. \u201cWhat makes you ask?\u201d Seth murmured. He reached down and picked up a pebble and threw it into the water.</p><p>His father picked one up, too, and tossed it toward the cove. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to pry. It\u2019s just that you looked like you wanted to talk.\u201d</p><p>All at once Seth realized he did need to confide in someone. Someone who knew him well, yet could maintain a perspective on the whole situation and everyone involved. Someone whose advice he trusted. Who else but his father? Sighing deeply, Seth braced his elbows on his knees. \u201cJustine and I had an argument this morning. It wasn\u2019t over anything important. We\u2019re both on edge these days with the fire and all.\u201d</p> <p>His father didn\u2019t respond for a moment. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe problem is, I don\u2019t know what to do with myself these days. I wanted to start rebuilding as soon as possible. Then, a couple of weeks ago, Justine dropped this bombshell about not being sure rebuilding was such a good idea. She seems to believe we should just forget about the restaurant.\u201d Seth lowered his voice.</p><p>He sucked in his breath and waited for his father\u2019s reaction. He assumed Leif would react the same way he had\u2014with shock and disbelief. The fact that he didn\u2019t immediately say anything surprised him. \u201cSo, what do you think?\u201d Seth pressed.</p><p>His father leaned back, closing his eyes. \u201cDid she give you a reason?\u201d</p><p>Seth had been too shocked to take in much of what Justine had said. At the time, he\u2019d figured it was simply her way of dealing with the aftermath of the fire. \u201cMy wife is talking nonsense,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need the restaurant. It\u2019s how we make our living. Okay, she\u2019s right\u2014I do put in a lot of hours and the work is demanding. The profit margin isn\u2019t exactly what we\u2019d hoped, but we were doing pretty well.\u201d</p><p>He looked at his father, but Leif still didn\u2019t give any indication of what he was thinking.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s total nonsense,\u201d Seth insisted a second time. \u201cOf course we should rebuild!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you plan to do while you\u2019re waiting for everything to come together?\u201d his father asked instead.</p><p>If Seth had the answer to that, he wouldn\u2019t be hanging around the marina. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d This gave the matter of rebuilding top priority in his mind. Filling his days with the reconstruction project would ease his depression. Seth had been raised with a strong work ethic; he\u2019d worked summers and after school from the time he was thirteen. He didn\u2019t know what to do with himself when he wasn\u2019t working. Outside of his role as a husband and father, his identity, his sense of who he was, came from what he did. Without work, he had no purpose.</p><p>Leif quirked a brow in his direction. \u201cDo you love Justine?\u201d</p><p>That question came as another shock. \u201cMore than my life.\u201d Seth had loved her when they were in high school and he\u2019d carried a torch for her years afterward, too. She\u2019d gone off to college and he\u2019d half expected her to marry some rich boy there. But she\u2019d returned to Cedar Cove, starting work at the bank. He\u2019d never believed she would love him, didn\u2019t even think it was a possibility.</p><p>\u201cYou might listen to her, then,\u201d his father advised.</p><p>\u201cI do listen, but she\u2019s talking foolishness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might be listening, but you\u2019re not hearing her.\u201d</p> <p>At that, Seth turned to stare at his father. \u201cYou\u2019re saying I should let all those years of work go down the drain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m saying you need to listen to your wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat am I supposed to do?\u201d Seth flared. Everyone seemed to have an opinion but no one had offered him a solution.</p><p>His father didn\u2019t answer. A moment later, he casually continued the conversation. \u201cI was talking to Larry Boone the other day,\u201d Leif said as he tossed another pebble in the water. \u201cYou remember Larry, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Seth nodded. His father had purchased a fishing boat from the other man. Seth had owned a half interest in the boat and when they sold it, they\u2019d invested that money in the restaurant.</p><p>\u201cLarry\u2019s looking for a salesman and asked if I\u2019d be interested in coming out of retirement. The way he figured it, I\u2019d been around fishing and boats all my life. He\u2019s selling pleasure crafts, too, and offered me a commission that sounded almost too good to be true.\u201d</p><p>Seth thought his father was probably glad of an excuse to go back to work. Adjusting to retirement hadn\u2019t been as easy as he\u2019d assumed it would be. \u201cAre you going to do it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI considered it,\u201d his father said, grinning. \u201cBut then I talked to your mother, and she was dead set against it.\u201d Leif rubbed the side of his face. \u201cShe\u2019s been waiting all these years for us to travel. She\u2019s got her heart set on buying one of those RVs and driving across the country. She isn\u2019t about to let me take up a second career at this stage.\u201d</p><p>Seth chuckled, understanding his father\u2019s advice. \u201cSo that\u2019s the reason you\u2019re telling me I need to listen to my wife. You\u2019re listening to yours.\u201d</p><p>His father chuckled, too. \u201cYou know your mother. When she wants something, she makes sure I hear about it.\u201d</p><p>Seth did know and love his mother, and he had to agree she generally found ways of getting what she wanted. He loved the give and take of his parents\u2019 marriage, and their ability to compromise.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t much like the idea of driving one of those battleships,\u201d Leif admitted, \u201cbut I\u2019ll do it, and by the time we get back, my guess is I\u2019ll be able to park that thing as slick as any boat I ever steered.\u201d</p><p>Seth didn\u2019t doubt it for an instant.</p><p>\u201cI phoned Larry this morning,\u201d he went on, \u201cand told him I had to refuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas he disappointed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was,\u201d Leif said, \u201cso I gave him your number and suggested he call you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Seth asked. \u201cYou think I can sell boats?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? You know as much about fishing as I do, and what you don\u2019t know about pleasure crafts you can learn. The money\u2019s good, and it\u2019ll help you fill in the time until you decide about the restaurant.\u201d</p><p>Seth needed to talk to Justine. This idea suddenly seemed right to him, but he wanted a few days to mull it over.</p><p>He sat with his father a while longer, chatting companionably about friends and neighbors, then headed home. Justine was vacuuming when Seth walked in and didn\u2019t hear him. He stopped to admire her as she worked. Her long hair flowed unrestrained down her back and her lithe body moved gracefully as she pushed the vacuum cleaner. Justine\u2019s concentration on any task was always complete; it was one of the many traits he loved.</p><p>He regretted their argument and was sorry for the things he\u2019d said.</p><p>When she turned and saw him standing just inside the door, she jumped, startled. \u201cSeth!\u201d She switched off the vacuum cleaner. \u201cWhen did you get home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust now.\u201d He walked toward her. \u201cWhere\u2019s Leif?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPreschool. I need to pick him up in half an hour.\u201d Her gaze didn\u2019t meet his as she swept the hair away from her face. \u201cDid the sheriff have any news?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cHe showed me a picture of a pewter cross. You might take a look and see if you recognize it, although there\u2019s no guarantee it\u2019s connected to the arsonist.\u201d He paused. \u201cIf the sheriff doesn\u2019t get any leads from that, I feel we should contact Roy McAfee.\u201d</p><p>Justine didn\u2019t respond to any of those statements. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about this morning,\u201d she murmured instead.</p><p>\u201cI am, too.\u201d He walked toward her, and she stepped into his embrace. \u201cWe need to talk,\u201d he said, holding her close.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about if I take you and Leif out for lunch,\u201d he said. \u201cI ran into Dad, and he had a suggestion I want to discuss with you.\u201d He went on holding her. For the first time, he saw clearly that his anger was putting their marriage at risk. He loved Justine and his son. Dammit! He wasn\u2019t going to lose them, too.</p><p>Nine</p><p>Olivia Lockhart-Griffin wondered if job shadowing was such a good idea. The high-school guidance office had contacted her a couple of weeks earlier to make the arrangements, and in a moment of weakness she\u2019d agreed. The high-school girl sitting in front of her looked terribly young, but her eyes glowed with sincerity and keen interest. Olivia had believed in the justice system as a girl of that age, and she did now. The difference was that years of experience had shown her its weaknesses as well as its strengths.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019d like to be an attorney?\u201d Olivia glanced down at the girl\u2019s name on the sheet of paper. \u201cAllison?\u201d she added. Allison Cox. Cox. That name sounded vaguely familiar.</p><p>\u201cYes, Judge, I would,\u201d Allison said, her back straight.</p><p>\u201cAny particular reason?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>The girl nervously flipped a strand of dark hair over her ear. \u201cI\u2019m hoping to learn how to use the law to help someone who doesn\u2019t have a lot of options.\u201d</p><p>Olivia nodded. It sounded as if the girl had a personal agenda; however, there wasn\u2019t time to delve into that now. She needed to get to court. \u201cI\u2019ll be spending the morning in court, listening to a variety of cases. You can sit in the jury box near the court reporter. We\u2019ll take a short break midmorning, and then stop for lunch around noon. I have a luncheon engagement with my mother. You\u2019re welcome to join us if you\u2019d like, and then we\u2019ll return to court about one-thirty.\u201d She smiled at the girl, who nodded. \u201cDepending on the cases, I generally stop for the day at four. I stay a bit longer to read case files for the next day, but you\u2019ll be free to go then.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Allison made a notation on a yellow pad. \u201cThank you for giving me this opportunity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Is there anything you\u2019d like to ask me before we head into the courtroom?\u201d</p><p>The girl offered her a tentative smile. \u201cI...I asked the guidance counselor if I could be assigned to you specifically. You might not remember this, but about three years ago my parents were in your court. They were getting a divorce.\u201d</p><p>That was why the name seemed familiar. Olivia did recall the couple and their situation.</p> <p>\u201cMom and Dad had decided on joint custody of my brother and me. You said you didn\u2019t like Eddie and me moving between houses every few days, so you gave us the house and had Mom and Dad move in and out.\u201d</p><p>Olivia smiled. \u201cI remember. But professional ethics prevents me from discussing any case if there\u2019s a possibility the parties might come before me again.\u201d</p><p>Allison nodded. \u201cThey remarried, you know.\u201d</p><p>Olivia didn\u2019t, and was pleased to hear it. \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful.\u201d Checking her watch, she stood and reached for her black robe. Pulling it on, she left her chambers. Allison followed and she introduced the girl to the court reporter, who escorted her to a seat near the bench.</p><p>The court cases on that morning\u2019s schedule probably opened Allison\u2019s eyes wider than anything she\u2019d read or seen on television. The child custody cases always tore at Olivia\u2019s heart. The state\u2019s position was to leave the child with the primary residential parent, in most cases the mother, if at all possible, as long as the child\u2019s welfare wasn\u2019t in jeopardy. More times than she cared to admit, Olivia wanted to shake these young parents and ask them to take a hard look at what they were doing to themselves and their children. Too often, their minds were addled by drugs or alcohol. Sadly, she doubted anything she said would sink in. Of course she dealt with other cases, too, but these were the ones that stood out most prominently.</p> <p>Olivia noticed Allison taking copious notes and could only imagine what the high-school senior must be thinking, looking at the ravaged lives of those who stood before her.</p><p>Shortly after court went into session, Charlotte Jefferson-Rhodes slipped onto a bench at the back of the courtroom. Within about a minute, she\u2019d taken out her knitting. Olivia smiled. Charlotte was an inveterate knitter. More than that, she was exceptional in every way, and Olivia\u2019s admiration for her continued to grow.</p><p>Case in point, her mother and friends were responsible for the new medical clinic in town. It\u2019d taken a senior citizens\u2019 demonstration and an arrest to get the council to respond. Word of Charlotte\u2019s arrest had spread faster than chicken pox through their small community. Not long afterward, the council had made some major concessions that allowed the establishment of a medical facility in town.</p><p>The irony of it was that this same medical center had saved Jack\u2019s life. Olivia\u2019s husband had suffered a heart attack the year before, and the EMTs had told her that if they\u2019d had to drive him all the way to Bremerton, Jack wouldn\u2019t have survived.</p><p>At the time of the demonstration, Olivia had been embarrassed by her mother. Now she\u2019d be forever grateful that there was a medical clinic in Cedar Cove, and it was mostly due to Charlotte, her second husband, Ben, and their friends.</p><p>Olivia was accustomed to seeing her mother in court, although she didn\u2019t come by as often as she used to. Since Ben Rhodes had entered her life, Charlotte had better things to do than sit and listen to Olivia.</p> <p>At noon, the court broke for lunch. Allison and Charlotte met Olivia in her chambers, and Olivia made the introductions.</p><p>\u201cWould you care to join us?\u201d Olivia asked the teenager. She didn\u2019t expect the girl to accept, and she was right. They agreed to meet again at one-thirty.</p><p>\u201cWhat a lovely young lady,\u201d Charlotte commented after Allison had excused herself.</p><p>\u201cShe is,\u201d Olivia agreed. \u201cWhere would you like to have lunch?\u201d Her favorite place had always been The Lighthouse. Olivia missed it even more than she would\u2019ve thought.</p><p>\u201cHow about the Wok and Roll,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cGrace tells me Maryellen likes their chicken hot sauce noodles, and I have a hankering to try that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good to me.\u201d Olivia was just grateful her mother didn\u2019t suggest The Taco Shack, which happened to be Jack\u2019s favorite. She\u2019d had about all the tacos and enchiladas she could stand for a while.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of Grace, have you seen her lately?\u201d Charlotte asked as they walked through the courthouse and to the parking lot behind.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s so busy, we haven\u2019t talked all week. She\u2019s had to temporarily give up her Wednesday night aerobics class.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy goodness, you two have been going to that class for years,\u201d Charlotte exclaimed. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening? Is Cliff keeping her all to himself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Using her remote, Olivia unlocked the car doors and opened the passenger side for her mother. \u201cNothing like that. She\u2019s helping Jon and Maryellen as much as she can. Kelly\u2019s pregnant, too, you know.\u201d Olivia slid into the driver\u2019s seat. \u201cGrace rented out the house on Rosewood Lane and you won\u2019t believe who her tenants are. The Randalls! Do you remember them?\u201d At her mother\u2019s blank expression, Olivia elaborated. \u201cYou were in court the day I denied their divorce. A young navy couple. Apparently they have a baby now and were looking for a house to rent and Grace met them. She remembered the case. Then, while she was talking to Mrs. Randall, my name came up. That\u2019s when Grace learned this was the very same couple. It\u2019s a small world, isn\u2019t it? Grace wanted me to know how well everything worked out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good news. And how\u2019s Maryellen?\u201d Charlotte asked, concerned about Grace\u2019s oldest daughter.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s doing well, especially now that Jon\u2019s parents have arrived. They showed up last week and Grace told me it\u2019s made a world of difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere has Jon\u2019s family been all this time?\u201d Charlotte asked. \u201cWell, never mind, they\u2019re here now, and I know Maryellen and Jon must be thankful for the help. Some babies have a few problems coming into this world. That\u2019s why God created grandparents.\u201d</p><p>Olivia smiled at her mother as she pulled out of the parking lot and headed down Harbor Street toward the Chinese restaurant.</p><p>\u201cAnd Jack? How\u2019s he? I do hope he isn\u2019t working himself into another heart attack,\u201d Charlotte said next.</p><p>At the mention of her husband, Olivia had to smile. \u201cHe\u2019s as cantankerous as ever. He\u2019s also back at work full-time.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte\u2019s eyebrows shot up. \u201cI thought you weren\u2019t going to let that happen.\u201d</p><p>As if Olivia had any real control over Jack. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stop him. He has an assistant editor now, and he\u2019s home every night as close to five as he can manage. He\u2019s lost thirty pounds, but I swear it was like chiseling it off an ounce at a time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he might\u2019ve cheated now and then,\u201d Charlotte whispered.</p><p>That was an understatement if ever there was one. Jack did cheat\u2014but not as often anymore. The heart attack had frightened him off double cheeseburgers for life, thankfully. Still, there was the occasional bowl of ice cream and a few cookies, but overall, Jack\u2019s self-control had been impressive.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you and Ben?\u201d Olivia asked as they drove into the parking lot at the Wok and Roll.</p><p>\u201cI have news about David, Ben\u2019s son,\u201d Charlotte said as she climbed out of the car. \u201cYou remember him, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Olivia wasn\u2019t likely to forget David Rhodes. Ben\u2019s youngest son had asked her to fix a reckless driving ticket he\u2019d gotten while visiting Cedar Cove. He hadn\u2019t taken kindly to her refusal.</p><p>The conversation was halted by their arrival at the restaurant. Once they were seated and sipping tea they resumed talking. Their order for chicken hot sauce noodles was already in the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cYou mentioned David Rhodes,\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d Charlotte reached for her purse and took out a linen hankie, dabbing at the corner of her mouth. \u201cSad to say, Ben\u2019s son is an embarrassment to him. He felt sick at heart when he learned David had approached you about the traffic ticket. He was mortified by that.\u201d</p><p>In Olivia\u2019s view that was the least of David\u2019s sins. She wasn\u2019t about to forget or forgive the fact that he\u2019d attempted to swindle her mother out of thousands of dollars. If not for Justine\u2019s quick thinking, he would\u2019ve gotten away with it. After some fast talking on David\u2019s part, her mother had written him a check. They\u2019d met for lunch at The Lighthouse, just the two of them, but Justine had been on the alert. Much to David\u2019s chagrin, she\u2019d swiped it right out of his hand. That was the same afternoon he\u2019d picked up the reckless driving ticket. He probably should\u2019ve been charged with driving under the influence, too, Olivia thought.</p><p>\u201cDavid does have his problems,\u201d Charlotte said, \u201cbut I feel he\u2019s genuinely trying.\u201d</p><p>Olivia would believe that when she saw it.</p><p>\u201cBen got a check from David this week for a thousand dollars toward a loan he received from his father several years ago.\u201d</p><p>This was promising news. Perhaps David Rhodes had learned his lesson. Although Olivia took a rather jaundiced view of that possibility.</p><p>\u201cBen didn\u2019t say much, but I could tell he was pleased.\u201d Charlotte beamed. \u201cIt distresses me to see Ben estranged from his son. I know it bothers him, although he won\u2019t talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid\u2019s a grown man, Mom. He isn\u2019t going to change. He is who he is, and that\u2019s who he\u2019ll remain\u2014unless something drastic happens.\u201d</p><p>Her mother sipped her tea. Then casually, as if discussing the weather, she said, \u201cYour brother\u2019s his own person, too, and he isn\u2019t likely to change, either.\u201d</p><p>A chill went down Olivia\u2019s back. So her mother knew. Will lived in the Atlanta area with his wife. They\u2019d never had children, and while outwardly the marriage appeared stable, Olivia knew there were problems. Problems she suspected were due to her brother\u2019s infidelity. She\u2019d never discussed with her mother what she\u2019d recently learned about Will. How could she? But it seemed Charlotte was well aware of her son\u2019s weaknesses.</p><p>Olivia had been disillusioned by Will. Shortly after Grace discovered that her first husband, Dan, had committed suicide, Will had contacted her. Before long, Grace and Will were involved in an e-mail relationship. Will had misled her friend, lied to Grace and said he was getting divorced. While not completely blameless, Grace had been vulnerable to his undeniable charms and naive about his motives. She\u2019d trusted him\u2014and nearly lost Cliff because of Will\u2019s selfish lies.</p><p>\u201cWill isn\u2019t a good husband,\u201d Charlotte murmured. \u201cIt pains me to say so. Georgia wrote and said she\u2019d had enough. Will was involved with someone at work. Georgia has decided to file for divorce.\u201d</p><p>The fact that he\u2019d had an affair didn\u2019t come as any shock to Olivia. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI called Will and spoke to him,\u201d Charlotte continued. \u201cGeorgia\u2019s moved out, but he seems to think she\u2019ll change her mind. Apparently she has in the past.\u201d</p><p>The waitress came with their order and two bowls. Steam rose from the noodles bathed in their seasoned chili sauce, topped with broccoli and slices of chicken. Although it smelled heavenly, Olivia found her appetite was gone.</p><p>\u201cGeorgia isn\u2019t going to change her mind this time,\u201d Charlotte said calmly. \u201cI spoke to her, too, and heard the determination in her voice. It\u2019s over and frankly, I don\u2019t blame her.\u201d</p><p>Olivia was saddened to learn that her brother had destroyed his marriage. She remained angry with him for what he\u2019d done to Grace. He\u2019d apparently thought Olivia would never learn of his deception but she had, and she\u2019d let him know how upset she was. He\u2019d brushed off her chastisement, with the implication that she was overstepping her bounds. In Will\u2019s opinion, this wasn\u2019t any of her business. But it was, and Olivia refused to forget what Will had done to her best friend.</p> <p>Once they were off the subject of incorrigible sons\u2014David and Will\u2014Charlotte and Olivia made Easter plans. Everyone was coming to Olivia\u2019s for dinner, but Charlotte had planned brunch for Easter morning, following church services. She was baking her cinnamon rolls, which were Jack and Ben\u2019s favorite.</p><p>Charlotte and Olivia chatted about some of Charlotte\u2019s knitting friends as they finished lunch. Then Olivia paid for their meal and they returned to the courthouse.</p><p>Allison Cox met her outside her chambers, waiting as Olivia flipped through her phone messages, something she hadn\u2019t had a chance to do before leaving with her mother. The one on top made her smile. It was from Grace, and it said she\u2019d see her at aerobics class that evening.</p><p>Ten</p><p>Allison was convinced of two things: Anson would be back before graduation and she\u2019d hear from him by Easter. The more she thought about it, the stronger the idea became. Anson would call her by Easter. She knew it. She felt it. She lived on that hope.</p> <p>Her day in court with Judge Lockhart-Griffin had been revealing, to say the least. People did stupid things and seemed shocked when they were held accountable in a court of law.</p><p>Anson wasn\u2019t like the people who stood before the judge. He\u2019d been working hard to do the right thing, and then it seemed everything had blown up in his face. No one believed he was innocent. Yes, he was angry and disillusioned with the Gundersons\u2014understandably because they\u2019d laid him off\u2014but that didn\u2019t mean he\u2019d started the fire.</p><p>She sat on her bed and studied her notes from the day in court. The phone rang in the distance and she left it for Eddie to answer, since he considered it his duty to check all incoming calls. He was okay as brothers went, she supposed, but sometimes he could be a real pest.</p><p>\u201cAllison!\u201d he shouted as if she were deaf. \u201cIt\u2019s for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cSome guy. He didn\u2019t give his name.\u201d</p> <p>Only half interested, Allison reached for the receiver in her room. She paused. \u201cHang up, Eddie.\u201d When she heard the click, she said, \u201cHi,\u201d in an indifferent voice.</p><p>\u201cAllison.\u201d</p><p>Her heart stopped. It was Anson.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d she asked, gripping the phone with both hands.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure what to make of that.</p> <p>\u201cI needed to hear your voice,\u201d he said. \u201cI know what happened at The Lighthouse. Everyone thinks I did it, don\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t lie to him. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond for a moment. \u201cI swear to you, Allison, it wasn\u2019t me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you.\u201d It was hard to speak past the lump in her throat. In her joy at hearing from him, she nearly floated off the bed. \u201cHow did you get past Eddie?\u201d That was a crazy question when so many others were far more important.</p><p>\u201cI had a friend of mine call. I\u2019m using a throwaway cell phone. No one\u2019ll be able to trace it. I don\u2019t want to get you into trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you need anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...just the sound of your voice. I knew if I heard it I\u2019d be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will be, too,\u201d she said breathlessly. She longed to tell him how desperately she missed him and how difficult it was to go to school every day and defend him. Anson didn\u2019t need to hear any of that. His troubles far outweighed hers.</p><p>\u201cHas it been bad for you?\u201d he asked. \u201cDid the sheriff question you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I...told them about you coming to my window that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay\u2014you had to tell the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou...you smelled of smoke. I was too upset to realize it right away.... I\u2014I didn\u2019t say anything to the sheriff.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t comment or explain. Instead, he asked. \u201cIs there a warrant out for my arrest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She lowered her voice on the off-chance Eddie was listening. \u201cBut the sheriff says you\u2019re a...a person of interest.\u201d</p><p>He seemed relieved to hear that. \u201cNo matter what anyone tells you, Allison, I swear I didn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She closed her eyes and held her breath, as if to keep him close. Then she wondered if he had a specific reason for reaching out to her, if he needed her help. \u201cShould I send you some money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>Her heart pounded so hard that her pulse echoed in her ears. The money box had been taken from the office the night of the fire. Allison had heard the sheriff mention it to her father.</p><p>Anson hadn\u2019t been able to save any money because everything he\u2019d earned as a dishwasher and later as a prep cook had gone toward restitution for the fire he\u2019d set in the park. If he left Cedar Cove with money, it hadn\u2019t come from his employment. She wanted to ask what he was living on, but she was afraid of the answer, afraid of the truth.</p><p>\u201cCome back, Anson,\u201d she pleaded softly. \u201cMy dad will help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t,\u201d he returned, \u201cnot this time. I appreciate everything he did, but this is bigger. I\u2019m eighteen now, Allison. This isn\u2019t going to be handled in juvie. I\u2019d be tried as an adult and I can\u2019t risk that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d She didn\u2019t want to beg. \u201cI can\u2019t stand not knowing where you are or what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late, Allison. I\u2019m sorry\u2014sorrier than I can ever tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t too late. It can\u2019t be.\u201d Anson didn\u2019t seem to understand that they\u2019d never be together if he didn\u2019t clear his name.</p><p>\u201cWhere I am,\u201d he began, then stopped abruptly.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she urged.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no going back for me. I shouldn\u2019t have phoned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I\u2019m so glad you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go now.\u201d</p><p>The reluctance in his voice made her feel like crying. She wanted to argue with him, plead with him to talk to her for just a few minutes more. Instinctively she knew it wouldn\u2019t make any difference.</p><p>\u201cWill you call again?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d All her love was in that word.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try. Believe in me, Allison. You\u2019re the only good thing that\u2019s ever happened to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe in you. With all my heart I believe in you\u2014I believe in us.\u201d</p><p>The phone disconnected.</p><p>For a long time, Allison just sat on her bed, holding the receiver. Tears pooled in her eyes but she held them back, unwilling to let them spill over.</p><p>Some time later, she heard the garage door close as her mother came home from work. Rosie Cox was teaching fifth grade this year at one of Cedar Cove\u2019s elementary schools.</p><p>\u201cAllison,\u201d her mother said as she walked past her bedroom door. She knocked once. \u201cWould you mind peeling five potatoes for dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d She tried to sound normal, as though everything in her world was exactly as it should be. Apparently she failed, because her mother opened her bedroom door and glanced in, her face showing signs of worry.</p><p>\u201cEverything all right?\u201d she asked gently.</p><p>Allison shrugged. \u201cSure, why not?\u201d</p><p>Her mother stepped into the room and sat on the edge of the bed. \u201cI remember when you were three years old and you decided you were perfectly capable of pouring your own bowl of cereal.\u201d She smiled as she spoke. \u201cIt was early one Saturday morning and you sat in the middle of the kitchen floor, where you emptied the contents of an entire box into a single bowl. I walked in, and you looked up at me with almost the same how-did-this-happen-to-me expression you have now.\u201d</p><p>Allison had heard that cereal story a dozen times. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d she insisted, and she hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Her mother patted her hand. \u201cDoes this concern Anson in some way?\u201d</p><p>Allison wanted to deny everything, to vent an anger that came from frustration\u2014and fear. Being defensive was how she would\u2019ve responded a few years ago. But she knew that ploy wouldn\u2019t work. Lowering her head, she whispered, \u201cHe phoned.\u201d</p><p>Exactly as Allison had suspected, her mother snapped to attention. \u201cWhen? Just now?\u201d</p><p>Head still bent, Allison nodded.</p><p>\u201cWe have to tell the sheriff,\u201d her mother said. \u201cYou know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d she cried, \u201cwe can\u2019t! Anson swore to me he\u2019s innocent. He told me he didn\u2019t set the fire and I believe him.\u201d</p><p>Her mother slid one arm around Allison\u2019s shoulders. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, we don\u2019t have to worry. We want Sheriff Davis to solve this so Anson can come home, right?\u201d</p><p>Allison wanted that more than anything.</p><p>Her mother called the sheriff, who arrived about the same time her father did. Everyone gathered around the kitchen table, and Sheriff Davis questioned Allison again and again. He reviewed every detail of her brief conversation with Anson. Halfway through, the sheriff\u2019s cell phone rang. He excused himself to answer it, going into the other room, then returning to the kitchen a few minutes later.</p><p>\u201cThe phone is untraceable,\u201d he announced. \u201cWe don\u2019t know where he is.\u201d</p><p>That was what Anson had told her, but she was relieved to hear it, anyway.</p><p>\u201cDo you think he\u2019ll phone again?\u201d Sheriff Davis asked, pinning her with a look.</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know.\u201d But Allison prayed that he would.</p><p>\u201cYou have any idea how he\u2019s living?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he didn\u2019t need any.\u201d</p><p>Her parents exchanged a quick glance, knowing that she\u2019d offered to give him what she had. She tried to defuse the tension, saying, \u201cI asked him to come back, but he said he couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere might be a very good reason for that, Allison,\u201d Sheriff Davis said. \u201cAn innocent man doesn\u2019t need to hide. If he calls you again, you tell him I said that, all right?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Allison met his eyes and nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll tell him,\u201d she promised.</p><p>Eleven</p><p>The day before Easter was always a busy time at Get Nailed. A lot of their clients attended church and wanted to look their best. She knew it was an important religious feast day, but Teri wasn\u2019t much interested in church. It wasn\u2019t how she\u2019d been raised. Her mama was a single mother with three kids, struggling to make ends meet. She could barely keep them fed and clothed, let alone teach them about church. Teri, the eldest, had dropped out of high school at sixteen to attend beauty school and had her license the day she turned eighteen.</p><p>She was good at her job, but it wasn\u2019t the career she really wanted. Teri would\u2019ve liked to spend her time around books. Be a librarian or even work in a bookstore or something like that. She was constantly reading. Her house had stacks of paperbacks in every room\u2014romances and mysteries and biographies. Any title that caught her eye. Most of her extra cash went to books. With her lack of a social life outside the salon, they were great company.</p> <p>Being a stylist suited her well enough, and it paid the bills. Fortunately, she was talented and kept up with current styles; she also had a decent clientele. Her first customer of the day was Justine Gunderson, who came in for a trim.</p><p>\u201cI heard about what you did,\u201d Justine teased her as she sat in Teri\u2019s chair. Word had spread throughout the community. People talked, of course, and she\u2019d been questioned again and again about meeting Bobby Polgar.</p><p>Teri studied Justine\u2019s thick, straight hair, which hung down her back\u2014the kind of hair they had in shampoo advertisements, healthy and shiny. Teri\u2019s own had been dyed, cut and permed so often she\u2019d forgotten the original color. Dishwater blond, she guessed. At the moment it was dyed brown with red highlights, and she wore it ultra-short and spiked with gel. She was thinking of dyeing it black next week when there was a lull in the schedule. She\u2019d see if she could get Jane to do it for her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m impressed,\u201d Justine said. \u201cYou cut Bobby Polgar\u2019s hair.\u201d</p><p>People still talked about how she\u2019d appeared at the televised chess match and bullied her way in to see the world-famous chess player. For pride\u2019s sake, she\u2019d made it seem easy; in truth it\u2019d taken a lot of effort.</p> <p>Her arrival had caused a scene with those unpleasant security people. When they found her scissors, the guards acted as though she was some dangerous lunatic. She\u2019d made such a fuss that Bobby himself had come out to see what she wanted, which was the only reason she\u2019d even had a chance. He\u2019d listened to her assessment that he needed a haircut and agreed to let her do it.</p><p>With several bodyguard types following, she\u2019d been escorted in to Bobby Polgar\u2019s suite. When she entered, all kinds of people were milling about, giving him advice and making suggestions about the next chess match with the Russian. The moment Teri stepped into the fray, Bobby had lifted his hand and the room went silent. He\u2019d stared at her, so she stared back. She\u2019d told him to sit down, draped a towel over his shoulders and retrieved her scissors from one of the security people.</p><p>\u201cLike I said, your hair is what\u2019s distracting you,\u201d Teri had told him. \u201cYou don\u2019t need other people\u2019s advice. You know what you\u2019re doing better than anyone.\u201d In retrospect, it was a bold statement and Teri couldn\u2019t quite understand why she even cared about this man and his silly chess match. All she knew was that she had this compelling urge to go to him and cut his hair. Go figure. She was the impulsive type and...well, it\u2019d worked. Didn\u2019t matter if she couldn\u2019t explain it.</p><p>Most everyone wanted to know what Bobby had said to her. This was the confusing part. A few minutes after she showed up, Bobby had asked everyone else to leave, and then it was just the two of them. She wished she had some fantastic story to tell, but she didn\u2019t. She\u2019d simply cut his hair and left. The entire time she was in that room, he probably didn\u2019t say a dozen words to her. Not until she was back in Cedar Cove did she learn that he\u2019d won the next match and the one after that.</p><p>\u201cHave you heard from him since?\u201d Justine asked.</p><p>Teri arranged the cape over Justine\u2019s shoulders and fastened it. \u201cMe? Nah. I didn\u2019t even tell him my name.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t talk to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. Nothing I\u2019d consider a conversation, anyway.\u201d In fact, Bobby Polgar hadn\u2019t even bothered to pay her, which was a damn shame since she\u2019d had to borrow twenty bucks to get to Seattle. But then, to be fair, Teri hadn\u2019t asked for payment.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Bobby like?\u201d</p><p>Teri held up a comb as she thought about Justine\u2019s question. All week people had been asking her that and she was never sure what to tell them. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say, seeing he wasn\u2019t all that communicative. He\u2019s intense and...\u201d She wanted to say \u201cpeculiar\u201d but that didn\u2019t seem quite right. \u201cStrange,\u201d she finished. \u201cHe\u2019s just strange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey say he\u2019s one of the greatest chess minds of our time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is the greatest chess mind of our time,\u201d Teri corrected. That much she\u2019d garnered from Bobby himself, not to mention his handlers.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re a fan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot of Bobby, and not of chess, either. They don\u2019t teach you much about the theory of chess in beauty school, you know?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo what interested you in Bobby?\u201d Justine asked as they walked to the shampoo bowl.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Teri said slowly. \u201cI saw him on television one morning and thought he was interesting looking. Then he lost that chess match. I knew what was wrong and that I could help him. I do stuff like that. People need something, and I do what I can. My mother\u2019s the same way, God bless her.\u201d Her mother also had a tendency to fall for the wrong guys, another trait Teri was afraid she\u2019d inherited. At least Teri didn\u2019t see any reason to marry them. She\u2019d been through three or four rocky relationships, none of which had lasted more than six months. They\u2019d all ended with her wanting to kick herself for being so stupid. Teri liked to think of herself as savvy and smart; life, however, had a way of proving her wrong.</p><p>Teri lowered Justine\u2019s head into the shampoo bowl. Their eyes met, and Teri offered her a quick smile as she turned on the water.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Teri,\u201d Justine said, suddenly intent.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor not asking about the fire. That\u2019s all anyone ever talks about. I haven\u2019t gone out of the house in weeks, except when it\u2019s absolutely necessary, because every time I do, people bombard me with questions.\u201d</p><p>The truth was, Teri had forgotten about the fire. With her own small world spinning around her brief moment of notoriety, the destruction of The Lighthouse had slipped her mind.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Teri asked. One look at Justine said she wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Justine didn\u2019t seem to hear and closed her eyes. Teri had discovered that there was something about working on women\u2019s hair that had a relaxing effect on them and led to confidences and disclosures they might make at no other time. Barriers were lowered, and they discussed their lives and problems with surprising openness. Teri was convinced it had to do with her being admitted to their personal space, as well as her undivided focus and the soothing atmosphere at the salon. She sometimes said she should put out a shingle advertising that she did hair with free counseling on the side. She certainly had enough experience to know what not to do when it came to unhealthy relationships.</p><p>\u201cSeth and I are having a few problems,\u201d Justine confessed, sounding sad and lost. Her voice was so low Teri had to strain to hear. \u201cWe\u2019ll be all right.... It\u2019s just that things are difficult now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich they\u2019re bound to be after something this upsetting,\u201d Teri reassured her. Again, their eyes met.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t made love in weeks,\u201d Justine whispered. \u201cNot since the fire. Seth is so angry. He doesn\u2019t know how to deal with this.\u201d She closed her eyes again, and Teri gently squeezed her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you worry,\u201d Teri said. \u201cEverything will work out, you wait and see.\u201d She didn\u2019t mean to serve up platitudes; every word was sincere. Teri had seen it happen over and over. Some trauma would upset a family and it was the marriage that took the brunt of that strain\u2014but if the relationship was strong, husband and wife could survive it together.</p><p>\u201cHow long have I been cutting your hair?\u201d Teri asked. It wasn\u2019t a rhetorical question.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Justine replied. \u201cSix or seven years for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. I remember when you were dating Warren Saget. I never did understand what you saw in that geezer, but who you decided to date was your business. Then Seth came along and\u2014oh, my goodness\u2014you were dumbstruck. I ran into you down by the waterfront one Saturday, and I saw the way you looked at each other. You two were crazy in love, no mistake about that.\u201d</p><p>Justine\u2019s eyes stayed closed as Teri washed her hair, but she smiled. \u201cI remember those days, too. We couldn\u2019t keep our hands off each other.\u201d</p><p>Teri grinned. \u201cYou pretended Seth meant nothing to you. I made the mistake of mentioning his name one time, and you nearly bit my head off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI most certainly did not,\u201d Justine protested.</p><p>\u201cDid, too,\u201d Teri retorted, working the shampoo into the long, thick hair. \u201cI\u2019ll bet Seth still looks at you the same way he did back then. There\u2019s no denying that man loves you and you love him. Just hang in there, okay?\u201d</p><p>Justine opened her eyes and blinked up at her. \u201cI hope you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>Denise, the part-time receptionist, approached Teri as she finished the shampoo. \u201cThere\u2019s someone here to see you,\u201d she said.</p><p>Teri wrapped the towel around Justine\u2019s head. \u201cDid you get a name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t give me one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe?\u201d Joan, Jane and the other girls all stopped what they were doing and stared at her.</p><p>\u201cGo check it out,\u201d Rachel suggested from where she sat doing the mayor\u2019s wife\u2019s nails.</p><p>Teri led Justine to her station and dried her hands. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d she promised.</p><p>A tall, extremely thin man hovered just inside the salon. He glanced nervously around, as though afraid one of the stylists would tackle him, tie him up and dye his hair pink.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Teri Miller,\u201d she said, hand on her hip. She wasn\u2019t buying anything and she didn\u2019t have time for chitchat, either.</p><p>\u201cBobby Polgar would like to speak with you,\u201d he announced, clearly expecting her to drop everything immediately. \u201cHe\u2019s in the car outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her first reaction was astonishment.</p><p>\u201cMiss Miller,\u201d the thin man added, \u201cMr. Polgar doesn\u2019t like to be kept waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that right?\u201d Teri muttered, frowning at him. She remembered now that she\u2019d seen this guy at the chess match with Bobby and had assumed he was either a friend or employee. \u201cWell, it so happens I\u2019m busy, and I\u2019m going to be busy all day. Kindly tell Mr. Polgar that if he wants to see me, he should make an appointment like everyone else.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTeri,\u201d Joan cried in utter exasperation. \u201cDon\u2019t be an idiot. He probably wants to thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs he should,\u201d Teri reminded her friends. The man owed her, and all she\u2019d gotten for her trouble was an escorted exit from the competition. Not only had Bobby Polgar not paid her, he hadn\u2019t seen fit to thank her, either.</p><p>\u201cMiss?\u201d the man asked again.</p><p>Everyone in the salon seemed to be watching her, waiting for her to decide.</p> <p>For a second she was tempted to walk out to the car and listen politely while the great Bobby Polgar deigned to grant her an audience. But frankly, she wasn\u2019t that hard up. Nor did she want to give this...chessman the idea that she was at his beck and call.</p><p>\u201cPlease thank Mr. Polgar for coming,\u201d Teri said smoothly, \u201cbut explain that I have a full schedule today and am unavailable until after six o\u2019clock.\u201d With that, she turned to see her friends and customers staring at her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Mr. Polgar will be pleased,\u201d the man said.</p><p>Teri shook her head. In her opinion, too many people already catered to Bobby Polgar\u2019s likes and dislikes. It was about time someone stood up to him.</p><p>When she returned to Justine, it seemed the entire salon had gone silent. \u201cWhat?\u201d Teri demanded.</p> <p>Activity resumed, and she heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>A few minutes later, Denise was back. \u201cThat skinny guy asked me to give you this.\u201d She handed her a hundred-dollar bill.</p><p>Teri shrugged and stuffed it in her hip pocket. Apparently there was even more money in chess than she\u2019d guessed. A hundred bucks for a haircut was about four times what she normally charged. She\u2019d say one thing for Bobby Polgar\u2014he was a decent tipper.</p><p>When Teri finished Justine\u2019s cut, Grace Harding arrived for a perm. Grace tried to book all her perms on weekends because she worked full-time at the library.</p><p>In fact, Grace\u2019s perm was the first of three Teri had scheduled for the day.</p><p>By six that evening, her feet hurt and she hadn\u2019t managed to have lunch. She was hungry, tired and feeling irritable about a certain spoiled chess player who was far too accustomed to getting his own way. Still, Teri was gratified that Bobby Polgar had made the effort to find out who she was and where she worked.</p> <p>Actually, that was a noteworthy feat. She hadn\u2019t given anyone her name, although now that she recalled, some of those pushy security people had checked her identification.</p><p>Teri was the last person to leave the salon that night. She set a final load of towels in the dryer, turned off the lights and headed out the door, locking it carefully before leaving the mall. Her feet hurt, and she was looking forward to a soak in her tub, a microwave pizza and a good book.</p><p>The stretch limo in the rear of the mall lot caught her attention right away. As soon as Teri appeared, the car started moving in her direction.</p><p>Teri froze.</p><p>Sure enough, the car slowed to a crawl and stopped directly beside her. The door opened. Apparently she was supposed to get in, no questions asked.</p><p>She bent over and looked inside.</p><p>Just as she\u2019d suspected, there sat Bobby Polgar. This car could easily seat ten thin people or maybe eight women her size. Yet the only person inside was the chess player.</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you see me?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cI told your driver I was booked for the day. I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have time now?\u201d He gestured toward the seat next to him. She studied him critically\u2014he was of average height and build and wore glasses with dark frames. Quite nerdy looking, really. He didn\u2019t appear to give much thought to fashion...or anything other than chess.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked, genuinely curious.</p><p>Her question seemed to surprise him. \u201cSo we can talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do we have to talk about?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cAre you always this much trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she told him truthfully. \u201cBut I had a very busy day and I\u2019m tired.\u201d</p><p>He frowned as though he found her statement puzzling. \u201cYou weren\u2019t busy last Saturday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a lighter schedule. I rescheduled two afternoon appointments in order to get to Seattle.\u201d She didn\u2019t mention the money she\u2019d borrowed.</p><p>\u201cYour diagnosis was correct,\u201d he reminded her. He leaned forward and offered her his hand. \u201cI won the match.\u201d</p><p>Capitulating, Teri reluctantly climbed inside the limo, which was the biggest one she\u2019d ever seen. She ran her hand over the plush upholstery and gazed up. The ceiling had lights that changed color every few seconds, subtle pastel colors that gave the interior a soft, flattering glow.</p><p>\u201cWould you like something to drink?\u201d Bobby asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019ve you got?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d was his reply.</p><p>\u201cA beer sounds good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA beer,\u201d he repeated as if he\u2019d never heard the word before.</p><p>\u201cPreferably a cold one.\u201d</p><p>Bobby pushed a button and spoke into an intercom. \u201cA cold beer for the lady, James.\u201d</p><p>Teri nearly burst out laughing. \u201cYour driver\u2019s name is James?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat amuses you?\u201d He wore the same puzzled look he had earlier.</p><p>She did a poor job of hiding her amusement. \u201cIt\u2019s just so...clich\u00e9d.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d he asked, his expression still bewildered.</p><p>The car took off.</p><p>\u201cHey, just a minute,\u201d Teri said, glancing around, suddenly unsure. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>Bobby stared at her. \u201cTo get you a cold beer. Don\u2019t worry. James can be trusted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI trust James. You\u2019re the one who\u2019s got me worried.\u201d</p><p>Bobby Polgar nearly smiled. \u201cI like you. You\u2019re a little on the fat side but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re on the rude side,\u201d she interrupted. \u201cNow take me back to my car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a minute.\u201d He seemed to be in no hurry.</p><p>She crossed her arms. Never had she dreamed she\u2019d be riding in a vehicle like this. \u201cI thought you would\u2019ve left the area by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you pleased to see me?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cNot particularly.\u201d</p><p>He frowned.</p><p>Teri supposed that Mr. Bobby Big Shot wasn\u2019t used to someone unwilling to pander to his gigantic ego. \u201cYou know, you didn\u2019t pay me last Saturday. That\u2019s fine, although payment at the time is customary. I didn\u2019t intend on charging you\u2014but it would\u2019ve been nice if you\u2019d offered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got the money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you. That was a pretty hefty tip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou deserved it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t bother to thank me, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he agreed, \u201cI didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t think much about anything other than chess.\u201d</p><p>As if she hadn\u2019t figured that out.</p><p>The car stopped. About three minutes later the door opened and James, the man who\u2019d come into the salon earlier, handed Teri a cold beer.</p><p>\u201cThank you, James,\u201d she murmured, stifling a laugh.</p><p>The driver began to close the door.</p><p>\u201cJames,\u201d Bobby said simply, \u201cI\u2019d like one, too.\u201d</p><p>James did a double take, obviously wondering if he\u2019d heard correctly. \u201cYou, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight away, sir.\u201d</p><p>The door closed. \u201cYou like yes-men, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Bobby studied her a moment and once more, came close to smiling. \u201cWhen you\u2019re as rich and celebrated as I am, most everyone is a yes-man.\u201d</p><p>She flipped back the pull tab and took a long, thirsty swallow. \u201cNot me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I noticed.\u201d</p><p>The door opened again, and James gave his boss a second can of beer. Bobby took it and examined the top. He reached for the tab, but apparently couldn\u2019t get his finger under it.</p><p>\u201cOh, for the love of heaven,\u201d Teri muttered. She grabbed it, balancing her own can between her knees. \u201cYou\u2019re helpless.\u201d</p><p>Bobby met her gaze and then he did smile. \u201cYou\u2019re the first person to really see that, Miss Teri Miller. I am rather helpless.\u201d</p><p>Twelve</p><p>\u201cCal\u2019s here,\u201d Linnette said loudly, peering out the living room window on Easter afternoon. She\u2019d been helping her mother in the kitchen, preparing dinner, and had begun to set the table. Dropping the curtain, Linnette hurried to the front door, but then felt she needed to give her family a reminder. \u201cMom, Dad, please don\u2019t embarrass him,\u201d she cautioned.</p><p>Her father glanced up from the Seattle newspaper, which he read from front to back every Sunday. \u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been seeing a speech therapist in Silverdale and he\u2019s kind of self-conscious. Sometimes he hesitates between words, but don\u2019t pay any attention to that, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d Her father went back to reading the paper.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, sweetheart,\u201d her mother said from the kitchen doorway.</p><p>The doorbell chimed and Linnette opened it to Cal, who couldn\u2019t have looked handsomer had he tried. He wore a tan leather jacket, polished boots and pressed jeans. His beautiful blue eyes searched hers out, and Linnette reassured him with a grin. Reaching for his hand, she pulled him into the house.</p><p>\u201cHello, Cal,\u201d her father said, briefly lowering the paper.</p><p>\u201cWelcome, Cal,\u201d her mother called from the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cIt smells good in here,\u201d Cal said without stumbling over a single word.</p><p>Linnette\u2019s heart swelled with pride at his fluent delivery. \u201cThat\u2019s the ham. Mom coats it with brown sugar and maple syrup and tops it with cloves. I\u2019ve never tasted any ham better than hers. It\u2019s just wonderful, so be sure and compliment her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll package up some of the leftovers for you. There\u2019s always plenty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t be giving away my ham,\u201d her father chastised in a humorous tone.</p><p>Cal looked around the room and Linnette knew what he was thinking. She answered the question he\u2019d wordlessly asked. \u201cMack\u2019s on his way,\u201d she said. \u201cHe phoned. Apparently the bridge traffic is a nightmare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGloria?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill be here by four.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s working. Low man on the totem pole,\u201d Roy explained. \u201cIn this case, low woman.\u201d</p><p>Her newfound sister was a Bremerton police officer. Before moving to Cedar Cove, Roy had worked for the Seattle Police department. Linnette found it interesting\u2014and very fitting\u2014that Gloria had chosen the same profession.</p><p>She\u2019d initially made contact with her birth parents by sending anonymous postcards, flower arrangements and other benign but puzzling messages. Eventually, Roy unearthed the mystery and Gloria was welcomed into the family. However, they were still finding their way with one another, treading carefully, creating a new dynamic. This afternoon would be a test.</p><p>\u201cGloria said we should start without her,\u201d Linnette murmured, \u201cbut I told her we wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll call if she gets held up,\u201d Roy said confidently. He\u2019d spent quite a bit of time with Gloria, and at first Linnette had been afraid that sharing her father would be difficult, since she and her dad had a close relationship. But it didn\u2019t bother her at all\u2014mainly, Linnette believed, because she had Cal. Since their working hours often conflicted, they weren\u2019t able to see each other as often as they would\u2019ve liked. If it was up to Linnette, that would be every day. But she had to be content with phone calls and seeing each other twice a week, if that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lately Cal had been in town more often because of his visits to the speech therapist. He usually stopped in to see her on the way to his appointment or afterward. The progress he\u2019d made in such a short time was truly impressive.</p><p>\u201cI was putting the finishing touches on the table,\u201d Linnette said. \u201cYou want to help me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLinnette.\u201d Her father\u2019s voice betrayed some impatience. \u201cCal\u2019s our guest. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good form to ask him to set the table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Daddy,\u201d she muttered, smiling at Cal.</p> <p>Cal grinned back and sat down on the sofa. Her father handed him a section of newspaper, which Cal accepted.</p><p>Linnette returned to the kitchen. \u201cThe least Dad could do is talk to him,\u201d she told her mother.</p><p>Corrie shook her head. \u201cYou know your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the man I\u2019ll probably marry.\u201d She truly hoped that was the case. Cal hadn\u2019t brought up the subject of marriage yet, but as far as Linnette could tell, they were definitely headed in that direction.</p><p>The doorbell rang again, and before anyone could answer, Mack walked into the house bearing a tall lily with three huge blooms. Her brother had trimmed his hair and actually looked decent. Well...halfway decent. This was an effort to appease their father, Linnette guessed. He wore jeans, sandals and a flowered shirt that made her shudder slightly. He needed a woman to help him dress better, but she wasn\u2019t volunteering. Lucky followed him in and settled by the fireplace.</p> <p>\u201cHappy Easter, everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen\u2019s the Easter egg hunt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too old for chocolate bunnies,\u201d Corrie laughed, coming out of the kitchen. She kissed her son on the cheek and made a fuss over the lily, then placed it in the center of the dining room table.</p><p>Cal stood, and the two men shook hands. Linnette was immediately concerned. She hadn\u2019t mentioned to her brother that Cal was working with a speech therapist and feared Mack might say something that would unintentionally embarrass him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s for dinner?\u201d Mack rubbed his palms together, as if he was ready to start eating that minute. \u201cI\u2019m starved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. We\u2019ll begin as soon as Gloria gets here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you didn\u2019t make those little cheese rolls?\u201d Mack asked, clearly disappointed.</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Roy said, setting aside the newspaper. \u201cWhat about a few appetizers to tide us over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re coming,\u201d Corrie said. \u201cRoy, could you see what everyone wants to drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom bakes these little cheese-filled biscuits Mack loves,\u201d Linnette explained for Cal\u2019s sake. \u201cYou\u2019ll want to taste them, but don\u2019t overdo it or you\u2019ll ruin your dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d he promised.</p><p>\u201cNo matter what holiday it is, Mack wants Mom to bake cheese biscuits. Easter, Thanksgiving. Christmas...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGroundhog Day,\u201d her brother added, as their father got to his feet to offer drinks.</p><p>\u201cThey sound good,\u201d Cal agreed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a beer, Dad.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMe, too, Mr. McAfee,\u201d Cal put in.</p><p>Mack suddenly turned to him. \u201cHey, Cal\u2014\u201d</p><p>Linnette kicked his ankle.</p><p>\u201cOuch. What was that for?\u201d Mack demanded.</p><p>Linnette blushed. \u201cOh, sorry, did I kick you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and it hurt.\u201d Her brother rubbed his ankle.</p><p>\u201cCome help me in the kitchen, would you?\u201d she said pointedly and half dragged her brother out of the living room. As soon as they were out of earshot, she whispered fiercely, \u201cDon\u2019t embarrass Cal! He\u2019s seeing a speech therapist about his stutter. Having everyone comment only calls attention to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only person embarrassing Cal,\u201d her brother said in a whisper, \u201cis you. Give the guy a break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re suffocating him,\u201d Mack insisted. \u201cAnd if you keep doing that, you\u2019re going to lose him.\u201d</p><p>Linnette started to tell her brother he was being ridiculous but then the doorbell rang a third time. Gloria had arrived. She still wore her police uniform. \u201cI didn\u2019t take time to change,\u201d she said, \u201cI hope that\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Chad?\u201d Linnette asked. She knew that Chad Timmons, the physician she worked with at the clinic, was interested in Gloria.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask him to join us,\u201d Gloria said as she removed her jacket; Roy took it to hang in the hallway closet.</p><p>Linnette was disappointed for Chad, who\u2019d been hoping for an invitation.</p><p>\u201cCan we eat now?\u201d Mack asked impatiently.</p><p>\u201cDid I hold up dinner?\u201d Gloria wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Corrie assured her. \u201cI thought you wanted appetizers,\u201d she reminded her son.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they\u2019re on the way.\u201d</p><p>They all sat in the living room, waiting for Corrie. Linnette was at Cal\u2019s side and took his hand, entwining their fingers. Her mother had returned to the kitchen and now carried a plate of Mack\u2019s favorite cheese biscuits, along with a veggie tray and dips. Roy passed out drinks\u2014beers for all the men and glasses of white wine for the women.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll love this dip Mom makes, too,\u201d Linnette said, dipping a carrot stick in a rich creamy mixture and handing it to Cal.</p><p>\u201cI was in Cedar Cove earlier this week,\u201d Mack said as he filled a small plate. The cheese biscuits were still hot, and he burned his finger. \u201cOuch, dammit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t come by,\u201d Corrie murmured.</p><p>\u201cBy the time I finished, all I wanted to do was get home and take a hot shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinished what?\u201d Linnette asked her brother.</p><p>Mack straightened and looked around the room. \u201cI applied with the Cedar Cove fire department,\u201d he announced.</p><p>\u201cWhat does the application process involve?\u201d Gloria leaned forward, serving herself a small plate of appetizers.</p><p>Mack took a gulp of beer. \u201cI had to complete a physical test, and I\u2019m not talking about some doc listening to my heart, either. This was running up flights of stairs and stuff like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you do?\u201d their father asked.</p><p>From the gleam in his eyes, Linnette knew her brother had passed. \u201cAll right, I guess. I\u2019m taking the written exam next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you like this sort of work, since you\u2019re a volunteer firefighter,\u201d Roy said. \u201cAt least you know exactly what you\u2019re in for.\u201d The two hadn\u2019t always gotten along, but Linnette could see they were both making an effort. Roy didn\u2019t add that he\u2019d much prefer having his son a firefighter than working for the post office, although that wasn\u2019t exactly a secret.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Mack responded. \u201cI hope they hire me\u2014and the truth is, I wouldn\u2019t mind being closer to everyone on this side of the water. If I do get the job, it means I\u2019ll be attending firefighting school for ten weeks. There\u2019s one near North Bend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d love having you live closer,\u201d Corrie told her son, her face glowing with happiness. \u201cAnd ten weeks will pass quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might be leaving for a while, too,\u201d Cal said.</p><p>\u201cLeaving?\u201d Linnette cried. Why hadn\u2019t she heard of this before? That he\u2019d chosen to bring it up at a family function distressed her. \u201cWhere are you going and why? You won\u2019t be gone long, I hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cM-mustangs,\u201d he said, faltering over a word for the first time that day.</p><p>\u201cWhat about mustangs?\u201d she said, pressing him. When they were alone, she\u2019d ask him more, but already she didn\u2019t like the sound of this.</p><p>\u201cWild mustangs\u2014f-feral horses\u2014are being rounded up by the Bureau of Land Management. Then they\u2019re sold. Cliff and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCliff is sending you away? When?\u201d</p><p>Cal ignored her questions. \u201cThese wild horses, some of them, are being slaughtered. The BLM m-m-makes them available for adoption, and several rescue organizations\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCliff wants to add mustangs to his herd?\u201d Linnette asked, too upset to allow Cal to finish. \u201cHe can send anyone. He doesn\u2019t need to send you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLinnette,\u201d Gloria said gently, \u201clet Cal talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to v-volunteer with the BLM and help round up mustangs and get them to the adoption centers.\u201d He seemed to speak without stopping for breath. \u201cI want to see that they\u2019re p-protected. A lot of them are sold at auction and, like I said, some end up being slaughtered. I hope to work with one of the rescue groups to prevent that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long will you be away?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Cal shrugged. \u201cA month, maybe more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA month?\u201d That was completely unreasonable. Wouldn\u2019t this be a hardship for Cliff? Furthermore, it would be difficult on them as a couple. Surely a man didn\u2019t walk away from a relationship this strong without discussing the prospect with the woman in his life. She didn\u2019t understand why Cal hadn\u2019t mentioned his interest in volunteering before now. Nor did she appreciate the fact that he\u2019d revealed it in front of her family and not told her first.</p><p>Perhaps Linnette was overreacting, but Cal was doing so well with his therapy and their relationship was everything to her. She couldn\u2019t bear it if he left\u2014even for a short time.</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s a wonderful thing for you to do,\u201d Corrie said. Thanks, Mom, Linnette thought irritably.</p><p>\u201cI do, too,\u201d Mack concurred. \u201cI\u2019ve read about what\u2019s happening to those wild horses and it\u2019s a crying shame.\u201d</p><p>It was a crying shame, all right, Linnette mused. But the only one she felt sorry for was herself. She didn\u2019t want Cal to leave Cedar Cove, but it almost seemed as if he couldn\u2019t get away fast enough.</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>The Monday after Easter, Maryellen woke in good spirits\u2014despite another night on the sofa. She missed sleeping with her husband, missed the intimacy they\u2019d shared. Once this baby was born, she vowed she\u2019d never sleep on a sofa again as long as she lived.</p><p>Easter Sunday had been wonderful. When church services were over, Joseph and Ellen had taken Katie to a community Easter egg hunt. Katie had gleefully collected a basketful of colorful plastic eggs. She\u2019d proudly showed her treasures to Maryellen and then later Jon. Her husband had conveniently disappeared when the Bowmans returned with Katie.</p><p>Katie had needed a week or so to become accustomed to Jon\u2019s parents, but by then her daughter realized she had these two people completely wrapped around her little finger. Joseph and Ellen lavished their granddaughter with attention and love. Katie was thriving, and Maryellen would be forever grateful for their presence.</p><p>The Bowmans\u2019 arrival had gone a long way toward bringing Maryellen peace during this complicated pregnancy. Her mother and Cliff helped as much as they could, and had decided to delay their wedding reception until after the baby\u2019s birth. Grace visited at least three times a week and brought Maryellen library books to keep her entertained. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Charlotte and several ladies from the Senior Center had been out, too. Charlotte had taught Maryellen how to knit and she\u2019d caught on quickly. Under Charlotte\u2019s tutelage, she\u2019d started a baby blanket. However, none of these distractions was enough to keep Maryellen\u2019s mind off the financial difficulties caused by her unemployment. Jon couldn\u2019t work and take care of both Katie and her. Now, at least, he was able to spend the days taking photographs and had sold a few to the Chronicle and other area papers, as well as providing prints to the galleries that carried his work. He\u2019d even applied for a few jobs, which had come to nothing.</p><p>Joseph and Ellen\u2019s presence had made a difference that was as profound as that between night and day. Jon couldn\u2019t deny that their generosity had changed everything; still, he avoided all contact with his parents. He left in the morning and called every night before he got home. His call was the signal that his parents should leave.</p><p>Maryellen was distressed that he could be so coldhearted toward his family. Distressed and scared, too. If he could so completely turn off his love for them, then he might be capable of doing the same to her and to their daughter.</p><p>She knew very well that the only reason Jon had allowed his family into his life was for her sake and Katie\u2019s.</p> <p>He refused to acknowledge their help or show them any appreciation. Joseph and Ellen had remained respectful of his wishes. The minute he notified Maryellen that he was on his way home, they packed up and left. The fact that dinner was waiting for him on his return was never mentioned or credited to his parents. As much as possible, he ignored their very existence. Maryellen felt dreadful for his father and stepmother.</p><p>When she heard Jon tiptoe down the stairs in the early dawn, Maryellen smiled. Their time alone on Easter Sunday had been special and she refused to ruin today with any unpleasantness.</p><p>\u201cYou awake?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She nodded and held out her arms to him. Jon joined her on the sofa, lying beside her. He placed his hands on her growing abdomen. They giggled and cuddled close.</p><p>\u201cAfter this baby\u2019s born, I\u2019m never sleeping without you again,\u201d he said, spreading warm kisses on her throat until he reached her lips for a series of deep, probing kisses. Groaning, he tore his mouth from hers and buried it in the hollow of her neck. After a moment, he whispered, \u201cI miss you sleeping with me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI miss you, too.\u201d His body was so familiar to her and so beloved. She reveled in the feel of him pressed against her. Had their circumstances been different, they would\u2019ve made love. It wouldn\u2019t be long before all of this was over, Maryellen reminded herself. She had to repeat that thought frequently throughout the day\u2014and night.</p><p>\u201cKatie\u2019s still asleep,\u201d Jon told her.</p><p>\u201cShe had a busy day yesterday. Oh, Jon, I can\u2019t tell you how good Ellen is with her.\u201d</p><p>Her husband went rigid, just as he always did whenever she mentioned his parents.</p><p>Maryellen rubbed his back. \u201cDid you see the giant Easter basket they bought her? It\u2019s got a plush bunny and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want them spoiling her rotten.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSweetheart, that\u2019s what grandparents do.\u201d She paused. \u201cThey love her so much,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>Without a word, Jon slipped off the sofa and went into the adjacent kitchen to start a pot of coffee. She watched him grind beans, then add water.</p><p>\u201cI knew this would happen,\u201d he said to her from the doorway a moment later, his voice ringing with resentment.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked, sitting upright now. \u201cYou\u2019re afraid I\u2019ll refer to your parents in casual conversation? That\u2019s what you fear? Do you have any idea how ridiculous that sounds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe minute they got here, you were championing their cause. It\u2019s not going to work, Maryellen. I told you that before and I\u2019m telling you again now. Nothing\u2019s changed between them and me. Not one damn thing.\u201d</p><p>She flinched at the harshness of his words. \u201cBut Jon\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not talk about it anymore. I let them come because you wanted it, and for no other reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been a tremendous help. How can you deny what your parents have done for us? Jon, they left their home. They\u2019re staying at one of those hotels off the highway, and all because they want to be near us during this time. The least we can do is show some appreciation.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t help me,\u201d he said with unrestrained anger. \u201cInstead, they lied. They should count their blessings that I didn\u2019t get them charged with perjury. Then they would\u2019ve gone to prison like I did.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen forced herself to remain calm. \u201cYes, they did lie, and because of it you went through hell. They paid the price for that, Jon, and they paid dearly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Maryellen,\u201d her husband said, \u201cI\u2019m the one who paid. I was the one behind bars. Do you know how I got through those years? Do you really want to know? By hating them. I swore I\u2019d never have anything to do with either of them again.\u201d</p><p>It pained her to hear the bitterness in his voice. Jon was a passionate man, who felt everything deeply. Anyone who studied his photography could see that, could sense his emotion.</p><p>A picture as simple as an empty rowboat tied up at a dock was sharply evocative. One reviewer had said that the abandoned rowboat was an object that had its own integrity and yet also symbolized lost dreams. Maryellen loved that review, and she\u2019d clipped it and kept it in a special file. She agreed with every word. Years ago, she\u2019d fallen in love with his art, long before she even knew the man.</p><p>So, it was no surprise that Jon\u2019s emotions, both positive and negative, had such potency. His hatred for his parents was uncompromising. He loved with this same intensity. Maryellen could never doubt the depth of his feelings for her and their children. He\u2019d sacrificed for her; he\u2019d even been willing to give up this land, and the home he\u2019d built with his own hands, for her and for Katie and the new baby.</p><p>The silence between them seemed to throb like a fresh wound. The only sound was that of the coffeemaker gurgling. Jon returned to the kitchen to pour himself a mug and heat water for herbal tea in the microwave.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said when he brought her the tea.</p><p>He sat down across from her. \u201cI don\u2019t want to argue, Maryellen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe neither.\u201d She offered him a sad smile.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he said. \u201cI won\u2019t allow my parents to come between us. I can\u2019t. They took everything else away from me, and I won\u2019t let them steal you and Katie, too.\u201d</p><p>She sipped her tea and tried to see the situation from his point of view. \u201cI was just thinking how unusual this is. It\u2019s the reverse of what normally happens, where the wife doesn\u2019t get along with her in-laws.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, Jon cupped the mug. \u201cI like my in-laws just fine,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s my own family I don\u2019t care for.\u201d He checked his watch and stood, ending their conversation. \u201cI need to get ready for an interview.\u201d</p><p>The comment caught her off guard. Jon hadn\u2019t said anything about applying for another job. He took photographs that sold in galleries, and she hoped to begin managing his career later this year, finding ways to give him more exposure and license his work. Maryellen had been reading about it on the Internet, using a laptop computer Cliff had lent her.</p><p>\u201cAn interview?\u201d she echoed. \u201cYou didn\u2019t say anything about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing great,\u201d he said as he headed up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cBut...you always tell me when you\u2019re going to a job interview.\u201d A couple of opportunities had come his way recently, neither of which had panned out. Jon had talked to her at length before and after each interview. One had been for a construction job with Warren Saget\u2019s company. However, Jon had discovered that Warren used shortcuts and inferior materials. He was currently building an apartment complex and rumor had it that there were already major problems on the site. Although he possessed excellent carpentry skills and would gladly have taken on a construction project, Jon and Maryellen had agreed that, for ethical reasons, he shouldn\u2019t work for Warren Saget. Seth Gunderson wanted him back at the new\u2014as yet unbuilt\u2014Lighthouse, but Jon couldn\u2019t wait that long. He\u2019d applied for some restaurant jobs, too.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I mentioned this,\u201d Jon threw over his shoulder as he dashed up the stairs to their bedroom.</p><p>No, he hadn\u2019t; Maryellen would\u2019ve remembered it. She had the unpleasant sensation that he was hiding something from her. Only, she couldn\u2019t imagine what it would be, or why. When he came down the stairs, dressed and freshly shaved, Maryellen was ready. She\u2019d slowly made her way to the kitchen, where she sat at the table.</p><p>\u201cTell me about this interview,\u201d she said as he popped a slice of bread in the toaster. He placed a bowl with instant oatmeal in the microwave and sliced a banana for her breakfast.</p><p>He glanced up. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing special,\u201d he countered.</p><p>\u201cIs it a cooking job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said curtly.</p><p>\u201cApparently it\u2019s something you don\u2019t want to tell me about. Something you\u2019d rather not mention.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019ve never kept secrets from me before,\u201d she said softly, unable to disguise the hurt. \u201cPlease don\u2019t start now.\u201d</p><p>He released a pent-up sigh. \u201cAll right, if you must know. The interview\u2019s with a portrait studio in Tacoma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Jon, that\u2019s great!\u201d It was probably a waste of his talent, but she wasn\u2019t going to say that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be photographing schoolchildren and...\u201d</p><p>Maryellen swallowed hard and struggled to hide her dismay. This was so far beneath Jon\u2019s abilities. It would stifle his creativity, kill his passion for photography. No wonder he\u2019d been reluctant to tell her about this interview.</p><p>An involuntary sob escaped and she covered her face with both hands.</p><p>\u201cMaryellen, don\u2019t.\u201d He came to kneel in front of her. \u201cHoney, it\u2019s the only thing available. It\u2019ll pay the bills, even if it doesn\u2019t provide any benefits.\u201d He wrapped his arms around her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll hate it.\u201d He was willing to waste his considerable talent at this menial job, and all because of her.</p><p>Kissing the top of her head, he said, \u201cI\u2019ve had worse jobs. This won\u2019t be for long, I promise you. I won\u2019t be home much, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want it that way. You want out of the house because...because you can\u2019t stand the thought of your parents being here, and that\u2019s my fault, too. Sometimes I think this baby\u2019s going to destroy us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he warned gently. \u201cMaryellen, you can\u2019t think like that. This baby is a gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t let you do this. Jon, please. I just can\u2019t bear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, don\u2019t.\u201d He took her face between his hands and kissed her again and again. \u201cI love you. I\u2019m doing this for us. As soon as the baby\u2019s born, everything will be different. I promise.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, Jon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he said soothingly. \u201cEverything\u2019s going to be all right.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen so badly wanted to believe him. She smiled absently as he brought her breakfast to the table, although she could barely eat.</p><p>Jon left shortly afterward, and Maryellen tried hard to conceal her feelings when Ellen and Joseph came in. Ellen immediately went upstairs to get Katie dressed, while Joseph washed the few soiled dishes and straightened the books that were scattered around the living room.</p> <p>Midmorning, he took Katie outside for a walk in the sunshine, and Ellen brought Maryellen a cup of tea. \u201cI thought I\u2019d make a chicken pot pie for dinner this evening,\u201d she said. \u201cIt used to be one of Jon\u2019s favorites.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll appreciate it,\u201d Maryellen said, but she had to wonder if Jon would even notice.</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>Justine was grateful to hear from her mother and even happier to see her. Late Wednesday afternoon they met for tea at 16 Lighthouse Road, the house where she\u2019d grown up and where Olivia still lived. In a sense, Justine would always think of it as home. Leif had a play date with a friend from his preschool, and it was good to be with Olivia, just the two of them.</p><p>\u201cJack\u2019s out doing an interview with Pastor Flemming about the church\u2019s work with hurricane relief,\u201d her mother explained as she carried the teapot and a plate of oatmeal cookies to the kitchen table.</p> <p>This was Olivia\u2019s way of telling her that the timing of this visit was intentional\u2014a chance for the two of them to be alone. Only a few years ago Justine couldn\u2019t have imagined sharing her troubles with her mother. They\u2019d rarely talked or discussed anything of importance. Now it seemed only natural to do so.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to talk about?\u201d Justine asked. If her mother had purposely arranged this time to make sure they weren\u2019t interrupted, then there had to be a reason.</p><p>Olivia glanced up from pouring the tea into china cups. \u201cI guess I wasn\u2019t very subtle, was I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Mom. I\u2019m your daughter\u2014you don\u2019t need to be subtle with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me how you\u2019re doing first?\u201d Olivia set the teapot in the center of the table, then took her seat.</p><p>Justine reached for her cup and added a teaspoon of sugar, making lazy circles with her spoon. \u201cI\u2019ve decided to go back to work part-time for First National Bank.\u201d She said this casually, as if it were a small thing. It wasn\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019ll be out of the house for part of every day.\u201d She was silent for a moment, wondering whether to talk about the underlying reason. \u201cGetting away from Seth helps me deal with all the stress,\u201d she admitted. She had to either spend time away from her husband for a few hours every day, while Leif was in preschool, or slowly go insane. She was relieved that Seth had talked to Larry Boone about taking the job at the boatyard but as yet nothing had come of it. She didn\u2019t know if the hesitation was due to Seth or the other man. Seth was so volatile that Justine hadn\u2019t asked for fear of causing problems.</p> <p>These last few weeks, living with Seth had felt like being trapped. His thoughts and all his efforts seemed to be focussed on finding the arsonist. Despite their brief attempt at resolving the tension between them, Seth was as driven as ever. The fire had consumed far more than the building that had housed their restaurant; it had consumed her husband, too. This angry, unreasonable person wasn\u2019t the man she\u2019d married and Justine felt she no longer knew him.</p><p>\u201cHow does Seth feel about your taking this job?\u201d her mother asked.</p><p>The sugar had dissolved but Justine continued her gentle stirring. \u201cI...haven\u2019t told him yet, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll care one way or the other.\u201d She doubted he\u2019d even realize she was gone.</p><p>\u201cOh, Justine.\u201d Her mother read the pain in her response. She leaned across the table and laid one hand over hers.</p><p>\u201cThe funny part is, I forgot to pick up my birth control prescription at the drugstore the other day and then I thought, why bother? Seth hasn\u2019t even come near me since the fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s upset.\u201d</p><p>Seth was more than upset, and making love couldn\u2019t compete with his need to be angry. Every bit of tenderness in him seemed to be gone. All that remained was his sense of unfairness and rage.</p><p>\u201cTo say he\u2019s upset doesn\u2019t even begin to cover it, Mom. Seth is impatient and edgy and determined to find out who started the fire. It\u2019s become an obsession. He wants me to be angry, too, and he can\u2019t understand why I\u2019m not.\u201d</p> <p>Olivia sipped her tea and sat back. \u201cYou\u2019re angry about this,\u201d she murmured. \u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course I am. But I want to let it go. I\u2019m trying to. I\u2019m choosing to look at this the way I would any other traumatic event. We need to move on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Seth\u2019s not ready to do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. And my lack of righteous anger complicates the issue,\u201d Justine went on, a bit wryly. She\u2019d given up reasoning with Seth. Any sort of acceptance on her part, or desire to advance to something new, only angered him further.</p><p>\u201cHe spoke to Jack recently,\u201d her mother said thoughtfully.</p><p>This was news to Justine, but then she knew little of what Seth did these days.</p><p>\u201cHe approached Jack about putting a picture of that pewter cross in the paper. Apparently that was Roy\u2019s idea. He and Seth think someone might recognize it and give the sheriff a lead. At this point, the investigation\u2019s stalled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Jack going to do it?\u201d</p><p>Her mother selected a cookie from the plate. \u201cI believe he said he\u2019d talk to the sheriff first and see if that would help or hinder the investigation.\u201d</p><p>Since Seth rather than the sheriff had spoken to Jack, Justine assumed that Troy Davis was reluctant to release this information. Most likely, Seth had gone behind the sheriff\u2019s back in an attempt to keep the investigation alive.</p><p>\u201cYou need to tell Seth you\u2019re going back to work,\u201d her mother advised.</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d But she wasn\u2019t in any hurry. They were barely speaking. For Leif\u2019s sake, they each made an effort to be civil in his presence. As far as Justine was concerned, though, they might as well be roommates. Or strangers.</p><p>\u201cIs that why you had lunch with Warren Saget?\u201d her mother asked, staring directly at her.</p><p>Shocked, Justine widened her eyes. Warren had taken her to lunch last week, but he\u2019d been careful to ensure they wouldn\u2019t be seen. They\u2019d met at a small, out-of-the-way restaurant in Gig Harbor. It\u2019d happened only once and Justine had felt guilty about it ever since. How her mother knew was beyond her, but it explained the invitation for tea in this private setting.</p><p>\u201cYou heard about that, did you?\u201d she asked, hoping to make light of the incident.</p><p>\u201cI did, and I probably wasn\u2019t the only one. I didn\u2019t know Warren was back in your life.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t, but saying so would only raise other questions she didn\u2019t want to answer. \u201cWarren\u2019s a friend of mine,\u201d she said tersely.</p><p>\u201cIs he, Justine?\u201d her mother asked point-blank.</p><p>It seemed that an explanation would be necessary, after all. \u201cSoon after the fire, Seth and I had an argument. I had to get away so I went down to the waterfront. While I was there, Warren joined me. All of a sudden I had a panic attack. I\u2019ve never had one before and Warren was extremely kind to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Justine! How frightening.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what was happening, but he calmed me down and talked me through it. Then last week he asked me to lunch and it seemed to mean so much to him, I couldn\u2019t say no.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have gone. I regret it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you thought what Seth would say if he knew?\u201d</p><p>Justine had foolishly believed no one would ever find out. Including her husband. So much for that theory. If her mother had heard about the lunch, then there wasn\u2019t any reason to believe Seth wouldn\u2019t eventually hear about it, too.</p><p>\u201cWho told you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAn attorney friend. It wasn\u2019t like Sharon came running to tell me, either. She hardly knows you and mentioned that she saw you in Gig Harbor with your father. I knew it couldn\u2019t have been Stan and surmised you must\u2019ve been with Warren.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t happen again, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s none of my business. This is your life, but I\u2019d hate to see you do something stupid that\u2019ll hurt you and your marriage.\u201d</p><p>Her mother was right. She had to talk to her husband, let him know how damaging his actions had been. Confrontation had never been easy for her but they needed to reconnect with each other before it was too late.</p><p>Justine went home soon afterward. She wasn\u2019t supposed to pick up Leif until dinnertime, and she\u2019d hoped to find Seth.</p><p>To her disappointment he wasn\u2019t home. Maybe she\u2019d drive over to her grandmother\u2019s place. Just as she got ready to turn around and leave, the front door opened and Seth stepped inside. Penny, their small dog, trotted over to greet him.</p><p>She and Seth stood several feet apart and stared as though they\u2019d never seen each other before. For the longest time all they did was look. Neither moved. Neither spoke.</p><p>A tightness gripped Justine\u2019s throat, and all at once tears filled her eyes and clogged her throat. She couldn\u2019t continue living the way they were, couldn\u2019t go on pretending everything was fine when it so clearly wasn\u2019t.</p><p>With all her heart she loved Seth, and she couldn\u2019t bear the thought of losing him. If she didn\u2019t do something, she would lose him. They\u2019d lose each other.</p><p>Out of need and fear, she took one step toward her husband. He did the same. Before she knew it, Justine was in his arms and Seth was kissing and hugging her as though they\u2019d been reunited after a lengthy absence. He tangled his fingers in her hair as he brought his mouth to hers. Tears spilled down her face and she was sobbing and kissing him back, all the while pulling his shirt free of his waistband. She needed her husband, wanted him.</p><p>Justine wasn\u2019t sure how they made it to the bedroom. Ravenous as they were for each other, they didn\u2019t even completely undress before they fell on the bed, gasping and panting.</p><p>By the time they\u2019d made love, Seth was half on the bed, his feet on the floor, while Justine was pinned to the edge of the mattress. They broke into wide grins.</p><p>\u201cOh, Seth,\u201d she whispered, \u201cI\u2019ve missed you so much.\u201d</p><p>He straightened and they climbed onto the bed, lying on their sides, facing each other. He kissed her chin and traced her cheekbones with one hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been the biggest fool who ever lived,\u201d Seth told her. \u201cWe lost the restaurant. That\u2019s tragic, but I still have what\u2019s most important in my life. You and Leif.\u201d</p><p>Tears clouded her eyes and she attempted a smile.</p><p>Seth continued to stroke her face. \u201cI went down to see Larry Boone this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Justine bit her lip.</p><p>\u201cI took the job, Justine. I\u2019m going to be selling boats.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A small cry of happiness escaped as she wrapped her arms around Seth\u2019s neck and hugged him with all her might.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad,\u201d she said, sobbing openly. \u201cEverything\u2019s going to be fine.\u201d That was when she told him about her lunch with Warren. From the way his mouth tightened and his eyes narrowed, she knew Seth wasn\u2019t pleased. But once the truth was out, Justine felt as if a backpack loaded with rocks had been removed from her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t see him again,\u201d she said. She gave him a long, involved kiss.</p><p>\u201cYou promise?\u201d Seth asked.</p> <p>\u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>Then she told him about the job at the bank, which she\u2019d be starting the following Monday.</p><p>His eyes revealed his astonishment. \u201cWhen did you arrange this?\u201d he asked, still frowning.</p><p>\u201cA week ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to work?\u201d</p> <p>She did\u2014for a dozen different reasons. She needed the escape into another world. She needed something to do; like him she\u2019d been at loose ends. When they\u2019d had the restaurant, she\u2019d worked nearly every day and now there was a void. The money would come in handy, too. \u201cJust a few hours a day. Do you mind?\u201d If he did, she\u2019d tell the bank she couldn\u2019t do it.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014it\u2019s totally up to you.\u201d</p><p>Although Justine hated to bring up the subject of the restaurant, she felt it was necessary. \u201cWhat about The Lighthouse?\u201d</p><p>A pained look came over Seth, as if even talking about it distressed him. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I just don\u2019t know.\u201d His gaze held hers as he used his index finger to outline the shape of her lips. His touch was gentle and his eyes filled with tenderness. \u201cWhatever we decide, it doesn\u2019t need to be this very minute. We\u2019ll take things one day at a time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Justine sighed and rubbed her bare foot along the outside of his leg. \u201cI was so afraid I was going to lose you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI would never have let that happen.\u201d</p> <p>And yet Justine feared it almost had.</p><p>Fifteen</p><p>Allison Cox checked the address and space number a second time, uncertain whether she had the right trailer house. Anson had never told her which one he and his mother lived in. When she\u2019d asked the manager, the woman had pointed to the back of the park, saying, \u201cCherry\u2019s at the end. Space fifteen. When you see her, tell her the rent payment\u2019s past due, would ya?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d</p><p>The woman had frowned. \u201cForget it, kid. I\u2019ll deal with her myself.\u201d</p><p>With more than a little trepidation, Allison walked up the rickety steps of number fifteen. The thought of Anson living in this poor excuse for a home nearly broke her heart. After a brief hesitation, she knocked at the thin door.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d the woman inside shouted.</p><p>\u201cAllison Cox.\u201d She spoke as loudly as she could without yelling.</p> <p>The door slowly opened. Dressed in a housecoat, Anson\u2019s mother stood on the other side of the screen door, holding a cigarette. Her hair was lank and dirty, and it looked as if she hadn\u2019t been out for a while.</p><p>\u201cWho are you and what do you want?\u201d she demanded. One arm was tucked around her waist; ash fell to the floor when she flicked her cigarette with the other hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a friend of Anson\u2019s,\u201d Allison explained. \u201cI...\u201d She lowered her voice in case someone was listening. \u201cHe phoned me and I thought you might want to hear how he\u2019s doing.\u201d</p><p>Anson\u2019s mother laughed as though the statement amused her. \u201cSure,\u201d she said, unlocking the screen. \u201cCome on in and tell me what you know about the little bastard.\u201d</p><p>Allison flinched at the word and resisted the urge to retaliate. If Anson was a bastard, then that woman was responsible for it. Biting her tongue, Allison stepped inside. The trailer was in shocking disarray. The kitchen sink was piled with dirty dishes and the countertops covered with junk. The living room obviously hadn\u2019t been picked up in months.</p><p>There was a stale, musty smell\u2014smoke, spilled booze, judging by the rye bottle lying on its side, and just...dirt. The smell of squalor. \u201cExcuse the place,\u201d Cherry said with a dismissive gesture. \u201cIt\u2019s the maid\u2019s day off.\u201d</p><p>Allison smiled weakly at the woman\u2019s attempted joke.</p><p>Cherry shoved a stack of trashy grocery store magazines from one of the chairs, indicating Allison should sit there. \u201cWhere\u2019s he at?\u201d she demanded before even Allison had a chance to sit down.</p><p>\u201cHe, uh, didn\u2019t say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell him the sheriff\u2019s looking for him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no...He already seemed to know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s goin\u2019 to prison this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Butler, Anson didn\u2019t set that fire.\u201d</p><p>The woman snickered. \u201cFirst off, I ain\u2019t never been a Mrs. anybody, and second you and I both know Anson did it. You don\u2019t need to pretend for my sake, sweetie. My son likes fires. He nearly burned the house down when he was six years old playin\u2019 with matches. When he was ten, he and a group of his little friends started a brush fire that got me in a whole lot of trouble. Next thing I knew, Child Protective Services are all over my ass like I was the one who lit that match.\u201d She paused and inhaled deeply on the cigarette, then smashed it out in a glass ashtray overflowing with ashes and crumpled butts. \u201cLast year he gets himself in real trouble by burning down that toolshed in the park. Far as I\u2019m concerned, he\u2019s just building bigger fires. It started when he was a kid and it hasn\u2019t stopped.\u201d When she finished, she walked over to the refrigerator and opened it. \u201cWant a beer?\u201d</p><p>Allison slowly exhaled. \u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>Anson\u2019s mother grabbed a bottle, twisted off the cap and took a swig. \u201cProblem is,\u201d she said without looking at Allison, \u201cI never was mother material.\u201d</p><p>Allison didn\u2019t say anything, although she definitely agreed.</p><p>\u201cYou say he called you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he want?\u201d</p><p>Allison hated the implication. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want anything. He said he needed to hear the sound of my voice. He told me he didn\u2019t start the fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you believe him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell the sheriff he phoned you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Technically she hadn\u2019t. It was her mother who\u2019d contacted Sheriff Davis.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she said and nodded approvingly. \u201cIf he calls you again, don\u2019t, okay?\u201d</p><p>Allison couldn\u2019t promise one way or the other, so she didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cHe wrote me,\u201d Cherry said, shaking another cigarette out of the pack.</p><p>Allison sat up. \u201cYou have an address?\u201d she asked excitedly.</p><p>\u201cI wish. Little bastard owes me money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I see the letter?\u201d Allison pleaded.</p><p>His mother shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s around here somewhere.\u201d She walked over to the toaster and sorted through a tall stack of flyers and bills until she found what she was looking for. She held the envelope out to Allison.</p><p>Allison stood, but before she could take it, Cherry yanked it out of her reach. \u201cYou ain\u2019t gonna mention this to the cops, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Allison promised, her heart in her throat.</p><p>Cherry gave her the letter.</p><p>Sitting down, Allison removed the single sheet from the envelope and read.</p><p>Dear Mom,</p><p>I asked a friend to mail this for me. Don\u2019t try to trace me because I\u2019m not anywhere close to where this letter is postmarked.</p><p>Allison stopped reading and examined the envelope, which had a Louisiana postmark. She hated that he was so far away and hoped what he said was true.</p><p>I know you\u2019re probably mad because I took the money out of the freezer. There was almost five hundred dollars there. I counted it and as soon as I can, I\u2019ll pay you back every penny. I know you were saving that money to fix the transmission on the car. I wouldn\u2019t have taken it if I\u2019d had any other choice.</p><p>If you\u2019re done being mad, then there\u2019s something else I want to tell you. I didn\u2019t start that fire.</p><p>This was underlined several times.</p><p>I\u2019ve done a lot of stupid stuff in my life but I didn\u2019t do this. Believe me or not...that\u2019s up to you.</p><p>I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to write you again so consider this an IOU for the money\u2014$497.36.</p><p>Take care of yourself, and if you\u2019re smart you\u2019ll get rid of that guy you think looks like Tobey Maguire. He\u2019s a piss-poor imitation.</p><p>Anson</p><p>Allison replaced the letter in the envelope. \u201cAnson borrowed almost five hundred dollars from you?\u201d she asked softly. That explained why he didn\u2019t need any money. Yet it\u2019d been weeks since she\u2019d seen him. That money couldn\u2019t have lasted long.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t borrow anything. He stole it,\u201d Cherry said, puffing on a new cigarette. \u201cI\u2019m never gonna see that cash again. It\u2019s gone and so is Donald.\u201d She took a crumpled tissue from her housecoat pocket and blew her nose. \u201cAnd he did too look like Tobey Maguire.\u201d</p><p>She seemed more upset about Donald than her own son, Allison mused.</p><p>\u201cAnson was nothing but trouble to me from the day he was born,\u201d Cherry said, suddenly angry. \u201cIt would\u2019ve been a whole lot better if he\u2019d been a girl. I knew the minute that nurse told me I\u2019d had a boy this wasn\u2019t gonna work. But as soon as I saw him, I knew I was gonna keep him.\u201d She shrugged her shoulders and took another puff. \u201cThe kid would have done a hell of a lot better if I\u2019d given him to that lady from the state. She said she had a home ready and waitin\u2019. But I wouldn\u2019t listen to her. Oh, no. I figured this kid came from me and that he\u2019d love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnson does love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right,\u201d she muttered. \u201cThat\u2019s why he did what every man I ever loved did. He left and took something of mine with him. In his case, it was that five hundred bucks. He might as well have taken my car for all the good it\u2019s doing me with a busted transmission.\u201d She ground out the half-smoked cigarette. \u201cNot that five hundred bucks would\u2019ve paid for a new one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDespite what he did, Anson\u2019s a wonderful person,\u201d Allison felt obliged to tell her. \u201cAnd he\u2019s smart, too. He\u2019s really good in languages and science. He could\u2019ve gotten top grades.\u201d</p><p>His mother blinked as if this came as a surprise, and then shook her head. \u201cThe problem is, he\u2019s a man. I never could hold on to one. His own daddy dumped me soon as I got pregnant and then disappeared. I found out later he was married, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well he wasn\u2019t my first mistake or my last.\u201d She gulped down another swallow of beer. \u201cYou go ahead and believe in Anson if you want,\u201d she said, giving Allison a shaky smile. \u201cHe needs someone who will. I don\u2019t believe in myself anymore, so I don\u2019t have it in me to believe in him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love Anson,\u201d Allison admitted.</p><p>Cherry looked away for a moment, and Allison thought she saw the sheen of tears in her eyes. When Cherry looked back, she pointed the bottle at her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTime for you to go.\u201d</p><p>Allison nodded. \u201cAll right.\u201d On impulse, she opened her purse and took out a small pad.

Ben was playing bridge with some other men, and then later Charlotte would meet him for soup at the Pot Belly Deli, one of her favorite lunch spots. Their homemade soups were not to be missed. However, she\u2019d promised Helen Shelton a quick visit before lunch. Her friend was working on a Fair Isle sweater for her only granddaughter and wanted Charlotte to take a look. At one time or another, Charlotte had tackled just about every type of project in the knitting world, and Fair Isle was no exception. Helen found this sweater a challenge; Charlotte admired the way she\u2019d refused to give up, although she\u2019d had to restart more than once before she figured out the correct tension.</p><p>Charlotte and Helen were both widows. They\u2019d begun as casual acquaintances, but their friendship had grown through their involvement in the Senior Center. Now Charlotte considered Helen one of her dearest friends. She knew Helen had been in France during World War II, but only recently had she learned that Helen had been part of the French Resistance. This information came to her by accident, when Charlotte happened to see a faded poster while visiting her friend. She\u2019d asked about it and then, reluctantly, as though every word had to be forced out, Helen explained that as a young college student, she\u2019d been trapped in France after the German invasion.</p><p>Determined to support the Allies, she\u2019d joined the French Resistance, helping downed American and English pilots find their way back to England. Although Charlotte had tried to ask further questions, Helen sidestepped them. Instinctively Charlotte had realized that her friend didn\u2019t want this information shared. The only person she\u2019d ever told was Ben. The friendship between Helen and Charlotte had deepened from that day forward.</p> <p>Helen met her at the door of her duplex and immediately ushered her inside and out of the drizzle. No one used umbrellas in the Pacific Northwest\u2014or residents didn\u2019t, anyway. An umbrella was a sure sign of a tourist.</p><p>Now, as she sat in Helen\u2019s living room with a cup of tea, Charlotte examined the body of the sweater, which was knit in the round. This was the method Charlotte had recommended and it seemed to be working well.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all in the tension,\u201d Charlotte said, looking closely at Helen\u2019s knitting. She nodded. \u201cNice job.\u201d Holding a strand of yarn in each hand was a learned skill, but one grew accustomed to it quickly enough. \u201cRuth\u2019s going to be thrilled when she sees this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI certainly hope so,\u201d Helen said, shaking her head. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you the number of rows I\u2019ve had to take out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing just fine.\u201d</p><p>Helen set her tea aside. \u201cRuth\u2019s engaged\u2014did I tell you?\u2014and I\u2019m thinking of knitting something for her wedding.\u201d</p> <p>Since Helen was already knitting her granddaughter this difficult sweater, Charlotte was loath to suggest a wedding coat, which was meant to be worn over the wedding dress following the ceremony. She\u2019d come upon a 1970s pattern for one and was quite taken with it. Perhaps she\u2019d find an excuse to knit it up herself.</p><p>\u201cLet me look through my patterns to see what I can dig up,\u201d Charlotte said.</p><p>Helen thanked her with a smile. \u201cI\u2019d appreciate that. Any suggestions are welcome.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte finished her tea and bade her friend an affectionate farewell, promising another visit soon. She put on her raincoat, collected her large purse and stepped into the May drizzle. With gas prices what they were, Charlotte had decided to walk. Fortunately the Garden Club meeting room, Helen\u2019s duplex and the deli were located only a few blocks apart.</p><p>By the time she arrived at the Pot Belly Deli, Ben had secured a table and was reading the menu. As soon as her husband saw her enter, he stood, giving her a discreet kiss on the cheek and helped her remove her coat. The fact that Ben exhibited such impeccable manners had endeared him to her from the very start. Such courtesies didn\u2019t play much of a role in social relationships anymore, so when they existed, she felt they were often indicative of real respect. In Ben\u2019s case that was definitely true. Those protective, caring gestures\u2014opening a door, helping her into a car, walking on the curb side of the street\u2014touched her. She and Ben believed in treating each other with politeness and consideration. Her first marriage, to Clyde, had been marked by those same small displays of love.</p><p>\u201cHow did the meeting go?\u201d Ben asked after seating her and reclaiming his own chair.</p><p>Charlotte was afraid he\u2019d ask. \u201cI was elected president again,\u201d she said with a slight grimace. \u201cEveryone\u2019s so busy these days, and no one else wanted the position.\u201d The Garden Club didn\u2019t require a lot of her time, but it was a monthly commitment that took her away from him.</p><p>His lack of response unsettled her. \u201cAre you upset with me, dear?\u201d</p> <p>Ben lowered the menu and his eyes widened at her question. \u201cWhy would I be upset? If I were a Garden Club member, I\u2019d want you as president, too. You\u2019re the perfect choice. You\u2019re organized, practical, responsible\u2014and the most incredible woman I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p><p>The things this man said. Things that made her heart expand with joy. \u201cOh, Ben, I do love you.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, he set the menu aside. \u201cI know, and I consider myself the most fortunate of men because you do.\u201d</p><p>They both ordered the chicken-and-wild-rice soup, with large chunks of warm-from-the-oven sourdough bread. The restaurant owner had once told Charlotte that the sourdough starter had come from Alaska and was more than a hundred years old. Whether or not the story was true, the bread did have a flavor that couldn\u2019t be matched.</p><p>\u201cI stopped by the house before I came down to the deli,\u201d Ben told her as they got ready to leave. \u201cJustine phoned and asked if we could see her at the bank before one.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte had heard only a few days ago that her granddaughter had gone back to work for First National part-time. Justine had served as manager until shortly after her wedding to Seth. She sincerely hoped the young couple wasn\u2019t having financial problems, although she didn\u2019t think so. Olivia had told her that Justine and Seth were getting interim insurance payments. She had the feeling that her granddaughter had returned to the bank more to structure her time than for financial reasons. Justine had never been a girl who liked being idle.</p><p>After their bill was paid, Ben helped Charlotte on with her coat and together they left the deli. Although she\u2019d enjoyed their lunch, Charlotte missed The Lighthouse. It had become a popular place in the community and she was so proud of everything Justine and Seth had done. Any meal there was a notable dining experience. She couldn\u2019t begin to understand why anyone would burn it down. She had to believe it\u2019d been a random act of violence. Surely no one would wish her granddaughter and Seth any harm.</p><p>Perhaps because this was a Monday, the bank didn\u2019t seem too busy. Justine sat behind a desk set against the far wall and stood when she saw them.</p><p>\u201cHello, Grandma,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cBen.\u201d She came forward to meet them and kissed Charlotte\u2019s cheek, then led them toward her desk. \u201cSit down, please.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte couldn\u2019t remember her granddaughter calling her into the bank even once. There must be some problem with Justine\u2019s finances, after all. Her gaze seemed to avoid Charlotte\u2019s, as if she was embarrassed about something.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, dear?\u201d Charlotte asked, holding her purse on her lap and leaning forward in the chair.</p><p>\u201cBen,\u201d Justine said, looking directly at him. \u201cYou deposited a check for a thousand dollars a while back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was from David, his son,\u201d Charlotte explained before Ben had a chance. Although he hadn\u2019t said anything, she knew Ben had been pleased with David\u2019s gesture in repaying him part of the money he owed. Father and son were estranged, and Charlotte had done her best to bring them together. Ben didn\u2019t discourage her efforts, yet she had the distinct feeling that he thought it was a waste of time. Certainly David was a problem child.</p><p>\u201cThe check was returned\u2014insufficient funds,\u201d Justine said, keeping her voice low. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. As soon as I saw the name, I took the check and handled it myself.\u201d</p><p>Ben remained stoic. \u201cThe truth is, I\u2019m not surprised. Could I have it, please?\u201d</p><p>Justine handed it to him and without so much as glancing at it, Ben tore it in two.</p><p>\u201cBen!\u201d Charlotte was shocked at her husband\u2019s action. \u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s a logical explanation for why this happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s worthless,\u201d her husband said without emotion. \u201cI should\u2019ve known that from the first. David\u2019s had constant financial problems from the time he was a youth. He\u2019s never been able to repay me a dime he\u2019s borrowed. That\u2019s why I refuse to lend him money anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear,\u201d Charlotte murmured, genuinely saddened by this turn of events.</p><p>\u201cHis lack of financial sense is the reason he went to Charlotte for a loan, which infuriated me more than just about anything David\u2019s ever done in his life,\u201d Ben continued.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t let money stand in the way of love,\u201d Charlotte admonished. She made sure her tone was without censure.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t misunderstand me,\u201d Ben said, his words weighted with sadness. \u201cI love my sons, both of them. David, however, has never grown up or learned to accept responsibility. It\u2019s always someone else\u2019s fault, always a temporary condition. Everything will be better later, and instead of facing the truth, he looks for an easy out or a quick fix. His immaturity has cost him deeply, and his excuses have only led him further into debt.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte placed her hand on her husband\u2019s. \u201cYou aren\u2019t to blame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made a call to David Rhodes,\u201d Justine said, interrupting their conversation.</p><p>Charlotte turned her attention back to her granddaughter.</p><p>Justine seemed decidedly uncomfortable. \u201cDavid asked if I\u2019d hold the check until the first of the month, which I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when you resubmitted it, the same thing happened. It was returned because of insufficient funds,\u201d Ben finished for her.</p><p>Justine confirmed his suspicions with a nod. \u201cI couldn\u2019t hold on to it any longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Ben assured her with such a facade of calm that even Charlotte was nearly fooled. She, however, knew her husband far too well\u2014and knew that Ben was both embarrassed and unsettled. \u201cPlease, if anything like this ever comes up in the future, do not do my son any favors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ben,\u201d Justine said sympathetically. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Ben got to his feet.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Justine, for letting us know,\u201d Charlotte said. With a polite nod, Ben took her arm.</p><p>\u201cWe should phone David,\u201d Charlotte suggested as they left the bank. She still felt there must be some kind of explanation. She had to believe that or she\u2019d give up on Ben\u2019s son the same way he had, which was exactly what she wanted to avoid. To Charlotte, it was important to build good relationships with Ben\u2019s children.</p><p>When they got home, Ben excused himself and went into the bedroom. The urge to follow him left Charlotte\u2019s stomach in knots. She knew how bad he felt and wished she could alleviate his disappointment. At the same time, she recognized that he needed to be alone.</p> <p>As she walked into the kitchen, the answering machine light was flickering. She pushed the message button and heard David Rhodes, speaking clearly and distinctly. \u201cDad, give me a call once you\u2019re home.\u201d</p><p>As soon as the message had finished, Ben entered the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Ben nodded.</p><p>\u201cWill you phone him?\u201d</p> <p>Her husband shook his head adamantly. \u201cThere\u2019s no point. I already know what he wants.\u201d</p><p>So did Charlotte. Surely David had phoned to apologize. He wouldn\u2019t be foolish enough to ask for another loan. This situation must be just as embarrassing for his son as it had been for Ben.</p><p>The phone rang and Ben glared at it accusingly.</p><p>\u201cShall I answer it?\u201d Charlotte asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ben snapped. \u201cIt\u2019s David.\u201d Then, as if realizing how harshly he\u2019d spoken, he gathered Charlotte into his arms. \u201cMy son can\u2019t say anything that I haven\u2019t heard a hundred times before. He\u2019s sorry\u2014and I believe he is\u2014but it never makes any difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Ben.\u201d Charlotte understood; she really did. It was almost as if Ben was talking about her son, Will. David had been careless with money, Will with people\u2019s affections. Women\u2019s affections. Charlotte knew the kind of man he was and yet she chose to look the other way and ignore his faults. A mother did that. She wasn\u2019t sure what else to do, even now that his marriage had failed. She didn\u2019t feel it was her place to interfere between a man and his wife. Yet Charlotte knew that not only had her son been unfaithful, he\u2019d taken advantage of Grace, a woman almost as close to her as her own daughter. Yes, she acknowledged that Grace had played a role in this, too, but she blamed her son far more than she did Grace.</p> <p>No one had told her what had gone on between them; no one needed to. She\u2019d figured out that it was Will with whom Grace had been involved over the Internet. Her married son had led that lovely woman down a path of promises he had no intention of keeping, and to her detriment, Grace had followed him. Now Will\u2019s own marriage was in shambles and he was blaming Georgia, the woman who\u2019d stood by him all these years. No, Charlotte understood far better than Ben realized what a disappointment one\u2019s children could sometimes be.</p><p>Seventeen</p><p>Since Easter, almost two weeks ago, Linnette had barely spoken to Cal. He\u2019d joined her and her family, sat with them, talked with them and then as casually as could be announced that he was leaving for Wyoming on some wild goose\u2014correction, wild horse\u2014chase.</p><p>He didn\u2019t seem to have noticed how upset she was. In fact, at the time, Linnette had been too unnerved to do more than make a token protest. Since Easter, though, she\u2019d given a great deal of thought to the situation. It\u2019d taken her this long to work up the courage to confront Cal and let him know her feelings. If he was serious about their relationship, the same way she was, then the least he could do was discuss this with her.</p><p>She\u2019d been working long hours at the clinic to cover for colleagues on vacation. She\u2019d left two messages on his answering machine, and he hadn\u2019t answered either one. Of course, he was busy, but so was she. Yes, she knew that several of the mares were pregnant and that he was training a couple of yearlings. But what about her work commitments? Anyway, even if she wasn\u2019t very familiar with horse ranching she remembered that Cliff raised quarter horses, not mustangs. She didn\u2019t understand his and Cal\u2019s sudden interest in an entirely different breed of horse. Her only option was to talk to Cal, face to face. She\u2019d explain her position and beg him to give up this crazy notion.</p><p>On the long drive out to Olalla, she smiled as she recalled how her sister, Gloria, had teased her, calling it Oo-la-la once she\u2019d seen Cal. Linnette had talked to her about this situation, and Gloria had agreed with her decision, cautioning her to stay calm, stay focused. That had offended Linnette just a little, since she saw herself as calm and clearheaded. But she was grateful for Gloria\u2019s go-ahead.</p><p>Linnette hadn\u2019t given Cal any advance warning. The idea of driving to Wyoming by himself, especially now that he was doing so well with his speech therapy, troubled her. She didn\u2019t want to give him an opportunity to come up with rationalizations and trumped-up reasons, either.</p><p>The least Cal could\u2019ve done was present his plan to her, so they could talk it over before he made a decision. He hadn\u2019t considered her feelings at all, and that hurt. She\u2019d finally realized why this whole idea of his bothered her as much as it did. Ultimately it came down to the fact that she\u2019d played no part in it.</p> <p>When she arrived at the ranch, she didn\u2019t immediately see Cal. Various horses milled around the fenced pasture to her right. She wasn\u2019t sure exactly how many Cliff owned now\u2014several dozen as far as she could tell. On previous visits Linnette had learned the names of a few of them. Cliff\u2019s stallion was called Midnight, and the brown-and-white yearling cavorting around the pasture closest to the fence was Funny Face. And there was Sheba, of course, the mare she\u2019d ridden a few weeks ago.</p><p>When she\u2019d parked and left her car, Cliff was emerging from the barn. He was a good-looking man, probably older than her parents, with a striking, vital presence. She thought he looked better than he ever had, and being a romantic, Linnette felt sure the difference was due to his marriage.</p><p>\u201cHi, Linnette,\u201d Cliff said as he came closer. He led a big dark-brown horse who stomped and snorted, making her nervous. She saw that the animal was already saddled. \u201cCal didn\u2019t say you were coming by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know.\u201d She turned toward the corral and saw Cal standing there, a rope in his hands. The animal apparently recognized his intentions and whirled to avoid him.</p><p>Linnette watched, fascinated, as Cal expertly spun the lasso, all the while moving slowly toward the horse. With an ease that seemed entirely natural, he tossed the rope. His aim was true, and the lasso settled around the horse\u2019s neck. The stallion suddenly reared up, pawing frantically in the air. Linnette gasped and covered her eyes.</p><p>Cliff touched her shoulder in a reassuring gesture, and Linnette made an effort not to step apprehensively aside as the black horse thrust its neck toward her. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine. Cal\u2019s working with a new stallion I just bought. He wouldn\u2019t do anything that might hurt the horse or himself.\u201d</p><p>When she found the courage to look again, she saw Cal standing in the corral, the stallion now backing away from the restraint. He kicked up dirt and reared again.</p><p>An involuntary sound of protest came from her lips as she rushed to the fence. She stared in horror as Cal went down. Cliff stood there, watching, too, and she wondered why he didn\u2019t seem more worried about the fact that Cal knelt on the ground, hunched over as if in pain.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine,\u201d Cliff assured her again. And as she looked intently at Cal, she saw him get up, still holding the rope. Her heart was in her throat as he shortened the distance between the stallion and himself, speaking quietly to the massive horse.</p><p>Linnette stared in amazement as he neared the animal and, after a few minutes, ran his hand down the sleek, sweat-drenched neck. She couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d managed to do that\u2014or that the stallion was allowing it.</p><p>Linnette didn\u2019t understand what had just happened. All she knew was that she had to get to Cal\u2014talk to him. Find out for herself that he was all right. Despite herself, she was impressed that he\u2019d subdued the stallion so quickly.</p><p>She climbed the fence and swung her leg over the top rung when Cliff stopped her.</p><p>\u201cStay here,\u201d he ordered. \u201cCal will be back in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>Sure enough, as soon as he\u2019d slipped a halter on the stallion and led him into the barn, he joined Linnette and Cliff. He was frowning slightly. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he asked. She noticed that he hadn\u2019t greeted her or expressed any pleasure at seeing her.</p><p>\u201cI came to talk,\u201d she said. Her heart was still racing. Cal\u2019s world was so different from her own, she reminded herself. So filled with risks and dangers that were commonplace to him, but completely foreign to her.</p><p>When he didn\u2019t respond, she couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said brusquely. Then he seemed to relent a bit. \u201cI\u2019m perfectly fine,\u201d he said in a friendlier tone.</p><p>\u201cBut...you could\u2019ve been injured! What if that horse had kicked you? Or stomped on you? Or...or...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t, did he?\u201d</p><p>In the back of her mind she registered that he\u2019d spoken without stammering or hesitation. \u201cWhy do you take these kinds of risks?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t seem to realize how badly she\u2019d been shaken by seeing him in danger. Her knees would barely support her.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Cal said, ignoring her question. He slipped an arm around her waist as he drew her away from Cliff. \u201cLet\u2019s talk, since that\u2019s why you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to go,\u201d she blurted out. \u201cI know you feel you\u2019re doing something noble and good but is it really necessary? And doesn\u2019t this seem like a bad time?\u201d She was afraid he hadn\u2019t considered all the consequences of leaving. \u201cYou\u2019re doing so well with your speech therapy...and...and you said yourself that there are mares ready to deliver. Surely Cliff needs you.\u201d Desperately she looked in the other man\u2019s direction, but Cliff had already mounted the brown horse and galloped off, giving her and Cal privacy. \u201cAnd what about me?\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cCliff\u2019s encouraging me to go,\u201d he said patiently. \u201cMy speech therapist thinks it\u2019s fine.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI need to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my life, L-Linnette,\u201d he said and for the first time his voice faltered slightly. \u201cI make my own decisions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you do.\u201d She was astounded\u2014and frightened\u2014by the intensity of his declaration.</p><p>\u201cP-perhaps I sh-should\u2019ve told you earlier. Actually, it\u2019s been in the works for some t-time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>He removed his hat and wiped his forearm across his brow. \u201cBecause I knew you were going to object, so I k-kept putting it off. You\u2019re right\u2014I should\u2019ve said something sooner, but I\u2019m telling you now. L-like I said, this is important to me, and I\u2019m going with or without your approval.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she murmured, backing down with a sigh of resignation. Nothing she said was going to make any difference at this point.</p><p>\u201cGood. Then we\u2019re clear on that.\u201d His voice was devoid of expression.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you could explain why this is so important to you,\u201d she suggested.</p><p>Together, but not touching, they walked over to the fence. Leaning against it, Cal braced his boot on the bottom rung. \u201cMustangs are being trapped by the Bureau of Land Management and because of a t-t-technicality in the law, once they\u2019re sold, too many of them are being slaughtered.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019d mentioned some of this when he\u2019d visited on Easter Sunday. She hadn\u2019t paid much attention to the details, though.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked. \u201cHow can they do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnited States law allows mustangs over the age of ten to be sold \u2018without limitations,\u2019\u201d he explained.</p><p>\u201cIn other words,\u201d she said, \u201cthey\u2019re being caught and sold and whoever buys them can do what they want with these horses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTh-that\u2019s what\u2019s happening, yes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they\u2019re being killed,\u201d Linnette argued.</p><p>\u201cI wish you were right. Unfortunately that\u2019s not the case. These beautiful beasts are being used for dog food here in the States or sold for human consumption in Europe.\u201d</p><p>That couldn\u2019t be true. It just couldn\u2019t. Although she knew little about horses, she was reluctant to accept that the government would allow this kind of senseless slaughter.</p><p>Several minutes passed in silence before Cal turned to look at her. \u201cCan you understand why this is so important to me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Linnette did understand. What she didn\u2019t grasp was why Cal had to go. He was only one person and there wasn\u2019t much he could do by himself.</p><p>She pressed a finger to Cal\u2019s lips. Her eyes filled with tears and she couldn\u2019t see him clearly. \u201cHow long?\u201d she asked, speaking around the knot in her throat. \u201cHow long will you be gone?\u201d She wanted him to hold her, reassure her, but he didn\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cA month, six weeks at the most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you intend to do with the mustangs?\u201d She wiped away her tears with the sleeve of her sweater.</p><p>\u201cThere are various agencies that adopt them out. Like I told your family at Easter, I\u2019ll be volunteering with the BLM and working with one of the agencies. Once the horses are captured and checked for health problems, they\u2019re available for adoption or auctioned off. I\u2019ll buy a few for Cliff and me, and I\u2019ll help the wild horse rescue group in whatever way they need.\u201d A smile slowly emerged. \u201cI\u2019ll do everything I can to prevent even a few of them from being sold for slaughter.\u201d</p><p>Unwilling to wait for him to make the first move, Linnette threw her arms around his neck and rested her head against his shoulder. \u201cWhat about us?\u201d she asked. She could hear a distant truck, growing louder as it approached.</p><p>Cal stroked her hair with tenderness. Although his touch was gentle, an uneasy feeling refused to leave her. Something had changed between them, and she didn\u2019t know what. Or why.</p><p>Just then, the truck she\u2019d heard rolled into the yard. Cal dropped his arms and stepped away from her.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThe vet.\u201d</p> <p>Vicki Newman climbed out of the pickup and headed toward them, striding like a movie cowboy. Linnette had never met the other woman, although her name routinely came into conversations. She often stopped by the ranch for one reason or another. These horses seemed to require constant medical attention, Linnette thought, unable to curb her cynicism.</p><p>Placing his hand lightly on her shoulder, Cal made the introductions.</p><p>Vicki Newman nodded and held her gaze. She wasn\u2019t attractive or even very feminine looking, Linnette noted critically. Her light-brown hair was long and severely tied back, which sharpened her features. She wore jeans and a faded shirt.</p><p>\u201cNice to finally meet you,\u201d Vicki said.</p><p>\u201cYou, too,\u201d Linnette told her. After an awkward moment, she realized she was in the way. Whatever business they had to conduct, she clearly wasn\u2019t needed. \u201cI, ah, guess I\u2019d better get home.\u201d</p><p>Cal walked her to her car and kissed her cheek. As she drove away, Linnette glanced back and saw Cal and Vicki with their heads together, talking. It intensified the anxiety that roiled in her stomach.</p><p>Eighteen</p><p>\u201cCome on, Olivia,\u201d Jack shouted over his shoulder as he jogged several paces ahead of her on Lighthouse Road. Fortunately traffic was light for a Saturday afternoon.</p><p>\u201cJack,\u201d she panted, struggling to keep up. \u201cSlow down.\u201d She\u2019d never thought she\u2019d see the day that Jack Griffin could outrun her. But now that he was down thirty pounds and working out regularly, he\u2019d become an exercise convert. His heart attack had been the motivation\u2014and the warning\u2014that he needed.</p><p>Trying to catch up, Olivia trotted along, breathing hard by the time she reached his side. \u201cHow much farther?\u201d she panted.</p><p>\u201cAround the next corner is three full miles.\u201d</p><p>As soon as they rounded the curve in the road, Olivia stopped, slumping against the speed limit sign, exhausted. She leaned forward to catch her breath. \u201cI can\u2019t keep up with you anymore,\u201d she said, gulping air into her lungs.</p><p>Jogging in place, Jack looked exceptionally proud of himself. \u201cYou might want to lose a few pounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack!\u201d She straightened and glared at him, hands on her hips.</p><p>\u201cJust kidding,\u201d he said, chuckling.</p><p>\u201cNo, you weren\u2019t.\u201d The thing was, she probably could afford to lose five pounds. Except that at her age, it wasn\u2019t as easy as it had once been. Despite all her hard work, those few stubborn pounds refused to budge. It would be easier to melt them off with a blowtorch, as she\u2019d recently told Grace.</p><p>Grace and Olivia were back to meeting every Wednesday for their aerobics class. Afterward they went for pie and coffee at the Pancake Palace. However, Olivia had forsaken dessert in the last few weeks. But she might as well have indulged in that coconut cream delight for all the good it\u2019d done her to go without.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking we should take a nice, hot shower when we get home,\u201d Jack suggested, jogging circles around her. He jiggled his eyebrows suggestively.</p><p>\u201cJack Griffin, you\u2019re outrageous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you love it.\u201d</p><p>He was right; she loved everything about this man.</p><p>After being single for nearly twenty years, she\u2019d had to make a real adjustment to return to married life. Jack had been divorced for almost as long, and he\u2019d had to make his own compromises.</p><p>It had taken Jack\u2019s heart attack to show her\u2014remind her\u2014what really mattered in life and in marriage. She loved her husband. That fact was immutable; everything else was negotiable.</p><p>She only hoped that her daughter\u2019s marriage was equally strong, equally capable of surviving a crisis.</p><p>They started the three-mile walk back to the house, their pace more leisurely than before.</p><p>\u201cOh, oh,\u201d Jack said after a moment. \u201cYou\u2019ve got that look. Better tell me what you\u2019re thinking about.\u201d</p><p>Olivia sighed and supposed she should get straight to the point. \u201cJustine mentioned that Warren Saget\u2019s been coming by the bank a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t surprise me,\u201d Jack muttered. He shared her distaste for the other man.</p><p>Her daughter\u2019s relationship with Warren had always made Olivia uncomfortable, and her disapproval had driven a wedge between them for a long time. Good grief! Warren was Olivia\u2019s age, old enough to be Justine\u2019s father. In fact, Olivia had worried that her daughter was seeking a father figure in him. Stan had been a good husband and father until their son\u2019s death. Afterward, it was as if her ex had abdicated those roles. In retrospect, Olivia believed this was how Stan had dealt with Jordan\u2019s loss. Stan had remarried almost immediately after the divorce, and while he\u2019d continued with child support payments, he\u2019d had practically no emotional involvement with either Justine or her brother, James.</p><p>\u201cDid she tell you what Saget wants?\u201d Jack asked, frowning.</p><p>\u201cNot really. She just said he\u2019s making a lot of unnecessary visits to the bank. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s told Seth about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she should\u2014to avoid any misunderstandings.\u201d</p><p>Olivia agreed with him, but it wasn\u2019t her decision.</p><p>\u201cWarren knows Justine isn\u2019t interested in him, right?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>Justine had assured Olivia she\u2019d made that abundantly clear. \u201cShe loves her husband and family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t trust Warren Saget,\u201d Jack said, walking faster now. Olivia picked up her pace, too. \u201cJustine would be well advised to stay away from him,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you figure he\u2019s trying to get on her good side? Because he wants the contract to rebuild the restaurant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Olivia said, but she doubted it. Warren\u2019s company was successful, despite a number of complaints and even lawsuits through the years. Olivia had never understood how he stayed in business and yet he did. Warren had lost some of those lawsuits, and won others, and still he thrived.</p><p>What bothered Olivia most was the way he kept turning up in her daughter\u2019s life, like the proverbial bad penny. Olivia knew it\u2019d been hard on Warren\u2019s ego when Justine left him and married Seth. Five years had passed. Surely he was over her daughter by now.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear about Sandy Davis?\u201d Jack asked suddenly.</p><p>Olivia shook her head. Sandy was the sheriff\u2019s wife; she and Troy Davis had been married nearly thirty years. Sandy had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis as a young adult. She\u2019d spent the last two years in a nursing home.</p><p>\u201cShe died yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Olivia murmured. She\u2019d always admired Troy and the way he loved and cared for his wife. He rarely talked about Sandy or her condition, seldom disclosing his own troubles.</p><p>\u201cThe funeral\u2019s going to be low-key,\u201d Jack said. \u201cThat\u2019s what Troy and his daughter told me when he brought in the obituary. Pastor Flemming is doing the service.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor Troy,\u201d she said, wishing she could think of some way to help. \u201cWe\u2019ll definitely go to the funeral.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI let your mother know,\u201d Jack told her. \u201cCharlotte and the ladies at the Senior Center are organizing the wake. Most of them knew Sandy.\u201d</p><p>An involuntary smile came to Olivia. \u201cMy mother\u2019s so funny about these wakes. She claims that\u2019s where she finds her best recipes. The whole event becomes a recipe exchange.\u201d</p><p>Olivia expected Jack to be as amused as she was and glanced over at him to see that he wasn\u2019t smiling.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the way she handles losing her friends,\u201d her husband said. \u201cIf she can concentrate on something other than the fact that she\u2019s lost another friend, then she doesn\u2019t feel as bereft.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s insight didn\u2019t surprise her. He was skilled at recognizing the motivations beneath people\u2019s actions. \u201cWhen did you get so smart?\u201d she teased. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jack chuckled. \u201cAbout the time I married you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still interested in that shower?\u201d Olivia asked in a sultry voice as they neared the house.</p><p>\u201cYou bet I am.\u201d Her question added an extra bounce to his step.</p> <p>Olivia broke into an unhurried trot. \u201cWanna race?\u201d</p><p>Jack declined. \u201cI think I\u2019d better conserve my strength\u2014for later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent idea. Otherwise I might wear you out completely and I wouldn\u2019t want to do that.\u201d</p><p>Jack cast her a teasing, sexy look. \u201cOh, but I was hoping you\u2019d at least try.\u201d</p><p>Olivia couldn\u2019t keep from giggling like a schoolgirl. One of the great gifts of her marriage was laughter. Jack tended to see the humor in situations, even serious ones, and he could be a very clever mimic. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I ever did without you, Jack Griffin.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have anything planned for this evening, do we?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d Olivia hated to break this to him. \u201cActually, we do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do?\u201d Jack whined.</p><p>\u201cGrace and Cliff invited us to dinner to give Cal a nice send-off to Wyoming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe needs us to send him off?\u201d</p> <p>Olivia would rather stay home, too, but she\u2019d promised her friend. \u201cI told Grace we\u2019d be there.\u201d</p><p>Jack gave a deep, resigned sigh. \u201cWhat\u2019s Grace cooking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to need lots of incentives. Like her rib roast and those mashed potatoes she does.\u201d</p><p>They reached the house and Olivia jogged up the steps only to find Jack surging ahead of her. \u201cJack,\u201d she cried when he entered the house. He hadn\u2019t bothered to wait for her, either. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>He looked back, raising his eyebrows. \u201cTo turn on the shower, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Olivia echoed. \u201cI\u2019m right behind you.\u201d</p><p>Nineteen</p> <p>Ever since the phone call from Anson, Allison had been waiting, waiting for him to contact her again. It\u2019d been almost three weeks, and she was afraid she wouldn\u2019t hear from him a second time. As graduation grew closer, she hoped and prayed that the investigators would uncover something, anything, to prove his innocence.</p><p>\u201cDinner,\u201d her mother shouted from the kitchen. Allison reluctantly left her bedroom. After her parents had remarried, they\u2019d insisted on eating as a family every night. Sometimes, like this evening, Allison considered it a major pain, but mostly she enjoyed it. Silly though it sounded, eating together had brought them all closer. With everyone\u2019s hectic schedule, the habit had fallen by the wayside, and Allison hadn\u2019t thought she\u2019d really missed it. But if sitting down with her family at dinnertime helped keep her parents\u2019 marriage intact, she\u2019d do it.</p><p>Her mother had cooked Eddie\u2019s favorite meal tonight, spaghetti and meatballs. That should make her little brother happy, since food, computer games and basketball were his three passions. She remembered how much Anson liked Eddie and had even played basketball with him a few times.</p><p>Without being asked, Allison set the salad on the table and brought out two bottles of dressing from the refrigerator door. Her mother thanked her with a smile.</p><p>Her father sliced the French bread while Eddie sat at the table waiting. Typical boy attitude. Like it was his right to have everyone wait on him.</p><p>After saying grace, they passed everything around and Allison served herself some salad and just enough spaghetti to deter any comments or questions. Her appetite hadn\u2019t been good since Anson\u2019s disappearance and she\u2019d lost several pounds. Again and again she\u2019d reviewed their brief phone conversation. He\u2019d told her so little, for fear of putting himself at risk. The less she knew, the better. Allison understood that. Still, she couldn\u2019t help worrying about him.</p><p>\u201cHow was school?\u201d her mother asked.</p><p>Eddie shrugged, digging into his meal with unrestrained gusto. He was already taller than Allison and still growing. \u201cBor-ing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllison?\u201d Her mother turned to her.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I guess. I got accepted into the University of Washington.\u201d The letter had come that afternoon.</p><p>Her father set his fork down and stared at her. \u201cYou\u2019re only thinking to mention that now?\u201d</p><p>She nodded carelessly. \u201cI knew I\u2019d get in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch confidence,\u201d her mother said, looking at Zach with a smile.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations, Allison.\u201d Her father raised his water glass, and the others joined in the toast.</p><p>Really, Allison couldn\u2019t see what all the fuss was about. Both of her parents had attended UW and it was expected that she would, too. She\u2019d encouraged Anson to apply for a scholarship there, and if he\u2019d stayed in school, if he\u2019d pursued it, she was positive he would\u2019ve been accepted.</p><p>No one seemed to realize how intelligent Anson was. He picked up languages easily, as she\u2019d mentioned to his mother; he\u2019d also helped Allison get through her chemistry class. Without him she would barely have passed. All that stuff came to him with very little effort.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you, honey?\u201d her mother asked, directing the question to Zach.</p><p>\u201cI attended the Rotary meeting this afternoon and sat with Seth Gunderson.\u201d</p><p>Allison\u2019s ears perked up. She kept a file with whatever she could find out about the Gundersons, the restaurant and the fire. Obviously, she didn\u2019t possess the resources or the finesse of the authorities, but she collected every bit of information she could.</p><p>\u201cHow are Seth and his family doing now?\u201d her mother asked.</p><p>\u201cAll right, it seems. He\u2019s selling boats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoats?\u201d Eddie echoed, a smear of tomato sauce on his chin. \u201cThat\u2019s a switch, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. He was a fisherman before he went into the restaurant business,\u201d Zach explained.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Uninterested, Eddie returned to his meal.</p><p>\u201cApparently the arson investigators found a cross in the fire,\u201d her father added. \u201cThere was a picture of it in last night\u2019s paper. Seth hopes someone might recognize it and come forward.\u201d</p><p>Allison froze. She hadn\u2019t read yesterday\u2019s paper.</p><p>\u201cWhat an interesting twist.\u201d Her mother met Allison\u2019s gaze, and Allison didn\u2019t dare look away.</p><p>\u201cHas anyone come forward?\u201d she asked, her heart in her throat. Anson had worn a pewter cross. That didn\u2019t mean anything, she was quick to tell herself. \u201cBut whoever wore it might not be responsible for the fire,\u201d she said. \u201cIt could\u2019ve belonged to anyone, right?\u201d</p><p>Both her parents and Eddie stared at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you ask?\u201d her father asked, watching her intently.</p><p>Allison lowered her head and swallowed hard. \u201cNo reason,\u201d she mumbled. Only there was.... As soon as she could do it discreetly, she was going to find that newspaper and take a look.</p><p>No one at school had said anything about the article, not anyone, and Allison knew why. They were afraid to; afraid she\u2019d get defensive and angry the way she always did when anyone dared suggest Anson was involved in the fire.</p><p>When dinner was over, Allison escaped to the privacy of her bedroom. Her mother, who had an uncanny ability to read her moods, came to see her shortly afterward. She held the local newspaper.</p><p>Allison pretended not to notice.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to see the picture?\u201d her mother asked, sitting on the bed beside her.</p><p>Allison thought of lying and acting as if it didn\u2019t matter at all. Instead, she shrugged. \u201cI suppose,\u201d she said in a dispassionate voice.</p><p>\u201cAnson wore a big cross, didn\u2019t he?\u201d her mother asked gently.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not his,\u201d she said before she\u2019d even glanced at the photograph. \u201cAnd even if it is, that doesn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d</p><p>Her mother was slow in answering. \u201cIt might not. But then again, it might.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t do it, Mom,\u201d Allison insisted and although her mother didn\u2019t argue, Allison wondered who she was working so hard to convince\u2014her family or herself.</p><p>Her mother handed Allison the paper, which was open to the picture. One look, and Allison closed her eyes, so sick at heart that she couldn\u2019t bear to read the caption or the article below the photograph.</p><p>\u201cAnson wore a cross like this?\u201d her mother asked.</p><p>Allison bit her lower lip hard and nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou need to tell the sheriff you recognize it as his, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>A sob threatened to burst from her chest, but Allison managed to hold it back. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>Rosie slid her arm around Allison\u2019s shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Unable to speak, Allison nodded again. \u201cIt\u2019s not him,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not Anson.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t lie to her. He\u2019d told her he hadn\u2019t started the fire and she believed him.</p><p>After a moment, her mother stood and left the room. Allison remained on the edge of her bed. She had to think, to sort everything out. Whenever she least wanted to remember it, the conversation with his mother kept running through her mind.</p><p>Playing with matches. According to her, Anson had nearly burned the house down as a youngster. Later he\u2019d started a brush fire with friends and then there was the toolshed at the park. Fires fascinated him; his mother had been quick to tell her that. According to Cherry, he was just setting bigger ones now.</p><p>Even his own mother thought Anson was responsible for burning down The Lighthouse. The only person who still believed in him was Allison. And yet every shred of evidence she\u2019d collected pointed directly at him.</p><p>For the first time, her faith in Anson wavered. She wanted to believe, and prayed that he was innocent. But how could she maintain her faith in the face of everything she\u2019d learned?</p><p>The phone rang, and on the slight chance that it might be Anson, Allison leaped on it before Eddie could.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said, hoping she didn\u2019t sound as breathless as she felt.</p><p>\u201cAllison, it\u2019s Kaci. Did you get your acceptance from UW?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too. Want to go out and celebrate?\u201d</p><p>Allison didn\u2019t feel much like celebrating. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? You sound really down.\u201d</p><p>Kaci was Allison\u2019s best friend. \u201cAnson,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Allie, you\u2019ve got to stop pining for him. He\u2019s the one who walked out on you. Remember?\u201d</p><p>Allison didn\u2019t say anything, couldn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean that,\u201d Kaci said apologetically.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Allison assured her and then, because it all seemed so hard, she started to cry. \u201cOh, Kaci, I think he might\u2019ve done it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way! Hold on, I\u2019m coming over.\u201d</p><p>Before Allison could protest, the line was disconnected.</p><p>Ten minutes later, the doorbell rang. Allison didn\u2019t go out to greet her friend. If her parents saw her tears, they\u2019d be asking questions and she couldn\u2019t cope with that right now. Kaci let herself into Allison\u2019s room and immediately flopped down on the bed. \u201cAll right, talk.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Instead of speaking, she handed the newspaper to her friend. By now, Allison had read the short article two or three times. The cross had been found in the hallway outside the restaurant office and near the kitchen. Apparently it had fallen into a crack in the wood floor, protecting it from the worst of the fire.</p><p>Kaci read the piece and then set it aside. \u201cIs it Anson\u2019s? He wore one identical to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you he came to me the night of the fire,\u201d Allison said, keeping her voice low.</p><p>Kaci leaned closer.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I didn\u2019t tell you was that Anson smelled of smoke.\u201d</p><p>As though horrified, Kaci pressed her hand over her mouth. Allison hadn\u2019t confided in anyone except Cecilia, whose silence she could trust. \u201cI...I\u2019d never seen Anson like he was that night. I asked him what he did\u2014I was sure he\u2019d done something. He said\u2014\u201d she stopped long enough to regain her composure \u201c\u2014Anson said it was better for me not to know.\u201d</p><p>Kaci\u2019s shoulders sagged. \u201cHe did it, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know. I asked him outright and he swore he didn\u2019t. He asked me to believe in him. And I do, I do.\u201d Her throat started to close up again. \u201cHe said I\u2019m the only person in his life who\u2019s ever had faith in him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he asked you to help him now, would you?\u201d Kaci asked.</p> <p>Allison hung her head, unable to answer. What she had with Anson was more precious than any other relationship in her life, outside of her family. She loved him, but she had to stop deceiving herself. She couldn\u2019t continue to believe in him just because she wanted to. It was time to accept the fact that Anson might be guilty.</p><p>Twenty</p><p>\u201cCome here, Grammy\u2019s girl,\u201d Ellen Bowman called, chasing Katie around the kitchen. Over the weeks, the formalities had been dispensed with. Joseph had become Grampa Joe and Ellen was Grammy.</p><p>Letting out a squeal of glee, Katie made her grandmother run after her in a mock game of tag. Jon\u2019s stepmother was endlessly patient with the little girl. Maryellen felt grateful\u2014and deeply moved\u2014to see how much Jon\u2019s family loved her daughter.</p><p>Nevertheless, Jon still kept his distance. Nothing Maryellen said or did seemed to help, so the situation continued unchanged.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time for your nap, young lady,\u201d Maryellen reminded Katie. The child had no interest in sleeping if Grammy and Grampa Joe were available\u2014as they always were, at least on weekdays. Katie had grown so close to her grandparents. Joe was just as enthralled with his granddaughter as his wife, and they spent countless hours entertaining the child; it was as if she\u2019d become the focus of their existence.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll take her up,\u201d Joe offered.</p><p>\u201cNo, I will,\u201d Ellen said.</p><p>Maryellen\u2019s father-in-law laughed. \u201cHow about if we both go upstairs with her.\u201d</p><p>The three of them disappeared up the flight of stairs and Maryellen figured it would be at least an hour before Katie fell asleep. Katie would insist that her grandparents read to her first and then sing to her and heaven knew what else. Only after that would Katie consent to have her nap.</p><p>Maryellen treasured the peace and quiet. Since Joe and Ellen had arrived, the pregnancy had been almost free of problems. Her stress had all but disappeared, thanks to her in-laws. She missed Jon, who still held his job photographing students in Tacoma schools. Never once had he complained, but Maryellen knew he hated it. She hated it for him.</p><p>But there was good news from the research she\u2019d done online. One of the largest licensing agents in the business had agreed to review Jon\u2019s work. This was no small success; if Jon was accepted as a client, it would change everything. His work would be licensed for use on book covers, calendars, ads, all sorts of places. Jon might never know where or when his photographs would appear, which was a bit disappointing; however, the up-front money and the royalties would more than compensate for that. Maryellen was thrilled to know that someday they could be on the road and look up at a billboard and see Jon\u2019s work.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t told him yet because she didn\u2019t want to get his hopes up. For now, this was her secret and she held it close to her heart. One thing was sure: if he was accepted and his work became popular, their current money problems would be over.</p><p>Maryellen\u2019s general health had improved, and the doctor was pleased with how well the pregnancy was progressing. Judging by all the fetal activity she experienced, the baby was feeling just as good.</p> <p>Caressing her abdomen, Maryellen felt fortunate to have carried this child as long as she had. In three weeks\u2014but more likely two, according to Dr. DeGroot at her last appointment\u2014she\u2019d finally meet this baby of hers. As with Katie, she and Jon had decided they didn\u2019t want to know the sex of their child before the birth.</p><p>The phone rang and Maryellen answered as quickly as she could. Since he\u2019d been hired by the portrait studio, Jon occasionally phoned to check on her. He didn\u2019t often, and she knew that was because he didn\u2019t want to risk talking to his parents.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHi, Maryellen, it\u2019s Rachel. I was just calling to see how you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Rachel.\u201d Maryellen responded, delighted to hear from her friend. \u201cI\u2019m feeling...pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Rachel laughed. \u201cCliff came in to ask me if you\u2019re ready for another beauty treatment.\u201d</p><p>Her stepfather was both kind and generous and he, like her mother, had been more than accommodating. Grace had joked that they\u2019d hold the wedding reception, two baptisms and baby showers all at one time, during the summer. Her sister, Kelly, was due to deliver her second child a few weeks after Maryellen. The family had a lot to celebrate.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, actually,\u201d Maryellen said. \u201cMy hair\u2019s still looking okay.\u201d In fact, she planned to let it grow again. \u201cI\u2019ll call Cliff and thank him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your nails?\u201d</p><p>Maryellen examined her hands and sighed expressively. \u201cThat, my friend, is a different story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought so. Let me book you an appointment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so far for you to come all this way,\u201d she protested, although Maryellen would love to see her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you worry about it. I\u2019ll be there at one o\u2019clock on Wednesday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks\u2014and when you get here be prepared to fill me in on all the gossip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Rachel promised. Lowering her voice, she added, \u201cYou heard about Teri and that chess player, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean about her going over to Seattle and cutting Bobby Polgar\u2019s hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, there\u2019s more. Much more.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen sat up straighter. \u201cTell me now. I don\u2019t want to wait until Wednesday.\u201d</p><p>Rachel gave a small giggle. \u201cHe came to Cedar Cove a little while after the chess match, which he won, in case you didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen did. \u201cTo Cedar Cove? Bobby Polgar was in Cedar Cove?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot once, but twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwice.\u201d This was even better than she\u2019d imagined. \u201cTell me more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBobby\u2019s from somewhere back east. I can\u2019t remember where Teri said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew York,\u201d Maryellen supplied. Not that she was a keen follower of chess players\u2014or chess, for that matter. But she\u2019d read a lengthy article in the Smithsonian magazine about Bobby a few years ago, and for some reason remembered a lot of it. He\u2019d been playing chess from the time he could walk. By the age of three, he was beating grown men in local chess clubs. It didn\u2019t take him long to gain recognition. She recalled one picture in which this child, this little boy, sat with his small hand extended across the chessboard for a sportsmanlike victory shake.</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d Rachel continued, \u201che came to Cedar Cove the first time to pay Teri, something he failed to do when she went to Seattle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope she took the money.\u201d In Maryellen\u2019s view, Teri had earned it.</p><p>\u201cShe did, and they had a beer together, too.\u201d</p><p>A beer? Somehow she couldn\u2019t picture the great Bobby Polgar drinking beer with Teri Miller. \u201cWhat about the second time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe came back a week later. They must\u2019ve gone out to dinner but I can\u2019t say for sure because Teri\u2019s been very quiet ever since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeri? Quiet?\u201d</p><p>Rachel lowered her voice even more until Maryellen had to strain to hear. \u201cThe truth is, I think she\u2019s falling for him.\u201d</p><p>That was bad news. Bobby Polgar was the last man in the world Maryellen could see with a woman like Teri\u2014irreverent and funny. She had a wicked sense of humor and a heart of gold. But Teri and Bobby Polgar, one of the world\u2019s intellectual geniuses? It\u2019d never work.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of romance, how\u2019s it going with you and Nate?\u201d Maryellen asked.</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019ll tell you all about it on Wednesday,\u201d Rachel said.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait.\u201d For years Maryellen had watched the girls at Get Nailed bemoan the lack of romance in their lives. Then within a year or so, they all seemed to be finding love, and in the most unlikely places, too.</p><p>Rachel had been attracted to Nate Olsen after the first date. But then Nate had informed her he was seeing a girl back home; disappointed, Rachel had tried to forget him and gone about her life. All of a sudden Nate was back and she\u2019d fallen head over heels in love.</p><p>After her conversation with Rachel, the afternoon sped by. When Ellen brought Katie down, following her nap, she baked brownies, letting her granddaughter \u201chelp,\u201d while Joe did some work in the garden.</p><p>\u201cThese are Jon\u2019s favorite,\u201d Ellen said, cutting the brownies and setting them on a plate on the kitchen counter.</p><p>Conscious of the time, the older couple packed up their things and left by five. A half hour after they\u2019d returned to their hotel, Jon came home.</p><p>Because the sun was still shining brightly and the garden smelled of lilacs, Maryellen had moved awkwardly outside to sit on the deck. She wanted to be in the fresh, clean air, enjoying the scents of spring. The deck afforded Katie a small play area, too, and Maryellen could keep an eye on her.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Jon said happily when he found the two of them outdoors. \u201cHow are my girls?\u201d he asked, sweeping Katie into his arms.</p><p>Maryellen smiled as Katie wrapped her own arms around his neck and offered him a sloppy kiss. She chattered away, and Jon pretended to understand every word.</p><p>\u201cShe has a surprise for you in the kitchen,\u201d Maryellen told him.</p><p>After hugging Maryellen and gently rubbing her belly, Jon went inside with Katie. \u201cIt\u2019s brownies,\u201d he called out. \u201cMy favorite.\u201d</p><p>Soon he was back, holding the plate aloft. \u201cYou mean to tell me my girls baked me brownies?\u201d</p><p>Katie was so proud to see her father enjoying what she\u2019d made\u2014with her grandmother\u2019s notable assistance\u2014that Maryellen let him assume she\u2019d been in the kitchen herself. Jon broke off a corner and shared it with her. Katie poked it into her mouth and instantly wanted more.</p><p>\u201cGreedy little girl, aren\u2019t you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Maryellen laughed. \u201cAnd who\u2019s got that whole plate?\u201d</p><p>Jon chuckled. \u201cPoint well-taken.\u201d He sat down, relaxing in the wooden deck chair, and looked out over the view. Vashon Island was visible in the distance and so was the distinctive shape of Mount Rainier.</p><p>Legs stretched out before him, Jon slipped his arm around her shoulders. Maryellen savored the warmth and comfort of his embrace.</p><p>\u201cI know this has been a difficult pregnancy for you,\u201d he began. \u201cI\u2019m glad it\u2019s almost over.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt has been hard in some ways, and in others it\u2019s been...wonderful.\u201d</p><p>Jon seemed taken aback by her comment. \u201cWonderful? How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s brought us together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I ever would\u2019ve had the courage to leave the gallery. Everyone relied on me, and it was so easy to put off giving my notice. Then all of a sudden I didn\u2019t have any choice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like you to be home with our babies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s where I want to be\u2014and with you, too.\u201d Her love for Jon seemed tangible and strong.</p><p>Jon reached for a second brownie as Katie sat contentedly at his feet. \u201cOnce when I was in junior high, I ate a plate of these on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Ellen told me about it.\u201d She\u2019d mentioned his stepmother without thinking and felt him stiffen.</p><p>Jon stared suspiciously at the one in his hand. \u201cShe didn\u2019t bake these, did she?\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly Maryellen nodded.</p> <p>Jon threw the brownie back on the plate as if it had lost its taste. \u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSet me up like that. What did you and Ellen do, sit around all afternoon making plans to break down my defenses? The way to a man\u2019s heart is through his stomach, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJon, stop it,\u201d she snapped. He\u2019d ruined a very pleasant interlude. \u201cWe did nothing of the sort.\u201d</p><p>She could tell by his lack of response that he didn\u2019t believe her. \u201cI\u2019m going upstairs to change,\u201d he muttered, taking the brownies and walking into the kitchen through the open French doors.</p><p>It seemed so hopeless, Maryellen thought sadly. He refused to bend on this matter, refused to forgive his parents or accept their remorse.</p><p>A few minutes later, Jon was back, wearing jeans and a T-shirt. \u201cI think I\u2019ll mow the lawn,\u201d he said as though nothing had happened.</p><p>Maryellen hoped physical labor would improve his mood. \u201cGood idea,\u201d she said curtly.</p> <p>All at once Katie let out a cry and Jon rushed into the kitchen, Maryellen following at a slower pace. She discovered her daughter pulling the brownies out of the garbage can where Jon had tossed them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, sweetheart,\u201d Jon tried to tell her.</p><p>\u201cGrammy,\u201d Katie cried, kicking and screaming on the floor. \u201cI hate you. I want my Grammy.\u201d</p><p>Jon looked at Maryellen for help, but she didn\u2019t know what to tell him. His thoughtless act had broken their daughter\u2019s heart.</p><p>Twenty-One</p><p>Since she\u2019d been on her feet all morning, Teri welcomed a break before her next client showed up. Sitting in her own cubicle chair, with her back to the mirror, she ate hot, salty French fries and sipped a diet soda. One of the other girls had picked up some takeout for lunch, and Teri had ordered her ultimate comfort food. The drink was a concession to calorie cutting.</p><p>Rachel finished with her nail client, then joined Teri in the adjacent cubicle. \u201cYou\u2019ve been quiet all morning,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not like you.\u201d</p><p>Teri shrugged. She\u2019d been feeling depressed for the last few days and didn\u2019t want to talk about it. She hadn\u2019t been able to stop thinking about Bobby Polgar since he\u2019d rolled into Cedar Cove in that stretch limo with his driver, James. Apparently Bobby had never learned to drive. He\u2019d come to see her again, and after that, he\u2019d been calling her every day.</p><p>\u201cIs it Bobby Polgar?\u201d Rachel asked, keeping her voice low so as not to attract attention from the other girls or their clients.</p><p>Teri nearly dropped her Diet Coke. \u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d</p><p>Rachel\u2019s smile was shrewd. \u201cHow many years have we worked together?\u201d She didn\u2019t wait for a response. \u201cIn all that time, I\u2019ve never seen you this...subdued.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe calls me every night.\u201d The crazy part was that Bobby phoned at exactly seven, Pacific Daylight Time, regardless of where he was. Not one minute before or one minute after, always precisely at seven. The man got around, too. Just last week he\u2019d been in China and the week before that he\u2019d been somewhere in Europe. Prague, if she recalled correctly. His home was in New York City, although she doubted he was there even twenty percent of the time. He always seemed to be on the road. She hadn\u2019t figured out what he did in all those exotic locations once the chess match was over. When he called, he asked her ordinary questions about her day. To be fair, she asked him pretty much the same kind of thing. Mostly she wanted to know where he was calling from. If he was in his hotel at the time, he\u2019d describe whatever he could see from his window. He told her about his chess matches in terms that were light years beyond her understanding. She told him about her customers and how many color jobs, perms or haircuts she\u2019d worked on, the conversations she\u2019d had and what she was reading.</p><p>\u201cYou like him, don\u2019t you?\u201d Rachel asked, peeling a banana and taking a bite.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Teri declared.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting all my life to fall in love,\u201d Teri muttered, and it was true. Rachel knew about all the losers Teri had been involved with through the years. After she\u2019d graduated from beauty school, she\u2019d been too stupid to know any better. She seemed to learn life\u2019s lessons the hard way. Once a guy had emptied her entire bank account, and she\u2019d had no one to blame but herself. She\u2019d actually given him her ATM card and her PIN number! Given it to him because he needed twenty bucks and she had a perm going and couldn\u2019t leave. Talk about stupid. Only it wasn\u2019t twenty bucks he\u2019d walked away with. Instead he\u2019d taken the maximum amount, which happened to be exactly what she\u2019d had in her savings.</p><p>Then there was Ray. She\u2019d made the mistake of letting him move in with her. It was only until he got a few things straightened out financially, he\u2019d claimed, and then they\u2019d be married. What a joke. Within a week he\u2019d \u201clost\u201d his job, and she found herself supporting him. It took six months and a sheriff\u2019s deputy to get him out of her apartment.</p><p>Her history with men was abysmal. Her judgment was bad, just like her mother\u2019s. Teri no longer trusted herself when it came to men, and she didn\u2019t understand why Bobby Polgar seemed to be so fascinated with her.</p><p>\u201cI told him not to phone me again,\u201d she said. She\u2019d come to look forward to those ridiculous phone calls from Bobby, but she had absolutely nothing in common with him.</p><p>\u201cHas he called since?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d For two nights Teri had sat by the phone, waiting. Hoping he\u2019d call despite her demand. Wishing he would.</p><p>\u201cOh, Teri,\u201d Rachel said, with a resigned sigh. \u201cYou\u2019re afraid, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight I am!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet you were the first person who told me I shouldn\u2019t let the fact that Nate\u2019s father is a congressman keep me from loving Nate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s different with you,\u201d Teri argued. \u201cYou\u2019re much smarter than me. You never let a loser move in with you and suck you dry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make me smart.\u201d</p><p>Teri snorted softly. \u201cIt does in my book.\u201d She didn\u2019t mention her mother. Rachel\u2019s mother had died when she was young and she\u2019d been raised by an aunt. Teri\u2019s mother had married four or five times. Maybe it was six; Teri had lost count. She had a couple of siblings she\u2019d practically raised herself. Her half sister, Christie, was married to a drunk and going through a divorce.</p><p>Her half brother, Johnny, was seven years younger and in college, and he was staying there if she had anything to say about it. She helped him with tuition and routinely checked on him to be sure he was studying and his marks were good. That kid was graduating and doing something decent with his life if she had to kill him to make it happen.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what Bobby sees in me anyway,\u201d she said, and popped another French fry in her mouth. She barely had a high-school education. Okay, a GED, but she was top of her class in beauty school. In the looks department, she was all right, she supposed. Average attractive. Her hair color changed depending on her mood. Currently it was black and short, but she was thinking about bleaching it.</p><p>\u201cI know why Bobby likes you,\u201d Rachel said. \u201cYou\u2019re a breath of fresh air to him, and you\u2019re different from everyone else he knows.\u201d She grinned. \u201cHe\u2019s probably never met anyone like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even play chess,\u201d Teri muttered.</p><p>\u201cThat makes you all the more attractive to him. Chess is his entire life. It\u2019s all he knows. You\u2019ve opened up a whole new world to him. Plus, you\u2019re fun and sassy, and he doesn\u2019t intimidate you like he does everyone else.\u201d</p><p>Again and again Teri had examined her memories of that Saturday in Seattle, when she\u2019d bullied her way in to see Bobby and cut his hair. She\u2019d done crazy stuff before, but this was a new high\u2014or maybe a new low. Even after analyzing the incident to death, Teri still couldn\u2019t explain what had driven her to do it. Now she was paying the price and as with every other relationship in her life, the price was too high. She was falling in love with this geek and it wouldn\u2019t work. Not in a million years.</p><p>\u201cAnytime you want to talk,\u201d Rachel said, standing up, \u201cI\u2019m available. Just remember the advice you gave me about Nate.\u201d</p><p>Sharing her problems wasn\u2019t something Teri did often. She was closer to Rachel than practically anyone, but talking about Bobby, even with the person she considered her best friend, was difficult.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said, dumping the rest of her fries in the garbage. Anyway, there was nothing more to say about Bobby, since she hadn\u2019t heard from him in two days. Painful as it was, she\u2019d made her point; he wouldn\u2019t call her again.</p><p>Nevertheless, Teri was sitting by the phone that evening, just in case Bobby had a change of heart. At exactly seven, her doorbell rang. Irritated, she grabbed her portable phone and carried it to the door.</p><p>There, standing directly in front of her, holding a huge arrangement of bright red roses, was the ever-courteous James. The vase probably weighed more than he did. \u201cGood evening, Miss Teri,\u201d he intoned.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWould you mind opening the door a little wider so I can bring these in?\u201d James asked breathlessly.</p><p>Teri unlatched the screen door but she wasn\u2019t letting him inside her home. No way. \u201cI\u2019ll take them,\u201d she insisted, placing the phone on her small hallway table. She accepted the display from him and instantly regretted it. The vase had to weigh a good fifty pounds. She lugged it over to the coffee table and set it down, sloshing water as she did. \u201cHow many roses are there?\u201d she asked, utterly astonished. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSix dozen.\u201d</p><p>Teri groaned. They must\u2019ve cost a fortune. Six dozen roses? No man had ever given her more than a single rose.</p><p>\u201cI hope you like chocolates,\u201d he said next. \u201cI have ten pounds from the top six candy companies around the world. Bobby didn\u2019t know if you had a preference, so he wanted all the bases covered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen pounds of chocolate?\u201d No man had ever bought her chocolate. Men generally knew not to give an overweight girlfriend candy.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re in the car, along with the perfume.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfume?\u201d Hands on her hips, Teri studied Bobby\u2019s driver. \u201cWhat\u2019s this about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Miss Teri...\u201d James removed his driver\u2019s hat and exhaled. \u201cBobby asked a colleague what women like, and his friend said flowers, candy, perfume and sentimental cards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Bobby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the car,\u201d James told her. \u201cI\u2019m double-parked outside. Bobby\u2019s in there signing the cards.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCards?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sentimental ones. He bought a dozen.\u201d</p><p>Sure enough, the stretch limo was parked in a lot reserved for the occupants of the apartment complex. Several of her neighbors had stepped outside to gawk at it. Her neighborhood wasn\u2019t accustomed to seeing cars that required uniformed drivers.</p><p>Teri marched past her neighbors and opened the passenger door. Without waiting for an invitation, she climbed inside. Yup, there was Bobby Polgar, pen in hand. Boxes of chocolates were stacked beside him, as well as a pile of sealed envelopes and a stack of expensive perfume boxes.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d she asked, sitting across from him. She tried to sound stern, and yet she couldn\u2019t deny her thrill of happiness.</p><p>\u201cYou asked me not to phone you again,\u201d he answered, eyes widening behind the dark-rimmed glasses. \u201cI didn\u2019t call.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would\u2019ve arrived two days ago but I was in the middle of a match.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBobby.\u201d He made it so difficult to be angry. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d she repeated, at a loss to understand this man.</p><p>He didn\u2019t speak for a long time, and then he blurted out, \u201cI need a haircut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone qualified to cut hair can do that. You didn\u2019t have to fly halfway around the world for me to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the roses and the chocolates\u2014and everything else?\u201d She gestured toward the perfume. According to James, Bobby had solicited advice on the gifts women preferred, and been given these generic suggestions. The real question was why he felt he needed to present her with gifts at all.</p><p>He shifted uncomfortably as he glanced around the vehicle. He seemed to look everywhere but at her. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what I\u2019d done that you\u2019d ask me not to phone. I liked talking to you. I looked forward to it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did, too,\u201d she reluctantly confessed.</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d He wrinkled his brow. \u201cThen why did you make me stop?\u201d</p><p>If he hadn\u2019t figured it out, she couldn\u2019t explain it.</p><p>\u201cExperts have calculated that I\u2019ve committed to memory over a hundred thousand possible chess configurations,\u201d he said. \u201cI look at a chessboard and within seconds I can figure out how any move my opponent makes is going to play out. I know chess, but I don\u2019t know women. I want to know you. I like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like you, too. In fact, I like you a lot and that frightens me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She might as well tell him the truth. \u201cI\u2019m not all that intelligent.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, apparently unconcerned. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. But even if it is, I\u2019m smart enough for both of us. Did you like the roses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I kiss you now?\u201d</p><p>She laughed and then realized he was serious. He watched her, anticipating her kiss. He met her eyes and extended his hand to her.</p><p>Crouching, she made her way toward him. Because of all the candy and perfume stacked next to him, she had to sit on his lap. She slid her arms around his neck, then removed his glasses, folded them and slipped them into his pocket. When she\u2019d finished, she gave him an encouraging smile and leaned forward so their lips could meet.</p><p>As kisses went, this one was pretty tame. Bobby might know plenty of chess moves, but that was the only kind of move he knew. He sure didn\u2019t have a lot of sexual finesse. Well...he might possess enough brains for both of them, but she had enough experience.</p><p>Bobby cleared his throat after two follow-up kisses, each lengthier and more intense than the one before.</p><p>\u201cThat was very nice,\u201d Bobby whispered. He seemed to have difficulty speaking.</p><p>\u201cYes, it was. Are you ready for your haircut?\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat a second time and nodded.</p><p>Most of her neighbors had gone back inside when Teri emerged from the limousine. Thank goodness for tinted windows! If any of the stragglers recognized Bobby, they didn\u2019t say anything. Bobby gave his driver instructions to return in a couple of hours and accompanied Teri into her small apartment.</p><p>Had she known she was going to have company, she would\u2019ve cleaned the place up a bit. Bobby didn\u2019t seem to notice that she wasn\u2019t giving Martha Stewart any competition. In fact, he didn\u2019t seem to notice anything but her.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she muttered, uncomfortable with the way his eyes followed her every move.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something different about you,\u201d he commented.</p><p>\u201cI dyed my hair black.\u201d She pulled out a kitchen chair and gestured for him to sit. She kept a spare cape in a bottom drawer; she took it out and wrapped it around him, fastening it at the neck.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you change your hair color?\u201d he asked. \u201cI liked it the way you had it the last time I saw you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was in a black mood,\u201d she said and went briefly to her bedroom to retrieve scissors and a comb.</p><p>She\u2019d just started trimming his hair when he announced, \u201cI want to marry you.\u201d</p><p>Teri lowered her arms and exhaled harshly. \u201cStop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll cut your hair, but I am not marrying you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even know me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that important?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, shocked he\u2019d ask such a fundamental question. \u201cLove helps, too.\u201d</p><p>Bobby frowned. \u201cI\u2019m not good with emotions.\u201d</p><p>No surprise there. \u201cGo figure,\u201d she teased.</p><p>Bobby smiled slightly. \u201cWill you let me kiss you again?\u201d</p><p>She continued to clip the sides of his hair. \u201cProbably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much chocolate did you bring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen pounds. Is it enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlenty,\u201d she assured him. Just to show him how much she appreciated good chocolate, she straddled his lap. Scissors still in her hand, she hooked her arms around his neck. With a surge of joy she didn\u2019t bother to examine or to question, she gave Bobby Polgar, world chess champion, a kiss that could\u2019ve won a competition of its own.</p><p>Twenty-Two</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s someone here to see you,\u201d Frank Chesterfield, the bank president, told Justine late Friday afternoon. She normally worked mornings, but Frank had asked her to take care of some pending loan applications so she\u2019d agreed to stay. She\u2019d gone into the vault and before she could ask who it was, Frank was gone.</p><p>Most likely Warren Saget had stopped by for another chat. He was still doing that despite her lack of encouragement or welcome. He chose to ignore her wishes and persisted in visiting her far too often. It wasn\u2019t that Justine disliked Warren. He was her friend and had proved it the day of her panic attack.</p><p>She could do without seeing him right now, though. Seth had been depressed for several days, since the official end of the arson investigation. The building, or what was left of it, had been released to them and quickly demolished. Seth had watched it all, watched the trucks hauling away the charred remains of their dream. Justine was concerned about him and resented Warren\u2019s frequent appearances, despite his kindness to her.</p><p>She was married and she loved her husband and no friendship was worth risking her marriage over. Seth had made his feelings toward the other man plain. He didn\u2019t want her seeing Warren, no matter how platonic the relationship. Justine had every intention of abiding by his wishes. She wouldn\u2019t want him lunching with an old girlfriend, either.</p><p>However, it wasn\u2019t Warren waiting at her desk, it was her husband. She felt a stirring of excitement, of delight untainted by anger or sadness. \u201cSeth!\u201d</p><p>He stood as she approached. \u201cHi.\u201d His smile told her all was well. \u201cI\u2019ve come to make a deposit.\u201d</p><p>Justine blinked. \u201cOkay,\u201d she murmured, \u201cI\u2019ll take it to the teller\u2019s cage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you interested in what I\u2019m about to put in our bank account?\u201d he asked, the gleam in his eyes signalling his pleasure.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my first commission check.\u201d Two weeks earlier, Seth had made his first sale; he\u2019d downplayed the event but Justine had been very proud of him. Taking her lead from Seth, she\u2019d acted equally casual.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations, Seth,\u201d she said now.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He did seem pleased with himself. Standing, he withdrew his wallet from his hip pocket, ceremoniously removed the check and handed it to her.</p><p>Justine took one look at the amount and had to sit down. \u201cThis is your commission check?\u201d she asked, hardly able to form the words.</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor one boat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p><p>She looked again. \u201cWhat did you sell, the Queen Mary?\u201d</p><p>Seth\u2019s laughter echoed against the bank walls. \u201cNo, my darling wife, it was a fishing vessel, not unlike the one Dad and I used in Alaska.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a lot of money.\u201d Although the restaurant had done well, this amount was more profit than they\u2019d made in three months at The Lighthouse.</p><p>He smiled in acknowledgement. \u201cLarry says I\u2019m a natural and if so, it\u2019s because I know the business. I lived it, worked it and, well, I\u2019ve made two more sales from referrals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Seth!\u201d she gasped. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be happier for you.\u201d As far as Justine was concerned, the money was secondary. They could certainly use it, but what really mattered was the contentment she saw in her husband\u2019s eyes. She felt a renewed hope that the arsonist hadn\u2019t devastated their marriage along with the restaurant.</p><p>\u201cI already picked up Leif and he\u2019s spending the night with my parents,\u201d Seth told her. Their son had been at a birthday party for the afternoon.</p><p>Justine gave her husband a slow smile. \u201cHe is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where will we be?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going out to celebrate.\u201d</p><p>That happy smile was back on Seth\u2019s face. \u201cSounds wonderful to me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cJay and Lana are joining us in Silverdale.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jay and Lana were former classmates and good friends. With the restaurant demanding so much of their time, Seth and Justine had rarely seen any of their friends in the last few years.</p><p>\u201cAfter dinner,\u201d Seth went on, interrupting her thoughts, \u201cI have another small surprise for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than stealing me away for a celebration dinner with friends?\u201d This was more than they\u2019d done in months and months; when they were operating The Lighthouse, they\u2019d simply never had the time.</p><p>\u201cMuch better,\u201d Seth promised in a low voice.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll finish up here,\u201d she said, glancing at the clock. The bank closed later on Fridays; however, she planned to leave at six. \u201cThen I\u2019ll go home and change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot necessary,\u201d Seth told her.</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, why don\u2019t you leave now?\u201d Her boss stepped up to her desk. He winked at Seth, and Justine wondered how much Frank knew about this surprise of her husband\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cShould I drive out and meet you in Silverdale?\u201d she asked, reaching into the bottom drawer for her purse.</p> <p>\u201cNo need to do that, either,\u201d Seth said, taking her arm in his.</p><p>\u201cBut my car...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs at home.\u201d</p><p>Justine\u2019s jaw sagged. \u201cWhen did that happen?\u201d She\u2019d driven to work that morning and parked it at the far end of the lot, where employees left their vehicles.</p><p>\u201cJay and I came by earlier,\u201d Seth explained. \u201cI picked up your car and then drove back here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would like to change clothes.\u201d If they were going out for the evening, she\u2019d prefer to wear something fancier than business attire.</p> <p>\u201cI figured as much, so I brought another outfit with me.\u201d He opened the bank door as he spoke and they walked toward his car, parked near the entrance.</p><p>\u201cVery cute, Seth, and where am I supposed to change? A gas station restroom? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d She leaned against his car. \u201cI suppose I could use the employee bathroom, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, that\u2019s a good point,\u201d he muttered, his eyes bright with love and anticipation. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll just have to take you to the hotel earlier than I\u2019d planned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a hotel room for the night, complete with champagne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my goodness.\u201d Justine covered her mouth. \u201cPinch me, because I must be dreaming.\u201d</p><p>Seth brought his arms around her waist and laughed. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I kiss you, instead?\u201d</p><p>This was an offer she couldn\u2019t refuse. \u201cIt\u2019s a deal.\u201d</p> <p>The evening was everything Justine could have imagined, and more. After a lengthy dinner with excellent wine, the four of them drove to the hotel and had drinks in the elegant lounge while a three-piece ensemble played. Justine needed a couple of mixed drinks to fuel her courage before she agreed to step onto the dance floor. She was glad she did. Any excuse to have Seth\u2019s arms around her was worth potential embarrassment.</p><p>Jay and Lana had to get home to relieve their babysitter and left at midnight. Shortly after that, Seth was feigning a yawn.</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right,\u201d Justine teased. \u201cI\u2019ve got the message.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, Seth reached for her hand. In the elevator, he stood behind her, arms around her waist as he kissed the side of her neck. \u201cI\u2019m ready to collect on all those promises you\u2019ve been sending my way all evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about that surprise you promised me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see when we get to the room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Seth, I love you so much.\u201d She turned in his arms and held him close. It felt as if she had her husband back at last\u2014as if the burdens of the months since the fire had fallen away.</p><p>\u201cJust wait until you see what I bought you to wear to bed,\u201d he whispered with a low groan\u2014obviously picturing her in it.</p><p>\u201cDo you really want me to take the time to change?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Seth murmured. \u201cNo, don\u2019t bother. The minute you put it on, I\u2019ll be taking it off.\u201d</p><p>Justine closed her eyes and smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d</p><p>The elevator doors glided open, and Seth swung her into his powerful arms as though she weighed next to nothing. He headed down the long hallway toward their room. It was a small comedy of errors as he tried to hold her while attempting to open the door with the room card. Justine dissolved into giggles and then they were both laughing. He had to put her down before he managed to get the door unlocked.</p><p>Seth didn\u2019t bother to turn on the lights. He shut the door and pressed her against it, kissing her with hot, urgent hunger.</p><p>\u201cOh, Seth,\u201d she breathed, her head spinning. \u201cI was so afraid I\u2019d lost you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d His hands worked at the tiny buttons on her silk blouse. \u201cI think you\u2019d better get out of this before I accidentally rip something.\u201d</p><p>She giggled again and took over the task of unbuttoning the blouse.</p><p>They made love that night and again in the morning. Lying there, spent, Justine felt utterly relaxed in her husband\u2019s arms, utterly tranquil and at peace.</p><p>\u201cSeth,\u201d she whispered, thinking aloud. \u201cI need to ask you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything.\u201d He stroked her bare back, letting his hand roam from her shoulder blades to the curve of her waist.</p><p>\u201cAfter a night out\u2014the first one in over a year\u2014are you sure you want to rebuild the restaurant?\u201d</p><p>His hand stilled, and she feared she\u2019d destroyed the moment.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know anymore, Justine. I just don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-Three</p><p>On Sunday at noon, Nate drove to Rachel\u2019s with a picnic lunch. She met him on the sidewalk outside her front door, too eager to wait. Throwing herself into his arms, she sighed as he hugged and kissed her. It was weeks since they\u2019d spent more than a couple of hours together.</p><p>His work schedule was hectic, but so was hers. Her days off were Sunday and Monday, although lately she\u2019d been working Mondays, too. As soon as the navy wives had gotten word that she did both hair and nails, her schedule had started filling up. Her bookings were practically overlapping. The money was great, but she needed a break.</p><p>\u201cWhere would you like to go?\u201d Nate asked, smiling down at her.</p><p>\u201cHow about Point Defiance Park?\u201d she suggested. The Tacoma park was always lovely, but especially at this time of year with the rhododendrons and azaleas in bloom.</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d Nate kissed the top of her head. \u201cI can have you all to myself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Rachel knew the question referred to the time she spent with Jolene. Nate didn\u2019t complain much, but he wasn\u2019t pleased\u2014and she realized it was her relationship with Bruce that troubled him, not her friendship with the little girl.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>The day could not have been more ideal for their outing. The sun shone brightly in a clear blue sky, and a light breeze blew off the cove. Rachel grabbed her sweater, then slipped into the front seat of Nate\u2019s convertible, a relatively new acquisition. He\u2019d chosen a candy-apple red and she\u2019d fallen in love with it the minute he\u2019d brought it over the first time.</p><p>The wind blew her hair into total chaos, not that Rachel cared. She was with Nate, and they had the whole day together. The weather was a bonus, but it wouldn\u2019t have mattered if the skies had opened and drenched them with rain. In that case, they would\u2019ve had their picnic on her living room floor.</p><p>They wandered through the park, finally choosing a secluded spot where Nate spread out a blanket. The picnic basket boasted fried chicken, potato salad, rolls and coleslaw, which Nate had picked up at a chicken franchise before coming to collect her. He\u2019d also brought some white wine that was way more expensive than anything she ever chose.</p><p>When they\u2019d eaten, Nate sprawled out with his head nestled in her lap. Rachel lazily stroked his hair and savored this peaceful afternoon together. Nate\u2019s eyes drifted shut and Rachel discovered that she felt sleepy, too. The sun\u2019s warmth, the wine and the food and, most of all, being with Nate produced a sense of well-being and uncomplicated joy.</p><p>The tranquility of the moment was shattered by the shrill ring of Nate\u2019s cell phone.</p><p>Jerking upright, Nate frowned and reached for the phone, clipped to his waist. \u201cHello,\u201d he answered tersely. But then his demeanor changed and he relaxed.</p><p>After a minute or two of conversation, Rachel realized it was Nate\u2019s mother on the phone.</p><p>\u201cA political rally for Dad,\u201d he repeated. He looked at Rachel and smiled reassuringly. \u201cIn October. I can request leave, but Mom, there\u2019s no guarantee. Yes, yes, of course, I understand this is important. I\u2019ll do what I can.\u201d He touched his index finger to his mouth and kissed it, then pressed it against Rachel\u2019s lips.</p><p>She smiled and brought his finger into her mouth and gently sucked on it.</p><p>Nate darted her a warning glance before he withdrew his finger.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m with Rachel,\u201d he said unexpectedly. \u201cThis would be a good time to introduce yourself.\u201d</p><p>A feeling of dread washed over her. Nate\u2019s powerful, wealthy family made her feel insecure. Her sole disagreement with him while he was away at sea for six months had been about the difference between their stations in life. In defiance of his father, Nate had enlisted in the navy and, through his own skills, had risen to the grade of warrant officer, the highest of any noncommissioned rank.</p><p>Apparently Nate had something else to prove to his father, and she was afraid that something was his relationship with her. Rachel\u2019s biggest fear was that dating her was another act of defiance on his part, although Nate fervently assured her otherwise.</p><p>Nevertheless, Rachel kept a close guard on her heart. She was apprehensive, justifiably so, in her opinion. Still she found herself drawn to him despite everything. She treasured the hours they could spend together and looked forward to their conversations. Even when he wasn\u2019t at sea, they e-mailed each other often. Rachel sometimes used the computer at the salon during her breaks, although privacy wasn\u2019t exactly in great supply.</p><p>\u201cHere, why don\u2019t you talk to Rachel,\u201d Nate said next and without warning handed her the cell phone.</p><p>She glared at him and shook her head, refusing to accept it. Nate insisted, however, and given no choice, she took the cell.</p><p>\u201cHello, Mrs. Olsen, this is Rachel Pendergast,\u201d she said, making a face at him.</p><p>Nate smiled and brought her right hand to his mouth, sucking on her finger. She yanked it away and turned around so she could concentrate on his mother.</p><p>\u201cHello, Rachel,\u201d his mother greeted her warmly. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to finally get a chance to meet you, even if it is over my son\u2019s cell. And please, call me Patrice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, Patrice,\u201d she said, nearly stumbling over the name. \u201cIt\u2019s lovely to meet you, too.\u201d Rachel\u2019s heart felt lodged in her throat as she struggled to think of some appropriate comment.</p><p>\u201cYou certainly seem to have captured our son\u2019s interest.\u201d</p><p>Rachel glanced over her shoulder and exchanged a smile with Nate. \u201cHe\u2019s wonderful.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you know he broke off a long-standing relationship with the daughter of one of our dearest friends because of you.\u201d</p><p>Nate had made it clear on their first date that he had a girlfriend back home.</p><p>\u201cYes, he did mention that. I hope it hasn\u2019t caused any problems with your friends.\u201d Nate had also mentioned that he was glad to be out of the relationship and that the girl\u2014she didn\u2019t remember her name\u2014was already engaged to someone else.</p><p>Patrice\u2019s returning laughter sounded a bit strained. \u201cNo problem at all. Please don\u2019t concern yourself. Everything\u2019s fine. I, uh, hear you\u2019re a bit older than Nate.\u201d</p> <p>This, too, had led to arguments between Nate and Rachel. \u201cFive years,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI\u2019m five years older.\u201d On their first meeting, Nate had seemed so young, and at thirty, Rachel had felt worlds older. But Nate had eventually convinced her that those few years meant nothing. Every now and then, she reminded herself that when she\u2019d graduated from high school, Nate had been in seventh grade.</p><p>\u201cFive years isn\u2019t that much of a difference,\u201d Patrice said reassuringly. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to think when Nate said you were older. It would be just like him to arrive with a forty-year-old divorc\u00e9e on his arm. He does things like that, you know? I swear, it\u2019s just another way of defying his father and me. He did that as a youngster, too.\u201d She laughed lightly, as if a little embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cDid Nate tell you I\u2019m a nail tech?\u201d Rachel felt she needed to bring up her occupation. Might as well put it all out there.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in the navy, too?\u201d Patrice asked, sounding surprised.</p><p>\u201cNo, I work in a salon and do hair and nails. That kind of tech.\u201d</p> <p>Silence. Then, \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Her reaction told Rachel that Nate hadn\u2019t said anything about it.</p><p>Patrice recovered quickly. \u201cNo, but that\u2019s our Nate. He likes to deliver his little surprises. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re very talented with hair and, ah, fingernails.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Rachel managed. \u201cPerhaps I should pass the phone back to Nate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>Rachel gladly returned the cell phone, and while Nate ended the conversation, she started walking. She needed to think about the emotions this brief conversation with his mother had brought to the surface. She was afraid she\u2019d made a terrible impression. His mother\u2019s attitude was clear and unmistakable: Without even meeting her, Patrice Olsen had decided Rachel was an inappropriate choice for her only son.</p> <p>Nate caught up with her a few minutes later and she was grateful to see he was no longer talking on his cell.</p><p>\u201cRachel, wait,\u201d he said, grabbing her shoulders. \u201cWhat did my mother say?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNothing. She was very nice.\u201d Even as she spoke, Rachel\u2019s stomach knotted. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I let this happen,\u201d she whispered, covering her face with both hands. Despite the inner voice that had warned her about the dangers of this relationship, she\u2019d resisted. Almost from the first, she\u2019d known that dating this young officer wouldn\u2019t work for either of them. His father was a congressman, for heaven\u2019s sake!</p><p>\u201cRachel, tell me,\u201d he pleaded.</p><p>\u201cShe had no idea that I\u2019m employed as a nail tech. She thought it had something to do with the navy.\u201d She hiccupped a laugh at the absurdity of such a comment. His mother had to know about nail techs, but Rachel didn\u2019t want to assume the comment had been deliberate. Any more than she wanted to think the remarks about her age and his previous girlfriend hid some malicious intent.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m phoning Mom back and asking her to apologize,\u201d Nate said, reaching for the cell clipped to his belt.</p><p>\u201cNo, please, don\u2019t.\u201d Her hand stopped him. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you upset?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t belong in your world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong,\u201d he declared. \u201cWe belong together. I knew it from the beginning.\u201d He walked away, pacing restlessly, as though he couldn\u2019t bear to stand still. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the first time my parents have done this kind of thing. They feel this need to control my life, and I\u2019m not letting it happen. I love you, Rachel. Do you hear me?\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, afraid to believe what he was saying.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he repeated, \u201cand furthermore, I don\u2019t give a damn what my parents think about it. The minute they meet you, they\u2019ll love you, too, and if they don\u2019t, then it\u2019s their loss. I won\u2019t allow them to come between us.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to trust in the depth of their feelings, but while he might be sure of how he felt right now, at some point that could all change. \u201cNate, please don\u2019t. It\u2019d be best all the way round if we just ended this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way! You aren\u2019t doing this to me again. You\u2019ve got to believe in us, Rach.\u201d</p><p>She did, and yet she was afraid.</p><p>He drew her into his arms, and his hold on her tightened as she struggled with her resolve. \u201cYou can\u2019t let every little roadblock dissuade you,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>That was true but...</p><p>\u201cAre you so willing to give up on us? Do I mean so little to you?\u201d Already Rachel felt herself weakening. Nate was right; she needed to be determined, especially where his family was concerned. She had to accept the strength of their love. She had to believe.</p><p>Twenty-Four</p><p>On the last Saturday of May, Charlotte and Ben decided to visit the Farmers\u2019 Market at the Cedar Cove waterfront. She loved the displays of flowers and baked goods, plus the various crafts. And she always made a point of visiting the animal shelter\u2019s booth, where Grace often volunteered. It was still too early for much fresh produce but the market did a thriving business, nonetheless.</p><p>Although the day was overcast, Charlotte chose to be optimistic and suggested they walk. Being a good sport, Ben agreed.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Charlotte said as soon as they entered the market. \u201cThere\u2019s fresh rhubarb this week.\u201d Her own garden had once yielded an abundant supply. She hurried forward to buy half a dozen stalks.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose I\u2019ve mentioned that rhubarb pie\u2019s my absolute favorite,\u201d Ben said as he took the sack from the vendor.</p><p>\u201cI thought peach pie was your favorite,\u201d Charlotte teased.</p><p>Her husband recovered quickly. \u201cPeach pie is indeed my favorite\u2014in August. My favorite pie changes seasonally, sort of like those flags you hang out on the porch and have me switch around according to the months.\u201d The current flag celebrated spring.</p><p>\u201cAh, that explains it,\u201d Charlotte said, holding back a smile as she hooked her arm through Ben\u2019s. What she appreciated most about him was his gratitude for the little things she did\u2014and, of course, everything he did for her. He seemed to genuinely enjoy her company and, while they didn\u2019t live in each other\u2019s hip pockets, he often accompanied her on outings. Grocery shopping was a good example. Ben seemed to actually like driving her around town, and she was grateful not to have to do it herself. He loved her children and grandchildren, too.</p><p>Recently he\u2019d been in contact with his ex-daughter-in law, David\u2019s first wife and the mother of a little girl. Ben didn\u2019t want to lose touch with his granddaughter and had taken to calling her every week.</p><p>\u201cI thought we\u2019d pick up some fresh clams for dinner,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything you do with clams is bound to be delicious,\u201d Ben commented.</p><p>As they waited their turn at the popular fishmonger\u2019s, Cliff Harding came up beside them.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Cliff,\u201d Charlotte said delightedly. She\u2019d met Cliff five years earlier through his grandfather, Tom Harding, better known as the Yodeling Cowboy of 1930s and 40s movie fame. These days Cliff was considered almost family. Now that he was married to Grace, Olivia\u2019s lifelong friend, Charlotte felt a special closeness to him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking well,\u201d Charlotte said, accepting his hug. \u201cMarried life seems to agree with you.\u201d</p><p>Cliff grinned a bit sheepishly. \u201cA man could easily get accustomed to having a wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t have said it better myself,\u201d Ben murmured.</p><p>\u201cIs Grace still at the shelter booth?\u201d Charlotte asked, glancing around.</p><p>Cliff nodded toward the far corner of the market. \u201cYup. She\u2019s trying to get a couple more of those kittens adopted out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you heard from Cal?\u201d Ben asked.</p><p>Charlotte was curious, too. Cliff and Grace had had a send-off party for him before he went to Wyoming. It had been a lovely evening complete with a barbecue and buffet. Charlotte was furious about the slaughter of those horses, and she felt grateful that Cliff and Cal cared enough to take action. She\u2019d made a healthy contribution to one of the adoption facilities. Because of Grace, the local animal shelter had heard about the plight of the mustangs, too, and collected several hundred dollars\u2019 worth of donations.</p><p>\u201cCal keeps in touch as often as he can. He\u2019s linked up with a rancher in the area, and there\u2019s lots of interest from folks here in Cedar Cove. Vicki Newman, the vet, has decided to volunteer, too. Some of these mustangs are in dire need of medical attention. She has a new partner, who agreed Vicki should go, so she\u2019s meeting Cal there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great. When do you expect him back?\u201d Charlotte knew Linnette McAfee missed Cal terribly. Corrie, her mom, had mentioned it when Charlotte had seen her and Peggy Belden at lunch recently.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say for sure,\u201d Cliff told her. \u201cHe checks in whenever he can, but apparently he\u2019s in an area that doesn\u2019t get good cell phone reception. Sometimes I don\u2019t hear from him for three or four days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I for one think what you\u2019re doing is a great thing,\u201d Ben said heartily.</p><p>Charlotte nodded. \u201cI know Cal\u2019s the one who\u2019s actually out there in the wild west, but you\u2019re just as involved, Cliff, since you\u2019re paying him and he\u2019s using your horse trailer and you\u2019re going to adopt some of those mustangs. I\u2019m proud of you, Cliff.\u201d</p><p>By the time they\u2019d finished chatting, and purchased the fresh clams, rain had started to fall. \u201cWe\u2019d better head home before we get soaked,\u201d Ben told her when Cliff had hurried off.</p><p>The walk up the hill from the waterfront left Charlotte a bit breathless. \u201cI think I\u2019ll heat up some tomato soup for lunch,\u201d she said as they neared the house.</p><p>\u201cWith toasted cheese sandwiches?\u201d Ben asked.</p><p>\u201cIf you like.\u201d</p><p>The gentle pressure from his arm around her waist said it was exactly what he\u2019d like. This man loved a good meal and so, for that matter, did she.</p><p>Harry, her guard cat, was waiting impatiently when they returned to the house. He peered out from the safety of the doorway and promptly went back to his spot on top of the sofa, where he curled up and resumed his sleep.</p><p>After unpacking their purchases and drying off, Charlotte put the leftover soup on the stove and got out bread for sandwiches. When the doorbell rang, she let Ben answer it. Curious, she stuck her head around the kitchen door a moment later to see who\u2019d decided to visit at lunchtime. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ben\u2019s son, David, stood on the porch.</p><p>\u201cDavid!\u201d she burst out before she could stop herself.</p><p>Her husband hesitated, then invited him in.</p><p>\u201cThis is unexpected,\u201d Ben said, and if David didn\u2019t notice Ben\u2019s lack of welcome, Charlotte did.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re just in time for lunch.\u201d Charlotte felt obliged to include him. \u201cI have homemade tomato basil soup and toasted cheddar cheese sandwiches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure my son has other plans,\u201d Ben said, his voice unemotional.</p><p>David, impeccably dressed as always, looked uncertain. \u201cI can stay,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t want to intrude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you\u2019re not intruding! Now what brings you to Cedar Cove?\u201d Charlotte asked, joining her husband.</p><p>David seemed surprised by the question. \u201cI came to visit you. I was in Seattle on business, and it\u2019s been several months since we saw each other. I felt I should at least make an effort to visit my own father.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat a good idea,\u201d Charlotte said, leading him to the sofa. \u201cLunch will be ready in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Charlotte.\u201d He sent her a smile. David Rhodes was an attractive man, but unfortunately she\u2019d discovered that he wasn\u2019t to be trusted. It was a sad reality they had to come to terms with. Still, he was Ben\u2019s son and as such, was welcome in her home.</p><p>Remaining stoic and unemotional, Ben sat down opposite his son. \u201cI appreciate the check, David,\u201d he said after an awkward silence. He leaned back in his chair, crossing his arms. \u201cHowever, it bounced.\u201d</p><p>David\u2019s eyes flew open as though in shock. \u201cOh, my goodness, Dad, I\u2019m really sorry. I had no idea. Why didn\u2019t you say anything?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte wanted to stay and listen, but she dared not or their lunch would be ruined. As quickly as she could, she ladled out three bowls of soup and cut up the sandwiches, then arranged peanut butter cookies on a plate.</p><p>\u201cLunch is ready,\u201d she announced, carrying two soup bowls into the dining room.</p> <p>Ben came to help her, but not David, who eagerly took his seat at the table. Charlotte returned for the platter of sandwiches, and Ben followed with the third soup bowl and the cookies.</p><p>David immediately started his meal until his father stopped him. \u201cWe say grace before we eat.\u201d</p><p>Somewhat embarrassed, David set his spoon aside and bowed his head while his father said a few simple words of thanksgiving. David then had the good sense to wait until Charlotte reached for her spoon before he took up his own. She did so want to think well of Ben\u2019s son and could see that he was trying.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll write you another check,\u201d David insisted after he\u2019d finished his soup, on which he\u2019d complimented Charlotte any number of times.</p><p>Ben didn\u2019t encourage him, nor did he refuse his son\u2019s offer.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re staying in Seattle, David?\u201d she asked, making conversation.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI\u2019m at a hotel downtown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long will you be there?\u201d Charlotte asked next, wanting to cover the uncomfortable silence.</p> <p>\u201cI leave tomorrow. Say,\u201d David said, \u201con my way into town, I drove past the waterfront. What happened to The Lighthouse restaurant? It\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was destroyed by a fire,\u201d Ben responded, \u201cthat seems to have been set by an arsonist.\u201d</p><p>David\u2019s brows shot up and he leaned forward. \u201cHere in Cedar Cove? That\u2019s hard to believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was terribly shocking,\u201d Charlotte agreed. \u201cPoor Justine and Seth have been beside themselves. Until everything\u2019s settled, Justine is working part-time at the bank and Seth has taken a sales job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the fire? Is there a suspect?\u201d</p><p>Ben exhaled slowly, as though loath to discuss the subject. \u201cA high-school boy appears to be responsible. The sheriff has called Anson Butler a \u2018person of interest.\u2019 The boy hasn\u2019t been seen since the fire and apparently Seth let him go shortly beforehand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone in town is heartbroken for Seth and Justine,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll rebuild soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel bad for them,\u201d David said, sounding sincere. \u201cI hope everything works out for your granddaughter, Charlotte.\u201d</p><p>She was touched by his words and thanked David. \u201cA cookie?\u201d she asked, passing him the plate.</p><p>David took two.</p><p>Before he left, he wrote his father another check. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be more embarrassed, Dad,\u201d he said. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have any problem with this one.\u201d He shifted his eyes from Ben to Charlotte, then stared at the floor. \u201cYou might want to wait until the first of the month, though, if that\u2019s not inconvenient.\u201d</p><p>Again Ben didn\u2019t comment. He accepted the check, nodded his head at David\u2019s request and walked his son to the door.</p><p>\u201cNext time, let us know when you plan to stop by,\u201d Charlotte chastised him gently. \u201cThat way I can make you a real dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Charlotte,\u201d David said, kissing her cheek. \u201cNext visit, I\u2019ll give you plenty of notice.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte and Ben stood out on the porch with him. It was cool, and the drizzle continued. Ben put his arm around her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cCome and see us again soon,\u201d she said as David ran to his car. She waited until he\u2019d started the engine and driven off before she went back inside, Ben at her heels.</p><p>\u201cIt was good of David to stop by,\u201d she commented, watching her husband closely.</p><p>\u201cLike you said, David should\u2019ve let us know he was coming,\u201d Ben murmured. He helped her clear the table. \u201cFrankly, it would\u2019ve suited me just fine if he hadn\u2019t bothered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen! That\u2019s a terrible thing to say about your own son.\u201d</p><p>Her husband shook his head. \u201cI know David.\u201d With that, he reached for the check his son had given him and tore it in several pieces. \u201cThis is as worthless as the first one he wrote.\u201d Ben\u2019s eyes filled with pain as he crumpled the scraps and dropped them in the garbage.</p><p>Charlotte walked over to him and slipped her arms around his neck. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about this,\u201d she whispered, wishing she knew how to ease the ache in his heart.</p><p>\u201cSo am I,\u201d Ben said, holding her close. \u201cSo am I.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-Five</p><p>The morning before the senior prom, Allison drove into Silverdale to pick up her dress. She\u2019d dreamed that Anson would be her date on prom night. That wasn\u2019t possible, but rather than stay home feeling depressed, she was attending with her friend Kaci. Her parents didn\u2019t understand why she\u2019d refused to go with any of the three boys who\u2019d invited her, and Allison knew her mother was disappointed on her behalf.</p><p>Her cell phone rang as she walked through the mall to the parking lot, the dress draped over her arm. She\u2019d purchased the cell with her own funds, hoping against hope to get the number to Anson so they could talk privately. So far, there hadn\u2019t been any opportunity. He hadn\u2019t phoned her again and his mother had no way of getting in touch with him, either.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said as she walked toward her mother\u2019s car, expecting to hear Kaci\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cAllison?\u201d</p><p>She stopped cold. It was Anson.</p><p>\u201cCan you talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, hardly able to believe it. Despite her fears, her heart did a little jig of happiness. She had so much to tell him, so much she wanted to ask.</p><p>\u201cAre you alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m in the parking lot outside the Silverdale Mall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Before he told her anything else, she had to warn him. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me where you are. All right? I\u2019d have to tell the sheriff, so it\u2019s better that I not know. You aren\u2019t on a phone that can be traced, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank goodness.\u201d She breathed easier. \u201cHow did you get my number?\u201d she asked. His call seemed like the answer to a prayer, the granting of a wish, but she didn\u2019t think it was the result of either divine intervention or fairy-tale magic.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll explain in a minute. There\u2019s something I have to say first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably going to the prom tomorrow night,\u201d he said, \u201cand I want you to go. It\u2019s important to me that you do. I don\u2019t want you sitting home alone because of me. If you think you\u2019re being loyal to me by staying away, then don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Her throat hurt as she held back tears, and she found it hard to swallow, hard to speak. She was moved beyond words that he cared about her...that he\u2019d even remembered the dance. \u201cI\u2019m going with Kaci,\u201d she finally said. Because of all the traffic noise outside the mall, she unlocked the car and sat in the driver\u2019s seat. She tossed her dress on the empty space beside her.</p><p>\u201cBut Allison...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my date, Anson. I can\u2019t imagine dancing at the prom with anyone but you.\u201d Closing her eyes, she could almost feel his arms around her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d give anything to be there with you,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Her heart felt like it was about to break. \u201cHow did you get my number?\u201d she asked again, trying to maintain some semblance of control.</p><p>\u201cEddie. I had a friend phone the house pretending to be a guy from school and Eddie answered and gave him the number of your cell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that I have my own phone, can you talk more often?\u201d She had so many questions. Although she was desperate to ask about the pewter cross found in the fire, she was also afraid of what he might tell her. All she needed now, she decided, was the sound of his voice. The questions could wait.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s a good idea for me to call you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cPlease! I have to know you\u2019re all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay. There\u2019s nothing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do worry, Anson.\u201d She wanted him to come back to Cedar Cove, and yet she was terrified of what might happen when\u2014if\u2014he did. A part of her yearned to tell him to stay hidden, otherwise he might end up in jail. At the same time, she longed for his name to be cleared. Only she wasn\u2019t convinced anymore that was possible....</p><p>\u201cWhat can you tell me about The Lighthouse?\u201d he asked. \u201cIs there any news? Has anyone been arrested?\u201d</p><p>Allison closed her eyes again, fearing this very subject. She hesitated.</p><p>\u201cAllison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour cross was found in the ashes. It\u2019d partially melted and there was a picture of it in the Chronicle.\u201d</p><p>He muttered something best not repeated.</p><p>\u201cYou were there that night, weren\u2019t you?\u201d Asking him this required all the courage she could muster. Her hand was trembling and damp with perspiration as she clutched the phone.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I swear to you, Allison, I didn\u2019t set the fire. I did everything I could to put it out. I realized I\u2019d lost my cross, but I didn\u2019t know where. Tell the sheriff to check the fire extinguisher. My fingerprints should be all over it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell him,\u201d she said, eager to do anything that would help prove his innocence.</p><p>\u201cHave you lost faith in me, Allison?\u201d Before she could answer, he continued. \u201cI swear to you I had nothing to do with the fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho else could have done it?\u201d she asked rather than admit her faith had been shaken.</p><p>\u201cI saw him.\u201d Anson\u2019s voice was so low she could hardly hear it.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she said breathlessly. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d she nearly shouted. She wasn\u2019t stupid and she wasn\u2019t going to let him lie to her, either.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know his name,\u201d Anson groaned, his frustration evident. \u201cI\u2019ve seen him before, but I don\u2019t know who he is. He ate at the restaurant. But I only saw him one time and then again the night of the fire. I swear that\u2019s the truth. I shouldn\u2019t have told you this much...I don\u2019t want to involve you any more than I already have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Anson, I\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll I\u2019m asking,\u201d he said, cutting her off, \u201call I want from you is to believe me. If you can\u2019t do that, there\u2019s nothing more for me to say....\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hang up,\u201d she cried.</p><p>She heard the drone of silence and tears welled up in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cAnson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here. I should go,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo, please.\u201d She felt like she was grasping at wind.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t talk anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went to see your mother,\u201d she rushed to tell him. \u201cI understand now what you meant when you came to me that night. You said it was better if I didn\u2019t know what you\u2019d done. You meant the money you stole, didn\u2019t you?\u201d She could only hope that was all he\u2019d meant.</p><p>\u201cI took that money from my mother,\u201d Anson admitted. \u201cI\u2019m not proud of it and I\u2019ll pay back every penny. I promised I would and I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe let me read your letter,\u201d Allison told him, \u201cand I told her about your phone call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Cherry tell you about the fires I started as a kid, too?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Allison heard gruff voices in the background. She couldn\u2019t decipher what was being said, but it was clear that Anson needed to get off the phone.</p><p>\u201cYes, she told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo wonder you don\u2019t believe me,\u201d he said. \u201cListen. I didn\u2019t nearly burn the house down when I was a kid. My mother was drinking and she left a cigarette burning. She blamed me, but it was her fault. The other incident wasn\u2019t me, either. It was another kid from the neighborhood. I know this looks bad, Allison, but I swear I wasn\u2019t responsible for the fire at The Lighthouse.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want to believe you. With all my heart, Anson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he whispered and then, before she was ready, he disconnected.</p><p>Allison\u2019s hand tightened around her phone and she held on for a long moment, trying to maintain the sense of closeness they\u2019d shared.</p><p>Anson had told her far more than he had in his previous call or the night of the fire, and it gave her hope that he was telling the truth.</p><p>As she drove back to Cedar Cove, Allison\u2019s thoughts whirled in a hundred different directions. On impulse, she stopped at the First National Bank. The last time she\u2019d made a deposit, Allison had seen Justine Gunderson there.</p><p>Ms. Gunderson was talking with a client at her desk when she entered the bank. Allison sat in the waiting area until Justine was free. During that time, Allison changed her mind twice before she found the courage to approach the owner of the burned-out restaurant.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d Ms. Gunderson asked pleasantly as Allison walked toward her.</p><p>Her knees felt weak, and Allison sat down in the chair opposite Justine. \u201cI\u2019m Allison Cox,\u201d she said. Because she felt it was important to maintain a businesslike facade, she extended her hand across the desk.</p><p>Justine shook it and seemed to take her seriously, which reassured Allison. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you remember me,\u201d she said. They\u2019d met at The Light-house and at a party held by her parents a couple of Christmases ago.</p><p>She waited, but Ms. Gunderson gave no indication that she did.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Zach Cox\u2019s daughter\u2014and Anson Butler\u2019s girlfriend,\u201d she said in as straightforward a manner as she could.</p><p>Justine\u2019s eyes flickered with recognition.</p><p>\u201cI talked to Anson today. A little more than thirty minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>Justine leaned forward, her elbows on the desk. When she spoke, her voice was low and tense. \u201cDoes Anson know the sheriff wants to talk to him regarding the fire?\u201d she asked in a conspiratorial whisper.</p><p>\u201cAnson knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a reason he won\u2019t talk to the authorities?\u201d</p><p>Allison wasn\u2019t sure how to answer that. \u201cI want him to come back to Cedar Cove more than anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy husband and I realize he was upset after we laid him off.\u201d</p><p>Allison had never seen Anson more distressed than the day last autumn when he\u2019d found her in the mall. He\u2019d been so negative, convinced the world was against him. Convinced that nothing he said or did would ever be good enough.</p><p>\u201cHe was so hurt and angry when he lost his job. He didn\u2019t take that money, Ms. Gunderson. I know that. He\u2019d tried really hard to do everything right\u2014and then to be falsely accused...You can\u2019t imagine what it did to him.\u201d</p><p>Justine sighed. \u201cMy husband felt bad about the way he handled the situation. We\u2019d never had anything like that come up before. Seth liked Anson. In fact, he\u2019d recently made him a prep cook.\u201d</p><p>Allison nodded vigorously. \u201cAnson thought he was making progress and that he\u2019d be able to pay off the shed and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe shed?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Allison lowered her eyes. \u201cHe was making restitution for the fire in the city park.\u201d</p><p>Ms. Gunderson went very quiet. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten about that,\u201d she said after a moment. She pressed her fingertips to her forehead. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to put as much of this behind me as I can. As you might\u2019ve guessed, this whole episode has been devastating for Seth and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour husband knew about Anson\u2019s past. My father talked to him about it and Mr. Gunderson agreed to give him this job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou believe in your friend, don\u2019t you?\u201d Justine said gently.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d She wanted to defend Anson, explain that he was a good and honest person and how intelligent he was. None of that made any difference, though, unless there was evidence exonerating him.</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s truly innocent, then your friend\u2019ll return of his own free will and answer the sheriff\u2019s questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to him about it,\u201d Allison said. The next time Anson phoned, she\u2019d make sure he understood how important it was to contact the authorities if he hoped to clear his name. Otherwise, this fire would hang over his head for the rest of his life. Otherwise, the entire town would lay the blame at his feet. His reputation had cast a shadow of doubt over him, and his disappearance only reinforced people\u2019s suspicions. Refusing to step forward hindered his chances.</p><p>It hindered their chances.</p><p>Twenty-Six</p><p>Linnette was waiting for her sister at the high-school track. Gloria had finally convinced her to try running, which she claimed kept her in good shape and allowed her to pass the police department\u2019s regular fitness tests.</p><p>Gloria was supposed to join her when her shift ended. Together they\u2019d do a lazy mile, she\u2019d said. Then, in a few weeks, after Linnette had built up her endurance, they\u2019d run farther. Gloria had made it sound like fun and as a physician\u2019s assistant, Linnette often advised patients on the health benefits of exercise. The least she could do was practice what she preached. Besides, seeing her fit and firm would be a nice surprise for Cal when he returned.</p><p>Gloria was only a few minutes behind her; she pulled into the lot and parked next to Linnette.</p><p>\u201cHey, you look great,\u201d Gloria said as she stepped out of her car.</p><p>Linnette did a full turn so her sister could get a complete view of her jogging suit. \u201cI should. This running outfit cost me over a hundred bucks.\u201d</p><p>Gloria rolled her eyes. \u201cYou don\u2019t need designer clothes to run\u2014an old pair of jeans and a T-shirt would\u2019ve worked fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for me. I figure that if I\u2019m going to sweat, I want to look as good as I can while I\u2019m doing it.\u201d</p><p>Shaking her head, Gloria led the way. It was late enough that the school had finished with the track, which was now open to the public. Several other runners circled it; a few more walked.</p><p>\u201cChad asked me to send his greetings,\u201d Linnette said, watching for her sister\u2019s reaction. Gloria didn\u2019t give any indication that she cared. \u201cHey, that\u2019s quite the poker face,\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mentioned Chad\u2019s name and you didn\u2019t even raise an eyebrow. When are you going to admit you\u2019re as interested in him as he is in you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to run or not?\u201d Gloria asked, ignoring the question.</p><p>\u201cRun, of course.\u201d She was looking forward to some brisk exercise and, in the process, spending time with her sister. All they seemed to do when they got together was go out for meals, which defeated her goal of getting into shape. Gloria was the one who\u2019d suggested they start running and Linnette had happily agreed.</p><p>Gloria demonstrated a few warm-up exercises.</p><p>Linnette carefully followed her instructions. \u201cHey, this is great. I feel better already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t running yet.\u201d</p><p>Linnette jumped up and down a few times, showing her sister that she had plenty of energy in reserve. \u201cLead on and don\u2019t hold back on my account,\u201d she said, gesturing dramatically at the track.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll start off nice and easy,\u201d Gloria told her. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to kill my sister, the health care professional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to have a sister, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Linnette murmured, basking in the glow of first finding a friend and then learning that friend was also her sister.</p><p>\u201cI agree\u2014a sister is a good thing,\u201d Gloria said with a smile.</p><p>They took off down the track, and to Linnette\u2019s surprise it wasn\u2019t bad. She could breathe almost normally. But by the end of the first lap, her breathing had grown heavier and her speed had decreased. \u201cHow many laps in a mile again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour.\u201d</p><p>Gloria had to be kidding. Each time around felt that far. \u201cThat was a joke, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re already a quarter there.\u201d Gloria cast her a knowing look.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t welcome news. Her lungs ached, and her legs didn\u2019t want to cooperate. She felt suddenly depressed to realize she still had three laps to go before she was finished. Besides, in addition to her aches and pains, she noticed that perspiration was running freely down her face. \u201cMaybe you were right about starting off slow and easy,\u201d Linnette managed, although it stung her pride to suggest she wasn\u2019t up to the challenge. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re practically walking now,\u201d Gloria said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we talk\u2014that\u2019ll distract you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to talk about? Chad?\u201d Linnette asked.</p><p>Once again, Gloria ignored the mention of his name. \u201cWhat do you hear from Cal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much. I talked to him this weekend. He was in a honky-tonk bar, if the background music was any indication.\u201d Linnette frowned at the memory. She might not know much about mustangs, but even as a greenhorn she was bright enough to recognize that there weren\u2019t a lot of wild horses hanging around in bars. Rethinking the conversation, she recalled a number of other things that had bothered her. \u201cWhile we were talking, Cal began to stutter again. That tells me he\u2019s tense or nervous about something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe he just needs to get back to the speech therapist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Still, Linnette didn\u2019t think that was the problem. There was something on his mind he wasn\u2019t telling her. They hardly talked anymore. When he phoned, it felt more like the fulfilling of an obligation than any desire to talk to her. A recent article in the Cedar Cove Chronicle stated that local veterinarian Vicki Newman had joined Cal. She remembered their meeting at the ranch earlier and the odd sensation that had come over her when she saw Cal talking to Vicki. She\u2019d felt threatened, and she couldn\u2019t figure out exactly why. Vicki was so...ordinary. Linnette hated to say it, but the veterinarian, with her sharp facial features, lank hair and mannish build, was downright unattractive. She seemed nice enough, Linnette supposed. But Cal hadn\u2019t told her Vicki was going to Wyoming, too, and that worried her.</p><p>During their last call, Linnette had told him how much it dismayed her, but Cal hadn\u2019t responded. Instead, he\u2019d changed the subject.</p><p>They never argued. Cal would walk away from a disagreement rather than talk about it rationally. It didn\u2019t help, she told herself, that he had a difficult time controlling his speech when he was upset, which only made him more disinclined to discuss problems.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you and Chad?\u201d Linnette asked again, rather than focus on her own relationship. \u201cYou talk about Chad and I\u2019ll discuss Cal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to talk about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you going out with him?\u201d Linnette didn\u2019t understand it.</p><p>Gloria shrugged. \u201cShould I be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I guess not,\u201d Linnette said reluctantly. And yet the two of them looked at no one else whenever they were together.</p><p>\u201cIf anyone isn\u2019t interested in Chad, it\u2019s me,\u201d Linnette said on the off-chance Gloria was denying her feelings out of misplaced loyalty to her.</p><p>\u201cThen why are we discussing him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause I know how he feels about you.\u201d</p><p>Gloria increased her pace, and Linnette had to struggle to keep up. \u201cHey, slow down, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if you want to talk about Chad.\u201d</p><p>Linnette frowned, blinking as the sweat slid down her face. \u201cAm I missing something here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Gloria\u2019s response was much too quick.</p><p>Linnette was nearly panting in her effort to keep pace with her sister, who seemed to be trying to break a world speed record. \u201cMaybe it\u2019d be best if we didn\u2019t talk,\u201d she suggested, breathing heavily.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Gloria agreed and immediately slowed to a kinder pace.</p><p>\u201cThis was supposed to be a lazy mile,\u201d Linnette reminded her.</p> <p>Round two was completed, and two more remained. It would be a miracle if she managed four full laps.</p><p>\u201cA lazy mile doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to crawl,\u201d Gloria snapped.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had more practice at this than I have.\u201d Linnette tried not to sound apologetic.</p><p>\u201cI thought we weren\u2019t going to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to talk.\u201d Linnette couldn\u2019t stop, much as she\u2019d prefer to. If she did, then all she\u2019d think about was how much her body didn\u2019t want to do this. Her calf muscles were about to spasm. Her face burned, her stomach had begun to churn with nausea. \u201cHow often do you come out here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cEvery day. I run between three and five miles.\u201d</p><p>Linnette groaned. \u201cYou just said that to make me feel bad, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Gloria laughed, raced ahead, then spun around and ran backward, facing Linnette. \u201cHey, are we having our first sisterly disagreement?\u201d</p><p>If she\u2019d had the energy, Linnette would\u2019ve laughed, too. \u201cYeah, I think we are.\u201d Seeing that she was holding Gloria up, she gestured for her to run on. \u201cLeave me,\u201d she panted. \u201cI\u2019ll walk these last two laps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo, before I require resuscitation.\u201d</p><p>Gloria grinned and took off at a speed that would\u2019ve caused Linnette to have a cardiac arrest. As she\u2019d promised, she continued walking, astonished at Gloria who literally ran circles around her. Actually, now that she was moving at a relaxed speed, Linnette found she didn\u2019t object to exercising.</p><p>Without Gloria there to distract her, though, her mind was free to roam. But the subject in the forefront of her thoughts was an uncomfortable one.</p><p>Cal.</p><p>While his mission was undeniably noble, he\u2019d seemed too eager to get away from Cedar Cove\u2014away from her. Her brother, Mack, had warned her that she was suffocating him. At the time, Linnette hadn\u2019t been willing to listen, but now she felt she had to give his words some heed.</p><p>When she rounded the last curve, Linnette was surprised to see Chad standing outside the fence, watching them. When he looked in her direction, she waved. He returned her greeting, but his gaze immediately went to Gloria. In that brief moment, Linnette saw such longing in his eyes that it took her aback.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what to think. Was it possible they were already involved? Yet that didn\u2019t make sense. Chad would\u2019ve mentioned it, she was sure, since they worked together every day.</p><p>Gloria was certainly closemouthed, but Linnette resolved to mind her own business from now on. She couldn\u2019t figure out what was happening in her own relationship, so she hardly felt qualified to diagnose the problems between Gloria and Chad.</p><p>After the evening meal at Lonny Ellison\u2019s Wyoming ranch, where they were staying as guests, Cal found Vicki outside, standing at the corral. He hesitated before joining her. They\u2019d been working together twelve and fifteen hours a day for two weeks now. His new feelings had crept up on him unawares. She\u2019d been around Cliff\u2019s ranch from the time he\u2019d hired on, and they\u2019d always been friendly but nothing more. He wasn\u2019t sure when it\u2019d happened, but Vicki had become someone who mattered to him. Maybe it had started the week he left, when they\u2019d met to make plans for this trip....</p><p>Vicki ignored him and rested her arms on the top rung. She stared straight ahead as several of the mustangs dashed around inside the pen, snorting at their unaccustomed boundaries, kicking up dust and generally letting their displeasure be known.</p><p>\u201cIt was a mistake for me to come to Wyoming,\u201d she said without looking at him.</p><p>Cal couldn\u2019t let her think that. \u201cNo. You\u2019ve been a real asset.\u201d He began to remind her of everything she\u2019d done for the mustangs, but she stopped him.</p><p>\u201cIt was a mistake for other reasons,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Cal.\u201d</p><p>She still hadn\u2019t looked at him.</p><p>He swallowed hard. He refused to believe that she shouldn\u2019t be there\u2014or that she was sorry. Although he\u2019d been careful to avoid touching her, he couldn\u2019t keep from doing so now. He placed his hand on her shoulder and watched as her eyes drifted shut, as if she, too, was fighting their strong physical attraction. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean for this to happen,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to turn in for the night,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he pleaded. \u201cNot yet.\u201d He moved closer, stroking her hair with his other hand.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand!\u201d she said, breaking free.</p><p>\u201cUnderstand what?\u201d Despite the desire to pull her back into his arms, he let her step out of his embrace.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he pressed.</p><p>She held his gaze until her own eyes filled with tears. \u201cYou really don\u2019t know, do you?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cKnow what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Cal, how could you be so blind? I\u2019ve been in love with you for two years!\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t have shocked him more if she\u2019d poked him with a cattle prod. His mouth fell open, but he couldn\u2019t speak for at least a minute. He just gawked at her.</p><p>\u201cYou never let on,\u201d he said numbly.</p><p>\u201cHow could I?\u201d she asked, jerking her hand across her face, smearing the tears. \u201cI...I didn\u2019t know how, and then you started seeing Linnette and she\u2019s so lovely and I\u2019m\u2014well, I\u2019m not. Why do you think I didn\u2019t want to go on this trip at first?\u201d</p><p>Cal hated to appear dense, but apparently he was exactly that. \u201cI\u2014thought it had s-something to do with your office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only said that because I was afraid I wouldn\u2019t be able to hide my feelings, and now look what\u2019s happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happened,\u201d Cal said, exhaling sharply, \u201cis that I\u2019ve fallen in love with you, too.\u201d</p><p>He had no idea how Vicki would accept this news; however, he didn\u2019t expect her to lash out with her fist and clobber him in the chest. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare say that to me, Cal Washburn! Don\u2019t you dare!\u201d She punctuated each word with another solid punch.</p><p>\u201cOuch.\u201d Cal backed away and rubbed his chest, confounded by the vehemence of her attack. \u201cOw, dammit. What did you do that for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you touch me again, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought\u2014I hoped you shared my f-feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d she muttered, \u201cbut that doesn\u2019t change the fact that Linnette\u2019s in Cedar Cove patiently waiting for your return. What about her? She loves you, too.\u201d</p><p>Cal felt the color drain from his face. Vicki was right. He had no business declaring his feelings or kissing her until he\u2019d resolved the situation with Linnette. The problem was, he had no idea how to do that.</p><p>Twenty-Seven</p><p>Memorial Day, Cecilia got up early, even before Aaron woke her for his feeding. Not wanting to disturb Ian, she got quietly out of bed and pulled on her robe. Then she tiptoed into the kitchen to make a pot of coffee. The clock on the microwave told her it was barely five. Nevertheless she was wide awake.</p><p>A quick check on the baby assured her that Aaron was sound asleep. Taking these few moments to herself, savoring the silence, Cecilia poured a mug of coffee and sat in her favorite chair in the living room. She was happy, she realized, truly content with her life. Memorial Day was a little less sad this year, mostly because she had Aaron. For the past six years she\u2019d dreaded this day because it reminded her of the most profound loss she\u2019d ever experienced\u2014the death of her daughter, Allison. For six years, her arms and her heart had ached for the baby she\u2019d held so briefly. Her son would never replace Allison, but she loved him just as much. Her grief no longer seemed as raw, as overwhelming. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A year ago on Memorial Day, when Cecilia was still pregnant with Aaron, and Ian had been at sea, she\u2019d driven out to the cemetery and placed flowers on Allison\u2019s gravesite. The loss of her little girl still affected her, and Ian, too, although he wasn\u2019t as willing to discuss the subject as she was. Every now and then in the middle of the night, he\u2019d reach for her and they\u2019d talk about Allison. She could never doubt Ian\u2019s love for the daughter he\u2019d never seen or held.</p><p>\u201cCecilia?\u201d Ian said groggily. He stood in the hall doorway wearing his pajama bottoms. \u201cWhat are you doing up so early?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was awake and it\u2019s such a lovely morning, I decided to get up.\u201d She was hoping to do a bit of yard work later, after they\u2019d been out to the cemetery. She\u2019d started tending the garden and hoped to coax Grace\u2019s rosebushes and perennials back to vibrant life. She longed to show the Hardings how well she and Ian were caring for the house and yard.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only about five,\u201d Ian said.</p> <p>\u201cI know. Why don\u2019t you go back to bed?\u201d She had plans for him later and didn\u2019t want him telling her he was too tired.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked, sounding worried.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t look as if he believed her.</p><p>\u201cIan,\u201d she said, smiling softly. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be happier. I love you and our babies so much, and Aaron is healthy and thriving. We live in a lovely home. My life\u2019s never been better.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBabies,\u201d Ian repeated carefully.</p><p>\u201cYes, babies.\u201d Allison would always live in Cecilia\u2019s heart, would always be her daughter.</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re going to the cemetery today,\u201d he said.</p><p>Cecilia had already purchased a small bouquet of flowers. She nodded. \u201cI have every year. I couldn\u2019t imagine not going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, neither,\u201d Ian concurred sadly. He yawned and turned away, then walked into the room with slow, measured steps. To her surprise, he sat down on the nearby ottoman, his shoulders slumped.</p><p>Cecilia leaned forward and placed her hand on his bare back, pressing a kiss to his shoulder. He didn\u2019t say anything for a long time. Long enough for her to recognize that he had something on his mind. Something that weighed on him.</p> <p>\u201cIan?\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer; instead, he stared down at the floor.</p><p>\u201cIan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been transferred.\u201d</p><p>The words hung in the air. Ian transferred?</p><p>Cecilia swallowed hard, trying to make sense of what he was telling her. Ian had been stationed at the same base for nearly six years, two more years than the usual four-year assignment. Those two extra years could be attributed to the fact that he\u2019d moved from a submarine to an aircraft carrier.</p><p>After Allison\u2019s death, the navy had given him a new duty assignment. Because Ian had been under the polar ice cap at the time of Allison\u2019s birth, he hadn\u2019t even known until his return that his daughter had been born, had died and already been buried. He\u2019d suffered severe emotional trauma as a result.</p><p>\u201cWe have to move?\u201d Cecilia asked, choking off an automatic protest. The day they\u2019d come to view the house, Ian had said they couldn\u2019t sign a full year\u2019s lease. He\u2019d said there was a rumor they might be transferred. Cecilia had known it was a possibility, only she\u2019d convinced herself it wouldn\u2019t really happen.</p> <p>Ian had told her when they were first married that the navy might require frequent moves. But Cedar Cove was their home. It was where they\u2019d met, where they\u2019d fallen in love and married, and where they\u2014</p><p>No. Bile rose in the back of her throat. Their daughter was buried here. A transfer meant they\u2019d be leaving Allison behind.</p><p>\u201cI put off telling you as long as I could,\u201d he mumbled. \u201cI was afraid one of the other wives would say something, and I didn\u2019t want you hearing this from anyone else. The George Washington\u2019s new home base is San Diego.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like that, we have to pack up and leave?\u201d she said in a small voice.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Cecilia.\u201d He shrugged helplessly. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Allison? Who\u2019ll visit her grave? Who\u2019ll make sure it\u2019s properly taken care of if we\u2019re not here?\u201d Fears and denials crowded her mind but she quickly swallowed a cry of alarm. This had to be hard on Ian, too, and her dissolving into tears wouldn\u2019t change anything.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to tell you. All I can say is that the navy\u2019s sending us to another duty station. When I signed my name on the enlistment agreement, I knew this was bound to happen sooner or later. You knew it, too.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia did. Two weeks ago, her closest friend, Cathy Lackey, had revealed that her husband had received transfer papers that would send the small family to Scotland. Cecilia and Cathy had shed a lot of tears, but they\u2019d vowed to keep in touch through e-mail and letters. Cecilia was determined to hold on to that precious friendship.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the house?\u201d she asked next. They\u2019d only just settled in; the packing boxes were still in the garage. Cecilia loved this house, and so did Ian. \u201cI thought we might own it one day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Her husband sounded as miserable as she felt. \u201cWe are on a month-to-month agreement, though. I\u2019ve already spoken to Mrs. Harding. She was disappointed, too, but she understood.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia hardly knew what to say. She\u2019d be walking away from the friends she\u2019d made, the daughter she\u2019d buried, the job she enjoyed and the teenage girl she\u2019d befriended. Everything\u2014her whole life\u2014was here in Cedar Cove.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll like San Diego,\u201d Ian said gamely.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I will,\u201d she murmured with no particular enthusiasm.</p><p>When Ian spoke again, his voice was void of emotion. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing a lot of thinking, and I know how much you love it here.\u201d He paused. \u201cIf you wanted, you could stay,\u201d he suggested with obvious reluctance. \u201cI could make the commute for a while. I\u2019m at sea for six months\u2014and, well, there are ways around this if you don\u2019t feel you can uproot your life and leave Allison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Ian.\u201d That would be disastrous for their marriage. She needed to be with her husband, regardless of where he was assigned. They were a family.</p><p>\u201cIs that what you\u2019d like to do?\u201d he asked, his eyes intense and sad as he studied her.</p><p>\u201cI hate leaving Cedar Cove,\u201d she said softly, rubbing her hand down his bare back. \u201cBut Ian, don\u2019t you see? I could never live apart from you.\u201d She managed a shaky laugh. \u201cAt least, not any more than the navy already requires.\u201d</p><p>He brought his arms around her then, and they clung to each other. Words weren\u2019t necessary. He wanted her and Aaron with him, and yet he\u2019d been willing to compromise, to give her what he felt would make her happy.</p><p>\u201cI love you so much,\u201d he whispered. \u201cYou have no idea how much I dreaded telling you this.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t made it easy, Cecilia realized. Every day she\u2019d been full of joy about the house and working hard to make it comfortable and welcoming.</p><p>\u201cWe can start packing this afternoon,\u201d she said, tears spilling from her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go visit Allison first.\u201d</p><p>Yes, and while she was there, Cecilia would tell her baby girl goodbye.</p><p>Twenty-Eight</p><p>Justine glanced at her watch, surprised it was almost noon. With a staff meeting and back-to-back appointments, the morning had gotten away from her. She grabbed her purse and hurried out from behind her desk. She should\u2019ve left ten minutes ago. She was meeting Seth and their insurance agent at The Lighthouse, or rather where The Lighthouse used to be. The site had been cleared now, and decisions needed to be made.</p><p>As Justine headed out, she nearly collided with Warren Saget, who was just entering the bank.</p><p>\u201cJustine,\u201d he said catching her by the shoulders. \u201cI almost bowled you over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWarren,\u201d she said, nearly breathless. \u201cOh, my goodness, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m in a rush\u2014I\u2019m supposed to meet Seth and our insurance agent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d His face fell, his disappointment obvious. \u201cI was hoping to convince you to have lunch with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she told him. \u201cI have to run. I\u2019m already late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill the meeting take long? I could wait.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to hurt his feelings, but Seth had asked her not to see Warren again. Her mother had been critical of her, too, for that one lunch meeting. Olivia didn\u2019t know the nature of her relationship with Warren, although Seth, of course, did. Warren was impotent, and they\u2019d been friends who\u2019d provided each other with certain mutual benefits, including company in social or business situations.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be at D.D.\u2019s on the Cove,\u201d Warren told her as she started backing away from him. \u201cThey do marvelous crab cakes. That was your favorite entr\u00e9e, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou go on ahead,\u201d she told him, eager to get away. She realized she hadn\u2019t explicitly turned him down.</p><p>\u201cMeet me if you can,\u201d he said.</p><p>Justine nodded and, because she was late, decided to drive rather than walk. She rushed across the parking lot where she\u2019d left her car. Seth had been so busy at the boatyard lately that they hadn\u2019t had a chance to discuss their plans for the restaurant. She still had mixed feelings about rebuilding. The restaurant was too demanding; it took too much time away from their family life.</p><p>Tragic and distressing as the arson had been, she loved the freedom the last few months had given her. Seth was doing so well in sales, and each commission he collected was more than they\u2019d cleared in any single month at the restaurant. In her heart of hearts, she hoped Seth would see that rebuilding The Lighthouse would be too hard on them. At the same time, she understood what he was saying about not wasting all the effort of the last five years. Besides, she had an idea, one she\u2019d come up with during a recent visit at her mother\u2019s and briefly discussed with Seth. He seemed to listen but she wasn\u2019t convinced that he\u2019d truly grasped her vision.</p><p>Seth and Robert Beckman, their insurance agent, were already at the site. Justine parked and hurried across the street to join them. The view of the cove was dramatic and beautiful, part of the reason this was such a valuable piece of real estate.</p><p>When she approached Seth and Robert, they were deep in conversation, pausing only to smile at her. Still speaking, her husband put his arm around her waist and brought her close.</p><p>\u201cRobert was just saying he\u2019s reviewed the architect\u2019s plans,\u201d he told Justine. \u201cWith a fresh start, we can make some necessary changes and update the old floor plan.\u201d</p><p>Justine unsuccessfully hid her surprise. Construction plans? No one had mentioned any of this to her. \u201cI have a few ideas of my own,\u201d she inserted.</p><p>\u201cBecause of the fire,\u201d Seth said, ignoring her comment, \u201cwe have the opportunity of a lifetime.\u201d He grinned wryly. \u201cIronic, huh?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She understood what he meant. They\u2019d purchased the old Captain\u2019s Galley restaurant and done extensive renovations before opening and renaming it The Lighthouse. Even with all the money they\u2019d sunk into the business, they were stuck with the original floor plan and kitchen. Rebuilding from the ground up gave them the opportunity to change everything. \u201cWhat about my idea?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat about the tearoom I told you about?\u201d</p><p>Seth frowned and went right on speaking. \u201cRobert\u2019s saying that in the rebuild, we can add a banquet room, which I\u2019d already discussed with the architect. We can do the things we dreamed of doing. You could make the banquet room a tearoom, too, if that\u2019s what you want,\u201d he said, in an obvious concession to her. The longer he spoke the more animated he became.</p><p>\u201cNot a restaurant like we had before,\u201d she said, refusing to let go of the idea. \u201cBut a tearoom for women in the area. This has nothing to do with adding a banquet room,\u201d she said slowly.</p><p>\u201cFor women?\u201d Seth repeated. \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t work. When we rebuild, it\u2019ll be a whole new Lighthouse. Can\u2019t you just see it?\u201d he asked, smiling down at her. \u201cWe\u2019ll have the banquet room we\u2019ve always wanted.\u201d</p> <p>Again and again Seth had bemoaned the fact that The Lighthouse didn\u2019t have an area large enough to hold private banquets. He\u2019d made the most of the space they had. But the restaurant lacked the facilities for wedding receptions and when they\u2019d hosted any big occasions\u2014like the charity auction and her grandmother Charlotte\u2019s wedding\u2014they\u2019d been required to close the restaurant.</p><p>\u201cYou know how badly we need a banquet room,\u201d her husband said again, puzzled at her decided lack of enthusiasm.</p><p>Justine didn\u2019t answer. In talking to Robert about rebuilding\u2014and this was obviously not the first such conversation\u2014Seth made it clear that he hadn\u2019t heard a single thing she\u2019d said in the last two and a half months.</p><p>\u201cJustine?\u201d Seth studied her, frowning slightly.</p><p>Pointedly she looked away from him. \u201cActually I can see I\u2019m not needed here. You two appear to have everything under control. I was invited to lunch, so if you\u2019ll both excuse me I\u2019ll join my friend.\u201d Before Seth could question her or object, she left. If she hadn\u2019t been so angry, Justine would\u2019ve burst into tears; as it was, she was fighting for her composure.</p> <p>When she reached her car, she heard hard footsteps coming up behind her. She turned to find Seth.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t even listening to me,\u201d she said, unable to hide the hurt she felt. \u201cI really think my idea would work, Seth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not letting the last five years go down the drain so you can build a tearoom for a bunch of bored women. If we\u2019re going to rebuild, it needs to be something that involves me, too. I want to make The Lighthouse what it was always meant to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you go ahead and do that.\u201d Her voice remained calm, belying her anger.</p><p>\u201cYou think a tearoom\u2019s actually going to be some kind of improvement?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I do. Don\u2019t you understand, Seth? I\u2019ve seen more of you these last few months than I have in years. Leif is thriving. He loves having both his parents around for more than an hour a day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re exaggerating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I, Seth?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, as if he couldn\u2019t make sense of what she was telling him. \u201cThis is a golden opportunity for us. It\u2019s not the time to consider doing something else. We have a chance to start over\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen do it,\u201d she broke in, glaring at him. \u201cJust do it. If you want The Lighthouse back so badly, then rebuild.\u201d She nearly choked on the words as she whirled around and opened her door.</p><p>Seth looked utterly perplexed as she slipped inside her car, thrust the key into the ignition and drove off. In her rearview mirror, she saw him standing at the side of the street, staring after her.</p><p>Her hands trembled and she bit her lip hard. She was hurt and angry and wanted to lash out at him. He objected to her seeing Warren? Well, too bad. Warren was her friend and at the moment he seemed to be a better one than her own husband.</p><p>She walked into the foyer at D.D\u2019s on the Cove, then scanned the room. Warren sat at a table next to the window, facing the front of the restaurant. When he saw her, he brightened visibly. He stood, and came eagerly toward her.</p> <p>\u201cJustine,\u201d he said meeting her at the entrance. \u201cI hoped you\u2019d come.\u201d He kissed her on the cheek and steered her toward his table. Every eye in the room was on them.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t a small, out-of-the-way caf\u00e9 like the place they\u2019d met before. Soon everyone in town would be talking about her and Warren. So be it.</p><p>The instant they reached the table, he pulled out her chair with a flourish. Next he got the waitress\u2019s attention and asked for a menu. Justine felt a small shock as she recognized Diana, who\u2019d worked as a waitress at The Lighthouse. They exchanged a few stilted words, and Justine hoped Diana wouldn\u2019t mention her presence here\u2014with Warren\u2014to anyone who might know her mother. Crazy as it sounded, she worried more about Olivia finding out than Seth. Her husband could not have made it plainer that he didn\u2019t care about her feelings, so she couldn\u2019t see any reason to be too concerned about his.</p><p>\u201cWould you like a glass of wine?\u201d Warren asked as she glanced over the menu.</p><p>\u201cThe way I feel right now, you can order an entire bottle.\u201d</p><p>Warren\u2019s laughter pleased her. \u201cThen I will.\u201d</p><p>He did, and he didn\u2019t spare any expense, either, choosing a sixty-dollar bottle of chardonnay.</p><p>Despite her lack of appetite, Justine ordered the crab cakes and a small salad.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Warren said, leaning toward her. \u201cTell me what happened.\u201d</p><p>She waited until her wineglass had been filled. \u201cOh, Warren. I\u2019m so upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can tell,\u201d he said, immediately solicitous.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Seth. He wants to rebuild the restaurant. I\u2019d talked to him about another idea and he completely ignored me.\u201d</p><p>He seemed a little surprised himself. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to rebuild?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot The Lighthouse. Not the way it was.\u201d If what her mother had said was true and Warren was trying to get on her good side, hoping to be awarded the construction contract, he\u2019d take her husband\u2019s part in this. \u201cFor the first time since we opened The Lighthouse,\u201d she explained, \u201cSeth and I have time together like a normal couple. Leif is doing so well. The Lighthouse was strangling us, and now that we\u2019ve been without it, I don\u2019t want to return to that kind of life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the restaurant was your livelihood,\u201d Warren said, immediately siding with her husband. \u201cIt\u2019s only natural that Seth wouldn\u2019t want to give up his only source of income.\u201d</p><p>So, maybe Olivia was right, and Warren did have an agenda. \u201cIt used to be our livelihood, but Seth went to work for Larry Boone and he\u2019s making more money as a salesman than we ever did with the restaurant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Warren murmured thoughtfully. \u201cHave you told Seth how you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made my feelings very clear.\u201d Had Seth already forgotten the endlessly long hours and the constant struggle to meet their expenses and still make a living?</p><p>What hurt most was how matter-of-factly her husband had dismissed her. All he saw was the opportunity to add a banquet room to the redesigned restaurant. He was even willing to put them in a position of taking on more debt.</p><p>\u201cI wish things were different,\u201d Warren said, his eyes warm and sympathetic.</p><p>Well, maybe Olivia wasn\u2019t right about Warren\u2019s intent, after all. His sympathy seemed real, and it felt good to be with someone who understood her frustration.</p><p>Since Seth had started work at the boatyard, he seemed content for the first time since the fire. Not only that, he excelled at sales. Justine had real hope that their lives would finally settle into something resembling normalcy. Then, almost without warning, Seth was back to letting the restaurant obsess him.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d she asked, sipping her wine.</p><p>\u201cTalk to him,\u201d Warren advised.</p><p>\u201cI already have, and he isn\u2019t listening.\u201d Her eyes brimmed with tears and she quickly blinked them away.</p><p>\u201cThen do something that\u2019ll make him sit up and take notice.\u201d Warren gave a low, soft laugh. \u201cYou could always move in with me. That would get Seth\u2019s attention fast enough.\u201d</p><p>She choked on her wine. Coughing and sputtering, she said, \u201cYou\u2019re kidding!\u201d</p><p>Warren smiled and reached for her hand. \u201cI wish I was. I can\u2019t tell you how much I\u2019ve missed you, Justine. Nothing\u2019s been the same without you. We were good together, you and me. I realize what a fool I was to ever let you go.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d grown so serious it made her uneasy. Not knowing how to answer him, Justine looked away.</p><p>\u201cI can see that I\u2019ve embarrassed us both,\u201d Warren said, releasing her hand. \u201cForget I said that.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, silently reassuring him that all was forgiven. Fortunately she didn\u2019t need to say anything, because Diana arrived with their salads. She frowned at Justine in obvious disapproval.</p><p>Justine pretended not to see. Despite Warren\u2019s urging, she drank just the one glass of wine. For the rest of the leisurely meal, Warren was attentive and entertaining, working hard to distract her from her woes. After he\u2019d paid the bill, she thanked him and left to pick up Leif from his friend\u2019s house earlier than planned. She\u2019d made the babysitting arrangement that morning, hoping to talk to Seth about her ideas over lunch\u2014but that, of course, hadn\u2019t happened.</p><p>Leif was tired and cranky and fell asleep in the car on the short ride home. When she arrived at 6 Rainier Drive, Seth\u2019s car was parked out front. Actually, she was glad he was home; she\u2019d take the opportunity to talk to him.</p><p>Lifting her still-sleeping son out of his car seat, she carried him into the house.</p><p>Justine hadn\u2019t even stepped through the door when Seth loomed in front of her. \u201cExactly where did you disappear?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>She ignored him, the same way he had her, and carried her son into his room, with Penny following her. She placed Leif in his bed and covered him with a blanket. Then she quietly closed the door behind her.</p><p>Seth stood in the hallway waiting. \u201cI told you I met a friend for lunch,\u201d she explained patiently.</p><p>Seth\u2019s eyes were narrowed and accusatory. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose that friend was Warren Saget?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if it was?\u201d she said and walked into the kitchen, where she sorted the mail on the counter.</p><p>\u201cYou promised me you wouldn\u2019t see him again.\u201d</p><p>She tossed the bills into one pile and the advertisements into another. \u201cWarren\u2019s a friend, nothing more.\u201d</p><p>Seth angrily paced the kitchen floor. He stopped abruptly and seemed about to say something, then changed his mind. As quickly as it had flared, the anger was gone, replaced with what appeared to be disappointment and sadness. \u201cIn other words, you feel Warren Saget is a better friend to you than I am.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That was exactly what she\u2019d told herself earlier. She shrugged. \u201cWarren listens to me.\u201d She glanced up and met his eyes. \u201cYou obviously don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-Nine</p><p>Relaxing on a lounge chair, soaking up the June sunshine\u2014it was the perfect way to spend a Saturday afternoon. The deck had become Maryellen\u2019s favorite spot, and she savored every moment outside the house, brief as those times were.</p><p>Jon was taking photographs in the Olympic rain forest, one of his preferred locations. Those pictures had also been among his most popular. Her biggest fear was that his job with the portrait studio would kill his love of photography. This was the first Saturday he\u2019d gone out on a shoot in weeks. His parents had made it possible, although he\u2019d never admit it.</p> <p>With her knitting in her lap\u2014the baby blanket was progressing more slowly than she would\u2019ve liked\u2014Maryellen watched Katie chase a butterfly with her grandfather, who kept a close eye on her. Ellen was in the kitchen, making a fresh pitcher of lemonade.</p><p>\u201cHere you go,\u201d she said, bringing Maryellen a tall glass of lemonade, with ice and a wedge of lemon and even a fresh sprig of mint. Maryellen appreciated these appealing details, the lovely little touches her mother-in-law brought to everything she did.</p><p>\u201cOh, thanks,\u201d she said, immediately setting her knitting aside. Ellen took the chair beside hers.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind telling you what joy Katie has brought Joe and me,\u201d she said, smiling at the little girl and her husband. \u201cShe\u2019s given us a new lease on life. We\u2019d always heard how precious grandchildren were, but we had no idea it would be anything like this.\u201d</p><p>The feeling was mutual. \u201cKatie adores the two of you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe love her,\u201d Ellen said simply. \u201cFrom the moment we received the pictures you mailed us...It\u2019s hard to explain. Our world changed overnight. We had a grandchild, and now we\u2019re about to have a second one. I can\u2019t even begin to tell you what a difference Katie has made in our lives.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen hardly knew what to say. They never discussed their granddaughter\u2019s father. Really, what could they say? So far, both Joseph and Ellen had abided by Jon\u2019s wishes and had no contact with their son. As far as she knew, he hadn\u2019t said a word to either of them. Not a single word.</p><p>\u201cOh, look, Joe, look!\u201d Ellen cried out, pointing at Katie. \u201cShe wants to play hide-and-seek.\u201d</p><p>Katie had hidden behind a flowering rhododendron bush and was peeking around, just waiting to be discovered.</p><p>Everything her daughter said and did seemed to thrill Katie\u2019s grandparents. They were completely smitten with her and she flourished under their love and care and attention.</p><p>Surely Jon had noticed. Maryellen didn\u2019t think he could help seeing the transformation in their daughter. Katie had gone from being whiny and difficult to a contented three-year-old once again. It was as if their daughter had absorbed the stress and uncertainty of Maryellen\u2019s pregnancy and reflected it in her behavior. Her disposition had returned to normal soon after Jon\u2019s parents arrived.</p> <p>And yet Jon had never once commented.</p><p>\u201cJoe, Joe,\u201d Ellen shouted, playing along. \u201cWhere\u2019s Katie?\u201d</p><p>Joseph pretended he couldn\u2019t see her anywhere, which delighted Katie to the point of giggles.</p><p>The baby kicked and stretched inside her, and Maryellen rubbed her stomach. Soon. She felt she couldn\u2019t stand another minute, and yet Dr. DeGroot had told her she needed to be patient and do everything she could to forestall labor. Each single day improved the baby\u2019s chances.</p><p>When bed rest was first ordered, it had seemed an impossible situation to Maryellen. She\u2019d already miscarried one baby. Although no one had told her outright, she felt this was her last chance for a second child. Didn\u2019t Jon realize what his parents were doing for them? They\u2019d given Maryellen peace, they\u2019d taken Katie into their hearts\u2014and they\u2019d allowed Jon to do the work he needed to do. She didn\u2019t know how he could continue to ignore what should be so obvious.</p><p>She wanted to berate him for the way he behaved toward his parents. She couldn\u2019t, however. Jon had to find it in his own heart to forgive them. He persisted in holding on to his hatred, yet she didn\u2019t understand how he could.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my Katie-girl?\u201d Joseph asked, again pretending that he couldn\u2019t find the little girl. He did a good job of seeming to search high and low.</p><p>Katie loved thinking she\u2019d outsmarted her grandfather. She giggled and giggled, and Joseph acted beautifully.</p> <p>Ellen laughed, and Maryellen, too, was amused by their antics.</p><p>When she couldn\u2019t bear to remain hidden any longer, Katie raced around the bush and presented herself in true theatrical fashion. Seeking her reward, she rushed toward Joseph with her arms held wide.</p><p>Joseph caught her and, scooping her into his embrace, whirled her around and around.</p><p>Maryellen was so intent on watching them that she didn\u2019t realize Jon\u2019s vehicle had pulled into the driveway. He\u2019d parked, climbed out and was standing in front of his car before she noticed. Maryellen\u2019s breath seemed to be trapped in her lungs as Jon stared at Katie and his father.</p><p>Joseph continued to whirl her around until he saw Jon. He stopped abruptly. Katie threw her arms around Joseph\u2019s neck and gave him a kiss on the cheek. Then she saw her father and immediately wanted to be put down.</p><p>\u201cDaddy! Daddy!\u201d she cried.</p><p>Joseph lowered her to the lawn, and Katie started eagerly toward Jon.</p><p>Crouching, Jon held his arms open to his little girl. Laughing and chattering, Katie fell into his embrace. Jon glanced at Maryellen, but when he saw his stepmother sitting at her side, he turned away.</p><p>\u201cI can see it\u2019s time for us to go,\u201d Ellen said, unable to disguise her pain. She stood, reached for her empty glass and carried it into the kitchen.</p><p>Maryellen watched as Jon slowly straightened, Katie in his arms. Joseph faced his son and they looked at each other in silence.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a delightful little girl,\u201d Joseph said after a long, tense moment.</p><p>Jon didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t want us here.\u201d Joseph rubbed his hands in nervous agitation. \u201cEllen and I have done our best to respect your wishes, because we know that\u2019s the only way you\u2019re comfortable with having us near your family.\u201d</p><p>Katie squirmed, and Jon set her down. Not understanding, she turned to her grandfather and raised her arms, demanding to be picked up.</p><p>As though asking his son\u2019s permission, Joseph glanced at Jon.</p><p>Maryellen bit her lip when Jon gave a slight nod, a gesture of permission.</p><p>Joseph reached for Katie. \u201cI know you named her after your mother. She would\u2019ve been so proud. And I\u2014I\u2019m proud of you, Jon, prouder than I can say.\u201d He had to stop because tears started to run down his weathered cheeks.</p><p>Jon seemed about to say something, but didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI understand why you can\u2019t forgive me,\u201d Joseph went on. \u201cI do...and I have to say I can\u2019t blame you. What I did was despicable. I won\u2019t offer you an excuse. I...I deserve your hatred.\u201d</p><p>Ellen stepped onto the deck and stood completely still when she saw Joseph talking to his son. She brought her hand to her mouth, as if she feared she might make some sound that would destroy the fragile mood.</p><p>\u201cI want to thank you, though,\u201d Joseph said. His words, choked out with emotion, were difficult to understand. \u201cThis time with Maryellen and Katie has been a blessing I never thought I\u2019d receive.\u201d His father put Katie back down on the grass. Confused, the little girl looked from one man to the other.</p><p>Jon slid his gaze toward Maryellen. She gave him a shaky smile and picked up her knitting, although her fingers were suddenly uncooperative. The scene unfolding before her was of far more interest than the yarn and knitting needles she held.</p><p>\u201cThank you, son,\u201d Joseph said. \u201cFor letting Ellen and me come here. We\u2019ll leave you to your family now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoe.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t call him Dad, which was more than Maryellen would have expected.</p><p>Joseph paused and waited.</p><p>\u201cMaryellen and I appreciate what you\u2019ve done.\u201d His voice was gruff and didn\u2019t sound like him. He gathered Katie into his arms and headed for the house.</p><p>Nearly overwhelmed by emotion, Ellen hurried to Joseph and they hugged each other before driving away.</p><p>Jon didn\u2019t join Maryellen on the deck the way he normally did. Instead, he went immediately into his darkroom, taking Katie with him. He wanted a few minutes alone. Maryellen understood.</p><p>Those were the first words Jon had spoken to his father in fifteen years. In her heart, she knew this was a new beginning for all of them.</p><p>Thirty</p><p>It was graduation day.</p><p>When Anson had first disappeared, Allison was sure he\u2019d return before now. She realized she\u2019d set herself up for disappointment, but she couldn\u2019t stop believing that he\u2019d find a way for them to be together.</p><p>She\u2019d talked to him twice, and he hadn\u2019t even mentioned the possibility of coming back. If anything, especially now the pewter cross had been discovered, returning to clear his name seemed increasingly unlikely. Despite his claim that he\u2019d seen the arsonist, and his insistence that he hadn\u2019t set those fires during his childhood, all the evidence pointed to him.</p><p>Now, as she stood with her classmates, wearing her cap and gown, she was forced to accept that Anson wouldn\u2019t show up at the last minute the way she\u2019d dreamed.</p><p>Graduation day should be an important event, a day of triumph, yet all she felt was a sense of loss and betrayal. She wanted Anson with her so they could graduate together. Had he stayed in school, everything would\u2019ve been different. She was positive he would\u2019ve been awarded an academic scholarship. They\u2019d talked about attending the same college. They\u2019d talked about a lot of things. Every dream he\u2019d ever shared with her had gone up in flames with The Lighthouse.</p><p>Allison\u2019s closest friends had gathered in the waiting area, talking animatedly, laughing nervously, discussing plans and exchanging bits of gossip. The stadium was filled with family and friends. The chatter and all the noise made her want to clamp her hands over her ears. Soon \u201cPomp and Circumstance\u201d would begin, and Allison, along with the rest of her classmates, would file into the Tacoma Dome, where their families had assembled.</p><p>\u201cAllison.\u201d</p><p>At the sound of her name, she turned to find Shaw Wilson slipping between two other graduates. He insisted on being called Shaw\u2014she had no idea why\u2014although his real name was Phillip. He\u2019d once been a Goth friend of Anson\u2019s. Apparently he hadn\u2019t earned enough credits to graduate or he would\u2019ve been required to wear a cap and gown. As usual, he\u2019d dressed entirely in black. The June evening was mild, but he wore a full-length black coat that was long enough to drag on the floor. His face was heavily made up with black eye shadow.</p><p>Allison remembered that Shaw and Anson had hung around together at the beginning of the school year. She hadn\u2019t seen Shaw with him much after Anson began working at The Lighthouse. Shaw was the first person she\u2019d gone to after Anson\u2019s disappearance, certain the other boy would know where he was and what had happened to him. Shaw swore he didn\u2019t and she believed him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHi, Shaw,\u201d she said, doing her best to hide her misery.</p><p>Her classmate moved uncomfortably close and stared at her.</p><p>In that instant Allison knew. \u201cYou heard from him?\u201d She kept her voice low and didn\u2019t dare say Anson\u2019s name aloud.</p><p>Shaw gave the slightest nod of his head.</p> <p>\u201cIs he all right?\u201d she breathed.</p><p>He shrugged one shoulder. \u201cNot if you ask me. He says otherwise.\u201d</p><p>Allison bit her lip for fear she\u2019d cry out. \u201cHe phoned you?\u201d</p><p>Again he nodded, glaring at her as if she were a traitor. \u201cHe wanted to tell you more but he couldn\u2019t because he knows you\u2019ll tell the sheriff. I told him you can\u2019t trust a girl. At least he listened to me about that much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he need anything?\u201d After her graduation announcements had gone out, Allison had received gifts of money from family friends and relatives she\u2019d barely even met. If he needed it, Allison would send Anson every penny.</p> <p>\u201cHe says not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t phoned me.\u201d Allison knew why, too. She\u2019d lost her faith in him. Still, she waited every single day, worrying endlessly about where he was and how he was living. He didn\u2019t have any relatives who could help him, and even his mother didn\u2019t know where he\u2019d gone.</p><p>Shaw held up his hand, stopping her. \u201cDon\u2019t ask me anything, because I can\u2019t tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I help?\u201d That was all she really wanted to do. Innocent or guilty, she still loved him.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t really care what happens to him.\u201d Shaw\u2019s eyes burned into hers.</p><p>\u201cI do!\u201d She wanted to shout the words. She cared so much that she was near tears.</p> <p>Glancing around, obviously afraid people might be watching them, Shaw whispered something unintelligible in her ear.</p><p>Frowning, she looked up at him. \u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSUL,\u201d he said. \u201cThose are the first three letters of the license plate belonging to the person he saw that night.\u201d Shaw kept his head down and spoke in a voice so low she could hardly hear. \u201cHe didn\u2019t get a good look at the car, but from the back it seemed to be dark. Midsize. A sedan. Pretty common, in other words.\u201d</p><p>Hope, faith, love, all three came to her in a blinding flash. Perhaps there had been someone else there that night\u2014and that someone was responsible for the fire. Almost immediately this flicker of hope was extinguished by doubt.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t he tell me this earlier?\u201d she asked. If Anson could trust anyone, it should be her. Not Shaw. She was the one who\u2019d stood up for him, defending him to her classmates and anyone who\u2019d listen. She was the one who\u2019d believed.</p><p>He sighed loudly. \u201cAnson wanted to keep you out of this. I checked around, but I couldn\u2019t come up with anything. He said I should tell you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said gratefully. She hugged Shaw, who backed away in surprise.</p><p>Desperate for hope, she asked, \u201cIs he coming?\u201d Her voice rose excitedly. \u201cHe\u2019s here, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p> <p>Shaw\u2019s demeanor changed as he shook his head. \u201cNo way, man. He isn\u2019t stupid enough to do that, not even for you. Just remember\u2014See You Later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you later,\u201d she repeated, not understanding.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s how I remember the letters.\u201d</p><p>The music started and everyone scrambled to get into their assigned positions. Before Shaw could leave, she grabbed his arm. \u201cIs there anything else you can tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shook his head more emphatically than before.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything else you\u2019re not telling me?\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed, then he slowly nodded. \u201cHe swore me to secrecy. I can\u2019t tell you, so don\u2019t ask. Later, you\u2019re going to get something from him. When you do, make sure the sheriff knows I was the one who arranged it for Anson. Me. You understand?\u201d With that he left her, disappearing into the throng of students.</p><p>Allison didn\u2019t know what he meant and didn\u2019t have time to question him further. Already the line of graduates had begun to move and Allison, shaking from the inside out, searched frantically for her cap before joining her friends as they filed into the pavilion.</p><p>The graduation went smoothly. When her name was announced, Allison Rose Cox crossed the stage to accept her diploma. Clutching it in her hand, she descended the steps and reclaimed her chair. She sat through all the speeches and awards, but her mind wasn\u2019t on any of them. She was thinking about Anson. He\u2019d sent Shaw to her in an attempt to prove his innocence. He needed her to have faith in him and she\u2019d faltered, but she wouldn\u2019t let him down again.</p><p>After the ceremony Allison wandered through the crowd until she found her family. Her mother held a damp, crumpled tissue. \u201cIt\u2019s so hard to believe you\u2019re eighteen. An adult,\u201d Rosie Cox said, dabbing her eyes. She hugged Allison and her father did, too. Eddie shifted from foot to foot, looking bored. Her brother\u2019s turn was coming; next year he\u2019d be in high school, too.</p><p>Allison was ushered home, where her grandparents and aunts and uncles had gathered for a big family party. Everyone seemed so pleased for her and so excited. There was lots of talk about the future and the fact that she\u2019d be leaving for college in September. None of it seemed real.</p><p>As soon as she could, Allison broke away from her relatives and sought out her father. \u201cI need to talk to Sheriff Davis,\u201d she told him. She trusted her dad beyond anyone else. Her mother, too, of course, but her father was the more approachable, at least about something like this.</p><p>Zach quietly pulled her into his den. \u201cYou heard from Anson again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot directly. This has to do with the fire, though. It\u2019s important, Dad. I have some information that might help identify the arsonist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He nodded solemnly. \u201cI\u2019ll contact Sheriff Davis first thing in the morning. We\u2019ll go in and see him together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She was glad he\u2019d simply taken her word, without insisting on details. Placing her hands on his shoulders, she kissed his cheek. It\u2019d been a long time since she\u2019d done that and she wasn\u2019t sure why she did it now. Perhaps it was to show her gratitude. Not just for this but for everything.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Grad Party?\u201d her father asked. She suspected he\u2019d purposely steered the conversation away from anything too emotional.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go in a little while. Wake me in the morning, okay?\u201d Grad Party, with nearly her entire graduation class, was scheduled for later that evening. It was the last time this senior class would be together. From this point forward, they would go their separate ways.</p><p>\u201cOkay, good.\u201d Her father left the den to attend to their guests.</p><p>Allison returned to her bedroom for a moment\u2019s solitude\u2014and hoped she\u2019d made the right decision.</p><p>\u201cAllison,\u201d her mother called from out in the hallway.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in here, Mom,\u201d she said, forcing herself to smile. \u201cI needed to change my shoes,\u201d she said, offering a convenient excuse.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d Rosie handed her a single red rose in a crystal vase. \u201cThis came for you. It was delivered just now, and there\u2019s a card with it, too. Who would do something so sweet?\u201d</p><p>Allison didn\u2019t need to guess; she knew. Anson. He hadn\u2019t come himself, but he\u2019d done the next best thing.</p><p>Taking the rose and the card, she looked up at her mother, and the expression in her eyes must have conveyed the truth.</p><p>\u201cAnson?\u201d her mother whispered.</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRosie, we\u2019re out of punch,\u201d Zach announced from the hall.</p><p>Allison could have kissed him. Her mother turned around and spoke briefly to her father as she walked past.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s from Anson?\u201d her father asked.</p><p>Allison shrugged. \u201cI think so,\u201d she said again.</p><p>He hesitated for only an instant before he left her to open the card in privacy. Inside was a simple message. I will always love you. Anson.</p><p>Allison closed her eyes and, leaning against the wall, whispered back, \u201cI will always love you, too. Always, always, always.\u201d</p><p>Thirty-One</p><p>The only person Teri could talk to about this was Rachel Pendergast and rather than spill her heart out over the phone, she drove to her friend\u2019s rental. By the time she arrived at Rachel\u2019s, her eyes had flooded with tears and she was an emotional wreck, shaking from head to foot. She\u2019d almost expected to get a speeding ticket on her way here.</p><p>Rachel answered her door, and immediately grabbed Teri\u2019s arm and pulled her inside. \u201cGood grief, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Collapsing onto her friend\u2019s sofa, Teri covered her face and burst into tears. She doubled over, leaning her forehead against her knees. Rachel sat down next to her, placing one arm around Teri\u2019s shoulders, and made soft, comforting sounds.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done something really stupid,\u201d Teri bellowed out between sobs. All at once she was so furious she couldn\u2019t contain her anger.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better tell me,\u201d Rachel said in a soothing voice as she continued to rub her back.</p><p>Teri pounded her foot against the carpet. \u201cI am so stupid, I can\u2019t believe this. I just can\u2019t believe it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeri.\u201d Rachel was beginning to sound frustrated with her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s his fault,\u201d she cried. \u201cIt\u2019s all Bobby\u2019s fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d Rachel asked.</p><p>Teri held out her hand. As she\u2019d expected, Rachel gasped when she saw the huge diamond engagement ring.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in love,\u201d Teri shouted. \u201cI said I\u2019d marry him.\u201d She wept noisily. \u201cIt\u2019s never going to work. Bobby is...Bobby.\u201d She stamped her foot some more. \u201cHe loves me! At first I didn\u2019t think it was possible. He doesn\u2019t even know me, the real me, but he says it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe phones you every day, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree times a day.\u201d No matter where he was in the world, he managed to reach her, and the sad part was, Teri lived for his calls. They never lasted long, but he made her laugh without even trying. And his innocent expressions of love brought her to tears.</p><p>He claimed he didn\u2019t \u201cdo\u201d emotion and that he didn\u2019t \u201cget\u201d romance, but he was about the most romantic man she\u2019d ever met. He loved her. She didn\u2019t understand why, and yet he loved her. No man had ever cared about her the way Bobby Polgar did. He was constantly proving it. If she made even the most casual comment, some silly remark like she enjoyed pickles, then he had a case delivered to her doorstep. He showered her with gifts, half of which she refused. The only thing he\u2019d ever asked of her was to marry him. He\u2019d asked over and over, and in a moment of weakness she\u2019d said yes. But a chess genius shouldn\u2019t be married to someone like her. Bobby needed a wife who was his intellectual equal. She wasn\u2019t even close. She had to back out of this ridiculous engagement.</p><p>\u201cHe phones three times a day?\u201d Rachel repeated.</p><p>Teri sniffled. \u201cBefore I go to work in the morning, at noon and then before I go to bed.\u201d Bobby\u2019s chess-playing had never been better, and he was convinced it was all due to her. He wasn\u2019t talking about the haircuts she\u2019d given him, either. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy are you crying?\u201d Rachel asked. \u201cYou should be over the moon that Bobby loves you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause...\u201d Teri was hardly able to speak. \u201cHe wants to marry me. And it\u2019s just not possible...and...and I have to tell him that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is it so impossible?\u201d Rachel demanded. \u201cHe says you\u2019re good for him, and I know he\u2019s good for you. I\u2019ve never seen you happier. He thinks you\u2019re fabulous, and you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t really know me,\u201d Teri snapped. \u201cSomeone needs to tell him about all the loser men I\u2019ve had in my life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe wants you,\u201d Rachel argued. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t care about the past.\u201d</p><p>Teri was annoyed that her best friend would be so obtuse. \u201cBobby only thinks he loves me. Why am I the only levelheaded one in the bunch? I don\u2019t care what you say, Rachel, I\u2019m telling Bobby no.\u201d To prove her point, she yanked off the diamond ring and set it on the coffee table. Then fearing she might lose it, she grabbed it and slid it onto her finger again. That diamond probably cost more money than she\u2019d make in her whole life as a hairstylist.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m giving it back to him,\u201d Teri announced. \u201cI have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeri,\u201d Rachel said, \u201cdon\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean it. He\u2019s flying in tonight and that\u2019ll be the end of it. I\u2019m giving him the ring and then I\u2019m telling him I don\u2019t want to hear from him or see him again.\u201d She\u2019d tried to convince him once before, and it hadn\u2019t worked. This time she\u2019d make sure he understood.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous! You love this guy.\u201d</p><p>Teri shook her head adamantly. \u201cI\u2019m all wrong for Bobby.\u201d</p><p>Rachel gave an impatient sigh. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem to think so, and for what it\u2019s worth, I don\u2019t, either. You\u2019re perfect for each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you say that?\u201d Teri wailed. \u201cCan\u2019t you just see what would happen if some television reporter interviewed me? I\u2019d say something stupid that\u2019d make Bobby the laughingstock of the chess world. No, I\u2019m not going to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you walk away from him, you\u2019ll regret it for the rest of your life.\u201d</p><p>This wasn\u2019t what Teri had come to hear. She needed her conviction shored up, needed the strength to send Bobby away, once and for all. \u201cYou\u2019re no help,\u201d she cried and she stormed out the door.</p> <p>Sniffling and carrying on wasn\u2019t going to help, either, Teri told herself on the drive home. The ring kept glinting in the evening sunlight and it was all she could do not to stare at it. If she didn\u2019t watch what she was doing, she\u2019d drive off the road.</p><p>Just as she feared, the stretch limo stood in front of her apartment complex.</p><p>As soon as she\u2019d parked in her allotted space, James was there to open her car door.</p><p>Teri glared at the tall, skinny man and sniffed loudly.</p><p>\u201cAre you unwell, Miss Teri?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Bobby had sent him to collect her. This was her opportunity to make a stand. She\u2019d let him deliver the news to Bobby. \u201cI\u2019m not going.\u201d</p><p>James shook his head, his expression confused. \u201cBobby is expecting you.\u201d It was understood that no one kept Bobby Polgar waiting. Not that refusing to go would do any good, anyway. James would simply come back for her and the next time Bobby would be with him.</p><p>Still holding the steering wheel with both hands, Teri laid her forehead against it and started to cry.</p> <p>Poor James was beside himself. \u201cShall I phone for a doctor?\u201d he asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she sobbed, giving up. If she didn\u2019t go to Bobby, it would only make matters worse. He\u2019d come himself. There\u2019d be a scene. Before long, the entire apartment complex would get involved, with everyone offering opinions and taking sides. Teri could see it already. Much as she wanted to avoid a confrontation with Bobby, she didn\u2019t have a choice. \u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d she said dully.</p><p>\u201cYour suitcase?\u201d James asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have one.\u201d If that shocked him, James didn\u2019t let on. She didn\u2019t need a suitcase because she wasn\u2019t going anywhere with Bobby. She wasn\u2019t marrying Bobby Polgar, and that was final.</p><p>Reluctantly climbing out of the car, she picked up her purse and let James escort her to the gleaming black limo with its tinted windows. He opened the door and she crawled inside and began to cry all over again.</p><p>Because this ludicrous vehicle was as long as a bowling alley, she couldn\u2019t tell what James was doing, but she suspected he was on the phone the instant he peeled out of the parking lot. She could imagine what he was saying to Bobby.</p><p>\u201cGet a grip,\u201d Teri said aloud as she fought to compose herself. Wiping her face, she realized they were headed for the Bremerton airport; Bobby must have hired a private jet. This man wasn\u2019t only a chess champion, he had more money than the United States treasury. He flew all over the world. A hop between London, England, and Bremerton, Washington, was nothing to him.</p><p>As soon as James turned the car into the small airport, Teri saw the Learjet parked on the runway. Her heart began to pound and all her efforts to dry her tears were pointless. A new deluge was coming and she couldn\u2019t hold it back. By the time James had driven up to the jet and the door was opened for her, Teri was a blubbering mess all over again.</p><p>Bobby was waiting for her inside the jet, and once she appeared, he dismissed everyone from the plane. He stood in the doorway with his hands locked behind his back.</p><p>Sobbing so hard her shoulders shook, Teri climbed the steps and the second she reached the top, she jerked the huge diamond ring from her finger and gave it to Bobby.</p><p>Bobby dropped it carefully inside his pocket, then hit a button just inside the aircraft. The staircase refolded and the door slid shut.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not staying and I\u2019m not marrying you.\u201d There, she\u2019d said it. She\u2019d made her stand.</p><p>Bobby ignored that. \u201cSit.\u201d He gestured to a swivel chair covered in soft white leather. He handed Teri a tissue, which she gladly accepted. She blew her nose and thought it sounded like a trumpet call. She wasn\u2019t one of those women who could weep elegantly.</p><p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t you marry me?\u201d he asked. He looked puzzled again, as if he\u2019d done something wrong.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you see?\u201d she cried. \u201cI don\u2019t want to love you, but I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your fault,\u201d she cried.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he said. \u201cI worked hard so you\u2019d love me. You\u2019re funny and wise and beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think I\u2019m fat?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cWell...a little. It doesn\u2019t matter, though. I like you the way you are. Can we get married now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBobby,\u201d she said, recovering quickly. \u201cNo. I\u2019m sorry, no.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, then got down on one knee in front of her. \u201cI told you I\u2019m not good with emotion. I think too much, but when I\u2019m with you I don\u2019t want to think, I want to feel and I like that. That\u2019s never happened before. When I\u2019m with you, I want to do...things that don\u2019t involve chess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of things?\u201d she asked, growing suspicious.</p><p>His eyes were so honest and full of love that she couldn\u2019t have looked away for anything. He kissed her. She enjoyed Bobby\u2019s kisses because they were different from those she generally received. With other men, there was a hot urgency. But Bobby\u2019s kisses were gentle and lingering, as if he savored her. She craved his touch. His kisses were unselfish and they made her feel as if she\u2019d never been kissed before. Ironically, she was the one with the sexual experience, not Bobby.</p><p>She needed every ounce of strength she possessed to break off his kiss.</p><p>\u201cWill you marry me now?\u201d he asked. With childlike innocence, his eyes implored her.</p><p>Teri swallowed back tears and shook her head. The things he hadn\u2019t heard about her yet\u2014and there were a lot\u2014would change his mind fast enough, and sooner or later he\u2019d find it all out. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me.\u201d</p><p>Instead of arguing, he kissed the side of her neck. Teri thought she\u2019d dissolve into a puddle at his feet. The only sure way to end this was to enlighten him with the truth. \u201cI\u2019ve...there\u2019ve been lots of other men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know. From now on there will be only me.\u201d</p><p>She gripped his shoulders and pushed him away. \u201cYou know?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>She swallowed and in a small voice asked, \u201cEverything?\u201d</p><p>He nodded again.</p><p>The thought of Bobby learning about the litany of stupid, lethal relationships she\u2019d stumbled into and out of mortified her.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Her eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cCan I kiss you again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Answer the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I answer the question, can I kiss you?\u201d</p><p>She sighed and nodded. She didn\u2019t have the strength of will to refuse him.</p><p>She\u2019d meant he could kiss her after he\u2019d answered, but he didn\u2019t wait. He gave her a long, loving kiss that made her go weak inside.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said, her eyes still closed as he ended the kiss. \u201cWhat do you know about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDwight Connell.\u201d The jerk who\u2019d emptied her bank account. \u201cRay Hawkins.\u201d The guy she\u2019d had to throw out of her apartment with the sheriff\u2019s help. \u201cCarl Jackson.\u201d Her first boyfriend, now in jail. \u201cRandy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right. How did you learn all that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t hard.\u201d He paused. \u201cMy job is to play chess and yours is to cut hair. There are people whose job it is to find things out, and I asked one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She didn\u2019t have the energy to feel offended. She would\u2019ve told him all of that, anyway.</p><p>He pulled the ring out of his pocket and took her hand. The diamond glided onto her finger as if that was where it belonged.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t stop staring as Bobby pushed the same button he had earlier. The door opened and the stairs descended. Two uniformed men boarded the plane, followed by James, and walked past Teri into the cockpit, each murmuring a polite \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>Within minutes, the plane was at the end of the runway. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d she asked Bobby.</p><p>He seemed surprised by the question. \u201cLas Vegas.\u201d</p><p>Teri was speechless. How had this happened? Thirty minutes ago, she\u2019d categorically refused to see this man again. Ten minutes ago, she\u2019d still felt that way\u2014and now all of a sudden she was flying to Vegas to marry Bobby Polgar, a man she\u2019d seen a grand total of three times in her life. She hadn\u2019t even slept with him, and she was about to marry him.</p><p>\u201cDid I agree to this?\u201d she asked tentatively.</p><p>\u201cYou want to marry me and I want to marry you.\u201d Apparently that seemed an unquestionable fact to him, so he\u2019d taken the next logical step\u2014they were on their way to Vegas.</p><p>\u201cI...I didn\u2019t bring any clothes with me.\u201d</p><p>Bobby smiled. \u201cYou won\u2019t need clothes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Teri giggled, suddenly so happy she wanted to sing\u2014and she had a terrible voice. Whenever she broke into song, the dogs in the neighborhood joined in. Using a special phone Bobby handed her, she called Rachel and asked if she\u2019d cover for her the next few days and promised to keep in touch.</p><p>As she hung up the receiver, she thought of something else. \u201cI don\u2019t have any form of birth control, either.\u201d</p><p>His smile faded and an adoring look stole over his face. \u201cI\u2019d like to get you pregnant,\u201d he said softly. \u201cWith your wide hips, you should have an easy birth.\u201d</p><p>The man said the most outrageous things! \u201cFine. Then, you can go through labor.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI would if it was possible. I don\u2019t think I could stand to see you suffer.\u201d</p><p>Was it any wonder she loved him? \u201cOkay, but there\u2019s one little fact you should know. No child of mine\u2019s going to have the smarts to be a chess champion.\u201d</p><p>He accepted that without argument. \u201cGood. I want my child to live a more normal life than I have.\u201d</p><p>When they landed in Vegas nearly three hours later, they were ushered into another limo and driven down the Strip. Teri opened the sunroof and stood with her head and arms out, yelling to the crowds at the top of her lungs. \u201cI\u2019m getting married!\u201d she screeched, waving madly and flashing her diamond.</p><p>A minister was waiting for them in the penthouse suite of a posh casino hotel. The room was filled with flowers, all white. Everything was ready. All Teri had to do was sign the paperwork and show her identification.</p> <p>Then she and Bobby exchanged vows. James was the witness. Two minutes after the ceremony, they were alone. Bobby kissed her again. \u201cCan I make love to you now?\u201d he asked.</p><p>He was so sincere, so sweet. She nodded. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Bobby led her into the bedroom, looking a bit self-conscious. He turned off the light.</p><p>All at once, Teri was nervous. She was no novice to bedroom antics. As one of her loser boyfriends had said, she\u2019d been around the block more often than the mailman. While she wasn\u2019t happy about her past, she wasn\u2019t ashamed, either. But just then, she would\u2019ve given everything she had in this world to have come to her husband a virgin.</p><p>Whatever fears and regrets she had faded the instant Bobby took her in his arms.</p><p>He was gentle, as she knew he would be, and generous and tender. For her, it might as well have been the first time because that was how he made her feel. Lying in his arms, she wept silently. He kissed her tears away and explored her body with his hands and lips, between the sweetest and most exquisite of kisses.</p> <p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cDo you think I gave you a baby?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Teri considered his question. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. Maybe we should try again.\u201d</p><p>Bobby laughed and she thought she\u2019d never heard him sound this happy. That thrilled her, knowing she was capable of pleasing him.</p><p>In the wee hours, she woke to find Bobby leaning on one elbow staring down at her. With his index finger, he outlined the shape of her eyebrow. Teri smiled up at him.</p><p>\u201cCan we...again?\u201d he asked shyly.</p><p>Her smile widened, and she threw her arms around his neck, and let him know she had absolutely no objections.</p><p>They slept late, only to be awakened by James pounding on the door, announcing that Bobby was needed downstairs.</p> <p>At the noise, Bobby leaped out of bed, glanced at the clock and searched frantically for his pants. \u201cI\u2019m late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a match this morning?\u201d For modesty\u2019s sake, Teri pulled up the sheet to cover her naked breasts. She dropped it. There was no reason to be shy with Bobby. Her husband had spent plenty of time holding, touching and kissing her breasts the night before.</p><p>\u201cI have a tournament here.\u201d He jerked up his pants and scrabbled around for his socks and shoes.</p><p>\u201cThis morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. At nine.\u201d He found his shirt and buttoned it crookedly. She crawled across the bed and refastened it for him. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cMe, too. My favorite time to make love is in the morning.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened. \u201cStay here,\u201d he said, his voice husky. He cleared his throat and spoke again. \u201cI\u2019ll be back. Soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>He pointed at her and at the bed, and stammered, \u201cPlease. Order breakfast, have a...have a shower, but...don\u2019t leave this room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d she promised. \u201cIs the match televised?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He dragged in a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d she said, kneeling at the foot of the bed.</p><p>James knocked again but Bobby moved toward Teri. Wrapping her arms around her husband\u2019s neck, she kissed him in a way that guaranteed his return. \u201cThat was for luck.\u201d</p><p>Bobby\u2019s breathing went shallow, and he backed out of the room.</p><p>Teri ordered coffee, which arrived when she\u2019d finished her shower. She uncovered the television remote, and after flipping through various channels, found the station broadcasting the live chess match. The commentator was talking about Bobby, and Teri sat up in bed, sipping coffee, listening as the highlights of her husband\u2019s illustrious career were described. Husband\u2014oh, that word had a wonderful sound.</p><p>She watched as Bobby faced his opponent, a well-known Russian player, according to the commentator. Teri had never heard of him but that wasn\u2019t saying much.</p><p>Twenty moves later, the game was over. The audience was stunned. When Bobby stood up to leave, the man who\u2019d been commenting on the game tried to interview him. Shaking his head, Bobby walked directly past him. He simply marched out of the room. Five minutes later, Teri heard the door to their suite open.</p><p>Bobby already had his shirt off by the time he made it into the bedroom. He stood at the end of the bed, and his eyes glowed with warmth as he smiled at her.</p><p>She repeated what the television commentator had announced. \u201cBobby Polgar just made chess history.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hurried.\u201d</p><p>Teri held her arms open. \u201cHow long before the next game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn hour,\u201d he said, frowning.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough time,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>His smile was back.</p><p>Bobby Polgar, husband of Teri Miller Polgar, continued to make chess history for the rest of that week. Without explanation, he disappeared after each match and arrived late for several of them. Refusing all interviews, he was less social and more reclusive than he\u2019d been since entering the international chess arena. Speculation ran rampant.</p><p>Teri didn\u2019t leave the suite for five days. She had everything she could want or need at her fingertips. In fact, she had more than she\u2019d ever dreamed possible.</p><p>Thirty-Two</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to talk to you a moment,\u201d Seth said after a silent dinner on Wednesday evening. They hadn\u2019t mentioned the subject of the restaurant since last Friday, although it loomed between them. He hadn\u2019t said any more about her idea for a tearoom, and Justine hadn\u2019t brought it up. She was so bitterly disappointed in her husband that she could barely look at him. He\u2019d acted as though her ideas and suggestions meant nothing. What hurt even more was that Seth hadn\u2019t told her about his ideas, either. He\u2019d just moved forward without her.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she murmured, turning away from the sink. They\u2019d spoken very little for the past five days, exchanging only mundane remarks about Leif\u2019s needs. They still slept in the same bed, but as far from each other as possible, and they never went upstairs at the same time.</p><p>Seth had been avoiding her. He put in long hours at work. At least she assumed that was where he spent his time. For all she knew, he could\u2019ve been in meetings with a builder and broken ground. Sad to say, she wasn\u2019t privy to her husband\u2019s plans.</p><p>Drying her hands on a dish towel, she glanced into the living room and saw that Leif was putting together a puzzle, Penny curled up beside him. He\u2019d be content for a few more minutes. Pulling out a kitchen chair, she sat down while Seth poured himself a cup of coffee.</p><p>Instead of joining her at the table, he remained standing, leaning against the counter. Justine felt at a disadvantage, sitting while he stood, but didn\u2019t have the energy to get up.</p><p>\u201cI owe you an apology,\u201d Seth admitted, surprising her. \u201cI didn\u2019t take this tearoom idea of yours seriously. I should\u2019ve given it more consideration and I didn\u2019t. Instead, I went ahead with my plans to rebuild\u2014without discussing them with you first.\u201d</p><p>Justine kept her eyes lowered. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know you\u2019d made any plans, Seth. It was a shock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more of a shock than you seeing Warren behind my back,\u201d he retaliated.</p><p>She opened her mouth to defend herself and swallowed a retort. Arguing wouldn\u2019t help, and she didn\u2019t want to say anything in front of their son. Leif had heard far too many of their disagreements already.</p><p>\u201cForget I said that,\u201d Seth murmured, brushing his blond hair away from his face. Despite his words, his mouth was pinched, his expression disapproving.</p><p>\u201cAll right, I will.\u201d</p><p>Her husband exhaled, as though he had difficulty controlling his frustration. \u201cI want you to know I\u2019ve done some serious thinking about what we should do.\u201d</p><p>She dared to raise her eyes, almost afraid to hope Seth would be willing to hear her ideas.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Justine,\u201d he said, his eyes meeting hers. \u201cYou and Leif mean more to me than anything. I can\u2019t risk losing you.\u201d</p><p>Justine felt a lump form in her throat.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t destroy our marriage because I\u2019m too stubborn to let go of an idea.\u201d</p><p>Justine blinked rapidly to hold back tears. \u201cI love you, too,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cMore than Warren Saget?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she cried. \u201cA thousand times more!\u201d</p><p>Seth pulled out another chair and sat across from her. He reached for her hand. Justine struggled not to cry; she hadn\u2019t slept well in days, and she doubted Seth had, either. Lack of sleep had made her emotions more volatile than they already were.</p><p>\u201cI think the best thing to do, since we can\u2019t agree, is to sell the property. I\u2019ve contacted a real estate agent and I\u2019ve decided\u2014\u201d he hesitated \u201c\u2014if you concur, that is, we\u2019ll put the property on the market.\u201d</p><p>Justine was sure she hadn\u2019t heard him correctly. \u201cYou\u2019re willing to sell the land?\u201d That wasn\u2019t what she wanted, although at one time she\u2019d thought perhaps she did.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cWith the way property values have gone up in the last five years,\u201d he continued, \u201cplus what we\u2019ll collect from the insurance company, we should be able to walk away debt-free.\u201d</p><p>They could pay off everything they owed, but...\u201cIn other words, we won\u2019t have anything to show for all the work we put into The Lighthouse?\u201d She realized she was stating the very argument he\u2019d made earlier. She saw the discouragement in his eyes and in the tight set of his mouth. She and Seth had taken a risk when they\u2019d opened the restaurant. From the first day they\u2019d opened for business, Seth had been determined to succeed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d worked hard. So had Justine. And yet, after five long years, they had nothing. The fire had wiped them out.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d Sell the property? Even now, he didn\u2019t want to listen to her ideas. She wouldn\u2019t force them on him. \u201cCan I sleep on it?\u201d</p><p>He bowed his head. \u201cOf course.\u201d He leaned forward, not looking at her. \u201cIt\u2019s just...I\u2019ve put so much into this.\u201d</p> <p>What about me? she thought resentfully. The restaurant had been their dream, the project they\u2019d worked on together. Justine felt cast aside, unimportant. Once again, Seth had made her feel as though her contribution and her concerns were of little value.</p><p>Her reaction last Friday had been childish, and she regretted seeing Warren. Her willingness to have lunch with him that day had only encouraged him. Every day since, he\u2019d made an excuse to visit the bank. She\u2019d declined his invitations for meals and drinks, but nothing she said seemed to convince him. As he told her repeatedly, he\u2019d achieved the success he had by persisting, and her polite rejections had only made him redouble his efforts. In fact, he\u2019d sent flowers to the bank twice. His attention had become conspicuous\u2014and embarrassing.</p><p>Maybe it would be best all the way around if they did sell the property. Justine tucked a strand of hair behind her ear as she considered. \u201cYou\u2019re still enjoying sales?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Seth grinned. \u201cI appear to have a knack for it.\u201d</p><p>That was true enough; after only a few weeks, Seth was the company\u2019s top salesperson.</p> <p>\u201cBefore you make your decision, there\u2019s something you should know,\u201d Seth said. \u201cIf we list the property, there\u2019s a strong likelihood it\u2019ll sell right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be sure of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I am. From what I understand, a fast-food franchise is looking for prime property here in Cedar Cove.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d get full price and the deal can close within the month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe real estate agent told you this?\u201d Justine asked.</p> <p>Seth nodded.</p><p>\u201cWould you have any regrets?\u201d she asked, studying him.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, and he seemed sincere. \u201cNot anymore. I hate the thought of someone selling hamburgers and fries at the waterfront, where our restaurant once stood, but I\u2019d get used to it.\u201d</p><p>Seth might, but Justine wondered if she would as easily.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s sleep on it,\u201d she said again. \u201cBoth of us.\u201d</p><p>Seth put Leif to bed while Justine walked the dog. When she got back, he was still reading stories to their son. Eventually Leif fell asleep in the middle of Good Night, Moon, which both she and Seth could practically recite from memory. Justine took a long soak in the tub, perfuming the water with gardenia-scented bubble bath. Seth\u2019s favorite. Her body was glistening when she finally climbed out of the water.</p><p>Seth paused in the bathroom doorway, watching her dress for bed. He gave her a slow, lazy smile. \u201cAre you thinking what I\u2019m thinking?\u201d he said, his voice husky with suggestion.</p><p>Justine smiled. \u201cI certainly hope so.\u201d</p> <p>It was still light out when they went to bed. Seth reached for her, and Justine turned willingly into his arms. Their lovemaking was full of deep sighs and hoarse whispers.</p><p>Afterward Seth held her close. Nestled in her husband\u2019s embrace, Justine felt content for the first time in weeks.</p><p>\u201cI could get pregnant, you know.\u201d She hadn\u2019t bothered to resume her birth control pills\u2014with Seth\u2019s agreement. Not that it\u2019d mattered much recently.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>She grinned sleepily. \u201cYou\u2019d like that, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, I would. It\u2019s time.\u201d He kissed the top of her head. \u201cDo you think twins might run in the family?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flew open as she considered the idea. She was a twin. \u201cIt\u2019s a possibility, I suppose. What makes you ask?\u201d</p><p>Seth twined his fingers through her hair. \u201cIf you had two babies, you\u2019d be too busy to give Warren Saget a second\u2019s thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth,\u201d she whispered, raising her head to meet his gaze, \u201cdon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re actually jealous.\u201d</p><p>He slid his hand down her spine, and she arched her back. \u201cIn case you hadn\u2019t noticed,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m green with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no need to feel the slightest bit of jealousy. I promise you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it.\u201d</p><p>She kissed his jaw. \u201cIf you don\u2019t object, I\u2019ll give the bank my notice.\u201d</p><p>She felt his smile against her temple. \u201cNo objection here.\u201d</p><p>She loved the feel of his skin against her own. Justine smoothed her hand along his bare shoulders and over his chest. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d mind.\u201d Suddenly tired, she yawned. \u201cI like falling asleep in your arms,\u201d she murmured. With the long hours Seth had spent at The Lighthouse, there\u2019d been few opportunities for them to go to bed at the same time. And lately\u2014ever since last week\u2014they\u2019d been so angry with each other, they hadn\u2019t wanted to.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she whispered, yawning again.</p><p>\u201cSleep,\u201d Seth urged and she did, falling into the soundest, deepest rest since before the fire had laid claim to her security.</p><p>Justine woke about five in the morning, feeling energetic and alert. She tossed aside the covers, got out of bed and quickly donned her robe. Then she hurried to the kitchen and, even before starting a pot of coffee, grabbed a pen and paper. She\u2019d never been good at drawing, but her vision of a tearoom wouldn\u2019t leave her alone. She had tried to push it out of her mind, afraid that discussing it would only upset Seth. Now she was determined to make him listen, to demand that he give her idea a fair hearing.</p><p>Seth found her standing over the table, sipping coffee. He slipped his arms around her middle and hugged her from behind, pressing his cheek against her back.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awake early.\u201d Working his hands inside her robe, he cupped her breasts.</p><p>It was difficult not to get caught up in the sheer sensual nature of his caress. \u201cSeth,\u201d she breathed, even as her nipples hardened in the palms of his hands. \u201cI don\u2019t want to list the property until after you listen to me.\u201d</p><p>He seemed to stop breathing. \u201cYou\u2019re still thinking about a tearoom for women?\u201d He removed his hands and stepped away from her. \u201cJustine, we can\u2019t keep doing this. We have to make a clear decision and go on with our lives. Isn\u2019t that what you\u2019ve been saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but do you honestly want to see a fast-food joint on the waterfront overlooking the cove?\u201d In her view that would be a terrible misuse of the land.</p><p>\u201cAll right. Convince me a tearoom would be a success.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d she said, shoving the tablet toward him. Her artistic talents were limited, but she\u2019d done a fairly good job of drawing a Victorian structure with one turret and two gables.</p><p>Seth glanced down at her sketch and then at her. \u201cIt looks like a Victorian house. You want to build a house that serves tea where we once had the restaurant? I don\u2019t mean to discourage you, Justine, but I don\u2019t think the city would grant a permit for us to put a residence in a commercial zone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt only looks like a house, Seth. It\u2019s a Victorian Tea Room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Victorian Tea Room,\u201d he repeated. \u201cThat\u2019s different from a regular tearoom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe not, but that isn\u2019t the point. First, we\u2019d only be open for breakfast and lunch, and I\u2019d be home in the evenings. I thought we could add a gift store, too. We\u2019d serve high tea once a month, more often if there\u2019s a demand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Cedar Cove?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be a special place for women to meet. We could have small receptions there and an outside patio for special occasions and\u2014\u201d She stopped because she was getting ahead of herself. \u201cIt occurred to me that we were wasting all the valuable lessons we learned from The Lighthouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d he asked, studying her drawing. \u201cFor the record, I agree. But I\u2019d like to hear what you think.\u201d</p><p>Those words made her smile. \u201cWhen we were open for lunch and dinner, our working hours were much too long. I wouldn\u2019t want a liquor license, either.\u201d Because they\u2019d served evening meals, it was a necessity and where they\u2019d garnered their highest profits.</p><p>\u201cI can understand that,\u201d Seth murmured. \u201cI have to admit you\u2019ve come up with an interesting compromise....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith just the two meals, I\u2019d be home in time for dinner with you and Leif.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said, and seemed to be slowly absorbing her thoughts. \u201cHere\u2019s my next question\u2014would I be part of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you wanted to be. And only to the extent that you wanted to be. The thing is, Seth, you\u2019re good at sales. You\u2019re happy, and the money so far is great. We wouldn\u2019t need to rely solely on the earnings from the tearoom.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cIn other words, you want to do this...alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not! I\u2019d need you. Not to work in the restaurant necessarily\u2014unless you felt like it\u2014but I\u2019ll need your counsel and suggestions and input and encouragement. And your love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can give you all that,\u201d he said. \u201cGladly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can do this, Seth, I know we can.\u201d</p><p>He set aside his coffee and drew her into his arms. Justine accepted his kiss. This was the perfect solution\u2014for both of them.</p><p>Thirty-Three</p><p>Linnette didn\u2019t know where else to turn. It\u2019d been a week since she\u2019d heard from Cal. In the beginning, Cal had contacted her every few days, and then less often. Now, not at all.</p><p>Linnette understood his reasons for leaving Cedar Cove. Or, at least, she tried to. Everyone said saving wild mustangs was a worthy cause, and she knew it was. She also understood that cell phone reception in rural Wyoming was poor to nonexistent. But whenever they did manage to speak, it seemed that he ended the call as quickly as possible.</p><p>Linnette didn\u2019t need anyone to tell her something was wrong. Because she didn\u2019t know what else to do or whom to trust, she went to see Grace Harding, Cliff\u2019s wife. Grace might be as completely in the dark as Linnette, but she hoped the librarian might be able to give her some information. Linnette couldn\u2019t go on like this, not when she loved Cal so much.</p><p>She visited the library on Thursday during her lunch break. This was the first time she\u2019d actually set foot inside. The truth was, she hadn\u2019t read very much since moving to Cedar Cove\u2014mostly medical journals in order to keep current. What novels she did enjoy had been passed along by her mother. Sad as it was to admit, she\u2019d lived in Cedar Cove for more than a year and hadn\u2019t even bothered to get a library card.</p><p>The library was an inviting place to be. The floor was carpeted to absorb sound and the reading area with its overstuffed chairs and displays of books welcomed anyone stepping inside. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Linnette saw Grace right away. She stood behind the counter, chatting with a woman who was checking out a stack of books. Glancing up, she waved at Linnette.</p><p>Linnette moved toward the counter and waited until Grace had finished checking out the other woman\u2019s books.</p><p>\u201cHello, Linnette,\u201d Grace said with a friendly smile. \u201cGood to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too.\u201d Her throat started to close up and for half a second she was afraid she might cry, which would have mortified her. This just proved how despondent she was over Cal.</p> <p>\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d Grace asked.</p><p>Linnette had always liked Cliff\u2019s wife. Her mother spoke highly of Grace, too. From a brief remark her father had once dropped, Linnette was fairly sure Grace had been a client at one time.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a library card yet,\u201d she murmured, feeling more than a little ill at ease.</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s past time you did,\u201d Grace said cheerfully. She handed Linnette a clipboard. \u201cIf you\u2019ll fill out the application, I\u2019ll take care of this personally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Her hand trembled as she took it, but if Grace noticed, she didn\u2019t comment.</p> <p>\u201cActually,\u201d Linnette said, clearing her throat. She held the clipboard against her, as if it offered some form of protection. \u201cComing in for a library card is an excuse so I could talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo me?\u201d Grace asked, obviously surprised. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome to talk to me anytime you want, Linnette, library card or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout Cal?\u201d she asked in uneven tones.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Grace\u2019s face betrayed her. Apparently Cal was a subject she\u2019d rather avoid.</p><p>Linnette was afraid of exactly this.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we should talk somewhere a little more private,\u201d Grace suggested. She excused herself and conferred briefly with one of the other employees. Then she retrieved her purse. \u201cI\u2019ll take an early lunch this afternoon,\u201d she told Linnette, leading the way out of the library.</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Linnette whispered as she followed obediently. She left the clipboard on the counter.</p><p>The waterfront area was decorated by flowering baskets that hung from the light posts. Linnette had always loved strolling by the marina. She\u2019d done this with Cal many times, walking side by side, holding hands and talking. Okay, she did most of the talking, but that was what Cal preferred. Even when his speech therapy was completed, she suspected he\u2019d never be much of a conversationalist.</p><p>As if deep in thought, Grace didn\u2019t say anything as they walked. Her pace was slow.</p><p>\u201cHave you heard from Cal recently?\u201d Linnette asked when she couldn\u2019t bear the silence anymore. She matched her steps to Grace\u2019s, although she normally walked much faster.</p><p>\u201cHe phoned Cliff the other day.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t called Linnette, though. \u201cEverything\u2019s all right, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Grace nodded. She began to say something else, then apparently thought better of it.</p><p>Linnette could tell there was much more to Cal\u2019s conversation with Cliff, but whatever it was, Grace seemed reluctant to tell her.</p> <p>\u201cCal hasn\u2019t been hurt, has he?\u201d she asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s nothing like that.\u201d She walked over to the espresso stand and ordered a latte with sugar-free vanilla flavoring. After she\u2019d ordered, she turned to Linnette. \u201cWould you like anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. Is that all you\u2019re having for lunch?\u201d Linnette asked. She hadn\u2019t eaten herself and doubted she would. Getting anything past the lump in her throat would\u2019ve been impossible.</p><p>\u201cI generally have a sandwich with a latte or soup for lunch,\u201d Grace explained as she paid for her drink. \u201cI should probably be watching my weight more than I do,\u201d she grumbled. \u201cI seem to have a small problem with it, unlike others I could name, including your mother and Olivia,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cI\u2019ll eat something later.\u201d</p><p>As soon as the latte was ready, Grace and Linnette walked to the gazebo near the waterfront park. Grace took a seat on a bench that faced the water and Linnette sat down beside her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d appreciate it if you just told me what\u2019s wrong,\u201d Linnette said.</p><p>Grace sipped her latte, then sighed. \u201cYou know that Cal\u2019s in Wyoming with Vicki Newman, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe joined him there later, didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Grace nodded. \u201cVicki\u2019s a very good vet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe problem is that a lot of these mustangs have medical problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s true,\u201d Linnette whispered. She already knew what Grace was trying to tell her. Cal had fallen for Vicki. It didn\u2019t seem possible, but she felt intuitively that must be it.</p><p>Again Grace grew quiet, as if considering her words.</p><p>\u201cCal\u2019s involved with Vicki, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Linnette said bluntly.</p><p>\u201cI...didn\u2019t speak to him personally, you understand,\u201d Grace murmured. \u201cBut from what Cliff said, Cal does seem to...have feelings for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d A cold sensation came over Linnette. Cal supposedly had feelings for her, too. Apparently she was an out-of-sight, out-of-mind kind of girl.</p><p>Grace shook her head. \u201cI know Vicki, and I don\u2019t want you to think she\u2019d go after someone else\u2019s man. Because she just wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>This wasn\u2019t exactly reassuring, in light of the fact that Cal was obviously interested in her.</p><p>Grace shrugged. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t even seem to pay much attention to male-female stuff.\u201d She sipped her latte. \u201cI\u2019m not putting this well and I\u2019m not even sure how to explain Vicki.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d Linnette said from between clenched teeth. \u201cTry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, first, you and I both know that Vicki\u2019s rather...unfeminine in appearance. I don\u2019t mean to be unkind, but that\u2019s just a fact. She wears her hair skinned back and doesn\u2019t style it. I\u2019ve never seen her wear makeup or attractive clothes. We\u2019ve never heard of her having any boyfriends or even a social life. To tell you the truth, all of this comes as a shock to Cliff and me.\u201d</p><p>All of this. \u201cGo on,\u201d Linnette urged, needing to know, regardless of how much it hurt. Not knowing was worse.</p><p>\u201cThe two of them have been working closely together, day in and day out....\u201d</p><p>But Cal had said he loved her. If he felt anything for this other woman, it was a brief attraction and nothing more. As soon as he returned to Cedar Cove, everything would be all right again. Cal would come to his senses and his feelings for Linnette would reassert themselves.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s about all I can tell you, Linnette.\u201d</p><p>Linnette could think of a thousand things she\u2019d rather hear. \u201cThis is just a temporary infatuation,\u201d she said, making an effort to sound confident. Trying to rationalize what she\u2019d been told.</p><p>The librarian didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to him,\u201d Linnette insisted, urgency building inside her. \u201cIt won\u2019t be long before Cal\u2019s back, so we should get this resolved.\u201d Linnette could understand how such an infatuation, presumably mutual, might come about. Working closely together in an isolated location. Sharing a cause. Yes, she saw how all of this could happen. But once Cal was home again, he\u2019d forget his feelings for this other woman.</p><p>Cal wasn\u2019t himself. He wasn\u2019t thinking clearly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain you\u2019ll have the opportunity to talk this out with him soon,\u201d Grace murmured.</p><p>\u201cOf course I will,\u201d Linnette said.</p><p>The opportunity came much sooner than she\u2019d expected. When Linnette got back to her car, she found a voice message from Cal on her cell phone. Sitting in the library parking lot, she returned his call.</p><p>Cal didn\u2019t answer, so she left a message for him. Since she was afraid they\u2019d keep missing each other, she phoned again and told him she\u2019d be home that evening and would wait for his call there.</p><p>She didn\u2019t hear from him until nearly eight.</p><p>The waiting was agony, and she could feel one of her headaches coming on. Pressing her fingertips to her temples, she paced the carpet, oblivious to the view of the cove or the Bremerton shipyard with its massive aircraft carriers and retired submarines. Late-evening sunlight dappled her deck but she hardly noticed.</p><p>By the time Cal finally did phone, Linnette was almost convinced he hadn\u2019t received her message.</p><p>\u201cLinnette,\u201d he began.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better tell me what\u2019s going on between you and Vicki Newman,\u201d she snapped, without giving him a chance to greet her. At this stage, Linnette was long past exchanging pleasantries.</p><p>\u201cY-you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout Vicki, you mean?\u201d She didn\u2019t let him respond. \u201cI thought you\u2019d...I hoped we could speak honestly with each other. I think we owe each other that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m-m-m s-sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLinnette, stop.\u201d His voice took on a strength and conviction that startled her.</p><p>\u201cStop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI apologize.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cAll right then, you\u2019re forgiven.\u201d Perhaps she\u2019d blown everything out of proportion. Grace hadn\u2019t talked to him personally and it seemed that Cal had already regained his sanity. Relief settled over her, easing the tension between her shoulder blades. The throbbing headache that had started to pound began to subside.</p><p>\u201cI love Vicki.\u201d</p><p>Linnette gasped. She refused to believe it. Cal wasn\u2019t making any sense. \u201cYou just said you were sorry. You\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI volunteered to travel to Wyoming to rescue the mustangs because it\u2019s important to me, yes, b-but also because I needed to get away and think. I needed to get away from you.\u201d</p><p>He was telling her he\u2019d purposely left to escape her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate everything, I truly d-do.\u201d He paused as if to control his tendency to rush the words. \u201cI wanted to talk to you. I tried, but I c-couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t do well with words. I thought once I was here, I\u2019d write to you. But when I arrived, a letter seemed so...callous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this isn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d give anything not to hurt you,\u201d he said in a low voice.</p><p>It was too late for that. Pain swirled through her, cutting off her breath, undermining even her ability to stand upright. Sinking into a chair, she clutched the phone with one hand and held the other against her forehead.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing physical between Vicki and me,\u201d he said. \u201cI haven\u2019t even kissed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you believe you\u2019re in love with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d she said, thinking fast. \u201cYou need to examine everything, Cal. Your feelings and reactions. The two of you are out there alone, and it makes sense that you might be attracted to her, but that\u2019ll all change when you\u2019re back home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he stated flatly. \u201cIt won\u2019t change.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She noticed how controlled his voice was, as if he knew exactly what he planned to say and had rehearsed it any number of times.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming back to Cedar Cove.

Once he got back, he\u2019d realize what a mistake he was making.</p><p>\u201cMy feelings for Vicki aren\u2019t going to change, Linnette,\u201d he insisted. \u201cI intend to ask her to be my wife.\u201d</p> <p>Thirty-Four</p><p>Grace arrived at the Pancake Palace three minutes ahead of Olivia for their weekly splurge of pie and coffee. They\u2019d both earned it after an hour\u2019s worth of aerobic exercise. If it was just up to Grace, she\u2019d skip the workout and go straight for the pie. Olivia wouldn\u2019t hear of that, however, and was determined that Grace join her for class. Although she complained, Grace actually looked forward to exercising with her best friend. The bonus was that Wednesday evenings were also their time to catch up on each other\u2019s news.</p><p>Grace slid into the booth by the window and Goldie, the crusty, retirement-age waitress, immediately brought over a pot of decaffeinated coffee. Grace turned over the ceramic mug\u2014a ritual at the Pancake Palace.</p><p>\u201cOlivia\u2019s right behind me,\u201d she said. Reaching for Olivia\u2019s cup, she righted it.</p><p>\u201cYou girls want the usual?\u201d Goldie asked as she filled both mugs.</p> <p>Grace nodded. She\u2019d been friends with Olivia so long that she felt she could speak for her. They\u2019d met in first grade and been best friends all through school. Although they were both in their fifties, and into their second marriages, they remained as close now as when they were girls. They\u2019d come here, to this very same restaurant, for sodas after class. The Pancake Palace was a venerable Cedar Cove institution, and Goldie had been there since Grace and Olivia really were girls.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you live a little?\u201d Goldie suggested. \u201cGo for the big-time. I\u2019ve got apple pan dowdy in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>Grace nearly choked on her coffee. \u201cApple pan dowdy over coconut cream pie? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about chocolate cream pie?\u201d Goldie said next, her hand on her hip.</p><p>Grace considered that, but only briefly. \u201cNot interested, sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlueberry?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCoconut cream.\u201d</p><p>Goldie shook her head, as if bitterly disappointed. \u201cThe judge, too?\u201d</p><p>Grace nodded. Olivia and Grace remained steadfastly loyal to coconut cream\u2014and to each other.</p><p>Still shaking her head, Goldie disappeared into the kitchen.</p><p>Sipping her coffee, Grace recalled the afternoon shortly before their high-school graduation, when she\u2019d told Olivia she was pregnant. They\u2019d been sitting in a booth at the Pancake Palace then, too. This was weeks before she\u2019d had the courage to tell her teenage boyfriend. She\u2019d married Dan and shortly afterward he\u2019d joined the army and was shipped off to Vietnam. Grace sighed; she didn\u2019t know why her mind was traveling down that road.</p><p>She looked up to see Olivia walking into the restaurant, and although they\u2019d just finished a strenuous physical workout, her friend had hardly a hair out of place. She\u2019d always been like that; she was such a contrast to Jack Griffin, which made their marriage very interesting indeed. Olivia craved order and Jack...well, Jack didn\u2019t. Despite that, or maybe because of it, they succeeded as a couple.</p><p>\u201cI ordered the pie,\u201d Grace said when Olivia sat down across from her.</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d She picked up her coffee and after the first sip, exhaled with satisfaction. \u201cHow was your week?\u201d</p> <p>Grace shrugged. \u201cAll right, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guess?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d never managed to keep anything from her friend, she thought with a slight smile. \u201cCliff talked to Cal, and he\u2019s on his way back to Cedar Cove with two mustangs.\u201d</p><p>Olivia studied her carefully and after a short pause, said, \u201cThat should be good news, right?\u201d</p><p>Grace lowered her gaze. \u201cNormally it would be.\u201d With Cal away in Wyoming, Cliff had been doing Cal\u2019s work as well as his own. Grace didn\u2019t feel she was much help, but she did her best to assist her husband in Cal\u2019s absence.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>Until now, Grace had kept the romance developing between Cal and Vicki Newman to herself. She didn\u2019t believe she had the right to say anything, especially when he\u2019d been so close to Linnette McAfee. Then last Thursday, Linnette had come to her because she\u2019d sensed that something was wrong. Grace wanted to kick Cal for not being more straightforward with the girl.</p><p>\u201cGrace?\u201d Olivia said, breaking into her thoughts. \u201cYou look a million miles away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry. It\u2019s Cal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said he\u2019s on his way back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is, but he dropped a bombshell when he spoke to Cliff last night.\u201d She cupped her hands around the warm mug, letting the heat warm her palms. \u201cHe said he wants to marry Vicki Newman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe vet?\u201d Olivia\u2019s eyes grew wide. \u201cIsn\u2019t he seeing Linnette McAfee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is...was.\u201d</p><p>Olivia opened her mouth, and then abruptly closed it. All she said was a soft, \u201cOh, my.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Grace shared her friend\u2019s feelings.</p><p>\u201cDoes Linnette have any idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCliff didn\u2019t mention that part, but I assume Cal must\u2019ve at least given her a few hints. She was in the library last week and asked me point-blank if Cliff and I had heard from Cal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told her?\u201d</p><p>Grace felt dreadful about it now. She nodded. \u201cCliff told me what he suspected was happening between Cal and Vicki. I felt I had to tell her. I tried to be gentle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of this is your fault.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t her business, either, but she couldn\u2019t leave the poor girl wondering. Now she felt responsible for breaking Linnette\u2019s heart.</p><p>Olivia\u2019s hands tightened around her own coffee mug. \u201cDon\u2019t you just want to wring his neck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI certainly think Cal could\u2019ve handled the situation better. Linnette is devastated. From what Corrie said, this is her first really serious relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe poor girl,\u201d Olivia murmured sympathetically.</p><p>Grace had suspected, at his farewell dinner, that things weren\u2019t going as smoothly between Cal and Linnette as she\u2019d assumed. When she\u2019d discussed it with Cliff later, her husband had said that Cal was awfully eager to leave for Wyoming, eager to get away. Yes, he was genuinely concerned about the mustangs but it was more than that. Cliff hadn\u2019t really understood it at the time; now, however, everything seemed to add up.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know about Vicki Newman?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>Grace had taken Buttercup, her golden retriever, to see the vet when the dog had a cancer scare, and she\u2019d been impressed with Vicki\u2019s affection for animals. Sherlock, her cat, had only been in for routine checkups and shots. Vicki was often out at the ranch because of the horses, and had occasionally joined her and Cliff for a coffee. Their conversations tended to be rather stilted.</p><p>\u201cShe seems nice, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d</p><p>Grace hated to say it out loud. \u201cI find her rather...different. Don\u2019t misunderstand me. I like her, and she\u2019s certainly a skillful vet. She\u2019s always been cordial enough. It\u2019s just that she...communicates better with animals than with people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat could be said for Cal, too, couldn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Grace had to agree. \u201cEspecially before he started working with the speech therapist,\u201d she recalled. \u201cIt was the oddest thing....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhenever he was around the horses, he didn\u2019t stutter at all.\u201d She frowned. \u201cEven though his speech has improved, it\u2019s going to take a lot of effort on his part to learn communication skills. If the way he\u2019s dealt with Linnette is any indication...\u201d Grace couldn\u2019t imagine Cal ever being talkative. She suspected he\u2019d always have trouble sharing his thoughts and feelings with others.</p><p>Goldie delivered the pie and refilled their coffee mugs, then stepped away from the table.</p><p>\u201cI feel so bad for Linnette.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d Grace sliced into the pie, feeling a strange sense of sadness. \u201cI just hope Cal\u2019s made the right decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny news at your end?\u201d Grace asked, eager to hear what Olivia had been up to all week.</p><p>\u201cActually, two pieces of information,\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all ears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst,\u201d Olivia said, \u201cMom told me that Ben heard from his older son, Steven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one who lives in California?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s David. Steven lives on Saint Simons Island in Georgia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Grace remembered that now. Will Jefferson, Olivia\u2019s brother, lived in the same state; he was definitely not someone she wanted to think about.</p><p>\u201cApparently, David\u2019s in some kind of financial mess and went to his brother for a loan. Steven called to tell his father about it.\u201d</p><p>Grace leaned back. \u201cDavid\u2019s money problem surprises you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. I remember how he tried to swindle my mother out of five thousand dollars.\u201d Olivia\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cIt makes me mad every time I think about him giving my mother this ludicrous story about needing surgery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently he already declared bankruptcy a couple of years ago and now there\u2019s no easy solution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s being hounded by creditors?\u201d Grace asked. She\u2019d had some experience of that soon after Dan disappeared. It\u2019d been a nightmarish time in her life. She didn\u2019t wish those kinds of pressures on anyone, David Rhodes included. \u201cWhat I recall is that he asked you to fix his traffic ticket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I\u2019d even consider such a thing.\u201d</p><p>Grace swallowed another bite of pie. \u201cYou said you had two pieces of information.\u201d</p><p>Olivia set her fork aside and seemed to be carefully choosing her words. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything to be concerned about,\u201d she began.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Grace demanded. \u201cConcerned about what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has to do with my brother, Will,\u201d Olivia informed her.</p><p>Grace did her best to appear completely indifferent. \u201cWhat about him?\u201d He was nothing to her any longer, other than a source of profound embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cI know I probably mentioned that he and Georgia are getting divorced. They\u2019ve sold the house and the proceeds have been equally divided between them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Grace responded to the news with sadness\u2014not for Will but for his long-suffering wife. Poor Georgia. Grace could all too easily imagine what she must\u2019ve endured through the years. Closing her eyes, Grace acknowledged a sense of guilt for her part in this, and regret that she might have caused the other woman pain. She\u2019d been foolish to get involved with Will. So foolish...Grace had known he was married, which only intensified her guilt. She suspected their emotional affair wasn\u2019t his first, nor was it likely his last. Granted, she hadn\u2019t slept with him but probably would have if the relationship had continued. And according to Olivia, he\u2019d had other actual affairs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Olivia seemed to be watching her closely.</p><p>Grace gave a beleaguered sigh. \u201cThere\u2019s more, isn\u2019t there.\u201d She could feel it coming.</p><p>Olivia nodded. \u201cWill told Mom he was moving back to Cedar Cove.\u201d</p><p>Grace stared at her in horrified silence. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding! What about his job?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s retired now and seems to be at loose ends.\u201d</p><p>Grace closed her eyes. The last time Will came to town had been a disaster. This was shortly after she\u2019d broken off the relationship. He\u2019d insisted she didn\u2019t know what she was doing and that he loved her. At one point, Cliff had stepped in and, in a fit of anger and jealousy, Will had taken a swing at him. It\u2019d been a dreadful scene, a public spectacle, with Will threatening to press charges. Thankfully Olivia had witnessed the episode and made it clear that Will didn\u2019t stand a chance of having any charges stick.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried,\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>\u201cAbout me and Cliff?\u201d Grace asked and made a weak dismissive gesture with her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Olivia told her. \u201cI\u2019m concerned about Will. Mom is, too. She suggested he rethink this move. It\u2019s too drastic, especially so soon after the divorce. He needs to stay where he is. And...\u201d</p> <p>Olivia hesitated and took a deep breath. \u201cWhat bothers me more than anything is that my brother, who can be as clueless as a Keystone Cop, might assume you\u2019re still available.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill knows I\u2019m married.\u201d She remembered that Olivia had expressly told him.</p><p>\u201cHe knows, all right,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cBut a little thing like a wedding band, including the one on his finger, hasn\u2019t stopped him before. He might have the mistaken impression that it won\u2019t stop you, either.\u201d</p><p>Grace swallowed. \u201cThen I\u2019ll just have to tell him.\u201d Cliff would be happy to oblige in that regard, too; however, she had every intention of keeping the two men away from each other.</p><p>Thirty-Five</p><p>The first time Anson Butler kissed Allison Cox was last October, after a Friday-night football game. Instead of attending the Homecoming dance, they\u2019d sat in the bleachers and talked long after everyone else had left. Allison remembered that kiss as clearly as if it\u2019d just happened. She\u2019d had boyfriends before and had dated a jock while she was a junior. Clay was a really nice guy, popular and funny, but his interests were limited and they didn\u2019t have much in common. They broke up shortly after the prom.</p> <p>Anson was different. They\u2019d had a couple of classes together the year before, but she hadn\u2019t really noticed him until this year, when they sat across from each other in French. His language skills were impressive, and he seemed to catch on faster than anyone else. Allison hated the way he\u2019d downplayed his abilities and made light of his intelligence. Thinking back, she decided it was his sense of humor, unexpectedly wry, that had initially attracted her.</p><p>Sitting in the bleachers now, in the same row as she had during that first kiss, Allison closed her eyes and tried to recapture the exciting sensations she\u2019d experienced that night.</p><p>It\u2019d been really cold, she recalled, and the lights on the field were off. Clouds scudding across the sky had frequently obscured the full moon; the intermittent darkness had given them a feeling of seclusion, of privacy. Anson wore his long black coat with a knit stocking cap pulled down over his ears. He didn\u2019t wear gloves and his hands had been cold to the touch. Unlike him, Allison was bundled up head to foot in a red coat and scarf, hat, mittens and boots with wool socks.</p><p>They sat huddled together against the wind. The music spilled faintly from the gym, where everyone was dancing. He\u2019d ditched his friends and she had hers.</p><p>Anson had amused her that night, speaking in French, making up words. She\u2019d laughed at something he\u2019d said and then, for no reason, they weren\u2019t laughing anymore. Anson had leaned forward to kiss her, hesitant, as if waiting for Allison to stop him. All she could do was hope that he wouldn\u2019t stop. When their lips met, his were cold and chapped. Hers were warm and moist, and she parted them slightly, wanting him to know how glad she was to receive his kiss.</p><p>The moment was perfect. Afterward, they\u2019d stared at each other for a long time, and then Anson had said that kissing her was even better than he\u2019d expected. For her, too.</p><p>Her phone rang, jolting Allison out of those comforting memories. She snapped open her cell and saw that he was right on time. \u201cAnson?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here. You got the message from Shaw?\u201d</p> <p>She nodded. His friend had called the night before and told her Anson would phone at nine. That was all he said, then he\u2019d simply cut off the connection. \u201cHe seems to enjoy playing courier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShaw\u2019s a good friend,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cOh, Anson, I miss you so much.\u201d She tried to keep the emotion out of her voice, but she\u2019d had some bad news and was struggling to hold it in. The last thing Anson needed was her dissolving into tears over a matter that didn\u2019t involve him. There was nothing he could do.</p><p>\u201cHow was graduation?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAll right. I wish you were there. The rose was beautiful. Thank you so much for that, and the message, too.\u201d Her faith in him might have wavered, but Anson continued to love her.</p><p>\u201cYou talked to the sheriff?\u201d he asked, getting directly to the point. \u201cAbout the information Shaw gave you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I told my father and we went in to see the sheriff on Monday.\u201d This next part shouldn\u2019t come as any surprise, so she drew in a deep breath. \u201cSheriff Davis wants to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Anson snickered. \u201cSure he does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnson, you can\u2019t stay in hiding for the rest of your life!\u201d</p><p>The returning silence rang like an alarm between them.</p><p>\u201cI tried,\u201d he finally said.</p><p>\u201cYou tried?\u201d she repeated. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI phoned the sheriff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou talked to Sheriff Davis?\u201d This was wonderful news, but no one had said a word to her. \u201cI didn\u2019t know, I thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t talk to him,\u201d Anson said. \u201cI tried to talk to him. He wasn\u2019t there. I asked when he\u2019d be available and I got this runaround. No one seemed to be able to tell me.\u201d</p><p>Allison found that difficult to believe, until she remembered overhearing a conversation between her parents. \u201cOh, I can explain. His wife died recently. You must\u2019ve phoned at that time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to his wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure exactly, but Mom said she\u2019d been sick for years.\u201d It all made sense now. \u201cHe took some time off after the funeral.\u201d She was encouraged by Anson\u2019s effort. \u201cTry again, okay?\u201d</p><p>Anson seemed to consider her suggestion. \u201cMaybe I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell the people at the sheriff\u2019s office who you were\u2014did you?\u201d She felt positive he would\u2019ve received more cooperation if he\u2019d identified himself.</p><p>\u201cNo...The only person I want to talk to is the sheriff himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. I know he\u2019s back in the office. My dad mentioned it last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>All at once there didn\u2019t seem to be anything more to say. \u201cThank you for the rose,\u201d she said again. Allison had pressed it between the pages of a thick book, wanting to save it forever. The card, too.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d\u2019ve given anything to be with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Some unidentifiable noise drifted into the background, and she wondered where Anson was. \u201cI should go,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cAre you taking care of yourself?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing all right. What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust okay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She was silent for a moment. \u201cDo you know where I am, Anson?\u201d Of course he didn\u2019t. \u201cThe football field,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cIn the bleachers?\u201d</p><p>She smiled, holding the small phone close to her ear. \u201cAnd do you know why this spot is so special to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s where I kissed you the first time.\u201d</p><p>He did remember.</p><p>\u201cAll I could think about that night was kissing you. You looked so pretty. Your cheeks were rosy with the cold and you wore this bright red coat.... I figured you could go with any guy you wanted and yet you were with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she said, her throat tightening.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you keep on talking like that, I might start to cry.\u201d She tried for a humorous approach. \u201cI look terrible when I cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could kiss you right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d It was at this point that she lost her composure. \u201cOh, Anson. I can\u2019t go on like this.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t speak right away; when he did, his voice was low and harsh. \u201cYou\u2019re all I think about. That\u2019s what gets me through each day. I don\u2019t know where I\u2019d be now if it wasn\u2019t for you. Just remember that, okay? No matter what happens about this fire or anything else, just remember you\u2019re the best thing in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI realize you don\u2019t know if you can trust me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for my sake try. Please, Allison, try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something else bothering you.\u201d</p><p>She was surprised he\u2019d noticed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Anson asked.</p><p>\u201cIt has nothing to do with you or the fire or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t hold back a sob. \u201cRemember my friend Cecilia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe woman who works for your dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorked,\u201d she corrected, and swiped at the tears that ran down her cheeks. \u201cShe\u2019s moving. Her husband\u2019s in the navy, and he was transferred and she\u2019s moving to San Diego.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do the people I love best all go away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllison...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m the one who\u2019s sorry. You have enough worries\u2014you don\u2019t need to hear that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>The tears were coming in full force now. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about Cecilia,\u201d he said. He seemed to understand how badly she wanted to talk to someone about this loss.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been such a good friend to me. She\u2019s like the older sister I never had. You probably don\u2019t remember what I was like when my parents divorced, but I went through a really dark period.\u201d She sobbed again. No one else knew this next part. No one, not even Cecilia.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cShe told me what it was like when her parents split up. I didn\u2019t want to hear it and tried to block out everything she said. As much as possible I made her life miserable.</p><p>\u201cThen one afternoon I came into the break room and found her by herself and she was crying. She didn\u2019t want me to see, but I could tell she was looking at a picture. When I had the chance, I got into her purse and took out the picture.\u201d If anyone had caught her, she would\u2019ve been in serious trouble. \u201cThe photo was of her little girl who died. Later I learned she\u2019d named her baby Allison, and that was one of the reasons she felt so close to me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The tears fell unrestrained, ruining her makeup. \u201cI talk to Cecilia all the time and, oh, Anson, I don\u2019t know if I can bear losing you both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be able to keep in touch with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Cecilia said, too, and we\u2019ve promised we always will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming back to you, Allison,\u201d he promised. \u201cSomehow, I\u2019ll make it happen.\u201d</p> <p>This was the hope that got her through each day. Just as Anson\u2019s memories of her were the thing that sustained him.</p><p>Thirty-Six</p><p>Saturday, at the end of a long shift, Rachel checked her phone messages and found a slip with Nate\u2019s name on it. Instead of returning his call, she dropped it inside her apron pocket, along with the two already there. She knew what he wanted. His parents were in town. The very thought of meeting Nate\u2019s father and mother was enough to shoot chills of dread down her spine.</p><p>Thankfully Teri had given her a wonderful reason to avoid it. The fact that she\u2019d eloped with Bobby Polgar meant everyone at the shop was doing double duty. As much as her own schedule would allow, Rachel had taken over Teri\u2019s clients. Now she and Jane were the only staff left at the end of a long, frustrating Saturday.</p><p>Then, as if she\u2019d just gone out for a few minutes, Teri Miller Polgar casually sauntered in.</p> <p>The instant she saw her friend, Rachel squealed with delight. \u201cLook at you,\u201d she cried as she jogged across the salon and threw both arms around her. Teri radiated happiness. She positively glowed with it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time you got back,\u201d Jane shouted from the reception desk where she\u2019d laid out the cash. She came around and hugged Teri, too, and then grabbed her hand to examine her engagement and wedding rings. \u201cWow! Look at the size of that rock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the only thing that\u2019s big.\u201d Teri loved saying the outlandish.</p><p>\u201cTeri,\u201d Rachel chastised, slapping her friend\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of big, where is the mighty Mr. Polgar?\u201d Jane asked.</p><p>Teri shrugged. \u201cI was distracting him too much,\u201d she said, and her eyes twinkled. \u201cHe\u2019s off to Russia on some big chess tour.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look like I have a passport?\u201d Teri chided, hand on her hip. \u201cJames brought me home, but I\u2019m already miserable without my Bobby. I\u2019ll bet he feels exactly the same way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames the chauffeur?\u201d Jane asked in a mock-dignified voice with a stagy British accent.</p><p>\u201cThe very one. He\u2019s waiting for me outside.\u201d Smiling, she surveyed the salon. \u201cBelieve it or not, I missed the place. I had James bring me here even before I went home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d Rachel said, dying of curiosity. \u201cWhat\u2019s it like being married to someone famous?\u201d</p><p>Teri cocked her head to one side. \u201cI don\u2019t really see Bobby as famous, you know? He\u2019s just Bobby. He thinks about chess almost all the time, and talks about it, too.\u201d She grinned smugly. \u201cExcept when we\u2019re in bed.\u201d She giggled, then grew serious again. \u201cI\u2019m crazy about him. Me and Bobby Polgar\u2014who would\u2019ve guessed it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you coming back to work?\u201d Jane wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Teri said, as if that should be understood. \u201cI told Bobby I need to work. He can do his thing, but I have mine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou need to work?\u201d Rachel asked. Anyone who spent as much money as Bobby obviously had it.</p><p>\u201cFor my sanity, I do,\u201d Teri said. \u201cI could follow Bobby around from city to city and match to match, but I\u2019d hate it. I\u2019d hardly ever see him and I\u2019d be by myself most of the time. This way, he\u2019ll fly in to stay with me as much as possible, and I can meet him in New York once in a while. I\u2019ve got to keep an eye on my kid brother, too, you know. And my sister, Christie, needs me\u2014she\u2019s finally dumping her loser husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew York?\u201d Jane repeated enviously, back at the receptionist\u2019s desk. That seemed to be all she\u2019d heard.</p><p>\u201cBobby\u2019s got a place somewhere in Manhattan. A penthouse, I think. I haven\u2019t seen it yet, but I will soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got a penthouse in Manhattan and you\u2019ve got a tiny apartment in Cedar Cove,\u201d Jane muttered. \u201cHmm. Sounds perfect.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cYou guys are about as mismatched as any two people on earth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane,\u201d Rachel said, \u201cthey\u2019re in love, and that\u2019s what matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook who\u2019s talking.\u201d Jane glanced up from the desk where she was bundling the bills. \u201cYou keep ignoring Nate\u2019s calls. Why is that, might I ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s completely different! Nate has nothing to do with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s exactly the same. Love conquers all, remember? You\u2019re afraid to meet his parents, so you don\u2019t answer his calls. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if he just showed up one evening and took the decision out of your hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have Jolene this weekend. Nate knows that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you made sure of it, too, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Jane challenged. \u201cYou arranged it on purpose.\u201d</p><p>She had, but Rachel wasn\u2019t admitting it. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d Turning her back on Jane, she faced Teri. \u201cI want to hear all about Vegas.\u201d</p><p>Teri\u2019s eyes brightened. \u201cWe barely left the bedroom. So there I was in Vegas and I didn\u2019t play a single slot machine. Do you want to hear how Bobby kept me occupied?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we already know.\u201d Some details were best not shared.</p><p>To her astonishment, Teri hugged her hard. \u201cThank you so much,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019ve never been happier in my life. You were the one who convinced me to go with him. I\u2019m so glad I did. Bobby is wonderful.\u201d Her eyes welled with tears. \u201cI know it\u2019s hard to believe, but he needs me. And he loves me.\u201d</p><p>Rachel didn\u2019t find that hard to believe at all.</p><p>The phone rang again. Jane started for it, then paused, looking over at Rachel. \u201cYou want me to get that or should I let the answering machine pick up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe machine,\u201d she said.</p><p>Jane frowned. \u201cCoward.\u201d</p><p>It was true; Rachel was terrified of Nate\u2019s parents, especially his mother. She couldn\u2019t help it. That one brief phone conversation with Patrice Olsen had confirmed every fear Rachel had. They hadn\u2019t even met, and already his mother didn\u2019t like her. Not only that, Mrs. Olsen had driven home the fact that Rachel didn\u2019t belong in their world\u2014and Rachel wasn\u2019t so sure she wanted to be there.</p><p>\u201cRachel?\u201d Teri eyed her skeptically.</p><p>\u201cForget all that,\u201d she said, unwilling to discuss her relationship with Nate. \u201cI want to hear about you and Bobby.\u201d</p><p>Teri was eager to tell her. \u201cHe wants me to buy a house while he\u2019s away. I haven\u2019t told him yet, but I\u2019ve decided to learn about chess, too. I\u2019ve been reading up on it. Did you know chess started out as a four-handed dice game in India about fourteen hundred years ago?\u201d</p><p>Both women shook their heads.</p><p>\u201cMe, neither. Some really interesting people played chess, too. Charles Dickens played and Tolstoy and Sir Walter Scott. Humphrey Bogart was a chess player, and John Wayne. It\u2019s all really fascinating. Although,\u201d she said with a wink, \u201cI didn\u2019t do a lot of reading.\u201d</p><p>Deciding she should change the subject, Rachel asked, \u201cWhat about the lease on your apartment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he\u2019s already taken care of all that. Bobby had one of his people do it. You know what is so...so wonderful?\u201d Teri whispered. \u201cHe makes me feel like I\u2019m the only woman in the universe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeri, I\u2019m so happy for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy, too,\u201d Teri said dreamily. \u201cSo happy I can\u2019t believe it. I don\u2019t know what I ever did to deserve this....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cut his hair,\u201d Jane said, snapping a rubber band around a pile of bills. \u201cOne free haircut, and you\u2019re set for life. Go figure.\u201d</p><p>Not one to take offense, Teri giggled. \u201cYou guys want to come to my place for dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, I can\u2019t tonight,\u201d Jane said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to my in-laws.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, either,\u201d Rachel said.</p><p>\u201cYou coming back to work on Tuesday?\u201d Jane asked Teri.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Everyone\u2019ll be thrilled to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you off to?\u201d Teri asked as Rachel finished cleaning up her station for the night.</p><p>\u201cHome. Bruce is bringing Jolene over and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s avoiding you-know-who,\u201d Jane supplied unnecessarily.</p><p>Rachel reached for her purse and after a brief farewell, she and Teri left the salon. \u201cYou want to stop by my place?\u201d she invited. \u201cThe neighbors\u2019ll get a kick out of seeing the limo and James.\u201d</p><p>Teri shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t. Bobby\u2019s phoning as soon as he lands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can take his call at my house,\u201d Rachel told her.</p><p>With a silly grin, Teri said, \u201cNo, I can\u2019t. I wouldn\u2019t want Jolene listening in on that conversation.\u201d</p><p>Rachel laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>Teri walked out to the parking lot with her. James stood outside the stretch limo, awaiting her instructions.</p><p>Her friend paused and studied her. \u201cYou still care about Nate?\u201d</p><p>Rachel sighed. She was crazy about this guy, but not crazy enough to have a face to face with his mother. She supposed she\u2019d have to meet the dragon lady sometime, but she wasn\u2019t ready for that yet.</p><p>They hugged once more and each went their separate ways. Rachel had only been home a few minutes when Bruce arrived with Jolene.</p><p>\u201cWe brought dinner,\u201d he said as his daughter skipped into the house, carefully holding a pizza box.</p><p>Bruce followed, carrying the little girl\u2019s overnight bag, which he set down in the living room.</p><p>\u201cYou can go now,\u201d Jolene said, dismissing him.</p><p>Rachel laughed at the shocked look on Bruce\u2019s face. \u201cI guess you got your marching orders.\u201d</p><p>He seemed downright perplexed. \u201cDon\u2019t I get any dinner? I paid for that pizza, I\u2019ll have you know.\u201d</p><p>Jolene sent Rachel an enquiring glance. \u201cLet him stay,\u201d Rachel said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d his daughter agreed reluctantly. \u201cBut you have to leave after you eat. You can\u2019t watch the movie with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat movie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Princess Bride,\u201d Rachel whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s her favorite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard that,\u201d Jolene said. \u201cIt\u2019s your favorite, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, it\u2019s my favorite, too.\u201d</p><p>Bruce rolled his eyes. \u201cPersonally I\u2019d rather paint the living room\u2014which is exactly what I\u2019m going to be doing.\u201d</p><p>Rachel went into her small kitchen and got three plates, setting them on the table.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any red pepper flakes?\u201d Bruce asked.</p><p>\u201cTop shelf, right-hand side,\u201d she instructed, her head in the refrigerator as she dug out three cans of soda. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The doorbell chimed, and Jolene immediately shouted, \u201cI\u2019ll get it!\u201d</p><p>A sick feeling grabbed Rachel\u2019s stomach even before she turned to see who it was. Sure enough, Nate Olsen stood in the doorway. With both his parents.</p><p>Thirty-Seven</p><p>Justine had just spent two hours with a Bremerton architect, and everything had gone as well as she\u2019d hoped. Excited and happy, she phoned her mother, who suggested she visit on her way home. The courts were closed for Flag Day, and while the rest of the business world went about its normal tasks, all state and federal employees enjoyed a one-day vacation.</p> <p>Justine had always loved 16 Lighthouse Drive; seeing this house never failed to bring her a feeling of peace. The sweeping front porch was like an invitation to come in, to linger, to relax with family and friends.</p><p>When she walked up the steps, Justine could hear the vacuum cleaner running. So this was how her mother had chosen to spend her day off. Olivia was cleaning house. That was typical; her mother was a stickler for order. According to Olivia and to Charlotte, as well, that old bromide about cleanliness being next to godliness was one hundred percent true. While Justine agreed in theory, she had other priorities and struggled to keep up with her young son and her husband, her friends, the house, plus her job. Justine had handed in her notice the previous Friday; the manager hated to see her leave and had offered her an employment package that sounded tempting. Justine, however, had other plans.</p><p>After knocking, she let herself in the front door. Only it wasn\u2019t her mother doing the vacuuming, as she\u2019d assumed. Jack Griffin stood in the middle of the living room wearing headphones, one of her mother\u2019s frilly white aprons tied around his waist. His eyes grew wide with shock when he saw her.</p><p>\u201cWell, well, well,\u201d Justine said, unable to hold back an amused grin.</p><p>Jack glared at her and removed the headphones.</p> <p>\u201cNow, this is news,\u201d she murmured. \u201cShould I call for a reporter from the Chronicle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell a soul about this and you\u2019re dead meat,\u201d Jack threatened, scowling into the kitchen at Olivia.</p><p>\u201cChildren, children,\u201d her mother called, as she entered the room, drying her hands on a dish towel.</p><p>Jack held Justine\u2019s gaze. \u201cYour mother said vacuuming ranked right up there with jogging,\u201d he muttered. \u201cShe made a convincing case. It seemed an easy way to get my daily exercise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the apron?\u201d Justine asked.</p><p>Jack\u2019s gaze connected with Olivia\u2019s. \u201cThat was your mother\u2019s idea, too. Something about dusting the bookshelves...\u201d He quickly pulled off the offending apparel and tossed it on the sofa. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to say anything, are you? This is our little secret, right?\u201d</p> <p>Justine raised her hand as if swearing an oath. \u201cMy lips are sealed.\u201d</p><p>Shaking her head, Olivia walked over and hugged Justine. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to see you, sweetheart. So your appointment with the architect went well?\u201d</p><p>Justine smiled brightly. \u201cMom, I really think this idea of yours is going to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s going to work,\u201d Olivia said as if she\u2019d never doubted that for a moment. \u201cAnd it wasn\u2019t really my idea. If you recall, we came up with it together. I just happened to comment how nice it would be to have a special place to go for an elegant tea. Next thing I know, you\u2019ve got everything in motion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to eat at this tearoom, do I?\u201d Jack asked as he unplugged the vacuum and rolled it toward the hallway closet. He thrust his little finger in the air and sipped from an imaginary cup.</p><p>\u201cNot unless you wear your apron,\u201d Justine teased, saluting him with her own hooked pinkie.</p><p>Her comment earned her a dirty look from Jack. \u201cVery funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time I\u2019ll lock the front door,\u201d Olivia promised him.</p> <p>\u201cThere won\u2019t be a next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, dear.\u201d</p><p>Jack checked his watch. \u201cI\u2019d better get to the office. Some of us have to work, you know.\u201d He kissed Olivia long enough to cause her mother to blush profusely. With a flourish Jack bowed, then started for the door. Just before he left, he caught Justine\u2019s gaze and winked. She winked back.</p><p>Justine loved the changes she\u2019d seen in her mother since Olivia\u2019s marriage to Jack. For the first time since Jordan\u2019s death, she felt her mother was truly happy. Come to think of it, she was happy, too. The fire had changed everything for a while and she\u2019d faltered; so had Seth. They were finally coming out of this stupor and finding themselves again.</p><p>Justine and her mother talked over cups of tea, exchanging ideas. Olivia suggested a brand of tea she particularly enjoyed. They talked about dishes for the tearoom and Justine decided to purchase an assortment of teapots of different colors and styles. Justine wondered if her grandmother would share her recipe for coconut cake, a longtime family favorite. Olivia was sure she would. Lunches would be soups, salads and sandwiches, with a special each day. They wrote out lists of recipe ideas and discussed decor.</p><p>Justine picked Leif up from preschool at noon. While he napped, she spread out the architect\u2019s rough drawings on the kitchen table, and made notes in pencil, incorporating some of the ideas she and her mother had come up with.</p><p>By the time Leif was awake, everything had been put away. Dinner was in the oven, the salad was made, and a bottle of wine was cooling on ice while she waited for Seth\u2019s return from the boatyard. She had so much to tell him, so much to share.</p><p>The doorbell rang, surprising her. Penny, who was in their fenced yard, was barking wildly. Before Justine could stop him, Leif raced ahead of her and happily threw open the front door. He stared blankly at the man who stood there.</p><p>\u201cWarren,\u201d Justine said, trying not to frown.</p><p>\u201cHello, Justine,\u201d he said. When she didn\u2019t immediately invite him inside, he asked, \u201cWould it be all right if I came in?\u201d</p><p>Seth was due home any minute and wouldn\u2019t be pleased to find her entertaining Warren Saget. \u201cI suppose so.\u201d She hoped the hesitation in her voice let him know she was reluctant.</p><p>She unlocked the screen door and held it open. Regarding their guest suspiciously, Leif wrapped his arm around her leg, and Justine reached down to pick up her son.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d she asked. She didn\u2019t mean to be inhospitable, but she wasn\u2019t interested in his company. She wanted him to state the purpose of his visit and then leave. That was it.</p><p>Warren wore a pained look at her reaction. \u201cI stopped at the bank last Friday. You weren\u2019t there but I learned that you\u2019ve given notice. You never mentioned that you\u2019d decided to quit.\u201d</p><p>Justine felt it was none of his concern, but didn\u2019t say so. \u201cThe job was only for the interim while Seth and I figured out what we were going to do about the restaurant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve made a decision?\u201d he asked curiously.</p><p>\u201cWe have,\u201d she said, her enthusiasm bubbling to the surface. \u201cWe\u2019re going to rebuild.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen we spoke earlier, you told me you were disappointed that Seth hadn\u2019t listened to your ideas. Has he had a change of heart?\u201d</p><p>Rather than explain the complexities of her business\u2014and her marriage\u2014she just nodded. \u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, great. We\u2019ve been friends for many years, and I hope we can work together on this.\u201d</p><p>Justine was sorry she\u2019d confided in him at all, friend or no friend. She now felt disloyal to Seth for saying anything. She didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you\u2019ve decided,\u201d he pressed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have time to go into it now. But I will say I\u2019m quite excited about it.\u201d</p><p>Warren smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful, Justine.\u201d</p><p>Bored now, Leif squirmed and she set her son back on the floor. He tugged at her shirt. \u201cRead me a story, Mommy,\u201d he clamored. \u201cNow, okay? Read me Good-night, Moon.\u201d</p><p>Justine shushed him. \u201cI need to get back to my family,\u201d she said, hoping Warren would get the message and leave.</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d he muttered, edging toward the front door. \u201cYou will give me an opportunity to bid on the construction project, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure we can do that,\u201d Justine said, although she already knew Seth wouldn\u2019t want Warren on the job. For one thing, his methods and materials were sloppy; for another, he\u2019d use every opportunity to spend time with Justine.</p><p>At the door, Warren hesitated and turned back. \u201cI\u2019ve never made my feelings for you a secret,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d like to be more than your builder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWarren, please!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a long-standing friendship, Justine. I\u2019ve missed you. I hoped you\u2019d realize how much I care for you. You mean the world to me, and you always have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWarren,\u201d she said firmly, \u201cI\u2019m married. I love my husband and my son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t been happy,\u201d he insisted. \u201cI know you, Justine. I can see it in your eyes. You didn\u2019t want me to find out, but you couldn\u2019t hide it from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas it?\u201d he asked softly. \u201cOr is this just a temporary fix?\u201d</p><p>The door off the kitchen opened and Seth entered the house. Penny bounded in with him, then charged toward Warren, but skidded to a stop at one curt word from Seth.</p><p>Her husband looked slowly from Justine to the other man.</p><p>\u201cHello, sweetheart,\u201d she said, grateful to see her husband. She walked over and kissed his cheek, circling his waist with her arm. She was silently letting Warren know that her loyalty and her love belonged to her husband. Seth scooped up Leif and kissed him, then petted the dog, who sat obediently beside him.</p><p>\u201cWarren.\u201d Seth nodded stiffly.</p><p>Warren did the same. \u201cSeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWarren was just leaving,\u201d Justine said pointedly. She\u2019d explain Warren\u2019s presence as soon as he\u2019d gone.</p><p>\u201cI came to talk to Justine about the rebuilding project,\u201d Warren said affably enough. He seemed more inclined to stay and chat than to leave.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Seth said. Without even a hint of welcome, he strode to the door and held it open.</p><p>For his part, Warren didn\u2019t budge, and the two of them exchanged lethal glares.</p><p>\u201cWould you kindly stop,\u201d Justine snapped, hands on her hips. \u201cBoth of you.\u201d She stepped between them, saying, \u201cWarren, please go.\u201d</p><p>He cast her a hurt-little-boy look, his voice petulant. \u201cI think you should tell Seth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what?\u201d Seth demanded.</p><p>The dog barked but stayed in her sitting position, and Leif ran into the other room.</p><p>\u201cThere is nothing to tell.\u201d Justine felt like shouting. Warren was clearly trying to cause trouble between her and Seth, and she wasn\u2019t going to allow it.</p><p>\u201cWarren, stay away from me. I mean it. Is that plain enough for you?\u201d He\u2019d overstepped the bounds, and from this moment forward, she wanted nothing more to do with him.</p><p>Thirty-Eight</p><p>Maryellen was feeling very pregnant. The baby could be born at any time, and she\u2019d never looked forward to anything more. She was ready. Her bag was packed, the house was clean, thanks to Ellen and Joe, and her baby blanket was finished. She\u2019d bring the baby home from the hospital wrapped in the pale yellow blanket she\u2019d knit herself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was another sunny day, and Maryellen sat on the sofa, gazing out at the yard and folding a batch of towels still warm from the dryer. Jon was at home, working in his downstairs office. That was where he had his darkroom, along with his computer and printer for digital photographs. He\u2019d willingly stayed in the same vicinity as his parents, which was a sign that his attitude had changed, at least a little.</p><p>Joe and Ellen had taken Katie outside to enjoy the sunshine. Like any toddler, Katie loved exploring her world. Through the sliding glass door, Maryellen could see the three of them walking around the yard, exclaiming at the flowers and studying each blade of grass.</p><p>Katie had not only grown close to her grandparents, she talked about them tirelessly. If Jon was there, he found an excuse to change the subject. He never spoke against his parents to Katie, but he didn\u2019t discuss them with her, either.</p><p>Recently Maryellen had noticed the slightest softening toward his family. It\u2019d started the afternoon he found his father playing with Katie as she chased butterflies. That was the day they\u2019d first spoken. They\u2019d exchanged a few brief remarks since then, friendly but noncommittal.</p> <p>The phone rang and Maryellen automatically reached for it. Now that her due date was almost upon them, her mother called twice a day and visited often. Her sister, Kelly, was due in a few weeks, and they kept in frequent touch. This was probably Kelly; she usually phoned in the early afternoon.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said, expecting to hear her sister\u2019s voice. She did.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPregnant,\u201d Kelly said, giggling.</p> <p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d Only Maryellen wasn\u2019t laughing.</p><p>\u201cMy goodness, who knew nine months could take so long,\u201d Kelly complained. Unlike Maryellen, her sister had difficulty getting pregnant, but\u2014again unlike Maryellen\u2014she had no difficulty staying pregnant. \u201cNothing fits anymore and I\u2019ve got new stretch marks every day. Not that I\u2019m complaining, mind you. It\u2019s just that I\u2019d forgotten how uncomfortable pregnancy can be.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen was hard pressed not to remind her younger sister that she\u2019d spent most of her own pregnancy trapped on the sofa in their living room. The comforts she longed for were the simple, ordinary aspects of what used to be her life. She yearned for the time she could crawl into bed and cuddle with her husband. The pleasure of a real bath was a forbidden luxury. Climbing stairs was out, too, and since the baby\u2019s bedroom was on the second level, she\u2019d had to leave the decorating to her mother and Ellen. It didn\u2019t feel right not to be personally involved. She hadn\u2019t even seen it yet.</p><p>If that wasn\u2019t enough to unnerve Maryellen, she endured constant worries about the baby. She tried to be positive; nevertheless, she worried. Because of the problems associated with the pregnancy, she was deathly afraid that something might be wrong with her baby.</p><p>Early on, there\u2019d been numerous blood tests and ultrasounds, and then, as the fetus developed, fewer and fewer. The physicians assured both Maryellen and Jon that everything appeared to be normal, but their words were always followed by a statement indicating that the ultrasounds offered no guarantee.</p><p>Maryellen had already accepted that because of her age and the problems she\u2019d encountered, this pregnancy would be her last.</p> <p>As was their habit, Kelly and Maryellen talked for about ten minutes. When she turned off the phone and set it aside, she was surprised to see Ellen in the kitchen, preparing a salad for dinner.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Katie?\u201d Maryellen asked as she folded a thick yellow towel.</p><p>Ellen glanced up, lettuce in her hands. \u201cShe\u2019s still outside with Joe.\u201d</p><p>Thinking she might have missed seeing her daughter, Maryellen looked again. The yard was empty, and she saw no evidence of either her father-in-law or her daughter.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see them,\u201d she said, struggling awkwardly to her feet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019re there.\u201d Ellen washed her hands, and taking the dish towel with her, walked outside.</p><p>Maryellen stood at the open glass door, watching Ellen as she strolled casually about the yard. When Ellen didn\u2019t see her husband or granddaughter, either, she moved out of Maryellen\u2019s sight.</p><p>After a few minutes, she heard Ellen shout, calling their names. Her voice became increasingly shrill when she couldn\u2019t locate them.</p> <p>Maryellen\u2019s heart started to pound. Something was wrong. She could feel it. Every maternal instinct she possessed went on full alert. Feeling light-headed, she made her way to the stairs that led to Jon\u2019s office.</p><p>\u201cJon,\u201d she called, trying to sound calm and collected. \u201cCould you come here right away?\u201d</p><p>Her fears must have been evident in her voice, because he was up the stairs in a flash.</p><p>His eyes immediately locked with hers. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard, fearing his reaction. \u201cJoseph and Katie are missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMissing,\u201d he repeated, gripping her shoulders. \u201cWhat do you mean missing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatie was outside with Joe and Ellen. I was on the phone with Kelly. When we finished, Ellen was in the kitchen and I couldn\u2019t see Katie or your father. You know how much Katie loves the water and\u2014\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t get a chance to finish.</p><p>Jon was out the door, and she saw him dash across the yard toward the creek at the back of their property. The rushing water flowed down the embankment that led to Colvis Passage. If Katie had fallen in the swollen creek, it could carry her all the way to Puget Sound.</p><p>Standing on the deck, Maryellen pressed her hand against her forehead. Breathless, Ellen emerged from the bushes that lined the far end of the property. She looked at Maryellen and shook her head.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Jon?\u201d Maryellen shouted.</p><p>\u201cHe went down to the creek. I couldn\u2019t make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoe?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t know. He couldn\u2019t have made it to the creek, either. The banks are much too steep.\u201d</p><p>Nausea built in the back of her throat, and for a moment Maryellen was afraid she\u2019d throw up. This couldn\u2019t be happening. None of this could possibly be real, and yet the terror that overwhelmed her was real. She had a blinding headache, and feeling nausea and dizziness, she clutched the back of a patio chair.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how this could\u2019ve happened,\u201d Ellen cried, and tears filled her eyes. \u201cJoe was with her....\u201d</p><p>But it only took an instant to lose sight of Katie. The little girl loved to play hide-and-seek; all Joe had to do was turn his back for a few seconds, and Katie would see it as an opportunity to slip away.</p><p>Maryellen couldn\u2019t tell how much time passed. It felt like an eternity. Just as she was about to give way to panic, she saw movement in the bushes. Then she heard Katie\u2019s frightened wail. The relief that shot through her made her knees buckle.</p><p>Jon broke out of the thick underbrush and onto the grass, carrying Katie. The three-year-old was covered in mud from head to foot. He held her tightly in his arms.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Joseph?\u201d Ellen cried as she rushed toward him.</p><p>Maryellen couldn\u2019t hear what was being said. Ellen ran forward, and Jon handed Katie to his stepmother. As soon as he had, he quickly went back to the same path he\u2019d just left. Within seconds, he was completely invisible in the dense trees and shrubs that edged three sides of their property.</p><p>Katie continued to wail, but her deep, gulping sobs didn\u2019t signal pain so much as fear. Ellen brought Katie to Maryellen. As soon as Katie was in her arms and Maryellen had a fresh towel around her, the little girl stopped sobbing. She thrust her thumb into her mouth, then released a shuddering sigh as Maryellen sat and gently rocked her daughter and allowed her own heart to return to normal.</p><p>\u201cJoe, dear God in heaven,\u201d Ellen wept, pressing her hand over her mouth.</p><p>Maryellen raised her head to see Jon leading his father through the brush and toward the house. Joe was drenched and shivering with cold.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Ellen asked, coming toward them.</p><p>Joseph hardly seemed able to speak. Between deep breaths, he explained. \u201cKatie was playing hide-and-seek, and she went into the woods.\u201d Joe gasped for oxygen. His skin was ashen and his lips blue. \u201cShe got too close to the edge. I saw her slip and fall in, so I went after her.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen could picture the older man, racing down to the creek, stumbling over rocks and fallen trees in an effort to catch his granddaughter before she was swept away.</p><p>\u201cI slipped, too,\u201d he choked out as he leaned forward, his hands on his knees, fighting for breath.</p><p>Jon ran into the house and got a blanket to wrap around his father. Maryellen could see the barely restrained anger in his movements as he spread it over his father\u2019s back.</p><p>\u201cEllen,\u201d he said sternly, \u201cget Dad to emergency now.\u201d</p><p>His stepmother hurried into the house for her purse.</p><p>\u201cDo you need me to drive you?\u201d he asked when she returned.</p><p>Ellen seemed to be in a daze. She hesitated, and then declined, shaking her head. \u201cNo. Just take care of Katie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave them check his heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Joseph insisted. \u201cAs long as Katie\u2019s all right, then I am, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what I say,\u201d Jon barked, and Ellen nodded obediently.</p><p>Refusing to listen to any protest, Jon took his father to the car and helped him inside. Ellen was already behind the wheel and had started the engine.</p><p>Jon stepped away from the vehicle as Ellen pulled out, the wheels spitting dirt and gravel. He stood there watching until she turned onto the road.</p><p>When he joined Maryellen on the deck, Jon looked about to collapse. \u201cKatie?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s shaken up but she\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God.\u201d He closed his eyes and lowered his head.</p><p>Maryellen did thank God. They\u2019d almost lost their daughter. If Joseph hadn\u2019t gone after her when he did, Katie could have drowned\u2014probably would have drowned.</p><p>After a few deep breaths, Jon reached for the child and hugged her tight. Then he carried her upstairs for a warm bath and fresh clothes.</p><p>Maryellen changed her muddy top and when she sat down realized she was still trembling. She was shaking from the inside out, her knees literally knocking against each other.</p><p>They\u2019d come so close to losing Katie, she thought again. So close.</p><p>When Jon reappeared, she was afraid he was going to chastise her or declare that his parents were no longer welcome in his home. From the moment Joseph and Ellen had arrived, he\u2019d looked for any small infraction as an excuse to send them packing. He\u2019d never said so, but Maryellen knew.</p><p>This afternoon, Joseph had given him the perfect reason. And yet...Jon had called him \u201cDad.\u201d</p><p>Warm and dry now, Katie acted as if the events of the afternoon hadn\u2019t distressed her in the least. Maryellen felt ready for a mental ward while their daughter chattered happily away.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Maryellen asked Jon.</p><p>He grimaced and took her hand. \u201cI don\u2019t ever want to live through another afternoon like this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, neither.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I saw Joseph holding her, I didn\u2019t know what to say. I wanted to rant at him and berate him for letting Katie out of his sight.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I think he was on the verge of having a heart attack himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no...\u201d She wanted to ask Jon how that made him feel but she couldn\u2019t. His father had saved Katie\u2019s life, yet Jon couldn\u2019t acknowledge that, not explicitly, not in so many words.</p><p>An hour later, Ellen phoned to report that Joe had been seen by Dr. Timmons at the medical clinic and his heart was fine. His blood pressure was elevated but that was understandable. They were both back at the hotel and resting comfortably.</p> <p>Grace phoned, and after she\u2019d learned of the frightening episode, she and Cliff came over with dinner. Maryellen barely touched the chicken-and-rice casserole. She assumed it was because of the terror she\u2019d felt earlier, but her appetite was nonexistent.</p><p>After straightening the kitchen, her mother was getting ready to leave, and Maryellen clambered up from the sofa to hug her mother and Cliff goodbye. She suddenly noticed how much her back ached. Then and only then did she recognize what was happening.</p><p>She was in labor.</p><p>\u201cCan you stay for a while?\u201d she asked her mother.</p><p>Grace glanced at Cliff, then nodded. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJon.\u201d Smiling, she stretched out her arms to her husband. \u201cI think it would be a good idea if you took me to the hospital now.\u201d</p><p>Thirty-Nine</p><p>Charlotte spent the morning with her friends at the Senior Center. The knitting group get-together had included a lunch of sandwiches and coffee\u2014and a thoroughly enjoyable gossip fest. Although it was a lovely afternoon\u2014the official first day of summer\u2014and the house was only a few blocks from the center, she drove. She usually enjoyed the short walk, but today she needed to run errands.</p><p>Ben had decided to remain at the house, which meant he wouldn\u2019t be playing bridge with his friends while she visited with hers. It meant he wouldn\u2019t be running errands with her, either. From the moment they\u2019d started seeing each other, Ben had willingly accompanied her on such routine tasks, and Charlotte had come to rely on his companionship.</p><p>Something was bothering him. Had they been married longer, she might have known instinctively what it was. She was becoming familiar with his moods, but this latest one was new\u2014and it worried her.</p><p>As she pulled into the grocery store lot, she found a convenient parking spot, turned off the engine and sat in her car for a few minutes while she thought about this. She\u2019d hoped Ben would feel comfortable enough to share his troubles with her. Apparently he didn\u2019t. But rather than take offense, she tried to think of ways to ease his worries. Perhaps she should ask him outright why he seemed so distressed. That was what she\u2019d do, she decided.</p> <p>Olivia was walking out of the grocery just as Charlotte was going in.</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d her daughter said excitedly. \u201cMaryellen\u2019s having the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe might even have delivered already. Grace phoned yesterday evening to tell me. She and Cliff spent the night out at Jon and Maryellen\u2019s. They\u2019re watching Katie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful news.\u201d Charlotte was so pleased for Maryellen\u2014and her mother. Grace was having a good year, and she deserved it. Two grandbabies due within a few weeks of each other, a new husband and\u2014Charlotte frowned. Although Grace\u2019s happiness was unmistakable, a cloud darkened the horizon. Will was returning to Cedar Cove. Her son\u2019s sudden desire to move here concerned Charlotte. Her fear was that Will intended to meddle in Grace\u2019s relationship with Cliff.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry, I was just thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to get back to the courthouse\u2014I came to pick up something I need for dinner. It\u2019s tofu, but don\u2019t tell Jack. He eats it all the time, only I don\u2019t let him know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood for you.\u201d Grabbing a cart, Charlotte entered the store. \u201cBe sure and call me when you hear about the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Olivia promised. \u201cTalk to you later.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte exhaled heavily. Life did have its share of worries. Her first concern was Ben; she\u2019d tackle Will later. Ben had been so preoccupied lately, so distracted, and try as she might, she couldn\u2019t put her finger on what was wrong. That thought weighed on her as she hurriedly finished her tasks. She bought milk and bread, went to the cleaners, then headed home.</p><p>Yes, she\u2019d ask him. Further deliberation had confirmed her decision. Asking him was the only sensible way to handle the situation. Charlotte was a sensible woman, or she had been, until she\u2019d fallen in love with Ben Rhodes.</p><p>On the drive back to the house, Charlotte stopped at a roadside stand selling strawberries freshly picked on Vashon Island. She purchased two large flats to put up strawberry preserves. Perhaps she could tempt Ben by serving scones topped with sweetened strawberries and whipped cream for dessert this evening. He enjoyed scones, especially when they were hot from the oven. As she\u2019d always known, a clever woman had ways of getting information from a man. Her granddaughter might tell her this was an old-fashioned approach, but whatever worked...</p><p>The moment she got home, Ben came out to carry in the strawberries and the few groceries she\u2019d bought.</p><p>Charlotte followed with the dry cleaning. The prices they charged for pressing a shirt were highway robbery, but Ben insisted. He didn\u2019t want her expending time or energy at the ironing board when the cleaner was happy to do it.</p><p>Ben brought everything into the kitchen, and she saw that he hadn\u2019t eaten the lunch she\u2019d left for him. Rather than comment, she mentioned Olivia\u2019s news. \u201cMaryellen\u2019s having the baby.\u201d</p><p>Her words fell on deaf ears.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear me, Ben? Maryellen\u2019s in labor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry,\u201d he said, recovering quickly. \u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Charlotte agreed. \u201cOlivia said she\u2019d let us know as soon as Grace calls her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Shaking her head, Charlotte set the kettle on the stove to heat water for tea. Whatever was wrong had grown markedly worse in the time she\u2019d been away.</p><p>\u201cThese are a lot of strawberries,\u201d Ben commented as he picked up a large red one.</p><p>\u201cLet me wash a few of those for you to nibble on,\u201d Charlotte suggested. \u201cThey were just picked this morning and couldn\u2019t be sweeter.\u201d The vendor had told her as much.</p><p>Ben set the strawberry down and shook his head. \u201cThanks, but no.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte couldn\u2019t stand it a minute longer; she had to know. \u201cIs everything all right, Ben?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He walked over to where Harry had curled himself up on a kitchen chair and began to pet her cat. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to pry,\u201d she continued, \u201cbut you just haven\u2019t been yourself lately.\u201d</p><p>Ben pulled her close and hugged her, sighing deeply. \u201cAre you sure you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my son,\u201d he confessed.</p><p>\u201cDavid?\u201d</p><p>He sighed again. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d she said, the practical side of her nature immediately taking over. \u201cI\u2019ll pour water in the teapot and while it steeps we can start to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to burden you with this,\u201d Ben said, dismissing the offer.</p><p>\u201cNonsense! I\u2019m your wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen, please. Unless you confide in me, I won\u2019t feel comfortable sharing my worries about my own children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour children are nothing like mine\u2014especially David,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true, but we can discuss Will later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill?\u201d Ben looked up, his face a picture of astonishment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say more about him when we\u2019re finished. Please, tell me what\u2019s got you in such a state.\u201d</p><p>He seemed relieved to finally tell her, and Charlotte silently scolded herself for delaying this conversation. Instead of fretting, she should\u2019ve asked him sooner.</p><p>He waited until she\u2019d poured hot water in the teapot and assembled cups. When she sat down with him at the table, she noticed that he\u2019d placed Harry on his lap. Not so long ago, the cat had taken exception to sharing Charlotte\u2019s affections, but Ben had won him over\u2014as well as everyone else in her life. Harry purred contentedly as Ben stroked his sleek body.</p><p>\u201cYou know Steven phoned a little while ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Charlotte had talked briefly with Ben\u2019s older son. It\u2019d been a bit awkward at first, but Steven sounded like a fine young man. Unlike his brother, he wasn\u2019t a charmer and seemed to have difficulty carrying on a conversation. Fortunately Charlotte had no such problem and she\u2019d done her best to let him know how pleased she was to be part of his family.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember Steven said that David had gotten himself into a financial mess\u2014again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He declared bankruptcy a few years ago, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Ben confirmed. He looked past Charlotte, not meeting her eyes. \u201cWhat I didn\u2019t tell you has to do with yet another mess my son\u2019s gotten himself into. I\u2019m not sure of all the details. According to Steven, David was recently arrested for fraud. It was because of an insurance claim he made.\u201d</p><p>Arrested? \u201cOh, dear,\u201d she gasped.</p><p>Ben continued to pet Harry, his fingers smoothing the cat\u2019s soft fur. \u201cThen all of a sudden, he had the money to hire a high-priced attorney to represent him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of a sudden?\u201d Charlotte repeated. \u201cYou mean he came into some unexpected funds?\u201d</p><p>Ben grew very still. \u201cApparently this was shortly after the break-in and arson at The Lighthouse.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte felt a chill. \u201cAre you saying David might somehow have been involved in that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cBen, surely David would never do anything so...so vile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I want to believe my own son could do something like this?\u201d he asked. \u201cI have lived with this information for nearly a week now, and I can\u2019t ignore the possibility any longer. I checked the dates and they coincide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Ben.\u201d</p><p>All the color had drained from Ben\u2019s face. \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything earlier because...because I didn\u2019t know if I could. It\u2019s one thing to suspect my son of such an ugly, underhanded crime and another to give his name to Sheriff Davis as a suspect.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte\u2019s heart ached for her husband. What an impossible decision he had to make. Regardless of anything else, the young man was Ben\u2019s son. No father wanted to be responsible for turning his own child over to the authorities.</p><p>\u201cWhile you were at the Senior Center this morning, I paid Sheriff Davis a visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Ben.\u201d Charlotte stretched her arm across the table, wanting to clasp his hand, to offer what comfort she could. He didn\u2019t seem to notice.</p><p>\u201cSheriff Davis took down all the information and said he\u2019d look into it,\u201d Ben said stoically, gazing down at the cat. \u201cIf it does turn out that David had something to do with the fire, promise me, Charlotte, that you and your family\u2014\u201d He seemed incapable of continuing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI love you, Ben. If David is involved, you can rest assured that no one in this family will blame you in any way for your son\u2019s actions.\u201d</p><p>Her husband glanced up, and his eyes shone with appreciation. \u201cThank you,\u201d he whispered, taking her hand at last. \u201cIf David did this, I\u2019ll personally reimburse Justine and Seth for their losses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen! You can\u2019t possibly do that.\u201d Restitution for The Lighthouse wasn\u2019t his obligation\u2014and it would wipe him out financially. \u201cThey have insurance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said. \u201cI won\u2019t allow my son to hurt you, directly or indirectly.\u201d</p> <p>Charlotte thought she might weep for his pain, for his disappointment in David and his nobility in assuming an obligation he didn\u2019t need to.</p><p>But that was Ben, wasn\u2019t it? And those were the reasons she loved him.</p><p>Forty</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you do something to help my wife?\u201d Jon pleaded with the labor room nurse. The middle-aged woman with gray-streaked hair wore a name tag that identified her as Stacy Eagleton.</p><p>\u201cHoney, I\u2019m fine,\u201d Maryellen whispered, her brow damp with perspiration. Her death grip on Jon\u2019s hand said differently.</p> <p>Jon was worried. Maryellen had been in labor for nearly twenty hours, and with each passing minute, his fears mounted. Everything about this pregnancy had been difficult. He didn\u2019t know why he\u2019d assumed the labor would go smoothly when nothing else had.</p><p>The hospital staff had all assured him that his wife\u2019s labor was progressing normally. \u201cThese things take time,\u201d Stacy had repeatedly told him. If one more person uttered that trite remark, Jon thought he might not be able to control his temper. Twenty hours wasn\u2019t normal. It couldn\u2019t be. Katie had arrived with far less effort on Maryellen\u2019s part.</p><p>\u201cGive her something for the pain,\u201d he instructed the nurse.</p><p>His wife opened her eyes and lifted her head from the pillow. She\u2019d grown so pale, so weak. \u201cNo,\u201d she said in a surprisingly strong voice. \u201cIt\u2019s not good for the baby.\u201d</p><p>At this point, Jon was far more concerned about his wife.</p><p>Before he could try to convince her to accept medication, Maryellen groaned. Then, as if she couldn\u2019t bear the agony another second, she tossed her head from side to side. Jon did everything he could think of to help her, but she no longer wanted him to touch her or massage her back. The most she\u2019d let him do was count off the seconds, and that seemed so damn little.</p> <p>\u201cExcellent, excellent,\u201d Stacy encouraged Maryellen, after checking to see if dilation was complete. \u201cEverything\u2019s looking good. I\u2019ll get Dr. DeGroot for the delivery.\u201d</p><p>Kissing Maryellen\u2019s hand, Jon whispered, \u201cIt won\u2019t be long now.\u201d</p><p>His wife offered him a feeble smile. \u201cI don\u2019t think our baby is all that willing to be born.\u201d</p><p>Jon remembered the elated feeling he\u2019d experienced at Katie\u2019s birth. The miracle of bringing a new life into the world had left him awed and humbled, although much of the labor remained a blur in his memory. How oblivious he\u2019d been to the reality he faced now as he watched his wife struggle to give birth to his child.</p><p>He loved Maryellen deeply, but never more than he did just then. He laid a cool cloth across her brow and kissed her temple and whispered his love.</p><p>\u201cAre Joseph and Ellen still in the waiting room?\u201d she asked, looking up at him.</p><p>Jon nodded. Grace had called them, and as soon as his father and stepmother learned that Maryellen had gone into labor, they\u2019d rushed to the hospital. The truth was, he didn\u2019t want them there. All that prevented Jon from asking them to leave was his love for Maryellen.</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to them?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>Although he knew he was a disappointment to her, Jon shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve had the nurse give them regular updates.\u201d</p><p>Her smile faded.</p><p>Jon leaned his forehead against the edge of the mattress. He couldn\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d slept. But he knew the tiredness he felt didn\u2019t compare to what Maryellen had endured during these twenty hours.</p><p>She moaned slightly, and her grip on his hand was punishing. Trying to help her, he softly counted off the seconds. The pain lasted a full minute and a half, and her contractions came so quickly now, there was barely a moment between them. When this latest one had passed, a tear rolled from the corner of her eye.</p><p>Dr. DeGroot arrived and nodded at Jon. \u201cThis seems like a good day to be born, don\u2019t you think?\u201d he said, as he took his position at the end of the birthing bed.</p><p>Everyone suddenly seemed to get busy. Several nurses surrounded Maryellen and there was a noticeable surge of energy now that the birth was imminent.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see what we have here,\u201d the physician murmured. \u201cOkay, Maryellen, get ready to push.\u201d</p><p>Jon felt a little extraneous, as though he had no real role anymore. There was some problem, but he didn\u2019t completely understand it. Apparently the baby was facing up instead of down, which had contributed to the lengthy labor.</p><p>The pain that followed seemed to be the worst so far. Maryellen gritted her teeth and bore down with what appeared to be an excruciating effort. She half rose from the bed and groaned loudly.</p><p>\u201cGood, good,\u201d Dr. DeGroot said encouragingly.</p><p>Jon was mesmerized. He watched as the baby slipped free of Maryellen\u2019s body and into the physician\u2019s waiting hands with a lusty cry. The doctor smiled and turned to Jon. \u201cCongratulations! You have a son.\u201d</p><p>Jon smiled at Maryellen. \u201cIt\u2019s a boy,\u201d he told her unnecessarily.</p><p>\u201cIs he all right?\u201d she asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s perfect,\u201d Jon announced, although he couldn\u2019t really see anything through the tears that clouded his vision.</p><p>\u201cWelcome, little Drake,\u201d Jon whispered. This was the name Maryellen had liked best. They\u2019d discussed names a hundred different times, poring through baby-name books Grace had brought them from the library. Unreasonable as it seemed now, he\u2019d assumed the baby would be another girl; if it was, they\u2019d settled on Emily.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have a middle name,\u201d Maryellen said, reminding Jon that he\u2019d promised to choose a second name. \u201cDrake Jonathon has a nice ring to it.\u201d She smiled up at him and he leaned forward and kissed her, putting all his love, all his pride in her into that kiss.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of time to choose one,\u201d he said, entwining his fingers with hers.</p><p>When he straightened, the nurse handed Jon his son. Maryellen was right; little Drake found the world the most irritating of environments. The baby cried until Jon rocked him gently, then placed him in Maryellen\u2019s arms.</p><p>As if she needed to see for herself, she pulled back the receiving blanket and examined his fingers and toes. Drake gazed up at her and instantly settled down to sleep. Like Jon, his son had found his contentment in Maryellen\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cI believe your family\u2019s waiting for the news,\u201d Stacy Eagleton told him after finishing with Maryellen.</p><p>\u201cWill you tell them?\u201d Maryellen asked, her eyes imploring.</p><p>It was decision time for Jon. A part of him wanted to ignore the fact that his father and stepmother were even at the hospital. He\u2019d vowed not to let them back in his life. He\u2019d fought to maintain this promise to himself. He didn\u2019t want to care about his father. The man had turned his back on Jon when he\u2019d counted on his family to come forward with the truth. He\u2019d lied. Even knowing his oldest son was innocent, Joseph had sent him to prison.</p><p>\u201cJon?\u201d Maryellen whispered.</p><p>Her soft voice drew him from his reverie. As he stared down at his sleeping son, Jon\u2019s heart filled with such overwhelming love that he thought it might burst wide open. For the first time, he understood his father\u2019s dilemma.</p><p>Jon had two children now, too. Katie and Drake, and he loved them equally. If he had to choose to send one to prison over the other, which would it be? He didn\u2019t ever want to find himself in such a horrible position\u2014sacrificing one child to protect the other. Granted, Joseph had no legal or moral right to make such a choice, to play God in this way, but Jon could understand it now, at least a little. Yes, Jim had been guilty, but he was a weak and vulnerable man, easily broken. He\u2019d lied about Jon\u2019s culpability, and Joseph had backed him up. Joseph had chosen to sacrifice Jon because he was stronger than his brother. Prison would have destroyed Jim. In the end, of course, Jim had destroyed himself, despite Joseph\u2019s attempts to save him with rehab and counseling and unstinting support.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell them,\u201d he said.</p><p>Maryellen clasped his hand. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been here nearly twenty hours, too,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>As he walked into the waiting area, Ellen and Joseph immediately stood. Two other people who sat at the far end glanced over, then returned to their conversation. His parents looked at him, their eyes wide with expectation. They were both tired and disheveled, especially his father. Only the day before, Joseph had frantically stumbled through knee-deep running water in a desperate attempt to save Katie. His father, with a weak heart, had nearly suffered a heart attack while rescuing his granddaughter.</p><p>If he lived another hundred years, Jon would never forget the panic in his father\u2019s eyes when Jon found him sitting on a fallen log, holding a sobbing Katie in his arms. He\u2019d been panting with relief and physical exertion and was deathly pale. Seeing the embankment his father had clambered down in his struggle to reach Katie, Jon thought it was a miracle the old man hadn\u2019t been swept away himself.</p><p>\u201cWe have a son,\u201d Jon told them.</p><p>Ellen brought her hands to her mouth and tears streamed from her eyes.</p><p>\u201cA boy,\u201d his father repeated, grinning proudly.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaryellen\u2019s okay?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s exhausted. I\u2019m married to an incredible woman, you know that?\u201d</p><p>Joseph grinned again and nodded in obvious agreement.</p><p>\u201cHow much does he weigh?\u201d his stepmother asked.</p><p>\u201cSix pounds, thirteen ounces,\u201d Jon said. \u201cHe measured twenty-one inches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to be lanky like his father,\u201d Joseph commented.</p><p>\u201cAnd grandfather,\u201d Ellen added, looping her arm around her husband\u2019s waist. She leaned her head against his arm. \u201cHave you and Maryellen chosen a name?\u201d</p><p>Jon looked at the two of them. \u201cWe decided on Drake,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDrake. Drake Bowman.\u201d His father seemed to test the name, then nodded approvingly. \u201cI like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrake Joseph Bowman,\u201d Jon said, his gaze connecting with his father\u2019s.</p><p>Joseph stared at him, and then his eyes filled with tears that ran down his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cOh, Jon.\u201d Ellen was sobbing now. She held out her arms to him and after the briefest hesitation, Jon hugged his stepmother and then his father.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t known he was capable of forgiveness until that moment. What he\u2019d discovered was that when a man found love, the kind of love and contentment he\u2019d discovered with Maryellen, there wasn\u2019t room in his life for hatred. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Forty-One</p><p>Teri stirred the boiling macaroni and tasted it to see if it was done. She sometimes overcooked it, and that would ruin everything. This dinner was special\u2014she was cooking for Bobby.</p><p>Although she\u2019d been married for more than two weeks, it was the first meal she\u2019d put together for her husband. Bobby was flying in from someplace in Russia following an important match. She\u2019d had no idea the demands on his time would be this constant.</p><p>Although he was faithful about phoning each and every day, and often more than that, Bobby hadn\u2019t contacted her when he\u2019d finished this match. As far as Teri could figure, Bobby was on a plane. He\u2019d caught a flight immediately after the competition and was landing in Seattle at five. James was with him and would drive him from Sea-Tac to Cedar Cove\u2014to their home. Yes, they had a real home now, at 74 Seaside Avenue.</p> <p>Within days of her return from Las Vegas, Teri had purchased the house. Bobby insisted she move out of her apartment and into a place big enough for both of them. He\u2019d written the check, and she\u2019d moved in so quickly that her head was still spinning. She\u2019d learned that when Bobby Polgar wanted something done, it got done.</p><p>He\u2019d given her a credit card, which she\u2019d used to buy new furniture from a high-class Seattle shop, including a leather sofa, the price of which shocked her, and a solid-wood dining suite. And then there was the bed....</p><p>Eager to show her husband the house and cook for him, Teri had decided to make one of her favorite meals. The macaroni-and-cheese dish was a hit whenever she brought it to the Christmas potluck at work. She had a couple of variations on it, too. Sometimes she added cooked taco meat, which was just hamburger and taco seasonings. Occasionally she threw in some chopped tomatoes.</p><p>Teri wanted Bobby to like her cooking. When he\u2019d taken her out for dinner, or\u2014more frequently\u2014ordered room service, they\u2019d always had fancy food, lobster and such. She thought he\u2019d enjoy some more basic fare. Her kind of food.</p><p>It seemed strange but they\u2019d been apart longer than they\u2019d been married. She needed her husband, missed being with him and, yes, sleeping with him. Although the truth was, neither of them seemed too interested in sleep. She smiled, recalling how much Bobby seemed to enjoy the marriage bed. Well, it\u2019d mostly been hotel beds, but that wasn\u2019t the point.</p> <p>Peering out the window, she saw the stretch limo pull up in front of the house. Too excited to wait a second longer, Teri dashed out the door. Bobby hadn\u2019t even taken two steps toward her when she hurled herself into his arms. The impact nearly knocked him off his feet. If not for the fact that the vehicle was directly behind him, Bobby would\u2019ve keeled straight over.</p><p>Teri spread eager kisses across his face, setting his glasses askew. She quickly realized he wasn\u2019t nearly as enthusiastic as he normally was.</p><p>\u201cBobby?\u201d she asked, leaning back to get a good look at him. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer right away. In fact, it was James who explained in hushed tones. \u201cYou didn\u2019t hear?\u201d he asked. \u201cBobby lost.\u201d</p><p>Well, those things happened. He couldn\u2019t possibly win every time. You win some and you lose some; that was her philosophy of life. In Bobby\u2019s case, he won more often than he lost because he was so darned good at what he did.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t like to lose, Miss Teri,\u201d James explained further.</p> <p>\u201cNo one enjoys losing,\u201d she said calmly. \u201cDoes this mean our entire visit is ruined?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t lose often,\u201d James continued.</p><p>Bobby didn\u2019t even seem to be listening. James dragged his suitcase into the house and placed it just inside the living room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid he\u2019s taken the defeat hard,\u201d James said in a low voice as he walked past her on his return to the limo. \u201cHe needs a bit of TLC, and he\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ll be back to pick him up in two days.\u201d</p><p>Pulling her husband gently by the hand, Teri led him into the house. \u201cLet me give you a tour,\u201d she said.</p><p>He seemed to be in some kind of trance. \u201cBobby, are you listening?\u201d She waved her fingers in front of his face with no result. Instead he walked over to the chessboard she\u2019d set up on a small oak table and sat down. She\u2019d studied a diagram to position the pieces correctly. Without a word, he started moving them around.</p><p>Teri could see it would do no good to interrupt him with a little thing like...life. His concentration was so complete that he didn\u2019t seem to be aware of where he was or that she was with him. Rather than pouting or making a fuss, Teri dished up a bowl of her specialty macaroni and cheese, squirted on some ketchup and sat cross-legged on the carpet beside him to wait.</p><p>An hour later, Bobby glanced up, apparently shocked to find her there. \u201cTeri?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHello, Bobby. Welcome home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lost.\u201d</p><p>She sat down on the sofa next to him and brushed his hair aside. \u201cI heard,\u201d she said tenderly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like to lose.\u201d</p><p>No kidding. \u201cDid you figure out what went wrong?\u201d she asked, looking over the chessboard and the pieces he had scattered about.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d</p><p>Her question resulted in a furrowed brow, as if he wasn\u2019t sure how to answer.</p><p>\u201cNever mind, I\u2019ll get you a dish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could wait,\u201d he said, and his eyes held hers for the longest moment.</p><p>Teri might not have been married long but she knew that look. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019d like to see the rest of the house,\u201d she suggested. \u201cShall we begin with the master bedroom?\u201d</p><p>For the first time since he\u2019d arrived, Bobby smiled. He trotted down the hallway behind her and into the bedroom. Then he shut the door.</p><p>An hour later, Teri lay next to him in bed, sighing with contentment. Bobby held her close. \u201cLosing doesn\u2019t seem so bad when I hold you,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry now,\u201d he said and, as if to prove his point, his stomach growled.</p><p>\u201cYou should be,\u201d she said, kissing his jaw. \u201cThat was quite a workout I gave you.\u201d</p><p>Bobby smiled again, and Teri wondered how many people in this world had actually seen her husband do that. Not many, she suspected. She climbed out of bed and got her robe, slipping her arms into the sleeves.</p><p>\u201cDo you like the house?\u201d she asked, tying her sash. She\u2019d felt a bit anxious about that, since she\u2019d made the decision without Bobby.</p><p>He sat up and grinned. \u201cVery much. Especially the bedroom.\u201d</p><p>Teri swatted his shoulder playfully. \u201cCome on, husband of mine, and I\u2019ll serve you my specialty.\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head to one side, and gazed up at her, his expression intense.</p><p>\u201cBobby?\u201d She wasn\u2019t sure what he was thinking when he stared at her like that.</p><p>A deep frown wrinkled his brow and the perplexed look gradually turned into one of pleasure\u2014and wonderment. \u201cI love you,\u201d he said simply. \u201cI really love you.\u201d</p><p>She leaned over and kissed him softly on the lips. \u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>Their time together was brief, too brief to suit Teri. They had three nights and two full days. Every evening she cooked for him. He enjoyed her macaroni and cheese, and her chili pie, another dish she\u2019d invented, and her broccoli quiche, which she\u2019d made using a recipe she\u2019d cut out from the Chronicle. They listened to music and she taught him how to play Yahtzee and strip poker. He preferred the poker.</p><p>He liked the fact that he didn\u2019t yet know anyone in Cedar Cove. She\u2019d taken Saturday off, so they had the whole weekend, during which they saw only each other\u2014no friends or neighbors. Teri didn\u2019t even answer her phone.</p><p>Except for the five days they\u2019d spent on their honeymoon, they\u2019d had almost no time together. Those days in Vegas weren\u2019t a true indication of what life with Bobby would be like. Now that he was home, she\u2019d been surprised by how little he actually slept. He\u2019d told her once that he spent a lot of time thinking, and that had been no exaggeration. He required four hours or less of sleep a night. Often she found him sitting in the living room in front of the chessboard, studying it intently, working out moves in his mind.</p><p>Sometimes he seemed to forget she was with him. Terri didn\u2019t take offense at his lack of attention. Because when he did remember, he made her feel more cherished and loved than she\u2019d ever felt in her life.</p><p>When he said he loved her, he meant it. Loving someone seemed to be a new experience for Bobby, and it was important to him that she know how strong his feelings were. Every day they were together he bought her gifts, ordering them by phone or Internet, and no doubt paying a premium for quick delivery. These weren\u2019t minor gifts, either. The first day it was a diamond tennis bracelet and a tennis racket to go with it. Teri had never played tennis in her life. Bobby, however, believed the two were supposed to go together and she wasn\u2019t about to disillusion him. The following day it was a wall-mounted plasma-screen television with satellite hookup.</p><p>When James arrived, Teri had to swallow the words to ask her husband to stay a few extra days.</p><p>Bobby held her and then kissed her. She kissed him back. \u201cWhen will I see you again?\u201d she asked, thinking any more than a few hours would be too long.</p><p>He explained his travel schedule, the upcoming matches. His answer was lengthy, technical and confusing. She looked to James for a translation.</p><p>\u201cA week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can last a week,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Bobby smiled and hugged her a final time.</p><p>\u201cTake care of him,\u201d she told James, her hand lingering on her husband\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d He opened the car door for Bobby, who reluctantly climbed in the backseat.</p><p>Folding her arms, Teri stepped away from the curb.</p><p>\u201cYou did a great job,\u201d the chauffeur said under his breath as he walked around the limo. \u201cI\u2019ve only known Bobby to lose one other match in all the years I\u2019ve worked for him. Afterward, he sank into a depression that lasted for months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be all right now,\u201d she assured the driver.</p><p>James touched the rim of his cap. \u201cYou\u2019re good for him, Miss Teri.\u201d</p><p>What she didn\u2019t tell James was that Bobby was good for her, too.</p><p>Forty-Two</p><p>Linnette had waited for this moment ever since she\u2019d heard Cal was back from Wyoming. After a week, he\u2019d phoned and asked if they could meet.</p><p>She had restrained herself from calling him, and the fact that he\u2019d taken so long to get in touch only compounded the pain. Hoping to put them both at ease, she\u2019d suggested the waterfront park. It was neutral territory, and in the early afternoon, there were few occupants besides the seagulls. On Thursday evenings during the summer, the park held Concerts on the Cove, with free entertainment ranging from rock-and-roll groups to folk singers and swing bands. Linnette hadn\u2019t yet attended a single one, although she knew her parents enjoyed the outings. It didn\u2019t strike her as something that would appeal to her father, but he went, primarily to please her mother. It was their once-a-week summer date. If it wasn\u2019t so ironic, it would be laughable. Her married parents dated more often than she did. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As Linnette sat in the bleachers waiting for Cal, she wondered how she\u2019d react when he told her face-to-face that he no longer wanted to be part of her life. For reasons she couldn\u2019t really explain, she needed him to tell her in person. Ending their relationship with a phone call was just wrong.</p><p>She saw Cal drive into the lot next to the park and climb out of his pickup. Her heart went on alert, and her pulse accelerated at the sight of him. The memory of all the good times they\u2019d had together brought hot, stinging tears to her eyes. That embarrassed her, and she quickly blinked them away. As Cal approached, she stood up.</p><p>He looked tanned and handsome, even more attractive than he\u2019d looked before. He wore jeans and a Western-style shirt, and his Stetson was pulled forward to shade his face.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said evenly. \u201cWelcome back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks,\u201d was his reply. He stood awkwardly in front of her, his thumbs hooked in his jeans pockets. \u201cIt\u2019s good to be home.\u201d No hint of a stutter, she noticed.</p><p>She sat down again and he joined her on the bottom bleacher. For a few seconds, neither said a word. To Linnette\u2019s way of thinking, Cal should be the first to speak.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you, Linnette.\u201d</p><p>Well, it was too late for that. She was deeply hurt, and fighting not to show it. She tried to tell him to save his breath, but the words didn\u2019t make it past the constriction in her throat.</p><p>\u201cI never meant to fall in love with Vicki.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure you love her?\u201d That was the important question.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d Cal said. \u201cWe have a lot in common.\u201d</p><p>If this was supposed to make her feel better, it hadn\u2019t worked.</p><p>She could see that he was waiting for her to say something, and despite the emotions that simmered inside her, she couldn\u2019t. She\u2019d wanted this meeting and agreed to see him when he\u2019d phoned. She didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d expected\u2014certainly not this crush of pain and loss. Perhaps it would\u2019ve been best to simply walk away and not look back.</p><p>Cal glanced at her. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to yell at me or anything?\u201d</p><p>She managed a smile and stared down at her feet in their neat, polished pumps. \u201cI thought I would, especially when you first told me. I guess I\u2019m past the angry stage.\u201d She wasn\u2019t really, but couldn\u2019t see any point in discussing it or telling him it often took years to get over rejection. At least that was how she felt about it.</p> <p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t have much experience in relationships,\u201d she said. This grief was new to her, a life-lesson she didn\u2019t want to learn\u2014or repeat.</p><p>\u201cI know and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know any more about relationships than I do,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d Cal murmured amenably. \u201cI think we both liked the idea of being in love.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t agree with him, but there was no reason to argue. \u201cPerhaps,\u201d was all she said.</p><p>Cal sighed and looked out over the cove. \u201cI guess your entire family\u2019s upset with me, and I\u2019m sorry about that. I like your family.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cMom and Dad both think you\u2019re the greatest thing since flu shots.\u201d</p><p>Cal cracked a smile. Then, apparently feeling it was necessary to predict a positive future for her, he said, \u201cOne day you\u2019re going to meet someone who\u2019ll love you more than I did.\u201d</p> <p>Linnette supposed Cal meant that as a compliment, but it didn\u2019t sound like one. \u201cI should hope so. I\u2019d hate to think getting dumped is going to be a regular occurrence for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Then, to her dismay, a tear escaped. Hoping he hadn\u2019t noticed, she quickly wiped it away. She hadn\u2019t anticipated this heart-wrenching sense of regret and wasn\u2019t sure how to react to it. She\u2019d truly loved Cal and tried to help him. Perhaps that was where she\u2019d gone wrong. Perhaps no man wanted to be helped by the woman he loved\u2014or thought he loved.</p><p>\u201cVicki asked me if she should come and talk to you herself. I\u2014I didn\u2019t think that was a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not.\u201d Linnette figured it wouldn\u2019t look too impressive if one of the community health-care professionals scratched out another\u2019s woman\u2019s eyes. The thought produced a near smile.</p><p>\u201cI have an announcement of my own,\u201d she said with false enthusiasm.</p><p>Cal looked directly at her then, for the first time since their conversation began.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve decided to leave Cedar Cove.\u201d She made it sound as if she\u2019d received the opportunity of a lifetime, when no such prospect existed. In fact, she\u2019d be breaking her contract and her lease, packing her bags and walking away with no destination and no plans.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re moving?\u201d He seemed shocked by that.</p><p>She was astonished that he actually thought she\u2019d stay in Cedar Cove.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to see other states.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a job?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Not yet she didn\u2019t. But it shouldn\u2019t be a problem finding employment in one of the small towns that dotted middle America. \u201cDo you think I\u2019d move without a job?\u201d she asked, implying what she knew he wanted to hear.</p><p>\u201cWhat did your parents say?\u201d</p><p>Of course she hadn\u2019t told them yet. This had been a recent decision\u2014made all of two minutes ago. And yet...it felt right.</p><p>She had to leave Cedar Cove. It was difficult enough to recover from a broken heart, but it would become impossible if she had to see Cal and Vicki around town. No, the only reasonable solution was to pack her bags.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Cal said wretchedly. Linnette knew he was sincere. In two words he\u2019d told her he would have spared her this pain if he could.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d she said with a flippant air. \u201cI\u2019m learning lessons most girls learn in high school. I...I always was a late bloomer.\u201d</p><p>She stood abruptly, needing to get away. \u201cGoodbye, Cal.\u201d</p><p>He stood, too, looking at the ground, shuffling his feet, obviously ill at ease. \u201cI\u2019ll always be grateful to you.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d be grateful. Well, that was nice, but it didn\u2019t make up for the fact that he didn\u2019t love her anymore. Linnette walked home to her waterfront apartment, which wouldn\u2019t be home for much longer, and climbed the stairs. Not once did she glance back, which was an accomplishment of its own.</p><p>Coward that she was, Linnette phoned the medical facility so she could talk to the personnel director and give notice verbally. A formal letter would be coming, she said. When she got off the phone, she wrote and printed out the letter, as promised. And then, because she needed to do something physical, she pulled out her suitcases and started to pack.</p><p>Forty minutes later, her doorbell chimed, and for a fleeting moment, hope emerged and had her rushing to answer the door. But it wasn\u2019t Cal, and she\u2019d been deluded to even think it might\u2019ve been. Instead Dr. Chad Timmons stood there.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve given your notice?\u201d he demanded, pushing his way past her, irritation written on his face. He was still dressed in his whites and had obviously come straight from the clinic.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, too late. I\u2019ve already had that discussion with Alma McDonald,\u201d Linnette said without emotion. \u201cI\u2019ve written my letter of resignation. Besides, what makes you think you can force me to stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t leave,\u201d Chad insisted, his hard gaze holding hers. \u201cOkay, so you had an important relationship go sour. Happens to all of us sooner or later.\u201d</p><p>It had never happened to her until now, and she wasn\u2019t sticking around to see Cal and his new girlfriend together at every community function. Perhaps a stronger, better woman would be capable of that, but Linnette couldn\u2019t do it.</p><p>\u201cDo you intend to run away every time you hit a difficult patch emotionally?\u201d he asked. \u201cIs this the kind of pattern you want to set in your life? Come on, Linnette, get a grip. You\u2019re an adult. Act like one.\u201d</p><p>The harshness of his words felt like an attack. She stood up to it, though. In little more than a year, she\u2019d experienced two disappointments in romance. She wanted out. Okay, her reactions were childish; she didn\u2019t care. Besides, she didn\u2019t know why Chad felt so concerned about this, since he was interested in Gloria, not her. Fine, she\u2019d dealt with that, and really it hadn\u2019t been so painful because Cal had entered her life. She\u2019d sure made a mess of that relationship.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she said, meeting his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know where I land.\u201d</p><p>Chad frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re really going?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. No one else knew yet. She still had to tell her parents and Gloria, but she was leaving Cedar Cove.</p><p>That much was certain, even if nothing else was.</p><p>Forty-Three</p><p>\u201cAllison.\u201d Her father\u2019s voice rang over her cell phone. \u201cCould you stop by the sheriff\u2019s office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d she asked, glancing regretfully at her two friends. She was on her way to the Silverdale Mall for a much-needed shopping break. Her mom had let her use the car, and Allison had volunteered to drive. Since graduation, all she\u2019d done was work at her dad\u2019s office. She had less and less of a social life these days. It seemed pointless to date anyone else, because no matter how this whole arson mess ended, she loved Anson.</p><p>\u201cYes, now,\u201d her father insisted. \u201cIt\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes...does this have anything to do with Anson?\u201d Her friends looked at her, and their conversation instantly died.</p><p>\u201cIt does.\u201d</p><p>Her heart leaped into her throat. \u201cI\u2019ll be there in ten minutes.\u201d After apologizing to her friends as she dropped them at a bus stop, Allison reversed her direction and headed back into Cedar Cove. Her stomach was in knots. Something had happened.</p><p>The sheriff\u2019s door was closed, and Seth and Justine Gunderson sat outside his office. So did Roy McAfee, the private investigator she\u2019d once gone to on Anson\u2019s behalf. They all smiled warmly when they saw her.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said nervously.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Justine said. \u201cI think you\u2019re supposed to wait here, too.\u201d</p><p>Allison took the fourth chair and twisted her purse strap around her palm. \u201cIs my father talking to the sheriff?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Mr. Gunderson nodded. He began to speak, but the door opened then, and her father stepped into the hallway. He brightened when he saw her.</p><p>\u201cCan you tell me what this is about, Dad?\u201d she asked, coming to her feet.</p><p>\u201cI sure can.\u201d Her father smiled. \u201cActually, it wasn\u2019t Sheriff Davis or I who asked to see you.\u201d He held open the door and gestured her inside.</p><p>Wondering at his words, Allison entered the small office and noticed Sheriff Davis right away. A soldier stood next to him, a handsome young man, wearing fatigues and a cap. The name tag on his jacket said Butler.</p><p>Butler.</p><p>No, it couldn\u2019t be. Allison looked again. It was.</p><p>\u201cAnson?\u201d she whispered, hardly able to believe what she saw. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He smiled and held out his arms. Even with her father and the sheriff watching, she didn\u2019t hesitate. Allison rushed forward for the biggest, most precious hug of her life. Her throat was crowded with tears of joy. \u201cYou enlisted in the army? All this time you were in the army?\u201d</p><p>Anson grinned. \u201cThere aren\u2019t a whole lot of options for someone hoping to escape a few unpleasant complications.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d she asked, astounded at the changes in him. He looked better, healthier than at any other time she\u2019d seen him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d made the decision before the fire that burned down The Lighthouse. I talked to a recruiter and saw there were more opportunities for me with the military than anyplace else. I enlisted in Silverdale. Even though I was a \u2018person of interest\u2019 with regard to the fire, I wasn\u2019t charged with anything, so it didn\u2019t stand in my way. I had all the credits I needed to graduate.\u201d</p> <p>Relieved though she was, Allison felt angry, too. He could have trusted her! \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to graduate from basic training first\u2014prove I could do it. I needed to consider my choices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo return to Cedar Cove and answer a few questions, for one,\u201d Sheriff Davis put in.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t drag you into this,\u201d Anson said, turning to Allison.</p> <p>\u201cAnson wasn\u2019t responsible for the fire,\u201d she argued, ready to do battle even now.</p><p>\u201cWe already know that,\u201d her father assured her.</p><p>\u201cWe have another person of interest we\u2019re planning to question,\u201d Sheriff Davis explained. He nodded at Anson. \u201cWe appreciate your help, son. You\u2019re free to go.\u201d They exchanged handshakes. \u201cThanks to you,\u201d he added, \u201cwe\u2019re pretty sure who set that fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir,\u201d Anson said respectfully. He turned to Zach. \u201cDo I have your permission to speak to Allison privately, Mr. Cox?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Allison\u2019s father smiled at his daughter. \u201cIf I said no, I fear I\u2019d have a family mutiny on my hands.\u201d</p><p>It was all Allison could do not to hug her father. Before anything could prevent their departure, she linked her hand with Anson\u2019s, and they walked out together. As they were leaving, Sheriff Davis asked the Gundersons to step into his office.</p> <p>Allison had so many questions, she wasn\u2019t sure which one to ask first. \u201cYou know who set the fire?\u201d she blurted out. \u201cWas it because of the license plate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPartly. I didn\u2019t know his name, but I\u2019d seen him around town. He saw me, and I knew it wasn\u2019t safe for me to stick around, so I ran. The way I figured it, with my record, I\u2019d get blamed for the fire anyway.\u201d They left the building and before they could walk toward the parking lot, Anson stopped abruptly. He pulled her under an outside stairwell. \u201cListen, Allison, I know this is crazy, but I swear if I don\u2019t kiss you right here and now, I\u2019ll lose my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI was thinking that, too.\u201d</p><p>Anson took her into his arms and brought his mouth to hers. She\u2019d waited months and months for this kiss, and she wasn\u2019t going to let the fact that anyone could see them detract from the joy she felt.</p><p>\u201cI have missed you so much,\u201d she murmured, her arms around his neck.</p><p>\u201cThinking about you was all that got me through basic training,\u201d Anson murmured as he ran his hands down her back.</p><p>They clung to each other for the longest time. Finally Allison couldn\u2019t stand not knowing, couldn\u2019t stand it for another second. \u201cWho did it?\u201d she asked breathlessly. \u201cWho started the fire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, I didn\u2019t know his name but I\u2019d seen him in the restaurant and around town. He\u2019s a builder, I guess. It wasn\u2019t until very recently that I found out who he is. Warren Saget.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWarren Saget,\u201d Allison repeated. \u201cMy dad does his taxes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. Your father mentioned that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you identify him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis picture was in the paper. Shaw\u2019s been mailing me the Cedar Cove Chronicle, which is how I managed to keep up with what\u2019s been happening around town. Saget was photographed in an ad for his construction company. Once I had a name to go with the face, I phoned the sheriff.\u201d He smiled grimly. \u201cThe license plate\u2014first three letters SUL\u2014checked out.\u201d</p><p>It was one thing to identify Warren Saget as the arsonist and another to prove it. All the information she\u2019d seen and read\u2014on TV shows and in mystery novels\u2014indicated that there had to be more than circumstantial evidence or even eyewitness reports. The only physical evidence was the pewter cross discovered in the ashes\u2014the cross that belonged to Anson.</p><p>\u201cHow will Sheriff Davis ever prove he\u2019s the arsonist?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m a witness and I\u2019ve agreed to testify in court. The sheriff and Mr. McAfee had another idea, though. He didn\u2019t tell me what it was, but it involves Mrs. Gunderson. That\u2019s why she was there with her husband. My guess,\u201d he said thoughtfully, \u201cis that Sheriff Davis is going to arrange a showdown, a face to face with Saget.\u201d Anson shook his head. \u201cThe sheriff didn\u2019t confide in me. All I know is that if it\u2019s necessary, I\u2019ll testify against him in court.\u201d</p><p>She had another question, an important one. \u201cHow did my dad get involved?\u201d</p><p>Anson rested his forehead against hers. \u201cI called him. It was on his advice that I spoke to the sheriff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He couldn\u2019t have shocked her more had he confessed to setting the fire himself. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast Friday. Like I said, I saw Saget\u2019s photograph and recognized him as the arsonist. I figured if I was ever going to step forward, the time was now. Otherwise I was afraid this would hang over me for the rest of my life. Your dad arranged today\u2019s meeting.\u201d He paused. \u201cThere are only a handful of people I trust in this world, and your father is one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me?\u201d She realized she sounded hurt; she couldn\u2019t help it, even though she wanted to be more mature.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t put you in that situation.\u201d He kissed her again, letting his lips linger on hers. \u201cI knew you wanted to believe in me. All I could do was pray that your father did, too.\u201d</p><p>Her father hadn\u2019t breathed a word of this.</p><p>\u201cHow long can you stay?\u201d Allison already dreaded the day he\u2019d have to leave her again.</p><p>\u201cJust a week, and then I\u2019m headed for specialized training. I\u2019m going into Army Intelligence, working with computers. Whether I continue with the military or not, this is training I can always use.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one of the smartest people I know.\u201d She couldn\u2019t keep the admiration from her voice.</p><p>He\u2019d never been able to accept compliments well. He did now, though, because he believed it himself. \u201cYou\u2019re the only person who ever said that to me, and the funny part is, the tests I took proved it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter I enlisted, the army put me through a lot of testing. I ranked high in languages and computer skills and a bunch of other stuff. Basically, I could have my pick, and I went with Army Intelligence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so proud of you, Anson, so proud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who gave me the power to believe in myself,\u201d he said.</p><p>They left their haven under the stairwell and walked into the parking lot. Allison unlocked her mom\u2019s car, and Anson slid into the passenger seat beside her. \u201cWhere would you like to go?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d like to see my mother first. I have her money. Then Shaw.\u201d He grinned. \u201cI don\u2019t think either of them will recognize me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t at first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said with a delighted laugh. \u201cI wish you could\u2019ve seen the look on your face when it dawned on you that this short-haired soldier was me. It was priceless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019re funny, don\u2019t you?\u201d she said, laughing, too.</p><p>\u201cNo, I think I\u2019m the most fortunate man in Cedar Cove. I don\u2019t need to run or hide. I have you back, and my life\u2019s on course. For the first time ever, I can smile at the future.\u201d</p><p>So could Allison.</p><p>Forty-Four</p><p>In Rachel\u2019s opinion, dinner with Nate\u2019s parents on Tuesday evening couldn\u2019t have gone worse. She\u2019d felt miserable and out of her element the entire evening. They were in an outrageously expensive Seattle restaurant, where each place setting featured more cutlery than Rachel owned. That was bad enough. Even worse was the fact that Nate didn\u2019t even seem to notice how uncomfortable she was. Nate\u2019s mother had used every opportunity to belittle Rachel, and she\u2019d done it in the most subtle way. Again and again, she brought up subjects that excluded Rachel and made no effort to explain who or what she meant.</p><p>Once when Rachel had the temerity to ask a question about someone she\u2019d mentioned, Patrice Olsen raised her eyebrows\u2014as if it should be understood that she was referring to the English ambassador\u2019s daughter. Following that, Rachel hadn\u2019t dared ask a single thing. They\u2019d all started off on the wrong foot the night Nate had showed up at her house, his parents in tow. The fact that Bruce and Jolene were there seemed to give his mother even more of a reason to dislike her. Patrice obviously assumed that Rachel was cheating on her son.</p><p>After dinner, which seemed to last forever, Nate wished his parents a safe trip home. He appeared to be pleased with what he considered a successful evening. Now as he drove Rachel home, she tried to figure out how Nate had missed his mother\u2019s unmistakable attempts to thwart their relationship.</p><p>\u201cI told you there was nothing to worry about,\u201d Nate said, briefly glancing away from the road. His right hand reached for hers and gave it a gentle squeeze. He looked happy and content, while Rachel felt just the opposite. \u201cI knew the minute Mom met you, she\u2019d love you, too,\u201d he continued, \u201cand I was right. Mom thinks you\u2019re fabulous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you say that?\u201d she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. \u201cI was a nervous wreck all night.\u201d She didn\u2019t mention their initial introduction, but surely he could guess that was part of the reason!</p><p>\u201cYou were?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, close to tears. \u201cNate, I was so far out of my comfort zone I could hardly breathe.\u201d</p><p>He glanced away from the road again. \u201cIt didn\u2019t show. You\u2019re a classy woman, Rach, and my parents thought you were great, but I knew they would.\u201d</p><p>Apparently he hadn\u2019t noticed that she hadn\u2019t swallowed a single bite of that expensive dinner. \u201cYour parents really care about you,\u201d she said.</p><p>Nate shrugged. \u201cDad and I have had our differences over the years. As you already know, he didn\u2019t approve when I enlisted in the navy. We had a big blowup about that, but underneath it all, I know he\u2019s proud of me and my decision. He\u2019s come to trust my judgment. Mom, too.\u201d He cast a meaningful look in her direction as they drove across the Tacoma Narrows Bridge on their way back into Cedar Cove. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYour parents have plenty of reasons to be proud of you, Nate.\u201d All Rachel wanted was to get home. Her head hurt and her cheeks ached from constantly smiling. She had less of a problem with Nate\u2019s father; unlike his wife, Nathaniel Olsen was a straight shooter. Mrs. Olsen had made it evident from the moment they were introduced that she found Rachel lacking. No, even before tonight, Rachel thought, recalling the phone conversation in the park. It wasn\u2019t anything personal; his mother just didn\u2019t consider Rachel Pendergast good enough for her only son.</p><p>They got to her house before Rachel was ready. She didn\u2019t want Nate to leave and yet at the same time she wanted to be alone. How could she explain the way his mother made her feel? If she tried, Nate would assume she was being paranoid and childish.</p><p>Nate parked his car at the curb and turned to smile at her. The look in his eyes told her he wasn\u2019t ready for the evening to end, either.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to come in and talk for a bit?\u201d Rachel asked. There was nothing to do at the moment but put tonight\u2019s dinner behind her. Later, when she\u2019d had time to assimilate the evening\u2019s events, she\u2019d be able to make some decisions.</p> <p>\u201cI would love a cup of coffee,\u201d Nate said and gently kissed her. His kisses had always been her downfall. The first time they\u2019d kissed, Rachel had felt her world crumble at her feet. That hadn\u2019t changed in the months they\u2019d been seeing each other; if anything the physical attraction between them had grown stronger.</p><p>Nate helped her out of the car and when they\u2019d walked up to her front door, he took the keys from her hand and unlocked it for her. He observed these small courtesies, old-fashioned courtesies, which he\u2019d obviously grown up with. The contrast between Nate and Bruce when it came to these details of courtship was striking. Not that she was dating Bruce. The fact that he\u2019d even enter her mind at a time like this was an irritation she could do without.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said when Nate gave her back the key ring. The living room was dark and she switched on a lamp on her way into the kitchen. Although she wasn\u2019t really interested in coffee, preparing a pot gave her something to do while she collected her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like you\u2019ve got a message on your answering machine,\u201d Nate commented as he pulled out a kitchen chair.</p><p>Without thinking, Rachel pushed the button. Almost immediately she heard Jolene\u2019s sweet voice. \u201cHi, Rachel.\u201d She sounded disappointed not to find Rachel at home. \u201cI wish you were there. I was hoping we could go to a movie together. Dad says the one I want to see is a chick flick and I should ask you.\u201d She gave an exasperated sigh that made Rachel laugh. \u201cYou know men. Call me back soon, okay?\u201d</p> <p>Suddenly she saw that Nate was frowning. \u201cThey take a lot for granted, don\u2019t they?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d Now Rachel frowned, finding herself oddly defensive of Bruce and Jolene.</p><p>\u201cI have news,\u201d Nate said. He\u2019d waited until after she\u2019d poured him a mug of coffee.</p><p>\u201cGood news, I hope,\u201d she said as she joined him at the table. She stirred a teaspoon of sugar into her coffee.</p><p>\u201cRachel.\u201d He reached across the table, stilling her hand. \u201cThe George Washington has been transferred to San Diego.\u201d</p><p>It took longer than it should have to understand what that meant. \u201cYou\u2019re leaving Cedar Cove?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>He nodded. \u201cI wanted to say something sooner, but with my parents in town and you so busy most of the time...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been that busy at work,\u201d she countered. \u201cNot since Teri got back.\u201d But she knew what he\u2019d say. Twice in the last month, he\u2019d wanted to go out and she\u2019d had to turn him down because of previous commitments to Jolene.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re always doing something with that girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has a name, Nate. It\u2019s Jolene, and she\u2019s my friend.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s healthy for you to spend so much time with her.\u201d</p><p>The anger Rachel experienced was hot and immediate, but she forced it back. This wasn\u2019t the time to discuss her relationship with Jolene. There were other pressing matters at hand. It had only begun to sink in that Nate would be leaving Cedar Cove. \u201cYou...you should\u2019ve said you were being transferred,\u201d she said. \u201cYou should\u2019ve told me earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He covered her hands and gazed into her eyes. \u201cI hate to tell you like this,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cespecially since we\u2019re heading out so soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d she asked in a strained voice.</p> <p>\u201cNext week.\u201d</p><p>She gasped. \u201cNo...\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d She didn\u2019t know how to react to this shocking news. The evening and the uncomfortable dinner were the least of her worries now. Nate had been transferred. Within a week, this man she loved would be gone.</p><p>Her mouth went dry. \u201cWhat will that mean for us?\u201d she managed to ask.</p><p>\u201cIt means,\u201d Nate said, exhaling deeply, \u201cthat you and I need to make a decision. A very important decision.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach tensed, and she could hear her heart pounding in her ears.</p><p>He paused as if to gauge her response to his announcement. \u201cYou know how I feel about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d She felt the same way about him. Although he was a few years younger and the son of a wealthy and powerful politician, he\u2019d managed to steal her heart. During the six months he\u2019d been at sea, they\u2019d written each other long letters, then later e-mailed on a daily basis, and in the process had grown close. When she\u2019d first learned about his family, she\u2019d wanted to end their relationship, but he\u2019d persuaded her not to. Now the navy was taking him away from her.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the others?\u201d She\u2019d become good friends with several of the navy wives, especially Cecilia Randall. Since Aaron\u2019s birth, she hadn\u2019t seen as much of Cecilia, and now Rachel understood why. Cecilia was adjusting to more than her newborn son, more than her move to Grace Harding\u2019s house on Rosewood Lane. She was packing up for San Diego.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all moving, too,\u201d he said, \u201cAlmost everyone associated with the George Washington has been transferred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She hoped there\u2019d be an opportunity to say goodbye to her friends and to exchange addresses and promises to keep in touch.</p><p>\u201cI want you to think about something,\u201d Nate continued. \u201cI want you to go there, too.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t be serious! Did he expect her to pack up her own life and become a camp follower?</p><p>\u201cWith your job you could work anywhere, right?\u201d</p><p>He left her reeling from one shock and then another. \u201cYou want me to move, too? Just like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s a lot to ask. I know it\u2019s unfair, but I have a reason for asking.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter. \u201cI can\u2019t, Nate. My life is here in Cedar Cove. My closest friends are here\u2014Teri and Jane and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJolene,\u201d Nate finished.</p><p>\u201cYes, Jolene,\u201d she confirmed. If Rachel moved, the child would be devastated. She\u2019d lost her mother a few years ago, and Rachel\u2019s leaving would make her feel like she\u2019d been abandoned a second time. Rachel couldn\u2019t do that to her.</p><p>Nate brought her hand to his lips and gently kissed her knuckles. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we give it three months?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Already she missed him. She knew instinctively that this would be different from when he was at sea. \u201cThree months,\u201d she repeated, wondering, Three months until what?</p><p>\u201cAt the end of three months, we should both know,\u201d Nate said casually.</p><p>\u201cKnow what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf this is something we can do, live apart like this,\u201d Nate explained, again sounding very casual, as if everything was clear. As if she understood.</p><p>She frowned slightly. \u201cAnd if we decide we can\u2019t, what will that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hoping it means you\u2019ll be willing to join me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoin you?\u201d</p><p>Nate\u2019s sensual mouth turned upward in a warm, inviting smile. \u201cIn other words, Rachel, I\u2019m hoping you\u2019ll consider becoming my wife.\u201d</p><p>Forty-Five</p><p>Teri took a bite of her taco salad and realized that her appetite just wasn\u2019t what it used to be. Love did that to her. When Ray had first moved in with her, she\u2019d lost ten pounds. Of course, that weight had reappeared, plus five additional pounds once she\u2019d kicked him out, but that was beside the point. This time she was living with the right man and she\u2019d never been happier in her life. In fact, she hadn\u2019t expected to be this happy, ever. Falling in love with a decent man who loved her back didn\u2019t happen to women like her. Only it had, and she thanked God every day for bringing Bobby into her life.</p><p>\u201cAre you taking your lunch break now?\u201d Teri said to Rachel, who\u2019d wandered into the lunchroom. Her friend had been depressed all morning. Yesterday, she\u2019d gotten the news that Nate was shipping out, and she was taking it hard.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be with you in a minute,\u201d Rachel said as she slipped a Lean Cuisine meal into the microwave and punched in four minutes. \u201cThe truth is, I don\u2019t have much of an appetite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, neither,\u201d Teri moaned. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen,\u201d Jane said, coming into the room. \u201cThat\u2019s usually what it is, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Teri laughed. \u201cI miss Bobby,\u201d she admitted. She probably said this a dozen times a day. In order to maintain his ranking, he had to play tournaments all over the world. Teri hoped that in a year or two, he\u2019d be able to slow down this relentless pace.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he now?\u201d Jane asked, waiting for her turn at the microwave.</p><p>\u201cNew York City.\u201d She\u2019d talked to him before she left for work. \u201cHe wants me to meet him there this weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going?\u201d</p><p>Teri shrugged indifferently, although she was dying to be with Bobby and to see his Manhattan apartment. She might even talk him into taking her to a real Broadway show. Aw, who was she kidding? When Bobby was in a tournament, chess was his sole focus. With one exception\u2014their honeymoon. They\u2019d had another subject on their minds in Las Vegas, and it didn\u2019t have anything to do with gambling. Just thinking about the hours they\u2019d spent in bed made her miss her husband even more.</p><p>\u201cYou really love that chess geek, don\u2019t you?\u201d Jane said, watching her closely.</p><p>\u201cBobby isn\u2019t a geek.\u201d He was, but Teri had no intention of admitting it, especially to Jane. \u201cHe\u2019s a genius, and he needs me, and yes, I love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe likes her macaroni and cheese, too,\u201d Rachel teased, smiling at Teri.</p><p>\u201cYou just wait,\u201d Teri told her friends as the microwave buzzed. \u201cOne day you\u2019re going to fall this much in love and then you\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRachel is in love, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Jane said, stepping around her to insert her frozen entr\u00e9e into the microwave. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Rachel said, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t expect love to be this complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d Jane asked, crossing her arms and leaning against the wall.</p><p>Rachel seemed about to explain, then changed her mind. Sighing, she lifted one shoulder. \u201cIt just is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to follow Nate to San Diego?\u201d Teri asked. She\u2019d hate it if Rachel moved away. Get Nailed wouldn\u2019t be the same without her, although she also wondered how long she\u2019d be able to maintain her own splintered life, with Bobby\u2019s home on the east coast and hers on the west. More and more, she felt that her place was with her husband. They needed each other, although it was an odd feeling to need anyone. Being needed, yes; she was used to that. But needing someone? Having lived her life as independently as possible, Teri found this difficult to grasp.</p> <p>Still, she didn\u2019t want to leave Cedar Cove. And she didn\u2019t know how these new contradictions in her life could be resolved.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do,\u201d Rachel said.</p><p>\u201cJust remember,\u201d Jane told her, \u201cif you marry Nate, you\u2019re married to the United States Navy, too. You go where they tell you and when they tell you, and you do it without complaint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, aye, Captain,\u201d Rachel teased, saluting Jane. She sat down and dipped her fork in the steaming chicken and rice entr\u00e9e. \u201cActually, it isn\u2019t the navy that scares me. I can deal with navy life, but I\u2019m not sure I can cope with Nate\u2019s mother.\u201d</p><p>Just then, Denise, the receptionist, came into the break room. \u201cThere\u2019s someone here to see you,\u201d she said, directing the comment to Teri.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have an appointment until one,\u201d she muttered, eyeing her half-eaten lunch.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a customer,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s that tall, skinny driver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames?\u201d The only reason James would be in Cedar Cove was if he\u2019d driven Bobby.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s someone else with him, too,\u201d Denise added, curling her lip as if to say she didn\u2019t like his companion. \u201cA big, beefy guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right with Bobby?\u201d Teri asked, instantly concerned. She immediately set aside her salad and got to her feet.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t say,\u201d Denise told her.</p> <p>Pushing back the drape, Teri hurried into the salon foyer. Sure enough, James was there. She didn\u2019t recognize the man with him. Like Denise said, he resembled a wrestler with huge biceps beneath a black suit.</p><p>\u201cTeri,\u201d James said. \u201cCome with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Bobby with you?\u201d she asked</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in the car,\u201d the other man answered for him, speaking with a heavy accent. One Teri couldn\u2019t identify.</p><p>\u201cHe is? Why didn\u2019t you say so?\u201d She started out of the shop, with James and his friend following behind. But when she entered the mall parking lot, she couldn\u2019t see the limo.</p><p>\u201cOver there,\u201d James said, pointing.</p><p>The other man led the way to a white van, where a third man waited. \u201cJames?\u201d she asked, suddenly suspicious. Something wasn\u2019t right.</p><p>James avoided her gaze.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she asked urgently.</p><p>\u201cJust do what he tells you,\u201d Bobby\u2019s driver instructed her in a quiet voice.</p><p>\u201cNow, just a minute,\u201d Teri said, standing her ground. She wasn\u2019t about to walk off with this...this gangster, not without a very good reason, anyway. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d she asked again.</p><p>James\u2019s cell phone rang, and he looked at the other man before answering. The wrestler type nodded, and James flipped it open. His gaze shot to Teri.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s with me,\u201d he answered, his voice unnaturally high. \u201cNo, no, we haven\u2019t been hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that Bobby?\u201d Teri asked. She noticed that the big guy was walking away.</p><p>James nodded.</p><p>\u201cGive me the phone,\u201d she said, and James complied. \u201cBobby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding,\u201d Teri said. \u201cWhat\u2019s all this about? Did they threaten you?\u201d She was tempted to race after the big guy and give him a kick he wouldn\u2019t forget. How dare he frighten Bobby this way! \u201cYou don\u2019t have anything to worry about,\u201d she assured her husband. \u201cI can take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>Bobby didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cGive me James,\u201d he said a moment later.</p><p>Teri handed the cell phone back to his driver. The two spoke for a few minutes and then James closed the phone. He offered her a tentative smile. \u201cNothing\u2019s going to happen,\u201d he announced, his voice trembling.</p><p>\u201cDid those gorillas threaten Bobby?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d James said, wiping the perspiration from his forehead. \u201cThey threatened you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d she cried. \u201cI\u2019d like to see them try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you wouldn\u2019t,\u201d James said in the same shaky voice. \u201cTrust me, you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The outrage was building in her. \u201cWho are they?\u201d she demanded. The first thing she intended to do was inform the sheriff and have them arrested for\u2014she didn\u2019t know what but she\u2019d find out. Uttering threats? Blackmail? They were clearly guilty of something.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know exactly who they are.\u201d James seemed on the verge of collapse.</p><p>Teri took him back inside the shop and into the break room, which had emptied. Jane and Rachel cast her quizzical looks, but she ignored them both.</p><p>\u201cThat was just to let Bobby know they could get to you anytime they wanted,\u201d James told her.</p><p>If this was supposed to frighten Teri, it didn\u2019t. Perhaps she was being foolish, but she really could take care of herself. Bobby had enough on his mind without worrying about her.</p><p>As soon as James was seated, Teri poured him a glass of cold water, which he drank in giant gulps.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said angrily. \u201cHow much money did they want?\u201d</p><p>James stared at her. \u201cThey weren\u2019t after money.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. What was the point of this charade if it wasn\u2019t money?</p><p>\u201cThey want Bobby to throw a chess match,\u201d James explained.</p><p>That was when Teri started to laugh. \u201cThey don\u2019t know, do they?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know what?\u201d James asked.</p><p>Teri shook her head. \u201cDon\u2019t they realize how much my husband hates to lose?\u201d</p><p>Forty-Six</p><p>Justine had arranged to meet Warren Saget at D.D.\u2019s On the Cove. Even now, several days after the shocking revelations, she had difficulty believing he\u2019d set the fire. It tore her up to think he could hurt her like this, and yet in a strange way, it all made sense.</p><p>Warren already had a table and was waiting for her when she arrived. He stood as she entered the room and held out a chair for her. This meeting hadn\u2019t been her idea, but she\u2019d agreed to it, although neither Sheriff Davis nor Seth fully understood what they were asking of her.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how happy it made me to get your phone call this morning,\u201d Warren said the moment she was seated.</p><p>In an effort to hide her uneasiness, Justine reached for the linen napkin and smoothed it across her lap. \u201cI appreciate your willingness to have lunch at the last minute like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould I refuse you anything?\u201d Warren asked gallantly. His gaze was warm and appreciative. \u201cI want to be your knight in shining armor\u2014you know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d she said, and in a flash she understood what had led this man to do the things he\u2019d done. Later, she\u2019d discuss her insight with Seth, but right now she had a role to play.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d Warren asked.</p><p>Justine mentally reviewed the tips Sheriff Davis had given her to guide the conversation. \u201cI talked with an architect about building the Victorian Tea Room,\u201d she began.</p><p>\u201cFabulous. You do want me to look over the plans, don\u2019t you, and give you a construction bid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be wonderful.\u201d She pretended to glance at the menu. \u201cBy the way, Seth met with the insurance people this morning, and there\u2019s been an interesting development in the case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>As she suspected, Warren\u2019s interest was immediately awakened. \u201cIt\u2019s all rather complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cComplicated? How?\u201d</p><p>Justine shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t want to discuss the fire\u2014it upsets me. I still can\u2019t believe anyone would do something like that deliberately.\u201d</p><p>Warren nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s a cold, dark world out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be a logical reason anyone would want to hurt us. It just seems...irrational. I mean, there\u2019s no financial gain to be had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you think it was personal?\u201d Warren asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat else can I think?\u201d she responded. \u201cWhoever did this must hate me. Whoever did this must\u2019ve been looking for a means to hurt me and my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot you, Justine,\u201d Warren said quickly. He glanced down at his own menu.</p><p>\u201cHurt Seth, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the one who laid off that dishwasher, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Warren muttered.</p><p>She leaned toward him and placed her elbows on the table. \u201cThat\u2019s the interesting thing about all of this, Warren. Apparently it wasn\u2019t the young man we assumed. We have positive proof that Anson Butler wasn\u2019t involved in the fire.\u201d</p><p>Warren frowned. \u201cI thought I read that his cross was found in the ashes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one ever said it was his cross.\u201d Justine met his gaze.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I\u2019m wrong, but it seems to me I heard that somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might have,\u201d Justine agreed. \u201cAll the evidence certainly pointed to Anson.\u201d Outwardly she remained calm, in contrast with the wild pounding of her heart. Turning to the menu again, she added, \u201cSome other evidence has recently come to light. That\u2019s why Sheriff Davis contacted Seth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat evidence?\u201d Warren asked sharply.</p><p>Playing her role to the hilt, Justine looked away and then sighed. \u201cUnfortunately, I\u2019m not at liberty to discuss the details, but from what I understand, it\u2019s pretty damning.\u201d Step by step, she was leading him on, leading him to an admission of guilt.</p><p>Alert now, Warren leaned close and lowered his voice. \u201cYou can tell me, Justine. I can be trusted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you, Warren?\u201d she asked softly. And then, because this was so much more painful than she\u2019d realized it would be, she stopped and swallowed hard. Tears clogged her throat as she thought about the day of her panic attack and how Warren had seen her through it. His kindness had seemed genuine, and yet all along he\u2019d been the one responsible for bringing this sadness and stress into her life.</p><p>As best she could, she remained calm and set her menu aside. \u201cI\u2019ll have the crab cakes.\u201d</p><p>Warren nodded, but he didn\u2019t appear willing to drop the subject. \u201cTell me,\u201d he coaxed. \u201cYou\u2019ve always been able to trust me. What information does the sheriff have?\u201d</p><p>Justine met his gaze. \u201cYou honestly think I should tell you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAh...\u201d He seemed taken aback by that blunt question. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She had a hundred other questions she wanted to ask him. More and more she doubted she\u2019d ever have the opportunity. This conversation might be her only chance.</p><p>By now, Warren had started to squirm.</p><p>\u201cWarren,\u201d she said, looking straight at him, \u201cyou should know that the new evidence points directly to you.\u201d</p> <p>He issued a harsh laugh. \u201cThis is a joke, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish it was.\u201d She meant that. \u201cThe reason I asked to meet you is so I could find out why you\u2019d do such a thing.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened and he scooted back his chair as if about to flee.</p><p>\u201cIf I could only ask you one question,\u201d Justine whispered, \u201cit would be this.\u201d She paused, determined not to lose her composure. \u201cWhy, Warren? Why would you want to destroy the restaurant?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d gone completely pale. He lowered his gaze and seemed to struggle to find the words. \u201cSeeing you with Seth was...hard, knowing you\u2019d chosen him over me. You were the only woman who ever understood me, the only woman who didn\u2019t hold my sexual inadequacies over my head.\u201d The bitterness in his voice was frightening. \u201cI knew I had to find a way to get you back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, Warren.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen that day six or seven months ago when I came in for lunch, I managed to convince you to have a glass of wine with me...\u201d</p><p>Justine searched her memory. It\u2019d been the day David Rhodes had come by to have lunch with her grandmother. He\u2019d tried to weasel money out of Charlotte. Justine had been outraged and badly shaken by the events of that afternoon.</p><p>\u201cYou seemed so tired, so drained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was,\u201d she agreed but didn\u2019t explain why.</p><p>\u201cSeth showed up and when he saw you with me he was\u2014\u201d Warren just shook his head.</p> <p>Justine remembered that, too. There\u2019d been tension between her and Seth, and they\u2019d had an argument.</p><p>\u201cHe wore that smug look that told me no matter how much I loved and needed you, you were his and always would be his. Nothing,\u201d he said, \u201cabsolutely nothing I did would bring you back to me. At that moment, I knew I had to do something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut burn down the restaurant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to hurt Seth, not you,\u201d he said, pleading with her like a repentant child. \u201cI could never hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you did, Warren, you hurt us both.\u201d</p><p>He hung his head. \u201cI see that now. But I thought of a way to make it up to you. I\u2019d build you another restaurant, bigger and better than the first one. I\u2019d give you the restaurant of your dreams and then you\u2019d see how much I loved you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWarren, you don\u2019t prove your love by hurting other people.\u201d</p><p>He kept his eyes lowered and nodded sadly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Seth and Sheriff Davis walked across the room and stood next to the table. Warren looked up and sighed deeply. \u201cYou talked to the dishwasher, didn\u2019t you?\u201d he asked without showing any signs of distress. \u201cHe was there that night. He tried to put out the fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I understand.\u201d Sheriff Davis removed his handcuffs from his belt. \u201cWarren Saget, you have the right to remain silent....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, I know,\u201d he snapped irritably. He stood then and held out his hands. Glaring at Seth, he said, \u201cYou could never love her the way I do.\u201d</p><p>Justine stood, too, and Seth slipped his arm around her waist. \u201cNo one could possibly love my wife more than I do, Warren. I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s come to this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll deny everything,\u201d he sneered. \u201cI have a good attorney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but we\u2019ve got a confession right here on tape,\u201d Justine said, raising her shirt to reveal the wire taped to her midriff. \u201cWe have your confession, Warren, and you made these statements in a public place, in which you couldn\u2019t anticipate privacy. All the bases are covered.\u201d</p><p>Sheriff Davis clipped on the handcuffs and with everyone in the restaurant looking on, took Warren away.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over,\u201d Seth said as he led Justine from the room. The relief in his voice was unmistakable.</p><p>\u201cIn the end, I nearly couldn\u2019t do it,\u201d she said. \u201cEven knowing what he\u2019d done, I had trouble deceiving him.\u201d</p><p>Seth turned to face her. \u201cYou still got what we needed, and that was a confession. It didn\u2019t matter how you went about it\u2014all that matters is the end result.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that she loved Warren, but she pitied him and perhaps she always had.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help feeling sorry for him,\u201d she said as Seth opened the car door for her.</p><p>They were both silent during the drive home. \u201cIt\u2019s sad, you know,\u201d she said once they arrived.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you actually pity that slimeball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a way I do,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>Seth didn\u2019t say anything for a long moment. \u201cIn a way I do, too.\u201d He smiled at her and together they walked into the house. \u201cWe have the whole afternoon to ourselves, don\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>No one had expected Warren\u2019s arrest to go this smoothly. \u201cYes,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got another two hours before we have to collect Leif.\u201d</p><p>Justine threw her arms around her husband\u2019s neck. \u201cAny ideas for what we could do with that time?\u201d</p><p>Seth chuckled. \u201cGive me a minute and I might have a suggestion.\u201d Then, without warning, he swept her into his arms and carried her into the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Seth Gunderson,\u201d she said in an exaggerated Southern accent. \u201cJust what do you have in mind?\u201d She fluttered her eyelashes at him.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking,\u201d her husband said, a moment before his lips claimed hers, \u201cthat this would be the perfect opportunity to work on expanding the family.\u201d</p><p>Justine agreed that was a fine suggestion, indeed.</p><p>Bobby Polgar studied the note in his hand. He wasn\u2019t a man who understood fear, but he felt it now. Teri\u2019s life was being threatened. His wife and James had been confronted by ruthless men. The message was clear. These men could kidnap Teri at any time and he could do nothing to protect her. The note told him he was to return to 74 Seaside Avenue and wait for further instructions. </p> </body></html>"]
