The silky material provided no cushioning for her knees on the cold tile floor. But she should be used to misery\u2014 since the day she\u2019d been kidnapped, her life had held no comforts, just pain and abuse. And it looked about to get worse. Don\u2019t move. Don\u2019t tense. Don\u2019t show anger.</p><p>The Overseer stepped closer, his boots\u2014black like his soul\u2014entering her field of vision. \u201cThe three buyers are in the living room. Serve them drinks, hors d'oeuvres. Use your bodies to please them. I suggest you all do your best. If you\u2019re not bought, you\u2019ll entertain the staff in any way they choose, and then be auctioned off next month.\u201d</p><p>A new owner. Trembling started deep in Kim\u2019s center, and bile rose into her throat. She tried to swallow, but her collar seemed to tighten, choking off her breath, choking off her life. Forcing a slow inhalation, she kept her hands still. Don\u2019t try to rip it off. A scar ran up her neck from the first collar she\u2019d cut off, slicing herself in the process.</p> <p>Lord Greville had beaten her until she\u2019d vomited from the nightmarish pain. As her hands had smudged the blood on the concrete, she\u2019d futilely wished her knife had sliced deeper\u2014an artery and not merely her skin.</p><p>Endure. Be silent . She tightened her stomach muscles and made herself into a statue. The Overseer\u2019s boots remained in her vision for another moment before he walked out of the kitchen and into the living room.</p><p>The sound of his footsteps had faded completely before Kim dared look up. She could keep her face from betraying her, but not her eyes. Any slaver seeing the hatred in her eyes would beat her.</p><p>\u201cBuyers,\u201d Holly whimpered.</p><p>Kim reached over to squeeze the nineteen-year-old blonde\u2019s hand. \u201cShhh. It\u2019ll be fine. Maybe there\u2019s a nice one here tonight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you think so?\u201d Hope filled Holly\u2019s sweet face.</p><p>\u201cWho knows?\u201d</p><p>The third slave in the kitchen took Holly\u2019s other hand. \u201cBe strong, honey. We\u2019ll get through this.\u201d She shook her head at Kim, disapproving of giving the younger woman false expectations. They both knew nice men didn\u2019t buy kidnapped women.</p><p>Kim only wanted to be purchased, to get away from the Overseer. After that, somehow\u2014 somehow she\u2019d get free. She remembered for an instant the surge of the ocean under her boat, the scent and taste of a briny breeze, the camaraderie of the other Georgia biologists. Keep those memories, but bury them deep, where whips can\u2019t reach. She\u2019d get home again. Somehow. Maybe tonight. Any change in routine presented opportunity for escape, especially during transportation. She\u2019d learned the hard way chances decreased once a buyer got her home. Slaves were put into closets or basements when the masters weren\u2019t using them. A shiver ran over her skin. Or cages.</p><p>She swallowed. Her defiance had broken against the heavy steel of the dog-sized cage. On hands and knees, unable to stand, to move. Pissing down her legs. Panicking and screaming until her voice gave out.</p><p>Her master hadn\u2019t liked it when she\u2019d tried to kill him.</p> <p>And did you learn anything from your experience, Kim? her inner cynic asked. She scowled. Next time, I\u2019ll stab him faster. Yet she knew in her gut that she\u2019d never have the courage again.</p><p>With a sigh, she rose and hauled Holly and Linda up beside her. \u201cWell, ladies, let\u2019s go entice some buyers.\u201d</p><p>Silently, she led the way into the formal parlor. She studied the two men conversing quietly by the fire. One was overweight, thirties, with a cruel twist to his fat lips. The other was gaunt and older. Which would be more careless?</p><p>The third buyer... Across the room, a man stood in the hall doorway. Only around six feet, but so muscular, he appeared huge. His white silky shirt set off his dark tan and even darker eyes. Expressionless face, unreadable gaze. He studied Linda and Holly before turning his attention to her, and his impersonal regard blew like a winter wind across her naked skin.</p><p>She shivered. Not him. Please, God, not him. I\u2019m ugly. Clumsy. Bad slave. You don\u2019t want to buy me.</p><p>Standing in the doorway, Raoul Sandoval breathed in the humid Florida air coming from an open window. The dark Victorian parlor with regal blue floral wallpaper and Oriental carpets seemed an appropriate setting for masters and slaves. The other unnamed buyers occupied tapestry-covered chairs. He gave each an indifferent nod, catching sight of himself in the ornate mirror over the fireplace\u2014tailored slacks and silk shirt, his black hair shortened to collar-length and styled. He looked more like his sleek friend Z than himself, but that was the point. He needed to appear rich enough to buy a slave girl. And not a third-world female with broken English, but a well-educated, well-brought-up woman from the US. Only the finest slaves for the richest men.</p><p>Across the room, a dark wood buffet held an array of liquor bottles where three slave girls made drinks, supervised by the tall, pale man labeled the Overseer. \u201cCall me Dahmer,\u201d he\u2019d said, and Raoul had to wonder what kind of psychopath named himself after a serial killer. He appeared average enough. In fair shape, straight brown hair starting to thin, narrow-set eyes the color of mud. A long upper lip with a dent, mouth with a cynical twist. Not the appearance of a person who kidnapped and sold people like cattle.</p><p>Taking his time, Raoul checked out the women. A terrified young blonde; a tall, lush redhead; and a pretty, black-haired female who quickly dropped her gaze. All were dressed in matching silk skirts and nothing else.</p> <p>\u201cAny preferences, gentlemen?\u201d Dahmer asked. He handed the blonde a drink and nodded toward Raoul.</p><p>The short, overweight buyer pointed. \u201cThat one\u2019s on the old side, but I like redheads. For some reason, they\u2019re more fun to fuck.\u201d</p><p>When the redhead paled, Raoul had to tighten his control over his emotions.</p><p>The balding older man barked a laugh and leered at the youngest woman. \u201cI prefer blondes.\u201d</p><p>The little blonde startled, her arm jerking.</p><p>Raoul caught the glass of wine before it spilled on him. \u201cEasy, chica,\u201d he said.</p><p>She cringed, obviously expecting a blow. Anger spiked inside him. Keeping his expression calm, he took a sip of the drink.</p><p>His nod of approval cleared the worry from her face...until the Overseer directed her toward the old man. Her expression of dismay showed clearly.</p><p>The remaining slave had more control. She stood beside Dahmer, eyes down, hands clasped in front. He wouldn\u2019t call her beautiful, but she was pretty enough to please any man. Her skin held a bronze-red tone a few shades lighter than Raoul\u2019s, perhaps from some Native American in her ancestry. Her high breasts sagged slightly, her cheeks were hollowed, and she was slim to the point of being gaunt. She\u2019d obviously lost weight in captivity.</p><p>The Overseer nodded at Raoul. \u201cWill this one be adequate for now, Master R? Of course, switching around is easy enough, or if none pleases you, then simply enjoy the evening, and we\u2019ll arrange another selection at a later date.\u201d</p><p>That was the plan. Refuse them all and score an invitation to the big auction. Where there would be more kidnapped women. Where the FBI could net the entire bunch of bastards. Don\u2019t think about the future. Buyer. You\u2019re a buyer, Sandoval. He strolled across the room to stand in front of the unchosen woman. She kept her gaze on the floor. \u201cTurn,\u201d he ordered, keeping his voice clipped and rough to hide his pity.</p><p>She rotated in place. Long hair so dark as to be almost black hung in waves to the hollow of her back. Under the blue-tinted skirt, her hips curved outward in a pleasing manner.</p><p>\u201cSkinny.\u201d He glanced at Dahmer.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Dahmer said in his slimy voice, \u201cThe slave got herself hurt. She\u2019s fine now but hasn\u2019t regained the pounds she lost. She hasn\u2019t had much training, and she bears some scars, which is why we\u2019re offering her at a bargain price.\u201d</p><p>The tiny muscles around the woman\u2019s mouth barely tightened, but no other reaction showed. Very good control.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll do. For now,\u201d Raoul said. The two FBI agents running the show had recommended he present an aloof personality.</p><p>Raoul threaded his hand in the girl\u2019s black hair, the weight like heavy silk, and used it to pull her closer.</p><p>She didn\u2019t fight him, silently compliant.</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d When she didn\u2019t obey, he tightened his grip and pulled her head back...gently, although it hopefully appeared cruel.</p><p>Her gaze lifted to his, and he froze for a long breath. Startling clear blue eyes, the color of antique glass. He\u2019d seen those eyes before...when Marcus\u2019s submissive had shown him a picture and begged for him to watch for her friend. This had to be Kimberly.</p><p>Madre de Dios, what a fucking mess. \u201cThe coloring is an asset,\u201d he said to the Overseer, then opened his hand and released the...slave. Not Kimberly. For tonight, she was nothing more than a slave, there to serve him. He had no other choice. \u201cBring me something to eat,\u201d he snapped and walked over to sit with the others by the fire.</p><p>Stretching his legs out, he sipped his wine and idly watched the old fart fondle the young girl\u2019s breasts. Rage simmered in an ugly stew in his guts. No, Sandoval. Control. Perhaps someday he could feed the lecher a knuckle sandwich, but not today. Raoul forced his fist to open.</p><p>Thankfully, the black-haired slave appeared and knelt at Raoul\u2019s side, holding up a plate of tidbits. Her submissive silence reminded him of his first slave, but Antonia had served him in love and joy. There was no comparison to this abused woman. \u201cVery nice,\u201d he murmured to her, startling an upward glance from those beautiful eyes. And a hint\u2014only a hint\u2014of pleasure before it was drowned in fear and control. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He selected a cheese-stuffed mushroom, appreciating the effort someone had put into making the food, although it tasted like straw right now. He ate another, then held a piece of melon in front of the slave\u2019s mouth. \u201cEat, chica.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes lowered, but not before he spotted the icy flash. She took the morsel, her soft lips grazing his fingers. He fed her several more, alternating with his own meal, then held his fingers for her to lick clean. He noted the pause before she obeyed. Although she subdued her body language skillfully, the tiny muscles around the eyes and mouth were difficult to control, and her eyes were an open window to her emotions. He could see she\u2019d hated taking food from his hand. Hated him.</p><p>He needed to get with the program. \u201cBehave as if you\u2019re interviewing her for a job,\u201d Special Agent Kouros had coached, obviously doubtful Raoul could manage.</p><p>\u201cWhat talents do you possess?\u201d Raoul asked, taking the plate and setting it on the end table.</p> <p>She shifted her weight on her knees. \u201cI don\u2019t have any skills, Master,\u201d she murmured, almost inaudibly, as if she didn\u2019t want the Overseer to hear.</p><p>No talents? Doubtful. Perhaps she hoped he wouldn\u2019t buy her? Was it him she disliked or all the buyers? Did she hope to remain here? \u201cWhat happens if you\u2019re not bought tonight?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t control her flinch. So her aim wasn\u2019t to remain with the Overseer. She preferred one of the other two buyers? Raoul glanced over. Perhaps she hoped she might escape more easily from a fat or an old master? Clever girl.</p><p>But both buyers were sadists. Not good. And he could tell from her flinch, something bad happened to girls who didn\u2019t get sold.</p><p>How could he leave this young woman here to suffer? Gabi\u2019s friend. He couldn\u2019t.</p> <p>Some of the foul taste left his mouth. At least he could save one girl. The agents would go ballistic, but they\u2019d find an alternative plan.</p><p>And if they couldn\u2019t?</p><p>He rubbed his hand over his mouth. In buying Kimberly, he might doom the others. His gut tightened. There were no easy solutions to this nightmare.</p><p>\u201cCan you cook?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, Master R.\u201d</p><p>Not going to expand on the answer, was she? He chuckled. \u201cMust I drag the information from you?\u201d</p> <p>She went white with fear. \u201cNo, Master. I\u2019m sorry, Master.\u201d</p><p>His anger at the slavers rose so hard and hot that his hands clamped on the chair arms. He forced himself to lean back. \u201cBring me a fresh drink.\u201d And let me get past wanting to strangle every bastard in this place. He damn well wanted this evening over with, but no chance of that. No buyer would spend this much money without a test-drive first, and if he offered for the girl too soon, Dahmer would make him for a fraud. Play the part, Sandoval. Even if you terrify her.</p><p>She returned, knelt silently, and held the glass up.</p><p>As he sipped his drink, he studied her, learning how she breathed, how she shifted her weight as her anxiety grew. In her late twenties or early thirties. Average height, skin slack rather than taut, so she was normally rounder. Softer. Her nipples a pinkish brown and large. A long, almost-healed red scar wound along her left rib cage, reminding him of his gang-member days. Knife scar.</p><p>Tracing a finger over her scarred remnant of violence, he saw the momentary vulnerable quiver of her lips before her mouth flattened. Gabi had described her friend as exuberant, and he could see lines of past laughter bracketing her mouth and veeing out from the corners of her eyes.</p><p>She was joyful no longer. Grief at the loss was a smudge on his soul.</p><p>\u201cShe dances, you know,\u201d the Overseer said, stopping at Raoul\u2019s chair. \u201cIntelligent. An excellent cook. Not a particularly good singing voice, but you forget that when she dances.\u201d</p><p>Raoul glanced down at her. \u201cDance for me then, slave. Something seductive.\u201d</p> <p>She rose gracefully. As she hurried away, he noticed whip scars on her back. \u201cTell me more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA marine biologist from Georgia, middle-class background. Healthy, single, no children. A lightweight in the lifestyle before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhip marks. A recent knife cut. Was she sold before?\u201d Raoul asked.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Dahmer cleared his throat, smoothed his black suit. \u201cShe was picked up for the \u2018rebellious slave\u2019 auction.\u201d</p><p>Raoul raised his eyebrows as if confused, although he knew exactly what Dahmer was talking about. His best friend\u2019s submissive, Gabi, had been one of those kidnapped to be sold.</p><p>\u201cAh, each sale event has a theme. The last one featured feisty slaves with prior BDSM experience. Sassy. Bratty. Designed to give a master a challenge. I\u2019m afraid she didn\u2019t live up to her promise. The owner was displeased and requested a refund.\u201d</p><p>The buyer had obviously taken his displeasure out on Kimberly. \u201cSo she\u2019s used merchandise. What\u2019s wrong with the other two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe blonde is...awkward. She would do well in a comfortable environment, but she exhibits poorly.\u201d The Overseer turned, and the young woman cringed at his frown. \u201cThe redhead is older. She wasn\u2019t on our list, but since she witnessed a pickup being made, the deliveryman Tasered her and brought her along as well. She has a few sellable talents, but her age puts her in a lower price range.\u201d</p><p>The bargain basement for slaves. Exactly as advertised. Since he hadn\u2019t known if the slavers investigated a buyer\u2019s financial status, Raoul hadn\u2019t tried to fake extreme wealth. Instead during the interview, he\u2019d asked about lower-priced slaves, figuring it would consolidate his story.</p><p>\u201cWell, Blackie has possibilities,\u201d Raoul said.</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d Satisfaction oozed from Dahmer\u2019s voice. \u201cBut test her out thoroughly this evening. We\u2019ve found that buyers make better choices and are more satisfied if they take their time and put the merchandise through their paces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakes sense.\u201d He thought about playing with a nonwilling participant, and his gut tightened.</p><p>Raoul looked up as Kimberly reentered the room, now covered in veils. \u201cWell...\u201d he let himself say with an appreciative murmur.</p><p>Dahmer laughed. \u201cShe belonged to a modern dance group that put on shows for charity. I had an experienced slave give her lessons in erotic dancing and... You\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>The music started.</p><p>Concentrating only on the Middle Eastern music, Kim walked in a slow circle as the chiffon material trailed behind her. The other veils covering her body fluttered delicately against her skin. Barefoot, she turned slowly, presented a hip, rotated, letting her hair swing. Slow turns. Arms moving to emphasize her body\u2019s curves. She let the scarf in her hand float away and replaced it with the one covering her face.</p><p>Knowing her stamina was poor, she\u2019d chosen a short tune. To heck with Hollywood\u2019s Dance of the Seven Veils\u2014she was doing four, and that was that.</p><p>As the beat picked up, she began the undulating movements, ignoring the painful pulling of the barely healed muscles over her ribs. She concentrated on the dance, trying to ignore the men watching. All of them. The Overseer\u2019s face had flushed with lust, and she concealed a shudder. Music. Think of the music.</p><p>One more veil and her breasts were bare. She shimmied as her teacher had taught. The middle-aged buyer swallowed and leaned forward. She turned her gaze away. Her body wanted to dance; her soul needed to flee. Her brain knew better and took control, forcing her feet closer to the darkly tanned buyer. Eyes down, she managed to smile appealingly and not grimace. Another spin. Move closer.</p><p>She lifted her head finally. Her eyes met his, and he trapped her gaze as tightly as he\u2019d gripped her hair earlier. Yet his look was warm, so warm, and when he released her, he seemed to have taken off all the chains binding her muscles.</p><p>The music poured around her, rocking her in its embrace. She floated through the dance, the beat of the dumbek ruling her hips, the song of the mizmar moving her arms and shoulders. Each foot came down exactly right, the feeling indescribable.</p><p>Removing the last veil bared her completely, but the sound increased, pulling her after until it slowed and stopped.</p><p>She realized she\u2019d knelt in front of Master R instead of in the center of the room. As if he\u2019d keep her safe from the others. The murmur of conversation came from the other two buyers and the Overseer.</p><p>Her chest heaved as she tried to catch her breath. Out of shape. She hadn\u2019t danced since before Lord Greville had... Since before. A film of moisture dampened her body, and the breeze was cool against her skin. Naked. She hated the feeling of being unclothed in front of men. Why hadn\u2019t it seemed a problem in the clubs she\u2019d visited in the past?</p><p>Because it had been her choice then. And she\u2019d stripped to please and arouse whoever she was playing with. Right now, the thought of arousing anyone wasn\u2019t at all appealing. Yet if she didn\u2019t, the consequences...</p><p>She\u2019d still been recovering during the last private sale\u2014thank you, God\u2014but after the buyers had left, one slave had remained, unwanted and unsold. The Overseer had given her to the staff. The woman\u2019s shrill screams had eventually died, sometime late in the night, and the next day, she\u2019d returned to the locked room. Not a person anymore; nothing lived behind her blank eyes. The Overseer had fined his staff a week\u2019s wages for ruining the merchandise. And the slave had...disappeared. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kim swallowed hard.</p><p>Sure fingers cupped her chin, lifting her face. The brown eyes that had been so cold at first now held the desire she wasn\u2019t sure she wanted...and something else. Concern? \u201cWhat is wrong, chiquita?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>The question, the gentleness brought tears to her eyes. She tried to pull back, but his fingers tightened, keeping her face exposed to his scrutiny. To her horror, she realized she was close to crying. No. \u201cPlease. Don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>His frown grew. Then he released her and looked away. When he turned back, his eyes were remote, his face like stone, chilling her inside as well as outside. For a moment, he\u2019d almost seemed human.</p> <p>Haven\u2019t you learned anything, Kim? You really are a dumb slut like Lord Greville said.</p><p>\u201cGentlemen, if you are ready, the dungeon is waiting,\u201d the Overseer announced.</p><p>The fat one made a pleased sound, face filling with lust.</p><p>The older one snapped, \u201cAbout time.\u201d He rose and grabbed Holly by her hair, dragging her behind him. She was half-bent over. Crying.</p><p>Kim\u2019s wish to kill the cruel man almost...almost outweighed her common sense. But she\u2019d learned. Painfully. Interfering meant the slavers would beat her\u2014and the woman she tried to help as well. The short whip slicing across her back, then the shocking explosion of pain. The screaming of the other slave. Her hands flattened on her thighs. Don\u2019t speak; don\u2019t look.</p> <p>Master R rose. \u201cCome.\u201d</p><p>She started to gather her discarded garments, and he shook his head. \u201cYou are dressed appropriately for the dungeon.\u201d</p><p>When she was on her feet, he grasped her by the back of her neck, his grip firm but not painful, his fingers calloused. Pushing her in front of him, he followed the others to the dungeon, a converted living area with hardwood floors, chains dangling from the rafters, a couple of St. Andrew\u2019s crosses, sawhorse benches, a bondage table. Implements hung on the dark paneled walls between the bloodred drapes covering the windows. Even in silence, the dimly lit room seemed to echo with the sounds of pain.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and put your prospective slaves through their paces,\u201d the Overseer announced. \u201cSince you have provided medical papers, no condoms are necessary. All three women have birth control implants and are certified disease-free. I remind you not to inflict permanent damage, but anything that\u2019ll heal in a few days is fine: welts, stripes, bruises.\u201d</p><p>The pudgy one headed for the St. Andrew\u2019s cross on the right wall, picking up a single-tail on the way. The older man shoved Holly to her knees beside him as he examined the rack of canes.</p><p>Kim\u2019s stomach tightened as she remembered her words earlier. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s a nice one out there.\u201d There were no nice ones in this world. Oh Holly, I\u2019m sorry, honey.</p> <p>\u201cAnd you, sir?\u201d The Overseer turned to Master R. \u201cI heard you enjoy dispensing a good beating.\u201d</p><p>The hand gripping her neck flexed slightly. \u201cI\u2019ll use a flogger.\u201d</p><p>Staring at the floor, Kim breathed out, trying to tell herself a flogger wasn\u2019t as bad as other stuff. Like a whip. Or a cane. Unless he picked one of the nastier kinds. Her nerves were jumping with her need to yank away and run, but she wouldn\u2019t even get out of the room. And then she\u2019d pay and pay and pay. I can endure this. It\u2019s only pain.</p><p>Somehow she could feel the buyer\u2019s attention on her like a warm breeze. His thumb stroked the side of her neck. \u201cDahmer, you\u2019ve got a pretty setup here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d the Overseer said, his voice with that slick, sharp edge to it. \u201cAlthough pulling everything down and setting up in a new house becomes tedious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can imagine. How long have you been in this...line of work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Harvest Association hired me about seven years ago.\u201d The Overseer\u2019s laugh made Kim\u2019s skin crawl. \u201cThe side benefits are great\u2014like training the merchandise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI daresay. Do you choose the women?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOur watchers select potential slaves according to what we\u2019re looking for at the time.\u201d The Overseer nodded to Holly. \u201cThat one was picked up for our annual \u2018Blondes are more fun\u2019 auction. In the Southeast quadrant, I select from the list and contract the appropriate people to make the pickups.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite a few layers in your group. That\u2019s reassuring.\u201d</p><p>Layers upon layers. Drown the bastards and let crabs eat their bodies. Kim bit her tongue until she tasted blood. Early on, the Overseer had explained how long the Association had been in business, and the impossibility of their families ever finding them. One despairing slave had tried to commit suicide that night, but the torn plastic cup couldn\u2019t cut her skin deep enough.</p><p>\u201cThe safety and anonymity of the association and our buyers is our primary concern.\u201d The Overseer stopped. Kim glanced up to see him gesture toward the floggers on the back wall. \u201cI think you\u2019ll find something there that fits your needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much time do we have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong as you want.\u201d The Overseer\u2019s eyes met Kim\u2019s. \u201cAccording to her last owner, this piece of goods doesn\u2019t break down quickly.\u201d</p><p>Her skin went cold; her hands started to tremble. Lord Greville had never stopped until she\u2019d broken, and then he\u2019d...</p><p>Master R snorted and pulled her back against his body, his arm around her waist, one wide palm covering her breast. \u201cAny ham-handed idiot can make a woman scream. I prefer to assess...responsiveness.\u201d His powerful hand caressed her, his touch light. Not somehow repugnant, but still...touching her, as a reminder that her body was no longer her own. She tried to move, but the iron band of his arm held her easily in place.</p><p>The Overseer tipped his head. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to have an experienced dominant.\u201d</p><p>As if he\u2019d recognize experience if it bit him on the butt, Kim thought, but Master R was a dom. She could tell. As the Overseer left at a hail from the fat buyer, Master R turned her around. His face held no expression she could read, and a tremor ran through her. What was he planning to do?</p><p>Did she want to try to get him to buy her or not? He hadn\u2019t been cruel\u2014not in the way the other two buyers displayed. Her stomach sank when she saw Holly restrained on a bench, enduring the slash of the cane, whimpering with each blow.</p><p>On the St. Andrew\u2019s cross, Linda was silent, but tears streamed down her face as the whip left red stripes on her breasts and stomach. The older woman had admitted she was a masochist\u2014actually liked pain\u2014but not like this. Never like this.</p><p>Kim didn\u2019t want either of those sadists, yet this man was...observant. Too smart to get away from. She flinched as Holly\u2019s buyer changed to a leather strap, the sound loud in the room. Should she chance the cruelty in hopes of escape? How badly would she be damaged before she could get free?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking too much, little slave. Keep your eyes only on me.\u201d</p><p>Her attention jerked back to him at the soft command. His veil of remoteness had dropped away again. Folding his arms over his chest, he studied her, his dark gaze skimming over her face, her shoulders, her hands, her legs. Under the discomfort of the heavy silence, she shifted her weight as the flutters in her stomach increased. An experienced dominant. She saw the signs in his posture and in the way that sometimes she reacted to him as a dom\u2014not a monster.</p><p>He\u2019s a monster. Never forget that.</p><p>\u201cWhat is your real name?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>My name. Part of me. Not answering this. His chin lifted and under his gaze, her defiance that had infuriated Lord Greville bent as inevitably as a palm tree in a tropical storm. \u201cKimberly. Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d When his face softened in approval, her muscles relaxed even though she knew\u2014she knew\u2014he was a slaver. And he\u2014he wanted to use a flogger on her.</p><p>He grasped her shoulders and turned her so her back was to him. Why wasn\u2019t he being rough with her? As he traced lines down her back, his fingers were warm, the calluses scraping lightly. \u201cYou\u2019ve been whipped. Was it before or after your slavery?\u201d</p><p>Her throat went tight. Slavery. Why did hearing the word send disbelief through her every time? This can\u2019t be me. Can\u2019t be happening. \u201cAfter.\u201d Lord Greville\u2019s eyes, crazy mad, the pain, falling to her knees, blood everywhere.</p><p>He grunted. \u201cAssholes.\u201d</p><p>What? She forced herself to stillness.</p><p>\u201cYou are not going to escape this evening without some pain, chiquita.\u201d Even as she stiffened, he pulled her back against him again, his body like a brick wall, his arm circling her waist. He fondled her breasts, his gentleness disconcerting. His breath teased the curls at her temple. \u201cDid you enjoy being flogged before all this happened?\u201d</p><p>That was a different life, no relation to the one now.</p><p>\u201cKimberly?\u201d</p><p>She should never have told him her name\u2014hearing it now, used in a master\u2019s authoritative voice, shook something inside her. My name. I\u2019m real. I\u2019m still me, Kimberly Elizabeth Moore. She swallowed, remembered the question about BDSM clubs and play parties. Before. \u201cI\u2014yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d His resonant voice relaxed her, even as she tried to keep herself defended. \u201cAnd restraints? Do they bother you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This seemed like before somehow, the dance of negotiations, while finding a partner who liked what she did. But it isn\u2019t, Kim. You\u2019re a slave. A fuckhole. A slut. She stiffened.</p><p>He nipped her earlobe, making her jump and raising the oddest tingle inside her. \u201cStay in the present with me, Kimberly,\u201d he said, his voice so very different than earlier. Low and rich and smooth with a hint of a Spanish accent. As unexpectedly warm as a sunny day in the spring. \u201cAnswer me now. Do restraints bother you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not really.\u201d Not like enclosed spaces, hoods, cages. Her stomach turned over, and her chest constricted.</p><p>\u201cSomething bothers you. What?\u201d</p><p>As if she\u2019d give him a weapon to use against her. To punish her with like the Overseer had. Her mouth compressed into a thin line.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d He sighed and turned her to face him. As he regarded her, he massaged her upper arms, his grip powerful, controlled...warm. \u201cI am going to restrain you and flog you. I will use my hands on you, perhaps my mouth. I know you don\u2019t have a choice in this\u201d\u2014his eyes chilled for a moment\u2014\u201cbut you might find it easier, knowing I won\u2019t exceed those boundaries.\u201d</p><p>He\u2014he was right. He planned nothing she hadn\u2019t enjoyed at one time\u2014nothing she hadn\u2019t survived since. No cages. The relief blanked her mind, and a thank-you escaped before she could pull it back.</p><p>One corner of his mouth tipped up. \u201cI like hearing gratitude.\u201d He ran his knuckles over her left breast. As always, since soon after her capture, she felt nothing. No pain, no revulsion, just...nothing.</p><p>His eyes narrowed. He stroked over her breast again slowly, this time studying her face as he did. Without lifting his hand, he stroked upward and over her shoulder. Her neck.</p><p>The skin on his fingertips was a little rough. His palm melted the ice under her skin the way the heat from the sun would dissipate morning fog on the water.</p><p>\u201cYou will need much work, chiquita,\u201d he murmured, \u201cbut this is not the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Shocked that the word had escaped her, she took a hasty step away, tensing in preparation for his blow.</p><p>Ignoring her mistake, he jerked his chin at the rack of restraints. \u201cPick out comfortable wrist and ankle cuffs, then return to me.\u201d</p><p>She hurried, relief making her knees wobbly. He hadn\u2019t hit her for speaking without permission. Either time. But what had he meant by work to do? She shook her head and concentrated on doing as he ordered.</p><p>Once the cuffs were on, she returned.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cHands laced behind your neck. Open your legs farther. Eyes on me.\u201d</p><p>She followed his orders, spreading her feet apart slightly wider than her shoulder. Other slaves had been taught this position, she knew. Her experience had been...other. The restricted sensation from the cuffs started her stomach roiling.</p><p>\u201cVery nice.\u201d He checked the fit of her cuffs. To her surprise, he loosened one overly snug ankle cuff.</p><p>He eyed her for a moment. \u201cYou\u2019re a lovely woman, Kimberly.\u201d He strolled around her, inspecting her, and somehow, perhaps because of his light touch, she didn\u2019t feel the usual nausea and fury. He explored the marks on her back where Lord Greville and his staff had whipped her bloody, then the bruising on her hips from when the Overseer... Her mind winced away.</p><p>Again his finger ran over the knife scar, giving her the odd sensation of tingling and numbness from damaged nerves. He frowned at the purple bruising on her foot left by the Overseer\u2019s boot from when she\u2019d spilled a drop of his coffee.</p><p>After running his hands over her hips, he touched her pussy. Bare. Smooth. She\u2019d become adept at shaving in the past weeks. She felt the stroke of his hand, but it brought nothing but memories of other hands and cocks.</p><p>\u201cPobrecita,\u201d he said under his breath and looked her straight in the eyes. \u201cI am going to check you more closely, Kimberly. I need to know if there are any problems.\u201d</p><p>More closely? Understanding hit in a dizzying wave when he moved to the table and squirted lubricant over his fingers. Oh God. She closed her eyes and simply waited. Don\u2019t tense. I\u2019m not here. It\u2019s a good day to visit the beach. Grains of sand under my feet, the ocean breeze...</p> <p>To her surprise, she felt only the heat of his body, the brush of his silky shirt against her breasts, his breath on her cheek. \u201cLook at me,\u201d he said, ever so softly.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to. She raised her gaze. His face was close to hers, his dark brown eyes filled with such understanding she almost whimpered.</p><p>His hand cupped her mound.</p><p>No. She turned her head, only to have him give a warning sound from low in his throat. He\u2019d given her an order. Expected her to obey.</p><p>She raised her eyes to his.</p><p>His lubricated fingers slid over her in a way she hadn\u2019t felt in a long time. He watched her silently as his fingers touched her clit, then separated her labia. He pressed one finger inside her, and she couldn\u2019t help the instinctive cringing away.</p><p>\u201cShhh, chiquita.\u201d His other hand cupped her bottom, holding her in place. He kissed her lightly as if to reassure her, then slid a second finger into her, pressing upward. She tried to close her thighs and realized his feet were inside hers, keeping her legs open. After a moment, he slid his fingers out.</p><p>Not done, though. He stepped back and took a latex glove from the box.</p><p>I hate this. Hate you. Hate you all.</p><p>\u201cBend over and spread your cheeks, girl.\u201d His voice was cold. Cruel.</p><p>She blinked at the change, then noticed the Overseer approaching. Did the dom\u2019s manner change to chilly because of the Overseer? The thought was...</p><p>\u201cNow, girl.\u201d</p><p>Her mind blanked as her body tensed. He\u2019d touch her...there. Gritting her teeth, she bent, arching her bottom up and opening herself for his inspection.</p><p>A lubricated finger circled her rim. \u201cShe has been taken anally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes. Unless a buyer requests an anal virgin, we feel it best to have each slave prepared.\u201d</p><p>The dom\u2019s thick finger pressed against her anus. She wanted to escape, and as if he could tell, he gripped her hip in warning. Then his finger breached the ring of muscle, sliding inside her. In and out before the shudder had even left her body.</p><p>\u201cMmm. Not bad.\u201d He moved away to toss the glove into the waste. \u201cI\u2019d probably have to train with a wider plug to keep from tearing her up, though.\u201d</p><p>The thought made her cringe, and anger rose to replace the fear. As if he was that big. But a quick glance at his slacks indicated he told the truth. He could hurt her. Badly.</p><p>Grasping her nape again, he guided to where chains hung from the ceiling, between the ones attached to bolts in the floor. He put her into an upright, spread-eagle position, legs restrained widely apart, then tightened the chains on her arms, ensuring she couldn\u2019t move.</p><p>She closed her eyes, trying to get to the place where it wouldn\u2019t hurt as much. Not subspace...hardly that. This pain she\u2019d simply endure, going as far away as she could. The boat pushed off from shore, waves splashing on the sides, wind whipping her hair...</p><p>After a brief survey of the wall, he chose a flogger and a cat-o\u2019-nine-tails and returned. To her dismay, he ran his hands over her shoulders, her arms, her torso, her legs. Bringing her back to the now, damn him. His palms were rough, his fingernails cut short.</p><p>Her body warmed under his touch. Her skin did; her core stayed icy. He repeated the process, rubbing the strands of the flogger over her. He\u2019d chosen medium weight, deerskin leather, not one with knotted strands, thank God.</p><p>He flicked the ends, and they pattered against her back like fat raindrops. She jumped, then relaxed as the rain of the flogger continued, even and smooth. Almost comforting.</p><p>He moved to her front, hitting her lightly. \u201cWhere are you from, Kimberly?\u201d</p><p>Doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m in hell now. She stared over his shoulder at the wall of whips and floggers.</p><p>\u201cKimberly?\u201d he repeated in a deeper voice.</p><p>Her words stuttered out as if dredged from the ocean depths. \u201cI...from Atlanta.\u201d No, that was wrong. Mom\u2019s in Atlanta. Why do I feel so lost? \u201cI work in\u2014\u201dSavannah. The strands hit her breasts, and she jumped, feeling something unwelcome bloom inside her, something more than pain.</p><p>\u201cYou do have a little bit of a Southern accent.\u201d He stopped and studied her for a minute. His eyes... How did he make them change from gut-chillingly mean to snuggly kind? He stepped forward, again close enough for her to feel the heat he radiated, and then stroked a hand down her hair. \u201cLittle slave, I\u2019m going to ask you a question. Whatever you answer, there will be no judgment or anger on my part. I simply need to know how you want this to go.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. Why did he keep wanting to talk? But she could answer a question\u2014as if she had a choice. She nodded.</p><p>\u201cBueno.\u201d He hesitated a moment, as if searching for words. \u201cI think I can make you respond.\u201d He curved his hand over her cheek and brushed her lower lip with his thumb. \u201cMake you enjoy the flogging. Make you come. Or I can simply flog you until you scream in pain. I... That is not my way.\u201d His eyes darkened, his jaw tight with anger\u2014but not at her, somehow she knew. \u201cYou have had much taken away. To be forced to respond might be more damaging than enduring the pain. So I will let the choice be yours. Which would you prefer?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She hadn\u2019t had an orgasm since her capture, but his touch and the authority he wore so comfortably yet used in an almost...caring...way were drawing her. A prisoner effect, undoubtedly, to cling to the one man who treats you like a person. As he waited, so horribly confident in his skills, she had the gut-twisting suspicion he could make her come. Here. Make her reveal her inmost self in front of the slavers. The Overseer. She shook her head and whispered, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo to what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me... Just hurt me, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want an orgasm. You\u2019d rather have the pain.\u201d He waited for her nod of confirmation, and his mouth twisted as if he tasted something foul. \u201cThen I will ask this of you. When it truly hurts, please scream. It\u2019ll get us both out of here sooner.\u201d</p> <p>No. She wouldn\u2019t make a sound. Begging, screaming, whimpering was admitting defeat. With each beating, she hung on until the pain overwhelmed her and flattened her mind into pure instinct. Now he ordered her to give in early?</p><p>The little piece of her that was still Kimberly said no. Never.</p><p>Yet he\u2019d given her this choice, tried to make this easier for her.</p><p>Or was his kindness a trick?</p><p>She couldn\u2019t keep her own arguments straight. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p> <p>He lifted an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cYes, Master. I\u2019m sorry, Master,\u201d she added so quickly her tongue faltered.</p><p>\u201cVery nice.\u201d His mouth curved before he kissed her again, his lips warm against her cold ones. When he stepped back, his posture altered: Clark Kent to Superman. The concern he\u2019d shown disappeared from his face.</p><p>Why had she revealed so much\u2014told him anything? He\u2019d played her for a fool.</p><p>He moved with controlled power as he shook the flogger out, then disappeared behind her. Blows hit her upper back, on each side of her spine, on her bottom. The tails thudded lightly across her skin in a steady slow rhythm. Then faster.</p><p>All too soon, her back and bottom began to burn. He remained behind her, building up to a thorough flogging.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re damn good at that, Master R,\u201d the Overseer said, his oiled, knifelike voice making her cringe. \u201cBut I\u2019m surprised you\u2019re not fucking her, like the other two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, call me Raoul,\u201d he said, never missing a stroke. Everywhere he hit was starting to really hurt.</p><p>And then he changed his stroke so only the tips struck her skin, and the tapping sensation changed to stinging. Much, much worse. Her hands fisted.</p><p>\u201cI rarely fuck in public,\u201d Master R said. \u201cIf she\u2019s not talented now, she can learn.\u201d His voice sharpened. \u201cRight now, I want to hear what she sounds like when she screams.\u201d</p><p>Through the swirling redness in her brain she caught his slight emphasis on the word. Scream. He\u2019d told her to scream.</p><p>No. Never.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s try the cat.\u201d The blows stopped. Footsteps. A different swishing sound. Her courage fled. A cat-o\u2019-nine-tails. She tried to brace herself.</p><p>It hit, ripping across the skin on her upper back like claws. Left, then right. Oh God! Her</p> <p>jaw clamped shut, not letting the sound out. She stared at the wall, her shoulders on fire, and could almost hear his voice: Do it.</p><p>His next blow was harder. She felt the sting and burn of torn skin. Scream, Kim. Her mouth opened. Nothing came out.</p><p>He struck across her upper buttocks, and this time, as the pain exploded through her, she forced a shriek past her clenched jaw. Another two blows fell, ripping into her body like fire. The wall of silence broken, she sagged and screamed again. A trickle of liquid ran down her back. Her blood.</p><p>He stopped. Oh God, he stopped. Tears rolled down her face, splattering on the floor. Through the ringing in her ears, she heard him say to the Overseer, \u201cQuite a melodic scream. I noticed she serves nicely as well, and that\u2019s important to me. The clumsy blonde would be unacceptable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like a master who knows what he wants. Too many impatient idiots purchase blindly.\u201d The Overseer laughed. \u201cBut it makes for good return business. They break their toys and have to buy a new one.\u201d</p><p>Her knees had buckled, and she hung from her arms, her shoulders aching. Her back felt as if she\u2019d lain on glowing coals. Kim swallowed against the dryness in her mouth. She\u2019d been broken once\u2014and found herself again. She didn\u2019t think she could survive another.</p><p>\u201cNice even marks,\u201d the Overseer said, his voice much, much closer than she wanted. The chains kept her from moving as he stood right behind her. A finger ran down her spine, and it felt as if a trail of slime followed his touch. Get away. Don\u2019t touch me.</p><p>\u201cI hit what I aim at.\u201d Master R walked in front of her, tilted her head up, and inspected her coldly.</p><p>Raoul could feel the little slave\u2019s pain\u2014pain he\u2019d given with no pleasure, no emotional satisfaction. Guilt shot through him, and the desire to maim Dahmer was so strong he couldn\u2019t move. One slow breath. He controlled his rage, sent it deep into his foundations, and stepped away from the girl.</p><p>\u201cI like your professionalism,\u201d Dahmer said. \u201cAre you still interested in auditioning to do a demonstration at one of auctions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly.\u201d Could he still get into an auction? Maybe buying Kimberly wouldn\u2019t ruin the FBI\u2019s plans after all. Raoul tossed the cat with the cruelly knotted falls on a bench and forced a grin. \u201cI\u2019d like to attend one for the fun of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid the events are open only to active buyers and performers.\u201d Dahmer cleared his throat politely. \u201cAnd you indicated your funds were limited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. I won\u2019t be up to buying another slave for a while. But I could certainly do a demonstration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBear in mind, the scenes have to be...carnal...in one way or another.\u201d</p><p>Fuck some poor woman in front of a bunch of perverts? Raoul\u2019s stomach turned over. \u201cOf course. What\u2019s the point otherwise?\u201d</p><p>Dahmer laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s the spirit. There\u2019s a long list of performers waiting already, so I\u2019m not sure when you\u2019d be scheduled. But you could audition during your follow-up visit and get on the list.\u201d</p><p>What the hell? \u201cSounds good, but what follow-up visit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe info is in the paperwork you get when you buy. But basically it\u2019s for our refund policy\u2014and a way to ensure buyers conform to the Harvest Association policies.\u201d The slimy cabr\u00f3n chuckled. \u201cAfter a few weeks, I stop by and watch you with your merchandise. It\u2019s so I can answer any questions that have arisen about training, and if a slave has proven unsatisfactory during the trial period, I remove her then. You get a refund, and we arrange for you to buy a new one.\u201d</p><p>That sounded totally impossible. But no matter now. Raoul frowned at Kimberly, every cell wanting to remove her restraints and care for her. \u201cAll right then. This slave is adequate. Let\u2019s do the paperwork.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Open satisfaction showed in the greedy bastard\u2019s eyes. \u201cI think she\u2019ll do well for you.\u201d</p><p>Raoul glanced back at Kimberly, saw blood drip onto the floor, and covered his wince with a cold jerk of his head. \u201cHave someone hose her off and dress her, please.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Raoul cradled Kimberly in his arms, watching the slaver\u2019s van pull away from his home, its headlights illuminating the splashing fountain, then the bronze statue of a heron at the end of the drive. He hated them knowing where he lived, his background...anything to do with his life.</p><p>Nonetheless, this was what he\u2019d signed on to do.</p><p>As the sultry night air wrapped around him, he took his first decent breath of the evening. Home. The lights bracketing the front door tried to dispel the night\u2019s darkness but didn\u2019t touch what had lodged in his soul. A long, long time would pass before he\u2019d get over his sense of helplessness and guilt at having to abandon the other two women.</p><p>But he\u2019d saved one. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, chiquita. I\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes opened, hazed with the sedative the Overseer had administered to ensure an uneventful trip. \u201cTake care of myself,\u201d she mumbled yet curled closer into his arms.</p><p>Indomitable spirit\u2014fragile, scarred body. The Feds wouldn\u2019t approve of him choosing emotion over logic, but he\u2019d never have any regrets. Her head lolled against his chest, and his heart squeezed as he carried her into the coolness of his home. His boots thudded on the tile of the small foyer and echoed in the empty house.</p><p>As she slept on the couch in the great room, Raoul texted the number the FBI agents had given him. The message was 1, reporting he\u2019d returned home.</p><p>In the morning, he\u2019d inform them he\u2019d screwed up the operation.</p><p>He tried to call Gabrielle. The thought of telling the sweet submissive that her best friend was freed lightened his heart. But no one answered at the house she shared with her dom, and Marcus didn\u2019t answer his cell phone. Was this the weekend the two planned to go sailing? Growling, he texted them also, telling them to come to his house tomorrow morning.</p><p>Raoul scowled. Apparently he had himself a slave for the night.</p><p>Slave. The word sandpapered his nerves. He rubbed his face. Even after three years, the remnants of the ugly fight with his mother and sister still echoed in his memory. \u201cYou kept a woman as a slave? You\u2019re a monster, Raoul.\u201d His fun-loving sister\u2019s voice had been so cold. Distant, as if she\u2019d already cut him from her life. His mother\u2019s lined face had grown more careworn, and the brown eyes which matched his own had filled with tears as she whispered, \u201cHow could you, my son?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They should meet Dahmer and see what real monsters look like.</p><p>Now what? He frowned at the little slave on his couch. At least she wasn\u2019t really his, even if he was stuck with her longer than he wanted.</p><p>Pretty little slave, somehow both innocent and sensual in the pink sweat pants and tank top the Overseer had provided for her. She slept heavily. Her thick black lashes lay against her pale cheeks, her breathing slow. Even if he managed to wake her, she wouldn\u2019t be capable of understanding any explanations.</p><p>He sighed. His body ached as if he\u2019d been the one to be flogged, and he was exhausted in a way he\u2019d never felt after doing a scene at the Shadowlands. He needed sleep, or he\u2019d be incoherent when Buchanan or Kouros arrived, expecting a detailed report.</p><p>Sleep it was.</p><p>In the upstairs hallway with Kimberly in his arms, he started toward the guest room and then remembered the fury in her eyes. If she woke, she\u2019d try to run, no doubt about it. As much as the thought disgusted him, she\u2019d have to be secured against escape...but he never left a restrained sub unattended.</p><p>He turned and headed for his own room.</p><p>When he laid her down on his bed, her eyes popped open, and she hit at him.</p><p>He caught her small fist. \u201cShhh, Kimberly, no one is going to hurt you here.\u201d</p><p>Even drugged as she was, the twist of her lips showed her disbelief, but she couldn\u2019t maintain her anger. Her eyes slowly drooped, then closed.</p><p>He stroked her hair back from her face, wishing Gabi had been available to take her friend home. Kimberly shouldn\u2019t have to live in fear a moment longer. What a mess.</p><p>No choice. He glanced at the ankle and wrist cuffs she still wore\u2014freebies from the slavers\u2014and ones she\u2019d stay in for tonight. At least the master bedroom was already set up for bondage with chains on the heavy ironwork. He secured the lower bedpost chain to her right ankle cuff. No escape for you, little slave. Not tonight.</p><p>After setting the multitool from his boot sheath and the padlock key the Overseer had given him on the bedside table, he moved them out of Kimberly\u2019s reach.</p><p>His shower didn\u2019t wash away the sensation of filth, but it helped. He rummaged in the dresser for a pair of loose cotton pants and pulled them on. She didn\u2019t wake as he rolled her over and checked her back. The attendants had put bandages over the places where he\u2019d cut her skin and ointment on the welts. Everything looked clean. He\u2019d seen\u2014even done\u2014much worse, but never to someone who wasn\u2019t willing.</p><p>Unhappiness stewing in his chest, he slid under the covers. Propped up on an elbow, he studied her, a little shocked at how different she was from Rachel, the healthy, enthusiastic woman he\u2019d had in his bed last week. Kimberly had dark circles under her eyes, yellowing bruises here and there, and hollowed cheeks that made him want to feed her. Pamper her. But he doubted she\u2019d agree or say two words to him, even after she learned she was safe.</p><p>She\u2019d only remember that he\u2019d flogged her bloody. Guilt stabbed through him again.</p><p>Well, he\u2019d done the best he could. He sighed. Tomorrow wouldn\u2019t be a pleasant day. Special Agents Kouros and Buchanan would be furious. He was to have rejected all the slaves, essentially forcing the Overseer to invite him to the auction. Instead, he\u2019d bought a slave.</p><p>One who had a wealth of anger simmering in her soul. One who undoubtedly hated the buyer who\u2019d lashed her. He might wake to a fist in the face.</p><p>Better safe than sorry, he decided, and pulled her against his chest so he\u2019d know if she moved. Her body was just the right size to fit within the curve of his, and when he slid his arm under her head for a pillow, her soft ass pressed on his groin. Ignoring the way he hardened, he kissed her silky hair and followed her into sleep.</p><p>Pain woke Kim. Her back burned and throbbed. Her mouth tasted like putrid metal and was so dry she couldn\u2019t swallow. Her head pounded, and even her eyelids felt lethargic. Obviously, she\u2019d been drugged. Again. The Overseer did it every time they moved the slaves. Said it decreased the chances of anyone causing trouble.</p><p>Where am I ? Lying on her side, she squinted at the painfully bright morning sunlight streaming in through French doors. Wake up, brain. The sale last night. Kneeling in front of a man. Dancing. The dungeon. Pain.</p><p>She stiffened. A heavy weight rested on her waist\u2014not covers, but a darkly tanned, very muscular arm. A man lay behind her, his legs tangled with hers. The Hispanic master had bought her. The one who\u2019d flogged her so cruelly her entire back still hurt like heck. His hard chest pressed against her, making the pain almost worse than the roiling nausea from the drugs and what she knew would come next.</p><p>And she needed to pee.</p> <p>She must have moved, for his slow breathing stopped. His arm tightened around her for a second, and then he sat up.</p><p>Before she could react, he rolled her onto her back.</p><p>She tried to move and felt the drag of a restraint on her right ankle. She closed her eyes. Welcome to your new owner. Time for a morning fuck. Her hands fisted as she froze, waiting for him to start pulling her clothing off.</p><p>Nothing happened.</p><p>After a minute, she opened her eyes. He lay on his side, propped up on one elbow, studying her, much as he\u2019d watched her last night in the dungeon.</p><p>She swallowed. What does he want?</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI\u2019m not going to jump on you, Kimberly. We need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk about what? Master.\u201d How he likes his blowjobs? How he\u2014</p><p>\u201cIf I told you that I bought you to free you, would you believe me?\u201d</p><p>She gave a mental snort. He was into mind-fucking like Lord Greville had been. \u201cIf Master wishes me to.\u201d</p><p>His dark brown eyes were unexpectedly soft. \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. We\u2019ll wait then.\u201d</p><p>Wait for what? \u201cYes, Master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me Raoul.\u201d</p><p>Now that was strange. She\u2019d never heard of a master welcoming such informality. And even if he did, she had no intention of calling him by his first name as if they were buddies or something. Never.</p><p>He undid the chain on her leg and helped her out of the bed. Her stomach twisted as she rose, her head spun, and she staggered sideways. His powerful hands closed around her waist, holding her up easily. Why did she have to get an owner who was so strong? How could she possibly escape him?</p><p>She would though. Probably not today\u2014he\u2019d be watching for an attempt.</p><p>And he did. Master R accompanied her into the bath. Dark wood, swirly tan marble, arched ceiling. Another rich bastard with the money to buy a slave. He pointed her to the walled-off toilet while he remained at the sink. She hid her scowl and studied the leaded glass window. She could fit. No problem.</p><p>She heard the water running, the sounds of him brushing his teeth, giving her the illusion of privacy at least. After peeing\u2014major relief\u2014she reluctantly joined him and washed her hands. Turning to hang up the hand towel, she winced when the movements pulled on her sore back.</p><p>\u201cCarajo,\u201d he said under his breath. \u201cPut your hands on the counter and hold still, Kimberly.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, here it comes. The fucking. From my friend, Raoul. Her insides curled up in a tight ball as she followed his order. He pulled her tank top all the way to her neck, and she closed her eyes. Why didn\u2019t it ever get easier?</p><p>A pause. Then he sighed. \u201cI\u2019m not planning to rape you, chiquita. I need to tend to the damage I did.\u201d He met her gaze in the mirror, his sympathy obvious. \u201cThis won\u2019t feel good, but it will help you heal. As will time.\u201d</p><p>When he touched her back, she flinched. God, it hurts.</p><p>His left hand tightened on her shoulder, keeping her in place as he tugged off the bandages, going far more slowly than she\u2019d expected. Rather than scrubbing her roughly, he gently washed her back. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I couldn\u2019t flog you lightly and still be believable.\u201d From a jar on the counter, he spread the ointment over her back.</p><p>Tears ran down her cheeks.</p><p>When he pushed her pants down, she stiffened, expecting\u2014but he simply washed and lotioned, pinning her against the counter to prevent her involuntary attempts to evade him.</p><p>\u201cAll done.\u201d He pulled her shirt down and her pants up.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t move as the pain filled her vision with red streaks.</p><p>When she raised her head, he rubbed his finger on her wet cheek. \u201cPobrecita,\u201d he murmured and added at her confused expression, \u201cPoor little one.\u201d After handing her a washcloth, he stepped out of the bathroom.</p><p>As she washed the tears from her face, as the pain died, she had to wonder: Why is he being so nice to me? The only answers she found were...ugly. She checked the window again. Too high to squirm through fast and... She glanced over her right shoulder at where he stood in the bedroom and met his knowing eyes.</p><p>He shook his head at her. \u201cCome. Let\u2019s have breakfast before people arrive.\u201d</p><p>Everything inside her shriveled. Other men. He wanted to show off his new slave. Maybe share.</p><p>Before they reached the bottom of the stairs, the doorbell rang. He glanced at the clock and grumbled, \u201cNo breakfast for either of us.\u201d He headed for the front door, his hand securely around her arm. \u201cPrepare yourself, Kimberly. You\u2019re in for a pleasant surprise.\u201d</p><p>Pleasant. Get real. She managed to keep the sneer from her face but heard his amused snort.</p><p>Her owner opened the door. And let go of her, stepping back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kim stared at the woman, unable to move, her world shivering to a halt. Red hair with a streak of blue, creamy skin, big blue eyes. Gabi?</p><p>A shriek of joy split the air. \u201cKim. Oh, God, Kim!\u201d Gabi grabbed her into a jumping-upand-down hug.</p><p>Fiery pain ripped through Kim, and she yelped.</p><p>\u201cDios!\u201d Master R pried Gabi off. \u201cStop it. Let go, Gabi. Now.\u201d</p><p>The sharp command froze Kim in place.</p><p>Gabi scowled at Raoul. \u201cRaoul, what are\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hurting her. I flogged her last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell did you do that for?\u201d</p><p>The fury in her best friend\u2019s face panicked Kim. If Gabi was rude to him... She grabbed Gabi\u2019s arm. \u201cShhh. Don\u2019t make him mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKim,\u201d Gabi said, \u201cyou don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh.\u201d She couldn\u2019t...couldn\u2019t let him hurt Gabi. She stepped in front of Master R. He\u2019d have to go through her first.</p><p>He didn\u2019t even try. Instead, he slowly stroked her hair, ignoring the way she flinched away. His eyes seemed as gentle as his hand. \u201cBrave chiquita. No one will hurt Gabi or you, Kimberly.\u201d He glanced at Gabi. \u201cIt was the only way I could get her out.\u201d</p><p>A man appeared on the doorstep. Styled brown hair, sharp blue eyes, taller than Master R. He took Gabi by the upper arms and lifted her to one side so he could enter the house. Obviously a master with a terrifying self-confidence.</p><p>Oh God, they\u2019d kidnapped Gabi too. As he greeted Master R, Kim swallowed and turned toward Gabi, whispering the horrible question, already knowing the answer. \u201cYou\u2019re a slave?\u201d</p><p>Gabi\u2019s eyes filled, and she took Kim\u2019s hands. \u201cOh Kim, no. Neither are you, sweetie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Kim stared at her, then at Master R. Her owner.</p><p>He looked down at her. \u201cI\u2019m no slaver, chiquita. I\u2019m working with the FBI, but you wouldn\u2019t believe me\u2014you thought I was trying to mess with your mind.\u201d</p><p>Kim shook her head. Her lips were numb. FBI? The air pulsed how around her, even though her face felt cold. Her knees sagged, melted into the floor, and the room whirled as she fell.</p><p>\u201cCarajo!\u201d Master R caught her and scooped her up, his arm like iron against her back, and she whimpered at the sear of pain from the welts.</p><p>\u201cShhh, chiquita.\u201d His smooth voice, velvety and warm, wrapped around her and eased her way into the blackness.</p><p>Raoul sat down on the couch in the great room, not wanting to release the little slave in his arms, the need to comfort stronger than anything he\u2019d known before. She\u2019d survived horrors, and the aftereffects were going to be with her for a long, long time.</p><p>As the color returned to her face, she blinked up at him, her eyes huge. Before she panicked, he eased her down beside him, close enough she could lean against him. If she chose to. He hurt to know she wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Gabi sat on her other side and took her hands. Did the women even realize they were both silently crying ?</p> <p>Marcus came from the kitchen with some juice. He squeezed Gabi\u2019s shoulder comfortingly as he handed Raoul the glass.</p><p>\u201cI want you to drink this, Kimberly,\u201d Raoul said, holding the glass to her lips.</p><p>After taking a dutiful sip, she looked at him through drenched eyelashes. \u201cReally? I\u2019m free?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d He frowned. \u201cBut there might be a few problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is a definite understatement. What the hell did you do?\u201d Buchanan walked into the house and slammed the door before stalking across the room. The big man had played defensive tackle in college and hadn\u2019t shrunk any in the intervening years. The Fed\u2019s Scottish complexion was turning an ominous dark red.</p><p>Well, he hadn\u2019t expected the FBI to be pleased, and at least he only had to deal with one of the pair. Raoul smiled. \u201cBuchanan. Meet Gabi\u2019s friend, Kimberly. She was up for sale last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you just had to save her?\u201d The agent sounded as if his teeth were grinding together. Then he frowned. \u201cReally? This is Kimberly Moore?\u201d He muttered something under his breath\u2014 probably as well that Raoul couldn\u2019t hear it\u2014and eased back. \u201cSorry, Sandoval. You were the one in the field. Hell, I\u2019d probably have done the same thing.\u201d He squatted in front of Kimberly. \u201cI\u2019m Special Agent Vance Buchanan with the FBI. Raoul is helping with our investigation. Last night, he was supposed to leave without any slaves, but\u201d\u2014he gave Gabi a smile\u2014\u201che knew how long Gabi\u2019s been trying to find you.\u201d</p><p>Gabi smiled through her tears and rubbed her shoulder against Kimberly\u2019s.</p><p>The little slave stared at Buchanan, Raoul, then Buchanan again. He could almost hear her brain kick into gear. \u201cAn FBI operation? What does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood question.\u201d Buchanan frowned at Raoul. \u201cHow badly is this operation blown? And how the hell did you get her out, let alone home?\u201d</p><p>Raoul smiled. \u201cNothing is blown...very much. I bought her, and the hired help brought us back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSandoval, you don\u2019t have that kind of money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZ set up an offshore account in case I happened to run across her.\u201d</p><p>Marcus snorted and dropped down in a chair, saying in his soft Southern voice, \u201cThat man is frightening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you bought her.\u201d Buchanan rose to pace across the room. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t remotely in any of our contingency plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But there\u2019s time to decide what to do. I told the Overseer I planned to use my mountain cabin to...break her in.\u201d Raoul looked down at Kimberly. Her blue eyes were like a rain-drenched sky. He used a finger to wipe the tears from her face, unaccountably relieved when she didn\u2019t flinch away from his touch. \u201cI have a bridge construction in Mexico needing my attention. Gabi can take Kimberly home with her.\u201d</p><p>Buchanan nodded. \u201cThat\u2019ll work. But we want a full report before you leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Raoul frowned at Marcus. \u201cMake sure she stays out of sight until we figure out how much danger she\u2019ll be in.\u201d</p><p>Marcus nodded. Considering the hell the lawyer had suffered when the slavers had kidnapped Gabi, Raoul knew his friend wouldn\u2019t be careless with either woman\u2019s safety.</p><p>Raoul turned back to Kimberly, his heart aching. In volunteering after an earthquake, he\u2019d seen survivors with the same shocked expression that showed they\u2019d discovered how unsafe the world could be. Every dominant gene in his body said she needed to be cared for, protected, helped\u2014and that he should be the one to do it. But a master was the last thing she wanted. \u201cGive me your wrist.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated a long moment, then held one arm out. After taking his keys from his pocket, he unlocked and removed her ankle and wrist cuffs. Finally the collar.</p><p>When he pulled it away, the relief on her face almost broke his heart.</p><p>A second later, her expression changed to fury. She plucked it from his fingers and threw it across the room, then cringed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Her shoulders stiffened as she braced for him to hit her.</p><p>\u201cRelax. I understand.\u201d He glanced at the collar, lying like a dead thing on the floor, remembering the first time he\u2019d collared a woman. She\u2019d had tears of joy, of gratitude in her eyes. She\u2019d kissed the leather and then his hands as he\u2019d buckled it around her neck. He\u2019d been humbled by her trust, determined to never let her down, to love and cherish her. The collar he\u2019d given his first slave had been padded on the inside, gentle on her skin.</p><p>He traced a finger over a scar and raw marks left on Kimberly\u2019s neck from the rough leather, before realizing she was forcing herself to hold still. No, he wouldn\u2019t go get his healing ointment. Not mine to care for. \u201cWill you be all right, chiquita?\u201d</p><p>She looked at him uncertainly, as if waiting for his anger, but all he had to offer was sorrow. She touched her bare neck, and determination filled her face. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d As she looked past him at the ocean, the storm in her eyes settled. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Gabi had invited over two friends, and Kim had hidden in the bathroom. Hoping to stall for another minute, she stared into the mirror. The blue sleeveless top Gabi had lent her fit fairly well since she hadn\u2019t regained all the weight yet. Eyes clear, nose and cheeks a little sunburned. Almost healthy looking, at least on the outside.</p><p>Faith, the psychologist, kept insisting self-assessment was a necessary part of recovering. Easy for her to say.</p><p>The past week had been...bad. Real bad. But\u2014she nodded at herself\u2014now she no longer cried so violently she\u2019d end up in the bathroom puking, although the tears still hit without warning. Her bouts of terror had lessoned, and hey, sometimes she even managed to talk herself out of one. The feeling something horrible would happen had gone from every second to oh...every few hours. Little victories. Of course, she had help from everyone, including a counselor.</p><p>Thank you, Master R. Even though he\u2019d never visited, she felt he was watching over her. Maybe it was the way a doctor had shown up soon after she\u2019d arrived at Gabi\u2019s house, then Faith that evening and daily after that. Gabi and Marcus had been surprised; Master R\u2014Raoul\u2014had arranged it without any consultation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Yesterday, she\u2019d gotten back the results of the tests the doctor had done. No nasty diseases. No pregnancy.</p><p>She patted her chest, smiling. Today, the elephant-on-the-chest sensation was gone. Yes, I\u2019m getting better. The counseling definitely helped. So did Gabi, with her years as a victim specialist and her own history of rape. Kim could share with Gabi things she couldn\u2019t tell Faith\u2014and vice versa. The two women gave her sympathy, hugs, and an occasional hard dose of reality. Gabi, especially, would shake her head and say, \u201cYeah, of course you\u2019re having panic attacks and nightmares. They might not ever go away completely, but they\u2019ll subside.\u201d</p><p>That helped a lot, knowing Gabi had gone on to have a life. To find love. And what a sweetie she\u2019d found. Kim sighed. Marcus couldn\u2019t disguise he was a dominant, but he kept his distance, never asking Kim to do anything, usually letting Gabi do the talking. Seeing his tenderness toward Gabi and the love he openly showed her had been healing in itself.</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t I have found someone like that? Why did the slavers choose me anyway? Other women liked BDSM, went to the clubs, didn\u2019t get Tasered and kidnapped. Chained and beaten. Why me? Because I\u2019m a slut? Kim peered into the mirror. Did it show on her face maybe?</p><p>Gabi had stopped visiting BDSM clubs years before. I kept going, even drove back from Savannah to visit the Atlanta club. So maybe Kim deserved everything she\u2019d gotten. Maybe she really was a slut and a fuckhole as Lord Greville had said.</p><p>Laughter came from the other room, breaking into her thoughts before the darkness overwhelmed her. With a shuddering breath, Kim pushed the bleakness aside and tried to remember what Gabi and the counselor had said. I\u2019m not a slut. Not.</p><p>\u201cKim, get out here,\u201d Gabi called. \u201cThe cookies are out of the oven. Jessica and Kari are hungry.\u201d</p><p>Enough already. Recovering would take time. Eventually, the FBI would give her permission to go home. I can do this. After splashing cold water on her face, Kim joined Gabi in the kitchen where the comforting fragrance of just-baked cookies filled the air.</p><p>The phone rang, and Gabi made a sound of exasperation. \u201cHere. Can you take these out?\u201d She handed over the platter and turned to answer the phone. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>As laughter came from the two women in the living room, Kim stood still, having to fight the urge to retreat into solitude.</p><p>Once she joined Jessica and Kari, she knew\u2014knew\u2014they would lighten her mood. That was something else that Gabi had done. When Kim had started to retreat from people, Gabi\u2019d brought in a couple of her submissive friends. Being in the lifestyle, they had a good idea of what had happened and how a person might react. Their understanding, without Kim having to explain, was wonderful. She liked them.</p><p>The only light during her captivity had been her friendship with the other slaves. Like Linda, the older woman who\u2014Kim swallowed\u2014who that fat scumbag had beaten. As the attendants had been bandaging Kim\u2019s back, she\u2019d heard the bastard refuse to buy the redhead, saying she was too old. God, had Linda survived what the Overseer did to slaves who didn\u2019t sell?</p><p>Kim hauled in a breath. Fretting wouldn\u2019t help, or so the counselor kept telling her. Only it made her so...so mad. And guilty, like she\u2019d abandoned Linda without doing anything to save her. But what could she have done? Maybe she\u2014</p><p>Gabi cleared her throat and made a fist, gesturing in the way that meant full speed ahead.</p><p>I should never have taught her those old tugboat signals. Kim nodded and headed into the living room.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got the cookies!\u201d Jessica trotted over. After one bite, the short blonde moaned in delight. \u201cKari, this is the best recipe.\u201d Another bite and she took a second cookie, sending a frown to the woman across the room. \u201cAnd hey, thanks for not helping me lose weight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZ likes you round,\u201d Kari said. \u201cI\u2019m just doing him a favor.\u201d</p><p>As Jessica curled up in a chair to nibble, Kim set the platter on the coffee table for Kari and tried not to laugh.</p><p>The very pregnant, sweet-faced schoolteacher was trying to lower herself into the other overstuffed chair. Finally, arms giving out, she dropped the last foot with a bounce and a squeak. After a squirm to settle, she gave Kim a composed smile. \u201cMade it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. God help you when you want to stand up again. And you still have another month?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I survive that long.\u201d Kari leaned forward to get a cookie and was stymied by her stomach. She giggled. \u201cHelp?\u201d</p><p>No one could be grumpy around these two. Jessica was intelligent, logical, and assertive. Kari almost beamed with joy at the new life inside her, despite being so short and round she resembled a bowling ball. Kim handed her a couple of cookies. \u201cAre you having a girl or a boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan doesn\u2019t want to know, and I let him have his way. Though he\u2019s getting ahead in winning arguments.\u201d</p> <p>Kim smiled. Yesterday, when Kari\u2019s husband had dropped her off for a visit, she\u2019d been spitting mad. Apparently Dan had seen her trying to adjust the driver\u2019s seat to accommodate her stomach, but not so far she couldn\u2019t reach the steering wheel. The dom had taken her car keys away.</p><p>Kim might have been angrier, except the man had driven Kari over himself. Hard-faced with cop\u2019s eyes, he looked really mean, yet he touched his wife as gently as Marcus did Gabi.</p><p>It was nice to be shown that all men weren\u2019t the enemy. But some are. Shoving the thought aside, she snatched a cookie and sat on the couch.</p><p>Gabi walked in, brows drawn together. She squeezed Kim\u2019s shoulder before sitting beside her. \u201cThat was Vance\u2014the guy from the FBI. He\u2019s coming today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Good.\u201d Kim\u2019s anticipation surged. They\u2019d asked her not to call her mother until they figured a few things out. Mom must be going crazy with worry. I need to go home. \u201cWhen will he be here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight away.\u201d</p><p>Jessica wrinkled her nose. \u201cThere\u2019s a typical man. He probably smelled the cookies baking all the way across the city.\u201d She leaned forward and picked up her glass of iced tea. \u201cSpeaking of which, can I take some home to Z? He loves chocolate chip cookies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho doesn\u2019t?\u201d Gabi said. \u201cBut sure, we made tons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEat up, Kari, and we\u2019ll leave before Vance shows up. Otherwise I\u2019ll question Mr. Closemouthed Special Agent about what\u2019s going on, and he won\u2019t spill, and I\u2019ll get mad and be rude.\u201d Jessica rolled her eyes. \u201cHe\u2019ll tell Z.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019d love it.\u201d Gabi snickered. \u201cWe all know you act out just to see what creative torture Z will use on you.\u201d</p><p>Jessica pointed her cookie at Gabi. \u201cTakes one to recognize one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is true.\u201d Gabi\u2019s satisfied smile looked exactly like her young cat\u2019s after it had snatched a chicken wing from the table. \u201cI\u2019m not sure who\u2019s more inventive, your dom or mine.\u201d</p><p>Kim shuddered. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, fuckhole. I\u2019m quite inventive at finding ways to break slaves.\u201d The whippings. The cage.</p><p>\u201cKim.\u201d</p><p>Kim jerked her head up at the sound of her name.</p><p>Worry darkened Jessica\u2019s green eyes as she said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m glad I\u2019ve recovered enough that you forgot,\u201d Kim said, remembering all the times she\u2019d dissolved into tears. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s nice to be reminded there\u2019s such a thing as teasing a dom for fun.\u201d</p><p>Kari grinned. \u201cIn that case, you should have been at the last barbecue when Gabi called Marcus a cretin and asked him if he\u2019d had an extra bowl of stupid that morning.\u201d</p><p>Kim felt the blood drain from her face. What had he done to her?</p><p>\u201cEasy, girl. He didn\u2019t beat on me or anything.\u201d Gabi bumped her shoulder against Kim\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019d rather have had the beating. Would you believe the butthead threw me in the pool after I\u2019d spent an hour on my hair and makeup? And I\u2019d done some really cool temp tattoos around my arms too.\u201d</p><p>Kim sputtered a laugh; the knot in her stomach eased.</p><p>\u201cYou looked so funny.\u201d Jessica rose and hauled Kari out of the chair with a grunt of effort, before grinning at Kim. \u201cShe kept cursing him, and he pushed her back in\u2014I think about four times before she cooled down enough to beg forgiveness. And then she hugged him.\u201d</p><p>Kari snickered. \u201cYou deliberately got his clothes all wet. He didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or curse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeach him to try to drown me.\u201d Still smirking, Gabi walked with the other two women to the front, exchanged good-byes, then returned to sit beside Kim. \u201cHey, Jessica forgot Z\u2019s treats\u2014more for us.\u201d Before she got a cookie to her mouth, the doorbell rang. \u201cWell, hell.\u201d</p><p>Someone from outside. Heart rate increasing, Kim grabbed her hand. \u201cNo, it might not be Vance. I hear another man too. You don\u2019t know who it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI recognize the voices. It\u2019s okay, girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>After a couple of slow breaths, Kim managed to let go of Gabi\u2019s hand. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeen there, done that. It takes time.\u201d Gabi hurried to the door and opened it.</p><p>The agent walked in first, followed by...Master R? In jeans and a white shirt, he nodded at Gabi, and then his dark gaze went straight to Kim. Intent, powerful. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her head spun, and her face burned, but the pit of her stomach felt as if she\u2019d swallowed ice cubes. Dizzily, she scrunched into a corner of the couch and pulled her legs up.</p><p>His mouth flattened into a straight line, and he said something to Vance too quiet to hear.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d In khakis and a blue short-sleeved shirt, Vance walked into the living room and took the chair directly across from the couch. \u201cHow are you doing, Kim?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. These are friends, not the enemy. Master R\u2014Raoul\u2014got me out. That was the only reason, she realized, she hadn\u2019t run for her bedroom. He\u2019d saved her. \u201cNot good, but better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots better,\u201d Gabi said staunchly and dropped down beside her.</p><p>Disconcertingly, Master R kneed the large ottoman closer to Kim and sat on it. Within touching distance.</p><p>Kim barely kept herself from shrinking away. She\u2019d forgotten how muscular he was. The sleeves of his polo shirt strained to fit around his thick biceps.</p><p>\u201cYou said you needed to talk about problems,\u201d Gabi prompted.</p><p>\u201cProblems, definitely. Our operation is...\u201d Vance\u2019s jaw tightened. \u201cThe Harvest Association auctions are big events with many buyers, lots of slaves, and a large number of the association\u2019s personnel. We\u2019ve wanted to raid one for some time, but they change the locations and give out the date and time of the auction only at the last minute. The buyers are transported in windowless vans with anti-tracking technology. Sandoval was to have refused the slaves, so he\u2019d get invited to the next auction. Instead...\u201d He gestured toward Kim.</p><p>Instead he bought me and won\u2019t get an invitation. Kim wet her dry lips. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not, chiquita,\u201d Master R said softly. \u201cWe\u2019ll figure something out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the FBI is angry and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Vance smiled slightly. \u201cWe can\u2019t be mad at him. He got referred as a buyer all on his own and was generous enough to let us in on the action.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know that,\u201d Gabi said. \u201cYou weren\u2019t recruited? But why?\u201d</p><p>Master R flashed her a grin. \u201cMy mam\u00e1 named me after Raoul Wallenberg. How can I not help?\u201d His mouth straightened. \u201cGabi, it\u2019s a dom\u2019s job to protect his submissives, not sit back while they volunteer to get kidnapped.\u201d He gave her a stern stare.</p><p>Kim gripped her friend\u2019s hand. Gabi had done insane things trying to rescue her. What if the slavers had actually succeeded and if\u2014</p><p>\u201cStop imagining,\u201d Gabi muttered to her. \u201cWhat happens now? Can Kim go home?\u201d</p><p>Vance hesitated, and Kim couldn\u2019t bear the silence. \u201cI know it\u2019s probably not good news. Just spit it out, okay?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cIf you can speak to me like that, you\u2019re doing better than I thought.\u201d</p><p>Master R growled. \u201cShe is very strong, but she has been very hurt. This is not\u2014\u201d</p><p>Vance broke in. \u201cFirst, going home isn\u2019t a good idea.\u201d He rubbed the back of his neck, his voice tight. \u201cWe\u2019ve discovered at least two slaves escaped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Gabi leaned forward. \u201cThen they can identify, testify\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can\u2019t,\u201d Vance said flatly. \u201cThey\u2019re dead along with anyone they talked with.\u201d</p> <p>Kim felt her skin go clammy. Going home would put her mother at risk?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Kim.\u201d Vance started to say something and then stopped. Waited.</p><p>Can\u2019t go home. God, by staying here... She swallowed and edged away from Gabi. \u201cThey might come after Gabi and Marcus?\u201d</p><p>Gabi broke in. \u201cDon\u2019t you even start thinking like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might not be a good idea to stay here,\u201d Vance interrupted.</p><p>If she ran, where would she hide? The Overseer claimed they had people in every state. She had no money. Her arms wrapped around her legs. The tide was coming in, and it was black.</p><p>\u201cKimberly,\u201d a low, resonant voice said. \u201cKimberly.\u201d Master R\u2019s voice.</p><p>She shuddered and looked at him.</p><p>His eyes held hers. \u201cBetter. You will listen to everything before you panic. You have options, chiquita.\u201d His intent gaze stayed on her as he prompted, \u201cBuchanan, go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are trying to accomplish two things,\u201d Vance said. \u201cTo keep you safe and to continue with the operation of shutting down the slavers in the Southeast quadrant. You have a couple of choices.\u201d He waited for her nod. \u201cWe can put you into a witness-protection program. Sandoval will report you died\u2014we can\u2019t risk saying you escaped, in case they go after your family\u2014and he\u2019ll ask to buy another slave. The downside is your death would have to be public enough they\u2019d know it was true. Your family would... It might be difficult for them.\u201d</p><p>Kim stared. Have Mom think I\u2019m dead? Is he insane? \u201cWhat\u2019s the other plan?\u201d It must be better.</p><p>\u201cWe give up on having Sandoval attend the auction. Instead he\u2019d refer someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds good,\u201d Gabi said.</p><p>\u201cIt would be except for the Association\u2019s fu\u2014damned precautions. The only way to talk to the Overseer is at the follow-up visit.\u201d Vance frowned at Kim. \u201cThe visit where he finds out if the customer is satisfied. Where he\u2019ll expect to see you, Buchanan\u2019s slave. A good slave, since otherwise you get returned.\u201d</p><p>Kim felt the ground drop away. Be a slave. Meet the Overseer again?</p><p>\u201cGod, no.\u201d Gabi scowled. \u201cShe can\u2019t handle that.\u201d</p><p>All the feeling had receded from Kim\u2019s fingers. How white they\u2019d gotten. Did she have any blood left inside her? \u201cHow long is the visit? How long would I have to pretend?\u201d She\u2019d have to see the Overseer. Deep inside her body, her bones shook like a Halloween skeleton in a cold wind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. Probably a couple of hours at least, maybe an evening.\u201d Vance shook his head. \u201cBut, Kim, the problem is this: the Overseer doesn\u2019t make contact for a few weeks. At that point, he\u2019d expect to see a fairly well-trained slave. One who knows Sandoval\u2014his habits, his protocols.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe could fake it.\u201d</p><p>Vance snorted. \u201cDon\u2019t play stupid, Gabi. This isn\u2019t something a slave picks up in an hour. When Marcus nods at the floor, does he mean strip and prostrate yourself, suck his cock, or present yourself doggy-style, or maybe kneel with your hands on your thighs? Or does he prefer your hands behind your head?\u201d</p><p>With a sinking feeling, Kim saw Gabi\u2019s understanding nod.</p><p>\u201cBut maybe she could be...well, kept in a separate room. Like Raoul only uses her for sex or something?\u201d Gabi asked.</p><p>Master R shook his head. \u201cDuring my interview with the Overseer, he asked what functions my slave would perform. I said I wanted service as well as sex. I never imagined being caught in this kind of situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho could?\u201d Vance asked. \u201cSo Kim would be expected to serve and be present in the room. Having her cringe if her master\u2019s displeased wouldn\u2019t be unusual, but cringing whenever he touches her\u2014or even looks at her? No. Not knowing what to do when he motions for something?\u201d Vance\u2019s gaze turned to Kim, pity softening his blue eyes. \u201cYou can\u2019t fake this kind of slavery, sweetie. You\u2019d have to live with Sandoval starting now and actually be his slave, in order to act like one in front of someone as experienced as the Overseer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already told you no. I won\u2019t have anything to do with this,\u201d Master R said in a hard voice. \u201cShe can\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>The tiny amount of pride left in Kim flickered at how easily he\u2019d dismissed her. She could do whatever she put her mind to. But the rest of her agreed. Go back to being a slave? No way.</p><p>But to have them tell her mother she was dead? Would Mom survive such a devastating blow? No.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see any other choice,\u201d Vance said. \u201cNot if\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bought her to free her, not to torment her further.\u201d Master R interrupted. \u201cShe has enough nightmares without me adding to them. What if she panics when he\u2019s there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a deal-breaker,\u201d Vance said. At the deadly look Master R gave him, he shrugged. \u201cTo still be struggling with her problems would be normal enough. So would jumpiness. But she can\u2019t fake training she never gets. Most masters do some instruction, even for a sex slave. The kicker is that you not only asked for a service slave, you\u2019re also known in the lifestyle as being an excellent teacher. I\u2019m sorry, Raoul. You\u2019ll have to train her\u2014and you\u2019ll have to touch her as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I could go and be there with her? It would be easier with...company or something,\u201d Gabi offered.</p><p>Kim looked up. Maybe that\u2014</p><p>Vance shook his head. \u201cThey do an extensive background on the buyers, so they know Sandoval lives alone. They might do some monitoring after the sale. For him to bring in another woman right after he buys a slave would be downright unlikely and would probably send up a warning flag.\u201d He scowled. \u201cThey\u2019re paranoid bastards.\u201d</p><p>Warning flag. Ice water trickled into Kim\u2019s core as she remembered... She closed her eyes, took a breath. She had to tell them, but her words stuck to her tongue. \u201cVance.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Master R was still fighting to keep her out of it. \u201cThere\u2019s always the demonstration. I could get into an auction that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Vance said. \u201cBut that only gets you on the waiting list for God knows when in the future. Besides, the Overseer would still expect to see Kim since your audition is during the follow-up visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVance,\u201d Kim said, raising her voice. Their attention shifted to her. \u201cThe gossip in... I heard from the other slaves that if a buyer kills a slave, they don\u2019t contact him for quite a while in case he didn\u2019t cover up well enough, or the body\u2019s found or there\u2019re witnesses. Repercussions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell.\u201d Vance scowled. \u201cThen pretending you died won\u2019t work. At least not for getting Sandoval into an auction in the near future, either as a buyer or doing a demo.\u201d He cursed under his breath.</p> <p>Silence. The number of eyes on her made her shake, and she stared at her hands. Such white fingers, all twined together in knots.</p><p>Master R\u2019s voice. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d She looked up into compassion. Worry. \u201cGo into the witness protection program anyway, Kimberly. Stay safe and out of sight.\u201d</p><p>How incredible it felt to have someone on her side. In slavery, each woman stood alone, for if one tried to protect another, both were beaten. She winced as a lash cracked across her memory. But now... She wasn\u2019t at their mercy, and the man beside her, like a massive tank, was so, so not helpless.</p><p>How could she find a plan that would work? At one time, she\u2019d been good at solutions. Back...before. But now... Pretend to be dead and be safe, but her mother would suffer, and she\u2019d have ruined any chance of getting the FBI to the auction. Be a slave and...oh God, she couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the other slaves still in their grasp, Raoul?\u201d Vance asked, his voice edged with pain. With pity. \u201cCan you abandon them so easily?\u201d</p> <p>The question was a blow straight to Kim\u2019s chest. She watched as Master R turned his face away, the skin taut over his cheekbones. He\u2019d planned the whole thing to rescue all the slaves and abandoned it to save her. Just her. While the rest\u2014Holly and Linda and the others\u2014were still there. They\u2019d never get out. Because of me. Because he rescued me.</p><p>Guilt settled in her belly, cold and leaden, and with every breath she could hear Holly\u2019s terrified screams, as if the dungeon were only a few feet away. I can\u2019t. Can\u2019t be a slave. Her throat felt as if a rope bound it, contracting to keep the words from escaping.</p><p>But to leave them there? Linda had changed the bandages on Kim\u2019s stomach, her hands gentle and careful. She\u2019d told jokes to make Kim laugh, diverting her from memories of how Lord Greville had... I can\u2019t do this. But then Linda would be never get free. She\u2019d live in pain. She had two children in college. Talked about being a grandmother someday. Held Kim when she cried. She\u2019d been so strong, but eventually everybody would break, even Linda.</p><p>Is it worth it to live if I betray...everyone ? She looked at her wrists. The bruises from the cuffs had faded to a faint yellow. I endured before. I can endure again. No, she probably couldn\u2019t. She\u2019d die if she was a slave again. No no no. She looked at Master R, who still stared out the window. He\u2019d tried to soothe her fears. He\u2019d held her, not hurting her, but\u2014she shivered\u2014not letting her go either. He did as he thought best. He was a dom.</p><p>I can\u2019t do it, can\u2019t even pretend to be a slave. No.</p><p>Holly had cried herself to sleep every night. Every night.</p> <p>I have to do this . The nausea came fast, choking her, and she inhaled through her nose, forcing it back. I\u2019m me. Not a slave, even if I choose to pretend. And I will do this. Because I\u2019m me. Not broken.</p><p>A warm hand closed on her upper arm. \u201cChiquita...Kimberly...look at me.\u201d</p><p>She heard him sometimes in her dreams, his voice breaking through the storm of screaming, and everything would calm, the slow smooth baritone as comforting as the ocean rocking a boat. She looked up at him. \u201cI\u2019ll be your s-slave.\u201d</p><p>Had he ever seen anyone look so terrified and still manage to move? Raoul leaned against the door frame and watched Kimberly enter his home. Her dusky complexion was a grayish pale, her cheekbones standing out above a clenched jaw. She walked as if the tile floor was covered with sharp spikes.</p><p>He sighed. She was incredibly brave, but he had doubts she could maintain her courage. Gabi might get a call this evening begging for rescue.</p><p>Kim saw him watching and took a step back. \u201cWhat would you like me to do now, M-master R?\u201d</p><p>Stop looking at me as if I plan to slice you into inch-sized chunks of flesh. He glanced at his watch. \u201cIt\u2019s almost suppertime. Why don\u2019t we sit on the patio\u201d\u2014 where you won\u2019t feel as cornered\u2014\u201cand talk? Then we can figure out what to do for supper.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a jerky nod.</p> <p>He led the way through the great room and out the French doors. Sun sparkled off the wide expanse of water. On the shore, waves lapped quietly on the sand. Behind him\u2014silence. He turned.</p><p>She was on her knees, hugging herself, staring at the beach, at the waves rolling in. The breeze ruffled her hair back, and the setting sun glinted off the tears on her cheeks. She cried as silently as anyone he\u2019d ever known.</p><p>Very slowly, he dropped to one knee and touched her cheek with his fingertips to get her attention. He could feel tiny shudders running through her. \u201cKimberly, can you tell me why you\u2019re crying?\u201d Should he call Gabi now?</p><p>To his complete shock, she rubbed her cheek against his hand like an overwhelmed kitten, and her blue, blue eyes looked up at him. \u201cI forgot. I didn\u2019t even remember...\u201d</p><p>He cupped her cheek and rubbed her shoulder, feeling the fragile bones. \u201cWhat did you forget, gatita?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou live on the beach. On the gulf.\u201d Her eyes were wide\u2014not with fear, but with joy. \u201cI can breathe again. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and rubbed his knuckles over her curving cheek. Perhaps this was not such a forlorn hope after all. If she could share happiness with him, then the rest would come.</p><p>The next day, Kim stepped out of the guest room onto the long balcony overlooking the gulf. Master R had an interesting place in a beach-house-meets-hacienda way. It was two-story stucco except for a small third story, like a tower, and curved in a C shape around the patio up from the sandy shore. With huge arched windows and balconies everywhere, the inside seemed to merge into the outdoors.</p><p>She squinted against the bright sunlight that reflected on the water. Almost noon. She\u2019d hidden in the bedroom since breakfast.</p><p>With a sigh, she dropped onto the dark red cushioned chair. Bare feet on the iron railing, she leaned her head back, immersing herself in the feeling of the moisture forming on her skin, the ocean breeze, the heat of the sun. Waves lapped quietly on the sand, the gentle gulf surf nothing like that of her energetic Atlantic. A gull circled, screeching.</p><p>Oh, she\u2019d missed the ocean. The rhythm of her life had been marked by the tides, starting on her father\u2019s fishing trawler to her work as a marine biologist. But slaves were shut inside, never to see the sun or hear the surf. Worse than any drug addict, she\u2019d craved the sound and smell of the shore.</p><p>She\u2019d probably scared Master R with her reaction last night, but apparently he\u2019d understood. He\u2019d laughed.</p><p>He can laugh . He had a great laugh. Braced by the knowledge, she\u2019d made it through yesterday evening without panicking. She\u2019d been quite proud of herself.</p><p>A noise came from the room behind her, and she glanced over her shoulder. Sitting with her back to a door felt as if she asked to be attacked, but she forced herself to stay. To try to relax. To ignore the certainty a stranger would come out of nowhere and grab her. Knowing Master R was in the house helped...at least with the stranger-abduction fear.</p><p>It sucked to have so many fears she had to name them.</p><p>Would Master R create more terror than he eased? A tremor ran through her. I don\u2019t know him at all. Aside from insisting she eat supper with him, he\u2019d left her alone last evening, letting her get used to his house, to losing Gabi\u2019s support...although Gabi had called about every half hour to check on her. Kim smiled. Sweet Gabi.</p><p>But Master R apparently realized how terrifying his presence was\u2014not for anything he\u2019d done, but because he was male. A dom.</p><p>He was even more careful with her than Marcus had been. Like last night when she\u2019d had a nightmare. Nothing new. Usually Gabi would hear her screams and wake her up. This time it had been Master R.</p><p>\u201cKimberly.\u201d His voice had entered her dream, where she was pinned down, unspeakable things...pain... \u201cKimberly!\u201d Such a smooth voice. The horrors reverberated through her in the slaps, the burning. \u201cWake up, chica!\u201d A sharp command. A master\u2019s voice. Her eyes had snapped open. A man in the doorway. Another scream, awake now, but the lights were on, and she saw\u2014after a minute\u2014the man who had bought her. Freed her. Master R.</p><p>He\u2019d waited until she said his name before entering, then fetched her a glass of water from the bathroom. Pulled up a chair. Let her drink and shake. He hadn\u2019t touched her once, and his presence had turned comforting. Did he know if he\u2019d loomed over her, she\u2019d have gone into hysterics? That she couldn\u2019t stand being touched right then, not after the nightmare of so many men? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d watched her, patient and quiet, then picked up the book she had on the bedside table and simply read to her in that voice, dark with a twist of accent. No nightmare could compete with Raoul Sandoval reading Huckleberry Finn.</p><p>So she really was better. Maybe the spark of her very self hadn\u2019t gone out. Maybe she wasn\u2019t filthy inside, deserving of everything done to her and more. Only she felt dirty. Ugly and ruined. She blinked against the welling tears. Would \u201cfilthy slut\u201d echo in her mind forever?</p><p>The psychologist hadn\u2019t made much progress with her feelings of self-loathing. Or with helping her to figure out what came next, after this was over. How could she go back to her job, knowing someone might grab her again? That\u2014</p><p>She heard a footstep and jerked around, heart jackhammering against her ribs.</p><p>\u201cEasy, gatita.\u201d Master R stopped. Waited, his eyes steady on hers.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have the right to be jumpy.\u201d He squatted beside her chair, tilting her chin up to wipe her cheeks with his fingers. \u201cAnd to cry. No matter how strong you are, I think you will be in tears often for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we going to start...?\u201d She couldn\u2019t finish, hated how pitiful she sounded.</p><p>\u201cWhen you are ready, Kimberly, come downstairs and we\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKim. Everyone calls me Kim.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, and for a second, she saw the dom he was. Self-confident. Powerful. He would do what he wanted.</p><p>A shiver ran through her. \u201cYou really are a dom, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am.\u201d He released her chin and brushed his knuckles down her cheek. \u201cBut you\u2019re safe, chiquita. The only slave I want is one whose dearest wish is to be mine.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to own a slave? A chill settled deep in her bones.</p><p>An hour later, Raoul pushed his keyboard to one side and rested his forearms on the massive oak desk. The design for a new waterfront area in Belize couldn\u2019t keep his attention.</p><p>Could Kimberly tolerate being a slave? He wasn\u2019t a harsh master, but he wasn\u2019t a pushover either, and since he\u2019d acted like a cold bastard for the Overseer, turning into a hearts-and-flowers master wouldn\u2019t cut it. Honesty would serve both him and Kimberly best. After all the upheavals in her life, she\u2019d need the stability\u2014the reassurance\u2014of consistency.</p><p>He looked up at a sound from the door.</p><p>She stood there, her face pale, but chin up and standing straight. Brave little subbie. Satisfaction welled in him as he noted her cheeks had started to round out. Gabi\u2019s cooking and pampering had put some weight on her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready to talk,\u201d she said. \u201cIs this a bad time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is fine.\u201d He rose and saw her force herself to stand still.</p><p>In the doorway, he put his hand on her back, touching her as he\u2019d avoided doing before. He felt her tremble. His brows drew together as he realized he was seeing her in two ways: as a hurt woman and as a willing sub. How had his mind ever received the impression she was willing? Yet there had been times in the slaver\u2019s dungeon, when their rhythms had come together, and she\u2019d unconsciously accepted him as dominant.</p><p>He paused, then turned toward the stairs, steering her up past the second floor to the third and into the tower room. Their discussion should be in a private place. Intimate. Not his office. And the great room was for guests.</p><p>Here, the steeply angled roof formed two sides of the square room, but the front and back walls were all glass, giving a breathtaking view of the sea to the west and his gardens to the east. The floor was a rich brown pile, the off-white sectional soft and welcoming. The toys for bondage and play stayed hidden inside the sturdy ottoman and bomb\u00e9 chest by the wall.</p> <p>\u201cThis is beautiful,\u201d she said, walking to the window with the ocean view.</p><p>So are you, little submissive. The light of the afternoon sun glinted off her straight black hair, bringing out brown tints, and silhouetted her slim figure. Under the loose-fitting clothing, she had a pretty body, he recalled. So thin, yet still graceful with nicely curved hips. He pointed to the sofa, saw her hesitation, and patiently waited for her to take a seat.</p><p>What should have been eagerness to obey\u2014and probably had been once\u2014was fear instead. His heart ached that anyone could treat a woman so harshly. He sat on the sturdy square ottoman, knee to knee with her, the sofa back keeping her from retreating farther. \u201cWe\u2019re going to talk about what I expect and what you will do. And we\u2019ll get to know each other, gatita.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s gatita mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLittle cat. Kitten.\u201d He tugged on her black hair. \u201cBaby cats often have blue eyes, and when I was young, I had a black kitten with big blue eyes.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cYou called me chiquita.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLittle girl.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t like that. \u201cYou said pobre-something means poor little baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cThat\u2019s an awful lot of littles, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d He displayed his hand. \u201cBig.\u201d He set hers next to his, so small and delicate contrasted with his thick, blunt fingers. Why did holding her fragile hand raise every protective instinct he had? \u201cLittle.\u201d</p><p>When she huffed in exasperation, he captured her other hand and leaned forward. \u201cNow, tell me what happened when you were a slave.\u201d</p><p>His unexpected question felt like a kick to the stomach. Talk about it? No way. Kim attempted to withdraw, and his fingers tightened. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d Her mind shifted, trying to detach from her body.</p><p>\u201cYou heard me, Kimberly. Until this is over, I will be your dom\u2014your master. I will expect you to follow orders. Your body will be available to me\u2014\u201d</p><p>She froze.</p><p>\u201cNo, not for sex,\u201d he added with a sigh. \u201cBut my hands will be on you at times. You need to become accustomed to my touch so you\u2019re not jumping.\u201d</p><p>She managed a nod. I knew this. I did. Why did it seem much more intimidating when she was looking at those powerful hands?</p><p>\u201cI expect you to tell me when something bothers you\u2014and things will. I need to know what to avoid, and I can\u2019t help you if you can\u2019t share what happened.\u201d</p><p>Go into it? Talk about it? With him? His fingers were hot against her skin as the ice crept into her hands.</p><p>\u201cShare with me, Kimberly.\u201d His voice was a grave baritone, the slight Spanish accent softening it. \u201cWhen did they kidnap you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA-about maybe seven weeks ago.\u201d The pain, horrible pain from the Taser, then a sting. The world going fuzzy, then she awoke to terror. A nasty kick when she threw up, a slap when she cried too loudly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d forgotten it was so long. Did they hold you for a while before they auctioned you off? What happened during that period?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey...didn\u2019t do much. I was penned up with the others for...I think almost two weeks?\u201d The time was blurry, crying women, leering men, nothing to do. The days ran together. \u201cOur \u2018rebelliousness\u2019 was a selling point, so we got no training.\u201d She swallowed, remembering how scared she\u2019d been. If she\u2019d known what would come after, she\u2019d have jumped overboard right then. \u201cI didn\u2019t go to the big auction though. Lord Greville bought me a while before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe owner who sent you back to the Overseer?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, blinking furiously. I won\u2019t cry.</p><p>Master R\u2019s hands squeezed her fingers. \u201cTell it all.\u201d</p><p>He needed the information. But it was hard. \u201cHe took me to his house.\u201d Cold with white walls and furniture, no comfort anywhere. \u201cHe had his servants hold me down, and h-he raped me.\u201d She forced the word out. After a week of talking with Gabi and Faith, she could say it now\u2014say it without vomiting. \u201cI fought them. He beat me until I passed out. And raped me again.\u201d And again and again.</p><p>\u201cWas he the one who used a whip on you?\u201d Master R asked, his voice even.</p><p>She nodded, looking at their entwined hands. \u201cEach time, each day. The pain\u2014\u201d So much pain that every breath had hurt, until it billowed in her head, made her vision waver. Until all she could think was, Make it stop. \u201cI couldn\u2019t quit fighting, even...even though...\u201d Blood in her mouth, on the floor, the stink of sweat and sex.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s why the bastard wanted you\u2014because you\u2019d fight back.\u201d His fingers massaged hers. \u201cSo you\u2019ve had both physical and sexual abuse. How about mental? Did he call you names?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Slut, cunt, dirty whore. Did the filth inside her show? Could Master R see the darkness? She tried to laugh. \u201cEven some words I\u2019d never heard of before. He said I deserved everything I got because I was a slut. Bad. Filthy. He locked me in a cage during the day\u2014put my water and food in bowls because I was an animal.\u201d She dared to look up, had to, and saw his black frown. \u201cThat\u2019s why he gave me to his friends.\u201d Her throat clogged as her stomach turned over.</p><p>He cursed under his breath and gripped her chin with those strong fingers, pulling her head up. \u201cLook at me, chiquita.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze came up to meet his dark brown eyes, patient. Firm.</p><p>\u201cGood. Now take a breath. Yes. Let it out slowly. That\u2019s a good girl.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The memories retreated, pushed away by his anger...for her. Her nausea eased.</p><p>After she\u2019d managed a few breaths, he sat back, taking her hand again. \u201cOthers used you. And?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI stabbed him afterwards.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, then burst out laughing, and with the sound of his hearty laughter, open and pleased, the darkness in her head shrank. He kissed her fingers. \u201cGood for you. But...I think this is why you were hurt so badly?\u201d</p> <p>Badly. She couldn\u2019t answer, just started to shake.</p><p>A growl came from him. He plucked her up like a dandelion and sat down with her in his arms. Warmth and strength enfolded her, not frightening her. Somehow. How did being ordered to talk make her blurt things out like that?</p><p>He waited, simply holding her, one hand running up and down her arm. As her trembling slowed, he said, \u201cI know something of trauma. I have friends who were in war. Others survived the gangs. You will continue with the counselor\u2014she and Gabi can come here\u2014but even so, things will set you off. Panic you or make you cry. I expect that.\u201d</p><p>Gabi? And Faith? Not alone, not abandoned. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if simply talking does this to you, then I need to know the rest, so I can help you through it. Or avoid it. Do you understand?\u201d</p> <p>She felt dirty. Weak and useless and ruined. But he was right. She bit her lip and nodded.</p><p>\u201cHow did you manage to stab Lord Greville, and what did he do afterward?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs the...men...were leaving, I hid a knife in my dancing scarves.\u201d Crawling to the veils, pulling them around her, knotting one over the blade. Her blood staining the delicate fabric. Trying to stand. Falling. Pushing to her feet. Blood trickling down her legs like warm water. \u201cWhen he returned for me, I stabbed him.\u201d She swallowed. The blade punching through his shirt, then his skin, his flesh resisting. \u201cHe jerked away as I did. Enough that I got his shoulder and not his heart. He hit me.\u201d Knocked her across the room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you were not more accurate,\u201d Master R said mildly. \u201cAnd then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe yelled, and his staff came. He was crazy mad.\u201d Blood everywhere, yelling, insanity in his eyes. \u201cHe whipped me and then got the knife I\u2019d used.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll cut you into pieces. Scream, slut.\u201d She touched her ribs where the long slash had opened her to the bone. The pain had bloomed and grown and grown. \u201cBut he\u2019d lost enough blood that he passed out.\u201d She\u2019d hurt so much, too much to glory in it. \u201cThey tied a bandage around my ribs and put me back in the cage. The little one.\u201d Not the kennel. Made for a medium-sized dog and so small she couldn\u2019t straighten her legs, couldn\u2019t stand up. Couldn\u2019t move. Couldn\u2019t... Her lungs spasmed like a fish on dry land, suffocating with air all around.</p><p>\u201cShhh, shhh.\u201d A big hand stroked her hair. \u201cYou\u2019re here, gatita. No one will hurt you.\u201d</p> <p>Here. She blinked away the darkness at the edge of her vision. \u201cThey left me... I don\u2019t know how long.\u201d In the dark. Never let out. Bleeding. Hurting. Peeing on herself, her legs wet and stinking. The cage stinking. Her voice had broken from screaming. \u201cEventually they came and got me.\u201d When the door opened, she knew she\u2019d die and felt only relief.</p><p>He shook her gently, breaking her from the nightmarish thoughts. \u201cBreathe for me, Kimberly.\u201d</p><p>Slow breath. She stared out at the waves. The small windows lining the huge ones were cracked open, and the ocean\u2019s shushing sounds rolled over her, drawing her memories away, grain by grain.</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d He drew her back to the present. \u201cThey took you out and...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Overseer was there. They made him take me back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPobrecita,\u201d Master R murmured.</p><p>Too tired to be afraid, she laid her cheek against his soft shirt. Beneath the thick muscles of his chest, his heart beat slowly, evenly, his breathing pulling hers into a matching rhythm. Under the influence of the even pace, she found her voice again. \u201cThe Overseer was furious because he said I was damaged, but he gave them a refund since Lord Greville\u2019d brought in a lot of referrals. One of the Overseer\u2019s slaves sewed me up, and I didn\u2019t do anything for a while. After the stitches came out, I helped out in the kitchen for another week. And learned to dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo hospital?\u201d</p> <p>She managed a laugh. \u201cHardly. Although I got antibiotics. I think they were for dogs from a feed store.\u201d I\u2019m an animal.</p><p>\u201cWell, I see why you were a bargain,\u201d he said, breaking up her thoughts. \u201cAlmost killing your owner would definitely lower your value.\u201d He tapped a finger on her nose. \u201cGood job.\u201d</p><p>She blinked, startled. A trickle of warmth crept into her at the open approval in his voice.</p><p>\u201cAside from being kidnapped, which would leave you insecure, most of what terrifies you happened at this Greville\u2019s house? Rape, cage, beating. The way they treated you, being called names\u2014you feel as if they\u2019re right? That you\u2019re what they called you?\u201d</p><p>Why did it help when he...listed...things? Because it sounded like a set of problems she could deal with instead of an overwhelming chasm she\u2019d fall into? \u201cI... Yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmmh. You get counseling already. I\u2019ll add in some self-defense, so if you have to stab someone, you\u2019ll do a better job.\u201d He waited for her nod. \u201cGetting over being raped will take time, but since you\u2019re here in my arms, it might not be the worst of your problems. But you suffered enough that things will set you off. Unless your counselor says otherwise, we\u2019ll stop, go through your fear so you handle it, and if possible repeat the trigger until it doesn\u2019t work any longer.\u201d</p><p>Maybe she could survive. Except... \u201cNot the cage.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo, that one is for your counselor to deal with. You and I will stick with what causes you problems in your slave training.\u201d</p><p>Slave. The word made her want to retch. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you will, chiquita.\u201d</p><p>As his arms tightened around her, she felt fear and safety mingle inside her as she was comforted...by her master. God had the oddest sense of humor.</p><p>With a low groan, Raoul pushed the weight slowly upward, his arms shaking with the strain. At the top, he dropped the bar into the rack, the clank loud in his empty weight room.</p><p>As he sat up on the bench and shook out his arms, sweat plastered his tank top to his skin, and his pecs and triceps burned. His body made the shadows on the wall dance. He\u2019d deliberately left off most of the lights, the darkness suiting his mood.</p><p>He\u2019d managed to keep from showing his fury when Kimberly talked about her kidnapping, but, Dios, it had been difficult to hear her voice tremble, feel her scarred body tremble.</p><p>An hour of lifting weights, of pushing himself to exhaustion and beyond, had restored his control. Leaning forward, he set his elbows on his knees and stared at his forearms. His skin was taut over the pumped muscles. His veins bulged. Yes, he was fucking strong.</p><p>Uselessly strong. He\u2019d been too late to save his brother from dying in a filthy alley, too late to rescue this little slave before her abuse. Even worse, next time he saw the Overseer, he couldn\u2019t beat him into the ground. Not yet. His jaw tightened until his teeth ground together. Hopefully later.</p><p>For now, his task was to heal the damage to Kimberly\u2019s soul...and train her as his slave. He dropped his head into his hands, despair edging through his defenses. A slave. Here, in his house, the one he\u2019d built after his divorce, not wanting to live with any memories of Alicia and their failed Master/slave relationship.</p><p>Now he would bring it back into his life.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>That evening, Raoul made Kimberly fix stir-fry while he sat on a tall chair at the kitchen island, sipping a beer. The way she moved was as beautiful as the way she danced. No motion wasted, everything in order. But the multitasking was making his head hurt. When he cooked, he\u2019d fix one part; when it was done, he\u2019d prepare the next. The little slave had several different preparations going on at once.</p><p>The slight smile on her face pleased him. Cooking was a comfort to her. He\u2019d remember that.</p><p>Once the meal was on the table, he took a chair, holding up a finger to stop her before she sat down. As she stood beside the table, he helped himself to a bite. The flavors were excellent\u2014 strong and well balanced. \u201cVery good, chiquita.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Sir,\u201d she said in a distant voice. She\u2019d withdrawn emotionally from him since their talk. He understood. He tended to do the same, but it couldn\u2019t be permitted. If she bottled up her anger and fear, he wouldn\u2019t be able to read her or help.</p><p>\u201cYou sound unhappy.\u201d He rested his arm on the back of the chair, deliberately letting his gaze wander down her body, the loose blue T-shirt, the baggy shorts. She\u2019d put her hair into a long braid, and he missed seeing it free. \u201cI think I have been a tolerant master so far. I even let you wear clothing while you were cooking.\u201d</p><p>When her eyes widened, he frowned. At the sale house, she\u2019d shown skill in serving drink and food. In dancing. She\u2019d kept her eyes down, knelt gracefully, spoken only when told. Had she received more training than that? She\u2019d said she was left alone after her kidnapping and then was sold to a sadist to be used for whippings and sex. After her return to the Overseer, she\u2019d spent most of the time healing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She not only had received little training, she might have no realization at what being a true full-time submissive entailed. He rubbed his cheek thoughtfully. If she hadn\u2019t been so emotionally fragile, he\u2019d probably enjoy this. He loved teaching.</p><p>He\u2019d loved being a master, at least until a while after he\u2019d married. His mouth tightened. That was in the past and nothing to be repeated.</p><p>When she took a nervous step back, he wiped the anger from his expression and his mind. Eyes on the job, Sandoval. He pointed to the chair beside him. \u201cYou may join me this evening at the table.\u201d</p><p>As she sat down, her face was easy to read. Yes, she had much to learn.</p><p>\u201cThere may be times I prefer to feed you myself, and then you will kneel beside me and take food from my hand.\u201d When a shudder ran through her, he studied her for a minute, trying to read her. Too many emotions there. Fear. Disgust. But was that a hint of anticipation? \u201cThe Overseer said you were in the lifestyle before this. Do you know anything about Master/slave relationships in real life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, not much. I dated a few doms, but that was mostly...uh, sex. Fun. Nothing else. I always thought women who wanted to be slaves... Well, it\u2019d be like wearing a sign that said KICK ME. It\u2019s disgusting.\u201d An odd combination of revulsion and pain twisted her mouth.</p><p>If she had no experience, why such disgust? From someone else\u2019s past? \u201cSo...before all this...you liked giving up control during sex. Perhaps to completely enjoy it, you need someone else in charge?\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks pinkened delightfully. \u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>He smothered his smile. \u201cSome women enjoy giving up control for longer periods, not just in the bedroom. There are those who find that making others happy, especially their doms, fills a different kind of need.\u201d</p><p>From the cynical twist of her lips, he saw she stuck to her opinion: slave equaled doormat.</p><p>\u201cA good relationship is a two-way street, gatita. Submitting and serving is equaled by a master\u2019s need to take control, to protect, to make someone happy.\u201d</p><p>She not only didn\u2019t believe him, but she also dropped her gaze again, shielding herself from him. Something else he would not permit. He set his fingers under her chin, lifting her face to his scrutiny, feeling the way she wanted to pull back.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t going to be easy for either of them, especially if she wasn\u2019t honest with him. Even worse, if he happened to misread her body language during a scene\u2014assuming the Overseer required one\u2014they could have a major problem. \u201cA purchased slave would not have a safe word to stop an activity because they\u2019re afraid, but I am uncomfortable without one. So, if you should say \u2018cramp\u2019 or complain of one, I will know you need a break or are having problems, and we will talk.\u201d He grinned. \u201cYet it won\u2019t look like I\u2019m giving in to something most owners would ignore.\u201d</p><p>The relief in her eyes appalled him. To feel grateful for the most basic of BDSM considerations. Well, they definitely had much work to do. He released her.</p><p>As he ate, she pushed her food around, her nervousness obvious in the way her eyes checked him constantly and her muscles tensed each time he moved.</p><p>Once finished, he leaned back, stretching his legs out before him. \u201cI have two basic positions I wish you to know right away. We\u2019ll work on the others later. The first is kneel, and you did very well with that one. The next is called display, and it\u2019s what I requested you to do in the dungeon.\u201d He raised an eyebrow.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStand up.\u201d</p><p>After a second of hesitation\u2014something else to work on\u2014she rose.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Leaning forward, he tapped her inner thighs to have her open her legs farther, and stood to adjust her position. \u201cHands laced behind your neck.\u201d He waited for her to comply.</p><p>Under his touch, she trembled, and her gaze dropped away. Curling his hand lightly over her shoulder, he waited to see if she was still with him. After a few seconds, her blue eyes cleared, and she looked directly at him.</p><p>The trusting had begun. He stroked his hand over her cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re very lovely, gatita.\u201d</p><p>Her brows pulled together, and she gave him a skeptical stare.</p> <p>\u201cDo not look at your master as if he\u2019s an idiot.\u201d</p><p>A surprised smile flickered over her lips.</p><p>Raoul drew his finger down her jawline. \u201cYour skin is beautiful and very soft. Touchable.\u201d He continued down her neck to above her breasts. \u201cYour breasts are beautiful\u2014full and high.\u201d</p><p>Her breathing stopped, her lips pressing together. But she maintained her stance.</p><p>He trailed his finger between her breasts, not pressing at all, so the fabric of her shirt kept his touch from her skin. When he reached her stomach, he felt the shiver even through the khaki material of her shorts and knew she was aware of him...as a master. As a man.</p><p>He said softly, \u201cYour waist curves in and then out to hips that were made to cradle a man, soft thighs to hold a man between them.\u201d</p><p>The color rising in her cheeks wasn\u2019t entirely from fear, yet it was far too soon to even attempt to touch her in any sexual manner. \u201cYou may relax. Hands at your sides, palms forward.\u201d</p><p>In all reality, pretty as she was, he\u2019d prefer to avoid it altogether. Nonetheless, every dom instinct in him wanted to act, to try to heal the damage, and as she was under his care, he must do what he could. So he would move slowly with small touches, verbal play.</p><p>\u201cNow, you will remember to ask to speak, no? If we are having a conversation, permission is understood. Address me as Master or Master R or Sir. Nothing else. This, I saw, you have already learned.\u201d</p><p>He noticed she\u2019d never called him Raoul either, even at Gabrielle\u2019s home. Did she think of him as the enemy then? Or as her master?</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cMost of your responses should be simply, \u2018Yes, Master\u2019, but if you\u2019re particularly enthusiastic, you may say, \u2018It will be my pleasure, Master.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Her expression showed doubt that anything he suggested could ignite her enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cYou are to care for the house and meals. A housekeeper comes in on Thursdays to stock the kitchen and do general cleaning. I\u2019ll introduce you, and you may take on overseeing her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll oversee someone else?\u201d</p><p>Her incredulity made him grin. She was so very unused to the dance between dominant and submissive. His lips tightened. And that was because she had experienced only the raping away of her power rather than the joy of giving it into loving hands. \u201cA slave might have clothes or not, speech or silence, no responsibility or much. Nothing is set in stone.\u201d</p><p>He held her gaze with his and could see her yield to his voice, his authority. Something constricted inside him\u2014she feared his control yet wanted it. How deep did her need run? Light submission...or complete? \u201cThe only consistency in the relationship is this: the master decides.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d Her shoulders hunched defensively.</p><p>\u201cThat makes you anxious, gatita. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t know... I need to know what\u2014\u201d</p><p>Did she fear arbitrary punishment? \u201cWe\u2019ll go over what I expect from you. The rules. I will never punish you for something you didn\u2019t know or didn\u2019t understand, Kimberly. That isn\u2019t my way.\u201d</p><p>Some of the worry faded from her eyes. But not all. Her gaze was focused on the floor.</p><p>He considered what he knew of her. Not nearly enough. \u201cI need to know...\u201d she\u2019d said. Needed to know what to do? Some people\u2014and a high percentage of submissives\u2014wanted clear-cut rules. Preferred their duties laid out, liked schedules and lists. He was somewhat that way himself, as were many engineers.</p><p>\u201cI think I understand,\u201d he said. \u201cTomorrow I\u2019ll list out your responsibilities.\u201d</p><p>The tensed muscles of her shoulders eased. The whiteness around her mouth started to pinken.</p><p>Much better. He added, \u201cAt breakfast every morning, we\u2019ll plan out your day.\u201d</p><p>There it was. He\u2019d won an actual smile.</p><p>Kim had been left alone to clean the kitchen\u2014 thank you, God\u2014and the time putting dishes in the dishwasher and wiping down the dark granite counters helped settle her nerves. She scrubbed at a stubborn stain, still a bit shaken by her reaction to Master R. When he\u2019d talked to her in that dark rich baritone, telling her she was lovely, talking about her breasts, well... Apparently her hormones hadn\u2019t gone into hibernation after all. Only she wished they had.</p><p>The thought of having sex ever again filled her with ice. And panic.</p><p>I\u2019m fine. Just keep my emotions calm and cool . She imagined picking up a heavy shield, like something Lancelot would carry. Nothing could get through it.</p><p>She stopped in the doorway of the TV room. Like the rest of the house, it had creamy stucco walls and terra-cotta tile flooring. The end tables and entertainment center were of dark wood, a waist-high brick red vase stood in one corner, and throws in autumn colors made the room cozy. A painting of a gorgeous old world sailboat hung over the leather couch where Master R was reading a technical magazine.</p><p>He glanced over and smiled. \u201cBarring any other instructions, when I am sitting, you will join me by kneeling at my feet, half-facing me, eyes down. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That\u2019s disgusting, her cynical part said. But her inner self...was silent. That wasn\u2019t right. Shouldn\u2019t everything in her disagree with subservience? A tiny shiver went through her as she knelt, grateful for the softness of the Oriental rug.</p><p>\u201cVery, very pretty, chiquita,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI\u2019d never planned to have a slave in this house\u201d\u2014he hesitated, and his jaw tightened for a second\u2014\u201cso most of the floors are tile and will be uncomfortable for you. If there is no carpet, you may use a pillow.\u201d</p><p>Had he owned a slave in a different house? She looked up, almost spoke. \u201cPermission to speak?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Add Master onto the end, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPermission to speak, M-master.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward and cupped her cheek, his brown eyes frighteningly serious. \u201cIt pleases me when you call me that, Kimberly. I thought you should know.\u201d He held her gaze, his look reaching deep, deep into her, melting the ice in her center.</p><p>She swallowed past a dry throat.</p><p>He waited, still touching her, his thumb stroking her jaw.</p><p>\u201cDid you have a s-slave before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmhmm. After college, I had a slave for about two years before I moved here. She preferred to stay in that city, so I helped her find a new master.\u201d The movement of his slightly rough thumb stroking her skin lulled her into relaxing...until his expression hardened, the warmth in his eyes disappeared. \u201cThe woman I married was my slave as well.\u201d</p><p>Kimberly pulled away. \u201cMarried? But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m divorced, gatita, for almost three years now.\u201d</p><p>The bitter twist to his lips made her want to pat his hand in comfort. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>He leaned back, putting more distance between them. \u201cThe usual things that break up a marriage.\u201d His voice made it clear the subject was off-limits. Pretty unfair considering the way he\u2019d probed her life.</p><p>She had one last question. \u201cDid your wife do all right once you let her go? After being a slave, could she still function?\u201d</p><p>The humor returned to his face. \u201cBecause a woman places her power in my hands doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019ll give it to anyone else. My wife was CEO of her own company. She ripped young executives apart without ever raising her voice.\u201d</p><p>Wow. That was... He was screwing with all her preconceptions. Pretty rude. \u201cAnd your first slave?\u201d Slave\u2014the word sickened her.</p><p>\u201cShe makes an excellent living as a real estate agent, specializing in million-dollar-and-up properties.\u201d</p><p>Not comforting to know he apparently had liked being a master and having a slave. But, oddly enough, it was reassuring that two women had willingly given themselves over to his care...without being kidnapped. Sold. \u201cThey cooked and cleaned your house too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, gatita, that\u2019s what housekeeping services are for. I only assigned you those responsibilities since you have nothing else to do. As it happens, I enjoy cooking and will take a turn on weekends, as I used to do.\u201d Amusement danced in his eyes. \u201cAnd when I didn\u2019t want to cook, then my slave did, wearing only an apron. As will you.\u201d</p><p>Oh boy.</p><p>\u201cNow, fetch the book you were reading earlier, and you may join me on the couch.\u201d</p><p>When she came back with her book, he didn\u2019t look up, just murmured, \u201cRemove your shirt and bra first, please.\u201d</p> <p>She stared at him.</p><p>He turned a page.</p><p>She\u2019d agreed to this. He hadn\u2019t wanted her to do it. But clothes were a...a defense. Her own kind of chain mail. I don\u2019t want to.</p><p>He appeared so relaxed, his attention on his reading. Another page turned.</p><p>Swallowing down tears, she pulled her T-shirt off, then her bra, and stood waiting.</p><p>He looked up then. His gaze ran over her, nothing in his expression except approval at her obedience. \u201cGood, gatita. You took a big step. Now come and sit beside me.\u201d He patted the couch.</p><p>She sat gingerly beside him, stiffly upright until he pulled her to his side. Her fingernails dented the cover of the book as she waited for the inevitable groping, the attack...</p><p>His heavy arm settled on her shoulders, and his fingers curled around her upper arm. He shifted, settling her against him more comfortably, and then picked his magazine up.</p><p>After a minute or two, he sighed. \u201cA slow breath, please, Kimberly. You are not running a race.\u201d</p><p>Oh. Her pulse pounded, but she managed to even out her breathing, from racing to maybe a jog. After another minute, she lifted her book. The room was cool enough that where his body touched hers felt...nice, warm against her bare skin. His hand occasionally stroked her arm.</p><p>Another minute or two, and she actually read a few of the words in her book.</p><p>When the little subbie leaned against him in earnest, her head nodding, Raoul sighed. He\u2019d known this would be difficult for both of them. He hadn\u2019t realized how terrifying it would be as well. He\u2019d dealt with emotional trauma before, since scenes tended to open a submissive to bad memories, and it was a rare human who reached adulthood without picking up a problem or two.</p><p>But she\u2019d experienced way too much trauma, too recently. Even worse, much of her turmoil was related to being enslaved, and everything he did would bring back those memories.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t going to be easy. During the afternoon while Kimberly napped, Raoul had a conference call with her counselor, Gabi, and Z, the owner of the Shadowlands BDSM club. Since Z was also a psychologist, he knew the emotional problems associated with the lifestyle.</p><p>Gabi, Z, and Faith had all had qualms over what might happen, but also some hope. The counselor thought patients with PTSD did better if they learned what caused their panic attacks and had help working through them. Gabi agreed and said that, in her experience, having a purpose\u2014like defeating the slavers\u2014was a strength and spur to confronting fears.</p><p>Unfortunately, they also agreed this FBI operation was moving too fast, especially since Kimberly would have to face the Overseer again.</p><p>Raoul sighed. He not only couldn\u2019t protect her, but would, in fact, often be the one giving her nightmares. Yet this was what she\u2019d chosen, so they had to make the best of it.</p><p>He shook her lightly. \u201cKimberly, it\u2019s time for bed.\u201d</p><p>She jerked away, the blank panic on her face tightening his throat.</p><p>\u201cEasy, gatita. You\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She blinked. \u201cBed. Right. Okay.\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cI mean, yes, Sir.\u201d She hadn\u2019t cringed this time, and the way she peeked out from under her long black eyelashes made him grin as he helped her to her feet and up the stairs. Resilient little chica, wasn\u2019t she?</p><p>Bed. Dios, another problem. He\u2019d have to do this in stages as with everything else. He let her go to her bedroom but waited in the hallway until he heard her return from her bathroom. The bed squeaked. He tapped on the door.</p><p>Her sharp inhalation sounded clearly. \u201cY-yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpen the door, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d she whispered. The door opened. When he saw the terror in her wide eyes, he almost gave up then and there. But she possessed more courage than he did, and after a hard breath, she lifted her chin. \u201cI bet I\u2019m losing my bedroom, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>The lump in his throat made his voice hoarse. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I think it best.\u201d She nodded, and her mouth firmed. Her hands fisted with her struggle to step forward.</p><p>So brave. He moved close enough to rub his hand over her lower back. Soft cotton pajamas. Comics, no less. Had Gabi chosen them? \u201cI see Wonder Woman looks worried also.\u201d</p><p>Kimberly gave him a confused look, so he ran a finger over the graphic at her waist. With her surprised laugh, the tight muscles under his fingers eased. For the moment.</p><p>In the master bedroom, he motioned to the bed. \u201cTonight, you may leave your nightclothes on. Tomorrow, you will wear nothing to bed.\u201d He paused. \u201cWhat do you say to me?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cYes, M-master.\u201d Another hesitation before she jumped up and onto the high bed. Raoul had bought it because it was the perfect height to take a submissive leaning over the bed. Not a fact he\u2019d share with her.</p><p>Kimberly buried herself under the covers.</p><p>In his bathroom, he cleaned up and donned a loose pair of cotton pants. After flipping the bedroom lights out, he joined her in the bed. Curled into a defensive ball, she was a huddled mass of misery, watching every move he made. She\u2019d never get any sleep that way.</p><p>He rolled onto his side and propped his head up with his hand. Would Z\u2019s suggestion work? \u201cOn a scale of one to ten, how frightened are you?\u201d</p><p>Kim frowned. The moonlight streamed through the balcony doors, a pathway of light, falling over Master R\u2019s face. No lust, no anger. He simply watched her with those quiet, steady eyes. She was grateful for how her loose hair fell forward and screened her face. \u201cWhen my mom had surgery, they had her rank her pain that way. You want me to use the numbers for how scared I get?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will do so, yes.\u201d He reached out as carefully as if she were a wild animal and, using one finger, pushed her hair out of her face, behind her ear.</p><p>So much for her shield. She barely kept from glaring at him.</p><p>His firm lips curved slightly. \u201cYou will not hide from me, gatita.\u201d He gave her hair a tiny tug. \u201cSo. I think you will show me your scale with your fingers. One finger tells me you are fine; all ten fingers extended means you\u2019re going into a panic attack. Use this starting now, so when we...entertain...you will not have to think, and we\u2019ll have worked out the best response.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cResponse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. If you get to\u2014we\u2019ll say seven for now\u2014I\u2019ll stop and hold you until you are steady again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d His plan shouldn\u2019t sound good at all, yet it did. Knowing he wouldn\u2019t ignore her fears helped. And she\u2019d already learned he had a comforting hug. \u201cSounds good.\u201d He deserved more than that. \u201cNo, it helps...M-master. It helps a lot.\u201d</p><p>He tsk-tsked and ran a finger over her cheek. \u201cThere will come a time when your tongue does not stumble over the word.\u201d</p><p>She sincerely doubted that, and her doubt probably showed in her face since he grinned, that mesmerizing flash of white against his bronzed skin. \u201cDo you usually sleep on your left or right side?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Darn it. \u201cOn my right. Sir.\u201d Especially after she got stabbed when her left ribs had been so tender. When his hand closed on hers, she realized she was tracing the wound.</p><p>\u201cThe right. Then turn over,\u201d he said. Ordered.</p><p>Her body stiffened until she felt like an unbending board as she rolled onto her right side. No. Oh no.</p><p>His arm slid under her head as he pulled her against his body, spooning around her. His bare chest warmed her back, his groin\u2014and a thickening erection\u2014pressed against her bottom. Her breathing hitched. No, oh God, please no. I can\u2019t. She couldn\u2019t move, as if whatever she did would incite him to attack.</p><p>A laugh rumbled through his chest. \u201cNo sex, Kimberly. However, before the Overseer visits, you must be comfortable with me touching you. And so your lesson is merely to accustom yourself to my arms, to being against me.\u201d A pause. \u201cYou will sleep better if you are not so tense though.\u201d</p><p>An awkward gasp jolted from her. As if she could control that?</p><p>\u201cBreathe when I do.\u201d</p><p>The man was breathing way too slowly. But she tried.</p><p>A minute later, he said, \u201cVery good. Now think about your toes. Relax the muscles in them. Let them go limp.\u201d</p><p>Toes? Get real. But he was being so kind. No sex. She wiggled her toes to remind herself where they were, to take her attention from the huge thing pushing against her bottom. Toes. Then she let them still, relax.</p><p>\u201cGood girl. Now your lower legs\u2014ankles and calves. Let the tenseness drain out onto the mattress, onto the floor. The bed will hold you up.\u201d</p><p>The exercise had her attention now. Right ankle. Left ankle.</p><p>\u201cGood. Feel how heavy your legs are, how they sink down into the mattress.\u201d</p><p>By the time he reached the top of her head, she was just awake enough to feel a gentle kiss on her hair, the soft exhalation of his breath, the firm arm holding her against him. And she let herself fall into sleep.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Raoul woke, feeling the pressure of time. The auction, according to the Feds\u2019 best guess based on their tracking of kidnapped women, would be in about three weeks. Sam needed to be referred before then and in enough time to get approved. When the Overseer made his follow-up visit, Kimberly needed to be well into the slave mindset, comfortable with him touching her body, comfortable with submitting to his will. If the Overseer had doubts, Sam\u2019s referral would get nowhere.</p> <p>At least, Kimberly wasn\u2019t an inexperienced submissive, even if she\u2019d never gone further than light erotic submission.</p><p>He smiled, inhaling the faint citrus scent of her hair, the fragrance of her feminine musk. But no perfume of arousal filled the air.</p><p>Kimberly was solidly asleep, her arms curled around his forearm like a stuffed toy, and... He frowned, realizing his hand had cupped her right breast during sleep. No, Sandoval. He released her\u2014regretting the loss of the soft roundness in his palm\u2014closed his fingers, and resettled his hand between her breasts. His cock ached like a torn muscle, and he sighed. This was going to be a long few weeks. And a very long morning.</p><p>At least they\u2019d both slept well. Her shivering had woken him once, but he\u2019d been able to soothe the nightmare away before it took her over. Better than the first night when her gutwrenching screams had dragged him from sleep. So much pain yet willing to face the Overseer, to save the other women. Her courage awed him.</p><p>He squeezed her slightly. \u201cKimberly, time to get up.\u201d</p><p>Her arms tightened around his, and her breasts enclosed his hand in softness.</p><p>\u201cDios,\u201d he said under his breath. He pulled away slowly and slid out of the bed.</p><p>She muttered and woke, pushing herself to sit in the bed, frowning at him.</p><p>\u201cSorry, chica, but I have work to do, which means you get up also.\u201d</p><p>Her frown deepened.</p><p>\u201cUse the bathroom to take care of business and brush your teeth, then call me.\u201d</p><p>She was wide-awake at that point, fear edging into her eyes. But she didn\u2019t argue, just moved into the bathroom.</p><p>He entertained himself by picking out the clothes she\u2019d wear today.</p><p>A few minutes later, she reopened the door, and he walked in.</p><p>After removing his loose pants, he stepped into the walk-in shower and turned on the water. The dark green tile steamed up immediately. Turning, he motioned her in. Her hands fisted at her sides, and she\u2019d started to tremble.</p><p>\u201cShow me a number,\u201d he said firmly, snapping her out of panic before it could take hold.</p><p>Oh God, he was naked. And fully erect, his cock huge and pointing toward her like a weapon. Her gaze dropped away immediately.</p><p>He\u2019d rape her now... Then Kim heard his voice, and a second later the words registered. A number. Ten, twenty, a hundred! With the exaggeration, her brain clicked back on. He wasn\u2019t hurting her. Not even touching her. Really, she\u2019d been more scared than this, hadn\u2019t she? Yes. And she was with Master R, not...a monster. With the thought, the fear edged down further, and she forced her hands open to show him six fingers.</p><p>\u201cGood. You did very well at making yourself think.\u201d</p><p>The approval in his voice warmed her far better than the steam from the shower. She forced herself to lower her head and wait for his command.</p><p>\u201cLook at me, gatita. This morning, you may remain in your pajamas...although you will join me in here. Today you bathe me.\u201d Silence.</p><p>Relief eased her breathing.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow we bathe each other. Understood?\u201d</p><p>A reprieve, not a stay of execution. But it still helped. A lot. \u201cYes. Yes, M-master.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cIf you are with me long, I will begin to spell Master with two M\u2019s.\u201d He held out his hand. \u201cCome, chiquita. Wash me so I can get some real work done today.\u201d</p><p>The brisk tone had her moving forward. His blunt fingers closed around hers, pulling her under the water. Warm spray soaked her pajamas, and they clung to her skin, hiding very little. He said nothing, simply handed her the soap and turned his back.</p><p>Well, okay. She worked up some foam and started. Impossibly wide shoulders, down the muscled planes of his back. Skip over his butt. His thighs were as thick as her waist, with light coarse hair. His ankles and feet solid. She stepped back\u2014the metallic taste had disappeared from her mouth\u2014and looked at him. There was nothing graceful about this man; he was sheer blunt power and strength.</p><p>His ass remained...and he didn\u2019t turn around. She eyed the soap. \u201cUm...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of me, Kimberly.\u201d</p><p>Dammit. Biting her lip, she washed his tight buttocks and between. So intimate, touching him there. \u201cT-turn, M-master.\u201d</p><p>His laugh echoed through the shower. \u201cIs this going to give you a permanent stutter?\u201d When he faced her, she could see the amusement in his eyes. Her tenseness retreated a step. At least until his erection bumped her stomach. She jerked back so quickly her feet skidded.</p><p>His firm grip on her arm held her up, but he released her as soon as she caught her balance.</p><p>\u201cWash my face, please,\u201d he said gently, the command forcing her to pay attention. The understanding in his expression made tears burn in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d She soaped over his forehead, the hard cheekbones, and the blunt angle of his jaw. His morning stubble rasped her fingers. \u201cRinse, M-master.\u201d</p><p>He stepped under the spray and back, wiped his eyes, and stood quietly as she soaped his corded neck, the steely muscles of his arm, tracing the line between biceps and triceps, his thick, powerful wrists. After washing each broad palm, she worked on his fingers, scrubbing thick calluses and short fingernails.</p><p>She soaped the soft black hair under his arms, then the inverted triangle of dark hair over his pectorals that hid flat brown nipples. His chest was a solid wall of muscle. Mesmerized, she ran her finger across the ridges of his abdomen. Damn, a real six-pack.</p><p>\u201cI like the feeling of your hands on me,\u201d he said softly, unsettling her so she paused to look up at him warily. \u201cContinue.\u201d</p><p>She averted her gaze from his groin and washed the front of his legs, his feet, and ankles. Then... Oh God, did she have to do this? But he wasn\u2019t touching her, grabbing her, or forcing her. A shiver ran through her as he stood in place, silently waiting.</p><p>Why did he have to be...erect? She stared at the wall, frozen.</p><p>\u201cChiquita,\u201d He lifted her chin. \u201cYou are learning to control your fear. In exactly the same way, an honorable man will control his lust. My body desires you, yes. Any living man would, and I\u2019m not dead, after all.\u201d A smile flickered over his lips. \u201cBut my body doesn\u2019t get everything it wants, or we\u2019d still be asleep in bed, no?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The logic made sense. He\u2019d rather have slept in but didn\u2019t. He\u2019d rather...fuck...her, but wouldn\u2019t. \u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Now wash me so I can begin work, and you can take your own shower.\u201d</p><p>Wash his cock. Got it. No problem. She looked down and gasped. How had she missed seeing that? \u201cYou have a piercing.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cSo I do.\u201d</p> <p>Oh wow. A silvery barbell with a ball on the top of his shaft went straight through to underside of the head. Straight through. \u201cDidn\u2019t that hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bit.\u201d</p><p>Uh-huh. A bit.</p><p>He clucked his tongue. \u201cKimberly? You\u2019ve been given a task.\u201d</p><p>Right. Although her fear had eased, worry constricted her chest. His cock was almost the same color as his skin, thick and long with a slight bend to the left. She gave him a quick glance as she touched it, tensing, half-expecting him to grab her and... But he just watched her calmly with a small smile. Her soapy hand slid around his shaft, slickly up...and she brushed over the metal on the tip. Circled it with a finger, then did the one on the underside. How would those feel...inside?</p> <p>\u201cMost women like it. A few don\u2019t,\u201d he said, answering her unspoken question. \u201cI remove it if it\u2019s a problem or sometimes for oral sex.\u201d He grinned. \u201cStop playing.\u201d</p><p>Realizing she was fingering the silvery piercing, she flushed. But now it wasn\u2019t as impossible to finish, from the head, down over the thick veins, to the springy trimmed hair at the base. He opened his legs. His testicles were large and heavy. Fascinating. She\u2019d had shower sex before, but had she ever washed a man so thoroughly? With this much attention?</p><p>When she finished, his face was flushed, and the muscles in his jaw had turned rigid. She knew that expression. Her body tensed, ready to flee.</p><p>As she took a step back, he turned and rinsed the soap from his body. When he faced her again, his smile was easy. He lifted her chin with one finger and brushed a kiss over her lips. \u201cThank you, gatita. Your courage pleases me.\u201d He gave her an infectious grin, and her heart skipped a beat at how dangerously handsome he was. \u201cYour soft hands please me as well.\u201d</p><p>Before she could worry about his words, he stepped out of the shower and toweled himself off. \u201cI left your clothing for today on the bed,\u201d he said a second before the bathroom door closed behind him.</p><p>He picked out my clothing? Excuse me?</p> <p>But she didn\u2019t really care...not right now. She stared at the door as the hot water beat on her back. I did it. Hadn\u2019t panicked. He\u2019d even thanked her. She touched her tingling lips. He kissed me. It had been...nice. Not horrible at all.</p><p>She started to pull her pajamas off and stopped. What if he returned? But...he wouldn\u2019t. She just knew that.</p><p>Raoul pushed away from his desk. His work was caught up, and the afternoon was almost over. So far, it hadn\u2019t been a bad day.</p><p>At breakfast, they\u2019d gone over schedules and expectations, then gone to their various chores.</p><p>After lunch, he\u2019d tried gentling Kimberly in the same way he would a wild animal\u2014start at a distance and move closer, bit by bit. While he\u2019d worked in his office, she\u2019d sat on a floor pillow beside him, close enough he could stroke her hair.</p><p>It had taken almost an hour for her to relax. When she\u2019d tired, he\u2019d leaned her closer, pressing her cheek against his thigh.</p><p>He\u2019d planned the method to increase her trust in him; what he hadn\u2019t expected was his own peace at having her close. When her psychologist had arrived and taken Kimberly to the great room, his office had felt empty and cold.</p><p>But he\u2019d heard Faith leave a while ago. Time for the next step. He rose and stretched, tucked his shirt neatly into his jeans, and went in search of his little slave. He found her still in the great room. Curled up on the couch, she appeared strained. The session must have been a painful one.</p> <p>Maybe she\u2019d enjoy his way of defeating stress. \u201cCome, gatita. It\u2019s time for something more vigorous than sitting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>She followed him silently as he walked to the front corner of the house. He opened the door and stepped into the room, then realized she wasn\u2019t beside him. He turned.</p><p>Almost as pale as her white T-shirt, she stood frozen in the hall.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, chiquita?\u201d</p><p>She moved a step closer, stared into the weight room, and sagged against the wall. \u201cI thought you were bringing me to a dungeon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d He shook his head. Poor little slave. \u201cI have a dungeon, yes, but it\u2019s on the south side. After we finish here, I\u2019ll give you a tour of the house.\u201d</p><p>Color returning, she followed him into the brightly lit exercise room and wandered around, looking at the bench press, the squat machine, the pulleys. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t know what this stuff was, you might think you\u2019d entered a dungeon.\u201d She eyed the cables.</p><p>\u201cI suppose,\u201d he said noncommittally, not even tempted to tell her how nicely some of the equipment worked as restraints. Attach that pulley to a submissive\u2019s wrist cuffs, add weight... A couple of the subs he\u2019d entertained actually preferred playing in this room to the dungeon. \u201cWe\u2019re going to build up your muscles and endurance.\u201d He eyed her loose shorts and T-shirt. Good enough for now. \u201cIn a couple of days, I\u2019ll start you on self-defense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know a little. My father made me take karate classes as a kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally. Why did you stop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d When she shrugged, her breasts moved in interesting ways, diverting him for a second. \u201cI...didn\u2019t want to be a tomboy anymore.\u201d Her mouth firmed as if she were remembering old battles.</p><p>Odd. Something else to investigate.</p><p>\u201cBut at this point, I don\u2019t think I could learn quickly enough to worry even a ninety-ninepound weakling,\u201d she added, her brows drawing together.</p><p>Had he ever seen a woman who was so pretty even when frowning? \u201cWith karate, no. I\u2019m going to give you the benefit of my years of street fighting. We\u2019ll start with some of the nastier tricks\u2014the ones they don\u2019t teach martial arts students, since explaining to a mam\u00e1 why her son\u2019s eyeballs are on the floor is most difficult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEw.\u201d She stared at him in horror.</p><p>\u201cOr why his few fingers now bend the wrong way.\u201d</p><p>Her disgust turned to a speculative gleam as she undoubtedly envisioned slavers who could no longer grip a flogger. Exactly the concept he wanted in her head. She wasn\u2019t a victim; she was a survivor\u2014and one who might do some real damage if the chance ever came.</p><p>An hour later, Kim\u2019s legs wobbled when Master R helped her off the leg extension machine. His hard grip on her arm was all that kept her from flopping onto the rubber mat like a landed trout. \u201cI won\u2019t be able to walk tomorrow,\u201d she moaned.</p><p>Dammit, why did he have to have such a great smile? \u201cYou will, although you\u2019ll groan all the way out of bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks a lot.\u201d</p><p>His laugh was deep, resonating in her bones. \u201cNow I want you to be clear on the rules we discussed earlier. When working together like in the weight room or cooking in the kitchen, I don\u2019t expect you to be formal. Everywhere else, you will ask permission to speak. You will use my title and be respectful at all times. If I am sitting in a room, kneel before you speak to me, and wait for permission to sit anywhere except the floor or on a pillow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, M-master.\u201d The same rules they\u2019d gone over at breakfast. No contradictions. Did he realize how wonderful his consistency was? She winced, remembering she\u2019d sat on the couch in the great room. He hadn\u2019t said anything. \u201cI was on the sofa before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d He frowned. \u201cMany masters don\u2019t let their slaves on the furniture at all, but I found that awkward and unnecessarily strict.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found.\u201d Every time he reminded her that he\u2019d had slaves before, the pit of her stomach dropped away.</p><p>\u201cIf there are no doms in the room, use the couch or chairs and be comfortable. If I enter the room, you stand. If I sit, you kneel. Any questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Sir.\u201d So she should have stood up when he came into the great room. \u201cIf you break the rules, you will be punished\u2014probably with a spanking. Is that clear?\u201d \u201cYes, M-master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good.\u201d He rubbed his knuckles over her cheek, his gaze tender. \u201cIs there anything you need now or want to say?\u201d</p><p>Why would a master ask a slave something like that? And why did it make her feel...off balance? \u201cNo, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo? Then let me show you the parts of the house you missed.\u201d He took her hand in his, leading her.</p><p>On the second floor were three guest rooms and the master bedroom. At the end, he opened a door and showed her a sitting room overlooking the ocean. \u201cThis is your private area for when you need a place to be quiet. If you\u2019re in here, I\u2019ll know you want time alone.\u201d</p><p>Before her relief had taken hold, he set a finger under her chin, lifting her face to give her a level look. \u201cHaving a space to use doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll be permitted to hide in here, Kimberly. As with all things, that is up to me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d His hand cupped her cheek, and gaze on hers, he lowered his head. A flutter like butterfly wings tickled in her chest, but she didn\u2019t move. A brush of his lips, a slide of his tongue on her lower lip followed by the nibble of teeth. Her mouth softened, and a tiny flicker of heat sparked to life low in her belly.</p><p>Not forceful. Gentle, teasing kisses from firm, velvety lips. His palm was warm against her cheek, his knowledgeable mouth on hers, but nothing else touched her. He didn\u2019t even try to push his tongue in, just led her, step by step, into responding to the kind of kisses she\u2019d experienced as a girl, before French kissing had come along.</p><p>He pulled away as slowly as he\u2019d advanced, his gaze still intent but...oh, so much warmer. As was she.</p><p>She stared at him, setting her hand over her quivering stomach.</p><p>The corners of his eyes crinkled, but he didn\u2019t speak, just ran his thumb over the moisture on her lower lip and then took her hand.</p><p>He led her downstairs to areas she\u2019d already seen. The foyer and great room, dining area and kitchen, TV room. When he headed toward the south side of the house, her skin went cold. His dungeon. No. I don\u2019t want to go there.</p><p>Ignoring the way she hung back, he opened the door and flipped on the overhead light, filling the area with brightness, erasing some of the menace. \u201cWalk around the room three times. Look at everything,\u201d he said in exactly the same tone as when he\u2019d instructed her to do leg presses.</p><p>Every fiber in her urged her to flee, but she took one step through the door. Her knees shook as she forced herself to continue. He didn\u2019t follow. She glanced back.</p><p>He leaned against the wall, arms crossed over his chest, just watching.</p><p>Okay then. Hands fisted at her sides, she managed to get one foot to move, then the other. The taste in her mouth, the way her skin went cold\u2014at age six, she\u2019d gone in a Halloween haunted house. Screams and moans, cobwebs and skeletons. She\u2019d frozen, unable to move until her furious and shamed father had dragged her out and yelled at her for being a coward. \u201cMoores are not cowards.\u201d</p><p>But they are sometimes . Yet she pushed herself on, across the empty side of the room, then toward the equipment. Her feet stopped. Breathe. Breathe. She forced her legs forward, tasting blood from where she\u2019d bitten her tongue. She made it past the St. Andrew\u2019s cross and a bondage table. Her stomach almost revolted when she saw whips\u2014so many whips\u2014coiled snakelike on a shelf. A glass-fronted cabinet displayed gags. Masks. God. Pass that one quickly. She came even with Master R.</p><p>He held up one finger. \u201cTwo more.\u201d</p><p>A throne chair with no bottom. A sink and counter. She detoured about chains dangling from the ceiling rafters. Then reached Master R.</p><p>Two fingers.</p><p>The room was well-equipped, nicer than some of the clubs she\u2019d played in. Leather padding on almost everything. A sawhorse spanking bench. Master Raoul.</p><p>Three fingers.</p><p>She stopped in front of him and shivered, thinking of all the horrible things behind her. Now what?</p><p>\u201cKimberly, we\u2019re not going to play today.\u201d</p><p>Oh, thank you, God. Her shoulders loosened as the tenseness disappeared. \u201cThank you, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHowever, I do want you on that. Facedown.\u201d He pointed to the waist-high bondage table, and she froze. He waited, then lifted his chin, his jaw hard.</p><p>Don\u2019t make him mad. She crossed the room, ignoring her inner coward that kept screaming, Run, run, run. After she climbed onto the table, she lay on her stomach, every muscle rigid with fear.</p><p>\u201cGood, gatita. You\u2019re conquering yourself and doing very well.\u201d</p> <p>He took her arms, laying them at her sides, and massaged her shoulders with strong fingers. As her muscles relaxed, she opened her eyes and craned her neck to look at him. No lust in his face, just the focused attention he brought to everything he did. \u201cSir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaster, gatita.\u201d</p><p>\u201cM-master, what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cMassaging all your tired baby muscles. What does it feel like?\u201d</p><p>Oh. \u201cNice.\u201d Except for the need to run away and hide. \u201cThank you. Master.\u201d</p><p>He worked his way down her body, and she knew he did it to get her accustomed to his touch, but it was effective. She tensed when he dug his fingers into the aching muscles of her buttocks, but he didn\u2019t do anything sexual at all. Down her legs. Her feet. She moaned when his thumbs dug into her arches.</p><p>\u201cTurn over.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes popped open.</p><p>He didn\u2019t wait but rolled her onto her back and smiled down at her. \u201cSuch big eyes. Yes, I\u2019m going to massage your front as well.\u201d His fingers curved over her shoulders, his thumbs digging into the muscles around the collarbones.</p><p>God, it felt good...but she couldn\u2019t relax, not with his hands so close to her breasts. He worked on her pectoral muscles, easing around her breasts, moving them out of his way. She tensed every time he touched somewhere new.</p><p>Finally he shook his head in exasperation. \u201cYour worries are getting the best of you, chiquita. You\u2019re not going to fall into pieces if I touch your breasts.\u201d And then he put his hands directly on her breasts, curving his palms around them.</p><p>Her breathing stopped.</p><p>He didn\u2019t move as he looked down into her eyes. \u201cAm I hurting you?\u201d He waited. \u201cKimberly?\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips. \u201cNo.\u201d Her feelings were too messed up to figure out. Fear\u2014oh yes. But...pleasure? She\u2019d always liked a man\u2019s hands on her breasts, but not now. Surely not anymore.</p><p>\u201cAre we okay?\u201d he asked. The firmness in his voice held the expectation that she\u2019d get over this.</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d He moved down to her feet, working his way up. Leaving her shaken. Always friendly, polite, yet this solid immovable core. More than his self-confidence and ability to give a command, he showed his certainty she\u2019d not only obey him, but that she wanted to.</p><p>And he didn\u2019t hide his satisfaction or even pleasure when she met those expectations.</p><p>His big hands squeezed one thigh and the other, moving higher until his fingers grazed the crotch of her pants with each movement. Her fear flashed and faded, leaving...anticipation. Warmth.</p><p>God, she wanted him to touch her. The realization slashed into her, more painful than a knife stroke. How could she live through rape and slavery and ever want to be touched again? What kind of slut was she? I really am the dirty fuckhole that the\u2014</p><p>\u201cTell me what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d he said. He\u2019d moved up the table to regard her closely with shadowed eyes.</p><p>Not ever. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGatita, I know when my touch heats a woman. Why does being aroused bother you?\u201d He waited; then his voice deepened in an explicit command. \u201cTell me now, Kimberly.\u201d</p><p>The words spilled from her like a dam breaking, releasing a torrent. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t ever want anyone to touch me. He said I was a dirty slut, and I am. I am.\u201d Sobs broke from her. A cunt, an animal, not worthy to be human. She knew it. Like a sewer, filth filled her, running through her core.</p><p>\u201cHijo de puta,\u201d Master R muttered and picked her off the bench. He cradled her to him as he carried her to the small living room.</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t touch her. She was not fit to be near a real person. Dirty all the way through. Tears streamed down her face, making her even uglier. A f-fuckhole and a\u2014</p><p>He sat on the couch, leaning her against his chest. \u201cStop.\u201d He shook her lightly. \u201cStop. Now.\u201d A master\u2019s voice. Her master.</p><p>She choked, pushing the sobs down.</p><p>\u201cBetter. You will listen to me. Do you remember how your memories work?\u201d Memories? \u201cWhat?\u201d She blinked, trying to focus on his face.</p><p>\u201cWhen something horrible happens, your brain doesn\u2019t process the memories right. It stores everything\u2014sounds, pain, smells, feelings\u2014all mixed up. It doesn\u2019t matter if you believed it or it made sense; it gets stored. Did Gabi or Faith not tell you this?\u201d</p><p>They both had. Kim nodded, her cheek rubbing on his chest. His scent came to her, clean as an ocean breeze.</p><p>\u201cSo if your memory is triggered, you get parts of the mess back\u2014and maybe what you heard or felt at the time. Are you listening, Kimberly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told you over and over that you were bad. Made you feel dirty. So sometimes, when your brain accesses those memories\u2014the ones you haven\u2019t thought about\u2014you\u2019re going to hear those words and feel that way again. S\u00ed?\u201d</p><p>She hauled in a breath. He was right. She didn\u2019t normally think she was a bad person. \u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabrielle told me she was raped when she was a teenager. Is she a filthy slut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Wonderful Gabi, who cared for everyone and brightened any room she entered. \u201cHow can you\u2014\u201d She bit her lip. Duh. And neither am I.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he murmured. He kissed the top of her head, then her lips, ever so gently. After picking up the TV remote from the side table, he said, \u201cLet\u2019s watch something really dirty. Like football.\u201d</p><p>As the Saints took on the Packers, she fell asleep wrapped in comfort.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Each day came with something new. Over and over, Kim had to remind herself why she was doing this. For the others. For Linda and Holly. And really...for herself, as well. To have a part in hurting the slavers, in wrecking their business, would be healing, would show that she wasn\u2019t a nothing, but was a person who needed to be taken into account. She struggled on. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She managed the loss of her clothing\u2014barely\u2014although she doubted she\u2019d ever get used to being naked when Master R was in jeans and a short-sleeved shirt. At least he allowed her to dress when other people visited.</p><p>Since he often conducted business at home, he and the FBI made Gabi and Faith wear shirts with his company\u2019s green logo so they\u2019d appear to be his employees. Gabi bitched about the boring white shirt\u2014and a matching green streak appeared in her hair beside the blue one.</p><p>Slowly, Kim got accustomed to Master R\u2019s hands on her body, washing her, massaging her, holding her. Each night, after receiving a good-night kiss that grew more demanding, she\u2019d sleep in the nude, curled in his arms, and wake with his erection pressing against her buttocks. He terrified her and made her feel safe at the same time, and wasn\u2019t that weird?</p><p>Each morning they\u2019d discuss her day and her tasks and anything else he expected. If she made a mistake in her posture or did something wrong\u2014like the drawer where the silverware went\u2014he\u2019d calmly tell her how he wanted it done. He didn\u2019t yell, didn\u2019t call her names, was always polite.</p><p>When she\u2019d broken a cup, she\u2019d frozen, expecting him to yell, if not punish her. He only told her to put shoes on before she swept it up.</p><p>The only thing that brought her close to being disciplined was rudeness. Being disrespectful was definitely one of his crash-and-burn offenses. But even then, he stayed calm. Consistent.</p><p>If only he\u2019d stop adding things she had to adjust to.</p><p>Yesterday, before lunch, the scum-sucking algae eater had buckled leather cuffs on her wrists. As she\u2019d tried to remember how to breathe, he\u2019d informed her he wanted tacos from his mam\u00e1\u2019s special recipe. By the time she\u2019d figured out all the spices\u2014like what was wrong with the little envelopes of seasoning?\u2014and had the meal set out, she\u2019d almost forgotten about the cuffs...until he clipped them together in front of her. Couldn\u2019t move, couldn\u2019t get away. Megaclaustrophobia. He\u2019d had to help her to her knees beside the table.</p><p>But as she\u2019d knelt beside him and he\u2019d fed her, her shaking had disappeared. Why did taking food from his hand no longer make her feel humiliated, but cared for? Because he selected the best pieces for her? Because his attention was fully on her? Lunch hadn\u2019t been so bad after all.</p><p>Today, everything had gone downhill... First, he\u2019d buckled the damned leather cuffs on her wrists after their shower in an automatic way that said she\u2019d be wearing them a lot. Dammit.</p><p>Fifteen minutes ago, he\u2019d given her his I\u2019m-going-to-be-mean-to-you smile and clipped the cuffs behind her back, held her while she panicked, and then frowned at her. \u201cYou will do squats until I tell you to stop. We\u2019ll build up both your leg muscles and your courage.\u201d</p><p>In the empty part of the weight room, surrounded by the scents of rubber mats and steel, she managed a few squats. Bending her knees, she did another and straightened up slowly. That was seven. How many more is he going to make me do? She scowled at him as the first drop of sweat rolled down her neck.</p><p>Ten squats...fifteen. Her thighs burned with pain. Drown him anyway.</p><p>Over by the rack of dumbbells, Master R was doing biceps curls. His pumped-up arms were huge. The way his darkly tanned skin stretched so tightly over the muscles made her fingers itch to touch. Besides, anything would be better than this squatting garbage.</p><p>He glanced over where she stood, her legs quivering until she was afraid she\u2019d fall. \u201cYou can do another, cari\u00f1o.\u201d</p><p>So not happening. \u201cWhat does cari\u00f1o mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means sweetheart.\u201d His lips quirked. \u201cNow stop stalling and push those spaghetti legs.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, drown him and let the crabs eat him, no matter how many affectionate things he called her. After hauling in a breath, Kim blew her sweaty hair out of her face, checked her balance, and bent her wobbling knees again. Down. She gritted her teeth and straightened. The cuffs didn\u2019t matter anymore, except if she fell, she\u2019d not be able to catch herself. Her thighs burned, and sweat trickled down her back and between her bare breasts. She stuck halfway up. Groaning, she pushed determinedly and made it all the way to standing, sucking air like a landed fish.</p><p>A minute later, as her breathing slowed, he said, \u201cAnother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn you, I can\u2019t. Are you fucking blind or\u2014\u201dOh shit. Oh no. Her breath strangled in her throat as his eyes chilled, and his jaw turned stern.</p><p>\u201cThat was very disrespectful, Kimberly. Do I swear at you?\u201d He didn\u2019t move toward her, but pointed to a bench. \u201cBend across the side of that.\u201d</p><p>No. She took a step back. Her heart had been fast; now it slammed against her ribs as if desperate to escape a cage. \u201cNo. Please. I\u2019m sorry. Master, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, chiquita. You will still be punished.\u201d He picked up heavier dumbbells. His left arm curled up slowly, straining, then down, before he glanced over at her. \u201cDo I need to repeat myself?\u201d</p> <p>No no no. Her feet felt as if he\u2019d clamped weights around her ankles. One step. Another. Her wrists were still restrained behind her, and her legs shook, making her stagger like a drunk. As she tried to kneel, her knees gave out and hit the rubber matting with a painful thump. Fighting tears, she pressed her bare shoulders and face to the cool bench padding. Naked. Restrained. Her pulse was an ocean of sound in her ears.</p><p>She turned her head and watched his reflection in the wall mirrors. He didn\u2019t pay her any attention. At all. His right arm curled up, down. The other arm. His concentration remained on his exercise, as if she\u2019d become invisible. She wished she had. Really.</p><p>The weights went onto the rack. Clank. Clank. Her stomach tightened.</p><p>He walked to her, his approach like the darkening atmosphere before a storm. Swinging a leg over, he straddled the bench beside her. She craned her head to see his face.</p><p>\u201cIf you are sent somewhere for punishment, you will take this position.\u201d He grasped her around the waist with merciless hands, sliding her forward until her hips met the edge of the narrow bench. Her head and shoulders hung down off one side; her knees barely touched the ground on the other.</p><p>His palm pressed firmly on her low back, and he set his foot on her calves. Immobilizing her.</p><p>A whimper escaped her as she tried to struggle.</p><p>He merely increased the weight on her. \u201cOnly three this time, chica. Count them for me.\u201d</p><p>Oh God, oh God, oh God. She tensed and heard him sigh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, gatita, but we both must observe the rules.\u201d His incredibly hard hand slapped her left butt cheek, not gently at all, and the stinging pain burst through her.</p><p>She jerked and gasped...and wasn\u2019t allowed to move.</p><p>\u201cCount?\u201d he prompted.</p><p>\u201cOne.\u201d</p><p>Thickening silence.</p><p>\u201cOne, Master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds much nicer, don\u2019t you think?\u201d His next spank landed on her right butt cheek. Sheer burning.</p><p>She yelped, and tears filled her eyes. It hurts. Her shaking increased. \u201cTwo, Master.\u201d Only one more. She could handle another.</p><p>The third swat was over both her cheeks on the under curve. The pain sheeted through her in a hot wave, and she sobbed, tears spilling down her face. Her bottom burned as if she\u2019d sat on coals.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Damn him. \u201cThree, Master.\u201d The fire started to fade.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you did wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cursed at you and refused your order. I\u2019m sorry, Master.\u201d</p><p>His hand rubbed her throbbing bottom. \u201cYes, I think you are.\u201d Then, to her horror, his palm moved between her legs and over her pussy, and when she tried to evade, she realized his foot and left hand still held her down. His ruthless fingers touched her, slid...slid between her labia, inside her and back out. \u201cYou\u2019re also wet, little subbie.\u201d</p><p>Her resistance disappeared like sand washed away on the shore. Filthy slut. Dirty fuckhole. Not worth\u2014</p><p>A stinging slap on her sore buttocks knocked the thoughts out of her head.</p><p>\u201cI recognize that look now,\u201d Master R growled. \u201cYou\u2019re a sensual, delightful woman, Kimberly.\u201d</p><p>The conviction in his voice smoothed the self-loathing away, but then his fingers ran between her folds again, teasing her entrance. \u201cYou\u2019re also submissive. I don\u2019t know if pain from the spanking turned you on today\u2014we\u2019ll find that out\u2014but we both know that being mastered is something you like. Something you need.\u201d</p><p>His fingers stroked her intimately, and a shudder ran through her as heat pooled in her lower body.</p><p>\u201cWe both know I will give you what you need.\u201d A pause. He cursed under his breath. His hand moved away, leaving her aching. He rose and walked across the room.</p><p>What had happened? With her hands still locked behind her back, she struggled to a standing position, grimacing at how her legs shook. He faced the blank wall, not moving. Was he mad? Had she done something? Only she hadn\u2019t. Like the tide coming in, anxiety flowed in and out, each time adding more.</p><p>When he strode back to her, his face hard with anger, she flinched...but held her ground.</p><p>His expression cleared. \u201cAh, chiquita, I am sorry. I\u2019m not displeased with you. Not at all.\u201d He cupped her cheek, infinitely gentle, his big hand hot against her chilled skin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She wet her dry lip. \u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m angry with me.\u201d His mouth tightened as he met her gaze. \u201cYou are...appealing, gatita. You\u2019re submissive, brave, beautiful. You give of yourself without holding back.\u201d</p><p>He really sees me like that? And yet... \u201cIs that bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am supposed to push you, but only so you can perform for the Overseer. For that one time, you must show your training, be comfortable in the role of my slave, comfortable with my hands on you, no?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, thinking back over the past week or so and... Damn, look at me. Restrained and spanked. Naked. Seeing a pissed-off master and not running for the nearest door. Her spine straightened a little.</p><p>His eyes lightened. \u201cYes, you\u2019ve done very, very well, and I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d</p><p>She felt as if she\u2019d swum into a sunny patch of water in a cold ocean. Wouldn\u2019t last, couldn\u2019t see the bottom, but so warm... \u201cThank you, Master.\u201d</p><p>He winced, leaned forward until their foreheads met. \u201cYes, that is the problem. I forget you are not truly mine. Kimberly, I should not have touched you so intimately.\u201d He straightened, holding her gaze. \u201cThere is no need for us to have sex for you to handle a visit by the Overseer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. There\u2019s not.\u201d Her surge of relief could have been expected, but not the regret. Yet she realized her body was coming back alive, belonging to her. Her pussy still throbbed, and under his controlling hands, she\u2019d felt beautiful. Sexy. Not a thing or an animal, but a desirable woman. Sex with Master R would be...scary. Maybe wonderful.</p><p>\u201cIt is part of a dom\u2019s nature to push. To give you what you need, to help you past your limits. But I don\u2019t have the right to do that to you.\u201d He turned her around and removed her cuffs. \u201cIt will not happen again, and I hope you\u2019ll forgive me.\u201d</p><p>God, had she ever heard a man apologize so sincerely\u2014let alone a master? He\u2019d bought her, was trying to keep her safe. That he felt so guilty now seemed wrong. She turned and clasped her arms around him, resting her cheek on his shoulder to hide how her treacherous tears were spilling over again. \u201cThere\u2019s n-nothing to forgive.\u201d</p><p>He sighed and wrapped her tightly against him, holding her for a long, happy minute. No one in the world hugged as well as Master R. After a kiss on top of her head, he grasped her shoulders to frown at her tears.</p><p>Wiping her cheeks, she managed a gurgly laugh. \u201cOn second thought, you can apologize for walloping me. I\u2019m going to have trouble sitting.\u201d</p><p>His quick smile was like glimpsing the sun on a cold, foggy morning. \u201cYou earned the punishment, chiquita. Now go swim a few laps in the pool to cool off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Master.\u201d As she started out of the room, he didn\u2019t follow. She hesitated. He hadn\u2019t even turned to watch her. His gaze had returned to the wall, and he looked...unhappy.</p><p>\u201cGatita, obedience is required,\u201d he said quietly without moving.</p><p>This time, she left.</p><p>On Wednesday, Raoul walked into the dungeon room. At breakfast, he\u2019d seen the calendar and realized it couldn\u2019t be much longer before the Overseer would call. The thought soured his day but reminded him not to let up on Kimberly. So he\u2019d told her they\u2019d play in the dungeon today.</p><p>What could he use that wouldn\u2019t terrify her? He opened the toy cabinet doors and frowned at the shelf where the gags were supposed to be. Empty. Madre de Dios. Eyes narrowed, he surveyed the shelves. In the row of nipple clamps, the wicked-toothed clover ones were missing. The next shelf had lost the midsize and larger anal plugs. The big dildos as well. The posture collar. In fact, anything that might cause a little slave some distress had disappeared.</p><p>His laugh broke the silence in the room and lightened his mood. Sneaky brat. Did she think he wouldn\u2019t notice the missing toys? Or had she simply not been able to deal with the nastier implements? He glanced at the wall. She hadn\u2019t removed any impact toys. Then again, he\u2019d mentioned he wouldn\u2019t flog, whip, or paddle her.</p><p>When she needed punishment, he\u2019d use his bare hand. As he had the other day.</p><p>Such soft skin. He remembered how his hand had left marks on her curvy ass, and his cock stirred. He shook his head. Touching her so intimately had been a mistake, not only in exceeding his promises, but also because he couldn\u2019t forget the silkiness of her bare skin and how wet and hot her cunt had been around his fingers. Her arousal despite her fears.</p><p>She\u2019d submitted so sweetly. She hugged him after his apology, showing a nature both giving and forgiving.</p> <p>And not mine. Keep that in mind, Sandoval.</p><p>However, it appeared he\u2019d pinken her pretty ass again today.</p><p>He grinned. Warning her of his plans for dungeon time had been a mistake.</p><p>Kimberly pushed a little farther back in the closet, feeling like a complete idiot. What have I done?</p><p>First she\u2019d stolen some of Master R\u2019s toys and hidden them.</p><p>God, she\u2019d only planned to check what was in the cabinets because he said they\u2019d use the dungeon today, and she...she needed to know.</p><p>Only there had been an anal plug, a huge one, and maybe if she removed it, he wouldn\u2019t notice. A dildo had joined it, and then her inner coward had come unhinged. She\u2019d filled a plastic bag with everything she didn\u2019t want him to use. And then hidden the sack.</p><p>How could she have thought he\u2019d be blind to half-empty shelves?</p><p>That was bad enough, but to hide. Like, okay, on her first day here, she\u2019d spotted this little corner closet under the stairs\u2014so very Harry Potter-like\u2014and also noted every single place a person might hide and all the exits as well. But she hadn\u2019t thought about any of them since.</p><p>Not until today when he\u2019d said \u201cplay in the dungeon.\u201d God, with every passing minute, her dread had grown. After hiding the toys, she\u2019d tried to clean the kitchen, to read, to do laundry, but her feet had carried her here as if she had no control over them at all.</p><p>Despair filled her as she heard Master R\u2019s footsteps. So distinctive. Not quiet or sneaky, but solid. Even. Unstoppable.</p><p>Get up, she told herself. Go out and beg forgiveness. Do it now. Her body didn\u2019t move. Her inner coward shrank further inside its cave.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t calling for her. Oh God. Was that good or bad? How mad was he? She started to shiver.</p><p>The door opened. Light shone through the spaces between the clothes. Surely he wouldn\u2019t spot her in the corner.</p><p>A grunt of satisfaction. His big hands grasped her arms and pulled her out of her hiding place.</p><p>She went limp, unable to stand, but he hardly noticed. He lifted her far enough to view her face and sighed.</p><p>Her trembling didn\u2019t stop, but tears brimmed in her eyes as she realized his disappointment in her. He wasn\u2019t mad, and that almost...almost made it worse. She firmed her knees, managed to stand, and earned herself a nod.</p><p>With one hand firmly curled around her upper arm as if he no longer trusted her not to run, he led her to the tower room. The place he liked to use for their talks.</p><p>He took the chair, pointed to the floor.</p><p>Blinking away tears, she knelt clumsily and lowered her head. Her throat clogged as the silence turned thicker. Heavier. A tear escaped. Another.</p><p>And then, as if a storm surge sent waves crashing over her barriers, she started to cry. \u201cI\u2019m s-sorry, Master. I...couldn\u2019t.\u201d Why didn\u2019t he hold her? The need for his arms pulled at her, shaking her like a loose sail in the wind.</p><p>He gave her only a touch, his finger lifting her chin. He leaned his elbow on his thigh and studied her. \u201cCouldn\u2019t what?\u201d</p><p>Couldn\u2019t face the dungeon, talking about it, seeing your disappointment. \u201cI\u2014\u201d She cried harder, unable to say any of it.</p><p>\u201cCarajo,\u201d he muttered, and she flinched at the Spanish F word. \u201cTell me\u2014clearly\u2014why you hid from me.\u201d He waited, offering nothing more as she struggled for control.</p><p>Her breath hitched, but she managed to whisper, \u201cI was scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI realize that. Why didn\u2019t you talk to me?\u201d</p><p>Talk to him? Her brain stopped as if it had floated to the end of an anchor line. \u201cI-I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>His finger stayed under her chin, keeping her face exposed to him. She blinked the water from her eyes, needing to see his expression. Hard...but not cold. He had on the you-screwed-up dom face, but he wasn\u2019t angry. Why isn\u2019t he angry?</p><p>\u201cHave I asked you to let me know when you\u2019re getting too afraid?\u201d</p><p>She tried to nod.</p><p>His eyes chilled.</p><p>\u201cYes, Master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI make you so fearful you cannot speak with me?\u201d She heard his unhappiness in his tone, in the slowness of his phrasing.</p><p>Her tears started up again. \u201cNo, Master. I\u2019m sorry, Master.\u201d</p><p>This time, he framed her face between his hands, using his thumbs to wipe the wetness from her cheeks. \u201cThen talk to me now. Explain so I can understand.\u201d Releasing her, he set his forearms on his knees and waited.</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t she gone to him? Talked to him before she got too crazy in her head? He always listened. He\u2019d hold her during panic attacks. He\u2019d go slower if she was really scared. But... \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking. I just hid.\u201d Had he maybe not seen the missing toys? God, let her have a chance to put them all back first. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He frowned at her. \u201cWhen you were little and scared, who did you run to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom.\u201d What did that have to do with anything?</p><p>\u201cNot your father?\u201d</p><p>Like he would have helped. Her laugh sounded...odd. She shook her head.</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>How to explain their family? \u201cHe... When I was younger, he treated me like a son. Boys don\u2019t get scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d His mouth twitched. \u201cThank you for letting me know.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open, and her brain started to kick in, erratic as a motor with some salt water in the fuel. Other fathers hugged their children...both sons and daughters. They\u2019d comfort them and hold them if a baseball smashed into them or when a big dog chased them. Her father hadn\u2019t been...fatherly.</p><p>\u201cAt first, he treated you like a son. What happened when you grew older?\u201d</p> <p>Her own fault. Her own choice. She didn\u2019t regret it. \u201cI decided I was female and started dressing like one. Helping my mother. So I was...nothing to him.\u201d</p><p>Master R was frowning again. \u201cYou would have been a beautiful little girl. How could any pap\u00e1 not be proud?\u201d His knuckles stroked her cheek, and she...yearned.</p><p>\u201cI guess you had a good father,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d His fingers ran through her tangled hair. \u201cKimberly. Terror can make us like children. If you didn\u2019t run to your father\u2014a man\u2014to comfort you, and considering your experiences with men recently, I understand why you hid.\u201d His level gaze held hers. \u201cBut, chiquita, you must understand that while you are here, I expect you to come to me and share your fears. Even if I am the one causing them.\u201d</p><p>Why did his uncompromising look make her heart stutter? \u201cYes, Master.\u201d</p><p>The corner of his mouth curved. \u201cI like all the Masters I\u2019m hearing right now, slave.\u201d</p> <p>She flinched, chilling as if arctic water was seeping into her core.</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cThis is the type of thing we discuss.\u201d He paused. Then his voice hardened. \u201cSlave.\u201d</p><p>He rarely called her that horrible word. Surely he couldn\u2019t understand the effect on her. How could he?</p><p>Now he expected her to talk as her insides shriveled like a jellyfish on dry sand. Can\u2019t talk. She pulled in a breath. Must talk. I\u2019m braver than this. Her shoulders straightened a little. Gabi would tell her to pull up her big girl panties and spit the words out. \u201cThe word. Slave.\u201d Could she bleach her mouth out? \u201cI never liked it even...before. Now it makes me sick to my stomach. Ugly.\u201d She bit her lip and forced the rest out. \u201cWhen you call me that, it\u2019s...worse.\u201d As if her security blanket had a snake on it.</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d He picked her up, tucking her easily onto his lap and against his chest.</p><p>Every muscle in her body relaxed at the enveloping comfort of his embrace. A reward. He was rewarding her for her honesty. Manipulative? Kind of. But she\u2019d take it.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look sick when you say master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the same\u2014not ugly.\u201d She rubbed her cheek on his chest; his faded T-shirt was soft over his solid pectorals. His masculine scent mingled with that of the laundry soap and had come to mean safety. \u201cI like the master word.\u201d She considered and added, \u201cAlthough sometimes I want to throw things at you when you make me use it.\u201d</p> <p>His laugh sounded different, deeper, when her ear was pressed to his chest. \u201cBueno. Is submissive better than slave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d She tried to imagine him calling her that. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of blah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. Perhaps sumisa\u2014or even sumisita? It means little submissive in Spanish.\u201d He shifted her so her face snuggled into his neck. \u201cSomeday we\u2019ll discuss why I think the word fits you.\u201d</p><p>Sumisita. It sounded...sweet somehow. He\u2019d called Gabi chiquita a couple of times, so that term didn\u2019t seem very special. Gatita was...more hers. And sumisita was more...ownery. His way of saying \u201cmine.\u201d \u201cI like that, Master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He tipped her face up. His approving kiss made her feel as if her boat had entered the harbor.</p><p>\u201cI put a blank journal in your sitting room,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd a limit list as well. You know what that is?\u201d</p><p>A list of BDSM activities where a submissive could check off what she might be interested in trying...and what she absolutely wouldn\u2019t do. Sometimes a club dom would hand her one. She nodded.</p><p>\u201cFill out the list, and we will discuss it.\u201d He tapped her nose. \u201cI doubt we\u2019ll actually play much, but we have reached the point where I need to know more about what bothers you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the journal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs mostly for you. Faith agreed you should use it.\u201d He paused. \u201cI want you to write one page for me every day, and we\u2019ll read it together each night. The rest is only for you; I won\u2019t ask to see the other pages.\u201d</p><p>A journal. Bleah. \u201cI get Faith\u2019s reasons. But why a page for\u2014to\u2014you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo avert problems like today.\u201d He stroked her hair gently. \u201cThere will be things you need from me. Thoughts you can\u2019t speak but might be able to write. So. You will fill the page, even if your words seem foolish to you. Clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Master.\u201d Homework. Frigging what-I-did-on-my-slavery-vacation homework.</p><p>\u201cSuch a pout,\u201d he murmured and kissed it right off her lips. His lips were warm, firm, controlling. His hand tightened in her hair as he took her mouth, punishing before he finished in gentleness.</p><p>Her head swam as if she\u2019d downed three quick drinks.</p><p>When he pulled back, his gaze smoldered with as much heat as she had simmering inside. His expression hardened. \u201cNow about what you took from the toy cabinet...\u201d</p><p>She buried her head in his neck. Oh God.</p><p>\u201cBring them here and lay out everything neatly on the ottoman. For your punishment, you will pick one of the toys\u2014just one\u2014which I\u2019ll use on you sometime in the next few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWrong response. Try again, sumisa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Master.\u201d More. She should say something more. \u201cWhatever Master wishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery pretty.\u201d He kissed the top of her head and set her on her feet. \u201cOff you go now...and, Kimberly?\u201d</p><p>Trying to remember what all she\u2019d taken\u2014that huge dildo, definitely don\u2019t want to pick that\u2014she turned. \u201cYes, Master.\u201d</p><p>His lips quirked as if he was trying not to smile. \u201cNext time when I say we will play, I do not mean hide-and-seek.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>A few days later, Raoul practiced in his dungeon with the door locked. Using a whip was a skill a dom couldn\u2019t afford to let grow rusty, not if he didn\u2019t want to mark up the bottom.</p><p>He\u2019d watched from the tower room as Kimberly walked on the beach with Gabi. The sun had glinted off his sumisita\u2019s dark hair. Her tan had darkened from her frequent walks, and her skin glowed with the return of her health. Kimberly had shoved Gabi into the frothing surf, her face alight with laughter. To see her so carefree lightened his heart.</p><p>And having her out of the house meant he could practice. Although the crack of the whip probably couldn\u2019t be heard outside the dungeon, he\u2019d take no chances. She didn\u2019t need to know how much he enjoyed bullwhips.</p><p>After stretching up until his arms and shoulders were loose, he started. An empty space on the wall held various practice targets\u2014today newspapers were between the wide clamps. He worked on slicing delicately through only the top layer of paper. At intervals, he\u2019d lash the adjacent piece of suede, checking that the cracker on the end barely raised the nap.</p><p>What was there about the crack of a whip that was so erotic?</p><p>His phone rang. After finishing his swing\u2014only a fool pulled a stroke\u2014he took the cell from his pocket. A private number. His gut tightened as he answered. \u201cSandoval.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaoul, it\u2019s nice to hear your voice. This is Dahmer...the Overseer. Is this a good time to talk, or should I call back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour timing is excellent.\u201d Raoul reminded himself of what must be brought up. The location. Referring Sam.</p><p>\u201cHow is the merchandise working out? Any problems?\u201d</p><p>Raoul forced a laugh. \u201cWell enough, although buying...used...wasn\u2019t my smartest choice. The previous owner left some dents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot surprising. The prior owner has a temper. But I\u2019m happy everything else is good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. In fact\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dahmer cleared his throat. \u201cPhones are\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a problem.\u201d Paranoid bastard, as Buchanan had said. \u201cI have a friend who admired the merchandise. He\u2019s rough on his playthings and hopes to purchase something sturdier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d A pause. \u201cWe do have an upcoming event. Perhaps if he qualifies, he might attend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d enjoy that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I did with you, I\u2019ll need to see your friend in action. It decreases the chances of...ah...unexpected visitors.\u201d</p><p>He meant cops. \u201cSpeaking as a buyer, I appreciate the precautions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a location you prefer? Your house or a Tampa club?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Raoul didn\u2019t want to foul his home with Dahmer\u2019s presence, yet taking Kimberly to a regular BDSM club with no safeguards in place was totally unacceptable. A few days ago, he\u2019d discussed an alternative with Buchanan and Kouros...and then Z. \u201cSince public clubs are noisy, perhaps you would be my guest at the Shadowlands?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Shadowlands.\u201d Dahmer paused. \u201cI\u2019d like that. The club has an amazing reputation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell deserved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout the audition scene you planned to do at this visit...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Raoul\u2019s hand tightened on the phone. He\u2019d hoped Dahmer would have forgotten. How to blow him off?</p><p>\u201cThe master scheduled to do the fireplay demonstration this month is unavailable, and I\u2019ve had difficulty finding fireplay scenes erotic enough for our buyers. Someone mentioned you give a fine show.\u201d</p><p>Someone. Would that be the bastard who had scoped out submissives from the Shadowlands for the slavers to kidnap? Raoul\u2019s jaw clenched. \u201cGood to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor your audition, I\u2019d like to see a fireplay scene with your new toy. If you do as well as I\u2019ve heard, I\u2019ll book you for the coming auction.\u201d</p><p>The coming auction. Raoul paced across the room, thinking. He wouldn\u2019t be on a waiting list. Since Sam might not be cleared as a buyer, this might be the best chance to get a person into the auction. But what about Kimberly? Raoul stared at the bullwhip and wished Dahmer was close enough to serve as a target.</p><p>If Kimberly could manage the scene in the Shadowlands, the FBI could find an agent to play his submissive at the auction. It might work. Agree now; back out later if needed. \u201cA fireplay scene it is. The Shadowlands is open Friday and Saturday. Which night suits you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me check my calendar.\u201d Silence. \u201cNext Saturday would be good. Ten o\u2019clock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. We\u2019ll meet you in the parking lot and go in together.\u201d Raoul punched the Off button. He tightened his grip on the bullwhip. A crack, and he slashed through every layer of newspaper.</p><p>Master R had been awfully quiet since yesterday, Kim thought as she took her beach walk. Was something wrong?</p><p>Had he gotten upset that she\u2019d retreated to her private sitting room right after Gabi\u2019s visit? But after talking some fears over with her friend, she\u2019d needed to regroup. Maybe Gabi had told him to give her time alone?</p><p>He hadn\u2019t seemed upset at supper last night. Just silent.</p><p>Still, before bed, he\u2019d read \u201chis\u201d designated page in her journal and laughed at her insulting description of his temper. He\u2019d hugged her for sharing how she felt like a piece of meat in the inspect position. So he probably wasn\u2019t upset with her. If anything, he\u2019d been gentler than normal. Sweeter. Snugglier.</p><p>Okay, she wouldn\u2019t worry until he told her she needed to. Instead, she took a breath, enjoying the tang of the salt air. In the distance, laughing gulls circled over something on the shore, squabbling and diving. Farther out, pelicans flew in a line, probably heading toward Clearwater.</p><p>The air off the water tugged at her T-shirt, blew her hair in her face, and lightened the humid heat a little. The wind off the Atlantic in Savannah was much more effective. She remembered the welcome ocean breeze when she\u2019d go out on the trawler with her father. Her father...</p><p>She frowned, remembering Master R\u2019s questions about him. Had she ever run to Father for comfort? Hardly. He\u2019d been a gruff man, dark in both nature and appearance. His Native American mother had gifted him black hair and wide cheekbones; his father had left him the fishing boat.</p><p>She shoved her hands into the pockets of her shorts. His life had revolved around the trawler, and until her rebellion, so had hers. But she\u2019d hated how horribly he treated Mom. \u201cFat cow.\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t do anything right.\u201d \u201cStupid as a stump.\u201d Mom had worked like a...a slave for him, and he never said thank you. Never noticed unless something wasn\u2019t perfect.</p><p>One day, Kim had yelled at him for calling Mom names. He\u2019d backhanded her into the wall. After that, Kim stopped pretending to be his son. She\u2019d gone out for cheerleading, worn makeup and pretty clothes. He\u2019d called her a whore and a stupid slut. God, she\u2019d hated him sometimes.</p><p>She stopped and frowned at a small sand castle. A red bucket lay nearby. High walls, a moat around it. No bridge. Smart kid. Keep the world out and stay within. Much safer that way.</p><p>Kim turned and headed back, shaking her head. Odd how she\u2019d hated her father, yet her mother never had. It had taken Mom years to regain her independence and stop doubting everything she did. They\u2019d both worked their asses off after he\u2019d died, drunk, in a car wreck. The stab of pain hit her unexpectedly. His life had been the stupid trawler, and when the boat had died, so had he. Mom hadn\u2019t been enough to live for. Neither had Kim. Hell, they were only women. Slaves.</p> <p>Not slaves. Mom was an office manager at a real estate firm now, and Kim was a marine biologist. So there, Father. We\u2019re better off without you. That hurt too. Mom should have...have left him, shouldn\u2019t have taken his abuse.</p><p>How could a wife suffer as many restraints as a collared slave?</p><p>Kim snorted. And gee, look at me now. I\u2019m a slave, just like you were, Mom.</p><p>When she returned to the house, Master R would put those cuffs on her wrists. And she\u2019d feel torn. Like she wanted them. Hated them.</p><p>She sometimes hated him too, but she was starting to want him more. Need him. She worked to win his smile, loved it when he laughed.</p><p>Don\u2019t go down that liking path, Kim. First, he was just doing what had to be done to get the slavers. Second, he\u2019d want his girlfriend to be a slave. That\u2019s so not me. So, Ms. Romantic, do not get attached. He\u2019s another team member like the FBI agents. Clear?</p><p>She looked up at the house and stopped.</p><p>Master R stood at the foot of the steps to the beach, leaning back on the railing, arms crossed on his chest. Just watching her.</p><p>That was nothing new, but the way her heart leaped... Now that was a problem. Dammit, heart, didn\u2019t we just have a talk? Weren\u2019t you listening?</p><p>She detoured around the weathered chair on the shore and paced toward him, trying to ignore the delight fizzing in her veins like frothy surf. When she reached him, she dropped to her knees, in exactly the correct position, and bowed her head.</p><p>\u201c Muy bonita,\u201d he murmured, stroking her hair. \u201cYou are so very pretty.\u201d He grasped her arms and lifted her to her feet with that effortless strength that took her breath away. \u201cNow, I need to talk with you.\u201d</p><p>Wasn\u2019t that what a man said to his wife when he was going to ask for a divorce? Honey, we have to talk? She grinned. At least, not being married, she\u2019d sidestepped that one. \u201cYes, Sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Overseer called yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe\u2014\u201d Her knees buckled. He tightened his hands on her arms and held her up, his brown eyes steady on her face. A cold sweat broke out over her skin, and her heart raced until her chest hurt, hurt bad. Maybe she was having a heart attack, and her air was all gone and\u2014</p><p>He shook her once, making her head jerk on her shoulders. \u201cKimberly!\u201d</p><p>She gasped in a breath, then moaned as her eyes fixed on the house. He\u2019d come here. Maybe he was already here. Her lungs squeezed down again.</p><p>\u201cLook. At. Me.\u201d Each word was accompanied by a ruthless shake.</p><p>Her gaze returned to his face.</p><p>\u201cThere. Much nicer.\u201d He smiled, the tiny lines beside his eyes crinkling. \u201cDid you know your nose is pink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you gone crazy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you gone crazy, Master.\u201d Still gripping her arms, he bounced her, obviously testing if her legs would hold her up. \u201cI\u2019m perfectly sane, thank you. Kimberly, we meet him at the Shadowlands next Saturday for drinks. For a civilized conversation. He\u2019s not going to run amok and slaughter the club members like chickens.\u201d</p><p>His bland tone made her choke on a laugh, but she gave him a dark look. \u201cSo little you know.\u201d Her legs started to work, and she stood under her own power.</p><p>He leaned against the railing again, clasping her waist and pulling her between his long legs as he liked to do. Why did that make her feel safe instead of trapped? His eyes were level. Intent. \u201cThere\u2019s something else, gatita. We will do a scene at the Shadowlands. A fi\u2014\u201d He broke off and said, \u201cAn erotic one.\u201d</p><p>She was the Titanic hitting an underwater iceberg. Hulled. Sinking into the freezing water. \u201cA scene?\u201d In front of the Overseer? The burn of anger\u2014of betrayal\u2014drove the ice away. She hit his wide chest, once, then over and over. \u201cNo. No. No!\u201d</p><p>His hands were still around her waist; he didn\u2019t move as she pounded on him.</p><p>Her fists slowed. \u201cNo,\u201d she whispered. She\u2019d agreed only to pretend to be his slave, not to do a scene with him. But then she saw the tightness of his jaw. Not anger\u2014unhappiness. She pulled in a shuddering breath. \u201cTell me why.\u201d</p><p>He curved his hand around her nape in support. Comfort. \u201cDuring my initial interview, Dahmer said they bring in people to do scenes for the entertainment of the buyers, and I thought that might be another way to get into an auction. The night I bought you, I agreed to an audition during the follow-up visit.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI vaguely remember hearing you.\u201d But she\u2019d hurt badly enough that their conversation was a blur. Vance had mentioned it at Gabi\u2019s house too. \u201cThere\u2019s a waiting list though.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem. He wants someone for this coming auction. If Sam\u2019s referral falls through, this might be the only chance to get in. I\u2019d use an FBI agent at the auction, not you. But next weekend\u201d\u2014his jaw tightened\u2014\u201cDahmer expects to see you.\u201d</p><p>Me. Do a scene. With the Overseer watching.</p><p>Master R started to speak, and she pulled away. \u201cJust...just give me a minute, okay?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, and she walked toward the waves. A few tiny plovers skittered in front of her, their bird feet leaving shallow tracks on the sand.</p><p>Okay, Kim, put it all in order. Neatly. First, he wanted her to do the scene this weekend but wasn\u2019t planning to make her attend the auction. Good.</p><p>The original plan had always been for the Overseer to see her. That was the point of the follow-up visit. Doing a scene with Master R wouldn\u2019t be that different, would it?</p><p>Only he\u2019d said erotic. That meant...his hands on her. Arousing her. She hugged herself against the cooling breeze. He\u2019d been touching her, washing her. Intimate but never sexual. He often kissed her. I do pretty good with all that.</p><p>Actually, sometimes she almost wanted more, but then she\u2019d freeze. Really, she just wanted to stay celibate and icicle cold for a while. A few years.</p><p>If Master R refused to audition, how could he justify it? They\u2019d be at a BDSM club. And she\u2019d be there. No excuse came to mind, since no slaver would care if his property had the jitters.</p><p>She scuffled the sand over her toes, letting the warmth sink into her skin. Could she do this?</p><p>Well, a lot of her fears concerned the Overseer, but she\u2019d put those in a mental box. Stay closed, box. So what was really bothering her?</p><p>She stared at the rain clouds forming into a mass. Her nerves were because Master R would be touching her. Deliberately trying to arouse her. In front of people. The Overseer.</p><p>He\u2019d never gone sexual on her before\u2014what if she panicked? Let him down? It\u2019d almost...almost be easier if he\u2019d actually done some of that intimate stuff, like that day in the weight room. She shivered, remembering the feel of his fingers between her legs, pushing inside her. She\u2019d been wet.</p><p>The waves lapped at her toes as she walked. She watched how the water gave way to her feet, and yet the same substance carved canyons in the earth. Strength could be found in the determination to get where a person needed to go. In just keeping on.</p><p>I need to go home, and that means I need the slavers in jail. She had to keep on.</p><p>Master R was still waiting when she walked back to him. He waited even longer for her to speak.</p><p>\u201cI understand why we should do the scene.\u201d She swallowed, tasting the briny air. \u201cI\u2019m scared I might panic.\u201d</p><p>His eyes filled with tenderness. \u201cIs there anything that would help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019d better...touch me some. Before.\u201d Her face heated, her blush a dead giveaway as to what she meant. Six days until then. Maybe she\u2019d be ready.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re probably right.\u201d His lips curved, and he stroked a finger down her hot cheek. \u201cIt will be my pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Oh boy.</p><p>Kimberly bent over, trying to catch her breath, sweat dripping from her face and trickling between her bare breasts. Her sadistic, nasty master had increased the length of her workout today, for which she was maybe a little grateful. Since yesterday when he\u2019d told her about the Shadowlands scene, the hours dragged as if to build her dread to a mountain she couldn\u2019t climb. Over breakfast, Master R had assigned her a long list of tasks and complicated meals. He obviously planned to keep her too busy to think. He\u2019d even put her to work in his home office this morning.</p> <p>Major eye-opener. With such a beautiful beach house, he couldn\u2019t be poor, but the dom owned an international engineering company. When she wondered how he could take so much time off, he smiled and said if employees couldn\u2019t handle the work, why hire them?</p><p>She was grateful he worked from here. Knowing he was in the house let her relax. His calmness helped too. He never got frazzled. Not that he was particularly easygoing\u2014 his Latin temper showed, especially when they talked about the slavers.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t worry about little stuff or things he couldn\u2019t do anything about.</p><p>She was a worrier. And worse, she wanted to do things perfectly so she could get approval from\u2014she scowled\u2014from her father and everyone else.</p><p>Master R didn\u2019t expect perfection from her. Just her best, and he\u2019d push her until he got it.</p><p>In his office, he had a framed calligraphy on the wall. \u201cStrive for perfection in everything you do. Take the best that exists and make it better. When it does not exist, design it.\u201d Sir Henry Royce. Yeah, that was so her master who was also an engineer.</p><p>He never made her guess if she\u2019d pleased him. If she did, he showed it. If she didn\u2019t, he told her how to do better. She never had to worry about clothes or her performance or even what to do next.</p><p>Or how to deal with...interpersonal relations.</p><p>Dating had always been a nightmare. From questions of clothing: What should I wear to look pretty but not like a slut. Should I dress up? Or would it be better to look casual?</p><p>To behavior: Should I touch him? Let him hold my hand? Ask him in for a drink, or would he think I\u2019m easy? Sleep with him on the second or third date or not? Let him grope my ass on the dance floor, or does that make me look like a slut?</p><p>But here, Master R picked out her clothes\u2014or made her stay naked. Choice over.</p><p>For behavior? He decided what he wanted from her and said so. No decisions to make. That was so restful.</p><p>And boy, he definitely decided how interpersonal stuff would go. Last night, he\u2019d pushed her into the pool. When she\u2019d surfaced, trying not to spit curses at him, he\u2019d said they\u2019d play tag. Every time she caught him, she could claim a kiss. If she took too long to catch him, he\u2019d spank her. Great incentive.</p><p>Chasing after him\u2014and he didn\u2019t make it easy\u2014made touching fun. Not scary. After she caught him a few times, she was definitely aroused. Damn, the man could kiss. Then he upped the stakes to \u201ccopping a feel,\u201d only whenever she put her hands on him, he duplicated her movements, putting his hands on her. She was giggling and hot and\u2014</p><p>\u201cStop daydreaming and do it all again.\u201d Master R\u2019s sexy baritone made her straighten.</p><p>He was lying on the weight bench and not even looking at her. His dom radar always told him when she slacked off. Drown him in high seas anyway.</p><p>She watched him push the bar up. Giant metal plates clanked on each end, and his chest muscles and biceps bunched and turned to granite under his tank. God, she could almost see testosterone oozing from his pores instead of sweat.</p><p>\u201cKimberly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Master.\u201d She launched into the last street-fighting combination he\u2019d taught her. Block, knuckles to the Adam\u2019s apple, other hand\u2014fingers to the eyes. One-two. She saw the fat guard on the floor, screaming in pain. She did it again. And again.</p><p>Until she tripped and landed on her hands and knees. \u201cSuck water,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cThe last move appeared a bit clumsy.\u201d Lying on his back, he was watching.</p><p>She giggled and sat her bare butt on the rubber matt, pushing back the hair that had escaped her braid. \u201cHow come you\u2019re so good at all this? You said from street fighting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re stalling.\u201d But he sat up, wiping his forehead with the towel. \u201cWe lived in a rough area when I grew up. When my brother joined a gang, he taught me what he learned from them.\u201d</p><p>Brother? She frowned. He\u2019d talked of a sister and his mother. \u201cI don\u2019t remember you mentioning a brother.\u201d</p><p>His face\u2014so sad. Before she considered, she\u2019d joined him on the bench. She put her arms around him and then froze, thinking she\u2019d overstepped her bounds.</p><p>But he pulled her in, holding her tightly, his cheek against the top of her head. After a minute, he sighed. \u201cThank you, gatita. I needed a hug.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d She stayed, not letting go.</p><p>Raoul didn\u2019t want to talk about the past. Not in the least. The ache of loss\u2014of guilt\u2014never went away.</p><p>\u201cIt still bothers you.\u201d She rubbed her head on his shoulder. Naked little submissive trying to comfort her master\u2014she awed him with her courage and care. \u201cShare with me, Master.\u201d</p><p>Share. She wanted openness. Honesty. They might be doing this to capture the slavers, but the bond of trust between them was real. He\u2019d required she share her emotions and had pushed her to tears when needed. He could give her no less in return.</p><p>\u201cHe died.\u201d His arms tightened for a second, before he regained control. \u201cHe was only fifteen. I was twelve and thought he was God and followed him everywhere.\u201d Mam\u00e1 had yelled at Manuel, told him gangs were bad. \u201cHis gang was outnumbered in a street fight with another gang. Manuel told me to hide.\u201d Raoul had obeyed, then peeked out from the pile of empty grocery boxes, the stench of rotted fruit surrounding him, his heart hammering enough to choke him.</p><p>\u201cTwelve. God, you were a baby.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He frowned. \u201cOld enough. I should have\u201d\u2014 forced Manuel to leave, gotten the cops, fought beside him\u2014\u201cThree of them attacked Manuel.\u201d They seemed huge, knives flashing, yelling curses in Spanish. A knife opened Manuel\u2019s arm, his T-shirt ripping, red running down his wrist. Raoul hit the knife-wielder from behind, knocking the boy to his knees. But another backhanded him like a fly into the garbage. \u201cI tried. Dios, I tried to get them away from him.\u201d Scrambling up, punching, kicking, it was as if he wasn\u2019t even there. They\u2019d surrounded Manuel, cutting him from behind every time he turned to fight one. Raoul yelled, grabbed a gangster\u2019s arm, bit down. \u201cThey knocked me away, concentrating on him. Nothing I did helped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have been that big, not at twelve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkinny. Weak. I liked books. I was useless to him.\u201d He\u2019d crawled back the last time, crying, grabbing one\u2019s leg, and hanging on. Manuel had stabbed that one. Raoul had felt the blow through the gangster\u2019s body, the shudder of pain. When he tried to scramble away, a brutal kick in the gut laid him out. He couldn\u2019t breathe. More came, stepping on him on the way past. He\u2019d heard his brother scream. That high scream\u2014not a man\u2019s voice. So young. Too young. \u201cBy the time I got to my feet, Manuel was dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s horrible. You were only babies. But you tried to help.\u201d</p> <p>Blood everywhere. So many cuts. He\u2019d failed his brother. Been useless. Weak. Never again. Once his injuries had healed, he\u2019d traded his bike for a set of weights.</p><p>Her arms clamped around him, holding him as if she could keep him together, her fears pushed aside. Sweet gatita. He rubbed his cheek in her soft hair and said, \u201cSo I know how it feels to be weaker, sumisita, and not able to fight back. When I got my first job, my money went for self-defense lessons. I searched for the nastiest street-fighting teachers I could find.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019re teaching me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat and getting you strong enough to use it.\u201d</p><p>She pulled back, glancing around the weight room. \u201cYou work out almost every day. Does that mean you still feel guilty, like you let him down?\u201d</p> <p>He stiffened at her slicing accuracy. \u201cMaybe.\u201d He hadn\u2019t been able to save, to protect. \u201cS\u00ed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such an idiot!\u201d She shook him, actually shook him. \u201cYou were twelve. And outnumbered. Even if you\u2019d been huge, could you really have won?\u201d</p><p>Raoul frowned. Looking at the fight from a more experienced viewpoint, he knew there had been too many. No matter what he might have done, they\u2019d have killed Manuel. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She rubbed her cheek on his shoulder. \u201cYou know, if you\u2019d been older, they\u2019d probably have killed you. Your mom would have lost two sons.\u201d</p><p>A clever blow. His mam\u00e1\u2014bearing the death of one child had been enough. Raoul sighed. He doubted the guilt would go away completely, but it had lightened. He stroked a finger down her cheek. \u201cThank you, gatita. For the hug...and the insight.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him. The tears in her eyes were for him and Manuel.</p> <p>Had he ever known anyone as sweet? However... \u201cYou still have to practice for another fifteen minutes.\u201d</p><p>Her sigh was expressive.</p><p>Trying not to grin, he kissed her pouting lips. \u201cNo more stalling.\u201d</p><p>Before starting each set of blocks and strikes, Kim visualized her opponent. For the first time, Lord Greville and the Overseer had company, ugly street toughs who\u2019d kicked a little twelve-year-old. Killed his brother. Who\u2019d left him with so much guilt it radiated like heat waves from him. Scum-sucking jerkwads. She worked out silently, furiously, until she had to put her hands on her knees and pant to get her breath back.</p><p>A chuckle. Master R pointed to the bare floor around her. \u201cI think they are all dead, gatita. Good job.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cThank you. I\u2019m ready for a new set of\u2014\u201d</p><p>The doorbell rang.</p><p>Shaking his head at the way she\u2019d frozen in place, Master R said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, cari\u00f1o.</p> <p>It\u2019s only a special messenger delivering your clothes for this weekend.\u201d He pointed at the shorts and loose top she\u2019d worn for Faith\u2019s visit. \u201cPut those on and come out and meet him.\u201d Him. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d Her voice shook, and she bit her lip.</p><p>He didn\u2019t give her trouble over questioning him. \u201cYou\u2019ve got two minutes to dress. We\u2019ll be in the great room.\u201d After tugging on her braid, he walked out.</p><p>Two minutes? She wiped down with a towel and dragged on her clothing, then hurried down the hall. Master R had taken his usual seat on the big leather sofa. A dark-haired man sat across from him. Expensively tailored black slacks and black silky shirt. A little older, maybe forties. He rose as she entered.</p><p>\u201cZ, sit down,\u201d Master R chided. \u201cShe\u2019s in training.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed, I forgot.\u201d The man smiled and resumed his seat.</p><p>Staying well out of the stranger\u2019s reach, Kim sidled over to Master R. She knelt very, very gracefully at his feet and lowered her head. He made the tiny noise he used for approval, and she relaxed.</p><p>\u201cZ, this is Kimberly.\u201d Master R stroked her hair. \u201cGatita, this is Master Z. He owns the Shadowlands and is Jessica\u2019s master.\u201d</p><p>Oooh, this was the creative dom who managed to keep feisty Jessica in line. She looked up and had to wonder if the silvering hair at his temples had been caused by his sub.</p><p>He studied her in turn, his gray eyes seeming to slide into her soul. She pressed closer to Master R\u2019s legs. \u201cYou\u2019re doing very well,\u201d he told Master R, which seemed strange since she hadn\u2019t done anything to elicit his opinion.</p><p>\u201cI hear you\u2019re visiting my Shadowlands this weekend, little one. I brought you a present.\u201d With a faint smile, he held a brown paper bag out to her.</p><p>A present? She started to reach for it, paused, and glanced at Master R first. He nodded permission, so she rose and brought the package back and then knelt again.</p><p>\u201cOpen it,\u201d Master R said.</p><p>A present. She gave the strange dom a suspicious look. If this is a flogger, I\u2019m heading for the bathroom and locking the door.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a flogger. She pulled out a very short silk satin dress, black with white lace at the bottom and top. A tiny heart-shaped white apron. What the...? Hey, he\u2019d brought her a French maid\u2019s costume. A pricey one.</p><p>Master R checked the bag and removed white fishnet stockings. \u201cNice.\u201d His smile included her as he told Z, \u201cNeither of us was comfortable with her being naked in front of the Overseer. This should work perfectly.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes stung, and she hastily lowered her head. She hadn\u2019t told Master R, but the dread of that had made her sick a couple of times. The maid\u2019s outfit was skimpy, but even a small amount of clothing made a difference. Master R had known. He\u2019d felt that way too. A breath. Two. She managed to give her thanks to Master Z.</p><p>His gray eyes softened. \u201cYou\u2019re very welcome, Kimberly.\u201d He turned his gaze back to Master R. \u201cI brought something else. I understand you might not be comfortable with this, but I believe it\u2019s necessary.\u201d He handed a second bag to Master R.</p><p>Master R opened it, and his jaw tightened until she could see the rigid tendon in his cheek. He stared at the other man.</p><p>Oh boy. Kim didn\u2019t move a muscle. If he turned that look on her, she\u2019d melt into a terrified puddle on the floor.</p><p>Master Z merely chuckled. \u201cIt\u2019s just leather, Raoul. And if you\u2019re not going to go with a standard naked slave, you need to make your ownership very clear. Kimberly, what do you think?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d asked her a question? She peeked at Master R.</p><p>His fury had disappeared, leaving weariness behind. He upended the bag over the coffee table and a variety of...of slave collars spilled out. Studded dog collars, ones with D-rings and chains, thinner ones with padlocks, a thick silver one that looked horribly uncomfortable, a dark red leather, a black leather with silver decorations.</p><p>Never. The thought of one going around her neck made her stomach turn over. Never. Absolutely never would she let... Her thoughts jerked to a halt. \u201cMake your ownership very clear,\u201d Master Z had said. The Overseer would be at the Shadowlands. Looking at her. But no one touched a collared master\u2019s slave.</p><p>She swallowed, straightened her shoulders, and faced Master R. \u201cI think I\u2019d like to make it obvious to everyone\u2014to h-him\u2014that you own me.\u201d She laid her fingers on the black leather collar, feeling as if she touched a snake. \u201cThis would go best with the outfit.\u201d</p><p>Master R watched her for a second, eyes dark and unreadable, then gave Master Z a cold look. \u201cHijo de puta.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Raoul.\u201d Z glanced at his watch and rose. \u201cMy time\u2019s up, and I have an appointment.\u201d He smiled at Master R. \u201cAs we tell our subs all too often, what you want and what you need aren\u2019t necessarily the same thing.\u201d</p><p>Master R walked him out and returned, the cold still in his eyes.</p><p>Kimberly tried not to flinch. If he was mad, she wouldn\u2019t be able\u2014</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, looking down at her. \u201cMy anger is from the past and nothing to do with you. Why don\u2019t you run upstairs and shower? Take some time for yourself.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d She rose and bowed her head. \u201cThank you, Master, for your care.\u201d</p><p>He made a noise as if she\u2019d slapped him instead of thanking him. Then he sighed and stroked her hair. \u201cGo, sumisita.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>On Tuesday, muggy evening air formed a damp cloak over Raoul\u2019s skin as he took a seat on the patio. The outdoor lights flickered on, and the pool turned a clear blue around the young woman swimming laps. Kimberly looked strong and healthy. And she was never happier than when near the water. That was why he\u2019d created erotic pool tag for her, and why their protracted make-out time last night had been on the beach.</p><p>He stretched his legs out. Aside from scenes in the club, how long had it been since he\u2019d kissed and fondled a woman without making love to her later? Years? Even longer since he\u2019d been so uncomfortable he had to jerk off in the shower. But his gatita had a stronger effect on him than any woman before.</p><p>She\u2019d become nicely hot last night. He\u2019d concentrated on her breasts, venturing lower at times. Over the past weeks, she\u2019d become accustomed to his hands, but not to having him deliberately arousing her. When she\u2019d started to panic, he\u2019d stopped and held her, and she\u2019d quieted. She looked to him for comfort now, and that pleased him...perhaps too much. He shouldn\u2019t get attached to this woman. When the slavers were no longer a threat, she\u2019d return to her own life.</p><p>It would be difficult to let her go. He liked having her curled in his arms, showering with her, teaching her weight lifting and fighting. She was as affectionate and fun as the kitten he called her, and her need to give was spiced with a delightful temper.</p><p>She\u2019d changed in her time with him. As she\u2019d grown comfortable with his commands, she\u2019d also acquired a submissive\u2019s trait of always being aware of her master, as he was aware of her. He\u2019d forgotten the beauty of the constant perception between a dominant and his submissive.</p><p>Because of Alicia. His mouth flattened at the bitter taste brought by the memory of his marriage. He and Alicia had been happy at first, master and slave. Things had changed. Much was his fault. Having had a slave before, he knew\u2014thought he knew\u2014what a relationship required. Too in love to be cautious, he\u2019d yielded to Alicia\u2019s pleas and jumped right in. Husband and master.</p><p>But he hadn\u2019t married a slave.</p><p>With one hand on the edge of the pool, Kimberly stopped to catch her breath. She saw him watching, waited a second in case he wanted her, then launched into another lap. Determined little submissive.</p><p>Alicia hadn\u2019t been submissive at all. New to BDSM, she hadn\u2019t realized that submission didn\u2019t punch her buttons; pain did. After they figured it out, he hadn\u2019t tried to continue as her master, but had hoped they could still have a good life together. Foolish Sandoval.</p><p>And when she\u2019d betrayed him, she\u2019d changed his memories of what had been good into something ugly. Then she\u2019d gone one step further and turned his family against him by revealing his lifestyle.</p><p>Raoul tilted his head back. The setting sun was a red gleam along the horizon, disappearing as if washed away by the waves. A shame that memories didn\u2019t disappear so easily. Eventually...someday...he\u2019d get into a Dominant/submissive relationship, would love someone again. But, like a ripped muscle, his desire to launch into a new relationship had been weakened, wasn\u2019t ready to bear the burden. Until then, he was content with the casual relationships he had with various submissives.</p><p>The streak of light slowly disappeared, leaving only gray ocean meeting the dark sky.</p><p>A splash drew his gaze to where Kimberly had climbed out of the pool. She dried herself off and came over to kneel at his feet, cleverly bringing the towel to protect her knees from the concrete. Smart gatita. Her eyes were down, her body relaxed.</p><p>He smiled in satisfaction. Her first week she\u2019d been constantly braced for a blow. Now her fears appeared in response to something new he proposed, but not until then. She trusted him.</p><p>Yes, he would miss her. It was good she wouldn\u2019t be with him much longer.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a bottle of wine chilling in the refrigerator,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you bring it into the living room? Two glasses. We\u2019ll watch a movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Master.\u201d</p><p>When had her stutter disappeared? As she rose smoothly and headed for the kitchen, he remembered he wanted to add dance back to her day\u2019s routines. He\u2019d enjoy watching her.</p><p>In the living room, he checked the end table drawer\u2014no, the little minx hadn\u2019t found the toys he\u2019d left there\u2014and flipped off the lights except for the wall sconces.</p><p>Kimberly walked in a minute later. She set the tray on the coffee table, poured a glass of wine, then knelt and offered up the drink.</p> <p>\u201cThank you, chiquita. That\u2019s beautifully done.\u201d He smoothed her hair, the ends damp from the pool, although she\u2019d had it pinned on top of her head. Her skin was still glowing from her exercise. Her breasts were filling out, and her abs and thighs showed muscle definition. Pretty sumisa, now comfortable with her nakedness in his presence. \u201cYou may pour yourself a glass as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Master. Thank you.\u201d She started to say something and hesitated.</p><p>\u201cGo on. This is our room to relax together, so you may speak freely. Although respectfully would be in your best interests.\u201d He touched her nose, and she wrinkled it at him. \u201cWhat were you going to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t had wine since\u2014since before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I hope you like this one then.\u201d He took a sip and approved. \u201cOne of the Shadowlands\u2019 submissives became engaged last month, and her mother brought out a crate of California wines as a present for her son-in-law-to-be.\u201d A bribe to delay the wedding a month so she could help plan it. Nolan had been kind enough to share a couple of bottles.</p><p>Kimberly tried the wine, and a pleased smile lit her face. \u201cIt\u2019s really good.\u201d</p><p>Raoul walked over to the dark walnut entertainment center to decide on a movie. Just to get a reaction, he pulled out a World War II film. \u201cMaybe some battles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh. How about Runaway Bride?\u201d She burst into laughter at his expression. \u201cMiss Congeniality? She\u2019s an FBI agent. You should like that.\u201d</p><p>When he shook his head in disgust, her giggles bubbled over like champagne. Was this what she had been like before her trauma? What kind of people would damage someone so bright? So sparkling with energy. He should have been there to protect her.</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cPerhaps we should watch a Chuck Norris film. You can take notes and learn something of fighting?\u201d</p><p>Fighting? Such a typical man . \u201cWell, maybe we should watch chick flicks. You can learn more about women.\u201d Kim grinned. That should get him.</p><p>Master R raised his eyebrows and stepped close enough that her bare breasts rubbed on his shirt. Her nipples bunched in reaction.</p><p>\u201cDo you feel my knowledge of women is lacking, gatita?\u201d he asked softly. His dark eyes caught hers and held...held as every bone in her body turned into melted butter, and the promise in his gaze blanked her mind. When he cupped her chin and kissed her, so gently, lingering for a second before he retreated, her nerves started to fire in random bursts. \u201cKimberly? I asked you a question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm?\u201d Question: Did she think he needed to know anything more about women? If he did, God help them all. \u201cUm.\u201d She shook her head, trying to throw off the sensual haze. Her nipples throbbed. \u201cPerhaps not.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and handed her a DVD. \u201cHow about this one? Chocolat.\u201d</p><p>That was a strange choice. She blinked and nodded.</p><p>\u201cVery good.\u201d He inserted the DVD, took his place on the leather sofa, and patted the cushion beside him.</p><p>Snuggling against him, as he liked\u2014and she\u2019d started to really like\u2014she sipped her wine and watched the film.</p><p>\u201cI know women go crazy over chocolate,\u201d Master R said after a bit, \u201calmost as much as men obsess about sex.\u201d He pulled her onto his lap, leaning her back against his left arm. She stiffened, then relaxed. \u201cSince you\u2019ll enjoy a chocolate movie more than me, I should get a treat for every time they eat candy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour logic isn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cupped her face with his free hand, and his lips took hers, lightly in the way she\u2019d grown used to. Then his tongue stroked insistently. He tasted of wine and of himself. Her hands curled around his forearm as heat rose inside her.</p><p>Lifting his head, he smiled down in her eyes. When he tried to move his hand, she realized she still clung to his arm and had to force her fingers open.</p><p>Shifting slightly, making her fully aware of the erection pressing against her bare bottom, he refilled her glass. She tried to check his, but it was behind her, on the end table. After handing over her drink, he resumed watching the movie. Jerk.</p><p>Before Kim had more than a few sips, the heroine talked someone into sampling her wares, and Master R kissed her again.</p><p>How much chocolate do they eat in this movie?</p><p>A lot. Each kiss grew more drugging, wetter, deeper. No longer teasing, he took her mouth hard, ravaging until her toes curled and heat flushed her skin.</p><p>She felt the wetness growing between her legs. Her fingers tangled in his black hair; her other hand pressed against his chest and the iron muscles that flexed as he lifted her closer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When he raised his head, his eyes were half-lidded with his passion. He smiled slightly and paused the movie. \u201cI have a couple of toys to add to the evening. Stand up, please.\u201d</p><p>Toys? When a man\u2014a dom\u2014said toys, he didn\u2019t mean stuffed animals or baseballs. A shiver ran through her. His eyes narrowed in warning. She jumped to her feet.</p><p>He pulled a package out of the end table\u2019s drawer. \u201cOpen.\u201d He patted her thighs lightly to have her widen her stance, but this time he kept tapping until her legs were so far apart that she rocked unsteadily. \u201cYou may hold on to my shoulders to keep your balance.\u201d</p><p>She rested her hands on his hard, hard shoulders, her loose hair falling over her arms. Her pussy felt open. Exposed. Oh God, what was he going to do? She bit her lip, trying to remember she\u2019d asked for this. \u201cTouch me some,\u201d she\u2019d said. You\u2019re an idiot, Kim. Her fingers dug into his skin.</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d The package held a small bullet vibrator. He slickened it in her wetness\u2014and she realized she was very, very wet.</p><p>She had an instant of fear as his calloused fingers touched her so intimately, and then with a smooth move, he pushed the toy inside her vagina.</p><p>At her gasp, he looked up, studying her for a second, his hand still between her legs. His dark brown eyes held lust but also concern...for her. As he watched her, his finger traced through her folds, spreading the wetness, establishing that...that he could. Marking his ownership.</p><p>Her body tingled, top to bottom, with his slow stroking.</p><p>\u201cGood sumisa,\u201d he murmured. He patted her thigh, indicating she could stand up straight. Her thighs closed over her swollen, throbbing labia.</p><p>\u201cNow put these on.\u201d From the drawer, he brought out a black lace thong.</p><p>What an odd choice. As she pulled the thong on, she noticed something firm in the crotch. What the? She opened her mouth, and he shook his head no.</p><p>He set his glass of wine and two small boxes on the coffee table and pulled it closer. Resting his back against the sofa arm, he stretched out with his legs on the cushions. \u201cNow sit here\u2014silently\u2014and we\u2019ll watch the rest of the movie.\u201d</p><p>She could feel the bullet inside her. The thing in the thong rubbed on her pussy as he took her hand and pulled her onto his lap. He leaned her shoulders against his chest, her legs between his. His thick erection pressed against her bottom, and her breath stopped. Then started. This was Master R.</p><p>He put her glass of wine in her hand and resumed the movie.</p><p>Five minutes. As she relaxed, she found she liked leaning against him. A rather lumpy chair rest, but warm. He had his right arm around her waist, and the coffee table was close enough he could pick up his glass of wine with his other hand. She told herself she wasn\u2019t nervous\u2014I\u2019m handling this quite well, really\u2014despite the quivers in her stomach and the way her mind kept replaying how he\u2019d touched her pussy. After trying to sip, she realized her glass was empty. She frowned at it.</p><p>Even his chuckle seemed to have a Spanish accent. \u201cYou have no reason to be nervous...yet, sumisita,\u201d he whispered in her ear and filled her glass. As she took it, he kissed her ear, sending goose bumps racing down her arms. And she was feeling the effect of the wine\u2014not drunk, but...comfortable.</p><p>As he leaned back again, somehow he\u2019d moved so the dark hair on his forearm tickled the undersides of her breasts.</p><p>On the big-screen TV, a man saw his wife on her knees, scrubbing a bathroom. He looked at her butt in the air and walked forward, his intent very clear.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you should clean the bathroom on your knees,\u201d Master R murmured. The thought of him coming up behind her, bending over her... She took a slow breath.</p><p>He ran his finger over her naked stomach, making the muscles quiver, then reached sideways and picked up one of the little boxes.</p><p>The vibrator inside her came to life with a low buzz. She jumped at the weird sensation. Her wine sloshed in the glass, and his arm tightened around her ribs.</p><p>\u201cIt is not hurting you, gatita,\u201d he said soothingly. \u201cRelax and watch the movie. I will quiz you on the plot later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>That earned her a nip on her ear. \u201cSilence.\u201d</p><p>The vibrator buzzed inside her, making her...aware...but not rousing her nearly as much as the feeling of Master R\u2019s arm so close to her breasts, his cheek resting on her hair, the sensation of his chest moving under her with each breath.</p><p>The buzz stopped, and she relaxed. Johnny Depp appeared, and the movie revved up much like her arousal. What did Master R have planned? She\u2019d probably be okay with it, but damn, she wished she knew.</p><p>He set his wine down on the coffee table, and a second later, the lump in her thong hummed. It was a vibrator too, and oh God, it was almost against her clit. Her muscles tensed.</p><p>She froze completely when he reached around her, traced his fingers up her pussy, and resettled the vibrator directly on her clit.</p><p>Oh God, she couldn\u2019t ignore that, not when he cupped her mound, pressing the vibrator into her. \u201cNooo.\u201d It hummed on her, tightening her muscles, sending panicky feelings running through her.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He removed his hand from her pussy and took her wineglass before she spilled it. \u201cGive me a number.\u201d</p><p>Number for what? Fear. She started to speak, then remembered to show it, like he\u2019d ordered. Six fingers\u2014no, not really. A slow breath. Three fingers.</p><p>\u201cVery good. Are you watching the movie?\u201d</p><p>The thong vibrator stopped, leaving her clit tight, hard, as if the vibrations still continued. \u201cY-yes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>His laugh rumbled in her ear. \u201cAren\u2019t you a good girl.\u201d</p><p>They were going to make love tonight. She knew it. Or maybe not. He was devious. She\u2019d expected him to take her in bed the last two nights, and he\u2019d held off, teasing her in the pool one night, on the shore the next. Leaving her scared yet aching with need and wanting more of his touch.</p><p>I want this from him. I want to move on\u2014to get past being afraid.</p><p>He stroked her stomach, brushed his hand against the undersides of her breasts, trailed down under the black lace to her mound. Then lower, his fingers touching the beginning of her cleft. \u201cYou\u2019re being very obedient, keeping yourself shaved for me. I like how nice and smooth you are, Kimberly.\u201d His finger never moved lower, just teased the top. Her clit seemed to throb as if begging for a touch. His touch.</p><p>He took a sip of wine and set the glass down on the coffee table. The vibrator inside her came on, jolting her hips up. With his hand on her mound, he pressed her back down. His palm was on her pubic bone, and he fanned his fingers out, tiny touches over her pussy. The vibrations weren\u2019t enough to get her off, but he\u2019d turned the intensity higher.</p><p>\u201cAh, you feel it this time, don\u2019t you, gatita?\u201d he murmured in her ear. \u201cLook how pretty.\u201d His hand closed over her breast lightly, and she could feel the stiffness of her nipples. Bunched and aching. He ran his finger around each one.</p><p>\u201cYou are to be watching the movie, mi peque\u00f1a sumisa.\u201d</p><p>Heat simmered under her skin as she tried to obey, but everything the actors did on the screen, even the way they bit into the chocolate pieces, made her hotter.</p><p>\u201cKissing you is difficult now,\u201d he murmured, \u201cbut this will serve instead.\u201d He rolled her right nipple between his fingers, and the edgy pain on the sensitive peak blazed fire straight to her pussy.</p><p>When Johnny Depp ate another candy, Master R rolled her left nipple. Kim moaned. Hunger pulsed in her bloodstream, and it sure wasn\u2019t for chocolate.</p><p>The inside vibrator turned off.</p><p>She sagged against him, let out a sigh, but the thong vibrator started. \u201cDamn you!\u201d Oh, oh shit. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sir. Master. Please...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are certainly grumpy at being aroused, aren\u2019t you?\u201d The amusement in his voice didn\u2019t help her nerves any. Not knowing what a wicked sense of humor he had. \u201cHow should I discipline you, gatita?\u201d His fingers tightened on her nipple in a stinging pinch, then moved to the other. Pain...need shot straight to her pussy. Her hips tried to rise, but his right hand stayed firmly on her mound, just above the vibrator. He fondled each breast, making soft circles around the areolae and then squeezing her nipples. Tugging. Rolling. He had her trapped, leaving her no choice but to accept whatever he wanted to do.</p><p>The vibrator hummed against her, bringing her up, teasing her, never quite enough. Nothing was enough. She was in his arms, being touched, using vibrators, and still not getting off.</p><p>She\u2019d probably never get off again. The thought dropped her mood, and she sagged against him, her arousal seeping away.</p><p>His hands stilled. He kissed her hair. \u201cWell, since you don\u2019t like the thong, you may remove it.\u201d</p><p>Her lips quivered, and tears stung her eyes. He\u2019d given up on her too. Because he knew how hopeless it was.</p><p>He pushed her to her feet, stood beside her, and waited until she set the thong on the coffee table.</p><p>As he studied her, his gaze lingering on her breasts, she felt naked, really naked, because he was looking at her not as a servant, but as a woman. She followed his gaze and saw her distended clit poked out from between her labia, glistening with her arousal. A flush crept up her face, and she shifted her weight, wanting to hide. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The sun lines at the corners of his eyes deepened. \u201cSince I intend for you to come tonight\u2014and I do\u2014and the thong doesn\u2019t agree with you, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll have to suffer from my personal attentions.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t given up at all. Oh God. Her eyes widened as he moved the wine and the remotes to one side, then lifted her and stood her in the middle of the walnut coffee table. \u201cMaster!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sumisa?\u201d He sat in front of her, almost on her toes. \u201cOpen for me.\u201d He mercilessly pushed her legs apart until her feet were at the edges of the square table. He moved closer, his face right...oh God, right at her groin level. After pulling one of the remotes closer, he turned the bullet vibrator on. The buzz hit inside her, and she moaned.</p><p>\u201cMaster R, I don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d She bit her lip, feeling like an idiot, feeling the thing buzzing inside her. \u201cI can\u2019t. This isn\u2019t going to work.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, actually laughed. \u201cThen I\u2019ll simply enjoy myself with my little sumisa\u2019s body.\u201d His thumbs parted her labia as his fingers curled around her hips, anchoring his hands...and her as well. The feeling of his thumbs pulling her open sent heat spiraling through her again.</p><p>\u201cIf you start to lose your balance, you may put your hands on my shoulders as you did before.\u201d He looked up at her, his lips curving, \u201cI thought of asking for a number, but I can see fear isn\u2019t what\u2019s on your mind at this moment. \u201c</p><p>Fear? Embarrassment, maybe, but this was so far from what any of the slavers had done it held no comparison. It was Master R touching her.</p><p>As he leaned forward and blew a stream of warm air onto her exposed clit, the sensation shot across the nerve endings, making her toes curl. Before she got used to that, his mouth closed loosely over her.</p><p>\u201cOh, God.\u201d Hot, oh so very hot. His lips pressed and released, creating a circle of heat and pressure around the nub\u2014so, so soft yet tightening more with each repetition until her clit was trapped. A flicker of his tongue over the top weakened her knees, and she grabbed his shoulders, bending over slightly to keep from falling.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, cari\u00f1o, hang on tight.\u201d His breath teased her pussy, and then his tongue slid up and down one side of her clit, flickering over the very top, before moving to the other side. Blood swelled her tissues until they felt too tight. Bursting tight.</p><p>A whine escaped her, and his only response was to let go one hand and turn up the vibrator.</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d It shook her from deep inside. He put his hand back, fingers curving around her hip, thumb opening her labia even more firmly. As if trying to match the vibrator, his tongue rubbed at the edge of her clit, moving the looser hood back and forth, no longer teasing but demanding a response.</p><p>The pressure grew inside her, her climax approaching as inexorably as a rising tide. Her toes tingled, and the muscles of her thighs trembled until she wondered if she\u2019d fall. She couldn\u2019t seem to care. Everything in her tuned to the movements of his tongue as it rubbed one side of the bundle of nerves, then the other. His lips closed around her, trapping her clit in heat, tightening.</p><p>Her fingernails dug into his shoulders, her hips giving little jerks, needing...more. She wanted to pull him closer, needed to, but he held her ruthlessly, doing exactly as he wanted.</p><p>Slowly his lips tightened, pinching the nub. He sucked lightly, and his tongue butterflywinged over the very top, and everything in her tightened, tightened. The roaring of surf sounded in her ears.</p><p>He sucked\u2014oh, God\u2014sucked strongly, and sensation gripped her spine like a fist until it exploded; everything spasmed in massive waves around the humming thing at her center, shaking her in an earthquake of sensation.</p><p>His thumbs released her, and his hands curved under her ass, holding her up\u2014holding her against his mouth as he flicked her gently again, making it last. Her legs gave out entirely, and his rumbling laugh against her clit made her come again. Without any effort at all, he lifted her. \u201cPut your legs around me,\u201d he said in a firm voice. She was shaking too hard to fight him.</p><p>She\u2019d had orgasms. She\u2019d been afraid that part of her life was over. But he\u2019d done what she asked and gone further even. Aroused her\u2014pleasured her.</p><p>His eyes had darkened to almost black; satisfaction filled his smile. \u201cYou taste very nice, cari\u00f1o. Since we\u2019ve crossed over this bridge, and several days remain where you are still under my command, I will enjoy having my mouth on you often.\u201d</p><p>A shudder of anticipation ran through her, and his firm lips curved up.</p><p>As he set her on the sofa, pushing her back, she realized the vibrator inside her was off. He pushed her legs apart. She was so wet, his fingers slid inside easily, despite the way she clenched around him. He removed the bullet and laid it on the end table. Then he sat beside her, pulled her against his side, and kissed the top of her head. \u201cYou did very well, sumisita m\u00eda. I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d</p><p>The joy of pleasing him mingled with her own satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to continue?\u201d He moved to see her face, his eyes intent, waiting for her answer...and expecting an honest one.</p> <p>Continue. That meant he would... Her mouth went dry. \u201cNo. Yes. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you trust me, Kimberly?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>She\u2019d never trusted a man the way she trusted him. When had that happened? \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d She tilted her head up, reached to touch his stern jaw, feeling the slight scrape of his five o\u2019clock shadow. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see how far we can go.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. No. Her breathing sped up, and then he asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s your safe word?\u201d</p><p>Safe word. He\u2019d stop if she panicked. She swallowed and said firmly, \u201cCramp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good.\u201d He stood and started to unbuckle his belt.</p><p>Fear turned her cold as memories drowned her: men surrounding her, undoing their pants, pulling out... Her feet drew up, and she scrambled into a corner of the couch.</p><p>His hands stilled, and he watched her. So silent. After a long minute, he held his arms away from his sides. \u201cI would like your pretty hands to unclothe me, gatita.\u201d</p><p>Me?</p><p>Not moving, he waited, his gaze never leaving her face. Patient. After a minute, he prompted, \u201cIt will be my pleasure, Master. Is this not what you say?\u201d</p><p>He can hardly do anything with clothes on, she told herself, the sweet sense of satiation gone completely. I wanted to do this. I can. She swallowed and whispered, \u201cIt will be my pleasure, Master.\u201d So, so not true.</p><p>It felt as if it took her an hour to stand up, naked in front of him. Another hour before she touched him. She\u2019d seen him before, she told herself. They showered together, after all.</p><p>His lips curved when her hand reached his belt. \u201cYou smell like flowers, cari\u00f1o. I like the shampoo you brought with you. What do I smell like?\u201d</p><p>She blinked, diverted from the icy terror surging up and down her spine. The end of his belt slipped loose. She unzipped his pants. \u201cUm. Clean. Not flowery, more like a\u2014the ocean. Not sweet.\u201d</p><p>His hand cupped her cheek; his thumb touched her lips lightly, a gentle kiss of skin. \u201cAnd I am not sweet, mi peque\u00f1a sumisa.\u201d His eyes caught hers, dark and intent. Determined.</p><p>A shiver of fear\u2014of heat\u2014went through her at the thought of him inside her. His cock sprang free, and she realized he\u2019d gone commando. This was it. She felt like a statue, frozen in stone.</p><p>\u201cYou have a choice, sumisa,\u201d he said gently. \u201cWe have both been tested, and your birth control is still active. Do you wish a condom or not?\u201d</p><p>No longer a question of if they\u2019d have sex, but just what way. It felt as if she was being pulled into a whirlpool. \u201cUm.\u201d Memories spinned into the circle with her...the plastic, slick horrible feel of the...others. They\u2019d worn condoms. Their...they hadn\u2019t felt real, just evil. \u201cNo. No condom.\u201d</p><p>He looked surprised but simply took hold of her and moved her so he could sit in the center of the couch. \u201cKneel on the sofa. Straddle me, Kimberly,\u201d he said, his voice so very gentle.</p><p>Her hands had gone numb; her lips tingled like she\u2019d been sucking on ice. She put a knee on each side of his thighs, trying to not see the thick erection raised between them, the piercing glinting in the light. He gripped her behind her thighs and pulled her forward until her pelvis pressed against his erection. \u201cLook at me, little one,\u201d he said softly. \u201cWho am I? My title, my name.\u201d</p><p>Her mind blanked, until his intent gaze captured hers again. \u201cMaster R.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBueno. Whose cock are you rubbing against?\u201d A smile curved his lips. \u201cWhose cock have you washed in the shower every morning?\u201d</p><p>She had. She\u2019d touched him, washed him. The words came easier under his dark brown gaze. \u201cMaster R\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Kimberly, are you afraid of Master R?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes.\u201d</p><p>His laugh rang out, the darkly male one she loved that meant she\u2019d surprised him\u2014 delighted him. His grin flashed at her. \u201cThere\u2019s an answer to warm a dom\u2019s heart.\u201d With his eyes still dancing with laughter, he nodded at her. \u201cTime\u2019s up. Lower yourself on me, chiquita. You may go as slow as you want...as long as you don\u2019t stop.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His hands were still curled around her thighs, not moving except for his thumbs stroking her skin gently. She was shaking uncontrollably, but his laughter had freed her mind. He\u2019d put her on top. Pulled her into position, because he\u2019d known she wouldn\u2019t be able to force herself. But now, he\u2019d let her set her own pace. Her fears of being held down, tearing, ripping\u2014she shuddered.</p><p>\u201cEyes on me, Kimberly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir,\u201d she whispered. She reached down, between their bodies, and gripped his shaft, touched the piercing, and frowned. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you be little or without this...thing?\u201d</p><p>His laugh burst out again, heartening her enough that she raised up and set him at her entrance. She was very slick, still sensitive from his mouth and lips, and a quiver ran through her...not of fear.</p><p>\u201cAs slow as you want\u2014\u201d</p><p>As long as I don\u2019t stop. She let herself down, feeling the stretch. His piercing caught for a second. Then he was in. The metal pressed on her as it passed in, the sensation strange, and the rest of him followed, hot, velvet covered, sliding into her, increment by increment. The stretch, the feeling was\u2014she froze, skin going cold.</p><p>He cleared his throat, breaking into her thoughts, and she nodded. Master R. She lowered farther. \u201cYou\u2019re so damn big,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhy, thank you, cari\u00f1o,\u201d he said. He moved his hands then, massaging her bottom in a way that sent a quiver through her as it added to the sensations. She took more of him in.</p><p>Her mouth was even with his, and his hand curved over her nape, pulling her closer for a kiss. A real kiss, and he pushed his tongue inside as aggressive with his mouth as he wasn\u2019t with his cock.</p><p>Her head swirled, trying to take in everything: his hands on her bottom, his shaft in her, his mouth on hers. She lost focus and dropped down faster. Her cry of surprise let him deeper into her mouth, and he possessed it totally, then lifted his hips, filling her completely with his cock.</p><p>No! Tearing her mouth from his, she pulled up instinctively until she was almost off his shaft.</p><p>He gave her a half-lidded, lazy look. \u201cThat\u2019s very nice. You may continue doing that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou...\u201d Evil monster. She held there, trembling. But it was impossible to hold her anger\u2014or even her fear\u2014when seeing the satisfaction in his face, the humor in his eyes. She gripped his shoulders and lowered herself down again. God, he was so big.</p><p>And she was very slick. Up and down, emptiness to overwhelmingly full, and about the third or fourth time, he felt...good. She went a little faster.</p><p>He hummed his approval and moved his hands between them to fondle her breasts and tease her nipples. A slow pinch sent a shock of heat to her pussy, and she clenched around him.</p><p>\u201cVery nice. Do that\u2014squeeze me\u2014as you\u2019re lifting,\u201d he instructed. His resonant voice had slowed into a winding warm river of sound, smoothing the last jagged crests of fear.</p><p>She tightened herself around him and rose. Lowered slowly. God, she could feel the metal. The piercing slid over an area that made her shiver. Like it was rubbing at her clit from inside her.</p><p>\u201cAgain.\u201d</p><p>No pain, and the unexpected sensation of pleasure kept increasing.</p><p>\u201cSlow up, faster coming down,\u201d he murmured. He leaned his head against the couch back, his gaze wandering over her eyes, her mouth, her body, the intent look at odds with his obvious enjoyment. He didn\u2019t want to lose control enough to stop caring for her well-being.</p><p>But he liked what she was doing. The realization thrilled through her. She had something to offer\u2014something to give. And she wanted to. She lifted, then dropped onto him hard, the sudden penetration making her vagina spasm around him.</p><p>His pupils dilated, turning his eyes almost black. \u201cExactly that, cari\u00f1o. Ride me.\u201d</p><p>Her voice came out husky. \u201cYes, Master.\u201d She gripped his shoulders and obeyed, working for his climax, wanting his pleasure, and with each slide down onto his shaft, arousal began unfurling again in her own body. That piercing was too...too... Her inner thighs quivered as heat punched low in her belly and sweat moistened her skin.</p> <p>The little sub was incredibly tight, hot, and wet. Her small hands on his shoulders felt...just right. He saw how his orders took precedence over her fears and found the knowledge even more erotic than the way her pussy worked his cock with soft sucking sounds. She watched him with a woman\u2019s desire to share a connection during lovemaking, and her eyes held as much vulnerability and need to please as any submissive he\u2019d met. She didn\u2019t serve from fear, but because the giving fulfilled her.</p><p>She\u2019d grown wetter, and his groin hair was matted with her juices. Her face was flushed, and\u2014so telling\u2014an occasional shiver ran through her when her clit bumped against his pelvis.</p><p>He smiled slightly, pleased. \u201cI didn\u2019t plan to push you, but if you want to join me...\u201d Then you\u2019re going to come again, gatita.</p><p>She looked at him blankly, and he sighed. She was so out of touch with her own body.</p><p>Needing space in which to work, he slid down on the couch until he was half-lying, and she stayed upright. He released her ass and moved his fingers to her front, touching the wetness around the base of his shaft, then her swollen pussy. Her spine went rigid, as if he\u2019d used electrostim on her rather than just his hand. With his fingers covered in her juices, he edged up toward her clit. The thickness of his erection had forced the nub completely out of hiding. He swirled one finger around it.</p><p>Her breathing stopped, then went totally erratic, and she dug tiny fingernails into his shoulders. Her trust in him\u2014to let him rouse her at all\u2014shook him to the bone...but he didn\u2019t stop the slow slide of his finger over her clit. Someday she might like erotic surprises, but today, she\u2019d had enough. He stayed with a steady rhythm, rubbing the right side of her clit as she rose off his dick, the left when she lowered.</p><p>That worked well until she got too excited. Wiggling replaced the rise and fall as her rhythm totally disintegrated.</p><p>He grinned. But her squirming was making his balls feel as if they were going to explode, so he\u2019d better stop stalling. With a palm under her ass, he raised her up, almost off him, then yanked her down as he thrust his hips up.</p><p>She moaned. Her breasts wobbled with the impact. And his cock hardened to the danger point.</p><p>The next time, he held her high, barely on his shaft, and used his fingers on her clit to push her toward her climax. She was panting with little moans. When she started to convulsively grip his shoulders, he dropped her down onto his shaft and had to grit his teeth as his own climax surged near breaking. She was right on the edge when he pushed her up and teased her clit with rhythmic strokes.</p><p>Then, tilting to get the most pressure on her G-spot from his piercing, he slammed her down.</p><p>Her back arched. Her head tipped. Her breathing stopped.</p><p>He murmured to her, \u201cIt\u2019s time to come, sumisita,\u201d and as if given permission, her cunt contracted around him like a hot fist; the walls battered at his cock as she climaxed violently. She didn\u2019t scream, not this little abused slave, but a tiny mewl escaped her as she rubbed harder against his fingers, took him deeper, obviously not wanting it to end.</p><p>He gave her more, until she loosened her hands on his shoulders, until she was gasping for breath. Por Dios, she was beautiful.</p><p>\u201cMy turn now, gatita.\u201d Her eyes were still glazed when he took her hips between his hands to lift her, then yank her down. Up, down. Her vagina contracted around him with each thrust, giving her aftershocks of pleasure that he saw reflected in her flushed face.</p><p>Up, down. His balls contracted against his groin; his erection swelled, ready to burst. He rode the edge, unwilling to release as the pressure at the base of his spine grew and then blasted out of his control, ripping through his cock in hard spasms. The feeling of his hot seed filling her soft cunt shook him.</p><p>When his mind cleared, he managed to move, lifting and turning on the couch so he could flatten out. He puffed a pillow under his head, brought his leg up onto the cushions. Still sitting on his dick, she sagged, her eyes closed, only her arms holding her upright as if she\u2019d frozen into that position.</p><p>Or feared to lie on him?</p><p>\u201cCome here, cari\u00f1o,\u201d he murmured, pulling her hands from his shoulders and letting her drop down on his chest. She started to push up again.</p><p>\u201cShhh.\u201d He placed one hand on her ass, keeping them pinned together so his softening cock remained in her cunt as he coaxed her to put her legs between his. Finally she lay flat on top of him. Yes, he could have withdrawn and arranged them more easily, but he wanted to stay inside her, reminding her of their connection\u2014one of pleasure, not pain.</p><p>He curved his hand at the back of her head, nudging it onto his shoulder. When he put his arms around her and held her firmly, her last bit of resistance fled, and she lay quietly. Hot and sweaty and slick, this soft woman whose curves fit him in all the right places. He couldn\u2019t have designed such a fine melding.</p><p>He lifted his head. Her eyes were closed, worries gone. \u201cI like being in you, Kimberly,\u201d he said softly. \u201cYou\u2019re warm and soft, inside and out.\u201d</p><p>She stirred, and he saw the tiniest curve of her lips.</p><p>He stroked her hair, seeing the way the light glinted off it, dispelling the perception of complete black. Some strands were brown, some with a reddish tint. \u201cYou were afraid of having me on top of you, no?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The instant tensing of her back muscles saddened him.</p><p>\u201cShhh.\u201d He kept the slow movement of his hand, kissed the top of her head. \u201cNow tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her face pressed closer into the hollow of his shoulder as if she were a small animal needing shelter.</p><p>His arms tightened, reminding her that she had his protection. \u201cBecause of the way they took you?\u201d</p><p>A tiny nod. \u201cOn my back or like a dog. Both...places.\u201d</p><p>Anal and vaginal. \u201cIn your mouth?\u201d</p><p>Her snort of derision held tears as well. \u201cI bit him.\u201d She tensed again. \u201cAnd then he used...he...\u201d</p><p>Raoul\u2019s jaw tightened until his teeth ground together. Of course. The asshole had strapped her in a device to hold her mouth open while he face-fucked her. Cabr\u00f3n. \u201cHe is unworthy to call himself a man.\u201d Her shoulder muscles relaxed under his slow, careful massage. \u201cIf you might recall from your...excursion...into my toy cabinet, I do not own such a thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d More muscles went loose. Her breathing slowed, a small waft of warmth on his skin.</p><p>\u201cBut, although I like being inside you here\u201d\u2014he wiggled the soft remainder of his erection, and her responsive pussy clenched, pushing him all the way out. He grinned at her tiny sound of loss\u2014\u201cwe might also have fun with my cock here.\u201d He squeezed an ass cheek, making her jump. \u201cWill you trust me to take you carefully, Kimberly?\u201d</p><p>This was why he\u2019d decided to speak of such matters now\u2014to prepare her for the next step while her body resonated with an orgasm, and while his so terrifying dick was soft and melting between her legs after having brought her only pleasure.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d She sighed. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He gave her the tiny growl he knew she\u2019d recognize.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Sir.\u201d A pause. \u201cMaster.\u201d</p><p>Satisfaction was a gentle evening rain, and headier than the wine they\u2019d had earlier. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Her voice was husky. \u201cYou\u2019ll want my mouth too.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cOnly if you promise not to bite.\u201d</p><p>Her lips curved again, more this time. \u201cYes, Master.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>The next morning, Kim went down to the beach. The gulls cried overhead, and gray-brown willets foraged in the shallows. The tide was coming in, the waves slowly reclaiming the sand as she was reclaiming more of her life.</p><p>I had sex. She grinned at the sun. Its rays warmed her skin, and she bubbled with life, feeling as if she\u2019d taken a huge step forward.</p><p>Heck, she had. She shook her head, unbraiding her hair so the wind could ruffle it with salty fingers. Master R liked her hair. Liked her skin. Said she was lovely, and his face held no untruth.</p><p>She rolled her eyes. He was her master. Why would he bother lying? It wasn\u2019t as if he had to talk her into bed, right?</p> <p>He liked her. He\u2019d taken more care with making sure she was satisfied than anyone ever had. And then at the very end, he hadn\u2019t stopped\u2014he\u2019d made her serve his own satisfaction, and that had been as fulfilling as getting off herself.</p><p>She headed for the Adirondack chair. Weathered white with age, it ruled over its section of sand like a beach throne. She dropped onto it, then squeaked. A little sore maybe?</p><p>God, she\u2019d gotten off so thoroughly she still quaked inside. And she wanted to do it again. Wanted those strong hands on her, to feel his biceps bunching into concrete when he lifted her, to trace the ridges on his stomach. This morning, when he\u2019d washed her\u2014more intimately than ever before\u2014he told her she was filling out and he liked her soft ass sized for his big hands.</p><p>He scared her and excited her and made her want him.</p><p>Want him. As the sun disappeared behind a cloud and shadows slid over the sand, a chill raised goose bumps on her arms. Life wasn\u2019t all sun and pretty waves. The clouds came, storms drowned ships, and people moved on.</p><p>You realize he\u2019s just doing his job, right? Don\u2019t go all teenage-girl gaga over him. Her inner cynic\u2019s interjection was like a cold dip in the water. And was right, unfortunately.</p><p>Master R liked her, but he was in this to shut down the slavers, not to start up a relationship with a messed-up woman. He\u2019d never talked about being together after this was over.</p><p>She watched a tiny hermit crab peek out of its stolen shell and retreat again, hiding in the secure spiral. \u201cYeah, me too, little guy,\u201d she whispered. Don\u2019t get too far from safety. Falling head over heels in love with Master R would be...pretty much...the worst thing she could do.</p><p>He wanted a slave.</p><p>She hated even the word.</p><p>So. Once they pulled this off, she\u2019d go home to Savannah. To her real life.</p><p>Christopher Greville leaned back in his office chair as his majordomo entered. \u201cYou rang for me, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDutton, when I was doing the accounts, I found a large deposit into the Owner\u2019s account. It matches what I paid for a certain slave.\u201d</p><p>The majordomo\u2019s swarthy face flushed. One of the more satisfying retainers Greville employed, he handled the household accounts, which included the purchase of slaves and any equipment needed for them, like the heavy dog kennel, the whips, and gags...</p><p>Greville smiled. The new slave had arrived two days ago, a big-breasted blonde with such an ear-piercing scream that he\u2019d been forced to gag her the first day to preserve his ears. After he and his staff had played for a while, her voice had changed to a pleasingly hoarse sound.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir,\u201d Dutton said. \u201cI forgot to mention it. After much stalling, the Overseer provided a refund for the black-haired slave. The one who\u2014\u201d He broke off.</p><p>The one who\u2019d dared to attack her master. To stab him. Greville ran his fingers over his gray suit, feeling the lingering tenderness in his shoulder. The memory of pain as the knife punched through his skin still brought him up short on occasion. The little fuckhole had\u2014 \u201cRefund.\u201d \u201cWhat refund? Dahmer gave you a refund for a dead slave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she didn\u2019t die, sir. She\u2019d bled quite a bit but was still alive when we handed her over.\u201d Dutton\u2019s expression faltered into worry. \u201cYou did tell us to get rid of her, sir.\u201d</p><p>Not dead. She\u2019d stabbed him, and she wasn\u2019t rotting in a grave? \u201cI meant kill her. Fuck her to death or beat her to death.\u201d His temper surged; he forced himself to stay seated. \u201cShe\u2019s alive?\u201d</p><p>Dutton\u2019s face paled, and he took a step back. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir. I didn\u2019t realize.\u201d</p><p>Greville stared at him and then smiled coldly. \u201cOf course you didn\u2019t. I obviously wasn\u2019t clear.\u201d He nodded a dismissal and watched the majordomo quietly leave. Incompetent bastard. He\u2019d be six feet down and feeding the worms before this week was out.</p><p>The fuckhole was alive. Greville turned to the computer and brought up the Association numbers shared with premium buyers. After using the code to get the right phone number for the current date, he punched it in.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Dahmer\u2019s number. Dahmer was a typical flunky, but an efficient one. He\u2019d definitely improved the quality of slaves in the Southeast quadrant.</p><p>\u201cGreville. I just discovered I received a refund from you. When I questioned my staff, I found they hadn\u2019t disposed of the merchandise\u2014as should have been done\u2014but had returned it to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheir actions were incorrect. Return the merchandise to me for proper handling.\u201d He would cut pieces from her body\u2014a finger, an ear, a toe\u2014and see how long he could keep her alive. Maybe let her choose which part she\u2019d sacrifice each day. But he\u2019d take her tongue first. And her teeth. Make a real fuckhole.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do that. It\u2019s been resold.\u201d</p><p>Greville\u2019s jaw clenched, and his voice came out raw. \u201cBuy it back.\u201d</p><p>A pause. \u201cI can try. As it happens, I\u2019m scheduled for a follow-up with the buyer tomorrow.\u201d Dahmer sounded annoyed, as if Greville would give a damn. \u201cBut he won\u2019t hand her over for the same price. It\u2019ll cost you.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d hear her scream. See her eyes wide with agony, fighting to escape the pain, the dismemberment. See the light go out. \u201cDo it.\u201d</p><p>The day for their trip to the Shadowlands finally arrived.</p><p>Pity eating like a worm in his heart, Raoul kept his little submissive busy with cooking and cleaning. In the afternoon, he\u2019d given her final instructions on high protocol and how an owned slave should behave in public. They\u2019d practiced until he was satisfied, and she\u2019d felt comfortable.</p><p>\u201cTime to leave, Kimberly,\u201d he called. A minute later, he heard her footsteps on the stairs.</p><p>She looked adorable. The black dress laced tightly, pressing her breasts upward, her nipples barely hidden by a froth of white lace. The ruffles at the bottom came to the crease below her ass. The token white apron covered the front. Garters held up white fishnet stockings over</p><p>her lovely legs, and she wore high-heeled fetish shoes. He knew her pussy was bare, and he had the urge to toss her onto the table and take her from the rear.</p><p>Maybe he\u2019d buy the costume from Z. But, no. She wasn\u2019t his. The knowledge she\u2019d be leaving soon didn\u2019t sit well in his gut. \u201cYou look beautiful, cari\u00f1o.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>An attempted smile was her response. He watched as she took the final few steps to stand in front of him. Body rigid. Cuffed wrists at her sides, hands fisted. Visibly fighting not to flee. It wasn\u2019t him she feared. \u201cKimberly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cM-master?\u201d</p><p>He sighed, hearing the return of the stuttered word. \u201cDoes the Overseer carry weapons?\u201d</p><p>A blink of confusion. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t think he\u2019d want anything a slave might grab and use against him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill he have his guards at the Shadowlands?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said only him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, chica, if for some reason you couldn\u2019t disable him\u2014and you might do fairly well now\u2014do you, by any stretch of the imagination, think he could beat me in a fight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d Her gaze moved over him as if comparing their sizes, Raoul perhaps a couple of inches shorter, but far more muscular. A few lines eased from her face. \u201cNo. He couldn\u2019t, could he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I think not. So...we must suffer his presence and be polite, but cari\u00f1o, no matter what happens, he will leave by himself, and you will still be with me.\u201d Raoul tapped a finger on her chin. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>Her lower lip quivered. When she tried to smile, her courage broke his heart. \u201cThanks. Master.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cGood. Now let\u2019s get this done.\u201d He picked up the black leather collar from the counter. The moment of revulsion and a memory of Alicia disappeared as he looked into Kimberly\u2019s clear blue eyes. The disconcerting desire to have her kneel, to request his collar, to kiss it, was so strong his hands shook slightly.</p><p>No, this was merely part of the costume. Not real, Sandoval.</p><p>Her big eyes fixed on his face as he buckled the leather around her throat. Z had even provided a tiny gold padlock. Damn him. It snicked shut, the heady sound of submission much louder in his head than in reality.</p><p>As he stepped back, he saw her hands trembling. Apparently the collaring affected her differently. \u201cAh, gatita.\u201d He tapped her nose, the teasing gesture enough to break her paralysis. He pressed the key into her cold little hand. \u201cYour apron has a pocket. Put this inside it.\u201d He leaned forward and whispered, \u201cBut don\u2019t let Dahmer see it.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers closed, and she gave him a jerky nod, and then slowly, a real smile appeared, like the sun from behind the clouds.</p><p>Alas, the smile didn\u2019t last long, and the night drive to the Shadowlands seemed to drag as she became increasingly tense. All he could do was hold her hand and remind her of his presence.</p><p>In the parking lot, the headlights of Raoul\u2019s car illuminated Dahmer. He stood beside his own vehicle, which was probably equipped with all the jammers that had frustrated the FBI. But the Feds would lie low now until the auction.</p><p>With an effort, Raoul pulled his emotions under control. He had a role to play: master of the slave who he would call girl and nothing else, reminding them both of their places.</p><p>He got out, nodding at Kimberly to follow. As he took his toy bag from the trunk, he worked a smile onto his face before turning. \u201cDahmer. Good to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d The man wore casual dom clothing. Black khakis, black T-shirt. He glanced up at the mansion. \u201cGreat place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d And you taint it with your presence. \u201cLet\u2019s go on in.\u201d</p><p>Raoul headed for the building, glancing back once to check Kimberly. She followed a step behind him, eyes lowered, lovely in her silence and obedience. He could see the tiny tremor as she breathed. Hang in there, sumisita.</p><p>\u201cNo restraints or gags for your slave?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo need. She won\u2019t try to run.\u201d He gave Dahmer a cruel smile. \u201cNot anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes. I heard about your methods of control. I\u2019m surprised she healed so quickly.\u201d</p><p>What methods? Raoul shrugged, not wanting to know. \u201cI feed her well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a fine costume\u2014although I\u2019m surprised she\u2019s not naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly at home, not in public.\u201d Raoul walked beside Dahmer up to the front of the Shadowlands. \u201cI keep my toys to myself. But when we\u2019re alone, I prefer naked\u2014for the view, the access, and if disciplining is needed, it can be administered without any great effort.\u201d</p><p>The Overseer barked a laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re definitely experienced.\u201d He stopped and looked around at the dimly lit grounds. \u201cI like the isolation here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo neighbors to complain about screaming.\u201d Raoul turned his palm toward the ground, and Kimberly sank to her knees. \u201cVery pretty, girl.\u201d</p><p>She glanced up long enough to meet his eyes, his approval and acknowledgement lending her stability.</p><p>\u201cYou compliment her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Raoul told the man the absolute truth. \u201cThe mark of a true slave is her desire to please her master. If I don\u2019t tell her when she\u2019s done well, then how does she know to repeat it? She works hard to earn a \u2018very good.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never thought of it that way. Then again, most buyers are into pain. They don\u2019t care to train a slave for more than sex and screaming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a shame.\u201d</p><p>With her legs feeling as spongy as a jellyfish, Kim was grateful Master R had ordered her to kneel. She felt safer with his legs shielding her. She stayed rigidly in position, taking slow breaths, trying to conquer the nausea and panic from seeing the Overseer, from hearing his horrible voice.</p><p>God, she\u2019d known she\u2019d be scared. But she hadn\u2019t realized how her physical reactions\u2014 hands and legs shaking, cold sweat despite the muggy air\u2014would somehow make her internal fear worse.</p><p>She sure hadn\u2019t expected the anger that beat like a red-hot hammer against her chest. She stared at a white jagged-edged rock, the focus of a landscaped garden plot. Her fingers curled as she saw herself picking it up, slamming it down on the monster\u2019s head. She tried to imagine how it would feel, the way he\u2019d fall forward, the sound he\u2019d make...</p><p>But then Master R would be furious she\u2019d ruined everything, and\u2014she sighed. He wouldn\u2019t be furious, Kim. He\u2019d be disappointed in her, and the thought of seeing unhappiness in his eyes calmed the storm inside her. Eventually the Overseer would get his due, but first they needed to save the others. Suck it up, wuss.</p><p>I want to go home . She pushed the longing away and concentrated on breathing. The smooth concrete was warm against her legs and Master R\u2019s dark voice a calming touch on her fears. She kept her gaze down but her head angled so she\u2019d see if he motioned for her to do something.</p><p>His tiny gesture had her standing before she even thought about it, and she realized the FBI agent had been correct. Anyone watching would notice how attuned she was to Master R. The time she\u2019d lived with him, being corrected, learning to watch for the unobtrusive movements he used to direct her\u2014none of it had been wasted.</p><p>As they took the last few steps to the Shadowlands, she chanced a reprimand and glanced around quickly, remembering the other submissives\u2019 intriguing stories.</p><p>The lights from the landscaping smoldered against the thick stone walls. The black ironwork on the doors and the heavy wall sconces didn\u2019t help lighten the effect.</p><p>Neither did the huge security guard inside the door, whose brutish features would be more suited to a medieval torturer. He glanced at her, then the Overseer. \u201cGood evening, sir,\u201d he said, his voice a match for his size. \u201cAre you lost?\u201d</p><p>Master R moved into the room from behind them. \u201cNot lost, Ben. These are my guests for tonight. I cleared it with Z.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaster Raoul.\u201d The man\u2019s pleased smile turned him from terrifying to something entirely different, like a dog so ugly and sweet it was cute. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since you were here.\u201d</p><p>Master R ran a finger along Kim\u2019s collar, brushing her skin. \u201cI had someone keeping me at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Bout time.\u201d The pleased look she got from Ben made her smile, before she remembered her place. She dropped her gaze.</p><p>\u201cDahmer isn\u2019t participating, but Z wants them both to sign the papers.\u201d He glanced at the Overseer. \u201cAs a guest, you\u2019re not required to show ID, but you\u2019re not allowed to play either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery cautious,\u201d Dahmer said. He glanced through the papers Ben handed him and signed with a scribble. Kim followed suit. The releases were much like other clubs\u2019, although more thorough, especially in the list of infractions and various punishments.</p><p>She looked up to see Ben studying her. \u201cGreat costume\u2014and you may keep your shoes on too.\u201d</p><p>Master R told the Overseer, \u201cThe owner likes submissives barefoot or in blatant fuck-me stilettos.\u201d</p><p>No club she\u2019d been to had been quite so strict. Then again, she\u2019d never been in an exclusive club like this one.</p><p>They stepped through the inside door and into chaos. Kim froze at the sounds of pain and screaming and the slaps of implements on bare flesh. Perfumes had no chance against the scents of leather and sweat and sex.</p><p>A little ways into the room, a woman with her arms restrained over her head was being penetrated by two men. Kim swallowed. Oh God, obviously fucking was allowed in the club. The atmosphere thickened, affecting her air supply.</p><p>Master R wrapped his arm around her waist. \u201cRelax, gatita,\u201d he murmured in her ear. \u201cThe last dom who tried to force a submissive against her will was tossed out the door. I think someone busted his fingers with a cane before that\u2014probably Z or Nolan. Everything here is consensual.

May I have my arm back?\u201d His amusement tipped her fear onto the manageable side, and she realized her fingers were digging holes in his wrist. \u201cSorry, M-master,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He winced and sighed. After glancing at the Overseer, who was a few feet away, watching a domme attach a chain between her submissive\u2019s hair and clit clamp, Master R said, \u201cGive me a number, Kimberly.\u201d</p><p>Her anxiety went down a notch. He\u2019d remember to check her fears. He hadn\u2019t forgotten. She opened her fingers on her bare thighs, showing six, then lowering it to five after another breath.</p><p>He smiled at her. \u201cBrave sumisita.\u201d He nodded to tables of food and drinks in the left corner. \u201cMunchies are there which we might enjoy later.\u201d</p><p>She doubted she\u2019d ever be hungry again.</p><p>In the right corner was a tiny, crowded dance floor pulsing with the Sisters of Mercy gothic rock. An immense bar occupied the center of the room with a bartender equally as big. The roped-off scene areas ran down the left and right walls and across the back. The corners held fancy spiral staircases. \u201cWhat\u2019s upstairs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrivate rooms for people who don\u2019t want to play in public\u2014or who prefer somewhere quieter afterward.\u201d His chin tilted toward a domme helping a sweat-covered, lash-marked sub up the stairs. The man dwarfed the slender woman, but there was still no denying who was in charge. \u201cZ and Jessica live on the third floor.\u201d</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t that be cramped? But the clubroom was huge, so the third floor was probably ten times the size of her duplex.</p><p>\u201cI see Master Sam has already started,\u201d Master R said to Dahmer. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we get a drink and go watch? I can introduce you afterward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fine idea.\u201d The Overseer glanced at her dismissively. \u201cDo you need to gag her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have one if it becomes necessary,\u201d Master R said, patting the toy bag slung over his shoulder. \u201cWill it be necessary, girl?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, her fear unfeigned.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s keep it that way,\u201d he snapped, his voice cold enough to give her chills. To her dismay, he snapped her cuffs together in front of her. But when he clipped a leash to her collar, she felt disconcertingly better. A leash meant they were attached. He\u2019d not be able to leave her.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Master,\u201d she whispered, and the crinkles at the corners of his eyes showed he understood.</p><p>Behind the bar, the craggy-faced bartender had his arms around a tall submissive whose golden brown latex dress matched her hair. He released her and grinned as they approached. \u201cWhat can I get you, Raoul?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA glass of red for me and a bottle of water for the girl.\u201d Master R gestured to the Overseer. \u201cAnd a martini for my guest. Dahmer, this is Cullen, one of the Masters here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelcome to the Shadowlands,\u201d Cullen said and glanced at the submissive. \u201cAndrea, see to it, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Se\u00f1or.\u201d</p><p>As the bartender engaged Master R and the Overseer in conversation about the local BDSM scene, the woman filled the men\u2019s orders. Then she set a bottled water in front of Kim.</p><p>\u201cThank\u2014\u201d Kim broke off quickly.</p><p>Master R glanced over. \u201cYou need to be gagged, girl?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head frantically.</p> <p>He ignored the big submissive\u2019s frown and turned back to the men.</p><p>Kim sagged against the bar. How could I forget? If she messed up again, he\u2019d have to gag her. She stared at the bottle of water, knowing she\u2019d heave if she tried to drink.</p><p>\u201cStill got Glenlivet back there?\u201d</p><p>Kim froze at the familiar voice. Jessica. Oh God. Don\u2019t talk to me.</p><p>She didn\u2019t. The little blonde gave Kim the polite nod of a stranger and climbed onto the adjacent barstool. \u201cHey, Andrea, Master Z sent me to get drinks.\u201d She scowled. \u201cHis usual, but I only get water.\u201d</p><p>The lady bartender sniffed. \u201cYou probably only deserve water.\u201d She leaned an elbow on the bar in front of Kim and faced Jessica, which turned her back to Master R and the Overseer. \u201cHi, Kim,\u201d she said in a very low voice, looking at Jessica.</p><p>Kim\u2019s eyes widened as she realized the submissive knew her name.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we know what\u2019s going on.\u201d Andrea laughed loudly and poked Jessica in the shoulder. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you did that.\u201d Her voice dropped again. \u201cThe Masters found keeping secrets from their subs didn\u2019t work out.\u201d She and Jessica exchanged sardonic looks, and Kim remembered Gabi\u2019s hair-raising stories. \u201cAnyway, just know we\u2019ll keep an eye on you.\u201d</p><p>Jessica nodded, her voice equally quiet. \u201cOne of us will stay beside you if for some reason Raoul can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>That had been Kim\u2019s worst fear, to be left unprotected. Tears stung her eyes.</p><p>\u201cStop that,\u201d Jessica said, half an order and half in sympathy, then slapped the bartop, saying in a normal voice, \u201cHurry up, or Master Z will think I was gossiping.\u201d</p><p>Andrea smirked, setting a bottled water on the bar. \u201cAnd you aren\u2019t?\u201d She snagged a bottle of Glenlivet and poured a shot, saying quietly, \u201cMaster Nolan\u2019s sub, Beth, is here too.\u201d</p><p>Jessica opened the water. \u201cYeah. You\u2019re part of our club now. So you get supported whether you want it or not.\u201d She took a gulp of water, picked up Z\u2019s glass, and told Andrea, \u201cLater, girlfriend,\u201d before swaggering across the room.</p><p>Andrea said, under her breath, \u201cThat\u2019s one soft-hearted bantam rooster.\u201d</p><p>The laugh Kim tried to suppress came out sounding like a sneeze.</p><p>Master R gave Andrea a frown. \u201cDon\u2019t bother my girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Sir,\u201d Andrea said. \u201cWouldn\u2019t dream of it, Sir.\u201d</p><p>The big bartender reached out a long arm and fisted her hair. \u201cMore respectful, love.\u201d</p><p>Andrea winced. \u201cYes, Se\u00f1or.\u201d Her golden-brown eyes focused on Master R. \u201cPlease forgive my rudeness, Master Raoul.\u201d</p><p>Master R gave her a cold look. \u201cMaybe add a reprimand from me to your next scene, Cullen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be my pleasure, buddy,\u201d Cullen said with a grin. \u201cI figure an extra-big anal plug would be appropriate.\u201d</p><p>Andrea\u2019s eyes turned anxious.</p><p>Master R led the way across the room toward the back. Kim was glad she\u2019d left the cap on her drink, since the tugs on the leash made the water slosh in the bottle. She unobtrusively glanced around, trying not to wince at the sounds. Groans from the right where a slender domme in a red latex dress was dripping wax over a man\u2019s engorged cock. Farther away, the rhythmic whap of a cane, and then a woman\u2019s whimpers when her dom changed targets and slapped the cane lightly over her breasts.</p><p>Near the end of the room, Master R stopped where a silvery-haired man in well-worn leathers was flogging a sub on a St. Andrew\u2019s cross. \u201cThat\u2019s Sam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good. Let\u2019s watch him work.\u201d The Overseer took a chair close to the roped-off area, Master R the one next to him. Kim knelt at his feet, keeping her master between her and the Overseer.</p><p>Master R plucked the bottle from her hand, opened the top, and gave it back, all without looking at her. Or so it seemed.</p><p>She edged close enough to feel his leg against her shoulder and hip. Just the sensation of touching him eased the knot inside her that tightened every time she heard the Overseer\u2019s sleazy voice.</p><p>As the doms watched the scene in silence, Kim struggled to ignore the sound of the lash and the submissive\u2019s crying. I\u2019m not here. Open the throttle and hear the roar of the boat; feel the spray cooling my face, the wind whipping my hair.</p><p>After a bit, she tilted her head, able to watch the scene out of the corner of her eye.</p><p>The slight movement drew the Overseer\u2019s attention. When he looked at her, the sensation was like foulness brushing against her skin. \u201cShe looks very good, Raoul. Good enough I\u2019d like to buy her back from you. With the training you\u2019ve done, she\u2019d bring you a pretty profit.\u201d</p><p>He wanted her back? A tremor ran through Kim, and her mouth went dry. Auction her off... Her breathing started to increase despite her attempts to\u2014</p><p>A jerk on her hair broke the pattern. Scalp stinging, Kim pursed her lips and exhaled. Slow. Slow. She sagged against Master R\u2019s leg. Somehow he\u2019d seen her panic when he was paying her no attention.</p><p>A little pat on her head rewarded her. \u201cSorry, but I spent too much time training this one. I\u2019d hate to start over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you could get a beauty of a slave with what you\u2019d make on this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot interested,\u201d Master R said, an irritated snap in his voice. When he turned to watch the scene, the Overseer gave up and did the same.</p><p>Kim forced her fists to open so her hands would lie properly on her thighs.</p><p>The flogging lasted far too long, and the submissive\u2019s sobs turned to screams as she struggled to evade the pain. On and on. When the poor woman eventually hit subspace and no longer felt the pain, Kim could relax.</p><p>After freeing the glassy-eyed sub, the dom bundled her into a blanket and sat her on the floor. Unhurriedly, he gave her some water and fed her bites of chocolate before putting the candy in her hand. \u201cYou okay for a minute, girl?\u201d Looking like an old cowboy, he had a voice as rough as his appearance. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes. Thank you, Master Sam.\u201d The submissive kissed his hand. \u201cThat was wonderful. I feel all...open...again.\u201d</p><p>As she nibbled the chocolate, the dom wiped down the play area and packed away his tools.</p><p>Kim concentrated on him, trying to ignore the Overseer\u2019s discussion of the scene. Trying to ignore that it would soon be her turn to be watched. And Master R had never told her what he planned.</p><p>\u201cAll done?\u201d Sam asked the submissive. He helped her to her feet, ran his hand over her abused back, and grinned at her flinch. \u201cOff you go then.\u201d</p><p>She kissed his hand again and walked away, only a slight wobble in her gait.</p><p>\u201cWill she be all right?\u201d Master R asked, the concern obvious in his voice. Kim wanted to hug him. If he could, Master R would probably take care of the whole world.</p><p>Sam looked at the pale man sitting next to his Raoul. Like a vampire, the asshole Overseer apparently didn\u2019t get out in the sun much. \u201cShe\u2019ll be fine. She likes to unwind in the sub\u2019s area, listening to the women chatter.\u201d He grinned. \u201cShe\u2019s a gay switch, so she\u2019ll probably end up taking one of them upstairs.\u201d</p><p>He spotted one of the Shadowlands trainees and held up a finger. The brunette nodded and reversed course to get him a drink from the bar.</p><p>Grabbing a towel from his toy bag, Sam wiped the sweat from his face and neck and dropped into a chair across from Raoul\u2019s guest.</p><p>\u201cSam, this is Dahmer,\u201d Raoul said.</p><p>The man leaned forward to shake hands and said, \u201cYou\u2019re quite skilled. That was a pleasure to watch.\u201d</p><p>Sam shrugged. \u201cIt was okay.\u201d He\u2019d deliberately picked a real screamer. Although some tops preferred their subs to control themselves, his bottoms knew he enjoyed the sounds of pain. This time, he\u2019d drawn as much noise as he could get out of her. \u201cBut the slut went into subspace too quickly. And if she doesn\u2019t, she\u2019ll safe-word out.\u201d He snorted. \u201cThey all do.\u201d</p><p>The Overseer nodded, as if he now understood why Sam might want a slave. \u201cThere are ways around the problem, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m hearing.\u201d Sam glanced at his friend\u2019s little slave and caught a flicker of blue eyes before she looked back down. Brave woman, and pretty as hell in the French maid costume. \u201cBut I\u2019m not interested in one like Sandoval\u2019s. I don\u2019t need someone to cook or clean, and with what I like to do to them, I wouldn\u2019t trust one wandering around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, the majority of our...clients...have the same idea. Although Raoul\u2019s results with his slave are quite impressive, we have many satisfied sadists on our buyer list, and they tend to keep their toys locked up. Closet or spare rooms work if the windows and doors are remodeled.\u201d The man smiled and added, \u201cOr even dog cages.\u201d</p><p>When the girl visibly flinched at the Overseer\u2019s words, Raoul put his hand on her head, and Sam noted a disturbing look in his eyes. The dom was too tenderhearted for his own good. Be hell of a thing if he got attached to an ex-slave. Don\u2019t be an idiot, man. No kidnapped slave is going to want a master afterward.</p><p>\u201cDahmer.\u201d Hoping to pull the asshole\u2019s attention from Raoul, Sam leaned back in his chair and said, \u201cI\u2019m rather interested. What\u2019s involved?\u201d</p><p>The Overseer\u2019s smug expression would turn a man\u2019s stomach. \u201cFirst\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Raoul interrupted. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you two alone now. I reserved the office room for my scene and should get set up.\u201d He rose, picked up his toy bag, and tugged at the leash for his slave to follow.</p><p>The Overseer nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll be along shortly to watch.\u201d</p><p>The girl cringed. When she bravely squared her shoulders and followed Raoul, Sam had to stomp on the urge to backhand Dahmer onto the ground.</p><p>The Overseer watched them walk away and commented, \u201cShe was a pleasure to fuck. Never stopped fighting, and I do enjoy a battle. The cage is what finally broke her to heel, no matter what your friend thinks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a fine trainer, but not particularly into pain...unlike me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo I understand.\u201d The Overseer went silent as Sally delivered Sam\u2019s drink.</p><p>\u201cThank you, girl,\u201d Sam said, smiling as the trainee trotted away. Her short skirt bounced over her round ass with every step.</p><p>\u201cWe almost picked that one up\u201d\u2014the Overseer nodded toward Sally\u2014\u201cbut she left town that week. May still get her later, but she\u2019s not suitable for this auction. Did I mention this one is for sadists? All the slaves offered will be masochists.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds perfect.\u201d Sam kept his voice level, although the thought of the bastards getting their hands on Sally was like hearing about a puppy being kicked to death. \u201cI enjoy taking a masochist to her limits...and further.\u201d</p><p>Dahmer leaned forward and started outlining how the procedure worked.</p><p>Sam listened, his face calm, even as anger burned in his gut. When Raoul had asked for help, Sam had agreed simply because the idea of slavery offended him. Now, after meeting Dahmer, his interest had turned purely personal. He wanted to put the guy away for years. Better yet, he\u2019d take a bullwhip to the asshole and leave only a pile of shredded flesh.</p><p>Kim obediently followed Master R across the room, and the tiny tugs on her leash were a lifeline in a sea of fear. Yet the choppy waves quieted as the distance from the Overseer increased. She glanced back. People had obscured the sight of him.</p><p>If only his existence could be obscured as well. She sighed.</p><p>Somehow Master R heard her above the music, conversations, and sounds from the scenes. After setting his bag down, he tilted her face up and studied her for a minute, then unclipped her wrist cuffs. As he wrapped his arms around her, his faded leather vest was soft under her cheek, his body solid. Strong. He rested his chin on top of her head. \u201cYou did well, cari\u00f1o. I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d</p><p>Oh, the way her heart leaped at those simple words was worrisome. Very. Once this was over, she\u2019d go back to her own life\u2014yet how much would she be missing this man, this master who held her emotions in his grasp as easily as her body. I don\u2019t care. Think about it later.</p><p>Right now, she needed all her worry efforts for the scene. A real scene. In the last few days, he\u2019d played with her in his dungeon, just a little, letting her get used to his style, to the feeling of helplessness, and to the sounds and scents again. Her panic attacks had eased off, so he could restrain her\u2014usually\u2014without her screaming and losing it. But he hadn\u2019t told her about this scene. \u201cWhat are you planning, Master?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo nervous.\u201d The sound of his voice was sexy and low with her ear against his chest. He didn\u2019t seem worried at all, and his sheer self-confidence was something else she leaned on. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a fireplay scene, gatita.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened. No way. Absolutely not. She realized with a sinking feeling that she hadn\u2019t added fire to her limit list as something to avoid. And she didn\u2019t really have a hang-up about it, just the normal dislike of getting Set. On. Fire. Drown the man.</p><p>He picked up his bag and started walking again, this time with his arm around her, which was good since her balance had gone somewhere. Probably back to Savannah. I need to go there too. Anywhere but here.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what Dahmer wanted.\u201d He touched the end of her nose with his forefinger. \u201cThe good news is I won\u2019t restrain you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo restraints? Really?\u201d A horrible fear tumbled off her chest. The thought of being helpless anywhere around the Overseer had...had been awful.</p><p>\u201cYes. Since this is the only scene we\u2019ll do in public\u201d\u2014he smiled at her\u2014\u201cyou might as well have one you will enjoy.\u201d</p><p>Enjoy? \u201cUm. Master. No restraints\u2014that\u2019s good, but I\u2019m not so sure about having you set me on fire.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. Hearing the rich sound was like being in an outside elevator, rising out of the building into the light. \u201cI don\u2019t intend to scorch you, Kimberly.\u201d He continued walking toward the far end, exchanging greetings with the club members. Was there anyone who didn\u2019t know and like him?</p><p>Near the end of the room, Kim saw Master Z. His dark gaze met hers, and he smiled slightly, lifting his chin as if giving her courage.</p><p>He had. She took a breath and followed Master R down a hallway. Large glass windows on each side let people observe scenes in the various rooms. He pulled a reserved sign off a door on the left and walked in.</p><p>The room pretended to be an office with a six-feet-high filing cabinet on the near wall, a large oak desk in the center, and a couch and coffee table on the far side.</p><p>\u201cRemove everything, including your cuffs, and kneel beside the desk, please,\u201d Master R said. He waited, eyes on her, overcoming her hesitation with his certainty she\u2019d obey.</p><p>Her hands had gone numb, her mouth dry, but she did as he ordered, folding her apron and dress, removing her stockings, and setting them on the coffee table. She knelt on the glossy hardwood floor in his preferred position, hands behind her back, knees parted. She lowered her head reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cYou may watch, gatita,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>He pulled a sturdy square table from the corner to beside the desk. Supplies came from the filing cabinet drawers. A wooden skewer with a ball of gauze wrapped around one end came from his bag. Three more followed. He poured a clear liquid into a high-sided metal bowl. A fat candle went into another heavy metal dish. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When he lit it, a shudder went through her. She gritted her teeth and looked down.</p><p>\u201cDid you use lotion after showering as I asked?\u201d His voice was casual, like checking if she\u2019d added pepper to the seasonings.</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent. It\u2019ll keep your skin nice and moist.\u201d He soaked a bath blanket in the sink and wrung it out. That, a pitcher of water, and a fire extinguisher went on the floor at the far end of the desk.</p><p>\u201cYou going to set the place on fire too?\u201d As well as me? Her voice came out a high whine.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a corollary to Murphy\u2019s law. If you\u2019re not prepared, bad things will happen. If you are, nothing goes wrong.\u201d He pulled a fabric-covered pad out of the cabinet. It was so thick it raised the top of the desk to his waist. He smiled at her. \u201cAnd this material won\u2019t burn, gatita. Now come here.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d rather not. \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d She rose, striving for poise, since three people had already gathered outside the window. She\u2019d never felt less like putting on a show.</p><p>He followed her gaze, then grasped her waist and set her on the desk. The material was cold against her butt, the foam soft. \u201cPeople will watch, and it\u2019s nice to know they enjoy what we do, but this scene, Kimberly, is only between you and me.\u201d He kissed her lightly, and she inhaled the faint scent of his cologne, the one she thought of as sea mist and testosterone.</p><p>After walking behind her, he pulled her hair to the center of her back and...</p><p>\u201cYou know how to braid hair?\u201d she asked, recognizing the tugging feeling.</p><p>\u201cMmmhmm. I used to brush and braid my mam\u00e1\u2019s hair.\u201d He was actually humming along with the music, and she realized it wasn\u2019t the Goth band playing on the dance floor. The room had its own sound system, and this was a Secret Garden album. One of her favorites. Soothing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trying to calm me down before setting me on fire.\u201d</p><p>A sharper tug on her hair. \u201cThis will not hurt you...unless I wish.\u201d He pinched her arm, a sharp nip. \u201cThat\u2019s as bad as it should get.\u201d</p><p>She breathed out. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have been doing this for many years, sumisita.\u201d He tied a string around the end of her hair and stepped in front of her, taking her face between his hard palms. His eyes were so serious and caring and yet...stern. She might be afraid, but this was what they were going to do. He wouldn\u2019t back down\u2014and why did that seem as reassuring as it did terrifying? Sometimes she didn\u2019t make any sense, even to herself.</p><p>\u201cThis is about trust, cari\u00f1o, as so many scenes are. Human instinct is to fear the flame. Now we shall see if your trust in me can overcome it.\u201d</p><p>Oh, when he talked like that, she knew he\u2019d never hurt her. \u201cI trust you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cBrave gatita,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI know you do. Now I want you on your knees, ass high, leaning on your forearms.\u201d</p><p>What? He planned to set her butt on fire first?</p><p>Once she was positioned, he ran his hands over her, rubbing firmly, waking her skin, waking her, darn him, as he moved from her shoulders, to her waist, and slowly down. He fondled her bottom for a long while, never touching anything, until all her anythings throbbed, needing to be touched. Her fingers tightened on the foam as she realized he was deliberately arousing her.</p><p>As he pushed her legs slightly apart, she felt her wetness dampening her inner thighs. A second later, he pressed open her folds with his fingers, and he gave a satisfied hum.</p><p>Dammit, after the past few days, he knew just how to turn her on, and her body roused for him at a finger snap anyway. Too easily. Her head bowed, and she shut her eyes tightly. Slut. I\u2019m a dirty\u2014</p><p>The sound of a hand hitting flesh was simultaneous with the shocking sting on her bottom. \u201cOw!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think those nasty thoughts about my sumisita, Kimberly.\u201d Another ruthless swat made her grimace as the pain shot through her.</p><p>His thick finger touched her pussy and pushed firmly into her. She gasped. Her need to wiggle was stopped by the heavy palm on her ass. He slid his finger in and out and chuckled. \u201cI think if you stay with me much longer, we should have a few spanking sessions just for fun.\u201d</p><p>Her no was contradicted by the way her pussy contracted around him.</p><p>\u201cSpread your legs more,\u201d he said, and as she opened, his other hand traced a path between her labia, spreading wetness upward. When one calloused finger grazed over her clit, slick and rough at the same time, she moaned at the excruciating jolt of pleasure.</p><p>\u201cFeel, gatita. This is \u2018A.\u2019\u201d His finger slid up and around her clit in an odd pattern. \u201cB.\u201d A different pattern. \u201cC.\u201d Swirling touches over her clit. Never the same place twice. But with each new letter and the slow thrust of his finger, in and out, her need steadily increased.</p><p>\u201cG...\u201d</p><p>No. Stop. She could feel the blood swelling her tissue until her lower half pulsed in time with her heart.</p><p>Two fingers slid into her, filling and stretching. \u201cL.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to come. Please, Master. No. Not here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis time you don\u2019t have a choice, cari\u00f1o,\u201d he said levelly. He never slowed, actually pressed deeper. \u201cO... But since you don\u2019t want to share with our audience, then you will come without moving or making any noise...or I\u2019ll spank you some more.\u201d</p><p>Oh God, that just made her more frantic\u2014and he knew it. Drown him. Her fingers gripped the edges of the foam pad as her willpower started to disintegrate, leaving her unmoored, floating away on the tide.</p><p>\u201cR.\u201d After kissing the hollow of her back, he nipped her bottom, and the zing of pain sent a tremor through her.</p><p>Don\u2019t move; don\u2019t make noise. She trembled, trying to hold still, needing to wiggle, feeling how her vagina tightened around his fingers as she got closer. No, I don\u2019t want to. Her world narrowed to his slow tracing of the alphabet until each nerve around her clit quivered in anticipation of his touch. Oh God, she needed more. More. Her pulse hammered in her ears and between her legs. As her muscles tightened, her ass tilted just a little more.</p><p>\u201cV.\u201d He chuckled, a low sound that almost sent her over. And then, to her shock, he added another finger, thrusting hard. She gasped as every muscle contracted around him, increasing the sense of fullness.</p><p>Her body gathered; her breathing slowed to nothing. Almost. Oh please.</p><p>\u201cWe should try clamping this someday.\u201d His words made no sense...until his fingers firmly pinched her clit.</p><p>Oh oh oh. Explosion. Mind-shattering pleasure blasted outward as every nerve in her body fired at once. She shuddered\u2014don\u2019t move\u2014and her immobility intensified everything until her skin itself pulsed with the sensations. She shoved her hand into her mouth, trying to stifle the cries.</p><p>\u201cPretty sumisita.\u201d As he chuckled and released her clit, the blood surged madly back into it, and the rush of sensation seized her body, shaking it out of her control.</p><p>He slid his fingers out and gripped her hips, holding her firmly. Her heart thudded against her ribs as she gasped for air.</p><p>\u201cI heard too much noise, and you definitely moved,\u201d he said. Before she had a chance to regain her breath, four more stinging swats landed on her bottom.</p><p>Her insides clenched as the sting somehow engulfed her clit in another rolling wave of pleasure. She tried not to moan. Who knew what he\u2019d do?</p><p>His sure hands rubbed her stinging cheeks, soothing the burn. Soothing her. Her breathing started to slow.</p><p>\u201cDown you go,\u201d he said, pulling her legs out straight and flattening her, stomach-down, on the pad.</p><p>Oh God. Her butt throbbed, and her body still jerked from coming so fast and hard. Now more? I don\u2019t want to do this.</p><p>He dangled her braid off the side of the desk, laid a damp hand towel over her hair, and pulled the sturdy table of torture toys closer. When he lit the candle, it flamed up like a torch, scaring her spitless. With a grunt, he took something from his boot and snipped the wick. Making the flame shorter. Flame.</p><p>She closed her mouth over a whimper.</p><p>He returned the tool to his boot, then leaned over the table, his hand on her back. With a squeeze on her shoulder, he kissed her cheek. She saw the stern set of his jaw. His dark, dark brown eyes looked into hers. \u201cDo you trust me, cari\u00f1o?\u201d</p><p>The question melted whatever resistance remained after his demonstration of how easily he could control her body. \u201cI do,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He waited.</p><p>\u201cI do, Master.\u201d He\u2019d showed he owned her body; now he wanted her soul as well\u2014and he had it. God help her, he did.</p><p>His knuckles grazed down her face, over her lips. \u201cYou please me very much, gatita,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>Oh, she wanted to, so very badly.</p><p>He moved away to lower the lighting in the room until it was like dusk after a sunset. Then he leaned on the desk, close enough she could feel his body brush against hers. \u201cBreathe, Kimberly, and listen to the music. I picked this for you.\u201d</p><p>As his calloused hand stroked up and down her back, her muscles relaxed, flattening into the pad. Her breathing kept pace with the rhythm of the song, the slow sweep of his hand.</p><p>She felt something different\u2014a cool streak and a flashing warmth almost simultaneously, and his hand slid over the same spot. Again, and again, and she realized there was no pain, just a touch of cool, then heat following and disappearing under the rough stroke of his hand. A circle around her bottom. Down her legs and up to her back. His rhythm was the lapping of water on the beach, not quite regular, but so natural. Warmth, stroke. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her eyes were open, and she watched the shadows dance on the wall with the flash of flame, then die down to darkness again. She could hear, dimly, the sound of people outside the room, their voices like seagulls in the distance.</p><p>The heat intensified, nipping at her skin, yet her worry slid away as her body and her mind grew too heavy to stay focused.</p><p>His low baritone broke into her calm. \u201cYou\u2019re being such a good girl, mi peque\u00f1a sumisa. Time to turn over.\u201d</p><p>How did he make his voice tug at her like a strong current? His firm hands rolled her over, and cool air washed over her front. He arranged her arms at her sides and pulled her hair over the end of the desk again.</p> <p>\u201cDo you want to watch the flame, gatita?\u201d he asked in that soft, smooth voice. \u201cI love your accent,\u201d she said, unsure if she was dreaming.</p><p>How strange a thing to say, but his eyes crinkled, and he simply repeated, \u201cDo you want to watch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Her back didn\u2019t hurt, not at all, except for her bottom where... \u201cYou spanked me,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d He lifted her shoulders high enough to push a wedge pillow under the pad. \u201cAnd I enjoyed it very much. You have a very spankable ass, no?\u201d</p><p>Her giggle sounded odd. She felt like a bubble rising up out of the ocean, heading for the surface.</p> <p>He turned, a little skewer with the white gauze burning like a minitorch. He ran it down her thigh, the streak of flame almost gone before the stroke of his hand erased it completely.</p><p>\u201cOooh, that\u2019s so pretty.\u201d</p><p>The flash of his smile was just as pretty. Then the rhythm came back, the blip of coolness, the flash of the flame, his big hand wiping it out so the touch of fire stayed only warm...or sometimes with little teeth.</p><p>He changed out the skewer thing for another, giving her a slow kiss between, making her happy that her mouth was available. He worked his way across her stomach, upward toward her breasts.</p><p>She knew she should worry, only her fear never quite surfaced before her breast lit with the dancing flame and, like magic, was gone. Her skin tingled, her nipple contracting as if unsure if it was supposed to get aroused. He held the torch away and stopped to lick that peak.</p><p>Then he closed his lips over her other nipple in a reversal of the order\u2014hot mouth, cool air. The flame.</p> <p>Around the outer sides of her breasts. Down the center. Flames danced across her body...</p><p>He smiled at her, his eyes holding the heat of the fire, and she realized the flickering was gone from the room and only his hands were left, his hands on her breasts, his mouth over her clit, and her arousal coming up and breaking over her like storm waves over a rocky shore.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>He\u2019d never had a submissive climax so sweetly or trust him so completely. Raoul hadn\u2019t shaken off the exquisite ache of tenderness...until he turned and saw the window.</p><p>He\u2019d been so far into topspace during the scene that he hadn\u2019t noticed when the Overseer had arrived, but the cabr\u00f3n stood there now. Raoul nodded at him.</p><p>Dahmer tilted his head toward the clubroom, then strolled away. Displeased he\u2019d had to share anything with the bastard, Raoul frowned. Time to finish talking and get Dahmer out of the Shadowlands, which meant subjecting Kimberly to his presence again.</p><p>Of course, without Dahmer, he and Kimberly wouldn\u2019t be here at all. Or together. She was worth it.</p><p>He smiled to see she hadn\u2019t roused, was still tranced out. He ran his fingers over her skin, feeling only a dry heat like a sunburn, but no blisters. Good. After using the damp blanket to wipe down her skin, he applied aloe lotion and tucked a fuzzy blanket around her. As he put the room to rights, he stopped every minute to stroke her gently as she slowly returned to the real world.</p> <p>A tap on the door attracted his attention. The little cleaning woman waited in the doorway. She pointed to herself, then the room, indicating she\u2019d take over the cleanup. Z had probably sent her.</p><p>Raoul nodded, wanting to have Kimberly in his arms. He wrapped her in the subbie blanket, picked her up, then glanced at her folded clothing.</p><p>Peggy whispered, \u201cI\u2019ll leave them and your bag at the bar for you, Master Raoul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Kimberly\u2019s eyes opened, still a little glazed. She smiled at the woman, echoing his words, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Peggy beamed.</p><p>\u201cAh, you are coming back to me now, gatita?\u201d Raoul kissed the top of her head.</p><p>She rubbed her cheek on his chest like a sleepy cat. \u201cI like when you hold me.\u201d</p><p>Dios, she was going to break his heart. \u201cI like when I hold you too.\u201d</p><p>He walked out the hallway and into the main clubroom, wincing as the music of Alice in Chains hammered into his head. Club members who\u2019d watched the fireplay gave him a thumbsup. A few started to talk, realized Kimberly\u2019s still sleepy state, and changed it to a quiet, \u201cGreat scene.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and smiled. Near the bar, he spotted Dahmer and Sam at a table, watching a suspension scene. Back to reality. But they looked engrossed enough that he could take time for Kimberly to rouse further. He caught Sam\u2019s eye, then chose a quieter area, knowing they\u2019d join him when the scene wound down.</p><p>A pretty submissive appeared and set a beer and bottled water on the table. She murmured, \u201cFrom my mistress.\u201d</p><p>Raoul saw that Olivia had taken over the bar. She gave him a small salute and returned to mixing drinks.</p><p>Kim felt...wonderful, everything open and loose and melty.</p><p>\u201cGatita.\u201d A deep, resonant voice sounded as strong as the arms around her. She blinked and smiled up into dark chocolate eyes. Her heart swelled, filling with</p><p>warmth, an infinitely stretchable balloon. Her arm didn\u2019t want to move, but the need to touch surged inside her, demanding action. She put her palm on his cheek and felt how it creased when he smiled.</p><p>\u201cAre you with me here?\u201d</p><p>Always . She opened her mouth to tell him how much she loved him, but a movement from the corner of her eyes silenced her. People. She stiffened, a shard of ice jabbing through her relaxed muscles.</p><p>\u201cNo, look at me, Kimberly,\u201d Master R murmured, pulling her gaze to him. \u201cYou were wonderful, sumisita, and I am very pleased with you.\u201d</p><p>Warmth flowed back into her, a returning tide. God she loved him so much. \u201cBut we\u2019re not alone. We\u2019re still in the Shadowlands, and the other two men will join us shortly. You must stay very quiet.\u201d He nuzzled her cheek. \u201cI hadn\u2019t intended to send you so deep, and I\u2019m not going to leave you alone.\u201d</p><p>Stay quiet. \u201cYes, Master.\u201d</p><p>His lips curved. \u201cGood girl.\u201d</p><p>As he held her, she rubbed her forehead against his muscular chest, wondering fuzzily when she\u2019d come to feel so at home in his arms.</p><p>\u201cThat was an excellent scene, Raoul. Exactly what I need for the auction.\u201d The approaching voice was horrible, greasy, making her feel wrong...ugly...as if she wanted to run. Run and hide. The Overseer.</p><p>She made a sound, and Master R\u2019s arms tightened. He pulled her up slightly, setting his chin on the top of her hair. She pressed her face into his neck, breathing in his clean scent, like a wind off a stormy sea. Masculine. Safe.</p><p>The voices continued to talk around her. She turned her head, determinedly not looking at the slaver. Resting her cheek on Master R\u2019s shoulder, she watched the people and play areas.</p><p>In the closest one, an olive-skinned dom was caning his male sub. The next\u2014a black domme used vampire claws on two subsmissives, male and female, who were wiggling with pain and pleasure.</p><p>Then a six-foot rope spiderweb had a pretty brunette sub tied to it. When she wiggled a foot loose, her face lit with laughter, and she said something\u2014undoubtedly sassy\u2014to her older dom. Without warning, he viciously slapped her face, snapping her head around. The sub turned back to him, her lip bleeding, expression holding pure, horrible shock. And she started crying.</p><p>Kim tried to sit up to go help, but Master R held her too firmly. \u201cShhh,\u201d he said under his breath.</p><p>Jessica stormed over to the scene. The short blonde walked right into the area, said something to the dom, and started to undo the submissive\u2019s restraints. The man, a lean Englishlooking type, shoved her away. She pushed him back, shouted something. And he grabbed her.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Kim fought the arms around her.</p><p>\u201cStop. Now!\u201d Master R growled in her ear.</p><p>She obeyed automatically, then was horrified at her idiocy. What am I doing? She went limp.</p><p>\u201cI thought we\u2019d taught her not to interfere,\u201d the Overseer said in a nasty voice.</p><p>\u201cAfter a scene, the girl doesn\u2019t think too clearly.\u201d Master R added coldly, \u201cShe\u2019ll learn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Master,\u201d she whispered against his neck.</p><p>A tiny pinch on her butt said he wasn\u2019t angry.</p><p>A hefty dom in a gold-trimmed vest walked over\u2014probably the dungeon monitor. The cruel dom scowled, talking to him. Jessica ignored them, busy trying to release the little submissive.</p><p>When Master Z showed up, all activity in that area came to a stop. Man, he was more effective than a police siren.</p><p>Relieved, Kim glanced around. Master Sam had left and was almost to the scene. The Overseer studied the commotion with an...odd...expression on his face.</p><p>Kim turned back. Nothing much different. The English-looking dom pointed at Jessica. Color darkening, she yelled back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Master Z covered her mouth. A second later, he jerked his hand away, and his expression turned to granite. He moved, and Jessica landed hard on her knees. Fisting her hair, he ruthlessly trapped her head against his thigh. Oh boy. She\u2019d actually bit Master Z? God, was she in trouble.</p><p>Master Z didn\u2019t look down. Face still frighteningly cold, he spoke to the jerk of a dom. The man took a step back.</p><p>\u201cAppears the situation is under control,\u201d the Overseer said. When he glanced at Kim, she closed her eyes, burying her face back against Master R\u2019s neck and tuning everything out except the feeling of strength surrounding her. Breath goes in. Breath goes out.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been an interesting visit,\u201d the Overseer said. \u201cEspecially seeing your slave so obedient. Really, Raoul, you\u2019d net a handsome profit if you sold her back to me.\u201d</p><p>Master R laughed lightly. \u201cNot worth the work it would take to start over again.\u201d</p><p>A pause, as if Dahmer wanted to keep trying; then he said, \u201cTraining is a bitch, isn\u2019t it? I\u2019ve been doing some recently, since I still have one of the slaves you met. The redhead didn\u2019t get bought. Older slaves don\u2019t sell well, so I can only hope training will make her more enticing.\u201d</p><p>Linda\u2014going to auction? Oh God. But maybe that was good. When the FBI took them down, she\u2019d be rescued.</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t hurt,\u201d Master R said. \u201cI take it the young one got sold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore\u2019s the pity.\u201d</p><p>Holly. He\u2019s talking about sweet, hopeful Holly. Kim tried to sit up, and the arms around her contracted until she had trouble breathing.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Master R asked politely. \u201cWhat happened to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFar as I can tell, the idiot owner got carried away with seeing blood. He beat her to death.\u201d The Overseer gave an exasperated sigh. \u201cWe made a profit, of course, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s a waste.\u201d Master R sounded as if he didn\u2019t care at all, and Kim hated him. Tears spilled from under her eyelids. How could he be so cold?</p><p>She slowly realized his muscles under and around her were rigid. He was holding himself in check, holding her there as well. His anger was almost palpable.</p><p>\u201cUntil the auction then,\u201d the Overseer said. \u201cI\u2019ll have an area set up to your specifications.\u201d A thump sounded as he set his drink down. \u201cI\u2019ll call you a day or so before to give you the specific date and time. I look forward to seeing how impressed the buyers are with your scene.\u201d</p><p>Silence. She tried to hear if he\u2019d moved away, but the room was too noisy. So she kept herself stiff and quiet. Waiting.</p><p>A minute later, Master R let loose, cursing long and low in a stream of Spanish.</p><p>She\u2019d never heard him sound like that or seen him so furious.</p><p>When she moved, he stopped, and the fury faded from his face. \u201cGatita, I\u2019m sorry about your friend.\u201d He wiped away the tears sliding silently down her cheeks.</p><p>The loosening of his grip released the sobs that had piled up inside her like a thunderstorm. Oh God, Holly. Please God, not Holly. She was too young. She\u2019d told stories about the antics in her dorm at college. About her mother who lived in Alaska. She\u2019d been so homesick and scared; she\u2019d cried herself to sleep every night. How could she be dead?</p><p>Kim tried to curse like Master R but could only cry. She wanted to leave, to hide somewhere quiet, and he wouldn\u2019t let her go. Anger rose, engulfing her. He hadn\u2019t saved Holly; he was a man. I hate you. Her fists stung as she hit him, harder and harder. She choked on the names she called him. As he muffled her screams against his leather vest, she cried some more.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d A man\u2019s voice.</p><p>Kim tried to stop crying, to shut up, and couldn\u2019t.</p> <p>Master R didn\u2019t tell her to be quiet, simply kept holding her. \u201cThe bastard told us a slave was whipped to death. The women were friends.\u201d</p><p>Kim shook, inside and outside. She knew how a whip felt, the tearing of skin, the slicing agony. How scared Holly must have been, pain and more pain. Better it had been me.</p><p>\u201cHell.\u201d The man paused. \u201cYou want to get her out of here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I can\u2019t drive and hold her. She needs to be held right now.\u201d</p><p>Kim\u2019s crying slowed to hiccups, and she leaned against him, exhausted.</p><p>\u201cBe careful, buddy. You look too concerned about a slave, and everyone nearby heard you swearing.\u201d His voice lowered. \u201cDon\u2019t forget we still don\u2019t know who selected our subs for the Harvest Association. He might not be here tonight, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cA good reminder,\u201d Master R said softly. \u201cThank you, my friend. I did forget.\u201d</p><p>Kim pulled a shuddering breath into her lungs and sat up.</p><p>The giant dom bartender was frowning down at them, heavy brows drawn together. He tossed Master\u2019s toy bag and her clothing onto a chair, then met her gaze. \u201cBack with us, love? Good. Keep your master from letting his temper loose.\u201d</p><p>His conviction that she had that power was like a stepping stone away from her sorrow. She needed to stay in her slave character, and she had to look after her dom. \u201cYes, Sir,\u201d she whispered. As she wiped her eyes, she plainly saw Master R\u2019s rage.</p><p>The big dom was right. Master R wasn\u2019t keeping his face under control.</p><p>\u201cMaster,\u201d she said softly. \u201cWe should leave. Will you put my leash on and lead...so I can follow?\u201d</p><p>He looked down. His fingers were infinitely gentle as he touched her cheek. \u201cTesoro m\u00edo,\u201d he said under his breath. \u201cYes, let us go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you get my goods back?\u201d Christopher Greville spoke politely into his cell phone. It might be late to call, but he couldn\u2019t rest without knowing if Dahmer had succeeded.</p><p>Over the past day, he\u2019d come to realize that he was pleased the cunt was still alive. This way, he could deal with her himself\u2014could give her a very slow, excruciatingly painful death.</p><p>\u201cNo, the owner isn\u2019t interested in selling.\u201d Dahmer sounded irritated. \u201cI thought he\u2019d jump at making a profit.\u201d</p><p>A whip of rage struck. Greville\u2019s pulse throbbed painfully in his temple. Who was this fucking buyer? \u201cIn that case, just pick my merchandise up.\u201d Kidnap the bitch. \u201cYou\u2019re an expert at that kind of business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. But only if I can succeed without causing any...upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a damn about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cManagement reacts poorly to bad publicity.\u201d</p><p>Greville hesitated. Last month, when a naive buyer fell in love with his slave and tried to inform on the association, the Harvest Association\u2019s reaction had been...extreme. Removing them would have been adequate. A bullet. Simple enough. But no. Instead, the buyer and slave had been spread-eagled and restrained on the bed, one on top of the other; then the house was set on fire. Before the fire trucks arrived, the entire neighborhood heard them shrieking as they burned to death.</p><p>A bad way to go. He\u2019d thought it funny at the time, but Dahmer\u2019s warning was...perhaps...valid. \u201cDo what you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. If I can\u2019t pick the goods up neatly, I do have another possibility to fall back on, if needed. Be patient, please.\u201d</p><p>Patient! Greville stabbed the Off button as fury seared his nerves. The need to hurt something was so strong he tasted it, but he forced himself to stay at his desk. If he started whipping the slave downstairs, he\u2019d not stop until she was dead.</p><p>Since he was a premium buyer, the Harvest Association didn\u2019t enforce the delay when he killed a slave, but losing two within a short period wouldn\u2019t be wise.</p><p>He waited until his rage had died slightly. Enough, perhaps. Then he rose and headed to the basement. He needed to hurt her, to hear her screams rise to desperation, shriller and shriller.</p><p>His gatita was exhausted. After carrying her into the house, Raoul tucked her into bed and then changed into regular clothes.</p><p>Looking down at the silky black hair surrounding her pale face, he felt the heavy foundations of...something settle slowly into place. He cared for her. Too much. With his history\u2014with hers\u2014this affection could only be a mistake, as foolish as building a bridge without considering the wind. He needed to back away while he still could.</p><p>Her eyes opened. She stared at his bedroom, her relief to be home obvious. Hearing about Holly had been too much, like stretching copper wire past the fracture point.</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d he asked, wanting to touch her. Comfort her. Yet hadn\u2019t he just told himself to pull away? Stupid Sandoval. She\u2019d slipped past his defenses so easily.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Her chin rose. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>As she attempted to appear strong, to lie to him with her body and her words, irritation scraped his already raw nerves. \u201cDo you ever tell me the truth when you\u2019re not feeling well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d Her brows drew together even as her arms wrapped around her waist, comforting herself as if she didn\u2019t believe he could do a good job. \u201cI think I know myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you not trust me enough to be honest?\u201d He set his jaw, knowing\u2014knowing neither of them was thinking clearly\u2014yet after what they\u2019d shared, having her lie to him was like a stab in the back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When her mouth firmed, he prepared himself for another untruth. Perhaps that was good; he\u2019d have an excuse to leave her here with her dishonesty, her inability to be the submissive he wanted her to be\u2014his inability to accept her even if she was. This was a way to pull away before they both got hurt. He started to turn\u2014</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Her fingers pushed the blanket into folds, straightened it out again. \u201cMom didn\u2019t\u2014my father was cruel, made fun of her whenever she complained\u2014so she stopped. And I learned\u2014\u201d She bit her lip and stared at the covers. Folding. Straightening. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to lie to you. It just slips out.\u201d</p><p>Dios. Raoul took a step forward, even as his brain told him to leave. To back away before he had more cables binding him than he could escape. \u201cKimberly...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not fine, Master. At all.\u201d She looked up finally, and her eyes swam with tears. \u201cI\u2019m scared to be alone. Only I\u2019m going to cry some more, and I didn\u2019t want you to have to...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo get all wet?\u201d Nothing in the world could have kept him from sitting on the bed and pulling her into his arms. \u201cSumisita\u2014cry. I\u2019ll hold you.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders were already shaking. So fragile to bear what she\u2019d been through, and now to add grief to the mix. His own heart ached when he remembered the young victim, Holly. If he ever gained the opportunity to fight the slavers, some of them would die. But for now, his duty was to be a little subbie\u2019s support and comfort.</p><p>She cried for a long time, long enough to soak his T-shirt, and so violently that a couple of times she\u2019d started to gag, and he\u2019d shaken her out of it.</p><p>When her crying finally stilled and only an occasional shudder coursed through her body, Raoul\u2019s arms were still wrapped firmly around her. The tightness was gone from her muscles; the horror had faded from her eyes. \u201cAll right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fi\u2014\u201d She choked on a laugh and amended, \u201cI\u2019m better. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He tilted her head up and kissed her, tasting the salt of her tears, the sweetness of her lips. She softened under his careful assault, then kissed him back, as if she needed the distraction\u2014the affirmation of life\u2014as much as he did.</p><p>He slid her off his lap, laid her against the pillows, and took her mouth again. His fingers tangled lightly in her hair, firmly enough to remind her who he was yet not rough enough to resurrect bad memories. He\u2019d learned how to walk that tightrope over the past weeks. As he hardened, he deepened the kiss.</p><p>She wore nothing. The conviction that a submissive\u2019s body should be accessible to her master reverberated through him. For tonight at least, he would accept his role.</p><p>He ran his finger over the scar on her ribs, then up. Her breast fit into his palm, lush and soft. He pulled back far enough to watch her. He couldn\u2019t trust her to tell him if she was afraid or repelled, and he was no mind reader like Z. But when he studied her face, the changes of her muscles and her hands, he\u2019d discover if she was fearful\u2014or aroused.</p><p>Tonight, everything he saw spoke of desire: her lips and nipples reddening, the flush on her cheeks, the hitch in her breath when he cupped her breast. His gatita had responsive nipples, not overly sensitive, but sweetly erogenous zones. He licked a circle around one and then blew on it, smiling as it peaked.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you smiling about?\u201d she asked, her gaze on his face as soft as her hand in his hair.</p><p>\u201cWomen\u2019s breasts are fascinating. The way they wobble and move. How your nipples bunch up as if they had a mind of their own.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes, then gasped as he pinched the neglected nipple into action.</p><p>\u201cOf course, men have their own independently acting parts.\u201d He pressed his hard cock against her thigh.</p><p>She lightened his heart with a tiny snicker and stole it altogether when she set her hand on his cheek and asked, \u201cWhy can you make me laugh, even when I\u2019m naked and a little scared?\u201d She pulled his tear-dampened shirt away from his skin. \u201cSeems like all you get from me is wet clothes.\u201d</p><p>He abandoned her long enough to pull the shirt over his head and toss it aside, then removed his pants. He put her hand back on his shoulder. \u201cTouch me, cari\u00f1o.\u201d</p><p>Her soft palm ran over his chest, then paused when he pushed her legs apart.</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d He\u2019d been careful to avoid the missionary position, never wanting to make her feel pinned down or restrained by his size or body. Tonight\u2014tonight, with her emotions still high and the bond from their scene strong between them, he\u2019d push her further and try to replace the sordid memories with brighter ones.</p><p>He moved his body over hers, staying poised above her, but putting no weight on her. Fear widened her eyes. Her hand flattened against his chest to push him away.</p> <p>\u201cLook at me, sumisita m\u00eda,\u201d he repeated softly.</p><p>Her gaze met his, and the tenseness slid from her body. \u201cMaster R,\u201d she whispered, confirming what her sight told her.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He smiled and bit her chin, enjoying the sweet gasp. \u201cI want your hand on my cock. Touch me, gatita.\u201d</p><p>Still holding her eyes, he took her hand and put it on him. At the sensation of her small fingers curling around him, his shaft surged even fuller with blood. \u201cYou have a soft touch. Stroke me,\u201d he directed.</p><p>Not looking away, she moved her grip up and set her fingers on top of his piercing. Her thumb wiggled the part on the underside.</p><p>The sensation was so heady, his eyes closed for a moment as he fought himself. This one, the one woman who needed his self-control the most, was the one who challenged him more than any other. Pulling his attention from the glide of her fingers around him, he balanced on one arm and his knees and reached down between her thighs. No weight on her yet\u2014just his size looming over her was enough for the moment.</p><p>He smiled when his fingers touched her pussy. How she kept herself shaved bare for him, without him having to order it, was a delight. His voice came out low and ragged. \u201cYou\u2019re wet for me, gatita.\u201d</p><p>Her olive cheeks darkened with a flush, enough for keen eyes to note. Despite the slickness, her clit was still hidden in its hood, and he considered teasing her with a toy, then knew he wouldn\u2019t move from this spot. Tonight was for their bodies only, no ties or cuffs, no toys.</p><p>Of course, the lack of tools didn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t indulge in a little mental bondage. \u201cSpread your legs farther apart,\u201d he said.</p><p>Kim stared up at Master R, a shiver running through her. He was so big, could easily hurt her. And now\u2014</p><p>\u201cMust I repeat myself?\u201d he asked, his voice lowering to a smooth threat. His eyes were dark, dark brown.</p><p>Her knees separated more, her folds pulling apart, exposing her. He smiled and swirled his finger around her opening, spreading the wetness. So wet. She shivered as he dipped his head, taking one nipple into his mouth, even as his touch edged nearer her clit. Needed more. Her hips tilted up slightly.</p><p>His head lifted. He studied her for a long moment. \u201cNo, you get only what I choose to give you. I will not tie you tonight, sumisita m\u00eda, but you will put your left hand so...\u201d He firmly curled her fingers around one of the metal swirls on the headboard. \u201cYour legs stay open\u2014no matter what I do.\u201d He smiled into her eyes. \u201cYour other hand can continue to please me until I say otherwise.\u201d</p><p>Her pulse picked up.</p><p>\u201cDo you understand?\u201d</p><p>Mouth dry, she managed a nod.</p><p>\u201cKimberly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head no.</p><p>Her voice became huskier. \u201cYes, Master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch better.\u201d He rewarded her with a slow kiss, a demanding one. When his tongue took possession, she could only think of the last time his cock pushed into her, filling her like that. He abandoned her mouth and inched down her body. A tiny bite on her nipple fragmented her mind. A light pinch on her clit made her gasp. Both pains, so similar, sent need streaming like a riptide between the two points. She was still tender from his attentions during the scene, and his fingers were slightly abrasive...and it only pushed her higher.</p><p>Keep arm over head, she told herself. Legs open. Her hips\u2014the one wiggle that escaped her was rewarded with a nasty nip on the underside of her breast and made her gasp, increasing the feeling of being washed away in need.</p><p>His finger pressed into her entrance, a small stretch, then slid over her clit, repeating the motions. Her labia swelled and throbbed. Her clit tightened. Each time became more intense. The teasing hint of his finger in her vagina made her remember being filled completely, made her need... She wiggled again.</p><p>He lifted his head and gave her that unyielding dom look that melted her insides into a puddle. One corner of his mouth turned up. \u201cAre you having problems, gatita?\u201d</p><p>Her glare should have burned his eyelashes to stubby ash. \u201cWould you just fuck me already?\u201d</p><p>His dark sexy laugh burst out, so infectious, she couldn\u2019t keep a giggle back.</p><p>After pulling himself from her grip, he lowered his hips. His cock pressed on her open pussy; his pelvis touched hers; his chest touched her breasts. Fear slammed into her like someone had broken down a door, pushing all the\u2014</p><p>\u201cLook at me, Kimberly,\u201d he said ruthlessly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She realized her eyes had shut. She opened them to meet his indomitable gaze.</p><p>\u201cKeep your eyes open and on mine. And both hands on the headboard.\u201d</p><p>She realized she was pushing him away. Oh. She lifted her arm and grabbed another wire on the headboard. The position arched her breasts up and rubbed her nipples across the hair on his chest, making her toes curl with the sensation.</p><p>He positioned his cock and pressed into her, the metal piercing like a blunt finger inside on the front of her vagina, the sensation so intense her vision blurred.</p><p>\u201cOpen. Your. Eyes.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. He held her gaze as he was sliding in, stretching her, every inch setting new nerves into a clamor of need. Her hips gave the slightest wiggle.</p><p>\u201cIf you move again\u201d\u2014his whisper made the threat even more potent\u2014\u201cI will tie you up and leave you alone to suffer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. I\u2019m trying. Masterrrr.\u201d The whine horrified her and made him smile. Drown him.</p><p>\u201cSo you are.\u201d He paused to lick her nipples, then rubbed his chest against her sideways, the abrasive feeling on her hard wet peaks mesmerizing.</p><p>He held his hips still, moving only his upper torso, and her insides throbbed with the need for more. She wanted to rub against him, all over, to push her hips up and... Don\u2019t move.</p><p>She forced her muscles to relax, to stillness, even as everything burned, demanding action. The need to keep a portion of her mind separate to command her body distracted her, increased her arousal. Her clit felt the size of her fist, screaming for him to touch it.</p><p>He watched her, then smiled, easing out of her slowly. The metal ball rubbed against something sensitive inside her with an exquisite, almost painful pressure.</p><p>A slow push back in, and a shudder ran through her. Don\u2019t move, don\u2019t move. Oh God, I\u2019m going to die. \u201cOh, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease is a nice word,\u201d he said agreeably. And he pushed in again, faster\u2014just a little faster, his eyes intent on her, then flickering over her face, her arms and hands. More, more, more. She wanted to lift her hips, make him go deeper, go faster.</p><p>\u201cSpeak to me, gatita. You need to work on communicating your emotions, and this is a good place to start.\u201d He slid out, tilting his hips so that damned ball scraped across something inside her, and the waves of her arousal turned into a heavy surf.</p><p>Boiling and churning. \u201cHarder. More. God...\u201d</p><p>The flash of his smile made her heart skip, and then he slammed into her.</p><p>Oh wonderful hardness. \u201cMore, more, more.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cVery expressive.\u201d But he complied, hammering into her, and she knew somewhere it should be frightening, only she was so, so close that the driving rhythm only spiraled her up. Up. His big hand slid under her butt to lift her so every withdrawal rubbed his pelvis over her clit.</p><p>\u201cOh, oh\u2014\u201d Her breathing stopped. More, please, more. His cock slammed in, penetrating far inside her and scraping that damned piercing over her G-spot, and his groin rubbed her clit. He was so big, and everything she felt, everything he did expanded into pure sensation, and a depth charge of pleasure exploded, brilliant and hot, the fiery waves expanding everywhere.</p><p>She gasped for breath as another intense wave hit. Sparkles danced in front of her eyes. Her fingers and toes tingled.</p><p>Laughing slightly, he nuzzled her neck and shoved into her, deep, deep, hard, and his erection thickened, then was jerking inside her.</p><p>He was over her, surrounding her, filling her, his heat, his breath, his scent, drowning her in him.</p> <p>Her heart turned over. \u201cGod, I love you.\u201d</p><p>Silence. Oh, a bad silence, growing worse the longer it lengthened. He lifted his head, and the languorous expression of satiation disappeared with his concern. Leaning on one arm, letting his hips pin her down, he pushed her hair from her damp face. \u201cThis is not...wise, gatita.\u201d He sighed, stroking her cheek with one finger. Not evading her eyes, not trying to pretend he hadn\u2019t heard her\u2014not Master R.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d she whispered, even knowing the answer. Some of it.</p><p>\u201cYou are not...healed, not ready to know your heart.\u201d His fleeting smile wasn\u2019t reflected in his eyes. \u201cIt would be wrong of me to permit this.\u201d</p><p>Could the master command her heart?</p><p>But he didn\u2019t want her. She heard that clearly. How could her body shimmer with satisfaction even as her emotions were disappearing into a hole of blackness? Her brief smile reflected his. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Just the heat of the moment, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He kissed her lips gently, then rolled them both over, his hand curved over her bottom keeping them together with him still inside her. He settled her on top of him, guiding her head down into the curve of his shoulder. \u201cSleep. We\u2019ll discuss this in the morning.\u201d</p><p>No. No, I don\u2019t think we will. His skin was warm and damp under her cheek, and she inhaled the fragrance of him and sex. She\u2019d survived kidnapping and slavery and the loss of friends. She\u2019d survive this as well\u2014but damned if she\u2019d talk about it.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d Remembering Kimberly\u2019s soft avowal, Raoul abandoned the brewing coffee and walked outside to stare at the water. The brisk morning air ruffled his hair but didn\u2019t bring him any clarity of thought. How could he have let her get emotionally involved with him? This wasn\u2019t\u2014she shouldn\u2019t love him. Dios, she should be running the other direction.</p><p>Only he knew better. She was tough, brave, and resilient. He\u2019d known women who reacted with hysterics to a fender bender. Had her father taught her to be so durable? Or her mother? Had Kimberly lived with an example of how to survive abuse?</p><p>He rubbed his hand over his mouth. She was confusing emotional dependence and need with love. How should he handle this? Carefully, Sandoval. Like walking a girder with no safety line.</p><p>The problem was he cared for her, and he had no excuse that he\u2019d been mistreated. No, his mistake was to have let her into his house, his life. His heart. He\u2019d grown so fond of her that he had trouble imagining his home without her bubbly presence.</p><p>Don\u2019t go there, Sandoval. She\u2019d leave as soon as the auction was over, and according to the Overseer, that might occur in a week or so.</p><p>The realization was like a gut shot from a steel rivet. He\u2019d miss their showers. The workouts in the weight room. The fighting as he taught her to cripple and maim, and the unholy light in her eyes when she\u2019d mastered a technique. The evenings watching television, arguing over movies. Her snippy backtalk, and how she tried to hide her pleasure at serving him.</p><p>The way she softened under his hands when he kissed her. He felt himself harden. Good job, Sandoval.</p><p>Well, he\u2019d see this through. And try to keep them both from being stupid.</p><p>As he turned to go back in, he wondered if she\u2019d want to stay with him when this was over. No. She truly was submissive, but she\u2019d made it clear, over and over, that she didn\u2019t want to live the lifestyle. And she needed to heal. Once her head was on straight, she wouldn\u2019t want a master. Not soon, probably never.</p><p>Even if miracles occurred, he wasn\u2019t ready for a relationship either. It was far too soon. And this time, he wouldn\u2019t settle for anything less than a full-time Dominant/submissive relationship with someone who wanted it as much as he did.</p><p>Over the waves, a gull gave a long screech as another stole its fish. He headed into the house. He\u2019d need a massive amount of caffeine to figure out a way to pull back before he hurt her further.</p><p>Kim frowned at the sunlight streaming in the balcony window, then glanced at the clock on the bedside table. Noon? No wonder Master R had already gotten up.</p><p>The empty space beside her in bed sent a pang through her. She\u2019d come to like waking up with Master R\u2019s solid body next to hers, or for him to awaken her as he had almost every morning since they\u2019d had real sex. His hands would caress her breasts, and his cock would ease between her legs from behind. He\u2019d hold her in place, gently, firmly, and push into her. She\u2019d start off groggy, but when his clever fingers would slide over her clit, she\u2019d be right onboard with early morning sex. Who knew it could be so much fun?</p><p>Not this morning. She sighed and climbed out of bed,</p><p>But last night, she\u2019d said she loved him, and he hadn\u2019t exactly looked thrilled to hear she cared.</p><p>With a frown, she stepped into the shower, missing his presence there too. The teasing, his laughter. The one morning he hadn\u2019t taken her in bed, he\u2019d made up for it a few minutes later.</p><p>Her lips curved. That time she\u2019d told him she wasn\u2019t interested in shower sex. \u201cNot today.\u201d God, so not the thing to tell a dom.</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d he\u2019d said with that amused\u2014stern\u2014look in his eyes. \u201cDoes a submissive have that choice?\u201d</p><p>Before she\u2019d realized how much trouble she was in, he\u2019d grasped her around the waist, walked out of the shower, and laid her on the cold counter. He pinned her legs to his shoulders, put his mouth on her pussy, and forced her to have an orgasm, waited a second, then did it again. She was dizzy when he pulled her back into the shower. And then, being the dom he was, he\u2019d firmly bent her over and taken her from behind. Hard.</p><p>Why did she get off on that control? She soaped her body, snorting at how her nipples had bunched up. Yep, just thinking of him did it for her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But he doesn\u2019t want my love.</p><p>Was he right about her? Did she imagine love when it was really only need? Maybe. She dried off. She didn\u2019t feel needy. Well, perhaps a little.</p><p>A pair of her jeans, underwear, and a tank top lay on the towel bar. Apparently Master R had decided she could wear clothes today. Her hand hesitated over the clothing. Today\u2014or every day now? Her job was done, wasn\u2019t it? The entire charade had been to get Sam referred during the Overseer\u2019s follow-up visit.</p><p>Even if Sam failed and Master R had to attend the auction, he\u2019d use an FBI agent as his submissive. Not me.</p> <p>Her relief was balanced by the ugly vision of Master R with another woman. Would he spank the submissive? Make her come? Of course he would. The flood of sheer jealousy appalled her. God, I need to get out of here.</p><p>When she entered the kitchen a few minutes later, Master R sat on a bar stool at the island, newspapers and coffee before him. She started to speak, then saw the phone he held to his ear.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he was saying. \u201cSam said Dahmer called a few minutes ago. His background check passed, and he should get an invitation to the auction sometime this week.\u201d</p><p>That meant the job was done. Kim hugged herself, trying to process her emotions. After her first scuba dive, she\u2019d hauled herself up the boat\u2019s steps, shucked off the heavy air tank, and dropped the belt with twenty pounds of lead weights. She\u2019d felt as if she might float away. Very much like now. My part is over.</p><p>Master R listened and then grinned. \u201cYes, he put on quite a show. Had one of the better screamers.\u201d He glanced at her, his eyes shadowed but approving. \u201cKimberly did her job perfectly.\u201d</p> <p>A glow sparked to life and was snuffed out with his next words. \u201cSince Sam is accepted, I think she should move to Gabi\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>Kim stared at him. A slap in the face wouldn\u2019t have hurt as much. What had she done wrong?</p><p>\u201cNo, she didn\u2019t do anything wrong. But keeping her in a Master/slave relationship as she recovers from being kidnapped would be foolish. She\u2019s getting dependent on me, Kouros.\u201d He met her eyes squarely, not trying to hide anything.</p><p>Anger started to overtake the pain. Yes, she could hate him.</p><p>\u201cNo, she doesn\u2019t need to stay here. Her job is finished. Even if Sam\u2019s invitation falls through, I\u2019d use one of your people for the demo, not Kimberly. I would never take her to a slave auction. We discussed this already.\u201d His eyes turned cold. \u201cSend her to Gabi\u2019s. She\u2019s done enough.\u201d</p><p>Good to know. Trying not to scowl, Kim poured herself some coffee.</p> <p>Master R straightened suddenly. \u201cWhen was this?\u201d</p><p>The sharpness in his voice made Kim jump, and she hissed as coffee scalded her fingers. She set the cup down hastily, shaking her hand. Ouch.</p><p>\u201cKimberly!\u201d Master R pointed to the faucet.</p><p>She hesitated. But I want to hear. Caving in, she ran the cold water over her reddened fingers. Over the noise of the water, she heard him say, \u201cI\u2019m putting you on speaker. She has a right to know.\u201d He set the phone on the island.</p><p>Know what?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a stubborn bastard, Sandoval,\u201d came a man\u2019s sonorous voice with the broadened A sound of someone from Maine. \u201cMiss Moore, I was telling your master why I don\u2019t want you to return to Gabi\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. I don\u2019t know this man. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if Raoul ever told you, but we planted surveillance devices around the neighborhood. A simple precaution to keep you safe.\u201d</p> <p>Her jaw dropped, and she stared at the walls. What had they seen?</p><p>\u201cNo, gatita,\u201d Master R said. \u201cThey\u2019re only outside\u2014the front and sides of the house, and one on the patio pointing toward the beach.\u201d</p><p>The FBI agent snorted. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t permit anything else. We\u2019ve spotted a few people watching your house since Raoul bought you. Very casual. But earlier today, a private investigator checked you out and took pictures.\u201d</p><p>Kim wrapped her arms around herself, a chill running through her. The outside world wasn\u2019t safe. She already knew that.</p><p>\u201cWith the prior surveillance they did, they\u2019d know you spend a lot of time outside. If you suddenly disappear, but Raoul is still in the house, they\u2019d wonder why.\u201d</p><p>Watching the house. Ice crawled up her spine. \u201cWhat if they try to take me back?\u201d God, that was stupid. They wouldn\u2019t steal from their own buyer.</p><p>\u201cKidnapping a slave they\u2019d sold wouldn\u2019t be good for business.\u201d The FBI agent paused. \u201cIf it helps your worries, though, the neighborhood is well policed and has a neighborhood watch. Raoul has a hell of a security system on both the house and grounds, much better than the one at Marcus\u2019s place. Nobody in their right minds would try to breech it.\u201d</p><p>Master R gave her a small smile and whispered, \u201cI grew up on the streets, remember?\u201d</p><p>Huh. She\u2019d seen him making the rounds before bed, checking on stuff, and hadn\u2019t bothered to ask why. So she was safe here. But to stay?</p><p>Master R remained silent, obviously giving her the choice. I hate making decisions. She wanted to go to Gabi\u2019s...yet even if he didn\u2019t care for her, she wanted to be with him.</p><p>With an effort, she pushed her personal baggage to the side. Her wishes were irrelevant. No matter what she felt, she mustn\u2019t do anything to cause suspicions and blow the investigation. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll be here for another few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Miss Moore. I look forward to meeting you later this week.\u201d</p><p>With a low curse, Master R slid the phone shut; then his eyes narrowed on her. \u201cWill you be all right with this?\u201d</p><p>I might never be right again. \u201cOf course.\u201d She winced when his brows drew together. Telling the complete truth surely sucked at times. \u201cAll right, it\u2019s difficult, being so unsettled. I want to go home and get on with my life. See my mom.\u201d Stay with you. Run from you. Love you.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He took a sip of his coffee, and the release of his intent gaze was like escaping a riptide. \u201cYou must miss your mam\u00e1 very much.\u201d</p><p>His voice held a wealth of understanding, and the tenderness with which he\u2019d said \u201cmam\u00e1\u201d told her a lot. And left more unexplained. She frowned. \u201cI thought your family lived in Tampa. Did you tell them not to visit?\u201d</p><p>His mouth tightened. \u201cWe do not...speak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t approve of my BDSM lifestyle. At all. When they found out... They\u2019d probably have reacted better if I\u2019d been gay.\u201d He rubbed his face. He might have thought his expression unreadable, but it wasn\u2019t. Being alienated from his family hurt him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He was so loving. To have his family push him away must have been terrible.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your problem, gatita.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI s\u2019pose not.\u201d She watched the coffee in her cup, making the black liquid swirl in circles. Like my life. He said she shouldn\u2019t be in a Master/slave relationship, and that she\u2019d become dependent on him. Maybe he was right. \u201cMaster R?\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we live together as...as friends? No more of the master\u2014sumisita stuff?</p><p>His frown cleared. \u201cWe can. It\u2019s a good plan.\u201d He tapped his fingers on his papers and then looked at her again. \u201cYou may have the guest bedroom as before.\u201d</p><p>No more being wrapped in his arms at night? The kitchen seemed to darken. \u201cGreat. I\u2019ll go move my stuff.\u201d</p><p>Her knees held up nicely all the way to Master\u2019s\u2014no, Raoul\u2019s\u2014bedroom. She bundled together the clothing Gabi had given her and left the French maid\u2019s costume in the closet for him to return to Z. After tossing everything on the bed in the guest room, she went back for her toiletries.</p><p>She turned her eyes away from the shower, refusing to remember how his big hands felt moving over her soap-slicked body. Warm and firm. No. One more week; then it was over. She\u2019d go home and...do what? Aside from wanting to see her mom, she\u2019d never thought about after that.</p><p>Her knees went weak, and she leaned on the counter, staring at herself in the mirror. I should want to go home. To take up my life again. Her friends would be overjoyed at her return.</p><p>Had her position at the marine lab been filled? Probably not\u2014admin moved slowly. She\u2019d go see them first thing and... A chill ran through her. What if she stepped out of the office or her house and...they took her again? I have to go back to work. No choice. She\u2019d manage. She always did.</p><p>But she\u2019d be so far from Tampa. How could she stand each day without Master R in it?</p><p>Her hands clenched. Getting a little dependent, missy? Or a little in love? Her inner cynic was so sarcastic that if it\u2019d been a person, she\u2019d have slapped its face. Because the answer to both questions was yes.</p><p>He...lifted her heart. She wanted to take care of him, put that special smile on his face, be there for him the way he\u2019d been here for her. And why not? He obviously cared for her. He did.</p><p>Only...he hadn\u2019t exactly said \u201cI love you\u201d back to her.</p><p>Even if he did, they had differing goals. He was a master, and eventually he\u2019d want a real slave, not a pretender. Cold seeped like a chill morning fog into her bones. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m not a slave. That wasn\u2019t the relationship she\u2019d dreamed of\u2014to kneel at a man\u2019s feet, to take his orders, to serve him. She hauled in a shuddering breath. I don\u2019t belong here. Not really.</p><p>She needed to not pine after something that would never work. They\u2019d be friends like she said.</p><p>After she finished moving her stuff, she went back downstairs. Master R\u2014Raoul, dammit\u2014was still in the kitchen, making notes on a legal pad. Why did he have to be so...so wonderful? The broad shoulders, the strong hands, the stern jaw. Why wasn\u2019t life fair?</p><p>He looked up, and his smile faded as he got a I-can-see-right-down-to-your-secrets expression on his face. \u201cGatita, what is wrong?\u201d</p> <p>She shrugged. \u201cLeftover nerves, I think.\u201d She rubbed at a smear on the floor with her shoe and asked casually, \u201cDo we have any plans for this week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly one. To keep you safe until you go home.\u201d</p><p>Go home. How strange he\u2019d mention that after she\u2019d been thinking about it. Go home to what?</p><p>\u201cFor today, I thought we\u2019d celebrate surviving our evening with the Overseer. I keep a sailboat at a marina nearby, and we can pick up a picnic lunch.\u201d</p><p>Be on the water again and be with Master R? Could anything be better? \u201cOh, yes. Please.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood enough. After I change, we\u2019ll head out. Meantime, can you get my toy bag out of the car?\u201d He tossed his keys to her. \u201cI don\u2019t like driving around with it...just in case of an accident or police. The car\u2019s parked in front.\u201d</p><p>She managed to stifle the yes, Master and said, \u201cSure, I\u2019ll get it.\u201d Why hadn\u2019t he parked in the garage last night? Because he\u2019d had to carry her upstairs. Duh. And the garage was on the opposite side of the house.</p><p>As she crossed the great room, Master R started up the stairs.</p><p>She stopped. Wait. Go outside? By myself? \u201cUm. I\u2019ll... I\u2019m not sure I know what your bag looks like.\u201d Her chest felt as if someone was wrapping ropes around her ribs and kept drawing them tighter.</p><p>He leaned one hip against the stair railing. \u201cIt\u2019s the only bag in the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGet the bag, gatita.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t move.</p><p>His eyes narrowed, and then he came back down the stairs.</p><p>She relaxed. \u201cYou\u2019re going to escort me to your car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d His hand closed around her upper arm. He led her to the front and pushed her out the door.</p><p>She stood, stunned at his actions. Stood and stared down the curving drive. She could see the street\u2014the street where anyone might wait. Where someone could shoot her and hurt her and cage her. \u201cNo!\u201d No no no. She spun around and plowed into an immovable body.</p><p>He blocked the doorway, the light framing him, a dark angel. \u201cKimberly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, I won\u2019t.\u201d She was trembling so violently that her knees buckled.</p> <p>His arms closed around her, and he held her firmly. \u201cTake a slow breath, gatita. Now.\u201d</p><p>She was cold, so cold. That was why she was shaking. Her fingers had even gone numb.</p><p>\u201cAnother breath. Let it out slowly.\u201d He made her take a few more.</p><p>Her heart slowed. And she realized she\u2019d just had another damned panic attack for whatever reason.</p><p>\u201cNow look at me.\u201d</p><p>The order couldn\u2019t be refused. She lifted her gaze to his intense dark brown eyes. His expression seemed strange. Concern and anger and...pity?</p><p>How the hell dare he pity me? She straightened in his arms and took a terrifying step away. \u201cI\u2019m just stressed from yesterday. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen perhaps you should try again?\u201d</p><p>No!</p><p>But he held his hand out, and she set her fingers in his.</p><p>He walked to the car, and she was all right. Yes, she was fine.</p><p>He released her hand. \u201cStay here for a moment, gatita.\u201d</p><p>When he started toward the house, somehow she was beside him, so close she was almost crawling into his clothes.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Without speaking further, he led her through the house, out the back onto the patio. He stopped by the pool, watching her closely. She wrapped her arms around herself, trying to figure out why she was still shaking and why she couldn\u2019t go outside. She\u2019d been outside before.</p><p>He pointed to the beach ball on the other side of the pool. \u201cBring me that.\u201d No problem. She\u2019d only gone halfway when he called her back.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re afraid of being outside\u2014on the street side\u2014by yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2014\u201d She pulled in a breath of salt air, turned away from him. The waves rolled onto the shore; clouds puffed high in the sky. Normal world. Abnormal Kim. Her voice came out so tiny, he leaned forward to hear her. \u201cWhen I went out to the front, I just knew they were there. They\u2019d take me back. It\u2019s not safe outside.\u201d Everything inside told her that was truth.</p><p>\u201cThe patio is all right though? And the beach?\u201d he asked softly, still holding her hand.</p><p>\u201cI...guess so. It\u2019s got a fence. An ocean. No vehicles. They can\u2019t get me there.\u201d She blew a lock of hair away from her face. \u201cIt sounds stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKimberly, where did they kidnap you?\u201d</p><p>She remembered all too well. Every month, she\u2019d drive from Savannah to Atlanta to spend the day with her mom. Then she\u2019d spend the evening at the BDSM club. The highlight of her month. \u201cOutside a club. When I reached for the handle of my car, I\u2014I... The man Tasered me.\u201d Horrible pain, every muscle spasming, convulsing, screaming silently in agony. \u201cThey tossed me into a van.\u201d</p><p>He stroked her hair. \u201cNow you figured out why you panic, does it help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d Yet the thought of walking out a door again made her whole body tense in dread. She straightened her spine. \u201cTry again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrave gatita.\u201d Hand on her arm, he led her to the front door as if she were a blind woman. \u201cLet\u2019s see how far you can get.\u201d</p><p>She forced her feet to step outside. A long drive. The street. Something squeezed her chest, and black wavered like ghosts around the edges of her vision.</p><p>\u201cKimberly!\u201d The command in his voice was as effective as a vicious slap.</p><p>She jolted and looked over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here. Nothing is going to happen to you.\u201d Fury came from him in waves, but it wasn\u2019t directed at her. \u201cTake three steps. Then we\u2019ll go back in the house. Can you do that?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. Too far.</p><p>\u201cKimberly.\u201d He met her eyes, raised his chin. \u201cDo it\u2014for me.\u201d</p><p>For Master R. Her need to please warred with the fear. She eyed all the open space where she\u2019d be exposed, the places someone could hide, and something tiny inside her quailed. Yet she took a step. Another. Her courage failed. She could only stand and shake.</p><p>\u201cOne more, gatita.\u201d</p><p>Her air was gone, and red streaked the lawn as she pushed a foot forward. One more.</p><p>\u201cGood. Eyes on me.\u201d He was in front of her so quickly, she realized he\u2019d been right behind her for each step. His face blocked the dangerous open lawn. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of you, Kimberly.\u201d</p><p>His praise released the last few bands around her chest, and she hauled in a breath.</p><p>\u201cNext time you\u2019ll go four steps. In the meantime\u201d\u2014he held his hand out for hers\u2014\u201cwe\u2019ll get my toy bag out of the car. Together.\u201d</p><p>Three days of being friends wasn\u2019t all it was cracked up to be. With a silent sigh, Kim watched the morning sun move across the bedroom carpet, her hand over the wide palm cupping her breast. Contentment was being held in Master R\u2019s arms.</p><p>But...she wouldn\u2019t be here if she hadn\u2019t crawled into his bed in the middle of the night.</p><p>He\u2019d made love to her. She grinned. She\u2019d kinda started the process when she\u2019d sneaked under the covers, run her hands up his thighs, and fondled his cock to hardness. At first, she\u2019d thought he was asleep, but after a few minutes, she realized he\u2019d been awake all along, waiting to discover how far she\u2019d go.</p><p>Far . Giggling, she\u2019d climbed on top of him, and it had been fun. He\u2019d kissed her and stroked her. Sucked her nipples. But he hadn\u2019t taken control, hadn\u2019t demanded anything from her. His hands had been gentle, not firm. They\u2019d both gotten off, but... She sighed. The sex hadn\u2019t been exciting at all. Kind of like piloting a motorboat instead of sailing in a strong wind. You\u2019d get to your destination with the one; the other was sheer exhilaration.</p><p>I want that kind of sex back.</p><p>Master R was still asleep, one arm over her, spooned around her from behind. His morning erection pressed against her bottom. So...</p><p>They could have boring, we\u2019re-just-friends sex, but she wanted more. How far could a girl push a master before he lost his temper?</p><p>He didn\u2019t get angry easily. She bit her lip, unease quivering her nerves, and then rolled out of his arms. \u201cNo!\u201d she snapped as his eyes opened. \u201cNo sex. You can\u2019t make me, and I don\u2019t want it.\u201d</p><p>When his darkly tanned face turned stern, her stomach spawned wiggly minnows. But then he relaxed. \u201cNo, I won\u2019t make you do anything you don\u2019t want, Kimberly.\u201d He put his hands behind his head, although his muscles were tight. \u201cGo shower. I\u2019ll stay out of your way.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dammit. After flipping her braid away, she poked his shoulder forcefully enough to hurt her finger. \u201cYou don\u2019t tell me what to do, Ra-oool. I\u2019m not your property anymore.\u201d She\u2019d expected the blaze in his eyes; she hadn\u2019t anticipated her regret at verbalizing the fact. I\u2019m not his. She poked him harder to make the sense of loss go away.</p><p>He grabbed her hand, preventing more abuse, and sat up. \u201cThat\u2019s enough. Get out of the bed before I lose my patience with your rudeness.\u201d His voice had lowered, and excitement shimmered deep inside her.</p><p>She felt her nipples bunching into peaks, saw his gaze drop to her breasts, and her anticipation increased at the flare of heat in his eyes. \u201cStop bossing me around.\u201d She planted herself deliberately, kneeling with her butt on her feet. \u201cI\u2019m not going to do anything you say. Ever. Even if you beg me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what if you beg me?\u201d he asked softly, the increasing Spanish accent an obvious clue to his temper. \u201cIf you stay in this bed, I will take you, Kimberly, the way I want, as rough as I want, unless you scream your safe word.\u201d</p> <p>His dark voice flipped a switch inside her, and she was suddenly very wet, her clit throbbing as if he\u2019d stroked it with his tongue rather than his words.</p><p>But her mouth had gone dry at the threat in his voice. He would... He could hurt her. Only, she wanted that. Kind of. She took a breath. Besides, backing down would make her a coward. \u201cTake me, Ra-oool? Pfft. You\u2019re all talk and no\u2014\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her. She squeaked as he flattened her on her belly, her face on the mattress inches from the ornate ironwork of the headboard. She felt a pull on her hair. Tugging.</p><p>\u201cThat should keep you out of trouble.\u201d He yanked her up, onto her hands and knees.</p><p>It was going too fast. Unable to help herself, she attempted to rear up and...couldn\u2019t. She tried to lift her head, but her braid was caught on something. She stared at the mattress, three inches from her nose, and fumbled at the headboard, trying to find what he\u2019d hooked her braid on.</p> <p>His ruthless hands closed on her wrists and secured them one-handed at the hollow of her back.</p><p>\u201cDamn you!\u201d She struggled, totally helpless, her head caught, her hands caught. He shoved his knees between her legs, pushing her legs apart, exposing her. With his free hand, he explored her intimately and hummed in interest. \u201cYou\u2019re puffy, gatita. And very wet.\u201d</p><p>His fingers moved over her clit, so very assured, touching her in the way he knew turned her on. Although she kept fighting, the more she fought, the more her need grew. His chuckle showed he realized exactly what was going on\u2014and his ability to read her so easily increased her arousal as well. Dammit.</p><p>He positioned his cock at her entrance and swirled it in her wetness. His grip on her wrists tightened, warning her. He plunged into her, all the way to the hilt.</p><p>Her body froze in shock, and she gasped as her pussy strained to accommodate the invasion. Yes, yes, yes. Pushing her forehead onto the mattress, she let him take her over.</p><p>He did. He took her, roughly as he\u2019d promised, slamming into her, thick and hard and uncomfortably long.</p> <p>Not satisfied, he released her hands and gripped her hips, angling her for greater penetration until he nudged her womb with every thrust. Yet the roughness and discomfort increased her arousal, pushing her toward climax in a way she\u2019d never felt before. He wasn\u2019t touching her clit, the stimulation only from his rigid erection. Everything inside her started to tighten, her entire lower half a fiery ball of nerves.</p><p>As he yanked her back onto his cock, over and over, her braid pulled at her scalp, reminding her she was restrained. Her hands fisted the covers as the pressure inside her grew. The air thickened until she cried out with each stroke, each demanding thrust wonderful, perfect, keeping her teetering right at the top.</p><p>And then he moved differently, his shaft circling her entrance, making her folds tug on her clit. The fire inside contracted into a whirlpool, blasting a tsunami of sheer sensation over her sea walls, flattening everything in front of it until an ocean of pleasure streamed to every far nerve. The room echoed back her scream, then her gasps for air.</p><p>He somehow hardened, thickened even more. Short, brutal thrusts sent more waves through her, and then he pressed, deep, deep, and the spasms of his cock made her insides clench over and over around him</p><p>His grip on her hips released\u2014she\u2019d have bruises there tomorrow, and she didn\u2019t mind in the least. No\u2014she gloried in the thought of his marks on her. Every nerve in her body was singing, and satisfaction flowed with each beat of her pulse. And happiness. More than from her climax, but caused by the feel of his hands, demanding, controlling, merciless. Dammit, why?</p><p>She\u2019d been dominated before; he gave her...more. Or she surrendered more. Anxiety rippled through her. How much would she surrender to him?</p><p>He ran his hands down her sides in long strokes, reached under to fondle her breasts, and chuckled when her vagina spasmed around him. When he finally pulled out, she moaned at the loss. Without speaking, he flattened her on the bed again to unhook her braid, then rolled her onto her back like a puppy.</p><p>Throat exposed, belly up. At his mercy. Her anxiety increased as she realized annoyance still tightened his jaw.</p> <p>\u201cIs this what they call friends with benefits?\u201d he asked, holding her chin.</p><p>She felt her face heat and closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d he growled.</p><p>Her gaze met his, and she couldn\u2019t escape from the anger in his eyes. She swallowed.</p><p>\u201cIf you wish rough sex or D/s sex, then tell me. I took you hard this time, so we could both discover your response.\u201d His gaze softened, his thumb stroking over her lower lip. \u201cThere\u2019s no question as to how you respond. You think about it and what you want.\u201d</p><p>He swung off the bed and turned, his expression dangerous. \u201cAnd then you will talk to me honestly and openly.\u201d</p><p>Dammit.</p><p>That afternoon, Raoul pushed back from his desk, rubbing his exhausted eyes. If he was going to continue designing at home, he needed a bigger screen.</p><p>On the left, Kimberly worked her way through the stacks of filing he\u2019d accumulated. He hated paperwork. Normally, he\u2019d summon his secretary to do the tedious business. But for now, it kept Kimberly occupied.</p><p>My friend, Kimberly. Smiling slightly, he watched her examine a paper and put it into a folder. Even lacking any power exchange, he liked having her in his house.</p><p>After she\u2019d crawled into his bed last night, he\u2019d discovered he still enjoyed making love to her. Then again, he was a man. Was fucking ever bad? Yes, the normal sex with Kimberly had been pleasant, although lacking any rich flavor or bite, as if someone had made tacos without adding cayenne or cumin.</p><p>She\u2019d also felt the lack. He grinned, remembering how she\u2019d goaded him, trying to make him lose his temper. He hadn\u2019t\u2014barely\u2014although he\u2019d given her the roughness and control that she needed. She\u2019d come like a dream.</p><p>He shook his head. It was amazing she tolerated sex at all after her experiences, let alone with a man dominating her. Would she admit she wanted his control in the bedroom? Could she be that honest with herself\u2014and him?</p><p>For a minute, he simply studied her. Pretty gatita, her black, shiny hair loose over her shoulders, her curvy ass filling her shorts nicely, reminding him of the feel of her soft hips under his hands. His eyes narrowed as he looked more intently.</p><p>Pretty...but not happy. The quiet content she\u2019d shown in the weeks prior to the Shadowlands had eroded away over the past three days. Her body now lacked...grace...as if she were no longer comfortable with herself. Tension simmered under her jerky movements and tensed muscles.</p><p>Yet she wasn\u2019t looking around nervously. He opened and shut a drawer loudly\u2014no jumpiness. Not fear then.</p><p>He rested his elbow on the desk and leaned back in his chair, thinking. Serving her dom and others filled a need in her\u2014whether she admitted it or not\u2014but she was also more comfortable when she had rules. Boundaries. Consistency. Apparently, her erratic father had been loving, then not\u2014stern when sober, nasty when drunk. She\u2019d never known what to expect from minute to minute. Rules probably felt...safe.</p><p>When she\u2019d requested that they be friends, she\u2019d not only lost his domination, but the consistency that came with it.</p><p>She glanced over her shoulder, and his eyes met hers. He held her gaze, looking for\u2014Dios, stop it, Sandoval. He turned away, disgusted with himself. Her need called to his, but she had said no. No meant no.</p><p>However, she wasn\u2019t happy or at peace, and he wasn\u2019t sure how to fix that. Not as friends. Hopefully, she\u2019d discuss the problem with Gabi or Faith, but knowing Kim, she\u2019d probably avoid discussions on dominance and submission.</p><p>He caught a movement out of the corner of his eye.</p><p>She was kneeling at his feet, head down, nape beautifully exposed. Begging for a collar. No, stop dreaming.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to kneel to talk to me, Kimberly,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re friends, are we not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Kind of.\u201d Rather than her hands resting open on her thighs, her fingers were laced and white-knuckled in front of her. \u201cI...I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me, but being friends isn\u2019t working for me.\u201d</p><p>Well, apparently she was learning how to share her emotions. He smiled ruefully, then bent and tilted her chin up. \u201cDo you have a request?\u201d He winced, wanting to punch himself. Even when he told himself not to, he couldn\u2019t speak or touch without dominating someone, especially this little one. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCan we go back to the way we were?\u201d</p><p>He stiffened. \u201cWhat way, gatita? Explain more clearly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want...want to be your submissive again, like before. Until the FBI lets me go home or to Gabi\u2019s.\u201d Her blue eyes were earnest, without any apparent reservations.</p><p>The rising pleasure warred with his sinking feeling of dismay. How much more agonizing would it be to see her leave after she\u2019d been his willing submissive? \u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI... It\u2019s silly, but I can\u2019t settle. It\u2019s like when I know I\u2019m doing what you want, I relax and let you do the worrying. I can concentrate on the one thing you\u2019ve told me to do.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019m just stressed over the past stuff and with not knowing what\u2019s going to happen. But...\u201d She huffed out an unhappy breath. \u201cI liked it better when you were in charge.\u201d</p><p>Kim stared up at Master R. His expression had changed to one of consideration. She loved how he\u2019d take the time to think things through. Damn him. If he wasn\u2019t so very smart or if he made hasty decisions or bad ones, she wouldn\u2019t be here on her knees. But she trusted him to steer a straight path...as much as any human could.</p><p>She dared to lean forward, wrapping her arms around his legs and resting her cheek on his knees. A warm spring of contentment welled up in her heart. He could think as long as he wanted if he\u2019d let her stay here, just like this. When he stroked her hair, she closed her eyes and enjoyed.</p><p>Sure, she still had a niggling worry that he or the slavers had brainwashed her into a weakwilled real slave, but right now she didn\u2019t care. Once this time was over and she went home, she\u2019d get her life straightened out. And until then, well, she\u2019d consider having a master to be a unique kind of pill\u2014a tranquilizer or something.</p><p>\u201cYou need this?\u201d he asked gently.</p> <p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d She kept back the automatic Master because he hadn\u2019t agreed to assume the role again. But inside, she was whimpering, Please, Master, yes, I do. Please.</p><p>Would he agree? He liked being in charge. She bit her lip. Was she asking more than she should? The silence seemed to stretch, reaching to the horizon. Please.</p><p>\u201cAll right then.\u201d He paused. \u201cI agree, sumisita, and I think you\u2019ve overdressed for this house.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and rose. But the anxiety, the worries...didn\u2019t go away even with the relief rushing through her, and she still felt as if a rope was wrapped around her lungs, keeping her from taking a full breath. But, surely everything would settle down. Surely this was what she needed. \u201cYes, Master.\u201d She stripped her clothing off, folded it, and placed it on a chair.</p><p>He leaned back, one elbow on his desk. His fingers rubbed his lips as he studied her. She stood beside him, shifting her weight, and...if anything, feeling worse. What have I done? Maybe this was the wrong decision. She realized her hands were clasped in front of her. Should she\u2014</p><p>\u201cKimberly, stop.\u201d He shoved his chair away from the desk and patted his knees. \u201cCome.\u201d</p> <p>Yes, she needed to be held. That was all. She started to sit on his lap, and he ruthlessly turned her and pulled her stomach-down over his thighs instead.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d She tried to push up. \u201cNo\u2014I haven\u2019t been bad. What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>His left hand pressed on her back, keeping her pinned down despite her struggles. \u201cNo, you haven\u2019t been bad, gatita. This isn\u2019t punishment.\u201d His right hand stroked over her bottom. \u201cThis is about a little submissive\u2019s needs.\u201d He smacked her, barely a sting, then gave her five more before pausing and rubbing her butt again.</p><p>She sucked in a breath as her insides started to shake. \u201cDo you want me to count?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Since this is not punishment, there\u2019s no number, mi cari\u00f1o. I continue until I decide to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>The next set of swats hurt. He hit one cheek, then the other, waiting only for the stinging to die before giving another. She started to struggle again, trying to escape. Her eyes filled as the pain grew.</p><p>A pause, and he stroked over her bottom. Gently, not mean. How could he be loving and cruel at the same time? A gasping sob of frustration escaped her.</p> <p>\u201cBueno,\u201d he said under his breath and started again. Slap-slap, slap-slap, and it hurt. It really hurt. Pain with each hit of his big hand, and then she was kicking and screaming as the wave of pain rolled over her. And continued. And continued.</p><p>When the nightmare didn\u2019t stop, sobbing tore through her. She beat on his legs and kicked, crying hysterically, until finally she went limp, unable to fight any longer, just taking the pain.</p><p>He stopped, oh God, he stopped and was stroking away the hurt, his hand tender on her burning flesh. \u201cVery good, sumisa m\u00eda.\u201d As tears streamed down her face, he helped her to her feet and pulled her onto his lap. Pressing her face against his chest, he held her firmly, engulfing her in security.</p><p>Her pain had changed to mere throbbing, but she couldn\u2019t stop crying. What was wrong with her? Tears and choking and then...her worries dissolved. The noise and tension inside her receded with the tide, leaving only clean emptiness behind.</p><p>She lay still, lulled by his heartbeat, not wanting to move. After a while, she took a long breath. Another. The tight band around her chest had gone, washed away with the storm. She sniffled and lifted her head, felt the chair turning. A tissue was pressed into her hand.</p><p>She wiped her eyes, blew her nose, and with a sigh of regret, pushed to a sitting position to toss the Kleenex in the wastebasket. Her cheeks were probably all purple, her eyes puffy and red. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I couldn\u2019t stop crying.\u201d Feeling humiliated, she dared a look.</p><p>\u201cI know. That was the point.\u201d</p><p>She frowned at him. \u201cYou spanked me so I would cry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed, sumisita.\u201d He kissed the top of her head. \u201cPain can be used for several purposes.\u201d She heard the note that came into his voice when he was instructing. Not like her pompous professors\u2014maybe this stupid person can be taught\u2014Master R had an undertone of gentle humor as if to lure a person into learning. \u201cAs you know from the clubs, pain can be erotic.\u201d He pulled her against his chest, and she snuggled closer with a sigh of content. Just listening to him and being held was sheer heaven.</p><p>\u201cOr used to punish,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut some people bottle up their feelings, their worries, fears, emotional pain. If they are physically hurt enough to make them cry, then sometimes the crying serves for the emotional pain as well. They can release it all.\u201d</p><p>Bottle it up? Me? Well, maybe. She lived enthusiastically, but her inside feelings were her own. Sharing emotional problems was...not her thing. The counseling sessions had been difficult, even with Gabi. She inhaled slowly, savoring the scent of soap and man. Maybe she did suppress things a bit. Her father had wanted perfection, not emotions. \u201cA Moore doesn\u2019t show fear.\u201d \u201cStop that bawling. It didn\u2019t hurt that bad.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s lousy. It looks like a five-year-old did it.\u201d \u201cYou can do better than that.\u201d</p><p>Like her mother, she\u2019d learned to bury her feelings. The counselor had disapproved. Kim snickered.</p><p>\u201cShare that thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFaith told me I bottle stuff up and need to learn to let it out. Maybe I\u2019ll teach her to spank her clients.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cThis is, perhaps, more direct than she\u2019d like.\u201d He sat Kim up so he could frown at her. \u201cI expect you to learn how not to reach this point. And we, you and I, will work on you sharing those emotions before you need to be hurt to get them out.\u201d</p><p>His smile creased his cheek. \u201cWrite about it in your journal\u2014and starting today, you will again fill a daily page to share with me.\u201d</p><p>Hell, back to doing homework. But, okay, so maybe she\u2019d missed their bedtime chats when they\u2019d talk about what she\u2019d written for him to read. Long-term boyfriends, even her fianc\u00e9, had never known her as well as Master R did now.</p><p>\u201cThat reminds me\u2014I want you to start practicing the dances you learned. Show me one before bed tonight.\u201d He nuzzled her hair and murmured, \u201cIf it is adequate, I will take you and please us both. If not, I\u2019ll beat on you first for a while and then take you anyway.\u201d</p><p>She gave a sigh of utter content and leaned back on his chest. \u201cYes, Master.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Black clouds blocked the late-afternoon sun as spatters of rain hit the windshield. Kim grabbed the seat belt as a gust shook the car, and debris swirled across the tiny country road. \u201cI didn\u2019t notice how isolated the Shadowlands was last time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was dark,\u201d Master R said. \u201cAnd you were busy worrying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. Yeah.\u201d Her brows drew together as she stared through the rain at the palmettos and swamp. \u201cHow many members do you lose to alligators?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone, except for the occasional smart-ass subbie who we toss to them for their supper.\u201d He turned between open iron gates, drove up the long, palm-lined drive, and parked in the lot adjacent to a six-foot wooden fence. \u201cLet\u2019s make a run for it, gatita.\u201d</p><p>An umbrella wouldn\u2019t have helped, considering half the rain was traveling sideways. They ran through the gate into a huge landscaped yard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ten or so people congregated under the covered, screened lanai, watching the storm. The FBI agent, Vance Buchanan, and a black-haired man with an olive complexion sat at a table. The rest were in chairs around a long oak coffee table.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Bout time you got here,\u201d came a yell from the giant bartender from the Shadowlands. More greetings followed, a hash of male and female voices.</p><p>When Kim stopped, overwhelmed at being the center of attention, Master R pulled her next to him as if to remind her she had support. After a second, she realized she\u2019d met most of them. By the coffee table was the bartender, Cullen. Next to him were Gabi and Marcus. When Gabi tried to get out of Marcus\u2019s lap, he wrapped his arm around her, keeping her in place. She rolled her eyes and gave Kim a smile of welcome.</p><p>Kari sat beside her husband, looking even more pregnant than before. She grinned and waved, not attempting to get out of the chair. Next to her was Master Z and then the meanestlooking man Kim had ever seen.</p> <p>Master R nodded toward the men at the table. \u201cDo you remember Vance from the FBI?\u201d</p><p>Her stomach tightened at the reminder of why they were meeting today. \u201cUnfortunately, yes.\u201d</p><p>She got a nip on the neck. \u201cUntil you move from under my roof, sumisita m\u00eda, you will observe respect.\u201d</p><p>His submissive. An unsuspected knot in her stomach loosened. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Master. Yes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>The stranger at the table regarded her with eyes even darker than Master R\u2019s. The man\u2019s white button-down shirt didn\u2019t hide his lean musculature, but he was smaller than the other FBI agent who was built like a Viking warrior. Yeah, she could see Vance leaping off a boat, heavy axe in his grip, or\u2014with a name like Buchanan\u2014maybe wearing a kilt and swinging a claymore.</p> <p>The dark-haired man rose and walked over, leaning on a cane. \u201cMs. Moore, I\u2019m Galen Kouros. We talked on the phone a few days ago, but it\u2019s nice to see you in person. Vance and I are in charge of this investigation.\u201d After a glance at Master R, he offered his hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to meet you, Agent Kouros.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Galen.\u201d He kept her hand in his for a minute as he studied her. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how sorry I am that you had to endure what you did, but I\u2019m pleased you\u2019re looking so well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Wow. Actual pleasantries. And everyone wore casual clothing with no collars, no BDSM equipment, no floggers in sight. Being in the normal world seemed unreal.</p><p>Galen gave her fingers a squeeze, smiled at Master R, and limped back to the table. Although polite, he was as intense in person as he\u2019d been on the phone.</p><p>\u201cEveryone here is either FBI or Shadowlands Masters and submissives,\u201d Master R said in her ear. \u201cSince Kari\u2019s husband Dan is a cop, Galen asked him to help with coordinating the raid.\u201d</p> <p>Dan\u2019s gaze moved over her in a lingering look, as if the cold-faced cop was memorizing her. He nodded but stayed beside his wife.</p><p>Master Z said something to the others and then crossed the patio. He glanced at Master R, then held his hand out to her.</p><p>Her fingers were in his before she had a second to think. Damn. Like Master R, the man simply exuded power.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you again, Kimberly.\u201d His gray eyes held hers for a moment, then narrowed, and he gave Master R an unreadable look before smiling slightly. \u201cI can tell you and Raoul are...getting along. You look good together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here!\u201d Jessica trotted down the steps from the third floor, followed by Andrea and a slender redhead. The small blonde started toward Kim, then detoured to thump a tray of sandwich makings on the table by the FBI men.</p><p>Carrying a big bowl of chips, Andrea got snagged by the giant bartender who pointed at the coffee table in front of him. \u201cPut it there, love. If anything\u2019s left when I\u2019m through, the others can help themselves.\u201d</p><p>Andrea did exactly as he said and then pushed Cullen far enough sideways on the love seat to snuggle beside him.</p><p>The redhead added her bowls of dip before deliberately moving the chips to the center.</p> <p>\u201cBeth, those are mine!\u201d</p><p>Grinning at the bartender\u2019s loud complaint, the slender woman knelt beside the meanlooking, scarred-up man. Kim\u2019s heart quailed as she waited for him to reprimand the woman. Instead he tugged Beth\u2019s red hair lightly. A smile lit his darkly tanned face when she kissed his wrist.</p><p>Kim relaxed.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mere, girlfriend.\u201d Jessica pulled her away from Master R to give her a hug. \u201cI wanted to visit you, but the feebies said I couldn\u2019t.\u201d She gave the FBI agents a disgusted look.</p><p>Galen frowned at her, although amusement turned his lips up. \u201cNew little slaves like Kim don\u2019t entertain friends,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Raoul didn\u2019t normally have employees coming to the house, Gabi wouldn\u2019t have been permitted there either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPffft,\u201d Jessica said under her breath.</p><p>Master R grinned and murmured, \u201cYou may talk for a bit, Kimberly.\u201d He kissed the top of her head and joined the others.</p><p>Kim clasped her hands together, annoyed at how her anxiety rose without him beside her. Dependent. You\u2019re getting as dependent as a clown fish needing an anemone to hide in. She hauled in a breath. I\u2019m a strong, independent woman... At least, I\u2019m getting back there.</p><p>She deliberately turned away to talk with Jessica. \u201cHey, I saw you at the club when that dom slapped the brunette. I can\u2019t believe you actually broke into a scene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy bad. I should have called the dungeon monitor, but I was too mad.\u201d Jessica scowled. \u201cSally\u2019s one of the trainees, and when I saw her crying, I lost it. She\u2019s so not into the faceslapping stuff.\u201d</p><p>Kim understood completely. Being hit in the face was a shock. Horrifying in a way. Her stomach tightened as she remembered how Lord Greville had backhanded her. Unable to help herself, she glanced over her shoulder to check that Master R was close. Just the sight of him calmed her nerves. \u201cWhat did Master Z do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Master Calm and Levelheaded. He was mad at the dom, since Sally hadn\u2019t okayed face-slapping, but she hadn\u2019t used her safe word either. She said she was too weirded out, and I believe her. She\u2019ll sure be more careful with setting hard limits on her play next time. Z made the dom apologize, but he couldn\u2019t do much else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...it looked like you bit Master Z. You didn\u2019t, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Red swept into the blonde\u2019s face. \u201cMaybe a nip. It\u2019s not like I made him bleed or anything. I hate being gagged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, Jessica. You need lessons in behavior.\u201d Kim bit the inside of her cheek to keep from laughing and glanced at Master Z. A little older than the others and with the elegant, pulledtogether appearance of someone who was wealthy and accustomed to it. \u201cWhat did he do to you?\u201d</p><p>Jessica lowered her voice. \u201cHe made me strip and put me on my back at the end of the bar.\u201d She sent a fulminating glare across the patio at Z. \u201cThere I am, whining, \u2018We\u2019re engaged. You\u2019re not supposed to want to share me,\u2019 and he laughs and says he\u2019s never minded sharing my beauty or even my punishments. God.\u201d</p><p>At Gabi\u2019s house, Jessica had mentioned Z\u2019s inventive discipline but always with a rueful expression, never like a woman who\u2019d been brutalized. He couldn\u2019t have done anything too cruel. Could he? \u201cGo on, before I burst.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not sounding much like sympathy to me.\u201d Jessica turned her frown on Kim. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to feel sorry for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Right. Lost my place for a moment.\u201d Don\u2019t laugh. Kim wrapped her arm around Jessica\u2019s shoulders. \u201cAwww, you poor, poor baby. What evil things did your mean dom do to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s much better. I knew I liked you.\u201d Jessica grinned. \u201cSo\u2014the bar top has recessed rings here and there. He tied my hair to a couple, so I couldn\u2019t lift my head, blindfolded me, and used knee cuffs to spread me open for everyone to see.\u201d</p><p>Kim couldn\u2019t decide if she was horrified or turned on. She checked on Master R. He was talking to Z...and watching her and Jessica, his eyes filled with laughter. What was Z telling him? She turned back to Jessica. \u201cMmmhmm. Ah, go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has this miniflogger with three soft strands\u2014a pussy whip. He lent it to every dom at the bar and let each one take five lashes at my pink bits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat douche bag,\u201d Kim snapped, her mood changing abruptly.</p><p>\u201cNo, it didn\u2019t hurt.\u201d Jessica pulled Kim farther away from the group. \u201cDammit, that was the problem. Getting lashed like that, off and on, got me hot. Really hot. God, I think it lasted an hour or more. He sat and lectured me on proper submissive behavior and calling dungeon monitors and not barging into scenes, and all the while the doms kept me right on the edge. I swear, he waved them off every time I got close.\u201d</p><p>Putting her hand to her throat, Kim tried to imagine being so exposed. Being excited and having something hitting her pussy. Oh boy.</p><p>\u201cLook at those jerks,\u201d Jessica muttered. \u201cHe\u2019s sharing again, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Kim glanced over her shoulder. Master R was leaning back in his chair, studying her. He had an erection he didn\u2019t bother to hide, and he laughed when Z motioned like...like a whip. Oh Lord, don\u2019t give my master ideas. \u201cUh.\u201d What had she planned to say? Right. \u201cDid one of them finally, um, ever...?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhen I was a heartbeat away from a stroke, Z took over.\u201d Jessica shivered. \u201cHis other little flogger has a different leather. Not nearly so soft, and his aim\u2014\u201d Her color darkened. \u201cI came so hard the entire room probably heard.\u201d</p><p>Even as heat flared through her body, and her clit throbbed in response, Kim choked with trying not to laugh.</p><p>\u201cOh, go ahead, everybody else laughs.\u201d Jessica scowled and giggled as well. But then her lips turned down. \u201cSometimes I wonder what kind of sleaze I am that I get off on something so public.\u201d</p><p>Kim blinked. She knew those self-doubts only too well. That this brightly intelligent and sweet woman also worried was incredibly reassuring. She gripped Jessica\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re no sleaze. Remember, before...this...I played in clubs a lot, and there\u2019s, like, an increased hotness, knowing people are watching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so. Thanks.\u201d She tilted her head. \u201cYou know, at Gabi\u2019s, you\u2019d never have said something like that. You\u2019d have been too busy shivering. I think you\u2019re healing.\u201d</p><p>Kim\u2019s mouth dropped open. She hadn\u2019t paid attention to her progress recently. She still got uncomfortable at times but maybe because Master R kept increasing the stakes. But she was coming along. She\u2019d had sex. Done a public scene. Could talk about stuff. Definitely improved. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Jessica gave her a smug look. \u201cI\u2019m always right. Ask anybody...well, anybody but Z.\u201d She wrinkled her nose at her dom and got a flashing grin that changed his lethal appearance into simply gorgeous. \u201cSo what do you and your lord and master want to drink?\u201d</p><p>Easy answer. \u201cSupposedly Z picked up some ale from someplace\u2014the Swamp Head Brewery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, the 10-10-10. It\u2019s a malty brew. Be right back.\u201d Jessica grinned and headed up the steps to the third floor. The blonde might be fluffy, but her legs were in good shape. Shaking her head, Kim made a beeline for her lord and master.</p><p>He looked up, and his smile, just for her, made her spirits bubble like sea foam. Oh, I\u2019m in trouble. God, she loved him. She walked over and waited, unsure if he wanted her to kneel or pull up a chair or\u2014</p><p>He nodded at a large flat pillow lying between his feet.</p><p>When she knelt in perfect position, he leaned forward to murmur in her ear, \u201cBe comfortable, cari\u00f1o. You need not stay kneeling. Sam called to say he would be here in about ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>As she shifted to an easier sitting posture, his legs closed to rub against her shoulders, holding her in safety between them. She leaned on his thigh with a happy sigh.</p><p>And then, as if he did nothing unusual, he fed her chips and dip, alternating his and hers as they often did at home.</p><p>She whispered a thank-you, received a light kiss on top of her head.</p><p>Gabi\u2019s disbelieving look made Kim avert her gaze, only to see the slim redhead\u2019s dom feeding her little sandwich bites from his hand. The sub looked perfectly content.</p><p>Kim considered the woman. She didn\u2019t appear like a kick-me slave; in fact, she\u2019d deprived the bartender of his chips.</p><p>After Jessica delivered their beers in frosty mugs, Master R handed one to Kim. Before she could drink, he leaned down to whisper in her ear. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, gatita?\u201d</p><p>How could she possibly say?</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>The others were arguing over the benefits of involving the various law enforcement agencies. No one was paying attention to her. \u201cIs the redhead a slave? A housewife?\u201d</p><p>Master R rubbed his cheek, already slightly scratchy, against Kim\u2019s. \u201cBeth isn\u2019t a slave, but she\u2019s definitely a submissive. I think they started in the bedroom, expanded outward, so to speak, and now they\u2019re probably living the lifestyle more often than not. She\u2019s not a housewife. She has a yard maintenance service and does landscape design. She did the grounds here for Z.\u201d</p><p>From her vantage point, Kim saw hints of flowerbeds, towering hedges, and tiny footpaths. The sound of at least one fountain. The place was as gorgeous as its owner. So this Beth owned her own company, had an independent life outside of serving her dom...like Master R\u2019s previous slaves had.</p> <p>He turned her pillow\u2014and her on it\u2014to face him, then leaned his forearms on his thighs, ignoring everyone else to focus on her. \u201cDoes being at my feet in a gathering bother you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d She bit her lip under the disconcerting weight of his regard. He was always aware of her, frequently watched her, but when he wanted an answer, an honest answer, his intensity changed. The pressure on her grew as well, like the difference in playing in the pool or diving down sixty feet. \u201cNo. It doesn\u2019t bother me,\u201d she whispered finally. \u201cIt\u2019s just confusing. I\u2019m not like this. I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>A shadow crossed his face. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I act this way because of my kidnapping? The slavery?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cWe will talk about this more later. But, Kimberly, dominance or submissiveness\u2014or the need to serve\u2014isn\u2019t typically created by circumstances. It\u2019s part of a person\u2019s personality.</p><p>She stiffened. Was he saying she had a slave\u2019s mentality?</p><p>Before Kim managed to phrase the question, Master Sam strode across the yard to the lanai, dressed in well-worn jeans, boots, and a pale blue cotton shirt the color of his eyes. He was older than everyone, with silvery hair and skin tanned to leather. He nodded to the men, smiled at the women, then looked at her.</p><p>\u201cYou two didn\u2019t get a chance to really meet the other night,\u201d Master R said to her as the man walked over. \u201cSam, this is Gabrielle\u2019s friend, Kim. Kimberly, this is Sam.\u201d</p><p>The sadist who\u2019d flogged the sub so mercilessly that she\u2019d screamed. Kim swallowed.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you.\u201d Sam held his hand out, waited until she gave him hers, and squeezed gently. \u201cYou\u2019re a brave girl. Raoul is very proud of you, you know.\u201d</p><p>When her mouth dropped open, he winked at her and took the chair next to them.</p><p>\u201cMy friends,\u201d Master R said, stopping the various conversations. \u201cSince Sam will attend the auction, I plan to tell Dahmer I\u2019ll be out of town this weekend.</p><p>\u201cWe did discuss that as a possibility.\u201d Galen\u2019s fingers made a staccato sound on the tabletop. His black gaze held hers for a moment. \u201cAlthough I like some redundancy in an op in case of oh-shit moments, I\u2019d as soon not put more civilians in harm\u2019s way.\u201d He glanced at Vance, who nodded.</p><p>Galen grinned and tapped the table with his knuckles. \u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>Knowing she wouldn\u2019t be involved, Kim sipped her beer and paid intermittent attention to the talk around her. Various plans were discussed with the police dom, Dan, contributing here and there. Outside the patio, the rain and wind increased, shaking the palms and bushes, sending the bright flowers to lie in soggy heaps in the grass. They hadn\u2019t had their day in the sun. Their time had been cut short, she thought. Like Holly. Her throat tightened, and she concentrated on the conversation again.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you get there sooner?\u201d Sam asked the FBI agents in his sandpaper-rough voice. \u201cDahmer said the vans deliver us buyers early, so we can check the merchandise, do a miniscene, maybe even fu\u2014\u201d He bit off the word.</p><p>\u201cYou going to be able to do this?\u201d Vance asked. \u201cYou look more nauseated than Sandoval did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have some lines I\u2019ve never crossed,\u201d Sam snapped. \u201cSo I\u2019d like your raid to be sooner, not later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d prefer that too.\u201d Galen rubbed his face. \u201cBut after you lead us to the place, we need time to set up roadblocks.\u201d</p><p>Vance added, \u201cA lot of the buyers will leave after their purchase. Arresting them on the road means there\u2019ll be fewer in the auction house\u2014and less chance of the innocent getting hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept buyers will be hurting them while we\u2019re testing the merchandise,\u201d Sam growled.</p><p>Master R\u2019s phone rang. He pulled it off his belt, frowning at the display. \u201cPrivate.\u201d He held up his finger for silence. \u201cSandoval.\u201d He listened, then said, \u201cHold on\u2014my hands are wet. I need to put the cell down.\u201d He flicked the setting to speaker.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait, Raoul.\u201d The Overseer\u2019s voice bit into Kim like fire coral yet made her think of rotting fish.</p><p>Nauseated, she silently set her beer down.</p><p>After positioning the phone on the coffee table, Master leaned down and wrapped his arms around Kim, holding her between his legs in a prison of security.</p><p>Every person on the patio had gone still, barely breathing.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re on for this Saturday,\u201d the Overseer said. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to seeing your scene again. I think the buyers will be very pleased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaturday?\u201d Master R paused. \u201cDios, Dahmer. I\u2019d hoped the auction would be Friday. I\u2019m going to be out of town Saturday and Sunday. I have a consult in Venezuela.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid your absence isn\u2019t acceptable, Raoul. It\u2019s too late to get another demonstration set up.\u201d Dahmer\u2019s voice had sharpened, sending a shudder through Kim. That was what he sounded like when he\u2019d ordered a slave to be whipped. Oh God. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Master R\u2019s arms tightened. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t have a choice. Business must come before pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d More silence. \u201cWell, I do understand how inconvenient it can be to rearrange appointments. Let me sweeten the pot, starting with your friend.\u201d</p><p>Galen\u2019s eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d Master R said.</p><p>\u201cOne of the...shipments...fell through, which means less merchandise available this week. So the last batch of buyers\u2014including Sam\u2014will have to wait for another auction. But since I believe in a favor for a favor... If you do the demonstration, I\u2019ll put your pal back on the list so he can attend. Hell, I\u2019ll even give you both a twenty percent discount on anything you buy.\u201d</p><p>Master R inhaled slowly. After a second, he said, \u201cThat\u2019s tempting, Dahmer. I might manage, but my timing would be extremely tight. After I fly in, I won\u2019t have time to fetch my...pet...from...storage. So if I do rearrange my schedule, I\u2019ll have a different pet with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not. Only previously purchased merchandise can be brought into an auction.\u201d</p><p>Kim put her hands over her mouth. He\u2019d have to take her? Not the FBI agent? A chill ran up her spine.</p><p>Master R started to speak, but Galen made a cutting-the-throat motion.</p><p>\u201cWell, that complicates matters. Give me a second to figure out if I can juggle things,\u201d Master R said. He set the phone to mute.</p><p>A violent tremor shook Kim\u2019s body.</p><p>Galen\u2019s eyes turned to her, but he didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to go,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Master R growled something foul in Spanish. \u201cNo. No, you will not do this. You\u2019ve done enough. No m\u00e1s.\u201d</p><p>If he really loses his temper, will he shift completely to Spanish?</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t she think of anything to say in any language? Needing not to think, Kim stared at the ground. An ant was trying to drag a fragment of chip to its home. The piece was too big, but it tugged and tugged. So stubborn.</p><p>Sam broke the silence. \u201cGalen, I think this would destroy the girl.\u201d His pale eyes were cold as ice, but he gave Kim a small smile. \u201cI\u2019m rather fond of this one, even if she does reduce Raoul to swearing in Spanish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why Dahmer\u2019s so adamant about Sandoval doing this demo,\u201d Vance muttered.</p><p>Galen didn\u2019t speak.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Master R said, although no one had asked anything. \u201cDan, you know how often something goes wrong. I will risk my life. Not Kimberly\u2019s\u2014or her freedom or her well-being. Would you take Kari to such a thing?\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s hand opened, conceding him the point.</p><p>An auction, filled with slavers, filled with women being sold. I\u2019ll never escape, will I? Kim leaned her forehead against Master R\u2019s thigh. Everything in her was struggling, drowning in fear, sinking. Deep in the ocean, colors would fade away until everything turned gray. Turned cold. Like death.</p><p>I can\u2019t. But could she sleep at night, live with herself if her absence meant a woman would get bought by another Lord Greville? She lifted her head; it felt too heavy to support.</p> <p>Master R looked directly across the table. \u201cZ?\u201d</p><p>Z had a low voice, as smooth as Master R\u2019s, but without the spine-tingling accent. \u201cNo, Raoul, I wouldn\u2019t agree.\u201d His arms tightened around Jessica, and his brows drew together. \u201cBut I\u2019ve discovered some foolhardy submissives have steel spines.\u201d</p><p>Raoul remembered too well how Gabi had forced the FBI agents to let her work undercover, trying to catch the slavers. Although Kimberly might be terrified, she was no less brave than her friend. But surely she wouldn\u2019t push to do this.</p><p>Rising onto her knees, she twisted around to face him, her hands on his thighs. Her wide blue eyes could pretzel a man\u2019s heart. \u201cGatita, no.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cSam called me brave. It\u2019s not brave to hide, knowing that if you do, other</p><p>women will suffer. Might die.\u201d Her lips trembled. \u201cLinda will be at the auction. When she\u2019s sold, she might never get free.\u201d Her cold hands tightened on his legs.</p><p>Raoul shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201d When her lips pressed together, he shook her. He didn\u2019t care if every slave in the world died. She wouldn\u2019t\u2014couldn\u2019t do this. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Her arms closed around herself at the loss of his support, and he grunted and pulled her onto his lap. He\u2019d worked all his life to be strong and powerful so he could guard the ones he loved\u2014yet he couldn\u2019t keep this little bit of female safe?</p><p>She buried her face in his neck. \u201cWe must,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Kouros cleared his throat. Raoul would have punched him if he hadn\u2019t seen the pain in the man\u2019s eyes. The agent didn\u2019t want to ask this either, but he would, just like he\u2019d allowed Gabi to go undercover in the Shadowlands.</p><p>Raoul held Kimberly against his chest, wanting only to shelter her. But he remembered what his mother had said when he\u2019d tried to keep his younger sister, Lucia, from going to the mall...starting to date...driving a car. You can\u2019t protect her against her will, Raoul. It\u2019s her life; you don\u2019t own her. He didn\u2019t own Kimberly.</p><p>\u201cGatita m\u00eda, are you sure?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Shivers ran through her soft body.</p><p>\u201cYou still there, Raoul?\u201d Dahmer\u2019s voice came from the phone.</p><p>Kouros looked as if he wanted to kill something. But he nodded.</p><p>Raoul pushed the Mute button. \u201cI\u2019m here. If I move some appointments, I can attend,\u201d Raoul said, unable to manage a friendly tone. \u201cI hope you make it worth the inconvenience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019ll be pleased. You have my word.\u201d Dahmer chuckled. \u201cSo I\u2019ll be in contact sometime on Saturday night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil then.\u201d Raoul snapped the phone shut, barely managing to keep from throwing it across the patio.</p><p>Kimberly was very quiet that evening, pulling away from him as if she couldn\u2019t bear to be close. Yet when she moved away, she\u2019d watch as if afraid she\u2019d lose him. He finally took her to the tower room to see the stars appear in the darkness of the sky.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sumisita. This was not how it should have gone,\u201d he murmured into her hair. Dread had lodged in his bones, yet he wanted nothing more than to sit here with her in his arms. Soft and fragrant and warm, and appallingly brave.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. Sorry I\u2019m being weird.\u201d She rubbed her cheek on his shirt. \u201cI keep remembering how helpless I felt. How trapped. I wish Saturday came faster. Can you keep me busy tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can, yes.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes started to drift shut. \u201cI hope Gabi comes over tomorrow. Some noise would be good. She\u2019s like a one-woman party.\u201d</p><p>A party. As he held his little sumisa, Raoul considered possibilities. At the auction, Kimberly might have to endure another public demonstration. If she felt more comfortable with being exhibited, her concentration might stay on him, not on the slavers.</p><p>A party would be a good idea.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Raoul strolled out to the kitchen, carrying a bunch of beach towels, and spotted Kimberly looking at the filled ice chest, arms crossed over her naked breasts.</p><p>She scowled. \u201cDid you forget to tell me something? Are we going somewhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKimberly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He kept his gaze on her, waiting her out.</p><p>Silence. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Master,\u201d she muttered after far too long.</p><p>\u201cDo you feel in need of being punished then?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>A step back. \u201cNo. No, Master.\u201d</p><p>Did she have any idea why she was coming across with the attitude? His pity for her made him want to ignore it, but she needed consistency and rules more than sympathy right now. Since nothing else in her world remained stable, he must. He moved into her personal space, not touching, letting the size of his body add to the intimidation. \u201cThen perhaps you would explain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d Her fingers tightened on her mug. \u201cI... It\u2019s wrong. Those monsters buy women to be slaves, and here I am, volunteering to be your slave. But I\u2019m not really, and I don\u2019t want to behave like one.\u201d Her chin jerked higher...and then her gaze dropped. \u201cOnly, then sometimes I do.\u201d</p><p>Most of the time, you do, little sumisa. He cupped her cheek, and his thumb under her chin kept her face raised to him. The shiver running through her at his care and his control reinforced her words. She was in conflict, and he knew the feeling well, especially when it came to her. \u201cAny decent human, master or slave, is revolted at kidnapping and brutality and rape.\u201d He rubbed his thumb over her soft lips. \u201cAside from the fact that the slavers\u2019 crimes brought us together and into these roles, they have nothing to do with what is between us.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth opened.</p><p>He shook his head, pleased when she obeyed. \u201cYou are not my slave, Kimberly. Although definitions vary, in my mind, a slave gives up the ability to say no, something like if she\u2019d enlisted in the army. She deliberately places her life under someone else\u2019s authority, often because her need to belong is so profound that she wants to be owned. Are you with me so far?\u201d</p><p>Under his restraining hand, Kimberly nodded. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNow a submissive gives up power, but not as much. Perhaps like a job instead of the military. A submissive wants more than an arranged scene, but that can be erotic domination all the way to serving full-time. Each relationship balances how those needs and wants are worked out.\u201d</p><p>He pressed his thumb between her lips in an imitation of a cock. Her breathing increased as her soft mouth closed around him, holding him within. \u201cYou are submissive, Kimberly. You knew that even before you met Gabi, years ago.\u201d He smiled. \u201cAnd you require more than bedroom domination. Serving a master fills a need in you as great as the need to be dominated to truly enjoy sex.\u201d</p><p>She glared at him.</p><p>\u201cOh, it is true, gatita. You\u2019re not a slave who wants all your choices taken away, but you may very well be a full-time submissive.\u201d He stepped even closer, holding her gaze. \u201cNow use your tongue on my thumb the way you would on my cock.\u201d</p> <p>Redness streaked her cheeks as she ran her tongue over him, butterfly light.</p><p>\u201cSuck.\u201d</p><p>Her pupils dilated as she sucked.</p><p>He hardened. \u201cGood. I\u2019ll give you the real thing later.\u201d</p><p>Her lips were wet, and he could see how they\u2019d look around his shaft.</p> <p>After replacing his thumb with his lips in a slow, drugging kiss, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s a good day to remind you of the pleasures of domination\u2014the fun of it\u2014so we\u2019re joining some people in a bit.\u201d</p><p>Her face paled, and she took a step back.</p><p>\u201cNo, gatita. Nothing to do with the slavers. This is Marcus and Gabi. Andrea and Cullen. Each dom plays with his own sub.\u201d He ran his knuckles over the outside of her bare breast. \u201cAnd I will play with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d The way heat replaced the fear in her eyes pleased him. She trusted him. \u201cDo you want me to prepare anything?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Raoul shook his head. \u201cPut on a suit and cover-up. We\u2019re taking the sailboat out.\u201d</p><p>When her face lit up, he knew he\u2019d chosen wisely. Water always calmed her. As he watched her run upstairs, he smiled at how trepidation had glimmered in her eyes, the knowledge that today would be different.</p> <p>Although they\u2019d had sex frequently, he hadn\u2019t pushed her, knowing the encounter with the Overseer needed to fade. But she\u2019d worked through those fears, and now he could introduce something new. Something to take her mind off the auction and remind her BDSM could be fun as well as terrifying.</p><p>On the thirty-two-foot catamaran, Kim sprawled on the forward trampoline with Gabi and Andrea. The cool spray sprinkled over her skin as the boat slid through the water with a swishing sound and an occasional snap of the sails. Lovely. So different from the motorized boats she\u2019d grown up with. Clean and quiet.</p><p>She could even hear the murmur of the guys\u2019 talking in the cockpit. She smiled, thinking of how they harassed each other in that weird guy fashion.</p><p>Watching Master R interact with his buddies was interesting. Sometimes when around other men, a guy would behave as if his girlfriend was unimportant, as if showing a woman affection would make him less macho.</p><p>But Master R stayed the same in public as in private. And his concern and affection for his friends was clear. Dammit, why did she have to like him so much? I need to go home. Soon.</p><p>Gabi bumped shoulders with her. \u201cYou holding up all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh sure. I just want it over, you know?\u201d</p><p>Andrea tipped her face up, and the sun glinted off her golden brown hair. \u201cI bet.\u201d A big woman with a full figure, her size was perfect for Cullen.</p> <p>Kim smiled at her. \u201cThanks for the support at the Shadowlands the other night. It helped to know people were keeping an eye on things. On me.\u201d</p><p>Andrea nudged her arm in the same way Gabi had. \u201cNo problem. Shadowlands subs watch out for each other. It took me a while to really get that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding.\u201d Gabi sneered amiably at Andrea and then glanced at Kim. \u201cWhen Ms. Callme-independent here actually asked Beth to help her with planting a garden, I thought the entire group would drop dead in shock.\u201d Gabi tilted her head back, letting the breeze rumple her shaggy hair. \u201cI\u2019m glad Raoul invited us today. Marcus prosecuted a really nasty murder case, and it was bothering him. It\u2019s good to get away.\u201d</p><p>Kim smiled, enjoying how normal the day had been. Blue sky with puffy clouds, ocean mist, light conversation. The nightmares seemed to belong to someone else. She glanced up as the sails spilled air, and the boat slowed.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to hang out here for lunch and swimming,\u201d Cullen called.</p><p>\u201cGood plan,\u201d Andrea yelled back. \u201cYou two hungry? What comes first\u2014food or swim?\u201d</p><p>With the boat stopped, the sultry heat increased quickly. \u201cSwim,\u201d Kim decided. She stripped down to her two-piece pink suit and jumped off the back. Bubbles frothed around her, and the cool, silky ocean enfolded her.</p><p>A whoop sounded, and Andrea hit the water, creating a tidal wave.</p><p>Gabi jumped in on Kim\u2019s other side. \u201cThat feels perfect.\u201d</p><p>They played for a while, splashing and gossiping, sharing recipes and dom tales, television shows, and Tampa gossip.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t the guys going to get in the water?\u201d Kim asked finally.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re male. The only thing men are fast at is sex.\u201d Andrea grinned. \u201cWant to try getting them in sooner?\u201d</p><p>Half-listening as Marcus and Cullen discussed an arson case, Raoul sipped his iced tea and thought about Kimberly. He\u2019d enjoyed seeing her relax, talking and laughing with the other two women. Unlike some of the submissives he\u2019d brought on outings, she fit nicely with the others, adding to the pleasure of the day.</p><p>Raoul set his drink down and listened, hoping to hear her infectious giggle again. He heard only the men\u2019s voices, the clanking of the lines and muted flap of sail, and the waves lapping at the boat. No women\u2019s voices. Not even any splashing. He rose to check forward where the women had been sunning. No one. \u201cWhy is there no noise? Where are the women?\u201d</p><p>Cullen paused in his story, then set down his soft drink. He peered over the starboard side and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d Marcus strode to the port side. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>A quiver of worry stabbed at Raoul. The area had no strong currents\u2014and the subs would have shouted if they\u2019d had problems. I should have watched more closely. \u201cI\u2019ll take this side.\u201d Already shirtless, he balanced for a second and dived off.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>Still no noise. No one could be that quiet in the water...unless they wanted to. Ah. He frowned at the boat, at waves too small to conceal a person. Surely they would not be so foolish... He swam forward and rounded the port hull.</p><p>The three women were silently hiding under the trampoline section. Kimberly\u2019s hands were over her mouth to suppress her laughter.</p><p>He flattened his smile and frowned at them. \u201cYou are all in so much trouble.\u201d With a yell, he summoned the other two doms.</p><p>Cullen swam around the side, saw them, and cursed. \u201cSneaky little pet, aren\u2019t you?\u201d He reached out and snagged Andrea.</p><p>She yelped and kicked, her foot connecting with Cullen\u2019s gut. He sucked water, and she got loose, swimming past him.</p><p>As Marcus rounded the hull, Gabi fled.</p><p>Kimberly followed right in her wake, and Raoul chased after.</p><p>His little sub could swim\u2014better than he could, in fact. He finally caught her, partly because she couldn\u2019t stop laughing, and he enjoyed the sound too much to want it to end.</p><p>Kim grinned, feeling the way Master R crowded her as she climbed the ladder. Maybe because she\u2019d knocked him back in the water last time? God, he was so going to kill her. Her sides ached from laughing as she joined the others.</p><p>The flat trampoline area between the catamaran hulls where Kim and the other women had lounged had grown crowded with the addition of pissed-off men.</p><p>Trying to stop giggling, Kim leaned on the railing and watched her master step from the ladder. Oh my God, just look at him. Water ran down the center of his chest between solid muscles that looked as if they\u2019d been carved from cedar. His soaked shorts sagged on his hips, displaying his ridged abdomen. When he folded his arms, she couldn\u2019t look away from the rockhard muscles of his biceps. The other men had great builds, but Master R looked like a god of war.</p><p>And, uh-oh, he looked as angry as one. When his dark eyes focused on her, her laughter died, and her mouth went dry.</p><p>\u201cKimberly. I am displeased.\u201d</p><p>Her throat clogged at the thought that she might have really upset him, and she dropped to her knees on the mesh without thinking. Her head bowed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Master.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>She glanced up through her lashes and saw laughter in his eyes. He wasn\u2019t really mad, drown him. \u201cIt isn\u2019t nice to lie. Master,\u201d she muttered. What had happened to honesty?</p><p>A warm hand cupped her sea-cooled chin, and he lifted her face. \u201cYou\u2019re right, gatita. I shouldn\u2019t make you think I\u2019m angry when I\u2019m not.\u201d His lips curved into a devilish smile. \u201cI\u2019d planned to say you were disobedient and punish you, but that would be wrong.\u201d</p><p>Oh, good. She gave a sigh of relief.</p><p>\u201cHowever, I still plan to punish you...just because I want to. I\u2019m your master, and that\u2019s all the reason I need.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open. \u201cYou\u2019re going to hurt me...for fun?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMost definitely.\u201d He gripped her upper arms and pulled her to her feet.</p><p>Kim looked around, starting to realize what had happened\u2014their little game had transformed easygoing men into doms, and the atmosphere of the simple boat outing had changed.</p><p>Cullen had already dragged Andrea back to the cockpit. She could hear the smack of his huge hand hitting bare flesh, and the sound was distracting. Erotic.</p><p>Marcus had pushed Gabi on her knees. Kim stared at him. This wasn\u2019t the ever so polite Southerner she\u2019d stayed with. His blue eyes were icy as he told Gabi her diversion had caused his beer to get warm, and that was simply unacceptable.</p><p>\u201cYour beer got warm?\u201d Scowling up at her dom, Gabi pushed her hair out of her eyes. \u201cGod, you\u2019re uptight. Did the aliens maybe forget to remove your anal probe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat does it.\u201d He grabbed her hair and pushed her toward the cockpit.</p><p>Kim grinned. The pampered doms wanted a comfortable bench to sit on to punish their subs.</p><p>Still smiling, she looked at Master R. He was studying her with a speculative look in his eyes as if assessing how much she could take. She swallowed. \u201cWhat are you going to do, Master?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrip for me, please.\u201d</p><p>Oh boy. He might be enjoying himself, but his tone said she\u2019d better watch her step. The first tiny flare of arousal sparked to life in her belly. She pulled off the top and stepped out of the skimpy bottom. When he put his hands behind his back, she knew what he wanted and assumed the inspect position he\u2019d taught her. Legs apart, hands behind head, breasts elevated. Cold dribbles of water ran down her back from her tangled hair. The mesh was warm under her bare feet, the breeze cool on her damp body.</p><p>He walked around her slowly, his gaze warmer than the sun against her shoulders. \u201cI prefer your nipples to be more colorful,\u201d he said finally. \u201cThe water turned them blue.\u201d</p><p>What kind of complaint was that?</p><p>He shook his head at her when she tried to say something. \u201cStay in position, sumisita.\u201d He went into the salon and returned with the picnic basket and some cushions, which he tossed around the area. After rummaging in the basket, he pulled out...a packet of wooden skewers? Rubber bands? And a brown lunch sack.</p><p>What the heck?</p><p>He opened the packet, removing two of the skewers. She eyed them with a frown. They looked awfully pointy.</p><p>\u201cYou think they\u2019re sharp?\u201d he asked in a mild tone as he broke them in half, making them a few inches long. He lined up the pointed ends, wrapped his fingers around all four...and pressed them gently on her upper breast. \u201cAre they sharp?\u201d he asked, as if merely curious.</p><p>The sensation, just short of pain, took her breath. \u201cUm. I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He tapped them against her skin, lightly in a circle around her breasts, leaving marks like mouse prints behind. She stiffened at the tiny stinging\u2014arousing\u2014pains. Her nipples couldn\u2019t get any tighter, and her clit poked out as if wanting attention as well.</p><p>Master R worked his way to the edge of her nipple, then ran his free hand between her legs. He slid his fingers easily through her wet folds and caressed her hard nub to urgency.</p><p>Her hips tilted forward as his middle finger penetrated her to the knuckle. Then the second knuckle.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019ll explore pain more today,\u201d he said, his soft voice curling across her nerves. \u201cYou seem to be ready.\u201d</p><p>Pain. Her pussy clenched, and his finger was right there to tell. Dammit. The thought of pain terrified her...and turned her on at the same time.</p><p>And he knew. The little sharp sticks worked in toward her left breast and back out, not quite touching the areola. Teasing her. She could feel her breasts growing heavier, more swollen. Aching.</p> <p>He tapped the sharp, sharp points right on top of her nipple.</p><p>The sudden bite of pain sent carnal electricity ripping from her sensitive peak straight to her clit.</p><p>When she tried to step back, he pushed his finger deeper in her pussy in an intimate anchoring. The sticks moved to her other breast. Oh God, knowing how it felt increased her anticipation. Her left nipple still stung as he circled her right breast.</p><p>Her clit throbbed wildly, and when the points jabbed ever so lightly into her right nipple, she almost came.</p><p>But not quite. Her whole body flamed with need. She whimpered when he pulled back, leaving her empty inside.</p><p>His firm lips curved into a smile. \u201cI love the sounds you make, cari\u00f1o.\u201d He kissed her sweetly, then tugged on one nipple, mercilessly pulling it into a point.</p><p>Sweet kisses. Mean fingers. Her brain spun.</p><p>He placed a skewer horizontally above and below the peak, pinching it between them. Her mouth dropped open as he put rubber bands on each end. Homemade nipple clamps.</p><p>Her nipple flattened as he increased the tension with the rubber bands, and the pain grew. \u201cMmm,\u201d she protested, afraid to yell, \u201cow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBreathe through the pain. One breath. Another.\u201d He held her chin, forcing her to look at him. \u201cTake the pain\u2014for your master.\u201d</p><p>For Master R. She sucked air in through her nose, her teeth gritted.</p><p>\u201cGood gatita.\u201d The tenderness in his voice increased her determination to endure.</p><p>The pain eased into a mild pinching sensation, but one that didn\u2019t stop, keeping her constantly aware of the discomfort.</p><p>He did her other nipple the same way, watching her expectantly as her teeth ground together, before the bite let her catch her breath.</p><p>\u201cSuch a good sumisa.\u201d Taking a step back, he surveyed his work. \u201cVery nice. You may relax now.\u201d</p><p>She put her hands down at her sides, hissing when the movement jostled her breasts.</p><p>\u201cHey, that\u2019s a great look.\u201d Cullen\u2019s rough voice. He and Andrea had returned. His sub was stripped as bare as Kim. Andrea\u2019s eyes went wide when she saw what Master R had done. She glanced warily at Cullen.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cThose big nipples of yours will squash and look great.\u201d As Andrea sputtered something in Spanish, he asked Raoul, \u201cGot any more of them, buddy?\u201d</p><p>Master R set the package and the bag of tiny rubber bands in Kim\u2019s hands. \u201cTake them to Master Cullen,\u201d he said.</p><p>Kim crossed the trampoline and dropped the evil things into his big palm.</p><p>\u201cThanks, pet. Now go on back to Master Raoul.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure I want to. Kim eyed the water. Escape again? No, he\u2019d catch her and probably be truly upset. With a sigh, she returned and knelt in front of Master R.</p><p>The trampoline vibrated as Marcus returned, followed by a dutiful-looking Gabi. He pointed to his feet, and Gabi went to her knees.</p><p>Kim exchanged a rueful glance with her friend, feeling how things had changed. When they\u2019d visited BDSM clubs together, the scenes had been just erotic fun.</p><p>Today was more. Under Master R\u2019s teasing, Kim heard a serious note, the undeniable will of a master. Perhaps this was the difference between a dom who didn\u2019t really know her and one who knew exactly where her limits lay...and intended to push them.</p><p>Feeling herself sway with more than the movement of the boat, she met his contemplative gaze.</p><p>\u201cRaoul.\u201d Marcus was studying Kim\u2019s breasts, laughter in his sharp blue eyes. \u201cMight I ask if you happen to have anything else interesting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019d known the submissives would become so unruly, I\u2019d have brought my toy bag. But there are a few more pervertables in the picnic basket.\u201d</p><p>Marcus patted Gabi\u2019s head. \u201cWell, we just see what I can find, won\u2019t we, sugar?\u201d He stepped around her and lifted the lid.</p><p>Kim bit her lip, trying not to laugh as Gabi\u2019s eyes started to spark. Temper, temper, Gabrielle.</p><p>\u201cCullen, the man\u2019s got rope.\u201d Marcus tossed a handful of precut ropes and a pair of heavy scissors into the middle of the area and dug farther. \u201cAh, here we go.\u201d He straightened, holding rubber bands and two plastic clamps, about three inches long with serrated edges.</p><p>Gabi\u2019s eyes shot fire. \u201cYou are not putting those on me. You dumbass, those are for potato chip bags, not for breasts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHands behind your back.\u201d</p><p>She looked at the set of his jaw, and her hands laced together behind her back.</p><p>\u201cVery nice, sugar.\u201d</p><p>With the first clamp, Gabi yelped, hissing as he wound a rubber band on the handle part to lessen the pressure.</p><p>Kim\u2019s eyes narrowed when she realized the clamps had chunks chipped from the handles so the rubber bands wouldn\u2019t slip. Master R had used them before, hadn\u2019t he? She gave her master a scowl. Tricksy dom.</p><p>Grinning, he bent and whispered, \u201cShe\u2019ll have a tantrum any minute now.\u201d</p><p>Kim smothered a laugh. When staying with the couple, she\u2019d heard some pretty creative insults. Gabi\u2019s voice did carry a ways.</p><p>Marcus put the second clamp on, and Gabi made a sound like a teakettle.</p><p>Smiling, he held her upper arms, keeping her from moving. After minute, he asked, \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>Gabi glared. \u201cIf you want to add some variety to your sex life, why don\u2019t you just use your other hand?\u201d</p><p>Marcus barked a laugh. Pushing her legs apart, he cupped her pussy, then held his glistening palm up to show her. \u201cYou seem to like this kind of variety, darlin\u2019.\u201d He smiled as she turned red and sputtered, obviously searching for an insult potent enough. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kim\u2019s eyes stung with tears.</p><p>Master R turned her face toward him, frowning. \u201cHe won\u2019t hurt her, chiquita. I promise. This is how they like to play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that.\u201d Kim blinked and smiled at him. \u201cI\u2019m so happy for her. I always wanted her to find someone who\u2019d push her to be herself and not some perfect person like her parents wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet gatita.\u201d Master R kissed the top of her head. He glanced at the other couple, snorted at another Gabi insult, then shot Kim a warning look. \u201cJust in case you think to imitate your friend, I do not permit such disrespect.\u201d</p><p>She already knew that. He gave her a lot of leeway, but she\u2019d learned how far she could go with mouthing off. If she\u2019d said what Gabi had, she\u2019d have had her butt blistered, and that certainty actually felt reassuring, like when winds stop veering and blow straight and true. \u201cYes, Master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, you will please me with your soft mouth, and if you do well, your punishment won\u2019t be...too bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s my punishment, Master?\u201d</p><p>The corners of his eyes crinkled, but he didn\u2019t answer, just unzipped his shorts and took out his cock. The piercing glinted in the light. Oh God, she hadn\u2019t done this since...since Lord Greville and... A shudder ran through her.</p><p>\u201cEasy, gatita.\u201d He held his hands out to her, and she put hers in his. He squeezed reassurance, then curled her fingers around his erection. Hotter than the sun with steel under the velvety skin.</p><p>She opened her mouth to take him in\u2014and froze. They\u2019d tied her hands behind her back; that device had held her mouth open. Pushing into her throat, choking, no air.</p><p>\u201cKimberly.\u201d A sharp tug on her hair reminded her of where she was. \u201cWatch me, not the past.\u201d</p><p>She pulled her thoughts together, thought through the fear the way Faith had taught her, knowing he would let her take as long as she needed. After a minute, she nodded. Ready. And reminded herself, This is Master R.</p><p>\u201cUse your hands.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, remembering the first time they\u2019d made love, how he let her go as slow as she wanted as long as she kept advancing. So patient and calm. He might know her well, but she knew him too, and God, it really, really helped.</p><p>He made a noise in the back of his throat, a dom-style sound of encouragement and prodding.</p><p>Stop thinking. \u201cYes, Master.\u201d She slid her hands up and down his cock. It was so engorged that the skin was taut, the veins distended. Men\u2019s equipment never seemed particularly attractive, but Master R was so devastatingly, potently male. She ran a finger around the head, touched the piercing, cupped his heavy balls, and felt the light hair tickle her palm. She nuzzled his groin and inhaled. His own masculine scent mingled with that of the ocean. Her muscles loosened.</p><p>\u201cNow your tongue,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She leaned forward and ran her tongue up his length, getting him wet. He hummed his enjoyment, and warmth filled her. God, she loved that sound he\u2019d make. She licked until his shaft was wet and she\u2019d traced every vein. Then she looked up.</p><p>When he nodded permission, she took him into her mouth, trying to go deep as\u2014</p><p>\u201cNo, tesoro m\u00edo.\u201d He wrapped her hands around the base of his shaft, preventing her from taking him in fully. \u201cIf I wanted to fuck your throat, I\u2019d remove the piercing first, at least until you have more experience. For today, play with what I\u2019ve given you. And be careful\u2014metal is unforgiving on teeth.\u201d</p><p>Oooh. She ran her tongue over her teeth. Avoid the piercing, Kim. He was still worried, she could tell, but actually, she\u2019d daydreamed about having his cock in her mouth. She was ready. Really. She took him in carefully, making sure her teeth went past the piercing...and then played, as he\u2019d instructed. Tracing her tongue around him, then sucking vigorously enough to get a low moan of approval.</p><p>She cupped his testicles with one hand, enjoying the weight and size. Mmm. And he\u2019d probably smack her if she called him Master Bull.</p><p>Lifting her head, she took the top of his erection between her lips and teased the piercing with her tongue. By carefully tugging on the metal ball with her teeth, she won herself a growly groan.</p> <p>His hand fisted in her hair, and she froze; when he didn\u2019t do anything further, she continued. He grew harder, and she gloried in it.</p><p>\u201cAll right, little torturer.\u201d Using her hair, he pulled gently her away. \u201cNow for the punishment I promised you a while back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat one?\u201d</p><p>His evil grin wasn\u2019t reassuring in the least. \u201cAss in the air, please.\u201d</p><p>A spanking? She positioned herself, careful of her breasts, which still burned and ached every time she jostled his strange nipple clamps. After putting her head on her forearms, she arched her bottom up.</p><p>He picked up the sack and removed... Oh, holy hell, the anal plug she\u2019d chosen from the ones she\u2019d hidden. She\u2019d really hoped he\u2019d forgotten. She closed her eyes, wanting to whine. The plug was shaped like a plump, round goldfish...on steroids. Too big. He\u2019d used his fingers in her a time or two and once put in a smaller plug during a shower, but this...</p><p>He trickled lube over it and between her cheeks. The muscles of her vulnerable hole puckered more tightly, and she tried to twist her bottom away.</p><p>A stinging slap made her jump. \u201cYou do not move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGatita.\u201d His voice was so soothing she wanted to crawl into his lap. \u201cI think you will like this once it\u2019s in. Until then, you will take the discomfort for me, will you not?\u201d His hand stroked the place he\u2019d slapped, turning the sting into pleasure.</p><p>Her arousal dampened the insides of her thighs, and she wanted to beg him to just fuck her instead. But his calloused hand on her bottom\u2014so determined, so careful\u2014made her tongue tangle.</p><p>\u201cNow push back against my finger.\u201d He circled the rim with a slick finger, then firmly penetrated her.</p><p>She whined at the stretching feeling. Not painful. Uncomfortable.</p><p>He added another finger, slowly thrusting in and out. \u201cSuch a pretty asshole. Maybe we\u2019ll go to bed early tonight, no? I would enjoy being there.\u201d</p><p>A shudder of nerves and arousal ran through her. He pulled out and pressed the slick anal plug against her. He pushed the tip in and out, farther each time. It was bigger\u2014more than the size of his fingers, stretching and burning. His grip on her hip kept her from moving away again as he eased it slowly inside. Wider and wider.</p><p>She groaned and pushed her forehead against her arms, trying not to remember...them. The pain. She tensed.</p><p>\u201cSsssh. Almost there, chiquita.\u201d And then with a soundless pop, it was in, and her muscles settled into the tail part that was smaller than the rest.</p><p>She stayed in position, panting, feeling his strong hand rubbing her bottom reassuringly. Her memories faded under his touch. Never before had anything back there also aroused her. How could something so uncomfortable make her clit throb demandingly?</p><p>\u201cYou were very good. I\u2019m proud of you,\u201d he murmured, rubbing her back and her bottom, and she realized she\u2019d endure much more to win that note of approval in his voice.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t hide toys anymore, will you, chiquita?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time, I\u2019ll hide only the small ones.\u201d</p><p>A second, and then he laughed, the sexy, delighted sound that always made her grin. He said sternly, \u201cBad gatita. No hiding toys.\u201d The light smack on her ass shoved the plug in farther, zinging against unfamiliar nerves.</p><p>\u201cNo, Master. Never.\u201d She turned her head, eyeing the sack lying on its side. It wasn\u2019t empty. What else had he brought?</p><p>He helped her to her feet, and the nasty thing he\u2019d stuck up her backside felt huge as her cheeks closed around it. She shifted her weight, trying to find a comfortable position.</p><p>Master R grinned. \u201cDon\u2019t worry; you won\u2019t be thinking about it in a bit.\u201d He pointed to a corner of the trampoline. \u201cLie down there, on your back.\u201d</p><p>Each step moved the thing inside her, and the discomfort made her aware of how wet she was and how swollen her pussy had gotten. Her clit begged in heavy throbs to be touched. But touching herself was a spanking offense. Being spanked with an anal plug in? So not my choice of fun ways to spend the afternoon. She carefully lay down where he\u2019d directed.</p><p>He picked up some rope from the pile and tied her wrists together, then over her head to an upright on the railing. A cushion went under her hips so her pelvis arched up in the air. After restraining her legs widely apart, he sat back on his heels, his gaze running over her, head to toes, lingering on her breasts and then her pussy.</p><p>She\u2019d never felt so exposed. So available.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, Kimberly.\u201d</p><p>Uh-huh. She knew full well, she was only passably pretty, but when he said that, looked at her like that, she felt absolutely hot. And totally ready for him to pull his cock out and have at it. Now now now. She squirmed.</p><p>\u201cNo, you will not entice me to move faster.\u201d His eyes were heavy lidded as he trickled his fingers over her mound, then traced her labia down. He gave the anal plug a wiggle that sparked shots of electricity straight to her clit. Her hips pushed up uncontrollably, and a crease appeared in his cheek. \u201cI thought you might like the plug.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His smile grew. \u201cNow you get a new toy as well.\u201d He pulled the hidden thing out of the bag. Soft-looking and the size of a couple of fingers and thumb forming a C curve. \u201cI don\u2019t think you need lube for this.\u201d He pushed one end of the C into her slick pussy and angled the other part over her clit, letting it rest there. Not doing anything, dammit, but with that monster anal plug, even the small part inside her seemed excessively tight. Too much.</p><p>Her heart rate increased as her body shivered with the sensation of being tied down. Penetrated. With a whimper she closed her eyes and tried to relax. Waves splashed on the boat, the sound of a distant motor mingled with the pants of one of the other women and the low growl of a man\u2019s voice. The sun shone down on her, heating her skin to almost the temperature she was inside.</p><p>Pulling on the restraints, she found no give and could feel the last remnants of control slipping away. Helpless. Vulnerable. She opened her eyes and looked up.</p><p>He stood beside her, watching her squirm and fight, his silent regard reinforcing his obvious determination that she be open to him emotionally as well as physically. That she surrender.</p><p>Under the power of his gaze, his authority, she felt her muscles go limp. And she gave up.</p><p>His eyes warmed with approval. \u201cSumisita m\u00eda,\u201d he said softly. Down on one knee, he ran his knuckles tenderly over her cheek.</p><p>She turned her head and kissed his fingers, the action just so...right.</p><p>So was his kiss that followed.</p><p>After a minute, he sat back, and his expression changed. Heat. Anticipation. \u201cI like that position. You look like a pagan sacrifice, all stretched out, just waiting to be served up to a god.\u201d</p><p>Sacrifice didn\u2019t sound good. \u201cMaster R.\u201d She\u2019d attempted a teacher\u2019s stern tone, but her voice sounded more like a nervous first-grader who\u2019d wet her pants. What could he be planning? He didn\u2019t have any whips or floggers aboard, and no toys were left in the sack.</p><p>His expression had a little of the sternness she\u2019d seen when she messed up. He was definitely aroused\u2014his erection still tented the front of his shorts. And his eyes held amusement. That worried her the most.</p><p>She licked her lips, tasting him.</p><p>He straddled her hips, keeping all his weight on his knees. Softly, he ran his fingers down the insides of her arms, over her armpits, which made her jump, and down her ribs. His touch was light, almost too light. Back up.</p><p>Her skin grew more sensitive. He stopped below her armpits, stroking higher, and...it tickled. She tried to shift away, but he had her strung to immobility. He teased his fingers under her arms.</p><p>Giggles broke from her, and she squirmed. \u201cStop it. That tickles!\u201d</p><p>His smile was white against his tanned skin. \u201cCari\u00f1o, I know.\u201d He did it again, making her laugh uncontrollably, not stopping even when she started to curse.</p><p>\u201cDamn you,\u201d she gasped when he sat back. \u201cStop it. I don\u2019t like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said you\u2019d be punished, mi peque\u00f1a sumisa. Did you think I was joking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not this way.\u201d Good God. \u201cI\u2019d rather be spanked.\u201d</p><p>He grinned and said softly, \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>She glared at him. \u201cAre you done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no. I\u2019m still exploring.\u201d</p><p>She moaned.</p> <p>\u201cBut I\u2019m going to mix some sensations together to see how you do.\u201d He reached down to the part of the toy that lay over her clit and clicked something. A buzz started both inside her and over her clit. Too light, too slow to do much, but...distracting. Just enough vibration to frustrate her, as if she were riding a Harley, but not enough to get her off.</p><p>Master R watched, his hand rubbing her arm, letting her need grow. Letting her stew. \u201cTake a breath, chiquita. You\u2019re not quite through being punished\u201d\u2014he grinned\u2014\u201calthough you\u2019re sweating enough, yes?\u201d</p><p>God, sweat trickled between her breasts and down her face. \u201cPlease stop now.\u201d Her hips wiggled uncontrollably.</p><p>\u201cAh, but I like watching you squirm. And laugh. You don\u2019t laugh enough.\u201d He clicked the vibrator through several cycles, settling on an odd erratic rhythm, fast, then slow. Bringing her close to orgasm, then retreating too soon. Driving her up. God, he\u2019s going to kill me.</p><p>He moved between her legs, his knees pressing on the insides of her thighs. As the vibrations increased and she stiffened with the approaching climax, his fingers brushed down the insides of her forearms again to the tender area under her arms, teasing her with feathery touches. She gasped, jerking helplessly. Laughing, then moaning, then laughing as his fingers grazed over the increasingly sensitized skin.</p><p>He eased off, his fingers moving just enough to keep her aware, to keep her whole body tensed as the vibrator ruthlessly brought her back the brink.</p><p>Oh God, I need to come. Her lower half coiled, the feeling strangely intense. With the humming on her G-spot from inside, the flickering over her clit from outside, the entire area of nerves between them tightened. The pressure inside her built higher...higher...</p><p>Everything clenched for a long, impossible second, and she exploded. God, God, God. Even as she bucked under the climax, Master R drew his fingernails lightly over her ribs. She arched as new sensations blasted through her, making her laugh, making her scream, sending the entire world into a blaze of sensation, buffeting her between pleasure and torture and more pleasure.</p><p>She shuddered to a halt finally, slowly realizing he\u2019d stopped tickling and even removed the vibrator. Grinning, he nuzzled her cheek.</p><p>\u201cYou bastard,\u201d she gasped.</p><p>\u201cNo, Mam\u00e1 insists I am born of a marriage,\u201d he protested and claimed a hot, wet kiss, pulling her under his spell again.</p><p>Okay, she hated him, but she loved him, even if he was a sadistic scumbag asshole.</p><p>Sitting back, he ran his hands over her thighs, stroking gently, making her feel cherished and beautiful, even as shudders still ran through her body.</p><p>\u201cYou know, buddy,\u201d Cullen said a minute later. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a tickling session quite so hot. I\u2019m not sure it was much of a punishment, but damn.\u201d He eyed Andrea speculatively.</p><p>She shook her head frantically. \u201cNo. Absolutely no. I hate being tickled. Don\u2019t you even think about it.\u201d</p><p>Master R whispered in Kim\u2019s ear, \u201cThere\u2019s a lesson for you. That is never a smart thing to say to your dom.\u201d</p><p>Kim choked on a laugh. From the half leer on Cullen\u2019s face, he\u2019d just hopped onboard with the tickling idea. He\u2019d already had Andrea\u2019s hands bound in front of her, and now he hefted her to her feet. Turning her toward the ocean, he lashed her hands to the railing, forcing her to bend at the waist, and roped her ankles widely apart to the uprights.</p><p>\u201cNo, Cullen. Please, no, Se\u00f1or.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a vibrator, but we\u2019ll manage, little tiger.\u201d His laugh rang out, and he stepped out of his shorts, completely comfortable being stark naked. \u201cToss me that lube, Raoul.\u201d He caught the lube and drizzled some between his sub\u2019s buttocks and more on his very erect cock.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, you wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Andrea gasped.</p><p>He contemplated the body stretched out before him, then frowned. \u201cI need to heat you up first, right?\u201d His fingers teased from her armpits down to her clit and back up.</p><p>Once he had Andrea cursing and laughing and wiggling uncontrollably, he worked his cock into her anus, a little at first, then pushing all the way in. She groaned and groaned again as he started to thrust. His hand disappeared around her front, and from the way Andrea moaned, he was playing with her clit.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds pretty good, love.\u201d Cullen wrapped his free arm under her stomach, stabilizing them both, and changed from her clit to tickling under her arms. Giggles and groans filled the air.</p><p>God, if they did this in town, Kim thought, the cops would be pounding down the door.</p><p>Andrea was begging and cursing, mostly in Spanish.</p><p>Kim smiled. Here was someone she could ask to translate Master R\u2019s swearwords.</p><p>From the sound of rhythmic thumping on the side of the sailboat, Marcus had taken Gabi back into the water and was enjoying himself. A string of insults was abruptly cut off, and then a minute later, Gabi sputtered. A very calm Southern voice said, \u201cSugar, you\u2019re fixin\u2019 to drown if you keep that up. Now suck.\u201d</p><p>God, these doms. Kim shook her head and looked up. Master R\u2019s expression was tender as he ran his finger over her lips. \u201cYou\u2019re still smiling, mi tesoro,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI like seeing you happy.\u201d He kissed her gently, lingeringly, in a way that had her heart turning over.</p><p>\u201cI think these have been on long enough, so off they come.\u201d He leaned over and snagged the scissors from the deck.</p><p>These?</p><p>When his fingers touched her left breast, she realized. The clamps. Oh no. He snipped through the rubber bands. As the wooden skewers fell away, blood surged back into her left nipple.</p><p>She gritted her teeth together as fire bloomed in her breast, and only a whimper escaped, changing to a high whine when Master R\u2019s tongue stroked over the throbbing peak. The pain grew worse, then turned erotic as he continued to lick circles around the nipple and blow on it.</p><p>Her clit started to throb in response, and then Master R undid the other clamp.</p><p>\u201cOw ow ow, dammit, ow.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He chuckled and licked over the burning, making her shudder, making sensations stream like a marching band straight to her clit. He moved down, nipped her side, licked her belly button, and ran his tongue over her clit.</p><p>Hot and wet, and the shock arched her back. His tongue circled, teased the hood, waking her whole pussy as if he\u2019d hit her with a jolt of electricity.</p><p>Her insides clenched, making her too aware he hadn\u2019t removed the anal plug yet. Maybe she could ask?</p><p>He lifted his head long enough to smile at her. \u201cYou\u2019re being a good girl, Kimberly. I think you deserve a reward.\u201d He licked over her clit, up and down, slowly but deliberately, bringing her right to the edge. Every firm rub made her insides tighten more.</p><p>Totally aroused, and damn him, he made her feel as if she had no control over anything, not even her body. Tied up, couldn\u2019t move, a giant plug in her, she\u2019d already climaxed, and now he was\u2014easily\u2014showing he could bring her off again.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see how tight you are with your favorite toy still in,\u201d Master R said. He sat up and unzipped his shorts. Her eyes widened as he pressed his erection against her entrance and started to inch in.</p><p>Oh no. Too big. Much too big. \u201cWait. No.\u201d</p><p>His piercing hit, stopped him. He moved to a new angle, and the metal went in, a firm pressure sliding along her insides.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t fit, dammit. You\u2019re too big.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Kimberly. The toy you hid is big. I\u2019m just right.\u201d He leaned forward onto his forearms and kissed her, teasing her lips. Holding steady inside her for a minute.</p><p>His broad hand fondled her breasts. Pinches on her abused nipples arched her spine.</p><p>And then he resumed pushing his shaft in, inexorably, like a tanker forging through the ocean. He watched her face, smiling a little when she\u2019d tried to wiggle free. \u201cDoes it really hurt, sumisita?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Under his steady gaze, she amended grumpily, \u201cKind of. No. But it\u2019s not comfortable.\u201d</p><p>The corners of his eyes crinkled, and he whispered, \u201cI didn\u2019t think it would be.\u201d And he kept going until he was finally, completely in. His balls touched her ass. God, she was so full it was impossible to breathe. Stretched, aching, throbbing.</p><p>She closed her eyes and shivered. He was on top of her, inside her, and the feeling of being taken\u2014being helpless\u2014was frightening, and yet not, because he was watching her so closely that she felt the heat of his gaze.</p><p>\u201cLook at me, gatita.\u201d His voice had roughened.</p><p>Her eyes opened and were trapped by his. Intense.</p><p>Then he pulled back, and every inch of movement somehow transmuted into exquisite pleasure. She gasped as her insides tried to clench and spasmed over the fullness. His eyes on her, he slid slowly back in, then out, totally in control. In and out, rocking slowly as she adjusted to the feeling.</p><p>\u201cBueno,\u201d he murmured, and his strokes changed as he drove into her in short thrusts, only partly in. With the anal plug, his piercing rubbed even more firmly over that sensitive place inside her. Stroke after stroke.</p><p>The pressure in her lower half grew into a shivery, desperate fullness. \u201cI need to stop. I need the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I think this is something else, mi tesoro.\u201d He reached down, slickening his fingers, and stroking over her clit, without ever losing the determined thrusting.</p><p>Too much. The anal plug sent odd zinging sensations through her. His ruthless finger rubbed on her from outside, his pierced cock from inside as if they\u2019d trapped her sensitive clit between them, mercilessly pushing her until everything inside her gathered, whirling her senses like a massive hurricane.</p><p>No pause. No teasing now. Faster, faster, and then everything spun completely out of control. She broke, shattering, her entire body having the orgasm as she screamed and bucked and shattered some more. She felt wetness everywhere, and Master R chuckled and pounded into her deep and hard, and she just kept coming, unable to stop.</p> <p>Finally he tensed into rigidity, pressing in until she could feel the distinctive jerking of his shaft against her cervix as he gave a low rumble of pleasure.</p><p>His weight pressed her against the mesh as he lay on her, radiating such satisfaction that it made tears prickle in her eyes. Then, with a groan, he reached up to work at the ropes around her wrists.</p><p>She swallowed, tried to speak, and nothing came out. Swallowed again. \u201cYou\u2019re evil.\u201d Her voice was hoarse from laughter, from screams.</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed.\u201d He kissed her ear, then nipped her shoulder and laughed when her vagina clenched around him.</p><p>Her arms came free, her wrists still tied together, so she encircled his neck and leaned up to kiss him.</p><p>He kissed her back, taking her mouth to please himself until she felt like melted wax on the floor. As if she hadn\u2019t before. God.</p><p>Eventually, he sighed and pulled out of her, making her aware how wet she was. After he\u2019d released her legs, he helped her sit up, then steadied her as her head spun.</p><p>She realized she was drenched, way past normal, and a flush heated her face. Talk about a wet spot. At least it was mesh under her. Still... \u201cI...I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Darn it, she\u2019d said she needed the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cAh, Kimberly, it\u2019s not urine, chiquita.\u201d He cupped her cheek, forcing her to look at him. \u201cYou did what is called squirting, although that\u2019s an entirely inadequate word for something so very erotic. So hot. You women climax in many different ways\u2014this is just one of them.\u201d He kissed her teasingly, his eyes lit with laughter. \u201cDid you enjoy it?\u201d</p><p>She leaned her head against him. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if I\u2019d survive it, but...yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I will strive to give you more of them.\u201d</p><p>As he rose, she frowned. \u201cUm, Master? Without the tickling next time?\u201d Yeah, maybe it made her whole body more sensitive and gave her a great climax, but still... Please God, let\u2019s skip the tickling stuff.</p><p>He touched the tip of her nose. \u201cThat, mi peque\u00f1a sumisa, will depend on how obedient you are, no?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>The time had come.</p><p>Kimberly stared at her reflection in the bedroom mirror and ran a finger over her new collar. Master R had obviously ordered this one especially for her. It was very soft on the inside.</p><p>On the outside, the black leather boasted a silver engraving: Master Raoul\u2019s gatita. He hadn\u2019t added a padlock, saying she\u2019d feel better if she knew she could remove the collar, and the engraving would make it clear she was owned. She touched the leather. Reassuring.</p><p>I\u2019m Master R\u2019s cat. I\u2019ve got claws, and I know how to use them. Look out, you bastards.</p><p>As for the rest of her outfit... Ugh. A leather micromini for the bottom, so short that if she bent over, they\u2019d see her tonsils. The top was even worse since the decorative leather harness left her breasts totally exposed.</p><p>She\u2019d applied makeup with a heavy hand, hoping to disguise the fear in her eyes. Fear of the auction, of the Overseer, of the slavers.</p><p>Not Master R. After yesterday on the boat, she felt closer to him than ever before. He was her security, a lifeboat in a horizon-to-horizon ocean.</p><p>He came up behind her in the floor-length mirror, wearing skintight leather pants and a matching black vest. His face was set, his eyes remote. He\u2019d looked like that on the night he\u2019d bought her, but not here...never in his bedroom before.</p><p>His gaze took her in, and his whole demeanor softened. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, gatita. The outfit should keep their attention nicely.\u201d He laid a cape over her shoulders. \u201cThey called and are only a few minutes away. We need to go down to the street now. Remember your part?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Master.\u201d Oh God.</p><p>The black, windowless van pulled in front of the house where Raoul waited, his arm around his brave submissive. She suffered an occasional shiver but was holding up better than he\u2019d thought.</p><p>A Harvest Association hireling hopped out, slid open the side door, and let the built-in steps down. \u201cIf you would, sir.\u201d He gestured to the door.</p><p>Raoul climbed the shaky steps and glanced at Kimberly in blatant irritation. \u201cCome, girl. Stop lollygagging.\u201d</p><p>She wore the fetish shoes, tall with spike heels, and as she hurried forward, she stumbled and fell to her knees. With a loud impatient sigh, Raoul put his arm on the top of the van for balance and motioned to the attendant. \u201cHelp the clumsy bitch.\u201d</p><p>As the man assisted Kimberly to her feet, Raoul crushed the vial he\u2019d concealed in his hand and smeared the exposed swab in long streaks across the roof of the van. To his satisfaction, nothing showed. Kouros had said only special glasses could see paint glowing. Since the slavers used GPS jammers in their homes and vehicles, the FBI\u2019s tracking devices had been useless. But now, hopefully, a helicopter could follow them. When picked up, Sam would perform the same swabbing maneuver.</p><p>Raoul covertly flicked the empty applicator high in the air to land in the bushes and with an annoyed sound, helped Kimberly up the last step. In the van, three unaccompanied men occupied the luxury seating near the door, watching small DVD displays. Two turned avid gazes toward Kimberly, and Raoul wrapped her cape more firmly around her.</p><p>She took a breath and stood straight. Brave gatita.</p><p>\u201cMay I have your personal items, please, sir?\u201d the attendant said, waiting on the steps. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Raoul handed over his wallet and phone and keys to be sealed away, then suffered a pat down. The multitool in his boot was checked for sharp points and replaced when he mentioned he\u2019d be doing a demonstration.</p><p>The light flashed toward Kimberly. She opened her covering, and everyone could see she wasn\u2019t hiding a thing.</p><p>As the man jumped out and closed the door, Raoul chose a seat in the back, far from the others. He pulled Kimberly onto his lap, snaked his hand under her cape and over her breast.</p><p>Her startled gaze met his, and he kissed her lightly, murmuring into her ear, \u201cIf I play with you, I have a reason to hold you on my lap, but if you would prefer to kneel at my feet, you may.\u201d</p><p>Her head gave a little shake. At home, she\u2019d have given him a laughing look and shown her pleasure at being in his arms. Not here.</p><p>\u201cStay beside me at all times, Kimberly. We\u2019ll use the leash again, but even so, I want you close enough to feel you. Is that clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Master.\u201d</p><p>He cupped her face in his hand, ran his thumb over her lips. \u201cI am very proud of you, cari\u00f1o,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She burrowed into his arms in a very unslavelike manner, and he couldn\u2019t find it in his heart to deny her the comfort.</p><p>An unknowable time later, they emerged from the dark van and walked up the sidewalk to a mansion blazing with lights. Raoul strained his ears, thought he heard a faint whisper of helicopter blades, and hoped it wasn\u2019t his imagination.</p><p>As they approached the door where the guards were matching photos to arriving buyers, Raoul attached his leash to her collar. \u201cStay beside me now, Kimberly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Master,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThank you.\u201d In the glare of the outside lights, her face appeared gray.</p><p>He lifted her chin and forced her to meet his gaze. \u201cYou are mine, Kimberly. No one will touch you.\u201d</p><p>Under his fingers, the muscles of her jaw loosened. She gave him a jerky nod.</p><p>He ran his finger around the edge, touching her soft neck. \u201cI like seeing my collar on you,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Her smile of agreement was followed by confusion. He understood. She didn\u2019t want to be a slave\u2014anyone\u2019s slave.</p><p>He stroked her hair once, then strolled arrogantly to the door. She remained to his right and half a pace behind. Closer than normal, but he needed her close for his own peace of mind as well as hers.</p><p>The two bulky guards at the door scanned a list of photos and stopped at one. \u201cMaster R?\u201d</p><p>Raoul nodded.</p><p>The guard triggered a house intercom. \u201cTell the Overseer Master R has arrived.\u201d</p><p>A slave hurried over to take Raoul\u2019s coat and Kimberly\u2019s cape as Dahmer strode up.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to the auction, Raoul.\u201d When the man turned his gaze on Kimberly, Raoul had to force his muscles to stay relaxed. \u201cVery nice. I like the harness. You\u2019ll probably receive requests for her company tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t share.\u201d Raoul buried his hand in Kimberly\u2019s hair, using the rough move to pull her closer to his side. \u201cMy mother thought I was quite selfish.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course.\u201d The Overseer gave him a thin smile. \u201cWhile your area is being prepared, can I show you the merchandise? We have some lovely showpieces this time. I daresay you\u2019ll find one or two you\u2019d enjoy far more than this damaged one.\u201d</p><p>What the hell does that mean? Raoul tugged on Kimberly\u2019s leash and followed Dahmer, thinking of how a bridge would oscillate prior to collapse. Something in Dahmer\u2019s behavior was giving Raoul the same sense of impending disaster. His grip tightened on the leash.</p><p>The marble-floored foyer held a wide staircase that looked straight out of Gone with the Wind. Rather than ascending, Dahmer led them into an antebellum ballroom on the right. Textured wallpaper in red and gold warmed the room, and ornate crystal chandeliers attempted to convey a feeling of romance. But there was nothing romantic about the sound of sobbing and screams drowning out the classical music from hidden speakers.</p><p>Raoul stopped, too angry to move. This was a slave market, no matter the attempt to render it high class. Small caf\u00e9 tables and chairs filled the center of the room. The slaves to be sold lined the walls. A heavy cable ran the perimeter, and each slave wore an ankle cuff and a chain securing her to the cable. Raoul nodded in understanding. According to Buchanan, the slavers changed locations with every auction, and a rental agency would take a dim view of someone putting heavy bolts in the walls to serve as restraints.</p><p>Buyers wandered the side aisles between the slaves and the tables, marking the notepads they\u2019d been given. A small pedestal in front of each girl held a large number\u2014the sale item\u2014as well as her biographical and physical information for the buyers to peruse. When Raoul heard the smack of a hand against flesh, he didn\u2019t turn. He was far too close to using his fists on the man beside him. \u201cThis is very impressive, Dahmer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. I have things to do, so go ahead and walk around. Pick out a couple of slaves you like and remember their numbers. You\u2019ll understand why in a bit.\u201d</p><p>The hair on the back of Raoul\u2019s neck lifted. Yes, something was definitely going on.</p><p>As Dahmer headed out of the ballroom, Raoul glanced at Kimberly. Fast respirations. Hands clenched. He wanted to sweep her up in his arms, hotwire a van, and get her the hell out of this nightmare. Instead he squeezed her shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re doing very well, gatita. I\u2019m proud of the bravery you\u2019re showing.\u201d</p><p>A glimmer of tears showed for a second. Then she lifted her chin and gave him a firm nod. \u201cThank you, Master. Your words mean a lot to this slave.\u201d</p><p>This slave? She\u2019d referred to herself in third person, undoubtedly trying to be even more obviously a slave for the evening. She\u2019d gone one step too far.</p><p>Kim saw the way anger lit Master R\u2019s face, eroding the control in it.</p><p>\u201cI realize you meant that for the best, but do not ever refer to yourself in third person. You are not an object. Try it again.\u201d</p><p>She took an involuntary step back at the violence in his voice, yet...the anger was on her behalf. The reassurance that he was the total opposite of the leering buyers dimmed her fears. \u201cYes, Sir. That\u2019s good to hear, Master.\u201d</p><p>His lips curved, making her heart swell.</p><p>Pleasing him felt...right. Too right. Flattening her mouth into a line, she turned and stared at the chained women. He wants me to be like that. Only he didn\u2019t. He treated her as someone he cherished, someone he found sexy, but not a nothing. He was more aware of her feelings than she was\u2014and had been pushing her to recover.</p><p>But he wanted to take the decisions away from her, make them for her. I\u2019m so confused.</p><p>The leash tugged. He\u2019d taken a step and waited for her to pay attention. His eyes were gentle, as if he knew her struggles.</p><p>Get out of your head, Kim. Time to do the job. She followed him obediently, eyes on the ground at first and then not. Instead she looked at the women, memorizing their faces. If the operation failed, at least their families would know where to start looking. She met their eyes, willing strength into them. Hang on. The nightmare might be over soon. Let Galen and Vance show up like they\u2019d planned. Oh God, please.</p><p>A shrill scream lifted over the rest of the noise, and Kim turned. A woman restrained to a cross. A red mark marred her white back. The buyer swung a short whip. A cracking sound. A terrified, pain-ridden scream. Another bloody stripe.</p><p>Kim tried to look away and couldn\u2019t.</p><p>An attendant in a red uniform hurried over to the buyer. \u201cYou must not mark the merchandise, please, sir,\u201d he scolded with the utmost of deference.</p><p>The buyer, an obese man, red-faced from the effort of using a whip, laughed. \u201cI\u2019m done. She\u2019ll do great for what I have in mind.\u201d He checked the number on the metal pedestal. \u201cSlave number eighteen.\u201d</p><p>Kim could hear the woman whimper. Farther away, another whip cracked. Sobbing. Men\u2019s voices thick with lust. A shriek of terror. Heat swept over her, then a clammy cold. Even as her breathing increased, she couldn\u2019t seem to get enough air.</p><p>\u201cKimberly?\u201d Master R\u2019s voice sounded over the roaring in her ears.</p><p>She opened her fingers, all ten for a panic attack, knowing it wouldn\u2019t matter. He couldn\u2019t show her\u2014</p><p>He wrapped her in his arms, surrounding her with his strength, his clean scent. His dark voice murmured in her ears, blocking the other sounds. Anchoring her.</p><p>On her first trip to a beach, she\u2019d toddled into the water. A wave knocked her sprawling, and as she tried to stand, another hit, and another. Her world turned to churning sand and water and choking\u2014and then her mother carried her up the beach to safety.</p><p>As Master R had done over and over.</p><p>She sagged against him, the tight band across her chest easing, her lungs able to draw air again. \u201cOkay,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problema.\u201d He kissed her hair, not releasing her. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to paw you a little so it looks better to the cabrones, s\u00ed?\u201d</p><p>Oh, his temper was definitely up, the way he\u2019d slid into Spanish.</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed, Se\u00f1or,\u201d she whispered back, getting a huffed laugh in return.</p><p>His powerful hands closed on her bottom under her tiny skirt. He gripped her bare cheeks, traced the crack, holding her firmly against him. Oh God, she loved his touch, and it didn\u2019t matter where or when. An arm around her, he tipped her back so he could tease her breasts. Her knees wobbled, and his arm tightened. He yanked her hair, pulling her head back, and kissed her, deliberately rough, biting her lips. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When he released her, she knew her mouth was swollen and red, and her breasts and butt carried red hand marks. His lips curved. \u201cYou look nicely used now, mi peque\u00f1a sumisa.\u201d</p><p>She flashed him a nasty look that made him laugh, and then lowered her head properly. He tugged on the leash, and they moved down the room. She returned to watching the slaves. A blonde with terrified blue eyes, surely too young to be here. Two cringing brunettes, one already bearing whip marks. One woman unable to stop crying was next to an older woman, standing straight and defiant, who\u2014</p><p>\u201cLinda.\u201d Kim halted, jerking the leash from Master R\u2019s hands.</p><p>\u201cBad girl!\u201d He pointed to the floor.</p><p>But... Her training took over, and she sank to her knees. Knowing she\u2019d screwed up royally, she bent completely, arms above her head, wrists crossed, forehead on the floor. The surrender position.</p><p>He left her for long minutes.</p><p>A guard appeared, asking if there was a problem. Master R admitted she was still being trained, but he\u2019d needed her for the demonstration the Overseer had asked for him to do. The guard\u2019s voice acquired more deference, and he lingered to exchange gossip and admire her harness.</p><p>The polished wood floor was cool against her forehead, and she wished she could stay in the position for the remainder of the evening. I don\u2019t know how much more I can stand.</p><p>When the attendant finally walked away, Master R snapped his fingers, and Kim rose to her feet, keeping her gaze on the floor, knowing if she saw Linda\u2019s face, she\u2019d give herself away.</p><p>\u201cI recognized her, gatita,\u201d Master R said in a low voice. \u201cIf we see Sam, we\u2019ll ask him to keep an eye on her if he\u2019s able.\u201d His concern for both her and Linda was clear.</p><p>God, she loved him. When he tugged on her leash, her heart as well as her body followed.</p><p>They passed a woman in hysterics. When the attendant slapped her and she started to sob, Kim\u2019s hands fisted. God, get me out of here. Get us all out of here. And home to our mommies and husbands and friends.</p><p>\u201cRaoul.\u201d Sam\u2019s rough voice. \u201cHell of a place, isn\u2019t it? I already got my eye on three of the beauties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lucky guy,\u201d Master R said casually. \u201cMaybe after I train this one, I\u2019ll come back and buy another.\u201d He dropped his voice. \u201cOne of Kimberly\u2019s fellow slaves is here. We\u2019d appreciate it if you could...keep an eye on her. Especially when things get interesting.\u201d</p><p>Kim dared to look up through her eyelashes to see his reaction. Would he agree?</p><p>\u201cYeah, I like them spirited too.\u201d Sam laughed loudly and pointed to a nearby slave. \u201cThat one got a good beating for her attitude. Makes me think I\u2019d better test the goods before I plunk down my cash.\u201d</p><p>Master R grinned. \u201cYou try out enough merchandise, and you\u2019ll crawl out of here.\u201d He pointed down toward Linda. \u201cThere\u2019s an older one on that aisle who might give you a challenge.\u201d His voice dropped. \u201cNumber ten. Redhead. Linda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d Sam glanced at Kim, and his light blue eyes were the color of ice on a lake. \u201cI like the harness, girl.\u201d He walked down the aisle, pausing for a moment as an attendant offered a buyer a selection of canes.</p><p>When Sam stopped in front of Linda\u2019s spot, hands in his pockets, obviously checking her out, Kim let out a breath of relief.</p><p>Well, how was he to be about this business? Sam wondered, studying Kimberly\u2019s friend. Number ten was an older woman, probably midforties, but one of those who only got lusher\u2014 erotically softer\u2014as she aged. Her chin-length red hair had been curled back in a smart style, showing some silvering in front of her ears. Freckles up her forearms, lightly tanned legs, the rest of her body a pure white that made the sadist in his soul salivate. She was like a blank canvas for a painter. Think of the marks he could put on her.</p><p>Her rich brown eyes had a few wrinkles fanning out from the edges. Would those deepen as she forced herself to take the pain? Was she truly a masochist as her information said?</p><p>As with all the slaves, she was naked, her wrists cuffed together in front, one leg shackled to a heavy cable running along the wall. She gave him a calm stare that made his cock sit up and take notice. He could see her terror. Despite the way she\u2019d laced her fingers together, her hands still trembled. She\u2019d start to pant, her gaze would dart around, and then she\u2019d catch herself. Slow her breathing, lower her eyes. So lovely in her control.</p><p>Using pain, he could take her deep, make her give up that control\u2014and then he could care for her. His sadistic and dominant sides both yelled for him to move forward.</p> <p>Now he knew how Raoul had felt when he\u2019d bought his slave. How he must have wanted to explain he wasn\u2019t like the others, didn\u2019t want any of this nonconsensual bullshit.</p><p>But a man had to play the cards he\u2019d been dealt. He stepped forward. \u201cGirl.\u201d</p><p>Her head stayed bowed. \u201cYes, Sir?\u201d Her voice was that of a woman, low and resonant. No shrill screaming would come from this one.</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her gaze, and he looked into her brown eyes. Soft. She probably didn\u2019t have anything hard about her, not her body, her eyes, her voice. The thought of burying himself in all that softness... His dick had hardened enough to count the teeth on his jeans zipper.</p><p>\u201cAre you a masochist?\u201d he asked, more to determine her honesty than to get the facts. The sign posted on the pedestal gave her specifics, including her experience and preferences. Not that any slaver would care, except to design something to rip her to pieces more quickly.</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir,\u201d she said quietly and dropped her gaze, a slight flush on her cheeks. Didn\u2019t like admitting to that need?</p><p>\u201cKeep your eyes on mine, girl.\u201d He moved forward, close enough to smell the light scent of soap from her body, to see tiny golden specks in her brown pupils. Her heavy breasts brushed against his shirt.</p><p>He\u2019d positioned himself directly in front of her so he could speak freely, and she could react without being observed. Not that he\u2019d reveal anything past the bounds of good judgment. But this would be easier if she didn\u2019t think of him as a total enemy. \u201cYour friend, Kim, suggested I visit you.\u201d He nodded toward the front of the room.</p><p>Her eyes followed his.</p><p>Kim, Raoul, and the Overseer stood by the stage where the women would be auctioned off. The auctioneer was already tapping the microphone, and two attendants bracketed the first slave. A sign to the right announced SLAVE # 30.</p><p>Selling women. Sam\u2019s gut felt as if he\u2019d swallowed a field of thistles.</p><p>While Raoul was talking to the Overseer bastard, Kim caught Linda\u2019s gaze and then nodded slightly at Sam.</p><p>Damndest referral he\u2019d ever gotten. But the redhead released a slow breath. Her muscles relaxed slightly. Better.</p><p>He figured the Feds might take another hour before they got their crap set up. At number ten, this woman would be among the last to be auctioned off. Unfortunately, buyers could abuse her that entire time...unless Sam monopolized her. How many minutes could he waste?</p><p>Would she want him to? \u201cI can play with you until\u201d\u2014the Feds arrive, but I can\u2019t say that\u2014\u201cuntil you\u2019re sold, or you can take your chances with the other buyers. It\u2019s up to you, girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll hurt me,\u201d she stated.</p><p>Keeping his eyes on hers, he nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right. That\u2019s what I do.\u201d He paused a second. \u201cIt\u2019s what you need\u2014although this isn\u2019t the place. But I won\u2019t hurt you past your limits.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth twisted slightly. \u201cAnd you would know those how?\u201d She winced and lowered her head. \u201cForgive me, please, Master.\u201d</p><p>He barked a laugh that had her eyes jerking up to his. \u201cI like plain speech. Honesty.\u201d He pinched her chin roughly enough to keep her attention focused on him completely and saw\u2014 felt\u2014the smallest of easing in her muscles. Yes, she was a masochist and submissive as well. His favorite combination. If she responded to pain and domination sexually, well, hell, she\u2019d be perfect.</p><p>Use your brains, Davies. You\u2019re in the middle of a bunch of slaves. This one would knife you and spit in the hole given half the chance. \u201cI know this because I can read you, little girl. Right down to your toenails.\u201d He leaned forward, still holding her chin, keeping her mouth available for his use, and he took her lips with no teasing, just sheer domination.</p><p>Forcing her response and feeling her response before pulling back.</p><p>Without Kim\u2019s okay and if he hadn\u2019t given her the choice of being with him, he knew this self-possessed woman wouldn\u2019t respond to him at all. But she did.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t scar you. I won\u2019t go past what you can take. If you can trust me that far, this will be much easier for you.\u201d He met her eyes straight on, letting her read his body, hear the truth, and see it in his face. \u201cBut, Linda, I\u2019m going to hurt you. You\u2019ll hate me when I make you take it, and you\u2019ll hate even more that you need it. That it fills that hole inside you and cleans away the clutter.\u201d</p><p>The shudder ran through her, telling him she\u2019d heard him on all levels. Her muscles were still tight, her eyes blazing, yet he could almost smell the subtle perfume of submission.</p><p>She yielded. Now he would give her what she wanted and finish that surrender. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Raoul was grateful when Dahmer finally showed up in the ballroom. Following the Overseer, he steered Kimberly toward the doors. She didn\u2019t need to see any more. Bidding had started on the third woman whose screaming and fighting caught the buyers\u2019 attention like bloody flesh attracting sharks. As he walked into the quiet foyer, Raoul gave a silent sigh of relief. The crying slaves had kept him tensed with the need to protect.</p><p>\u201cBefore you set up for your scene, I need you for a moment upstairs.\u201d The look in Dahmer\u2019s eyes was still...off.</p><p>Raoul tightened his hand on Kimberly\u2019s leash, pulling her closer. \u201cIs there a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Well, yes, in a way there is.\u201d Dahmer led them up the wide stairs, the dark red carpeting like a waterfall of blood. He opened a door directly across from the staircase and motioned them inside.</p><p>Raoul glanced around at the richly furnished sitting room. To the right was a small table and chairs on an Oriental rug. Against the far wall was a hand-carved buffet with a serving tray and the remains of a meal. Oddly enough, the corner held a portable dog kennel. On the left...ahhah. A lean man waited in an armchair by the window, the lamplight glinting off styled light brown hair. Two men\u2014bodyguard types\u2014stood behind him. He would be the reason for Dahmer\u2019s detour.</p><p>As Kimberly stepped into the room, she gasped and gave a thin moan.</p><p>Raoul spun, grasping her shoulders. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord Greville,\u201d she whispered, her eyes going glassy with panic, her breathing like a steam engine.</p><p>Raoul slapped her sharply across the face, rocking her back on her heels. Fisting her hair, he pulled her head back so the only person she could see was him. \u201cYou are mine. You do not react to any other master,\u201d he told her through gritted teeth...and saw reason return to her eyes.</p><p>She blinked tears of pain away, and he let her lower her head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter,\u201d he grunted. He glanced at Dahmer, letting his irritation show. \u201cWhat\u2019s this about\u2014aside from trying to destroy the work I\u2019ve put into this slave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI apologize for not explaining earlier, but I wanted you to view the undamaged beauties downstairs first.\u201d Dahmer\u2019s gaze lingered on the scar visible beneath Kimberly\u2019s harness. \u201cWhich ones did you find interesting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a slave, thank you.\u201d This wasn\u2019t going well at all. Kimberly\u2019s former owner had given Raoul a dismissing look, then hadn\u2019t taken his eyes off her. From the hand-tailored suit, the Italian shoes, the sheer pampered posture, Greville wasn\u2019t used to being denied anything. And he wanted Kimberly.</p><p>The hatred burning in his blue eyes sent cold streaming up Raoul\u2019s spine. He saw murder in that gaze.</p><p>Raoul took a firm grip of Kimberly\u2019s arm and whispered in her ear, \u201cHe seems a little angry. Some people are poor sports about being poked with a knife, no?\u201d</p><p>Her shocked laugh lightened his spirit. Brave, brave Kimberly. \u201cDios, I love you,\u201d he said under his breath, not realizing he\u2019d spoken until he saw her face. The dawning glow outweighed her fear.</p><p>When she looked down hastily, he squeezed her arm lightly. She needed to hold up awhile longer. Somehow.</p><p>And he had to keep her away from Greville. The FBI would arrive eventually, but if her previous owner got his hands on her, she might not survive that long. Stall. Stall and stall.</p><p>Dahmer took a seat on the couch and motioned to the chair across from Greville. \u201cPlease sit. I\u2019m sure we can reach a meeting of the minds. Raoul, this is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreville, I assume.\u201d Raoul assessed the bodyguards with a glance. One had puckered scars across his face and neck. The other had a shaved head with a death\u2019s head skull tattoo on one side of his neck, a swastika on the other. They wore white shirts, dark slacks. No weapons visible. They\u2019d probably received the same pat down as the buyers\u2014so weaponless\u2014but from their stances, they were well trained.</p><p>Not good odds. He was no Chuck Norris. Stall. He took the chair, caught Kimberly\u2019s gaze, and glanced at the floor beside him.</p><p>She knelt at his feet and kept her eyes lowered.</p> <p>\u201cHello, fuckhole.\u201d Greville spoke directly to her, trying to get her to meet his gaze.</p><p>\u201cYou do not address my slave without permission,\u201d Raoul snapped.</p><p>Greville\u2019s face reddened with rage.</p><p>\u201cRaoul.\u201d Dahmer held up a hand.</p><p>\u201cThis is not the professional standards I was led to expect from the Harvest Association. What kind of shoddy scam are you running here?\u201d</p><p>Dahmer drew himself up. \u201cNot a scam. Lord Greville simply wishes to repurchase his slave. During his...illness, his staff returned the slave for a refund. He wasn\u2019t aware and had no intention of returning her to us.\u201d</p><p>Raoul forced himself to lean back in his chair. \u201cPerhaps he should keep closer track of his staff. They sound incompetent.\u201d This is not going to end well. If he got Kimberly out of the room, could she hide until the FBI arrived?</p><p>The attendants were too damned efficient, Sam thought. In answer to his request, one had quickly wheeled a mobile St. Andrew\u2019s cross into Linda\u2019s slave space. So much for his attempt at stalling.</p><p>After turning the woman to face the X shape, he secured her wrist cuffs to the upper rings. The other blank-faced attendant handed him a cane and dragon\u2019s tongue whip.</p><p>He set them down, out of his working area, and considered how to go about wasting time until the FBI arrived. Unfortunately, anything he did would have to be genuine. The assistant had positioned the cross so bystanders could see the marks he\u2019d put on the slave\u2019s back.</p><p>Well, then. He had a masochist who preferred him to the others, he had equipment, and he obviously had time. Apparently he had a scene to do.</p><p>His concentration narrowed.</p><p>He stepped behind the woman and ran his fingers over the pretty spattering of freckles on her shoulders. \u201cLinda,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cAre you ready to begin?\u201d</p><p>Under the freckles, her muscles tensed. She nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhen I ask you a question, I want to hear your voice, girl,\u201d he said in an even tone, setting up the rules of the game. His hands curved around her wrists, adding to her sensation of restraint as he pressed his groin into her from behind, then let his whole body meld with hers, pushing her ribs against the wood in the middle. \u201cYou can call me Master if you need to beg.\u201d</p><p>He threaded his fingers into her short hair, tugging her head to one side so he could close his teeth on the curve between her neck and shoulder. He bit down firmly, enough to hurt. Waking her to her helplessness and his intent. The beast inside him moved forward; his body felt larger, stronger.</p><p>\u201cIf you yell, \u2018Mercy, Master,\u2019 I will...perhaps...give you a break,\u201d he growled, sickened and aroused at the same time. He never worked without a safe word, without consent, but to save her from worse, he\u2019d have to do so\u2014or at least appear to do so. \u201cSay it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMercy, Master,\u201d she whispered. Even her lips looked soft, slightly puffy. Kissable and damn fuckable.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he grunted. He rubbed his hands over her arms and shoulders and down her back, pleased with the gentle hollow at the base of her spine. A big-arsed woman, his British friends would say. His favorite kind. He slapped that white ass, one cheek, then the other. Not hard, just enough to warm the skin, stroking the sting away before striking again. He hadn\u2019t bothered with trying to fasten her ankles to the legs of the cross, not with one shackled, but he set one boot between her feet and shoved them roughly apart.</p><p>\u201cI want you open to me,\u201d he said in a raw voice and was hell of pleased to see a flush rise into her face. His eyes narrowed, meeting hers, and she flinched and dropped her gaze. Submissive. God, she was a beauty.</p><p>Pushing the noise of the auction from his mind, he filled his thoughts with only this woman. He slid his hands over her ample curves, over her rounded stomach to her God-bethanked breasts. Heavy in his cupped palms, spilling over the sides. Fucking her would be like burying himself in a down quilt, surrounded by feminine softness.</p><p>He pressed his chest against her back, delightfully surprised when she didn\u2019t cringe away. When he rubbed his erection on her reddened ass, he heard the smallest moan\u2014and hell with it, he needed to know. He put his hand on her pussy, unsurprised to find she\u2019d begun to dampen. \u201cYou\u2019re wet, girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a slut.\u201d The self-loathing and misery in her voice pissed him off considerably. Raoul had mentioned something about this.</p><p>He growled in her ear and pressed his cock between her buttocks. \u201cFeel that, missy? A man\u2019s dick rises with the smell of a female, with the sound of a woman\u2019s voice, with the dawn, at the sight of pretty tits, at the touch of...anything. No one calls us names because our cocks aren\u2019t under our control.\u201d He cupped his hand over her\u2014nicely\u2014bare cunt, playing in the dampness. \u201cSo when a woman\u2019s pussy reacts on its own, why would I call her a name?\u201d He sucked on her earlobe, surprising a shudder out of her, then ran his scratchy cheek over hers, giving the so-sensitive nerves there a hint of pain. And her juices responded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been doing this a long time, girl,\u201d he said, using her own arousal to slicken her vulnerable clit. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not only good at it, but we\u2014you and me\u2014we have something between us.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYes, missy.\u201d When she tried to pull her legs together, he kicked them open again and felt her tightening nipple press into his palm. The beast inside him said, Hurt this one and make her mine.</p><p>Dammit, not mine. I\u2019m here to stall. Dragging his brains up from where they\u2019d lodged in his balls, he diverted himself with a quick check of the restraints. Hands were pink, cuffs not too tight. Then to please himself, he cupped both of her breasts again, hearing her inhale, feeling her heat against his body.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to make you hurt now, girl,\u201d he whispered. Her breasts were heavy in his hands, and he tightened his grip until he heard her breath catch. \u201cI\u2019m going to whip you until you dance the dance, until your screaming wakes God himself.\u201d He pulled her nipples, pinching cruelly.</p><p>Tears stood in her eyes\u2014and her ass pushed back against his shaft. \u201cNo, please.\u201d Her head whipped back and forth as she moved her body, trying to evade his grip.</p><p>He wanted to see her face. A shame he couldn\u2019t walk around the cross and simply look at her; he preferred a chain station for that reason. But this was what he had. He grabbed her chin and turned her face toward him. Her eyes held the pain he\u2019d given her, showing some fear\u2014and more heat. Just right.</p><p>\u201cEyes on me,\u201d he snapped. \u201cAnd don\u2019t look away.\u201d He took one nipple, rolling it between his fingers. Damn, he wished the slavers provided breast clamps as well as impact toys. He squeezed harder, enjoying the whine in her throat. Pulled and pinched, studying her eyes to judge the right amount, and savored the blossoming of fresh pain in her eyes, her face, the way her body stiffened, muscles tensing here and there.</p><p>Sweat started to bead on her upper lip.</p><p>He smiled at her. \u201cThat\u2019s a good girl. Let\u2019s do the other side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaster, please. My breasts are sensitive.\u201d</p><p>He paused, knowing even now that she wouldn\u2019t safe-word out, that this was the beginning of the dance, and he answered the need under her words. \u201cI know they are, Linda. That\u2019s why I\u2019m doing this.\u201d And he squeezed her other nipple.</p><p>\u201cEeeeee.\u201d Her scream caught between her teeth as she shut it down. Her arms jerked with her efforts to escape. To push him away. Her knees sagged.</p><p>He stroked her damp face. \u201cThose screams in there aren\u2019t going to be buried very long,\u201d he whispered into her ear. Her hair was silky, and he rubbed his cheek over it. \u201cIf we were somewhere else, afterward I\u2019d fuck you hard...and pull on your nipples every time you came.\u201d</p><p>The tremor ran from her breasts all the way to her fingers, and he smiled.</p><p>Stepping back, he ran his fingers down her ass, between her legs, to the dampness on her inner thighs. He teased the folds between her legs, nice fat labia\u2014perfectly designed for clamps. His finger slid into her, earning a low moan and wiggle. Very wet. She\u2019d be a joy to fuck. He played with her clit and cunt, the scent and little noises she gave upping his own desire.</p><p>She\u2019d take more pain and last longer if he could keep her arousal high. Fucking slavers\u2014 he damn well didn\u2019t want to be here.</p><p>He wiped her juices off on her leg and felt her flinch, remembered her word. Slut. He gripped her hair, pulled her head back. \u201cI like you wet, Linda,\u201d he growled. \u201cAnd what I want is all you have to worry about right now. Clear?\u201d</p><p>The way she moistened her lips to speak... The way her response flowed to him was getting to him. Hell. He took advantage of how he\u2019d made her arch, and shoved his hand between her legs again\u2014forcefully this time\u2014pushing into her in a manner that showed exactly what he wanted to do to her.</p><p>A tremor ran through her as she clenched around him. More moisture wet his fingers.</p><p>She liked rough. Hell, maybe he\u2019d add a little pussy pain while he was at it. Drive her high before endorphins shoved her head into the clouds.</p><p>He barely glanced at the two buyers who stood nearby as he strolled to his spot. Even turned away from her, he could almost feel her breathing. Feel how the ache in her breasts receded, but the memory lingered. Feel how she craved more.</p><p>After a second, he picked up the cane. Time to warm her up. A slow, slow warm-up. Damn them for not having his favorite toys available. But a light application would work well enough.</p><p>He started by sliding the rattan over her legs, letting her enjoy the smoothness of it, the hardness, before running it up her front.</p> <p>She stiffened.</p><p>That\u2019s right, girl. This is a cane. But pain wouldn\u2019t come from it. It was just for warm-up to the whip.</p><p>Tapping lightly, occasionally giving her a feather-stroke touch, he woke up the flesh on her back, butt, and thighs. He followed the path of the cane with his free hand as her muscles gradually lost their tension.</p><p>Her breathing slowed.</p><p>He increased the intensity, keeping to the sting rather than the blow. Her body was still relaxed, and from the tiny curve of her lips, he knew the small smacking sounds of the cane pleased them both.</p><p>Her ass was turning a pretty pinkish red, a color that made a dom want to use his hand to see if he could darken it. Light play just didn\u2019t do it for him. He glanced at his watch. How long could he drag this out? He saw an attendant talking to a buyer and frowning in his direction. Not long.</p><p>He tossed the cane off to one side and picked up the whip. A dragon\u2019s tail\u2014not his favorite but a good choice in tight quarters. About three feet of rolled leather opening into a swordlike shape and ending in the distinctive point. At least the leather on this was thin enough to give a whippy sensation. After rolling his shoulders, loosening his arm, he snapped the tail a few times, getting the feel, gauging his accuracy, smiling each time she flinched at the light crack. Hell of a lot lighter than a flogger\u2014he could do this all day.</p><p>Then he let the end strike, enjoying the slapping sound, up and down her back, her ass, her upper thighs, finishing the warm-up in the medium range of pain. He moved into a good rhythm, watching her start to fog over. Her breathing deepened as he slowed his strikes.</p><p>He stopped and stepped forward quickly so the loss of the whip was balanced by his hand on her shoulder, the pressure of his body against her back. Rubbing his chest and groin on her reddened skin should give her a rush of pain from everywhere, different from the individual slaps of a whip. Her gasp felt as if it gripped his balls.</p><p>After checking her restraints and circulation, he turned her head, looked into her eyes. \u201cYou still with me here, Linda?\u201d</p><p>She blinked and actually smiled at him. \u201cThat\u2019s my name. You used my name.\u201d</p><p>This one could tear a man\u2019s heart right out of his chest. \u201cThat\u2019s who you are. Linda.\u201d He kissed her cheek and brought her back to the scene by taking her lips, taking her from lightness to hard and demanding. Her body melted into his, then revved with arousal when he cupped her breasts and teased her puckered nipples into jutting points\u2014velvet softness, the bigger size said she\u2019d nursed her babies. He wanted his mouth on them.</p><p>Instead, he ran his hand down to her pussy, beautifully wet and puffy. Her instinctive pulling away from the intimacy rubbed her soft ass right on his cock, forcing her forward again and onto his fingers. A nice predicament for a little sub.</p><p>But he solved it for her, removing her choices by leaning forward, trapping her even as he penetrated her with a finger. Hot, wet sheath.</p><p>He felt how her arousal, her need, vied with her wish to move away from him, to keep herself hidden from him. She made a sound he couldn\u2019t interpret, then whispered, \u201cNo. Don\u2019t.\u201d Her words were negated by the low moan she gave.</p><p>\u201cAre you asking for mercy, girl?\u201d he whispered, pinching her clit lightly and sliding back in.</p><p>Panting, she hesitated. \u201cYes.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we continue. You ready for some real pain now?\u201d</p><p>Her cunt clenched around his fingers, and he grinned.</p><p>After picking up the dragon whip, he did a set, up and down her body, bringing her pain level back to where she\u2019d been before. Then he held the tip of the tail in his free hand and snapped it at her ass like a rolled towel. The end hit. Her skin jumped a split second before her jerk. A sob came from her, and he smiled.</p><p>\u201cNot the same sensation, is it, missy?\u201d Snap, snap, snap. \u201cFeel a little like a whip?\u201d Snap, snap, snap. Her first tear splattered onto the floor, then more. The dragon\u2019s tail flicked its way down the backs of her thighs in pretty red streaks, the narrow leather giving barely satisfying cracks.</p><p>And up her legs, her ass, her back. Her first gasping scream.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good girl. Give me more.\u201d After easing up for a moment, not too long, he worked her into pain, into screams that satisfied his soul and squeezed his cock. By the time she tipped into a truly deep subspace, she\u2019d stopped holding anything from him.</p><p>Her husky scream resonated in his balls.</p><p>He continued a little longer, watching closely now. A safe word wasn\u2019t worth shit if a sub\u2019s brain wasn\u2019t awake enough to use it. He lightened up, finishing what they\u2019d both wanted. Needed. Then even slower, gentling the strikes. Bringing her down.</p><p>Sweat made her skin gleam as if covered in oil. Her head sagged against her upraised arm although her legs still held most of her weight. Yes, she was no stranger to bondage and pain. He set the whip down and moved forward, feeling like a predator stalking his prey but also a man wanting to please a woman. Sadistic. Dominant. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He ran his hands over her, pleased with his handiwork, even more pleased with her gasp as his thick calluses scraped her abused skin. Her ass pushed back as if begging. He straightened and turned her head. Still mostly in subspace. Aroused and needy.</p><p>Damned if he\u2019d fuck her here, treat her like that, but he could at least ease her, give her relief. And if he walked around with a boner for a while, it wouldn\u2019t be the first or last time. He bit her neck, reminding her of his presence, emotionally ground-tying her so she didn\u2019t detach entirely.</p><p>\u201cYou gave me your pain.\u201d His voice came out raspy. \u201cNow give me your pleasure.\u201d His rough fondling of her breasts brought forth a moan, and when he reached down to her swollen, wet pussy, she was right with him. Her body showed her need; her eyes showed her submission.</p><p>Surrounding her with his body, reading the tightening of her muscles, hearing the faint noises in her throat, he stroked over her engorged clit, working her up and up. Was there anything more satisfying than moans after screams? He kept her on the edge, savoring the quivers of her inner thighs around his big wrist, then stroked firmly.</p><p>When she came\u2014her hips bucking, her pussy creaming over his hand\u2014her wailing moan ran down his spine.</p><p>He leaned against her curvy back and her lush ass, pressing her into the cross as he nuzzled her neck, adding sweetness to the ending.</p><p>Don\u2019t look at the cage in the corner. Don\u2019t look at Lord Greville . Kim stared at her knees, controlling her breathing. Controlling the panic was like piloting a boat in a tropical storm, trying to keep the bow headed into the seas. The counselor\u2019s suggestion of imagining Greville with a rabbit-sized dick, whiskers, and a fuzzy tail didn\u2019t help at all.</p><p>The men talked. Lord Greville had a voice like his whip, cutting and ripping, leaving bloody flesh behind.</p><p>The Overseer\u2019s voice was an oil film on water, suffocating all life beneath. Her chest tightened.</p><p>When Master R spoke, the sound washed her clean, let her breathe. His knee pressed against her shoulder, bumping her now and then as if to keep her in the present. Her shoulders straightened. Pay attention. He\u2019ll need your help.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d said that buying damaged merchandise might have been a mistake, so this is your opportunity to find a slave more suited to your needs,\u201d the Overseer said, still trying to arbitrate.</p><p>\u201cI see. I did complain about the damage, didn\u2019t I?\u201d Master R sounded so reasonable, they probably didn\u2019t hear the tight thread of anger underlying his words. \u201cYou\u2019re offering to buy me a different slave?\u201d She felt the vibration as his fingers tapped on her leash. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind owning one with a curvier figure. Big breasts appeal to me.\u201d</p><p>What? After a moment of fear\u2014then a sense of insult\u2014she understood he was stalling for time. He could do no less, although all she wanted was out of here. The sickly sweet scent of Lord Greville\u2019s cologne filled the air, and she breathed through her mouth, trying not to gag. The sounds of screaming came faintly past the closed door. The auction was going on.</p><p>\u201cWell then, we should be able to work something out.\u201d The Overseer sounded relieved.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps. Unfortunately, the slaves here are masochists\u2014not anything I\u2019m interested in. What other auctions do you have coming up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014Well, the next will be in October. The black-and-white affair, featuring blondes and brunettes, with a sampling of black women as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI definitely like blondes. That might work out quite well.\u201d Master R rose. \u201cIn October then. And Greville there will buy whatever slave I wish in return for the girl.\u201d</p><p>The leash tightened; Kim started to rise.</p><p>\u201cUnacceptable. I\u2019ll take possession of her now.\u201d Lord Greville\u2019s voice was flat.</p><p>\u201cLeave me without a slave? I think not. October.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll buy her outright then. How much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill leaves me without a slave.\u201d Master R pulled, and Kim rose to her feet, staying a step behind him.</p><p>\u201cThe hell with this. Just take her.\u201d Lord Greville motioned to his men.</p> <p>Master R dropped the leash and shoved her toward the door. \u201cRun!\u201d</p><p>She scrambled away, expecting him behind her\u2014only he wasn\u2019t. He\u2019d charged the bodyguards. She hesitated and\u2014</p><p>The Overseer slammed into her, knocking her into the wall. He grabbed her hair and yanked her back against his body.</p><p>No! She jammed her elbow into his gut.</p><p>He folded over but still clung to her hair.</p><p>Screaming, she ignored his grip, curling her fingers into claws.</p><p>Two against one. Dios . A big fist grazed Raoul\u2019s face, leaving a burn in its wake. He spun and kicked the other guard in the gut, knocking him on his ass. Spin back, block another fist, try for a knee. Missed. The guards were both damn good fighters. Scarface\u2019s return punch nailed him in the jaw, stunning him.</p><p>Raoul shook his head and half-blindly punched back, feeling the impact and crunch as his fist hit a nose. A bellow. Hot spray of blood. He twisted to check the other.</p><p>And then something punched him from behind, high on the right shoulder. He jerked around to see the Greville bastard jump away.</p><p>The skinhead swung. When Raoul blocked with his right arm, pain sheeted into him like all of hell had opened. He grunted and continued, but his block held no power, and the man knocked him into the wall. As he hit, fire ripped through his shoulder. His knees gave, dropping him to the floor.</p><p>\u201cYou knifed him good, Lord Greville.\u201d Scarface stepped sideways as Raoul pushed to his feet.</p><p>Greville. He\u2019d attacked from behind like a feral cur.</p><p>The two guards had him bracketed, his back to the wall. He could feel the knife, still stuck in his shoulder. Pain shot through him with every movement.</p><p>As the two glanced at each other, trying to synchronize their attack, Raoul darted a look across the room. Dammit, Kimberly hadn\u2019t run, and Dahmer had grabbed her.</p><p>Still looking, he faked a grin, and Skinhead fell for it, glancing over his shoulder at Kimberly. Raoul stabbed rigid fingers straight into the bastard\u2019s throat and felt the cartilage break.</p><p>Scarface yelled and lunged. Raoul tried to block, but his right arm failed\u2014fucking knife\u2014 and a roundhouse knocked him sideways. He staggered, fell onto his hands and knees.</p><p>\u201cUse the knife and just kill him, you incompetent turd,\u201d Greville said coldly. \u201cI\u2019ve got better things to do.\u201d</p><p>When two more men ran into the room, Raoul knew his\u2014and Kimberly\u2019s\u2014chances of survival had just died. Run, gatita, dammit, run.</p><p>Scarface jumped forward and ripped the knife from Raoul\u2019s shoulder. Pain burst like fireworks. Before the guard could step back, Raoul slammed his fist straight up into his balls.</p><p>With a choking gasp, Scarface fell to his knees, grabbing his groin. The knife clattered to the floor. A fucking steak knife from the dinner tray.</p><p>Raoul tried to snatch it and got kicked in the ribs. New guards. His hand skidded on the blood on the floor.</p><p>Heart battering at the inside of her ribs, Kim stared across the room at the group of men. Lord Greville\u2019s bodyguards were down, one on his knees moaning. Between two new men, Master R pushed partway up and dived at Greville, hitting him in the stomach, knocking him down.</p><p>Swearing, the new men grabbed his arms, tearing him off Greville, holding him between them.</p><p>Face dark with rage, Greville staggered to his feet. Using a handkerchief, he wiped blood from his mouth, looked at it. He bent and picked the knife up. \u201cHold him good\u2014I\u2019m going to gut him like a trout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNooo!\u201d Her shriek stopped everything.</p><p>Lord Greville turned, taking his time, Kim could tell. Playing her. He glanced at the Overseer who lay a few feet away, moaning, hands over his face. \u201cWorthless bastard.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t look, wouldn\u2019t look at the Overseer or her bloody fingers. Could only think of Master R. He\u2019d die because of her, because he\u2019d tried to save her. My fault. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t kill him. Please!\u201d</p><p>Lord Greville tilted his head. \u201cYou care for him?\u201d A cruel smile twisted his lips. \u201cOh, I like that. Yes.\u201d He pointed his knife at her, then the cage in the corner. \u201cIn.\u201d</p><p>A cage. Her breath stopped. Darkness, no light at all, the scent of a basement, excrement, urine, blood. Wire under her fingers, around her, she couldn\u2019t stand, couldn\u2019t straighten her legs. An ocean pressed on her chest, flattening her lungs. Air gone. No... She felt a breeze from the open doorway behind her\u2014she could run. Run.</p><p>She edged toward the opening.</p><p>Master R was fighting madly, drawing everyone\u2019s attention. His gaze caught hers, and he jerked his head toward the door. An order matching the one that every nerve in her body was screaming. Run.</p><p>\u201cHold him, dammit.\u201d Lord Greville sliced at Master R with the knife\u2014the blade scraped over the leather vest on the left, then cut viciously over his right ribs. A huge, long gash.</p><p>He made no sound, but Kim saw him jerk. A trickle of red spilled over the edge of the gaping flesh; then blood flowed.</p><p>Sobs choked her; tears blinded her. He\u2019d die; he was dying. \u201cNo, no please, oh God, no. Please.\u201d</p><p>Lord Greville glanced over his shoulder. \u201cThe cage or I cut him into little pieces in front of you. Crawl, fuckhole.\u201d</p><p>She did, her hands numb, her heart hammering too violently. None of it mattered. The cage surrounded her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lord Greville laughed, jagged and cold like a saw blade. He turned back to Master R and scowled at how the two men had to hold him up. \u201cHell, he\u2019s out cold. That\u2019s no fun.\u201d He glanced at the water pitcher, hesitated, then motioned toward the cage. \u201cToss him in.\u201d</p><p>As the guards dragged Master R over, Greville\u2019s eyes met Kim\u2019s. \u201cIf he\u2019s still breathing when we get home, you can show me just how far you\u2019ll go to keep him alive.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d do anything, and her stomach tried to empty as she thought of the perversions Greville would demand.</p><p>The guards heaved Master R into the cage. She pressed against the wire, feeling the wire sides closing in on her. Just as small as the one in Lord Greville\u2019s basement.</p> <p>\u201cGet that collar off her,\u201d Lord Greville said.</p><p>One man grabbed her hair, yanking her far enough forward to unbuckle the collar with one hand. The feel of air against her bare neck was horrible\u2014not like being stripped, but like seeing her house burn to the ground.</p><p>The guard stepped back; the other closed the door and snapped the heavy padlock, removing the key.</p><p>\u201cLook, fuckhole.\u201d Lord Greville waggled her collar and threw it out the door.</p><p>Kim stared after it, her life tumbling down the stairs with it. Dreams die before people do.</p> <p>Greville accepted the padlock key from the guard and put it in his pocket. \u201cYou\u2019re mine, cunt, for as long as I let you live.\u201d</p><p>No matter how many hours or days, it would be too long. Kim couldn\u2019t stop shaking, her chest so tight no air seemed to get through. Red and black wavered in her vision\u2014blood and death\u2014and she wanted it, wanted the oblivion.</p><p>Lord Greville pointed to the moaning Overseer. \u201cHaul him downstairs and have someone see to him. I need him able to sign the papers.\u201d He turned to check his bodyguards. One had managed to stand. The other was...was dead.</p><p>Kim stared at Master R. He\u2019d killed. And he was dying.</p><p>Her hands shook; her body shook. Don\u2019t die. She tried to turn him. Stop the bleeding. No room to move him, no room. Her hands clamped into fists.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll clear us leaving with the front door attendants,\u201d Greville said to the guard. \u201cGet three more men to carry the crate\u2014and something to cover it.\u201d He laughed. \u201cGood deal. Two slaves for the price of none.\u201d</p> <p>The door closed behind them with a solid thump.</p><p>A hand gripped on Kim\u2019s arm, and she jumped.</p><p>\u201cCari\u00f1o.\u201d Master R looked up at her, brown eyes completely alert.</p><p>\u201cMaster R?\u201d she whispered and stared at him. The scum-sucking bottom-feeder... He\u2019d been faking it.</p><p>His eyes were filled with laughter. With pride. \u201cSo, gatita with sharp claws, what did you do to Dahmer?\u201d</p><p>Sam knelt beside Linda. He\u2019d released her, lowered her to a sitting position despite her groggy protest.</p><p>The scrawny attendant pulled the portable St. Andrews into the aisle and frowned at Sam. \u201cPlease step out of the display area, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe needs a blanket and some water.\u201d Abandon a sub who was coming out of subspace?</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s up for sale, sir. Your time to sample the merchandise is over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it.\u201d God blast these bastards. He couldn\u2019t leave her so vulnerable. Sam slapped her face lightly. \u201cWake up, girl. Now.\u201d</p><p>She blinked, eyes focusing on him, then looked around the room, and her fear yanked her out of comfort faster than anything he could do.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Come on back,\u201d he said, smoothing her hair.</p><p>She pulled away from his hand, and her expression held...revulsion. Anger. \u201cDamn you,\u201d she whispered and shuddered.</p><p>Sam frowned. What\u2014why? \u201cLinda, what\u2014\u201d He saw the attendant signal for a guard and stopped. Can\u2019t draw that kind of attention. Or be forced from the vicinity. He rose to his feet, bent, and patted her shoulder. \u201cHang in there, girl.\u201d</p><p>She cringed away...from him.</p><p>He hesitated, then withdrew to outside the display area. That hadn\u2019t been fear she showed, but anger. Disgust. His lips tightened. He\u2019d stay close. She might not want help, but too bad.</p><p>Another buyer approached, looking almost mesmerized. No question as to why. The redhead might be older, but after taking what Sam had given, she had a...glow. Her lips were swollen, her face abraded, her breasts marked by his hands. Her eyes were heavy from how intensely she\u2019d come. She looked like a wet dream in chains.</p><p>The buyer, middle-aged with a hefty paunch, stared at Linda and started to signal to an attendant. Leaning an elbow on the pedestal, Sam said quietly, \u201cI\u2019m buying that one. You can play, but if I find one mark on her body that I didn\u2019t put there, I\u2019ll take that whip and knot it around your neck.\u201d</p><p>The man puffed up, trying to look bigger, and then yellow-dogged out. \u201cFine. If you\u2019re going to purchase her, no need to waste my time.\u201d He walked away, his attempt at dignity spoiled by a nervous glance over his shoulder.</p><p>Sam half-smiled, then looked over at Linda in satisfaction.</p><p>She stared back. Coldly.</p><p>He winced inside. Dammit, she hadn\u2019t acted like that before he\u2019d whipped her. Or when he\u2019d been getting her off. She begged\u2014he closed his eyes as the pieces started to fit. Dignified. Older. Not letting fear show in her manner. Controlled. Embarrassed by her own needs.</p><p>And he\u2019d taken those needs and reduced her to begging\u2014in front of others. The slavers who called her a slut.</p><p>Hell. He should have stopped at the whipping. Getting her off had been a fucking major mistake. It had seemed like a gift he could give, to help her escape her awareness of this place for a bit, but...females were odd creatures. Emotional. Rather than a gift, he\u2019d shown her how easily her own body would betray her.</p><p>He rubbed his hand over his mouth, wanting to swear up a storm. He\u2019d sliced into her defenses with less finesse than a baby dom with a new whip. After a glance at the attendant who still hovered nearby, Sam knew he couldn\u2019t explain to her, to apologize\u2014not here\u2014but when this was over, they\u2019d talk. Damn straight, they would.</p><p>Raoul struggled to reach down his leg but failed. With both of them stuffed in the cage, there wasn\u2019t enough room. \u201cChiquita, get the tool out of my right boot. On the outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I need to stop the bleeding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>With her mouth set in protest, she squirmed around and did as he asked, his sweet, sweet sumisa.</p><p>She frowned at it. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSafety tool. I always carry it if I\u2019m doing a scene.\u201d He twisted onto his right side. The pain ripped through him as his weight came onto his stabbed shoulder\u2014that knife-happy cabr\u00f3n. Sweat broke out on his forehead as tiny lights blurred his vision. \u201cMadre de Dios.\u201d</p><p>She examined the tool, opened the handles. \u201cLike scissors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMini bolt cutter,\u201d he said, taking them from her hand. Good for rope, wire, leather...</p><p>\u201cBut the lock\u2019s too big.\u201d The hope in her eyes died as she stared at the thickness of the steel padlock.</p><p>\u201cIt is, yes.\u201d Raoul snipped the wire above the lock. Then the one to the side. She gasped as she understood\u2014the lock need not be open if the wires around the latch were gone.</p><p>He clipped the last wire and shoved the door open, then pulled back. She scrambled out. He followed, muffling his groan as his back grazed the door frame. After a second, he pushed to his feet, her hand under his arm lending support.</p><p>Slow breath. He brought his body back under his control and then frowned at the unoccupied cage. \u201cI was going to leave you in there for him to see, but I need your help out here. If you would\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re bleeding like a stuck pig, you idiot,\u201d she said in a furious low voice. Such a temper, his tesoro. \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>God, he was going to bleed to death in front of her eyes. Swearing under her breath, she used his bolt cutters to cut up her leather harness. Linen napkins made an adequate crappy dressing, and she secured it all in place by knotting a long leather strap tightly around his chest. The wound on his shoulder\u2014she couldn\u2019t figure out how to contrive something for that.</p><p>He ignored her, studying the room. \u201cWe\u2019re directly across the hall from the top of the stairs. And there\u2019s a chair right outside. I should be able to get rid of one or two that way.\u201d</p><p>By sitting in a chair? How much blood had he lost?</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want to get trapped in here.\u201d He eyed the door, then made Kimberly push and angle the couch so someone entering wouldn\u2019t see the emptiness of the cage until they were well into the room.</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d she asked. There were going to be too many men for them. She knew it.</p><p>He pointed to the heavy ironwork lamp on the end table. \u201cGet that, gatita.\u201d</p><p>After she\u2019d unplugged and carried it back, he motioned for her to keep it. \u201cUse it on the first man through the door\u2014unless he\u2019s FBI, of course. Hit him in the head as hard as you can. I\u2019ll go after the others, and we will party.\u201d He waited a beat, then teased her, \u201cThis is when you say, \u2018It will be my pleasure, Master.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Master R\u2019s grin made her feel better, and how dumb was that? We\u2019re going to die here. Her chin came up. But she\u2019d do it fighting and not dying little by little in a cage. \u201cI always liked to party.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTesoro m\u00edo,\u201d he murmured. Andrea had said the words meant \u201cmy treasure.\u201d The approval in his eyes made her insides tremble\u2014and strengthened her legs. He needed her to be strong; she\u2019d give him anything he needed.</p><p>He tilted his head to listen, then pointed for her to stand behind the door and took the other side for himself.</p><p>Footsteps. Many. Men\u2019s voices. The horrible sharpness of Lord Greville\u2019s voice. No. She lifted the lamp over her head and braced her legs. Her hands shook, almost dislodging her grip, and she growled and steadied them. Master R nodded approval, increasing her determination. She\u2019d hold up her part. See if she didn\u2019t.</p><p>The door opened. \u201cCover the cage\u2014I don\u2019t want extra witnesses,\u201d Lord Greville said.</p> <p>Her heart was hammering, pounding, hitting her lungs. She couldn\u2019t\u2014couldn\u2019t move.</p><p>Someone walked into the room, the open door hiding him from her. \u201cYes, sir,\u201d the man said. One step past the door\u2019s edge, he spotted the empty cage.</p><p>She saw\u2014actually saw\u2014his mouth open, but the buzzing in her ears drowned out his yell. With a death grip on the base, she swung the heavily decorated solid iron lamp down onto his head. He fell like a rock.</p><p>She almost dropped the lamp. Blood streaked the back of his head. She stared, waited. His chest rose\u2014he was breathing, thank heavens.</p><p>As she started around him, the smooth iron base of the lamp slipped from her sweaty hands. My only weapon. She snatched it up, curling her fingers into the fancy ironwork on the top. The balance was poor, but at least she wouldn\u2019t drop it.</p> <p>She heard grunts and shouts outside the door. Master R. Fighting all the rest. By himself. Damn you, Kim. Move! She lurched into the hall and almost tripped on a man on the floor. Eyes open, chest caved in. A buzzing started in her ears. She edged past him and stopped, trying to see. So many men.</p><p>With a roar, Master R swung the chair that had been outside the door and knocked a man down the wide, steep stairs. Then he spun, bending forward, kicking backward to catch another in the groin. The man staggered, lost his footing, and yelled as he went over and down the stairs.</p><p>Off balance, Master R dropped the chair, staggering a few steps until he caught himself on the banister. Two more guards moved in.</p><p>And Lord Greville. Kim\u2019s blood turned cold. He\u2019d grabbed the chair. Master R\u2019s back was to him as he pulled the chair back like a bat.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Kim yelled.</p><p>Greville\u2019s head turned. His cold gaze stopped her...held her...</p> <p>No. Screaming her fear, her fury, she swung the lamp with all her strength. The heavy base hit Greville in the side of the head, and she felt something break as if the light bulb had shattered.</p><p>He fell, and his head... His head. The lamp dropped from numb fingers. The floor whirled under her feet: red carpet, red blood, red carpet...</p><p>She was on her hands and knees, choking, trying not to throw up. Cold sweat ran down her face. God, God, God.</p><p>Don\u2019t look. As the ringing in her ears subsided, she heard a low groan. Master R. She pushed up on trembling legs and turned. Still alive. Fighting. A man at his feet. More men ran up the stairs.</p><p>Raoul and Kim had disappeared to an unknown location, and Sam was ready to kill someone. No buyer was allowed outside of the ballroom unescorted, so he couldn\u2019t wander through the place, yelling for his pal. As the auction continued, less than a third of the buyers and slaves remained.</p><p>The FBI hadn\u2019t shown up. What did they do, stop for a beer first?</p><p>Finally, he spotted a dark jacket, another; then a steady flow of them streamed in under the arched ballroom door. About time. Vance followed. He exchanged glances with Sam and stopped nearby as his men moved up the aisle. Their presence was masked by the screaming and sobbing of slaves, the auctioneer\u2019s sick humor, and the perverted display on the stage.</p><p>In the front of the room, a door opened, revealing more men. Sam would give odds that they also surrounded the house. He wished he could see the Overseer\u2019s face right now...and where was he, anyway?</p> <p>A buyer jumped to his feet. \u201cCops!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo observant.\u201d Vance lifted a bullhorn. \u201cThis is the FBI. You will kneel on the floor, hands laced behind your heads. Any resistance will be met with deadly force.\u201d He lowered the bullhorn and added under his breath, \u201cYou fucking assholes.\u201d</p><p>No one moved.</p><p>Vance put the bullhorn to his lips again. \u201cSit!\u201d His voice whipped across the room with the authority of a hardened cop\u2014and a dom. Most of the slaves dropped instinctively to their knees, and a lot of buyers did as well.</p><p>Sam grinned and glanced at Linda, who was still on her feet. His slave was made of tough material. Mine. She studied Vance\u2014frowned at Sam, who wasn\u2019t moving either\u2014then knelt as well.</p><p>Galen limped up to Sam and gave him an assessing look before asking, \u201cWhere\u2019s Raoul and his sub?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know.\u201d Sam scowled. \u201cThe Overseer took them somewhere outside the ballroom.\u201d</p><p>Kim screamed as a guard hit Master R from the side, slamming him into the wall. He grunted in pain, started to fall, then caught himself.</p><p>Another headed for him.</p><p>Kim lurched for the guard, turning at the last minute to kick the side of his knee. Pain shot up her ankle, but as Master R had promised, the guy went down, bellowing curses. She jumped for another\u2014spoiling his blow at Master R\u2014and punched the side of his neck, even as he backhanded her. Her butt hit the floor, her head a second later with a cracking blast of pain. The lights dimmed, turned black. She moaned. No. Can\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cFBI. Freeze!\u201d</p><p>Through unfocused eyes, Kim stared up at the slaver over her, at his furious eyes. She braced for his kick... Then he raised his hands and stepped back.</p><p>She lay for a second, pain ripping through her head with each pulse beat, then managed to sit up. Her stomach lurched, nausea churning, making her swallow and swallow again. The room whirled, a merry-go-round of lights. And finally slowed to a stop.</p><p>Vance was at the top of the stairs, several uniformed police coming up behind him. Unable to stand, Kim watched as two uniforms dealt with the men Master R had knocked down the steps. One was handcuffed and taken away. The other didn\u2019t move. The remaining officer checked for a pulse and left him there.</p><p>Master R. Where was he? Dread clawing at her, Kim turned the other way. Thank you, God.</p><p>Still standing, Master R was propped up by the wall as he gasped for air. The white napkins she\u2019d used on his wound were soaked with blood.</p><p>Kim moaned.</p><p>He glanced at Vance and Dan, then looked around and spotted her. His intent gaze ran over her body, returned to her face, and he actually smiled. \u201cBueno.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaoul,\u201d Vance said. \u201cYou\u2019re a mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re late.\u201d Master R winced and put his hand over the linen napkins.</p><p>\u201cAsshole. Where\u2019re you hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the back,\u201d Kim said, talking right over her master. \u201cAnd over his ribs, and he\u2019s been bleeding forever.\u201d She tried to stand, but the world started to disappear halfway up.</p><p>\u201cNo, gatita!\u201d Master R took a step toward her. His knees buckled, and he fell back against the wall. He slid down, leaving a bloody trail on the wallpaper.</p><p>Oh God. Kim crawled frantically. \u201cNo no no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMedic!\u201d Vance yelled. He pulled Master R forward, netting himself a foul curse in Spanish. \u201cThat\u2019s a knife wound. Thought they couldn\u2019t have weapons,\u201d Vance growled, easing the leather vest off Master R\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>Still alive. He\u2019s alive. \u201cIt\u2019s from a dinner tray,\u201d Kim said.</p><p>\u201cUgly hole,\u201d Vance muttered. He pulled off his black jacket and ripped the sleeve from his white shirt. After shoving it against the bleeding shoulder wound and getting cursed again, he looked at Kim. \u201cYou able to keep pressure on this?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, ignoring the pain in her head. Just watch me.</p><p>\u201cGood enough.\u201d</p><p>Galen appeared, leaning heavily on his cane. He had jackets under his arm and tossed one over Kim\u2019s shoulders and another over Master R\u2019s legs. \u201cThat might keep you from being dumped into the slammer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa!\u201d A yell came from nearby. \u201cLooks like this mother\u2019s not going anywhere. His skull\u2019s cracked like an eggshell.\u201d</p><p>A younger deputy at the top of the stairs reversed course, his face green. I know the feeling, Kim thought. Along with the painful throbbing, her head kept replaying that shattering sound. She tried to swallow.</p><p>A firm grip on her knee got her attention. \u201cCari\u00f1o? Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>She smiled down into Master R\u2019s worried brown eyes. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>With an FBI jacket over his shoulders, Sam worked his way back into the ballroom, shoving past a cop and the buyer he\u2019d threatened earlier.</p><p>\u201cHey! Arrest him too. He was whipping a slave,\u201d the asshole shouted.</p><p>The police officer frowned at Sam, then the jacket he wore. \u201cWait one minute, please.\u201d He pulled a notepad from his pocket, flipped to a set of thumbnail photos. Sam saw his own face, Kim\u2019s, and Raoul\u2019s. The cop nodded politely at him and gave the slaver a push. \u201cLet\u2019s go, you.\u201d</p><p>Sam shook his head. The two feebies had definitely tried to make sure their civilian undercover people were safe. Holding the blanket he\u2019d found, he headed back to Linda. An FBI agent with a bolt cutter had just gotten her unchained from the long cable. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sam scowled. That was inefficient at best. \u201cYou know,\u201d he told the agent, \u201cif you could locate the asshole called the Overseer or Dahmer, he\u2019d probably have master keys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seen him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe the kitchen or upstairs. He\u2019s not in the ballroom.\u201d</p><p>The feebie motioned for a uniform. \u201cGet a description from this man and find the Overseer guy. Try the kitchen first, then upstairs.\u201d</p> <p>Sam filled the cop in and turned to his woman. \u201cLinda.\u201d He kept his eyes on her.</p><p>She stiffened, her gaze on the floor. Embarrassed. Hell.</p><p>He stepped forward and wrapped her in the blanket.</p><p>The agent with the bolt cutters was working on the next woman\u2019s chain. He looked up. \u201cHey, where\u2019d the blanket come from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a stack in the closet by the front door.\u201d Sam pulled the blanket more securely around Linda.</p> <p>Streaks of red appeared on her cheeks. She stared stubbornly at the floor. Dammit.</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d he growled.</p><p>Her eyes lifted. Pretty, pretty brown, then down again.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re going to take you all to a ward in the hospital where the docs can check you out. The feebies will be doing interviews. I doubt they\u2019ll let me in to see you.\u201d His jaw hardened when she didn\u2019t answer. Unease tightened his gut, flattened his voice. \u201cGive me a way to contact you.\u201d</p><p>Her chin jerked up, and she gave him a stunned look of revulsion. \u201cNo. Never.\u201d She took a step back from him. \u201cI never want to see you again.\u201d Another step back. Her lush mouth had flattened in a tight line.</p><p>He saw her shiver and knew she feared reprisal for the rudeness, but her determination to keep him away had been enough to risk it. He could read her as clearly as if he\u2019d been in her head.</p> <p>The agent dealing with the next slave over frowned.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t the time to push. He\u2019d made a hell of a mistake with her, going with the scene dynamics, and not taking into account the rest of the world. \u201cAll right. My name is Sam. When... If you want to reach me, ask at the Shadowlands here in Tampa.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cBe well, Linda.\u201d</p><p>She looked away.</p><p>They\u2019d taken Master R from her, said they were airlifting him to a hospital. Kim had watched, still unable to stand, unable to do anything except shiver.</p><p>He was gone. She was alone. The memories of shattering, blood, and screaming kept surging forward in waves, twisting her stomach. If she could manage to get to her feet, maybe she could... Where would she go?</p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019re you doing here?\u201d a cop asked brusquely and tried to yank her up. She yelped and grabbed her ribs. The Overseer had gotten in a good punch. He stopped pulling but didn\u2019t let go. \u201cYou slaves are supposed to all be in the ballroom</p><p>until\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not slaves, now are they?\u201d A cold, gravelly voice. Kim looked up as Master Sam</p> <p>walked over. \u201cLast time I looked, slavery was outlawed in this country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. I\u2019m sorry, sir.\u201d The cop released her and took a step away. \u201cUm\u2014\u201d Sam moved in front of the officer and knelt. \u201cAre you all right, Kim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy master.\u201d Her mind blanked on the name. \u201cMy...my Master R. I need to go there.\u201d</p><p>Where he is. \u201cHe\u2019s hurt. I need to go there.\u201d</p><p>Sam didn\u2019t answer, just wrapped the blanket he held around her and over the black jacket she wore. When did she get a jacket? Her thoughts stuttered, started forward again. If her head would just stop hurting... She pulled the covering closer. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s better.\u201d His hand cupped her chin before she could dodge. After turning her face to each side, he examined the lump at the back of her head. Pain burst behind her eyeballs. He frowned at the blood on his fingers. \u201cYou\u2019re banged up, girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy master. I need to go to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d He made an exasperated sound. \u201cDan arranged for us to go to the hospital with the first bunch of women. We\u2019ll get you seen by a doc, and you can see Raoul.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, taking it in, although her mind seemed to be awfully slow.</p><p>Maybe he realized, since he didn\u2019t move. \u201cYou\u2019re not tracking too good, are you?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d take her to Master R. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d The floor insisted on moving in waves, upsetting her balance. Wait. Something else. Someone. \u201cLinda?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s okay. She\u2019ll get processed with the rest. Galen wouldn\u2019t make an exception in her case.\u201d Sam wrapped an arm around her.</p><p>She tried to jerk away, and he waited, not releasing her. As she saw his pale blue eyes, she remembered. Master R\u2019s friend. \u201cSorry, Sir.\u201d</p><p>He simply smiled and lifted her to her feet. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Halfway down, she saw... She fought from Sam\u2019s grip, bent, and picked up a black collar. And fell forward.</p><p>With a curse, Sam grabbed her and yanked her back upright. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing, girl?\u201d</p><p>She ran her fingers over the leather, the silver engraving. Her grip tightened when he tried to take it. \u201cMine.\u201d</p><p>Instead of fighting her, he turned the collar in her hands so he could read the writing. Master Raoul\u2019s gatita. \u201cYours.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>Raoul opened his eyes and frowned. Bed with shiny metal railings, white walls, Marcus sitting in a chair. Auction, fight. As his memory returned, he tried to sit up and grunted at the flare of pain in his shoulder and ribs. He remembered the ER crew checking his back. He\u2019d only cursed once. Then they\u2019d moved to his front. Carajo, he hadn\u2019t liked seeing the white flashes of his rib cage when they\u2019d checked to see how deep it was.</p><p>\u201cWhen my sister was ten, she got a sewing kit,\u201d Marcus said in his easy Southern drawl. He pulled his chair closer and used the controls to raise the head of Raoul\u2019s bed. \u201cYou look like one of the stuffed bears she...mended. Stitches everywhere.\u201d</p><p>Friends were a joy to the heart, Raoul reminded himself. \u201cThank you.\u201d The auction. Anxiety welled inside him. \u201cWhere\u2019s Kimberly?\u201d</p><p>Marcus gave an exaggerated sigh. \u201cShe\u2019s in the ER being checked over, but she\u2019s all right. Sam is with her. They should never have doped you up to give you stitches.\u201d</p><p>Raoul relaxed. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA pleasant dopehead you\u2019re not. Every time your eyes open, you ask about Kim...then try to get down to the ER. You punched an orderly, by the way. The nurses dragged me in here to reassure you she\u2019s alive.\u201d Marcus grinned. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve been telling you that every five minutes since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. And thank you.\u201d Raoul frowned. \u201cHave you checked on her recently?\u201d Sam was good. He\u2019d watch out for her. Wouldn\u2019t he? Scowling, Raoul looked up at the IV bag hanging on a pole, traced the plastic tubing to the needle in the back of his hand. He could yank it out.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try it,\u201d Marcus said, his Southern accent not covering up the steel beneath. \u201cI\u2019d sit on you, and then they\u2019d put it back in. You lost enough blood to worry them. And me.\u201d</p><p>Giving up for the moment, Raoul asked, \u201cDid they catch everyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did,\u201d Galen Kouros said from the doorway. Weariness lined his face as he walked into the room, leaning heavily on his cane. \u201cI am very tired of visiting you pushy bastards in the hospital after you get damaged in my operations.\u201d</p><p>Raoul snorted and had to suck in against the groan. The skin on his ribs felt as if it wanted to split open again. \u201cNo jokes,\u201d he gritted out.</p><p>From behind Kouros, Z appeared. He pointed to the pain-control device. \u201cUse that, Raoul.\u201d</p><p>Raoul scowled. \u201cI will wait to see my sumi\u2014see Kimberly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have her wake you up if you\u2019re asleep.\u201d Z picked up the remote and pushed the button, smiling at Raoul\u2019s curse. \u201cDon\u2019t get into a pissing contest with me when you\u2019re flat on your back. You\u2019ll just get wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCabr\u00f3n.\u201d</p><p>Z grinned. \u201cYou can stop worrying about her, you know. I stopped in the ER and sent Sam home. Kim is getting X-rays. Then Jessica and Gabi will bring her up.\u201d He glanced at Marcus. \u201cI don\u2019t think the doctors stand a chance against the three of them.\u201d</p><p>The pain medicine hit. It felt as if the bed dropped away a couple of feet, but the burning in his shoulder and ribs eased to a mild smolder. Z was still a bastard. \u201cWhat else?\u201d he asked Kouros.</p><p>\u201cThe upstairs looked like a war zone. One man had his skull smashed in\u2014which Kim said was her work.\u201d</p><p>Raoul winced. He\u2019d glimpsed the end of Greville. She should not have had to do that. \u201cIs she\u2014you made her talk about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince you weren\u2019t available, yes. She held together until she finished...then spent the next ten minutes throwing up. Dammit.\u201d Kouros gave him a level stare. \u201cFrom what I know of your background, you\u2019ve seen your share of violence. She\u2019ll be all right, but you know it takes a while.\u201d</p><p>Raoul nodded.</p><p>\u201cFor you, you caved in one man\u2019s chest, one died going headfirst down the steps, one from a crushed trachea. Most of the rest are in a world of hurt. Nice job.\u201d Kouros thought for a moment. \u201cThe Overseer is in surgery right now\u2014and he talked quite a bit while we were waiting for his transport.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think he\u2019d change sides so quickly,\u201d Raoul said.</p><p>\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t end up completely blinded, he\u2019d have such poor vision that\u201d\u2014Kouros had a grim smile\u2014\u201che\u2019d make an excellent fucktoy for some big joe in prison. He didn\u2019t like the idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI rather do.\u201d Marcus\u2019s eyes were cold. \u201cGabi still has nightmares from being kidnapped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Jessica,\u201d Z said.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Kouros said heavily. \u201cBut on the bright side, the Harvest Association has lost this quadrant. And with the personnel and the buyers, we\u2019ve got enough information to dig out the ringleaders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the kidnapped women?\u201d Z asked.</p><p>\u201cCan go home,\u201d Kouros said. \u201cThe Association is going to be too busy looking for caves to indulge in any reprisals.\u201d</p><p>Kimberly could return to her family. \u201cThat\u2014that is good.\u201d She\u2019d leave. He felt as if someone was ripping out his stitches one by one.</p><p>Women\u2019s laughter came from the hall, warming the sterility of the room. Gabi and Jessica walked in, followed by Kimberly.</p> <p>Alive. On her feet. The knot of worry in his chest loosened; the ache of loss didn\u2019t.</p><p>She limped to the bed and smiled down at him. \u201cYou look horrible\u2014and so much better than I thought you would.\u201d</p><p>She had a bruised face, split lip. Her leg had been hurt somehow. Her body moved...stiffly, as if to guard from pain. She had lines of strain around her eyes and mouth, but she could smile. Such an indomitable spirit.</p><p>He opened his palm, giving her the choice, and the world turned brighter when her small hand slid into his. \u201cWhat did the doctor say, gatita?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a thousand or so stitches in your\u2014\u201d</p><p>He narrowed his eyes. \u201cAbout you.\u201d Thinking more clearly, he turned to Jessica, defender of the subbies. \u201cWhat did her doctor say?\u201d</p> <p>Ignoring Kimberly\u2019s glare, Jessica glanced at Z, received a quick smile and nod, and reported, \u201cAside from the damage to her face, she\u2019s got an ugly bruise over her ribs\u2014but nothing broken\u2014and a twisted ankle. Nothing broken there either. A concussion, and they want her to spend the night.\u201d Jessica grinned at her friend. \u201cShe got out of the wheelchair just outside this room, \u2019cause you might worry. \u2019Bout as stubborn as you are.\u201d</p><p>As Jessica finished, Raoul used Kimberly\u2019s arm as a leash to pull her down. He needed her lips, her fragrance, her gentleness, and he savored them all as her soft mouth moved over his. They would have to talk soon but...not yet.</p><p>Right after Z and Jessica left, a nurse showed up for Kim\u2014and Master R ordered her to be an obedient patient. The obstinate blowfish. God, she didn\u2019t want to leave him.</p><p>The hospital staff and FBI had talked about splitting the rescued women into different hospitals and rooms, but Gabi\u2019d taken charge, and they discovered the women preferred to stay together, at least for now. Kim understood completely. Safety in numbers, others who comprehended what had happened, friendships formed in suffering. Until their families arrived, each other was all these women had.</p><p>In the big room filled with ex-slaves, the nurse tucked Kim into a bed next to Linda, took her vital signs, and increased her headache by shining a light in her eyes.</p><p>But she was a nice nurse and showed up a few minutes later with pain medication in repayment for the flashlight torture. For a while, Kim talked with Linda, sharing tears and comfort over Holly\u2019s death, and relief that the slavery nightmare was over.</p><p>Linda told Kim not to be mad at Sam for whipping her, that he\u2019d had no choice. He\u2019d given her a safe word, and she\u2019d agreed. But...then she wouldn\u2019t talk about it anymore. Something was wrong.</p><p>Linda\u2019s eyes were drooping, and she drifted off before Kim could think of a tactful question.</p> <p>All around the room, women were sleeping, crying quietly, and talking to the counselors who\u2019d arrived with Gabi. Thanks to the Overseer\u2019s care of the \u201cmerchandise,\u201d most weren\u2019t hurt badly\u2014at least not physically. And they\u2019d be able to go home.</p><p>As Kim looked around, her anxiety kept increasing. The shaking had started deep inside while she talked with Linda, slowly expanding. Her hands were quivering like a palm in high winds. Dammit, everyone else can get to sleep. Why not me?</p><p>Maybe I should have talked to someone. She hadn\u2019t told Linda about Lord Greville or about the fight. She\u2019d fended Gabi off too, saying she wasn\u2019t ready to discuss anything yet. There would be time later since as an FBI victim specialist, Gabi would be here every day until the kidnapped women went home.</p><p>Kim wrapped her arms around her waist, feeling hollow. Empty. After this was over, would there be anything left of her? I need to move, to do something. She slid out of the bed, her hospital gown flapping, but at least the ER nurses had given her matching pajama bottoms. She wouldn\u2019t forget their little kindnesses.</p><p>Only slightly dizzy, she walked the halls, holding the railing along the walls. The scents varied as she moved past the doors: disinfectant, sickness, excrement. Her muscles tired; her feet started to drag. Go back to bed, she told herself.</p><p>But the numbers were familiar, and then she knew. She\u2019d thought she was wandering at random, but...somehow she ended up at Master R\u2019s room.</p><p>As she peeked in, her heart did a slow tumble. Not everything inside her was hollow.</p><p>He was still awake, scowling at a small dish on the tray table. A middle-of-the-night snack?</p><p>\u201cDo you need help eating?\u201d she asked, walking over.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of a meal is Jell-O? And it\u2019s green. Food shouldn\u2019t be green.\u201d He frowned at her, his eyes turning intent, although his voice stayed easy. \u201cA beer would be more welcome. Come here, gatita.\u201d He held his hand out.</p><p>She put her fingers in his, feeling the calluses, the careful strength. But seeing him didn\u2019t help. Nothing would help her, she realized, and tried to pull back. \u201cYou need sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you should be in your bed as well.\u201d He smiled at her. \u201cPut the side rail down and sit beside me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019ll hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, sumisita.\u201d</p><p>God, when he used that tone, sometimes\u2014rarely\u2014she could disobey him. Not today.</p><p>As she slid the rail down, he lowered the head of the bed, then took her forearm and pulled her to sit on the edge. She knew moving and being jostled must hurt him, but nothing showed on his face.</p><p>\u201cAll right, I\u2019m here. Are you happy?\u201d Sitting stiffly upright, she scowled at him.</p><p>\u201cNot yet. Galen said you told him what had happened. Did you tell him how you felt as well?\u201d</p><p>She tried to rise, and his grip tightened. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you will.\u201d The corner of his mouth tipped up. \u201cAs will I, and then we\u2019ll hold each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>His chin tilted up slightly, and she discovered she\u2019d used up all the defiance in her soul. Her gaze dropped.</p><p>\u201cBueno. I\u2019ll begin. When you said the person in the room was Greville, I was angry. And scared that we\u2019d been set up.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d never shown any of that. She looked up. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was very afraid, Kimberly.\u201d His fingers curled around her hand, and his thumb stroked circles on the back. \u201cAnd you? You didn\u2019t seem angry,\u201d he prompted after a second of silence.</p><p>\u201cI-I was so\u201d\u2014her eyes filled as the memory swamped her\u2014\u201cso scared. I knew I\u2019d die.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cYou thought I\u2019d leave you?\u201d</p><p>The trembling spread until she could feel the whole bed shake. \u201cI knew he\u2019d make you go. He wouldn\u2019t give you a choice, and...\u201d And she\u2019d be alone and screaming as she died.</p><p>He sighed and pulled her down onto him. She struggled. \u201cNo, I\u2019ll hurt you.\u201d He huffed a pained laugh. \u201cIf you fight me, yes. I feel stitches popping already.\u201d She froze, staring at the white gauze dressings on his bare chest.</p><p>\u201cLie beside me, gatita.\u201d As she complied, he gave a grunt of satisfaction, settling her with her head in the hollow of his unhurt shoulder. Warmth streamed from him like sunlight, and her coldness receded. Her sigh shuddered her whole body.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d His big hand stroked her hair; his other arm curled around her back, holding her securely against him. \u201cGatita, don\u2019t you realize I need you in my arms as much as you need to be here.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes at the reassurance. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>His low baritone laugh was as intimate as being held. \u201cNow we must talk about what happened so our memories process correctly, no?\u201d He\u2019d had a fascination for her counseling sessions, studying PTSD as if he were a researcher. \u201cMy turn. I knew it was all going to hell. I wanted you to run\u2014but you came back. I\u2019ve never been so scared.\u201d He inhaled and growled. \u201cI am very proud of you, sumisita m\u00eda, but I intend to beat you for disobeying me.\u201d</p><p>She giggled into his shoulder, knowing he\u2019d do no such thing. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of you too, but I should smack you for not letting me fight beside you.\u201d</p><p>He grunted. \u201cYou did well with the Overseer and the guards. And Greville.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her breath hitched. Swinging the heavy lamp, fury and terror filling her, feeling the shattering sensation. The indescribable sound he made, the thump of his body hitting the floor. Her eyes welled with tears, and she let them this time. \u201cI killed him.\u201d</p><p>Master R\u2019s hand stroked down her arm. \u201cI know.\u201d Another stroke. \u201cThe only choice was his death or ours. Galen says I killed several as well.\u201d</p><p>She sniffled, her tears dampening his chest. He was a man. He probably\u2014</p><p>\u201cI have killed before, and it\u2019s never grown easier to handle afterward. There will always be a part of you that feels guilty. Blackened.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou too?\u201d</p><p>His bitter laugh teased her hair. \u201cI\u2019m not God, and killing another is wrong. We will both mourn the deaths we gave and be angry and want to yell at the bastards for forcing us to it.\u201d He nuzzled the top of her head. \u201cAnd since I am a man, I would appreciate it if you would cry for us both, gatita.\u201d</p><p>Wrong. Mourn. Anger. Grief. A sob choked her, and then it all spilled out, just tears after all, in safety with someone who could take comfort from her in return.</p><p>Sunday afternoon, Kim sat beside the hospital bed and watched Master R\u2019s face as he slept. His color had improved, and the frown had disappeared from his forehead. The nurse had given him a gown this morning, and again, he\u2019d tossed it at the foot of the bed. But this way, Kim could see the bandages on his bare chest. The white gauze showed only a few red splotches rather than being blood-soaked.</p><p>She grinned. He\u2019d be growly when he woke and realized the pain meds had knocked him into sleeping again. And he\u2019d blame her, since she\u2019d gotten good at detecting when he was hurting, and cajoling him into using the button. A shame she didn\u2019t have the nerve to push it herself like Master Z would.</p> <p>Earlier she\u2019d sent Gabi and Marcus home since her so very polite master wouldn\u2019t let himself fall asleep if he had visitors. Obviously he didn\u2019t consider her company. The thought set up a glow inside her. And he slept better if he was holding her hand. She\u2019d pulled away a few times, and he\u2019d awoken within a minute. Some sort of dom radar, maybe.</p><p>She slept better beside him too. After returning to the room full of women, she\u2019d spent a sleepless night and sneaked back here before dawn. Master R had been reading. She\u2019d pulled up a chair and rested her head beside his hand...just for a second...and had woken up a couple of hours later when Cullen and Andrea arrived. He\u2019d been sleeping too, his fingers tangled in her hair.</p><p>God, she loved him.</p><p>He\u2019d risked his life for hers. \u201cRun,\u201d he\u2019d said and taken on everyone to let her get away. He could have let Lord Greville have her, but he wouldn\u2019t. Not her master.</p><p>Master . Dammit. Every time she thought about staying\u2014if he even wanted her to stay\u2014 the word bubbled up inside her with its sweet, terrifying sound. Master. And she was a slave.</p><p>Only he\u2019d said she wasn\u2019t. Submissive. She still didn\u2019t want him to take her decisions away, to control her. Why didn\u2019t I ever ask him what he wanted from a...person? A lover? Would he be happy with her love and what she would give him? How much of her, of her life and her soul, would he demand?</p> <p>They\u2019d lived like Master/slave, but that was to get her ready for the slavers. And yeah, she\u2019d begged for him to continue as her master. He had. She\u2019d knelt at his feet. He\u2019d fed her from his hand, even during the briefing.</p><p>She scowled. Surely she\u2019d just needed that extra week of security because of her kidnapping.</p><p>He didn\u2019t seem to think so.</p><p>Could she be happy living the lifestyle? God, I don\u2019t know. She stared at him. When he looked at her in a certain way, she\u2019d do anything. His voice could take her anywhere.</p><p>He had powerful hands, gentle and unyielding, the same as he was himself, compassionate with a solid core of...honor. Like her mother would say, \u201cThis man has character.\u201d She could lean on him; he\u2019d keep her safe. How could she leave?</p><p>\u201cHere, Mam\u00e1.\u201d A female voice with a light Spanish accent.</p><p>Kim turned as two women entered the room. One older and slightly stooped in a floral dress. Her face was wrinkled with age, hands gnarled with arthritis, and she possessed the dignity of someone who\u2019d worked all her life.</p><p>The other was around Kim\u2019s age, an attractive woman with a sturdy, big-boned body in jeans and a loose top. She appeared familiar... Black hair, chocolate brown eyes, Hispanic coloring, and Master R\u2019s strong jaw in feminine form.</p> <p>\u201cAre you Mas\u2014Raoul\u2019s family?\u201d Kim asked, flushing at her wayward tongue.</p><p>The older woman hadn\u2019t seen her, her gaze only on Master R, and she jumped. As the two women turned toward Kim, horror filled their faces.</p><p>What? Then she remembered her banged-up face. \u201cSorry about the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have come,\u201d the younger one interrupted and walked out of the room.</p><p>What the heck was that about? \u201cWait,\u201d Kim said. The older one hesitated, and Master R awoke.</p><p>\u201cMam\u00e1,\u201d he said, his voice more of a rasp than smooth. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>The old woman took a step forward, wringing her hands. \u201cThe hospital called. I am listed as your family.\u201d</p><p>How could a mother be so stiff with her son? With Master R, who was never cold with his friends?</p><p>\u201cAh. I\u2019m sorry, Mam\u00e1. I didn\u2019t realize you were\u2014\u201d He broke off, his jaw tightening. \u201cMam\u00e1, this is Kim. Kimberly, my mother, Anna Sandoval.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Mrs. Sandoval asked Kim.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, thank you.\u201d Why didn\u2019t she ask Master R how he was? No one could miss the bulky bandages taped to his ribs. This was too awkward. Kim squeezed Master R\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019m going to get some coffee. I\u2019ll be back in a bit.\u201d</p><p>She stepped out of the room and came face-to-face with the other woman.</p><p>\u201cUh, hi.\u201d God, no two strangers looked that much alike. \u201cAre you his sister?\u201d Kim asked.</p><p>When the woman\u2019s mouth tightened, she looked so much like Master R that Kim almost laughed.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m Lucia. Are you his slave?\u201d</p><p>What the\u2014Kim felt the flush run up into her face. \u201cAh, not really. I\u2019m Kim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is my brother, but I cannot let him...\u201d The woman straightened her shoulders. \u201cMaybe you think it\u2019s all fun, but it\u2019s not. It isn\u2019t safe to be with him. He\u2019ll hurt you, beat you so badly you cannot walk. Don\u2019t stay with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>His sister nodded, her mouth tight. \u201cHe likes to hurt women. To make them scream. To keep them as slaves and not let them leave.\u201d</p><p>His mother walked out of the room, closing the door behind her. She\u2019d obviously heard the last part of the sentence. Tears filled her eyes. She nodded.</p><p>Kim stared. The two women believed that garbage. A shiver ran through her as her own nagging fears stepped into the light. Not Master R. \u201cWhy would you say such a thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d his mother said. She looked at her daughter helplessly.</p><p>\u201cHis wife,\u201d Lucia said. \u201cThey broke up so suddenly. Got a divorce.\u201d</p><p>The mother touched her lips. \u201cRaoul would not talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlicia told me\u201d\u2014Lucia nodded at her mother\u2014\u201cshowed us both what he had done to her. She had welts and bruises and bleeding places all over her body. Her wrists were ripped from being chained to a wall.\u201d Her gaze fell on Kim\u2019s wrists, which bore the light abrasions from the rope Master R had used on the sailboat.</p><p>\u201cWhat they did, was...something they both wanted,\u201d Kim said, trying to think of Master R hurting someone so badly. His wife. \u201cIt\u2019s called consensual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d his mother said sharply. \u201cNo consent. Alicia said she screamed and begged, and he wouldn\u2019t let her go. He made her his slave, and she didn\u2019t want that. She hated him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen she got free, she ran away. Divorced him,\u201d Lucia said. \u201cShe lives somewhere else now.\u201d</p><p>His mother turned her face toward the wall and whispered, \u201cAlicia said he let others...have her. Abuse her. I love him, but I cannot act as if he is my son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe admitted it. Leave him while he\u2019s here in the hospital,\u201d Lucia urged.</p><p>His mother touched the bruise on Kim\u2019s cheek and shook her head. The two women walked away, the younger supporting the older.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Kim whispered. \u201cHe didn\u2019t. He couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Raoul closed his eyes, grief filling him faster than the returning pain. Mam\u00e1. He hadn\u2019t seen her in almost three years. She\u2019d come because he was hurt, but had taken one look at Kimberly and known he was still in the lifestyle.</p><p>Raoul tipped his head back and stared at the ceiling, the taste of bitterness familiar.</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t Alicia settled for being unfaithful? That had been enough of a blow. A horrible one\u2014coming home early to find his wife tied to a sawhorse bench, covered in welts and stripes, her brother-in-law fucking her in the ass.</p><p>Raoul had taken a step forward, thinking Randolph had whipped her, was raping her\u2014he\u2019d kill the man. But he heard Alicia demanding for more pain, for him to fuck her harder. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He hadn\u2019t killed either of them. Maybe he should have. He\u2019d filed for divorce...and in revenge, she\u2019d told Mam\u00e1 about her son, the dom. The master. Raoul had tried to explain the BDSM lifestyle to Mam\u00e1. All she saw was that her son was a pervert. Sick. An abuser.</p><p>Raoul sighed, his throat tight. Her eyes used to light up when he came home. She\u2019d scold him in Spanish for being so long away. Now her gaze held revulsion.</p><p>The phone on the bedside table rang, and Raoul grunted in pain as he stretched to answer it. \u201cSandoval.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, buddy.\u201d Cullen\u2019s hearty voice blasted through the phone. \u201cGalen sent me to pick up Kim\u2019s mom at the airport. We\u2019re downstairs. Can you tell Kim she has company?\u201d</p><p>Her mother. \u201cIs she a good woman? Able to care for her daughter?\u201d Raoul asked slowly, trying not to let his growing loss show in his voice.</p><p>He didn\u2019t succeed, for Cullen\u2019s voice turned cautious. \u201cSeems to be. She\u2019s been in tears half the time and furious at the slavers the rest. Good thing none of them are within her reach. Reminds me of Jessica. And your Kim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBueno.\u201d Blackness welled inside him, until the air itself seemed to darken. The time had come. \u201cBring her to the waiting room at the end of my hallway. I will meet you there.\u201d</p><p>Kimberly should not remain with him longer. She needed to heal, and once she did, he doubted he\u2019d ever see her again. To step back into a D/s relationship would be more than she could tolerate, no matter how brave she was.</p><p>And she was so very courageous. She\u2019d tried to protect him, had crawled into a cage to save him, had killed a man.</p><p>Last night, in his lightless room, she\u2019d sat on the foot of his bed, and the hall light had haloed her small figure as if her soul had turned luminous. Her spirit, despite all the hurt, remained beautiful and giving.</p><p>But she\u2019d given enough. He swallowed the tightness in his throat away. The next meeting would play out as it should, and then it would all be over. As would the dreams he hadn\u2019t realized he\u2019d held. Foolish Sandoval. She\u2019d made no secret of the fact that she didn\u2019t want a Master/slave relationship or to be a full-time submissive. Even if she hadn\u2019t lived through what she had, she still wouldn\u2019t have wanted it.</p><p>Yes, before the auction, she\u2019d asked him to continue as her master, but she\u2019d only needed someone to cling to.</p><p>He scowled. Yet she\u2019d been happy with him. Content. Fulfilled. He hadn\u2019t imagined that. He should give her a choice.</p><p>First, he\u2019d meet her mother. Make sure his gatita would be cared for if she went home. He glanced at the IV bag and started undoing the tape holding the needle in his arm.</p><p>Kim sat on a chair in the cafeteria, watching the torrents of rain outside the hospital, listening to the bone-shaking thunder. Thunderstorms, waves... No matter what stupid things humans did, the universe continued. The tides rose and fell; storms rolled in off the ocean; the sun came up every morning.</p><p>Life went on.</p><p>What about my life? Galen said she could go home now.</p><p>Home. She frowned as lightning flashed from cloud to cloud, and a few seconds later,</p><p>thunder rumbled.</p><p>Go back to Savannah? To what was familiar. Away from slavers and FBI and kidnapped women. Homesickness surged in her, pushing her like the gusts of wind outside. She needed to return to her own life, her work, her duplex, her friends. Her mom.</p><p>Time to go home. But...Master R? The thought of leaving him made her chest ache as if the lightning had hit it. She pushed to her feet and headed back to his room.</p><p>Could she bear to not see him anymore? To never again feel his hand on her head, or kneel at his feet, or hear the warm pleasure in his voice when she anticipated his needs. But then other memories oozed up, nauseating her: the Overseer stomping on her foot, Lord Greville whipping her until blood ran down her legs, the cage trapping her.</p><p>She froze in the center of the hall and concentrated on breathing. I can\u2019t go through that again. Master R\u2019s mother said he was an abuser...but he wasn\u2019t. He couldn\u2019t be. But Mrs. Sandoval was so sure. What am I going to do?</p> <p>She stopped in his doorway.</p><p>He looked exhausted. Pale. Hurting. Had he tried to get up to use the bathroom? Stubborn dom. \u201cI think you need to push the button for your pain medication,\u201d she said sternly.</p><p>He glanced at the IV, his expression odd. Then he looked at her. His gaze was intent, as if memorizing her face, lingering on the puffy bruise on her left cheek, the tender split in her lip. His mouth tightened. \u201cI did not care for you very well, did I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m alive. Not a slave. We took down a slave ring.\u201d The expressionless look on his face sent warnings shooting through her in small unsettling flashes. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Ma\u2014Raoul?\u201d</p><p>His muscles tensed, as if she\u2019d hit him. He looked at her with a shadowed gaze. \u201cNothing is wrong. You have a visitor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho? More cops?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this time.\u201d His smile didn\u2019t reach his eyes. \u201cThey\u2019re done with us\u2014at least until they start the legal maneuvering.\u201d He lifted his hand as if to touch her. \u201cYou can go home now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can?\u201d He was sending her away. The realization felt like a blow, crueler than the Overseer\u2019s fist into her ribs, solid enough to force her a step back.</p><p>He hesitated, and then asked slowly, \u201cWhat do want to do, Kimberly?\u201d</p><p>A surge of hope shivered through her body. He was giving her the choice. She wouldn\u2019t have to leave him.</p><p>Only she wanted to go home. Didn\u2019t she? No, I love him.</p><p>But was that enough? She wasn\u2019t any blind romantic child. Love didn\u2019t mean a person could live with someone or that the other person was trustworthy. Didn\u2019t guarantee happiness. She knew she couldn\u2019t stay\u2014it wouldn\u2019t work\u2014yet the thought that he wouldn\u2019t be there to hold her in the night, to greet her in the morning with heavy-lidded eyes as he rolled on top of her and pinned her hands over her head...</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d Her heart slowly split into two pieces.</p><p>His eyes closed, and his jaw tightened. \u201cYour mother is here, sumis\u2014Kimberly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed. She\u2019s in the waiting room down the hall.\u201d</p><p>Mom. Kim stared at Raoul, hearing his mother\u2019s words. Thinking of her own. Her mother had loved her father in the beginning\u2014she\u2019d said so\u2014and he\u2019d loved her. But that hadn\u2019t mattered. He\u2019d ground her into the dirt with his demands. Made her a slave.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to be that kind of a person. I\u2019m not like my mother. Aside from sex, she\u2019d never wanted to be subservient to a man. She\u2019d only done it to trap the slavers, not to...to stay. I have a life. \u201cI need to go home.\u201d</p><p>The brown eyes watching her seemed to darken.</p><p>\u201cYes, I think you do,\u201d he said, no doubt in his voice. Dominant. Master.</p><p>Her flare of anger was welcome. She stiffened her spine\u2014look, I still have a spine\u2014 walked over to the bed, and held out her hand. \u201cThank you for...everything.\u201d For the tenderness and firmness, for the understanding and the sex and the...love. She wanted to say more, but her throat closed, preventing words and tears.</p><p>His head bowed as he took her hand, kissed her fingers, and opened his hand. Releasing her. \u201cAdios, gatita.\u201d</p><p>The words echoed over and over as she walked away.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>\u201cAdios, gatita.\u201d No more, Kim told herself. Stop hearing those damned words. Stop feeling abandoned.</p><p>When the hell would she be able to forget about slavers, horrors, and fear?</p><p>And love?</p><p>Damn Master R anyway. He should have pushed her more, done something\u2014anything\u2014 so she could have walked farther than fifteen feet from the door. Fifteen feet wasn\u2019t enough. Kim stood in the doorway of her duplex, staring out at her car. Parked at the curb, as always. So far, far away. Her hands fisted. I can do this, dammit.</p><p>Over the past week or so, she\u2019d managed everything else. Her nightmares were helped by lights staying on\u2014although nothing was as effective as a slow, dark voice and solid body pulling her into his safety. \u201cAdios, gatita.\u201d Drown him.</p><p>Work kept her busy, especially when she got out on the water. Her friends and coworkers had welcomed her back with joy. And worry over what to say, what to avoid. She missed the understanding of Gabi and the other Shadowlands subs.</p><p>But she was getting better, although every single day she ached inside from the loss of...</p><p>She shook her head. That\u2019s in the past. This is now, and the task right now is to reach the car. She\u2019d managed the first few days\u2014and sat in the car shaking afterward\u2014but her fear was getting worse every day.</p><p>She\u2019d better find a place with a garage and an automatic door. Of course a garage wouldn\u2019t rescue her in other locations, but at least she could leave her own house.</p><p>She sniffled a little, trying to steel her nerves. Steel, ha. Her nerves were pretty much frayed twine that snapped under tension, like a couple of nights ago. She\u2019d stood in the door for twenty minutes, trying to go out for groceries. When she\u2019d answered the phone and heard Gabi\u2019s voice, that had done it. Hysteria city. Embarrassing as hell.</p><p>Time to try again. Kim made it three steps and froze at the sight of a van coming closer. It pulled up behind her car. Her skin chilled as she tried not to run into the house. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I hate vans. But it wasn\u2019t black; it was a cheerful pale yellow with hand-painted dogs decorating the sides. Really, no self-respecting kidnapper would drive a vehicle like that. Right?</p><p>The woman driver jumped out and rather than approaching, she opened the back. Unable to master her fear, Kim retreated until she stood in the entrance, ready to slam the door shut.</p><p>The woman called something, and a dog jumped out. Brown with a darker muzzle, pointed ears upright. A big dog. A German shepherd?</p><p>Curiosity greater than nerves, Kim waited.</p> <p>The short gray-haired woman walked up the sidewalk, carrying a thick envelope. \u201cWell, you make it easy. Would you be Miss Kimberly Moore?\u201d</p><p>Fears sliding away, Kim smiled. \u201cI am.\u201d Unable to resist, she knelt and held her hand out to the dog. \u201cAren\u2019t you a pretty boy? Aren\u2019t you sweet?\u201d</p><p>With a low whine, he waited until the woman said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Ari. This is your person.\u201d</p><p>The dog gave a bark and lunged forward, tail wagging, taking all of Kim\u2019s petting and responding with nuzzles and quick swipes of his tongue.</p><p>The older woman sighed. \u201cHe just won\u2019t learn the no-licking rule.\u201d She held out the envelope. \u201cLet\u2019s take a few minutes to go through this before I leave. Of course, you can always call if you have questions.\u201d</p> <p>Kim frowned. \u201cQuestions?\u201d Was this some new religious technique? Use a dog to get the sinners to let you in the door? \u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout Ari\u2014it\u2019s short for Ariel, by the way, after the archangel.\u201d She smiled at the dog\u2019s whine. \u201cI think your friend was correct. You two seem quite suited for each other.\u201d</p><p>Friend. Suited. \u201cI\u2019m not following this. Are you saying you\u2019re leaving the dog\u2014Ari\u2014 here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes.\u201d The woman\u2019s brows drew together. \u201cHe didn\u2019t call you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my.\u201d With a sound of exasperation, the woman held out her hand. \u201cI\u2019m Maggie Jenkins, and I train guard dogs for women. Only for women. A man named Raoul Sandoval called earlier and kept me on the phone for a good hour, making me describe every dog available. And then he bought Ari for you and asked me to deliver him today. He said you, especially, needed one trained to be an escort, a dog to either accompany you into stores or wait outside.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAn escort?\u201d Kim stared at Ari, seeing the large fangs, the strong body, the sheer threat of him. \u201cHe\u2019ll go with me\u2014everywhere? And wait outside if he can\u2019t come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. That\u2019s his job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014for how long do I have him?\u201d God, if she could only keep him a month, long enough to get past her fears.</p><p>\u201cChild, the dog is yours. Mr. Sandoval didn\u2019t hire him. He bought Ari outright, which is good.\u201d Maggie smiled. \u201cAri isn\u2019t happy being hired out. He wants his own person. In fact, I think you\u2019ve bonded, and he\u2019d already be unhappy to leave you.\u201d</p><p>Kim realized the dog was completely in her arms, leaning against her until his top half sprawled over her legs. She gave a laugh, felt him licking the tears from her cheeks, and buried her face in the thick fur.</p><p>Three hundred miles away, and Master R still protected her. How could she not love him?</p><p>Her mother\u2019s kitchen hadn\u2019t changed, Kim thought as she filled the dishwasher from the stacked plates on the counter. Such a cheerful room with white cupboards and ruffled curtains, dark blue countertops, and cows frolicking on the fridge and canisters. Grinning cows. That\u2019s just wrong.</p><p>\u201cSo, this person\u2014man\u2014you were living with...\u201d Kim\u2019s mother plunged a pot into the dishwater.</p> <p>\u201cRaoul.\u201d Saying his name still sent a shiver up her spine. Ari, who\u2019d stationed himself nearby in case of appetizing accidents, whined slightly.</p><p>\u201cYes, that one. He seemed very nice.\u201d</p><p>Startled, Kim glanced over. \u201cWait\u2014you met him? When?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe came into the waiting room a little before you did. Said he wanted to meet me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did he get there? He wasn\u2019t supposed to get out of bed.\u201d Kim stared at a picture on the wall, her as a child, arm in a cast, face tight as she tried not to cry from the pain. The last time she saw Master R, he\u2019d worn the same strained expression. He\u2019d taken her hand in his, kissed her fingers, and now she realized the IV needle had been missing from the back of his hand.</p><p>\u201cThat idiot.\u201d He\u2019d walked down the hall to meet her mom. \u201cGod, no wonder he looked like he hurt.\u201d She wanted to hit him for being so stupid. So damned macho.</p><p>\u201cHe wanted to make sure I\u2019d take care of you. Asked me many questions.\u201d He\u2019d met her mom. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Her mother laughed. \u201cYes. He was very worried about you.\u201d</p><p>Kim smiled at her mother, who looked so much younger these days. They\u2019d celebrated Kim\u2019s return at a day spa, Kim with a manicure and pedicure, and her mother had her hair restored to a light brown. With highlights, no less. Who is this woman, and what have you done with my mom?</p><p>But she knew. Before the kidnapping, her mother had met a man. During the time Kim had been missing, he\u2019d apparently been a rock of comfort. \u201cKind of like how Greg worries about you?\u201d</p><p>Her mother flushed and glanced toward the living room where Greg and one of his younger colleagues were cheering a touchdown. \u201cHe does, doesn\u2019t he? Kim, I\u2019m so happy to have found him. To know that all men aren\u2019t like your father. To be respected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you tell? You\u2019re still cooking. Cleaning. Working.\u201d Kim frowned. \u201cIn fact, we\u2019re in here washing dishes while they watch television. I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s any difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s...even now. Balanced. Inside the house is my area. Outside is his. Remember how he mowed the lawn and trimmed the bushes when you came, so we could girl-talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d Mom and Greg both worked and weren\u2019t living together yet, although that was undoubtedly coming. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen the yard looking so nice.\u201d Or the house in such repair. Nothing squeaked. No paint was scraped. Greg had laughed when she complimented him and said he enjoyed working outside after a day on the computer.</p><p>Her mother dried her hands on the towel. \u201cBut it\u2019s not just the fairness, honey. It\u2019s the way he...appreciates...anything I do. Who I am.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI wonder sometimes if I might have managed to leave your father if my sense of self-worth hadn\u2019t been so ground down. When someone tells you that you\u2019re worthless and stupid and ugly, eventually you start to believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s another kind of abuse,\u201d Kim said. How strange to see her mother as another female, subject to all the problems women had. And to be proud of how she\u2019d grown and moved on.</p><p>\u201cYes, it is. And I\u2019m sorry, baby, you had to see it. I worry that it gave you a warped view of marriage. Of loving.\u201d</p><p>It had. Her mother\u2019d been a slave as much as any woman with a collar around her neck. How strange that a housewife could have fewer rights than a submissive. And Mom had been much, much less cherished. \u201cMaybe a little. I\u2019m still working it out.\u201d</p><p>No need to make Mom feel guiltier though. She bit her lip, thinking to change the subject, and the one topic she didn\u2019t want to talk about\u2014and couldn\u2019t forget\u2014slipped out. \u201cSo what did you think of Raoul?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could I not like a man who would take a knife for my daughter?\u201d Mom sniffed and wiped her eyes. \u201cOr one who sent you home although anyone with a brain in her head would see that it tore him up to let you go.\u201d</p><p>It did? As Kim\u2019s aching for Master R intensified, Ari rose, pushing his muzzle into her hands. She kissed the top of his furry head. \u201cI can\u2019t be with him though. He wants to make all the decisions, to have me serve him\u2014wants a slave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t work outside the home?\u201d</p><p>Kim remembered what he\u2019d said about his former slaves. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a problem. It\u2019s what would happen the rest of the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Her mother shook her head. \u201cThat\u2019s odd to think about, and yet how is that different from being a housewife? A marriage is... Each person serves the other, and from what I saw of your Raoul, he would care for you as much as you cared for him. So perhaps it comes down to who makes the decisions. Do you want him to do that?\u201d</p><p>Kim opened her mouth, prepared to say, Of course not.</p><p>But her mother held up her hand. \u201cIf you really knew the answer, you wouldn\u2019t seem so unhappy. You\u2019re not forging ahead to deal with your choice, because you haven\u2019t made one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t? I thought I had.\u201d</p><p>Her mother shook her head. \u201cYou look lost, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, that\u2019s how I feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink about it until you\u2019re sure, then let it go. Whichever way you choose, I\u2019ll support you.\u201d</p><p>After letting her inner cynic and inner coward battle it out, Kim had phoned Raoul. She\u2019d thank him for Ari and then...talk. But his secretary picked up the call. Master R was overseeing a project in Costa Rica. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So much for that.

Gabi had snapped a shot with her cell, and Kim had cooed over the tiny, scrunched-up face. A baby boy with Master Dan\u2019s dark hair in a fine fuzz. Why do I feel like my life should be there?</p><p>Kim carried her salad to the couch and turned on the television. Not much on, although face it, she mostly wanted the noise.</p> <p>Ari stuck his head in her lap, sniffing the bowl to check out the prospects for tidbits. With a whine of disgust, he lay down at her feet. He loathed salads.</p><p>So did Master R.</p><p>Kim smiled, remembering the lecture she\u2019d gotten: \u201cIf God wanted humans to eat vegetables, he wouldn\u2019t have colored them green. Green things are moldy.\u201d Despite his opinion, he\u2019d always helped her cut up the ingredients and dutifully eaten a portion. She felt wonderful when he ate food she\u2019d prepared, and even more so when she knew it was good for him.</p><p>When she\u2019d teased him that it was her job to keep him healthy, he\u2019d smiled, his expression approving and pleased, although all he\u2019d said was yes.</p><p>Was that how he felt about her? It was his job to keep her healthy? Happy?</p> <p>She liked that. But what about him making the decisions for me? The times when he told her to do something and she didn\u2019t agree. She bit her lip. There had been quite a few instances like that, actually. But she\u2019d complied, because it had mattered enough to him to order it, and...she wanted to give him that pleasure, to receive his smile of approval.</p><p>I am so confused.</p><p>Returning home was supposed to have put her life back on track, but the track seemed to have turned into a rut. Had it been this lonely before? Maybe she should get a roommate. She wiggled her toes in Ari\u2019s fur, and he rolled so she\u2019d rub his side as well. A roommate who could talk. And argue, even if it was about the merits of action movies over chick flicks.</p><p>She\u2019d actually watched a Chuck Norris movie last night. How weird was that?</p><p>\u201cWhat am I going to do, Ari? Should I try to visit Master R while I\u2019m there?\u201d She glanced at the boarding pass on the coffee table. She had a flight to Tampa on Friday. In the hospital, Galen and Vance had warned her she\u2019d be called back, off and on, for some of the legal stuff. Ugh. The thought of talking about her slavery again made her sick. Then again... She smiled. Partly because of her, the buyers and slavers were imprisoned. In cages. Go me.</p><p>What about Master R?</p> <p>\u201cI miss him, you know. I really do love him, and I think he loves me too. Maybe.\u201d She frowned. How many times had she wondered? He\u2019d only said it that once. What if he didn\u2019t mean it?</p><p>She took a bite of her salad, chomping determinedly. \u201cAnd I miss...\u201d She sighed. \u201cBelonging. Maybe that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\u201d She pointed her fork at Ari. \u201cTake you, for example. You know I own you, but you also know that I\u2019m yours. I\u2019m your person, and I take care of you. I feed you and brush you. But you guard me and feel important because you do. Part of it\u2019s serving and giving, and part of it\u2019s belonging, and part of it\u2019s being dominated. I see the pattern, but it\u2019s sure confusing.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d love him as much if he weren\u2019t dominant, because that\u2019s who he is. But just because I like some of his control, do I want it all the time?\u201d</p><p>Dammit, why isn\u2019t there a book with the answers in it?</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>The US District courthouse was intimidating, and the quizzing Kim had gone through hadn\u2019t helped her nerves any. She sat on a bench in the long hallway, trying to make her insides stop shaking as she waited for Vance to return. She\u2019d done her duty, given her information. With Lord Greville dead and the Overseer cooperating, she was mostly filling in the gaps.</p><p>She\u2019d been able to identify the photo of the man who\u2019d tried to buy her before Lord Greville had, and the two buyers at the sale house. The one who\u2019d taken Holly. Her heart twisted. Beaten to death.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a pretty girl.\u201d The rough voice brought her head up, and she checked the hall. Sam.</p> <p>And Master R.</p><p>Every tiny cell in her body yearned toward him so violently it was a wonder she didn\u2019t fly down the hall.</p><p>He just looked at her with his dark eyes. He looked tired\u2014deep lines beside his mouth, his color almost muddy.</p><p>Are you all right? she wanted to ask but didn\u2019t. \u201cHi guys,\u201d she managed. \u201cAre you here for FBI stuff too?\u201d</p><p>Master R didn\u2019t speak.</p><p>Sam frowned and then nodded his head. \u201cThe place is filled with witnesses. But we\u2019re done now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, me too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we take you somewhere?\u201d Master R asked finally, and the wonderful sound of his rich baritone had her eyes filling with tears.</p><p>Behind the men, the door opened. Two uniformed police walked out, escorting...the Overseer. His tone, sharp and oily, struck her like a blow, the unexpected sound making her guts twist. He wore patches over his eyes, and the memory of her thumbs, the squishing\u2014his scream...</p><p>Her stomach turned over. Gagging, she ran for the bathroom down the hall.</p><p>Raoul watched her flee and closed his eyes, despair washing over him. To have her run from him...</p><p>His heart had stopped when he\u2019d seen her sitting on a bench near the end of the tiled hall. He\u2019d given a bitter laugh and started to turn away\u2014every dark-haired woman made him think of her\u2014but it really was her. His Kimberly. He\u2019d headed straight for her, leaving his brains\u2014and Sam\u2014behind him.</p><p>Sam had caught up after a step, seen where Raoul was looking, and given a grunt of...satisfaction?</p><p>The distance had seemed interminable, almost as long as the preceding weeks. When he\u2019d been released from the hospital, he\u2019d returned to a house as empty and cold as if in the far north. He tried watching the waves, searching for the solace she\u2019d always received from her time on the beach. All he found were memories of her hair streaming back in the wind, her little toes wrinkled from walking barefoot in the surf, her skin smelling of salt air as if he\u2019d caught a mermaid.</p><p>He abandoned the shore after a couple of days, the tower room soon after. The dungeon he couldn\u2019t face at all. The kitchen had echoed with her laughter and the memories of sharing meals, her kneeling at his feet to take food from his fingers, pulling her into his lap to get her closer.</p><p>He started avoiding his kitchen as well.</p><p>When Z and Cullen had showed up unexpectedly and discovered that he\u2019d forgotten to eat that day, Z had been...blunt.</p><p>Raoul had flown to a job site in Costa Rica, returning only a couple of days ago. He was doing better. He could get past this and move on.</p><p>He frowned at the restroom door. She didn\u2019t look healthy, with dark circles under her eyes and gaunt cheeks. And when they\u2019d seen her, she\u2019d had her arms around her knees, holding herself in a tight ball. She must have talked to the Feds. He hadn\u2019t been there to hold her, to give her a feeling of safety. Anger sparked in him, that Kouros hadn\u2019t told him that she\u2019d be coming.</p><p>If she\u2019d wanted him to know she was in Tampa, she knew his phone number.</p><p>And seeing him nauseated her. His body felt like a lead robot as he turned to Sam. \u201cI\u2019d better go before she comes back out.\u201d</p><p>Sam said a foul word, then nodded reluctantly. \u201cMaybe so. Is tomorrow still on?\u201d</p><p>Raoul hesitated, then nodded. He couldn\u2019t cancel the party without hurting little Kari\u2019s feelings. That would be unworthy of a man. \u201cS\u00ed.\u201d</p><p>On Sunday, he\u2019d return to Costa Rica.</p><p>Sam watched his friend bow his head and walk away. Tenderhearted bastard. The girl\u2019s reaction had ripped his guts right out. After all Raoul had suffered, he didn\u2019t deserve that crap. What the hell was she thinking?</p><p>He stalked over to the women\u2019s restroom, shoved the door open, and walked in. A woman stood at the sink, decorating her face\u2014and doing a lousy job of it. \u201cOut,\u201d Sam snapped.</p><p>With a squeak, she fled, leaving her lipstick behind. Sam shook his head. Coward. He had</p><p>a feeling his redheaded Linda wouldn\u2019t have run. The thought only made him more furious. She had run, in a way. No call. He\u2019d asked Galen about her and seen the answer in the agent\u2019s face. She\u2019d requested no contact from him.</p><p>Fine.</p><p>The sound of jagged breathing came from the end stall, and Sam pushed the unlatched door open. One little subbie, on her knees, half in tears. Served her right. Trying to ignore the welling of pity, Sam wet a few paper towels. \u201cWipe your face.\u201d</p><p>She jerked at the sound of his voice and obeyed, tried to stand, and failed.</p><p>Sam took her arm and yanked her to her feet. Not politely. \u201cClean up, and I\u2019ll see you in the hallway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said. Her voice was hoarse, and she was muddy white.</p><p>He frowned as he stepped into the hall. Odd she\u2019d react so violently to Raoul when she\u2019d worried so much about him after he\u2019d been knifed. Had something ugly happened in the hospital? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Unfortunately, she was in no shape to get back to wherever she was staying. Why the hell was she here by herself anyway?</p><p>That was his first question when she came out.</p><p>\u201cGabi has appointments,\u201d she answered, looking up and down the hall. \u201cMarcus was in court. They wanted Jessica or one of the others to come with me, but I thought I\u2019d be all right.\u201d She straightened her shoulders. \u201cVance is planning to return and escort me out. I\u2019m fine now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you are, girl.\u201d He flipped open his phone, called the FBI agent, said, \u201cI\u2019m taking Kim home,\u201d and shut it without waiting for an answer. He took her arm, ignored her trembling, and led her out to the parking lot. She tried to pull away at the taxi stop, and he gave her a stare that stopped her right fast. There were benefits to escorting submissives.</p><p>Once he got her in his truck and was safely on the freeway, he asked her the question that had been bothering him. \u201cDid something happen the last time you saw Raoul?\u201d</p><p>She looked up from her hands, her brows together. \u201cN-no. He handed me over to my mom and said good-bye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what the hell happened that the sight of him makes you upchuck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sight...? You think I was sick because of Master R?\u201d She stared at him.</p><p>Was the man insane? Kim\u2019s hand curled around the strap of the seatbelt as she frowned at him. How could he think...?</p><p>Maybe they hadn\u2019t seen the people leaving the courtroom behind them. Probably hadn\u2019t even heard that oily voice\u2014it wasn\u2019t as if they\u2019d painfully learned to pay attention to every nuance in it. \u201cThe Overseer came out of a room behind you. He spoke.\u201d She shuddered, and her stomach roiled queasily. \u201cI saw him.\u201d Bandages...because his eyes... She tried to swallow.</p><p>\u201cHell no. Take a breath, girl.\u201d Sam flipped the air-conditioning to high. \u201cYou puke in my truck, and I\u2019ll wallop your hide, no matter what Raoul says.\u201d</p><p>The air\u2014and the snap in his voice\u2014wiped away the memories and settled her stomach. Her hands unclenched. Then her brain kicked in. \u201cYou thought seeing Master R made me sick? God, Sam, did he think that too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou planning to see him while you\u2019re here?\u201d Sam asked, his fingers tapping impatiently on the wheel as the traffic slowed, horns blaring.</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d She sighed. Her flight out on Saturday had been a compromise. Rather than leaving today, she\u2019d left herself time to call him this evening...if she decided to. \u201cI\u2019ve changed my mind so many times I\u2019m dizzy. I want to see him so...so...\u201d So badly that her insides went all quivery at the thought. \u201cThen I remember he wants a-a\u201d\u2014not a slave, he\u2019d said\u2014\u201ca full-time submissive. Not me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t like serving him?\u201d Sam asked easily, as if his question was no more important than asking if she liked Chinese food.</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d Yes. \u201cDammit, no. I was pretending.\u201d I\u2019m a bedroom submissive. No more. She stared out the window at the cars in the next lane. Old man\u2014probably retired here. A married couple with young children\u2014vacationers.</p><p>\u201cPretty good pretense, subbie,\u201d he said, his voice level. \u201cYou looked contented as a cat in cream sitting at his feet.\u201d</p><p>The stab slashed painfully, and she scowled. \u201cWell, I lo\u2014like him. A lot. That doesn\u2019t mean I want to...to slave for him.\u201d</p><p>Sam snorted. \u201cMissy, when I pick a woman to scene with, I don\u2019t choose a lightweight who enjoys a widdle spanking. I pick a masochist who wants what I can give her. I look for someone whose need for pain matches my need to give it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, girl.\u201d He switched to the fast lane to get around a slow semi and returned to the middle lane. \u201cA master like Raoul looks for a woman whose need to serve and submit matches his need to protect and take command. It\u2019s a balancing act, missy, and in the best relationships, the master is as involved as the submissive. If you hadn\u2019t loved being at his feet, neither one of you would have looked happy.\u201d</p> <p>Had Master R been content?</p><p>\u201cSo you ask yourself this: being under Raoul\u2019s command and serving him, did it fill a need inside you? Make you feel whole when you might have not even realized something was lacking until then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I say you could speak?\u201d The chill in his voice kept her silent, and in silence, he finished the drive, then escorted her to Marcus\u2019s house.</p><p>Marcus let her in. \u201cSam, what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMet her at the courthouse.\u201d His light blue gaze pinned her in place. \u201cDo yourself some thinking, girl. And you call Raoul and explain why you ran, or I\u2019ll beat your ass myself.\u201d He gave her another hard look and stalked away.</p><p>After refusing to join Marcus and Gabi for supper, Kimberly did what Sam had ordered. At least the thinking part.</p><p>God, she\u2019d loved seeing Master R. Had wanted to throw herself in his arms. Damn the Overseer for messing everything up. Master R might have hugged her, held her, kissed her. She sighed. But would that have answered her questions?</p><p>Kim scrunched down farther on the patio chair and watched the giant inflated swan drift aimlessly in the pool, batted by the tiny breeze. Just like me, she decided. Unable to make a decision at all.</p><p>She sighed and started thinking, trying to discard the past bullshit and her preconceived notions of how the world should be. I love Master R. That was a given.</p><p>Did she want to live with him? God, yes.</p><p>Did she want him in charge? Because he would be. He couldn\u2019t help it. And okay, she liked it. Mostly. No matter how much she\u2019d told herself otherwise, when she\u2019d asked him to be her master again, it hadn\u2019t been totally because of the slavers and her recovery. She wanted him in charge more than just in the bedroom. The acknowledgement made her wince. How much more?</p><p>Would he try to make her into something she didn\u2019t want to be?</p><p>Do I trust him?</p><p>How could she not? Like her mom said, he\u2019d taken a knife for her. But risking your life to save a person was very different from being in command over them in all the day-to-day stuff. She put her feet on the chair and laid her head on her knees.</p><p>The memory of his family\u2019s accusations was like sand in her shoes. She could walk, but it abraded her nerves. She didn\u2019t believe them, yet she needed to find out what had happened with Master R\u2019s wife before she could resolve any of the other questions.</p><p>Her plane left tomorrow morning.</p><p>She returned to the living room where Gabi was playing with her cats, Hamlet and Horatio. \u201cWhere\u2019s Marcus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had to run back to his office for something. Did you finish your thinking about Raoul?\u201d</p><p>Kim gave her a rueful smile. There was nothing like a girlfriend to know what was going on without explanations. \u201cMostly. But I need some help. I met Raoul\u2019s family in the hospital. He\u2019d told me his family doesn\u2019t talk to him because of his lifestyle, but they said he was abusing his ex-wife. I... It\u2019s been bothering me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, I bet. But Raoul? Abuse someone. No way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I told them. But, Gabi, I need to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. I get that.\u201d Gabi tossed the fuzzy mouse, and the two cats gave chase. \u201cHe was already divorced before I met him. Before Marcus and Jessica too. But I bet Jessica can tell us who to ask.\u201d</p><p>One phone call and a nice drive later, they met Jessica at the door of the Shadowlands. Despite her nerves, Kim laughed at the look on the guard\u2019s face when he saw them. Ben didn\u2019t approve of their casual shorts and T-shirts and had made them remove their sandals and sneakers. He also carefully explained that Z, Marcus, and Master Raoul weren\u2019t present...as if the knowledge would give them second thoughts. Not.</p><p>This early on a Friday night, the Shadowlands was just revving up, and only a few stations were occupied. Cullen manned the bar, his back to them, and from the way Gabi and Jessica headed for the nearest, darkest sitting area, Kim started to worry. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to get in trouble, are you?\u201d</p><p>The two exchanged glances and snickered. Jessica said, \u201cI\u2019m not allowed to be here without Z. Ever. If he sees us, Master Tattletale Cullen will be sure to tell him\u2014if he doesn\u2019t toss me out all by himself.\u201d</p><p>Gabi gave Kim a rueful grin. \u201cSame here. Marcus\u2019ll throw a fit. See how much I love you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God, I\u2019m sorry. Just point the trainee out and leave before anyone sees you. I can\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jessica shook her head no. \u201cSally doesn\u2019t know you. She might be gossip girl, but she\u2019s really discreet who she shares with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKim, we love our doms, but there\u2019s times when a girl\u2019s got to do what a girl\u2019s got to do.\u201d Gabi grinned at Jessica. \u201cBesides, we\u2019ve been so angelic lately, we\u2019re in danger of losing our official \u2018brat\u2019 status.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t have that,\u201d Jessica agreed. \u201cAnd there\u2019s our target.\u201d She pointed to the food tables and waved, catching the eye of a pretty brunette who grinned and headed over.</p><p>She had an energy that reminded Kim of a child, all enthusiasm, no worries about dignity. Then Kim frowned. Wasn\u2019t this the submissive who that nasty dom had slapped? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey, guys.\u201d The brunette glanced around. \u201cWhere\u2019re your masters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to know,\u201d Jessica said firmly. \u201cSally, this is Kim, who is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaster Raoul\u2019s submissive.\u201d Sally\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cI didn\u2019t see your fireplay scene, but I saw you together afterward. God, he really dotes on you, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d Her envy was obvious and heartening.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d Kim sighed. \u201cMaybe. But I have a question about his past. Can you help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. If Jessica says it\u2019s okay, then I figure it\u2019s okay.\u201d Sally nodded to a group of chairs by the munchie tables. \u201cSit and I\u2019ll get provisions. Gossip is hungry work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s so cute,\u201d Kim whispered to Jessica as they sat down, and Gabi headed for the bottled water. \u201cI can\u2019t believe she doesn\u2019t have a dom of her own.\u201d</p><p>Jessica grinned. \u201cShe\u2019s totally sweet and fun, but during a scene, usually some poor sucker of a dom finds out she\u2019s also incredibly smart. She\u2019s had a couple of relationships, but she can\u2019t give up control unless a guy is sharper and stronger than she is.\u201d</p><p>Gabi set down bottles of water, giving the bar a wistful look. \u201cI sure could use a drink.\u201d</p><p>Sally brought over a plate of tiny egg rolls and another of minipizzas, then dropped into a chair. \u201cOkay, what information do you need?\u201d</p><p>Kim hesitated. This felt like a betrayal, poking into Master R\u2019s business, but\u2014</p><p>\u201cRaoul\u2019s ex,\u201d Gabi said firmly, winking at Kim. \u201cSomething ugly happened with her, and Kim needs to find out what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOooh,\u201d Sally waved her hand in the air. \u201cPick me, teacher. I know the answer.\u201d</p><p>Jessica and Gabi laughed.</p><p>Oh God, there really was something. Kim\u2019s stomach clenched.</p><p>Sally sobered and said slowly, \u201cThere\u2019s like two parts to this, and I shouldn\u2019t know this first part, right? But it\u2019s not like I snooped or anything. See, Master Raoul had just filed for divorce, and he was here real late with Master Dan, and they\u2019d both been drinking more than normal.\u201d She grimaced. \u201cUm, I\u2019d rather they not find out I spilled. I got the impression Dan\u2019s the only person who knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t tell him,\u201d Kim promised firmly.</p><p>\u201cDan drinks?\u201d Jessica asked.</p><p>\u201cHe stopped a while back.\u201d Sally munched down an egg roll. \u201cIt boils down to this: Master Raoul came home, went into his dungeon, and found his wife screwing her sister\u2019s husband. Very willingly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Gabi said. \u201cPoor Raoul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Sally opened a bottle of water. \u201cIt gets worse. The bro-in-law had whipped the hell out of her first.\u201d</p><p>Kim frowned. \u201cShe made love to the guy after he hurt her? That doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it does. See, she was a serious pain slut\u2014even kinda warped about it, you know? Into scars and blood, anything. I\u2019m not sure she even had limits, but Raoul\u2014well, you know him\u2014 he\u2019s got a line he doesn\u2019t cross. He\u2019d deal out bruises and welts and stuff, but not permanent damage. They were definitely mismatched.\u201d</p><p>Alicia\u2019s injuries hadn\u2019t come from Raoul? Kim frowned.</p> <p>\u201cGod, this is good gossip,\u201d Jessica said. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s horrible of us to share, but...\u201d She wiggled. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo there I was, carrying over their drinks with Raoul talking about it. Just totally wrecked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, that must have hurt him bad.\u201d Kim felt the ache deep in her bones. Master R was so careful of everyone and so insistent on honesty. To have his wife cheat on him\u2014and in his home. \u201cBut didn\u2019t he have a clue? He always knows if I\u2019m lying.\u201d</p><p>Jessica wrapped an arm around Kim and squeezed gently. \u201cEven the Shadowlands Masters are only human\u2014although it\u2019s not easy to remember sometimes. When they\u2019re in dom mode, they\u2019re really, really perceptive, but they can\u2019t stay that way all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could see their marriage had problems. Raoul, he\u2019s so honorable, he wouldn\u2019t give up, but Alicia\u2014\u201d Sally shrugged. \u201cShe was nice enough, and everybody liked her, and she had this great sarcastic sense of humor, but she was...hmm...maybe not all that honest.\u201d</p><p>Adultery wasn\u2019t exactly honest, no. But why had Alicia gone to Master R\u2019s family with that bullshit story? It wasn\u2019t like he\u2019d been the one screwing around on her. \u201cSo she divorced Master R, and they went their separate ways? I heard...\u201d How could she put this? \u201cI heard she said some stuff about him.\u201d</p><p>Sally popped an egg roll in her mouth, holding up her hand for them to wait. \u201cOkay, this is the second part of the story. I got it from Vanessa, who got it from Alicia since they were BFFs back then. And it\u2019s not a big secret. See, Alicia demanded a prenup \u2019cause Master Raoul had just started his company not long before, and she was making the big bucks. She didn\u2019t want to share, you know?\u201d</p><p>The woman sounded like a cast-iron bitch, Kim decided.</p><p>\u201cWhat a loser,\u201d Gabi muttered.</p><p>Sally continued, \u201cBut then Raoul\u2019s company takes off, and he\u2019s mad at her cheating, and he sticks to the prenup\u2014yours is yours and mine is mine. Even worse, he filed for divorce the day after he found them. So she goes ballistic, saying he\u2019d screwed her over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly she was the one doing the screwing.\u201d Gabi shook her head. \u201cPoor Raoul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. She came here after she\u2019d gotten the papers and was screaming her head off in the dressing rooms. She stripped to show off all the damage\u2014and the bro-in-law had really messed her up. But she was saying Raoul did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d Gabi said. \u201cI bet people believed her too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for long.\u201d Sally grinned. \u201cThis was before Raoul was a master, so Z hadn\u2019t a clue about what had really happened, but you know how Z is. Superpsychologist-plus and a layer of dom on top?\u201d</p><p>Jessica snickered. \u201cThat\u2019s him, all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway, he, like, stalks into the women\u2019s room\u2014and really flusters some naked women too\u2014and Alicia has her back to him. He listens to the bullshit.\u201d</p><p>Kim realized she was holding her breath. \u201cWere you there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, all us trainees were getting dressed.\u201d Sally gave a mock shiver. \u201cZ was\u2014God, he listened, and his face got that really pissed-off, cold expression of his, the one that can shrivel everything up inside you? And he says right to her face that she\u2019s lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOooh,\u201d Jessica said. \u201cZ never makes a mistake about liars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Gabi grabbed Kim\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t even try to deny it. Not to Master Z.\u201d Sally waggled her water bottle. \u201cHe told her she had one minute to put her clothes on. Then he booted her out and canceled her membership.\u201d</p><p>That explained why Master R\u2019s ex had been out for revenge. But what about the other part? That he hadn\u2019t let her leave. \u201cAnd was she his s-slave?\u201d</p><p>Gabi said, \u201cKim\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to know.\u201d</p><p>Jessica frowned. \u201cHe and Z and I were talking one night. Z\u2019d swatted my butt for being impertinent, and he told Raoul about how we\u2019d started off keeping the D/s stuff to scenes and bedrooms, but how it had edged out into our lifestyle.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cIt really has. Knowing Z might pick up the reins at any minute means it\u2019s always simmering under the surface\u2014and I love it.\u201d</p><p>Sally gave an audible sigh.</p><p>Jessica grinned at her. \u201cAnyway, Raoul said his went the other way. He and Alicia started off in a Master/slave relationship, but it had died away.\u201d She bit her lip. \u201cHe looked, I don\u2019t know, empty.\u201d</p><p>Kim could feel the ache in her chest. \u201cSo\u2014why start and then stop?\u201d</p><p>Sally shook her head and said slowly, \u201cI think new love makes you crazy, and if you\u2019re new to BDSM, maybe it\u2019s difficult to tell what\u2019s what. But if you don\u2019t have that need to serve or submit, then a power exchange won\u2019t work very long. On the other end, there\u2019s solid M/s and D/s relationships where the people aren\u2019t in love, but they\u2019re both fulfilled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s pretty convoluted, but I almost understand what you\u2019re saying,\u201d Gabi said.</p><p>Sally grinned. \u201cAnyway, Alicia wasn\u2019t into service or even submission. Straight-shot masochist. And it was obvious. But it was hard on Master Raoul. He\u2019s dominant right down to his bones.\u201d</p><p>Could I keep Master R happy? Kim frowned. Do I want to serve him just because I love him? Oh, wonderful. More questions. But for right now... \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little after nine. Why?\u201d Jessica asked.</p><p>\u201cI have a visit to make.\u201d She rummaged in her purse and pulled out the note she\u2019d made earlier. It was downright scary how easy it was to use the Internet to get a person\u2019s address.</p><p>She started to ask Gabi to lend her the car, then rethought. Panicking on someone\u2019s doorstep wouldn\u2019t be smart\u2014she should have brought her escort dog. \u201cGabi, can you come with me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>Her plane would be leaving right about now. Raoul frowned at the design for a cable bridge on his computer and shut the program down. If he continued in this half-assed fashion, he\u2019d end up redoing all the work. He leaned back in his chair and stared at the ceiling.</p><p>Time to get your life in order, Sandoval . Truly, he should be grateful for yesterday, for seeing how she reacted to him. His last doubt had been resolved, and he no longer had to argue with himself whether he wanted her to return. He rubbed his cheek, scowling at the scratchiness. Forgot to shave again. He needed to clean up before the party.</p><p>If she showed up and dropped to her knees and begged him to make her his slave, he wouldn\u2019t agree. He closed his eyes and hauled in a painful breath. No. Over the past weeks, he\u2019d realized he couldn\u2019t take that step. Not now. Especially not with a woman who\u2019d steal his heart, his life, and then decide she\u2019d made a mistake.</p><p>He glanced around the house he\u2019d built in an attempt to eradicate his wife from his memories.</p><p>Now Kimberly\u2019s presence infused it instead. So many memories just from the few weeks they\u2019d been together, and even though he\u2019d known she\u2019d leave.</p><p>How much worse would it be if they tried to build a future together? And then she\u2019d tell him she didn\u2019t want a master, didn\u2019t want to serve him\u2014or love him either. Would he have to build a new house again?</p><p>He tried to laugh, but it sounded more like a response to a gut shot. His love for Alicia bore no resemblance to the overwhelming way he felt about Kimberly. She was warmth and laughter and hopes he should never have harbored.</p><p>If he really thought she\u2019d stay with him, accept him, that might be different. If he\u2019d met her before her slavery, maybe...maybe he would have risked trying to teach her about her own needs.</p><p>She was brave, so very resilient, but that would ask too much.</p><p>He\u2019d tried living a vanilla life. He couldn\u2019t do it again. He\u2019d unconsciously take the control from a little sub, and she would resent it. And leave him.</p><p>No. Maybe in a few years, he\u2019d be willing to open himself up to the potential for pain. Kimberly would have married some nice normal man, probably have some children by then. The thought stabbed into his heart like a rapier.</p><p>He swallowed and forced a smile. He would wish her well.</p><p>Mouth tight, he sat back down at his computer and brought up the program. He\u2019d work. Period.</p><p>An hour later, the sound of the doorbell ran through Raoul\u2019s empty house. He glanced at the clock\u2014only ten in the morning. The party for Kari and Dan didn\u2019t start until one, and the caterers had already arrived and filled the fridge. Who would this be? Kimberly? The momentary hope lit his heart and died as quickly. Long gone.</p><p>He saved his design and headed for the front, actually a bit pleased at the interruption. Anything was better than the hollow feeling of his home. Pitiful, Sandoval. But he\u2019d be happy to leave again.</p><p>He pulled open the door, assuming he\u2019d be buying some Girl Scout cookies or a magazine subscription he didn\u2019t need. The neighborhood children had him figured for a soft touch. But no child waited in the entry.</p><p>He stared for a second before his voice would work. \u201cMam\u00e1?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMijo.\u201d His mother had tears in her eyes. Lucia stood a pace behind, openly crying.</p><p>Had one of his nephews been hurt? Raoul took his mother\u2019s frail hands. \u201cMam\u00e1, what has happened? What is wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaoul, I was so cruel. I didn\u2019t know.\u201d His mother wrapped her arms around him, weeping as if her heart were breaking.</p><p>\u201cPlease, please, don\u2019t cry. Whatever is wrong, I will fix it.\u201d</p><p>A second later, his sister attached herself like a burr to his side.</p> <p>Carajo, this looked bad. \u201cHas something happened to the boys?\u201d More sobbing. He clamped a hand on his sister\u2019s arm and gave it a shake. \u201cLucia, talk to me.\u201d</p><p>His sister gave a shuddering laugh and wiped her face, then rubbed her mother\u2019s back. \u201cShhh, Mam\u00e1, we\u2019re scaring him.\u201d</p><p>Raoul growled. \u201cLucia, you will tell me what is wrong. Now.\u201d</p><p>They exchanged glances and smiled. Smiled?</p><p>\u201cDominant, yes, you are surely that,\u201d his mother said. \u201cYou sound like your pap\u00e1 did.\u201d</p><p>He winced and tried to step back. \u201cI just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Mano, we found last night that your wife lied to us that day. The day you filed for divorce,\u201d Lucia said. Her voice turned icy. \u201cAlicia said you whipped her until she bled, that you hit her over and over. You forced her to be a slave and gave her to other men. She said she had to run to get away from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t believe her.\u201d His mother wiped her face with the tiny handkerchief she always tucked under her belt. \u201cBut she showed us horrible bloody marks and bruises everywhere.\u201d</p><p>Raoul stared at them. \u201cBut... I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t.\u201d Lucia\u2019s eyes flashed black with anger. \u201cBut when Mam\u00e1 asked you if you ever hit Alicia and if you ever had put a collar on her, you said yes.\u201d She held her hand up to stop him from speaking. \u201cYou thought we were talking about how you lived. Raoul, we thought you were admitting to beating her and forcing her to be a slave.\u201d</p><p>Someone had jammed a lead pipe into his chest. Pain with every pulse. \u201cAll these years, and you thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMijo, I am sorry,\u201d his mam\u00e1 whispered. \u201cI should have known you would never do such a thing. Only you said you had. But you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen\u2014\u201d Why didn\u2019t his brain work? \u201cHow did you find out\u2014\u201d</p><p>Both women smiled at him, and Lucia said sweetly, \u201cIt\u2019s not important, \u2019mano.\u201d</p><p>The hell it wasn\u2019t. His mouth tightened. He\u2019d find out, damned if he wouldn\u2019t. But for now... \u201cCome in, Mam\u00e1. Lucia. I have coffee made.\u201d As they walked inside, his heart swelled. His family was in his home.</p><p>\u201cRaoul, this is beautiful,\u201d his mother said as she walked through the great room, and his throat tightened when he saw his mother\u2019s eyes. Love. Pride. How long since she\u2019d looked at him that way? \u201cWe will not stay long, but...we couldn\u2019t wait any longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t let her call. I wasn\u2019t sure you\u2019d talk to us,\u201d Lucia admitted. \u201cI\u2019ve been horrible to you.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, remembering the marks on Alicia\u2019s body. He pulled cups from the cupboard and set them on the island. \u201cYou thought I\u2019d abused her. I would have reacted the same way.\u201d</p><p>The time passed quickly as they sat in the kitchen, eating cookies and drinking coffee and catching up.</p><p>Too soon for his taste, Lucia stood, saying, \u201cThe boys will be home soon.\u201d She gave him the mischievous smile he remembered from childhood and hadn\u2019t seen in three long years. \u201cBut we expect to see you for Sunday dinner tomorrow. I have a feeling Mam\u00e1 will fix all your favorites.\u201d</p><p>His mother looked up at him, and his heart caught at the pleading look in her eyes. Begging forgiveness.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019ll be there,\u201d he said gently and kissed his mother\u2019s cheek. He walked them to their car and helped his mother in.</p><p>\u201cRaoul.\u201d His sister waited beside the driver\u2019s door. Pleased, he walked around to give her a final hug.</p><p>She returned it, then took an unhappy breath, one that made him tense. \u201cOne more unpleasantness; then we\u2019ll put it behind us. This morning, I called Alicia\u2019s sister. Penny\u2019s been divorced for a while, ever since she found out Randolph was cheating on her.\u201d Her mouth thinned. \u201cShe hadn\u2019t known that the other woman was her own sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you hear that?\u201d Raoul\u2019s fingers clamped on her shoulders. Somehow they had the whole story\u2014all of it. And to call Penny. \u201cLucia, that wasn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it was necessary. I know you protect women, mi hermano. But, speaking as a woman, there are certain things I would want to know. A man\u2019s cheating is...\u201d She shrugged, having survived her own divorce. \u201cBut such a betrayal from a sister? There is no excuse under heaven. Alicia will find her family\u2014and friends\u2014to be less welcoming, I think.\u201d Lucia patted his cheek. She\u2019d worn the same smug smile after he\u2019d used her Barbie dolls in his war games and she\u2019d turned his prized comic books into cat litter in revenge. A firm believer in retribution was Lucia.</p><p>She added, \u201cI felt much better after the call.\u201d Another kiss on the cheek, and his sister slid into the car.</p><p>Women could be much crueler than men. Smiling a little, Raoul watched the sedan move down his long driveway. As he walked back into his house, his brows drew together. But he still wanted to know\u2014how had they found out all the details of his divorce?</p><p>By one thirty that afternoon, the doorbell in Raoul\u2019s house rang incessantly as people arrived for the barbecue. He shook his head, still amazed at how easily Z had manipulated him.</p><p>Everyone had wanted to celebrate Dan and Kari\u2019s new baby. In many ways, it felt like the first for the Shadowlands Masters, even if some had children from previous marriages. Marcus and Gabi would have given the party, but Gabi wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d be in town. Cullen\u2019s home wasn\u2019t large enough. Sam\u2019s house was isolated in the country. Neither of the dommes could host the party. Z liked to entertain, but this time, he\u2019d given an excuse and said Raoul had the space, a big patio and the beach, and was convenient to everyone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Yes, the cabr\u00f3n had set him up.</p><p>At least Jessica and her friends had taken over answering the door. Raoul concentrated on the barbecue, needing to stay occupied. Although his family\u2019s visit had lightened his heart, the sight of so many couples in the lifestyle rubbed his nose in the fact that he had no one.</p><p>Mistress Anne walked out on the patio, her favorite submissive trailing behind her. She patted the pretty young man\u2019s face. \u201cJoey, look lively and help the others set up the tables.\u201d</p><p>The redhead gave his mistress a meltingly sweet smile and moved stiffly toward the kitchen. Considering Anne\u2019s sadistic streak, she\u2019d probably shoved an overly large anal plug up the poor sub\u2019s ass. Oddly enough, Jessica was moving in the same fashion. What had the little blonde done to get herself in trouble with Z this time?</p><p>The subs trotted back and forth, carrying platters, covering the long patio tables with food. A hum of conversation came from the guests sitting on the patio, splashing and squeals from those in the pool. Some had taken the chance to walk on the beach and enjoy the bright afternoon sun.</p><p>Sam walked over with a cold beer. Raoul took a small drink before putting the bottle down. The way he felt, the alcohol looked too appealing, and he didn\u2019t drink for escape.</p><p>\u201cI took her home,\u201d Sam said, as if continuing a conversation.</p><p>\u201cI know. Thank you for caring for her.\u201d Hoping Sam wouldn\u2019t continue, Raoul turned the chicken, the scent of the sizzling meat filling the air.</p><p>\u201cShe call you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell. She was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI checked with Marcus yesterday to make sure she\u2019d gotten home.\u201d And heard about her flight time. He glanced at his watch. Her plane would have left a while back. Gone. That was good. It was good.</p><p>\u201cYou going to let her just go?\u201d Sam asked, his gaze on the ocean. \u201cAfter what she\u2019s been through, you figure she won\u2019t get over it?\u201d</p><p>Raoul sighed and shut the grill top. After wiping his hands, he picked up his beer again. \u201cAt one time, I thought she might be willing to try. But it is better this way. She\u2019s been hurt, and to be with me in...in the type of relationship I want is more than she could take.\u201d More uncertainty than I\u2019m willing to risk. When had he turned so cautious?</p><p>\u201cPretty much the conclusion I\u2019d come to,\u201d Sam muttered, and Raoul decided he wasn\u2019t talking about Kimberly but about Linda. Sam had kept the redheaded slave safe, as Kimberly had asked, but apparently something else had happened.</p><p>Not that Sam would confide in Raoul. A man wouldn\u2019t...not unless drunk. He winced. The last time he\u2019d drunk that much was three years ago, after Alicia\u2019s betrayal.</p><p>\u201cYou know, about Kim,\u201d Sam started. \u201cAt the courthouse, she didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d His voice was drowned out by the arrival of the Shadowlands trainees, all dressed in civilian clothing. Sam turned away at a hail from Cullen.</p><p>Raoul almost didn\u2019t recognize the trainees: Uzuri in a pale yellow halter-top and shorts that accented her dark chocolate skin and with her kinky hair in dreadlocks. Dara\u2019s blonde spiked hair was tinted purple. In a pink sundress, Maxie looked cheerful and sweet.</p><p>Pretty Sally brought up the rear, in short shorts and three tank tops layered in the odd female way. After exchanging greetings with the milling submissive group, she leaned over to Jessica and whispered something, receiving a smile and a big hug in return.</p><p>Both women turned to look at him...and saw him watching them. Color rose in Sally\u2019s cheeks, and she shifted so her back was toward him.</p><p>Raoul took a sip of his beer, his interest aroused at the un-Sallylike behavior. No greeting. No hug. Was something wrong?</p><p>When Sally said something, Jessica glanced at him and met his eyes. She whispered to Sally, and the trainee\u2019s spine grew stiffer.</p><p>Raoul\u2019s suspicions started to rise. He hadn\u2019t lived with slaves and submissives without learning a few things\u2014like the ability to detect body language that sang of a guilty conscience.</p> <p>None of the other doms received the darting looks. So whatever they\u2019d done had something to do with him. And Kimberly? No. She\u2019d been home with Gabi yesterday evening. As a trainee, Sally would have been at the Shadowlands last night. His eyes narrowed.</p><p>Sally was a bubbly, talkative little submissive who\u2019d been part of the club for maybe five years. None of the other trainees had been around as long. Raoul rubbed his chin. Ever since his mam\u00e1 and sister\u2019s visit this morning, he\u2019d wondered how they\u2019d learned about Alicia\u2019s betrayal. The only person he\u2019d told had been Dan, and his friend never revealed a confidence.</p><p>But no one paid attention to the submissives in the club. They\u2019d been trained to be invisible. Perhaps too invisible. Could she have overheard something when he\u2019d been talking with Dan?</p><p>Sally peeked over her shoulder, saw him watching her, and jerked back around.</p><p>Hmm. Not looking away, he drank his beer.</p><p>\u201cSandoval, how are you doing?\u201d Vance Buchanan walked out the door onto the patio, Kouros beside him. \u201cWho\u2019re you staring at?\u201d</p><p>Raoul nodded toward the group of submissives. \u201cThe little brunette.\u201d</p><p>The two FBI agents turned. Sally darted a look at Raoul and saw all three men looking at her. The color flared in her cheeks. She edged closer to Jessica.</p><p>\u201cIf she was my sub,\u201d Kouros said, \u201cI be wondering what she\u2019d been up to.\u201d</p><p>Buchanan grinned. \u201cYep, looks guilty as hell, but she\u2019s the prettiest little perp I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>Raoul considered. If Sally had been the one to tell his family about Alicia, she\u2019d done him a favor. Yet a submissive should know better than to divulge a dom\u2019s private affairs. As a trainee in the Shadowlands, she fell under the authority of all the Masters\u2014including him. He didn\u2019t have the heart to punish her but was obligated to teach her discretion. \u201cI think I know what\u2019s up, and a bit of intimidation would be appropriate,\u201d he said. \u201cWant to interrogate her while I watch?\u201d</p><p>Kouros leaned on his cane. \u201cIt would be a pleasure.\u201d He waited until Sally turned, then gestured. Come here.</p><p>The color drained from her face, and Buchanan covered his laugh with a cough.</p><p>She crossed to them, all bounce gone, her gaze down. Across the patio, Z looked up, studied the situation for a second, grinned, and returned to talking with Olivia and Sam.</p><p>Jessica was watching, her brows drawn together. Definitely worried. Raoul leaned over to Kouros. \u201cBetter hurry, or Z\u2019s sub will spoil the fun with either a confession or a tantrum.\u201d</p><p>Kouros followed his gaze, and his lips quirked. \u201cGot it.\u201d</p><p>Sally stopped in front of the men and lifted her chin. \u201cDid you need something, Sirs?\u201d</p><p>Raoul smiled at her. \u201cTrainee, these two doms want to speak with you.\u201d His use of the word trainee put her on notice that she was expected to obey.</p><p>\u201cYes, Master Raoul.\u201d</p><p>Buchanan moved behind her, blocking the sight of her from the other submissives.</p><p>Kouros stepped forward. Big men, both doms, intimidating in size and personality. \u201cWhat we need from you is the truth,\u201d Kouros said, his clipped New England accent striking the sub like sparks from a low burning fire.</p><p>Sally tried to back up and bumped into Buchanan. He grinned at Raoul over her head. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll start with something easy,\u201d Kouros purred, setting his hand under her chin. \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSally, Sir.\u201d She made an obvious effort to stand straight, but Raoul could see her melting under the force of Kouros\u2019s personality. Experienced doms, years as FBI agents\u2014the girl didn\u2019t have a chance.</p><p>\u201cVery nice, Sally. You can tell the truth, see?\u201d His voice turned silky with approval. His free hand stroked her hair back behind her ear, both a caress\u2014and exposing her face more.</p><p>She stared up at him like a cornered mouse, an unusual change in the spirited sub.</p><p>Buchanan stroked her bare arms, adding to the sense of reward.</p><p>\u201cNow tell me what you did to Master Raoul,\u201d Kouros demanded, his voice as cold as a New England winter.</p><p>She moaned, her hands rubbing on her hips in a self-comforting motion. She tried to look at Raoul, but Kouros shifted, keeping her gaze on his face.</p><p>Raoul smothered a smile, making mental notes. He rather liked interrogation scenes, and this one was pretty lightweight...except for Sally\u2019s obvious guilt and the agent\u2019s undeniable experience with breaking down hardened criminals.</p><p>\u201cN-nothing.\u201d She pulled in a breath, lifted her chin. \u201cI haven\u2019t even seen him for a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you definitely did something, little one,\u201d Kouros said softly. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get angry with you, sweetheart.\u201d He moved closer until she could probably feel his body heat, until she had to tilt her head back to stare up at him. \u201cThere are other things Vance and I would rather do...to you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes got bigger, and the combination of anxiety and sudden arousal was a fine sight.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Jessica stepped around Buchanan. She actually shoved Kouros back a step and pulled Sally out from between the two agents. \u201cLeave her alone!\u201d</p><p>As Buchanan and Kouros moved back, Sally recovered her spirit. Her spine straightened, although she quickly edged out of grabbing distance. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAh well.\u201d Ignoring glares that should have fried his ass, Buchanan grinned at Raoul. \u201cHow about drinks for two hard-working agents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be my pleasure.\u201d Raoul looked for the other agent.</p><p>Using his cane to block Jessica, Kouros cornered Sally again. When his eyes met hers, she froze. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue this at another time, pet,\u201d he murmured. \u201cAnd I assure you, you will tell us everything we want to know.\u201d He ran a finger down her flushed cheek and smiled.</p><p>As the Fed turned away, Raoul saw Sally shiver. Then her hands fisted. \u201cNot until hell freezes over,\u201d she muttered, just loudly enough to hear.</p> <p>As Jessica slung an arm around her waist and escorted her friend back to the safety of the submissive group, Kouros joined Buchanan.</p><p>Raoul grinned at him. He had a feeling Sally would probably disappear into the bathroom the next time she spotted the agents. \u201cLet me get you a beer, Kouros.\u201d</p><p>After Raoul had taken care of his guests and introduced them to a couple of the doms they hadn\u2019t met, he returned to check the barbecue. He loaded up a platter with chicken and handed it to Joey to put on the table.</p><p>\u201cHey, Raoul,\u201d Gabi called from the back door. Her hand was in her dom\u2019s in the way they had of walking with fingers laced, and Raoul firmly stomped on his envy. As she and Marcus crossed the patio, Raoul frowned at how stiffly she moved. Had she been spanked? No, it was the more gingerly movement of a submissive unaccustomed to walking around with an anal plug. Both her and Jessica? He\u2019d think they\u2019d been up to something together, but Marcus had said they weren\u2019t going to the Shadowlands last night.</p><p>Raoul shook his head in confusion and kissed Gabi\u2019s cheek. After dutifully admiring her current arm tattoos of SpongeBob\u2014the same yellow as her halter top\u2014he slapped Marcus\u2019s arm. \u201cWelcome, my friends. There is beer in the dark coolers and wine in the light cooler.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou look like hell,\u201d Marcus said, his accent making the word sound like hey-all.</p><p>\u201cGeez, Marcus, were you raised in a barn?\u201d Gabi frowned, then looked over her dom\u2019s shoulder and grinned, bouncing once on her toes.</p><p>Raoul followed her gaze, and his muscles went rigid. Kimberly?</p><p>Dios, she was a vision in the afternoon sunlight, wearing a pretty strapless sundress, the blue the color of her eyes. Her black hair shone like a raven\u2019s wing, rippling over her tanned shoulders. He walked forward a few steps, then had second thoughts. Not your woman, Sandoval. Don\u2019t want a woman. Be polite, then keep your distance.</p><p>Uncertainty crossed her face as she stared at him, and his hand went out before he knew, offering anything she needed from him. If she ran from him again, he wouldn\u2019t be able to bear it. His mouth tightened. No. He did not want to walk this path.</p><p>Before he could withdraw his gesture, she crossed the last few steps and set her small hand into his. Unable to help himself, he drank in the sight of her, feeling as if the empty places in his heart were filling. Her hand in his trembled slightly, and he told himself to release her, but his fingers wouldn\u2019t open.</p> <p>\u201cKimberly.\u201d His voice came out ragged. But at least she wasn\u2019t throwing up at the sight of him, although it might be easier on him if she did. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYesterday?\u201d Her gaze moved over his face, and she seemed as hungry for him as he was for her. \u201cYesterday. Oh...right. The courthouse,\u201d she said. \u201cGod, I\u2019m sorry, M\u2014Raoul. Sam said you thought you\u2019d made me sick, but that wasn\u2019t it. I saw the Overseer. He came out of the courtroom right behind you, and when I heard his voice...\u201d Her color faded.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t been reacting to me. The blast of relief was like having his chest cracked open. His mouth tightened. He didn\u2019t want to feel like this.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d He needed to stop this now, not lead her on. Not encourage her. He pulled his hand back. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you again. You\u2019re looking well.\u201d</p><p>Kim\u2019s hand felt empty, as if yearning to take his again. She stared up at him. He looked tired, but oh, his face was even more darkly tanned, his black hair shaggy, brushing the collar of his blue short-sleeved shirt. The touch of his hand\u2014just the damned touch\u2014had sent a thrill through her.</p><p>For a moment, his eyes had started to smolder, but now he looked remote. Cold. Like he\u2019d been at the auction. But that expression had been for the slavers\u2014never for her. Did he no longer...?</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re here!\u201d Jessica yelled. People turned to look.</p> <p>Dan walked out and held the door for Kari, who held a tiny bundle in her arms. The baby. \u201cOh, look how little,\u201d Kim whispered.</p><p>Master R tilted his head. \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen the child yet, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d I want to stay with you.</p><p>\u201cGo see the baby, Kimberly.\u201d</p><p>An order. A definite go away. A frozen ball took up residence in the pit of her stomach.</p><p>She shouldn\u2019t have come. Why had she been so silly, building a castle of dreams made of sand? It only took a wave to wash it away.</p><p>She made her feet cross the patio and joined the women surrounding Dan, Kari, and the baby. Beth frowned, cast a quick look at Master R, and put an arm around Kim\u2019s waist. Andrea stepped to her other side, her brows pulling together.</p><p>Kari smiled a welcome and glanced in Master R\u2019s direction. \u201cIt\u2019s about time you came back, Kim. He\u2019s been a bear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding,\u201d Dan muttered.</p><p>Why did hearing that make her feel better? Not that it changed anything. Accept it, Kim. He\u2019s made the decision for you. And she needed to concentrate on her friends now. Not spoil Kari\u2019s moment with unhappiness. She forced a smile \u201cLet\u2019s see this new baby.\u201d</p><p>Kari flipped back the light blanket to reveal the baby\u2019s face and grinned at the \u201cAwwws\u201d and \u201cOooos.\u201d \u201cMeet Zane.\u201d Black hair, blue eyes like Dan\u2019s, a little chin and nose like Kari\u2019s.</p><p>Grumbling, Dan retreated from the crowd of women, casting a glance over his shoulder as if checking to be sure his two charges were safe.</p><p>Unable to resist, Kim reached out. Look at the tiny hand. His fingers closed around her thumb. \u201cHe\u2019s precious, Kari.\u201d</p><p>Kari grinned. \u201cHe really is.\u201d The tenderness in her eyes as she stared at her baby, then across to Dan, matched the way Dan\u2019s face softened, showing his pride and...love.</p><p>Kim swallowed, her throat clogging with envy, then said, \u201cI missed the baby shower, but Gabi told me this is a baby celebration, so I got you a present this morning. Got him a present, I mean.\u201d She dug into the canvas bag she had over her shoulder and handed over the gaily wrapped package.</p><p>Jessica took Zane as Kari opened the gift, then laughed and held up the blue onesie to show the writing on the front: I give the orders around here, then the back: Master Zane. Kari gurgled a laugh. \u201cOh, it\u2019s true. He\u2019s totally in charge. When Zane cries, even the big dom of the house comes running.\u201d She touched the baby\u2019s hair. \u201cAnd I love it. It\u2019s just so...\u201d Kari smiled down at her son.</p><p>Satisfying, Kim filled in. Up at all hours of the night, tending to every need. And Kari was happy.</p><p>Was that what a master got back from a relationship?</p><p>Kim shook her head. She\u2019d never tended much except boats\u2014then again, even boats need care. Patching and cleaning, oiling and barnacle scraping, doing all the tedious things that kept it running well. She never begrudged the chores, because a sturdy vessel would hold up in a storm, would bring you back to shore, would never let you down. She looked over at Master R. He was her boat.</p><p>Dan worked his way to Kari and kissed her. \u201cI set up the carrier and monitor in the little living room for when you\u2019re ready to feed him and put him down for his nap.\u201d Grinning, he took the baby. \u201cMy turn to show him off before he decides he\u2019s starving.\u201d He snuggled his son against him and headed toward the doms.</p><p>Andrea grinned. \u201cHe\u2019s so proud, it\u2019s cute.\u201d</p><p>Kari snickered. \u201cDon\u2019t be a smarty. Can you imagine how your Cullen would act?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much like that. Wouldn\u2019t they all?\u201d Andrea\u2019s smile softened as Cullen touched Zane\u2019s cheek, pleasure filling his face. \u201cHe wants children, so we\u2019ll be locking up the dungeon furniture sooner or later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHiding the equipment?\u201d Beth stared at her scar-faced dom and the gentle way he\u2019d taken the baby\u2019s fingers as if marveling at how small next to his big hand. Beth\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cThat\u2019s what Nolan was drawing last night\u2014dungeon furniture that converts into bedroom furniture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he sells it, he\u2019ll get rich. Richer.\u201d Jessica grinned. \u201cDan and Kari have started a trend. Look at those so-called hard-asses.\u201d</p><p>Kim sighed. The doms\u2019 faces turned gentle when they looked at the baby. Then each would gaze over at his submissive as if imagining her with his child. \u201cI bet some birth control pills are going to get dumped in the next few months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDios, after seeing the baby, I might not protest too much,\u201d Andrea muttered. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll let Cullen marry me after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRespectability sucks.\u201d Jessica pouted. \u201cZ said no babies until we get married, and Mom\u2019s insisting on a church wedding. You know how long those take to plan?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know the feeling,\u201d Beth grumbled. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe mine bribed Nolan to delay our wedding. With wine, no less. Men are so easy.\u201d</p><p>Kari laughed. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you took less than two weeks for a honeymoon.\u201d</p><p>Beth colored. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t as if I got to see much of anything besides the bed anyway.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, Kim watched as Dan and his son got to Sam. Sam already had grown children, didn\u2019t he? He smiled at the baby and said something to Dan that made him laugh.</p> <p>Then Master R reached out, and Dan actually put the baby in his arms. He held the little bundle easily, and a smile flashed in his dark face as tiny fists appeared out of the blanket. He rubbed his knuckles over the baby\u2019s cheek, and Kim remembered how he\u2019d do that with her when he was especially pleased or tender.</p><p>As he passed the baby to Dan, he smiled, and maybe only Kim saw the touch of envy. Her heart wrenched when, as the other men had done, his gaze came to rest on her, the heat, the sheer desire so potent that her feet started across the patio. Just because he\u2019d shown her his need.</p><p>But he shook his head and turned away, checking the food he was cooking on the giant barbecue.</p><p>She halted. He doesn\u2019t want me. Or he doesn\u2019t want to. She wanted to give him everything. Starting with herself. But he didn\u2019t feel the same. She stood in the center of the patio. Needing to retreat. Needing to go forward. Still as torn as she\u2019d been since the night he bought her.</p><p>Sam had been talking with Cullen, but he paused. He stared at her for a minute, his face expressionless, then leaned over and spoke to Master R.</p> <p>Master R\u2019s muscles contracted beneath his thin cotton shirt before he slowly turned. With an unreadable expression, he walked over and stood beside her, pretending to watch Kari. \u201cHe\u2019s a pretty baby, no?\u201d He didn\u2019t touch her. Didn\u2019t smile.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She stared at her feet. He\u2019d only said he loved her that one time. Dammit, she shouldn\u2019t have come. This was unbearable. She glanced up and saw the smoldering need in his gaze, like a surge of electricity to her own desire. And then he buried it again.</p><p>\u201cDamn you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He frowned. \u201cChiquita, what is wrong?\u201d He touched her, the graze of his knuckles, the tenderness exactly as with the baby. This man would never take his loved ones for granted; she knew that right down to the bottom of her heart. He\u2019d cherish and protect, care for with everything in him.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t want me though. But she wanted him. And she was tired of trying to make a decision. Let him decide for both of us\u2014hey, that\u2019s what he wants, right? To be in charge?</p><p>And suddenly, it was so easy after all. Turning her head, she kissed his fingers and saw him freeze. She let her bag drop to the pavement and slipped down to her knees.</p> <p>Over the pounding of her heart, she heard a squeak. Jessica.</p><p>She pulled her bag closer. It held something she\u2019d cried over, thrown across the room, kissed, hated and cursed, and then cuddled at night. The concrete was hot against her legs. The scent of the ocean hung in the air as she took out the collar he\u2019d given her, the one she\u2019d found on the stairs the night of the auction. The leather was smooth, and she traced her fingers over the words Master Raoul\u2019s gatita.</p><p>Am I still?</p><p>She laid it over her palms, trying to bow her head but failing. She needed to see his face or she might die. She raised it up. \u201cMay I wear your collar, Master?\u201d she asked and heard no sound on the patio at all except the surging of the ocean and the hammering of her heart.</p><p>His silence terrified her. For a moment, his eyes kindled as if a fire had lit behind them, and his breath ran ragged. Then his face grew remote... Her Master R had stepped behind his walls. His voice was gentle but firm. \u201cNo. I\u2019m sorry, Kimberly. I cannot be your master.\u201d</p><p>Like a knife wound, his words sliced through her, cutting open her flesh, driving ruthlessly into her chest. The pain arrived a second later. Her protest escaped before she could think. \u201cBut... You wanted this. Wanted me.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his palm over his mouth, his eyes unhappy. \u201cI did,\u201d he said so softly she barely heard him. His voice strengthened. \u201cBut it cannot work between us. You don\u2019t want a master. You never did and even less now, after what you\u2019ve been through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan you be that sure, cari\u00f1o?\u201d he asked so softly.</p><p>She started to say yes, then caught his intent look. \u201cNo,\u201d she said honestly and blinked back the tears. \u201cBut I\u2019ll regret it all my life if we don\u2019t try. I want to try.\u201d She swallowed. \u201cMaster, please.\u201d</p><p>He just looked at her, and his gaze filled with pain. \u201cI...can\u2019t. No.\u201d</p><p>She bowed her head, trying not to give in to tears. She\u2019d promised herself she wouldn\u2019t cry, no matter what happened.</p><p>Master R hadn\u2019t moved. It was up to her to get out of here. Out of his way. Out of his party and his life. Her chest had hollowed out, an aching hole where her heart had been. This was far worse than leaving him before. At least then, she\u2019d had hope.</p><p>She put the collar back in her bag, touching it like a tiny being that had died. Her legs didn\u2019t cooperate when she tried to stand.</p><p>A hand appeared in front of her face. Not Master R\u2019s thick-boned, powerful hand. This was lean, fingernails groomed, a dark watch on the wrist. She wrapped her fingers around his palm, and the man pulled her to her feet with a graceful strength.</p><p>Master Z. When he tucked her into his side, she leaned against him. \u201cDon\u2019t quit yet, little one,\u201d he whispered in her ear.</p><p>\u201cCan you see she gets home, Z?\u201d Master R asked. The smoothness and lilt had fled his voice, adding to her sorrow.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so, Raoul.\u201d</p><p>She started to say she\u2019d get herself home, but Z\u2019s arm around her squeezed the air from her lungs.</p><p>Master R\u2019s face tightened, anger shadowing his eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t interfere in what you don\u2019t understand, my friend,\u201d he said, a threat hanging in the air.</p><p>\u201cI think I understand quite well,\u201d Z said mildly. \u201cYour marriage left scars. And you don\u2019t want to be hurt again, but this little one keeps doing it. She\u2019s finally made up her mind, but you can\u2019t be sure and aren\u2019t about to risk it again. Unfortunately, she can\u2019t give you a guarantee, especially after everything she\u2019s been through. Do I have it about right?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d hurt him when she\u2019d left? Oh God, she really had. She\u2019d been so stupidly focused on herself, thinking he was self-sufficient. She hadn\u2019t looked at what she was doing to him. \u201cI\u2019m so, so sorry,\u201d she whispered, wincing at the misery flickering across his face.</p><p>\u201cThis is not the place to discuss this,\u201d Master R said tightly. \u201cTake her ho\u2014\u201d</p><p>Z smiled faintly. \u201cThis is exactly the place. Nothing in life is guaranteed, Raoul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d Master R\u2019s gaze dropped to her face, unyielding. Unhappy. \u201cKimberly, I tried living in a relationship without...being who I am. I can\u2019t do that again. And you cannot submit to a master, not after what you\u2019ve been through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I did. I can.\u201d Yet she wasn\u2019t totally sure herself. This wouldn\u2019t be a limited few days, and she\u2019d already capsized on him once. Why should he trust her? How could he trust her? \u201cIs there,\u201d she said slowly, \u201ca test? A shakedown cruise? Something to prove to us both that it can work?\u201d</p><p>She saw his spark of hope flare, then die. He smiled ruefully. \u201cThere\u2019s no\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTraditionally,\u201d Z said casually, \u201ca submissive is whipped when receiving her collar as a way of showing her submission, her trust in her master.\u201d</p><p>Whipped? Her mind went blank, and she tried to pull away from Z.</p><p>The iron bar of his arm didn\u2019t release. \u201cYou\u2019ve been whipped in front of strangers, little one. Would you like to enjoy one in front of friends\u2014given by your master?\u201d</p><p>Whip. A shiver ran through her, and Master R growled, his hand fisting. \u201cDamn you. She can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>So many she cant\u2019s coming from him. I can do anything if I want it enough. Maybe she did want it. Just as Master R had replaced her horrible nightmares of other men by making love to her, now she could replace memories of cruelty with his care. And perhaps create something for them both to fall back on. She\u2019d never trusted him more or felt so close to him as after the fireplay scene. If he wanted her to do this, then she knew she could...and it might help her doubts as well. \u201cYes, please, Master R,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Silence. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Catch-22. If she accepted his mastery, then he had the right to say no, but if he said no, then she had no master. She bent her head. \u201cI want the tradition if it pleases Master. I will take any pain you want to give me, take anything you do. We both need an answer.\u201d</p><p>Silence. Then a heavy sigh. \u201cThis master is going to kill Z.\u201d</p><p>Z chuckled. His arm dropped from her, and he simply walked away.</p><p>Master R laid his hand against Kim\u2019s face. He studied her, seeing her in the way no one else had ever done. \u201cYou would face your fears\u2014bear pain for me\u2014just for a chance to be together?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She nodded.</p><p>He looked away, brows drawn. Thinking.</p><p>Hope started to tap-dance over her heart. She held so, so still, not wanting to interrupt his thoughts.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His expression changed. His shoulders straightened. His mouth firmed. Everything about him coalesced into the master she loved. \u201cThen, gatita, it would please me to test your submission in front of our friends.\u201d</p><p>How had this happened? Raoul stared down at Kimberly, trying to batter down the hope rising inside him. She couldn\u2019t do this, couldn\u2019t truly submit.</p><p>And, if she could, what would it prove? Really?</p><p>But if she could face her worst fears for him, how could he not do as much for her?</p><p>If she could submit to him, here, in fear and in public, he\u2019d know that she\u2019d work as hard as he would to make a D/s relationship succeed.</p><p>A shiver ran through her, and he pulled her into his arms, giving her comfort. Whether she succeeded or not, he would withhold nothing. She needed to trust him, to want to please him. After so long apart, to do this now was foolish\u2014yet neither of them could tolerate waiting. He knew that as well.</p><p>He rested his cheek on the top of her head, inhaling her light fragrance. He\u2019d forgotten\u2014 tried to forget\u2014how she fit against him, how her strong arms would hold him as tightly as he held her.</p><p>After a minute, Raoul lifted his head and motioned for Cullen. \u201cYou know where the dungeon is. Can you get the box labeled patio and set it up at the archway? Bring wrist and ankle cuffs as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it, buddy.\u201d Cullen grinned at Kimberly and tugged her hair. \u201cWelcome home, pet. Why didn\u2019t you come over and say hi last night?\u201d</p><p>She gave him a shrug, looking away, her body stiff.</p><p>Raoul frowned. She wasn\u2019t usually rude. She relaxed when Cullen moved away.</p><p>Last night. Cullen would have been playing bartender at the Shadowlands all evening. \u201cCome over and say hi.\u201d</p><p>Obviously, Kim had been at the club, probably with Gabi. Maybe conversing with guilty little Sally. Kim had met his family in the hospital; he\u2019d heard them talking in the hall. It didn\u2019t take a calculus formula to figure out the answer. But this was not the time to deal with family issues. Instead... He rubbed his cheek on her silky hair and asked, \u201cDid you get the furry present I sent you?\u201d</p><p>Her laugh\u2014how long had it been since he\u2019d heard her soft laugh. \u201cMy Ari. He\u2019s wonderful and...\u201d</p><p>Contently, Raoul held her, ignoring the conversations around them, and listened to her telling of returning to work, of the big dog, of her life. As Cullen and Nolan set up chains from the bolts in the patio cover beams, he answered her questions about Costa Rica.</p><p>She\u2019d missed him and tried to call him. The knowledge was far too pleasing. \u201cI missed you, sumisita,\u201d he admitted in return. She was being gut-wrenchingly honest and more courageous than he was. \u201cMy home is empty without you, and I couldn\u2019t bear the silence.\u201d</p><p>Her arms tightened around him, and he bent down and took her lips. Soft and welcoming as she molded against him, keeping nothing of herself in return. Her body was fragrant and even lusher than when she\u2019d left. He wanted to explore, to fill his palms with her breasts.</p><p>When he lifted his head, she made a tiny sound of protest. One a man should not make, but a man might feel. After a slow breath, he noticed Cullen had set cuffs on the table nearby.</p><p>Time to start. One by one, he slowly fastened the cuffs on his sumisa, cherishing the way she held out an ankle, her wrist, offering herself. Her pleasure was obvious in her open stance and her curving lips. She wanted his cuffs.</p><p>He ran his finger around the insides to ensure they weren\u2019t too tight, then rose and checked the setup at the edge of his patio. Chains dangled from rings he\u2019d installed in the support beam. Two more chains lay at the base of the four-by-four posts. Ready.</p> <p>Was Kimberly? Her breathing had sped up, and she was biting her lip. But she nodded firmly. \u201cI\u2019m ready, Master.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d always known she\u2019d break his heart. His hand slipped down under the hem of her sundress and between her legs. Small panties, already damp. Her muscles were tensed with anxiety, but her pussy showed her arousal. Maybe, maybe she could do this. His hopes flared. \u201cRemove your clothing.\u201d</p><p>Her breath hitched, and a flush grew in her cheeks. But she pulled the sundress over her head in one smooth move. The sight of her breasts\u2014yes, fuller than before\u2014sent a bolt of lust through him.</p><p>She pushed down her tiny panties\u2014the ruffles matched the ones on the dress, he noticed appreciatively.</p><p>\u201cAre you still ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Master.\u201d Her lips formed around the word as if she liked the taste of it in her mouth, and he was grateful she hadn\u2019t hated it like she had the word slave\u2014he enjoyed very much the sound of his title when she said it.</p><p>Mine. His heart uttered the word again and again. Submitting to him. Nothing could give a dom more of a rush in a scene. In life? Nothing filled a dom\u2019s heart so fully.</p><p>Unable to resist, he pulled her against him, curved his fingers around her nape, and plundered her sweet lips. He ran his hand over her ass, massaging the roundness, still cool, but soon to be glowing with heat.</p><p>He held her eyes, rejoicing to see them so clear and free of fear. \u201cI love you, gatita.\u201d</p><p>Her heart melted right down into a puddle. Never, ever would she tire of hearing that. \u201cI love you, Master.\u201d</p><p>When she finally looked away from him, she saw the tables and chairs on the patio had been moved to form a semicircle, leaving a large open area. For a whip.</p><p>\u201cMaster Raoul.\u201d Z stood a few feet away. His dark gray eyes held hers as he said, \u201cTell your submissive what you wish to use so she might bring you the proper tools.\u201d</p><p>Tools? Things he\u2019d use on her. To hurt her... She wrenched her gaze away and realized people had congregated around the patio. Watching. Like at an exhibit or a slavers\u2019 stage. Her horrified gaze fell on Gabi.</p><p>Gabi jerked her chin up and then deliberately made a fist, arcing it in the tugboat hand signal for full speed ahead.</p><p>Kim blinked. Well.</p><p>Next to her hard-faced dom, Beth had her hands clasped together, and her lips moved, You can do it.</p><p>Andrea gave her a firm nod of encouragement.</p><p>Kari\u2019s eyes had tears in them, but she waggled a baby monitor emphatically and mouthed, \u201cYes. Do it.\u201d</p><p>Jessica was alternating glaring at Z and nodding vigorously at Kim.</p><p>Not an exhibit. I have my own set of cheerleaders.</p><p>\u201cI think you agreed on whips?\u201d Z asked, as if deliberately rubbing her fears raw.</p><p>A shudder ran through her, but she forced steel into her spine. I fought the Overseer and Greville and won. Can I be less brave in going after my dreams?</p><p>Master R\u2019s face held only fury as he stared at Z, but then he sighed and smiled. \u201cRemind me to hurt Z after this.\u201d</p><p>Master R is on my side. He always is. But she could...almost...understand the pressure Z was putting on her. This was her opportunity to prove herself to them both, and Master Z would make it a proper test. She raised her chin. \u201cCan Master describe his wishes?\u201d</p><p>His hand touched her cheek gently, his gaze intensifying, as if he assessed her determination, and his lips curved with approval. \u201cMy gatita makes me proud.\u201d</p><p>God, everything in her melted, and she felt as if she\u2019d drown in his eyes.</p><p>Master R thought a minute. \u201cI want you to bring me the flogger with a faint yellow stripe on the handle, a crop\u2014one with soft leather\u2014and the bullwhip on the leftmost side. You will do this to please me, Kimberly.\u201d</p><p>The bullwhip. Her mouth was too dry, so she gave him a jerky nod and walked off the patio. Her legs didn\u2019t seem to belong to her, but they were moving, and that was all she could ask.</p><p>The dungeon was cool. Quiet. And, oddly, held no fears, just memories of Master R: Leaning against a wall and counting with his fingers as she walked around the room. Massaging her on the bondage table. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to fall into pieces if I touch your breasts.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d led her out of panic each time\u2014her wish to please him would work that magic again. It must.</p><p>The crop was easy and she picked one with the softest leather. The flogger he\u2019d actually teased her with once and let her play with. The bullwhip...</p><p>She got near and couldn\u2019t touch it. Had to circle to get close. Another circle. Did he even know how to use a whip? What if he\u2014No, this was Master R. If he used something, he\u2019d be superb. She\u2019d never seen him practice though.</p><p>That was scary. During the next detour, she frowned at the empty space on one side of the room. She\u2019d never wondered why it was there. A newspaper was clamped chest-high on the wall, thin strips of it dangling like streamers. She shivered. Maybe he did practice.</p><p>Another circle.</p><p>Enough stalling. I will do this. She brought up in her memory the approval on Master R\u2019s face. \u201cYou will do this to please me.\u201d The need to see that approval again grew, slowly outweighing her fear.</p><p>Her fingers closed on the whip, and she whispered a vow to herself. \u201cI\u2019m going to learn to use this damned thing. Rip up some newspapers myself. See if I don\u2019t.\u201d Her hand tightened on the leather.</p><p>As she stepped out onto the patio in the bright sun, she saw Master R in the middle. He\u2019d taken his shirt off to get ready for the scene, obviously never doubting her courage. The sight of the contoured muscles on his chest and arms made her stop. So powerful. She smiled, remembering when she\u2019d said that to him. He\u2019d laughed and picked her up so, so easily, murmuring into her hair, \u201cThe better to hold you with.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A thin pink ridge ran across his left ribs where Greville\u2019s knife had cut, an atrocity on his beautiful, tan skin, and anger flared in her. Then she huffed a laugh, glancing down at her own scar. They were definitely a matched set now.</p><p>The people around the patio went completely silent as she crossed to him. She knelt at his feet. \u201cI brought your tools as you asked, Master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did very, very well.\u201d He took everything from her, setting it all on the ground off to one side. His stride was as she\u2019d remembered in her dreams\u2014unhurried, steady, and solid.</p><p>With an easy yank, he lifted her to her feet, then rested his hands on her shoulders, massaging lightly. \u201cYou will take everything I give you today,\u201d he said, holding her gaze. His eyes were filled with a dark promise of pain and pleasure.</p><p>A thrill of anticipation went through her. He\u2019d never pushed her in the dungeon, but now, now his eyes promised he would today. Oh God. \u201cI will, Master.\u201d It was a vow for both of them. I will.</p><p>He guided her under the chains, facing her toward the ocean and away from the audience. After restraining her arms over her head, he secured her legs apart, opening them widely, before tightening the chains to her arms. He circled her slowly, looking her over, his gaze like a caress on her bare skin. He stopped in front of her, cupping her chin in his palm. \u201cI\u2019ve dreamed of seeing you here, like this,\u201d he said, his voice a little rough. \u201cOpen to me, wanting what I can give you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want that,\u201d she whispered, every cell in her needing to please him. And she\u2019d take whatever he asked so he\u2019d be proud, would know how much she loved him. The need to give, to accept, filled her.</p><p>He kissed her, his tongue taking her, his lips demanding but so, so sweet. When he lifted his head, her breath came thick and hot. Obviously someone had turned the humidity up on the patio.</p><p>His hand glided over her shoulder, then her back, as he walked around her, and then lower: her bottom, her legs...</p><p>When he stroked up her inner thighs, she jerked.</p><p>\u201cBe still, gatita.\u201d Warm hands. Firm touch.</p><p>Just like her dreams. She realized her pussy was wet with her arousal.</p><p>\u201cVery nice, Kimberly. I like this.\u201d His fingers slid through her folds, making her shiver. The murmur of conversation came to her, then disappeared under the rush of heat as his fingers pressed her labia open and ran over her clit. She bit her lip as electricity sizzled through her.</p><p>He teased her clit and then eased a finger inside her and out.</p><p>Legs wide apart, she was exposed to anything he wanted to do, and...it was the most erotic thing she\u2019d ever felt in her life, knowing she\u2019d willingly given him the power.</p><p>He rose to his feet.</p><p>Oh no. Her thoughts stuttered at the memory of the tools. \u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>The smack on her ass stung. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaster R. Master, what are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever I want to, sumisita m\u00eda.\u201d His voice wasn\u2019t mean, just that firmness that sent quivers into her stomach and more wetness between her legs.</p><p>He chuckled and pressed his body against hers from behind, his erection pushing on her buttocks, his muscular chest heating her back, his arms surrounding her. \u201cPretty gatita, are you ready?\u201d His fingers tweaked her nipples, and his touch sent streaks of pain straight down to her clit.</p><p>He gathered her hair and moved it forward over her shoulder. Baring her back. She tensed, but he only ran his hands up and down, waking her skin, making her breasts sway.</p><p>He slapped her bottom lightly, a tiny sting, then harder, and more, until she wanted to move away from the burning. She arched away\u2014uselessly.</p> <p>\u201cS\u00ed, I like knowing you have to stay put to take what I give you,\u201d he murmured and walked around to face her, his hand always on her, stroking from her back to her shoulder. Her bottom burned, and her skin was so sensitive that even the touch of the sea breeze felt like an icy kiss.</p><p>His lips brushed hers. Then he captured her mouth with hungry urgency. \u201cI\u2019ve missed kissing you. So...you will tell me if the pain becomes too much, no? What is your safe word?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCramp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good.\u201d His grin flashed at her. \u201cWhich will make you scream first, gatita\u2014the sting of the lash or the fury of your orgasm?\u201d</p><p>Oh boy, how could he terrify her and turn her on at the same time? Sensuality darkened his face as he regarded her, not hiding the pleasure he got from playing with her. Not hiding his intention to exercise his power as her master.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m here. Doing this...wanting this. Yet the more she surrendered, the more she felt a part of him.</p><p>He knew. He touched her cheek, his gaze softening.</p><p>She stared at him helplessly, bound with more than physical restraints.</p><p>The flogger he used next didn\u2019t hurt. Like a million elves drumming on her skin, the strands of the flogger moved from her back to her front.</p><p>She stared at him, almost mesmerized. So big, shoulders broad, his chest and arm muscles rippled with each movement. His control was absolute, his focus totally on her and the flogger as if it connected them like an umbilical cord.</p><p>He lightened the strokes over her stomach and thighs, even lighter over her breasts, making them swell and throb. The very lightest flick between her legs sent her up onto her toes with surprise, followed by a hot rush of pleasure.</p><p>He saw, and a smile softened his stern features. As he circled her, her skin grew more sensitive, started to burn. And somehow her pussy throbbed as if it had swollen too much.</p><p>A pause. His hands stroked her body, soothing the ache. He moved in front of her and studied her for a silent moment. Then the corners of his eyes crinkled. \u201cYou are very beautiful, all aroused and ready for the bite of the lash.\u201d His palms covered her breasts, and he watched her intently as he pinched her nipples lightly, then harder, rolling the peaks between his fingers.</p><p>She closed her eyes as pleasure washed through her.</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>She forced her eyes open, stiffening as his hand moved to her pussy, sliding through her folds. The streak of sharp pleasure was almost painful, unexpected, and she made a protesting sound.</p><p>\u201cShhh, gatita. You want this\u2014there is no shame in it, in being a woman. In letting your master rouse your body.\u201d He smiled, fingers pushing intimately inside her, then out and over her clit. Over and in, repeating until her hips pressed forward into each movement.</p><p>Oh God, I need more. She hadn\u2019t dreamed she could get so hot, so needy.</p><p>Then he smiled. \u201cVery good. You\u2019re ready.\u201d His gaze was level, direct, utterly in control and confident.</p><p>And she nodded. She could handle pain if he was in charge.</p><p>He kissed her slowly and then ravenously. \u201cSumisita m\u00eda,\u201d he said, tipping her chin up. \u201cAfter this, I intend to take you.\u201d He shifted uncomfortably. \u201cHard.\u201d</p><p>Her vagina clenched. As her gaze dropped to his groin, delight rose inside her. \u201cAs Master wishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my gatita\u2019s submission\u2014and body\u2014makes me needy.\u201d He touched his nose to hers, took in her breath. \u201cI\u2019ve missed taking you every morning before breakfast.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and breathed, \u201cMe too.\u201d Waking alone, wanting him so much she\u2019d slept with an extra pillow to have something to hold.</p><p>He pressed another kiss to her lips, then walked away. A second later, she heard the crack of a whip.</p><p>Panic rolled over her, drowning her in memories. Slicing pain after pain, screaming. She pulled frantically at the chains, her breathing a tropical storm turning into a hurricane.</p><p>\u201cKimberly.\u201d His voice cut through the winds. \u201cYou will take this for me.\u201d</p><p>Silence grew around her, the fears held at bay with just his voice...and her need to please him. Master R, not Greville. Master R would stop if she needed him to...and so she could go on. \u201cYes, Master. I will.\u201d</p><p>The first touch of the whip was a flicker: here, there, up, and down. A little sting, the rhythm almost soothing. A brush over her skin like a rough kiss. More. She\u2019d never watched whipping scenes. Who knew it could be so...sensuous?</p><p>After a while, he walked forward to rub her back. Played with her breasts, sending new sparks of arousal flickering through her body. His erection pressed into her from behind, and he ground it against her bottom, making her feel the lingering burn from her spanking. His fist closed in her hair, tugging her head to the side. His voice was low and ruthless, sending a thrill through her. \u201cNow, I\u2019m going to push you, Kimberly. And you will take it\u2014for me.\u201d</p><p>He obviously felt her shiver; his laugh was guttural. Terrifying. Hot. He moved away, but she could hear him. \u201cThat\u2019s my good girl.\u201d</p><p>A crack, a tiny whoosh, then the sting, pain blooming beneath her skin. She gasped, a little shocked. That hurt. He kept on, over and over, like the bite of flame from the fireplay, the whip was a flash of pain that almost seemed to light her up inside.</p><p>Down her ass, a few touches on her thighs that zapped straight to her clit until\u2014oh, God, she was shaking with the need to come.</p><p>The intensity increased. More. Sharper. She sucked in her breath to keep from yelling. He eased off to the sweet brushing strokes. Harder again. Stinging, shocking, burning...pain.</p><p>Nothing moved, but she fell backward, tumbling into the ocean, surrounded by softness. Her eyes half-focused on the tide rolling in on the white shore, and she realized his strokes were timed to the ocean waves. The pain hit and rolled over her, flowing back out before the next one. So wonderful yet so arousing. The whip strokes slowly moved down her ass, her thighs, and back up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His body was against hers again, warm, holding her.</p><p>\u201cEyes on me,\u201d he said, turning her head. Brown gaze, calm and wonderful.</p><p>She smiled at him and savored his grin.</p><p>\u201cLook at you. Even under a whip, you trusted me enough to hit subspace,\u201d he murmured, kissing her until the ground disappeared from under her. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of you, gatita.\u201d He pulled back. \u201cTell me your safe word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCramp. Only I don\u2019t need it,\u201d she confided.</p><p>His eyes crinkled. \u201cI\u2019m going to give you five more, and they will hurt.\u201d</p><p>A worry started to rise in her. She heard the sharp crack behind her, but nothing hit.</p><p>\u201cTake a breath, gatita.\u201d Firm. Her master.</p><p>An orgasm seemed to be floating inside, waiting, as she inhaled.</p><p>\u201cLet it out.\u201d</p><p>She breathed out and heard a crack and razor-sharp pain shot across her right buttock. She sucked in a breath, feeling her body jerk, and as she exhaled, another line of fire hit. Yet it was Master R doing it, expecting her to handle it, making her take it, and that sent her even deeper. Tears rolled down her cheeks. Another razor cut of pain jolted her to her core and another\u2014 white-hot pain\u2014and another.</p><p>Through the surging of the blood in her head, she heard his footsteps. His arms surrounded her, pulled her into his warmth. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of you. You have pleased me very much,\u201d he murmured into her hair.</p><p>She blinked at him. \u201cI will take more if you need me to, Master.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cDo you want more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But if you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, gatita. You\u2019re not a masochist.\u201d He kissed her cheek. \u201cFor which I am very happy. You have had enough.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, still half in the clouds, and when he kissed her long and slow, her whole body reminded her of what she wanted. \u201cCan we go somewhere and...?\u201d</p><p>His head lifted, brown eyes keen. Hot.</p><p>\u201cAnd make love,\u201d she finished. It would be love. She knew that.</p><p>His grin flashed. \u201cAre you saying, \u2018Just fuck me already?\u2019\u201d</p><p>She choked, but the throbbing of her lower half wouldn\u2019t be denied. \u201cYes, Master. If Master pleases.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that will please Master,\u201d he said, gripping her hair. \u201cBut we aren\u2019t going inside, Kimberly.\u201d</p><p>Out here? Her eyes rounded.</p> <p>Laughing softly, he unsnapped the chains holding her legs apart and then reached up to the panic snaps above. Two clicks, and she was free. She groaned as she lowered her arms, her shoulders aching. Her knees wobbling.</p><p>He picked her up, snuggling her against his bare chest. His clean, masculine scent surrounded her, musky from the exercise, making her want to rub her skin over his. She felt small in his arms, delicate and cherished.</p><p>He crossed the patio and sat her on the unused wooden table. \u201cLie on your back, sumisa,\u201d he said and folded his arms over his chest.</p><p>Even though sweat covered her body, she felt the flush rising in her face.</p><p>When he lifted his eyebrows slightly, she knew she didn\u2019t want to let him down. Never. She lay back.</p><p>\u201cSuch a good girl,\u201d he murmured, the heat in his eyes scorching across her skin. \u201cWhen we met, you preferred pain to sharing the intimacy of your orgasm in front of others,\u201d he said, running his hands over her breasts. \u201cWill you offer it to me now?\u201d</p><p>Make love here? In front of...everyone?</p><p>His eyes held hers. Demanding...more. That she surrender everything. And she wanted to. \u201cI will do whatever Master wants,\u201d she said. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>His gaze softened. \u201cYou took pain for me, Kimberly,\u201d he said soberly. \u201cNow can you take being restrained\u2014and then pleasure?\u201d</p><p>Shivers ran over her body. \u201cYes, Master.\u201d</p><p>His hand stroked over her leg, warming her flesh for a moment. Then he pushed her legs against her chest and slid her down the table until her bottom was just over the edge. A tremor ran through her. The drifty feeling hadn\u2019t quite disappeared, but she rapidly returned to the real world as he hooked her wrist cuffs to the edges of the table even with her waist. He moved her left leg so he could clip the ankle cuff to her wrist cuff and did the same on her right, spreading her legs widely.</p><p>Her pussy was exposed. Very exposed. He stood back as she conquered the first shudder of fear. She stared at him, using him as her anchor, knowing he\u2019d keep her safe.</p><p>His broad hands ran over her body. \u201cI\u2019ve missed having a little submissive bound and open before me,\u201d he said softly. His knuckles trailed down her cheek. \u201cTo have one that loves me and tries so hard to please me is an even better feeling.\u201d</p><p>Everything inside her melted.</p><p>\u201cBut this is a test for you. Will you yield me everything?\u201d He unhooked a wide canvas strap from under the table and pulled it across her low stomach, just above her mound. \u201cEven when I take the last few bits of movement from you?\u201d He secured it tightly, pinning her hips against the smooth table.</p><p>\u201cYes, Master.\u201d She tried not to wiggle, to test the restraints, and couldn\u2019t help herself. But her hips wouldn\u2019t move at all. Panic rose and fell like the tide.</p><p>\u201cAnd a test for me as well. Do I trust your surrender enough that I will push you as I should and give us both what we need?\u201d The ruthless determination in his gaze shook her to the core. \u201cI trust you more than I thought I could. Are you all right, gatita?\u201d</p><p>Fear didn\u2019t stand a chance next to Raoul Sandoval, her master. She smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful Kimberly.\u201d He leaned an arm on the table, filling her vision.</p><p>His lips brushed over hers, and he kissed her, severing the current of fear, replacing it with need. His warm hand closed over her breast, cupping it, teasing the nipple to a point even as he stroked his tongue over hers, as he reminded her of his taste, his scent, his possession.</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d He lifted his head and smiled, whispering, \u201cYou look like you need to be fucked, sumisa.\u201d</p><p>And everybody probably saw that. She glared at him and earned a pinch on her nipple that made her gasp. Her breasts were swollen, as if they\u2019d grown a cup size, leaving the skin too tight. Her nipples throbbed, and she could feel the odd stings from where he\u2019d lashed her lightly. He bent down and licked over each nipple, circling them, leaving them wet so the breeze cooled them, tightening them further.</p><p>More. Her back arched.</p><p>\u201cToo much movement.\u201d Straps went across her, above and below her breasts, constricting everything between until the mounds were pushed up tightly.</p><p>And she really couldn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed, I like that.\u201d He smiled and closed his big hands over her aching breasts, fondling with calloused palms and pinching her nipples lightly. Her clit started throbbing to match the ache in her breasts.</p><p>She wanted to beg for more and knew he\u2019d just laugh and do whatever he wanted in his own time. God, why did being naked and exposed, restrained and unable to stop him, make her so, so hot?</p><p>He stepped back, regarding her...as if considering all the dirty, dark things he could do to her. Her insides clenched with desire.</p><p>What would he do? His hands? Mouth? Toys? But she hadn\u2019t fetched up any plugs or clamps or... Her breath stopped as he walked out of sight. I brought him a crop.</p><p>Oh no. No no no.</p><p>Master R strolled back into her field of vision, tapping the long, thin rod on his palm. Oh God, he was going to. Her breasts were pointing up like two targets, her legs wide, her labia gaping open. He wouldn\u2019t...would he? She felt the trickle of her own moisture from her pussy down to her asshole.</p><p>\u201cLook at that,\u201d he said softly. He rubbed the crop\u2019s leather flap over her breasts, teasing her nipples. \u201cAll excited. Not a hint of fear in you.\u201d</p><p>She realized it was true. The anticipation of pain seemed to just turn her on further.</p><p>\u201cI was watching when Jessica told you about how Z restrained her on the Shadowlands bar.\u201d The crop trailed down her stomach, flickered over her labia.</p><p>Oh God. Just the touch of it, the teasing. She felt swollen, tight. Desperate.</p><p>His fingers followed the leather. The contrast between cool and warm, smooth and rough, inanimate and alive, made her body pulse with need.</p><p>At the foot of the table, he smiled slightly as he traced her folds with one finger, up and over her clit. Deliberately, mercilessly increasing her arousal.</p><p>He pushed a finger into her, sliding easily, his thick knuckles adding to the swelling sensation. Two fingers, and his tongue licked over her clit, bringing her higher. Her thighs quivered as she tried to raise her pussy higher, to get more. Nothing\u2014absolutely nothing\u2014 moved. She was pinned, completely immobile.</p><p>Master R pulled his fingers out of her vagina slowly and ran his slick hand over her leg. \u201cShe told you how he used a whip on her pussy.\u201d</p><p>He hit her inner thigh with the crop\u2014the very tip of the leather flap. The sting made her gasp.</p><p>\u201cI saw how much it excited you, gatita. To think of having your pussy whipped.\u201d The crop made its way up the inside of her thigh to the top of her mound. Each flick of the leather against her skin stung.</p><p>Her entire body tensed in anticipation of that small pain landing on her throbbing clit, but he continued up, hitting her lightly across her stomach.</p><p>She jumped when the crop hit the underside of her right breast. He circled, once, twice, around her breast. It was so tight, each sting reverberated through the whole mound. Her breathing was like a boat tossing in the waves, finding and losing its rhythm. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He stroked her hair away from her face, studying her carefully, his eyes intent and hot...very hot. Without speaking, he moved to her left breast. Around and around. How could they possibly feel tighter? she wondered, hearing a low whine escape her.</p><p>\u201cYes, give me the sounds.\u201d The leather flicked sharply over her peaked left nipple.</p><p>The sudden sting bit like sharp teeth into the sensitive tip and felt as if he\u2019d also struck her clit. \u201cAh!\u201d Her spine tried to arch; her hands jerked; nothing moved. The feeling of being trapped passing into complete heat as he flicked her right nipple.</p><p>Back and forth, leaving only enough time for the bite of pain to dissipate before hitting the other nipple. Her breasts felt as if they were on fire yet so very, very swollen and needy.</p><p>He bent and pulled a peak into his mouth, gentle lips, heat, but when he sucked, pulling strongly, her whole body shook like a leaf. Oh God.</p><p>As he changed to the other nipple, hot, sucking, her insides started to coil, pressure building inside.</p><p>His brown eyes met hers as he lifted his head. \u201cYou\u2019re very close to coming, gatita.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed, wanting to beg. Please, please, now. He wouldn\u2019t, she knew. The knowledge that he had control, everything was up to him, and she could do nothing about it increased her need as if someone had opened her motor to full throttle, sending excitement humming through her.</p><p>He trailed his hand down her body, soothing the little bites the crop had left over her breasts, her stomach, her thighs.</p><p>The crop smacked her thigh again. Slightly harder, like a kitten with sharp milk teeth. Up toward her pussy, over her mound, down her leg. Aching. She could feel her engorged clit trying to extend, trying for attention, and she shuddered with fearful anticipation.</p><p>Up her leg again, only this time, the flicks hit her outer labia. Pinpricks of pain, up and down her newly shaved, tender flesh, each time closer to the apex. To her clit.</p><p>Her breath hitched as he almost...</p><p>The crop lifted. Everything inside her tightened. Her inner folds were swollen, wet, as a cool breeze washed over her. Her vulnerable clit pulsed, filling her world. She stared at the crop, in the air, as her muscles pulled against the restraints.</p><p>His eyes met hers.</p><p>The crop hit directly on her clit. Pain. Pleasure. The sensations mixed, raw and brutal, exploding up and out. Her body tried to shake itself free as the waves of pleasure ripped through her. The scream turned to gasping wails as her pussy contracted over and over.</p><p>She pulled in a breath.</p><p>The only warning was a touch at her entrance, and then he sheathed his cock in her with one merciless thrust. She gasped in shock. He was too big, her tissues too swollen.</p><p>His groin brushed over her abused clit, sending waves and waves of pleasure and pain ripping through her again. He held still for a second, letting her adjust, then looked her in the eyes. \u201cI\u2019m going to take you hard now.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t ask permission. God, he felt so huge inside her. She tried to move, and the straps held her in place. Open. She felt possessed, taken. Owned.</p><p>Leaning forward onto one forearm, he pushed in deeper. \u201cLook at me, gatita.\u201d His voice was rougher, lower. \u201cKeep your eyes on me.\u201d His free hand curled under her ass, making the stripes there burn as he pulled back. And then he drove into her, using his legs, his hips. The piercing was like a solid finger rubbing her right...right on that inside spot. God.</p><p>Kimberly\u2019s pussy contracted around Raoul, hot and slick, battering at his dick. Dios, he\u2019d missed being inside her, missed the connection. In his mind, this was the proper way to end a scene between a couple. Making love confirmed the bonds they\u2019d built.</p><p>He squeezed his little sub\u2019s ass, knowing it would hurt, seeing her response in the quivering of her thighs, feeling the way her cunt clutched him.</p><p>The legs-high position made her extremely tight, the tugging of the piercing waking every nerve in his cock. He thrust hard again, letting his body tell her, show her, what he would soon say to her. Mine. Mine to possess, to protect, to push, to cherish. To love.</p> <p>He pounded into her, slowing to run his hands over her breasts, the nipples puffy now, and each tiny pinch on a peak made her pussy tighten. Her blue, blue eyes stayed on his as he picked up the pace. He wasn\u2019t trying to last. She\u2019d had enough, but they both needed this to complete what they had done here.</p><p>And she felt so hot, so wet, her cunt was still pulsing around him in a lingering orgasm. He pushed in harder, feeling her cervix against the head of his shaft. His balls pulled up tighter, contracting. Just. One. More. Thrust. And then the heat flowed through his shaft so violently, in such intense pleasure, that his hand tightened on her ass, and she squeaked.</p><p>He pulled out and pushed back in, his climax not ending, as if his cock wanted to hold out, to stay inside her. His chest heaved as he fought for air. Sweat trickled down the hollow of his back.</p><p>He looked into her eyes, seeing her utter submission, her joy in giving him pleasure, in giving herself. The tie between them was almost palpable, and he wanted her in his arms so badly he almost shook with the need.</p><p>He kissed her softly and then pulled out with a pang of regret that matched her soft sigh. Moving back, he pressed a quick kiss to her stomach and smiled against the quivering softness.</p><p>Dios, he loved her. And her courage. He hadn\u2019t pulled back. He\u2019d demanded from her what they both needed, and she\u2019d given him...everything. The scene, the sex... Both had answered his worries, made her sure of herself. The connection between them was stronger than ever.</p><p>He smiled. The bridge was built, was open, and ready for traffic.</p><p>After doing up his jeans, he moved to give her a long, long kiss. \u201cI love you, sumisita m\u00eda\u201d he whispered and was surprised when her eyes pooled with tears despite her smile.</p><p>Always touching her, he released the straps, rubbing her skin lightly to help the blood return, massaging her shoulders and hip joints. Finally she struggled to a sitting position.</p><p>The people on the patio were silent, not wanting to interrupt. Raoul glanced their way. Cullen grinned, his little sub obviously riding him; Marcus had Gabi in front of him and his hand in her shorts. Raoul\u2019s lips twitched. Must have been as hot from the outside as it was from the inside.</p><p>Z moved Jessica off his own lap, picked up a tightly rolled blanket from the table beside him, and walked over to hand it to Kimberly.</p><p>She started to unfold it, and Z shook his head, so she wrapped her arms around the bundle. He touched her cheek lightly with his fingertips, smiled at Raoul, and returned to his sub.</p><p>With a sigh of pleasure, Raoul gathered up his woman, soft and warm and fragrant, fitting...just right...in his arms. After kissing the top of her head, he carried her across the patio, down the steps, and onto the beach.</p><p>He went to her favorite spot, the weathered white Adirondack chair. As he settled her against him with a sigh of contentment, she buried her face in his neck, starting to tremble.</p><p>The aftermath was catching up with her.</p><p>With his arms around her, he awkwardly unfolded the blanket Z had given her and found a bottle of water, a tube of ointment...and his collar. Clever dom. After setting everything to the side of the chair, he wrapped her in the thin blanket then pulled her closer. He still felt so in tune with her that he knew when she started to unravel.</p><p>She looked up at him, her expression vulnerable, everything open to his gaze. \u201cI missed you so much,\u201d she whispered. \u201cAnd I was lonely.\u201d Her eyes filled with tears.</p><p>He stroked her cheek, recognizing her need. \u201cCry for me now, Kimberly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCry for me.\u201d A dom\u2019s command. Kim stared into his face. He was here, really here, and she hurt, and everything inside her felt as if he\u2019d ripped away all the bandages over her emotions, and he was really here. A sob wrenched out of her, a belated sound since tears already streamed down her face. She buried her face in his neck, breathed him in, and cried.</p><p>Cried for the weeks apart and for missing him and for his gift of a furry protector. For him losing his family and finding them again, and for her fear of today and the whip, and because her back hurt like hell, and eventually, she realized she was telling him all that in between her sobs.</p><p>He\u2019d laid his cheek on top of her head and was murmuring encouragement, Spanish mingling with English.</p><p>After a shuddering breath, she looked up. His eyes crinkled, and he dug a cotton handkerchief from his jeans pocket. A handkerchief.</p><p>As she wiped her face, she muttered, \u201cYou knew this would happen. I cry way too much around you. I never used to cry at all, so this is all your fault.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, low and pleased, knocking her heart over as if it had tripped. \u201cBut no, gatita, I think you\u2019re making up for lost time. Eventually it will settle down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne can only hope.\u201d She gave him a soft kiss, enjoying the slow movement of his mouth on hers. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his nose against hers and then resettled her on his lap before holding a bottle of water to her lips. After she\u2019d finished most of it, he wrapped the blanket back around her.</p><p>With a finger under her chin, he asked, \u201cKimberly, did you have anything to do with my mother and sister visiting me this morning?\u201d</p><p>She jerked and realized she\u2019d given herself away. Oh damn. Her turn.</p><p>Gabi and Jessica had already gotten in trouble. That nasty Cullen had called Z and Marcus and told on them. Talk about pissed-off doms. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But how would Master R react? His expression didn\u2019t tell her anything. She bit her lip. \u201cUm.\u201d</p><p>He nodded as if her hesitance totally confirmed his suspicions. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She huffed out a breath. Dammit. \u201cIn the hospital, your family warned me about you, saying what you\u2019d supposedly done to your ex, only...that\u2019s just not you. It bothered me. Worried me. Last night, I, uh, checked around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asked Sally.\u201d</p><p>Whip or not, I\u2019m not going to confirm that. \u201cAfter I finished my research\u201d\u2014that sounded nicely vague\u2014\u201cI talked with your mom and sister, and now they know Alicia is a liar and a bottom-feeding, skanky bilge rat who slept with her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKimberly.\u201d</p><p>Kimberly broke it off\u2014the scum-sucking bitch\u2014and sweetly added, \u201cI simply explained what consensual means.\u201d</p><p>Raoul shook his head. It had been the gatita who\u2019d fixed everything.</p><p>All these years, alienated from his family because of a vindictive woman\u2019s lies. He frowned. \u201cI wonder if Alicia spread those lies in the BDSM community.\u201d Not in the Shadowlands, since Z was a walking lie detector, but elsewhere.</p><p>\u201cShe sounds like she\u2019s enough of a blowfish.\u201d Kimberly frowned. \u201cThe Overseer always acted like he thought you were like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably why I was accepted as a buyer so quickly. And why I was there to buy you that night.\u201d His arms tightened. Kimberly might have been bought and disappeared forever. Any buyers not picked up at the auction would hide their slaves forever...or dispose of them.</p><p>One little submissive in exchange for three years of not speaking to his family. His lips curved. Maybe he\u2019d send his ex a thank-you note.</p><p>Kimberly was biting her lip again, still worried about her interference in his life, his generous-hearted gatita who had healed a wound that had lasted far too long. He ran his finger over her cheek. \u201cThank you, mi amor.\u201d</p><p>Her soft lips turned up in a happy smile. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d She gave him a mischievous look. \u201cYour sister called before we left Gabi\u2019s house\u2014I\u2019m supposed to come to Sunday dinner with you.\u201d</p><p>As Master R laughed and hugged her, Kim sighed in relief. In perfect contentment, she lay in his arms, listening to the waves roll in and the sound of gulls in the distance. Even the voices from the party up the shore didn\u2019t disturb her\u2014she was part of them. \u201cSo did I pass the test?\u201d</p><p>He ran his finger over her lips. \u201cYou know you did. Before we go further, do you have questions, some negotiating?\u201d</p><p>Oh. Hmm . She\u2019d worried over so many things, and somehow most of them no longer seemed that important. \u201cWill I live with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019d move here and get a job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to keep working?\u201d He kissed her. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to.\u201d She wrinkled her nose. \u201cHousework is past boring.\u201d</p><p>His laugh bounced her head on his chest. \u201cThis is your decision, gatita. And, before you ask, your money is also your own. I have enough trouble with my own finances.\u201d</p><p>Her breath eased out. \u201cYou\u2019re being awfully easygoing.\u201d Disappointment, worry tightened her chest. Wasn\u2019t he going to stay in charge?</p> <p>\u201cNow and then. I\u2019m also making one very big concession, chiquita,\u201d he murmured. \u201cYou will have a small part of the day to call your own...although I may take that away eventually.\u201d Master R considered her, his eyes narrowing. \u201cYou like rules and schedules, so...in the morning, from arising until noon\u2014or at your job\u2014you are in charge of yourself.\u201d</p><p>One worry...of being constantly monitored ...disappeared. But...I want him in charge.</p><p>\u201cThe rest of the time, you submit completely to me,\u201d Master R said. He leaned forward, holding her eyes. \u201cFor sex, for clothing, for food and exercise. As we lived before. You are mine.\u201d</p><p>Her breath huffed out as the tightness in her chest eased into warmth.</p><p>His hand fisted in her hair, pulling her head back so she stared up at him. The love in his eyes did not conceal the determination, the sheer steel of his character. \u201cThat is the point, is it not, chiquita?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her so thoroughly that she felt owned right down to her soul and beyond, then smiled, a wicked gleam in his eyes. \u201cLunch has been and gone, so this is my time, no?\u201d</p><p>A tremor went through her as amusement lit his eyes. Uh-oh. \u201cYes, Master R.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLie across my knees.\u201d</p><p>A spanking. Her back and bottom still burned from the whipping and flogging. But...but. From the look on his face, she knew better than to beg for lenience. \u201cYes, Master.\u201d Slowly, as if maybe he\u2019d change his mind\u2014had that happened yet?\u2014she went stomach down over his lap. \u201cGood girl. Now hold still.\u201d</p><p>She tensed. Something cold drizzled over her skin.</p><p>Ointment, she realized, and then his ruthless, hard hand rubbed it over her back and bottom. Ouch, ouch, ouch. Unable to help herself, she squirmed.</p><p>\u201cStay still.\u201d He set a heavy hand on her lower back to pin her like a bug as he treated every stripe and welt and sore spot. Every damned one. He ignored her wiggling and whimpers\u2014and actually laughed a few times. Sadistic bastard dom.</p><p>When he finally finished, everything throbbed with pain. He set her on her feet, rose, and with a grin, lifted her chin to kiss her sullen lips. \u201cI take good care of this little body that is mine, no?\u201d</p><p>His good humor was contagious, and her mouth curved up as she grumbled out, \u201cThank you, Master.\u201d</p><p>He picked something up, then turned toward the patio and gave a shrill whistle.</p><p>She saw he held the collar in his hand. Oh my God. He was really going to do it.</p><p>The Shadowlands people gathered quietly along the edge of the patio. Kim saw a teary-eyed Gabi holding Marcus\u2019s hand. Jessica was tucked under Z\u2019s arm, and the Shadowlands owner was smiling. Andrea and Cullen had equally big grins. Dan with Kari wiping tears from her cheeks. On left end of the line, Sally beamed. On the right of line, the FBI agents had satisfaction in their faces. Sam\u2019s eyes met hers. He nodded, his expression pleased and a little haunted.</p><p>And the rest of the people... She knew she\u2019d have time to get to know them all. Unable to show how happy she was, she could only grin up at everyone.</p><p>Then she turned to Master R. Her heart hammered in her chest as it had done so often this past month, only her hands were warm, her lips were curved in a smile, and her body wasn\u2019t filled with fear, but joy.</p><p>He glanced at the ground.</p><p>She knelt with perfect grace and bowed her head.</p><p>He raised his voice. \u201cKimberly, I promise to hold you and keep you safe, to support you and guide you, to be honest and open with you. You have trusted me to tend to your happiness, health, and well-being. I will never break that trust.\u201d His voice was rough, his eyes so, so warm. He held up the collar, the engraving gleaming in the sunlight. \u201cDo you accept this collar as a symbol of your submission and devotion?\u201d</p><p>She wanted special words to give him back but could only manage, \u201cI will wear it proudly.\u201d</p><p>He touched the buckle. \u201cThe lock is missing. At the beginning of the new year, if we are of the same mind, then we will have a formal collaring\u2014and locking\u2014ceremony.\u201d</p><p>Under the murmuring of approval, he whispered in an amused voice, \u201cThat means I\u2019ll get to whip you again.\u201d</p><p>She choked, trying not to laugh. Relief mingled with joy. He understood that her mind and emotions weren\u2019t as yet all her own, and would give her time to finish healing, to let her enter into a formal relationship with a whole heart.</p><p>He fastened the collar around her neck, checking that it was loose enough, and the feeling of belonging shook her whole body. His eyes crinkled. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly the right reaction, sumisita m\u00eda,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>When tipping over backward into the ocean during a scuba dive, she\u2019d always have a moment of disorientation before everything turned clear and the ocean turned to an embrace. She\u2019d plunged, and now here she was, right where she wanted to be. \u201cMaster, have I mentioned how much I love you?\u201d</p><p>To the sound of applause, he lifted Kim to her feet, his hands warm and firm on her arms. His eyes met hers, serious, burning with his own love. \u201cNot nearly often enough. Please work on that, sumisita m\u00eda. \u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be my pleasure, Master.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
