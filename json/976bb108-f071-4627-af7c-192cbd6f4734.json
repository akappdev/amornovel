She didn\u2019t go inside\u2014she would do that later. She just wanted to see if the view from this perch matched the pictures she\u2019d been sent. She let out her breath, not even realizing she\u2019d been holding it. The vista before her was even better.</p><p>What am I doing here? she asked herself again. She\u2019d been asking herself over three thousand miles of driving.</p><p>The view was stunning. The beach was wide and long. The huge, black haystack rocks were a powerful contrast against the gray-blue water. The mouth of the bay lay between two promontories, the Pacific stretching endlessly beyond, crashing against the giant rocks, but the water in the bay was calm.</p> <p>She shivered in the cold and pulled her jacket tighter. It was late January and the damp cold caused her right shoulder to ache all the way to her elbow. She\u2019d had surgery on that shoulder three months ago. A bullet was removed and damage repaired. Maybe it was the bullet that brought her to Thunder Point. Laine had been wounded on the job, then pulled from FBI field service and put on a desk while recovering. She wasn\u2019t given any active cases but she had a computer\u2014she was limited to what amounted to research and clerical work for other agents. When she realized they were going to keep her on that desk for a long time, light duty, assisting rather than leading investigations, she requested a one-year leave of absence to focus on rehab.</p><p>Rehab was an excuse. She didn\u2019t need a year. She was close to seventy-five-percent total recovery of the shoulder and in another six months she\u2019d be a hundred percent. But even though she was cleared for duty by the shrink, she wanted time to rethink her career path. And she was allergic to that full-time desk.</p><p>Plus, she\u2019d had a miserable holiday visit with her father in Boston. She left angry, went back to her Virginia town house, got in touch with a Realtor in Thunder Point, where she knew a couple of people, and from emailed photos she had chosen a house to rent. A house with a view of the bay. Because Thunder Point, Oregon, was just about as far from Boston as she could get.</p><p>Her car was in the parking lot of the bar and she leaned against the hood for a long time, staring at the sea. It was overcast and cold, and there was no one on the water. It was glum, actually. But she liked cloudy or stormy days. Her mother used to call them soup days. Although her mother had been a career woman, she had loved to cook and bake and it was particularly on days like this that she\u2019d come home from her office or the hospital early, arms filled with grocery bags, and spend a few hours in the kitchen. It relaxed her. She loved filling her family with comfort food\u2014thick soups and stews, hearty casseroles, pastas in rich sauces and sweet, soft breads.</p><p>Laine sighed. She would never get over losing her mother. It had been five years and she still reached for the phone. Then she\u2019d remember. She\u2019s gone.</p> <p>It was time to get to town to meet the Realtor. She got in her car, drove out of the parking lot and took the road that crossed the beach and led to the town. There was some construction on the hill\u2014it looked like a few houses were being built on this beachfront hillside. Like Cooper\u2019s bar, they would have the best views in the town.</p><p>She drove to the main street and parked in front of the clinic. When she got out of her car she locked it out of habit. She looked up and down the street lined with lampposts still boasting a bit of Christmas garland. Well, it was only January, she thought with a private chuckle.</p><p>Laine walked into the clinic and there, sitting behind the counter at her desk, was Devon McAllister. She rose with a wide smile on her face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here,\u201d Devon said in a near whisper. She came around the counter and embraced Laine. \u201cThere was a part of me afraid you wouldn\u2019t come. That something would happen, that the FBI would have work for you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we please not say a lot about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what? The commune? The raid? The FBI?\u201d</p> <p>Laine couldn\u2019t help herself, she brushed the hair back from Devon\u2019s pretty face as if she were a little sister. Laine had taken Devon under her wing in the commune. \u201cAbout all of it,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen people find out I work for the FBI they either ask me a ton of weird questions or they get strange, like they\u2019re worried I\u2019m going to do a background check on them or something. At least until I settle in a little bit, let\u2019s downplay all that stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will you say? Because these people want to know everything about everyone. They\u2019re nice about it, but they will ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just say I worked on a federal task force, but most of my work was just at a desk, compiling data, research, that sort of thing. Not at all a lie. And I\u2019m on leave because of shoulder surgery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Devon said, laughing softly. \u201cThey really don\u2019t need to know your task force was counterterrorism until you stumbled on an illegal pot farm in the middle of a cult and that you had shoulder surgery because you were shot in the line of duty.\u201d Then she grinned.</p><p>Laine groaned. \u201cPlease, I really don\u2019t want to sound that interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the only people who know certain details were there that night and they were briefed pretty thoroughly. Rawley, Cooper and Spencer will be very happy to see you,\u201d Devon said. \u201cAnd of course Mac knows\u2014he\u2019s the law around here, can\u2019t get anything by him. I told Scott, my boss, but I can keep him quiet. He\u2019s pretty easy to control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d Laine asked with a smile.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d she said. \u201cIn Dr. Grant\u2019s case it has more to do with me being happy so I can keep track of all the paperwork in this clinic. He dreads things like insurance filing, especially Medicaid and Medicare. He does it when he has to and frankly, it takes him five times as long as it takes me. He\u2019s not even very good at keeping lab work and patient files up to date.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re so different from the person I knew on the farm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I was different in the commune from the person I really am,\u201d Devon said. \u201cThis is more me. I was always a good student, a hard worker. But you are the curiosity. How did a sophisticated city girl like you manage to fit into the family like you did?\u201d</p><p>Laine smiled, secretly proud. \u201cSpecialized training, research, good role-playing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that working for a couple of days, but it was over six months!\u201d Devon reminded her.</p><p>She knew. Only too well. \u201cVery good research and role-playing,\u201d she said. Not to mention the fact that lives were at stake and rested on her success or failure. Laine had done a lot of undercover work over the years but her time with The Fellowship had been the longest deep-cover assignment in her career. She had requested it, thinking it would be a brief fact-finding assignment. She thought she could probably fit in, get to the bottom of what was happening there, but what was going on was quite different than what the FBI suspected. They had been looking for evidence of sovereign citizenry, tax evasion, fraud, human trafficking and possible domestic terrorism. What she found, once she was inside, was a giant pot farm fronted by a fake cult.</p><p>Laine could have left then, escaped, turned her information over to the task force and let them figure out how to proceed, how to best serve a warrant and get inside to make arrests without creating a small war. But there were women and children behind the fence that surrounded The Fellowship and the men in charge would fight back\u2014they were armed to the teeth. So she stayed, getting as many of them out safely as she could before law enforcement breached the compound. It had been a dangerous and complex operation and in the end, she\u2019d been shot by the cult leader, the boss. Jacob.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to have a little quiet now?\u201d Devon asked.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea,\u201d Laine said. But she\u2019d never actually had quiet before. The thought of whole days without plans stretching out in front of her was intimidating.</p><p>\u201cI saw it,\u201d Devon said. \u201cThe house you rented.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRay Anne, the Realtor I suggested to you, told me which house it was and I peeked in some windows. It\u2019s beautiful. So beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve only seen pictures,\u201d Laine replied. \u201cI understand I was very lucky\u2014that there\u2019s hardly ever rental property available around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least not real pretty rental property. This is a vacation home that for some reason the family isn\u2019t going to be using for a while so they\u2019re renting it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know them? The people who own it?\u201d</p><p>Devon shook her head. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t been here that long. I don\u2019t know everyone, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p><p>Laine looked at her watch. \u201cI better go meet Ray Anne. Want to come? See the inside from the inside?\u201d</p><p>She grinned and nodded. \u201cLet me check with Scott, then I\u2019ll follow you so I can come right back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I better follow you,\u201d Laine said. \u201cI haven\u2019t even looked in the windows yet.\u201d</p><p>Devon led the way to Laine\u2019s rental. They drove down the main street, past what seemed to amount to the entire commercial district of Thunder Point, took a left and entered a residential neighborhood. A woman who appeared altogether too dressed up exited her BMW in front of a very small house that sat in the middle of about a dozen nondescript houses. The foliage and pines surrounding the little house were deep green even though it was the dead of winter. Virginia or Boston at this time of year would be covered with snow and the trees bare.</p><p>Laine was a little shocked at how ordinary and dumpy the little house looked; she had never seen a picture of the front exposure. It seemed very small. There was an ordinary white door with a diamond-shaped window in it and one front window. If this were her house she\u2019d paint the door dark green and add identically colored shutters to that window.</p><p>Laine parked, got out and stretched a hand toward the Realtor. \u201cMs. Dysart?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cCall me Ray Anne. So nice to finally meet you, Laine.\u201d She dangled house keys. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to love this. Please, do the honors.\u201d</p><p>With Ray Anne close on her tail and Devon following, Laine stepped into the small house and entered a whole new world. Right inside the front door was a spacious foyer and the house opened up before her. To her left, an open staircase and small powder room, to her right, a small and unfurnished room with louvered double doors, perfect for Laine to use as an office. Straight ahead was a great room with a large picture window. To the left of the great room was a big open kitchen with a dining area in front of a matching window. Dividing the two windows were French doors that Ray Anne immediately opened, revealing a very large deck and a view of the bay that just about knocked Laine out. She inhaled deeply, appreciatively. She walked outside to the railing and looked down\u2014the deck sat atop a rocky hill.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t get to the beach from here,\u201d Ray Anne said from behind her. \u201cThere really isn\u2019t much beach\u2014only a little when the tide\u2019s out. You\u2019ll have to go down the street and back through town to the marina. This is considered oceanfront. The only beachfront in Thunder Point is over there, where Cooper is building. Most of us thought there would never be any building there, but Cooper has a plan for maybe as many as twenty single-family residences. The rest of us po\u2019 folk have to get to the beach either from his bar or the marina. This is the north promontory. Straight across there, that\u2019s the south promontory. The previous owner, the guy who left it to Cooper in his will, had always wanted it to be a nature preserve, safe for the wildlife. Much as I\u2019d like him to cut it up and let me sell lots for him, you have to admit it\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeautiful,\u201d Laine said in a breath. A few trees growing right out of the rocks and hillside below her deck reached up so that their branches brushed the railing. They needed trimming so they wouldn\u2019t obstruct her view. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so wet and cold right now I didn\u2019t uncover the grill or deck furniture. I thought I\u2019d leave that to you. You might not want to sit outside in this weather.\u201d</p><p>Laine looked around for the first time. It looked like she had a table and four chairs, a chaise and a rather large grill under the weatherproof drapes. Laine turned and went inside again, taking note of the great room, divided from the kitchen by a breakfast bar. The pictures had done the interior more credit than it deserved. There was a maroon sofa, two uncomfortable-looking rattan chairs, a nice fireplace and zero homey touches. The breakfast nook held a beat-up but large table with eight cane-back chairs. There was a short hall that led to a laundry room, pantry and interior garage door.</p> <p>\u201cBedroom?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cRight this way,\u201d Ray Anne said, leading her back toward the front door and up the stairs. Laine and Devon followed along. At the top of the stairs was a set of double doors that stood open to expose a rather small but comfortable-looking master bedroom. Not a suite, but a bedroom. One queen-size bed, one bureau, one bedside table and a fireplace. But it had a triple-wide set of sliding glass doors and a small deck again with the most stunning view. Laine was drawn to it. Her eyes nearly rolled back in her head at a vision of sitting against big pillows, looking out the window at the clouds, only the fireplace lighting the room.</p><p>Falling asleep with the light of the fireplace in the room held a special appeal. Since the shooting, she\u2019d left a light on at night. She never told anyone.</p><p>\u201cWhen the weather gets exciting, watching the lightning over the bay is like a fireworks show,\u201d Ray Anne said. \u201cAround here, it\u2019s all about the view. There are a lot of views in this town. Some have the view in front, some in back, some up the hill, some closer to the water, sometimes from big houses and sometimes from little ones.\u201d Ray Anne stepped to one side. \u201cBath,\u201d she said, indicating a very functional master bath, dressing area and closet. There was a glassed-in shower, large spa-style tub and wide closet with built-in drawers and shelves.</p><p>Laine merely glanced, then her eyes were drawn back to that view again. Devon was oohing and aahing over the size of the master bath and closet space.</p> <p>\u201cThere are two bedrooms down the hall with a jack-and-jill bathroom dividing them. The owner has queen-size beds in each. Storage is limited. They\u2019re small bedrooms but the sofa downstairs pulls out\u2014the house can sleep at least eight. The owners wanted a place for their children and grandchildren to visit. Linen closet across the hall from the master. Downstairs front closet under the stairs. You have a two-car garage,\u201d Ray Anne said as she continued the tour.</p><p>And only a few rather tacky prints on the walls, no little touches of home, no plants, of course, and the lamps had been around a long time, Laine thought.</p><p>\u201cI had a cleaning crew come through\u2014the carpet is shampooed, bathrooms and kitchen scoured, clean sheets on the beds, some towels on hand. The carpet is fairly new. I don\u2019t know what your plans are for the house, but it will accommodate a large group.\u201d</p><p>Laine looked at her in some surprise. \u201cMy plan is to live in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! Wonderful! Are you planning to work around here?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll probably do a little computer work. I\u2019m actually on leave from a government job but I can do some work from here\u2014you know, clerical stuff. I had a pretty serious shoulder surgery and with all my vacation and good benefits and\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI hope it wasn\u2019t rotator cuff,\u201d Ray Anne said, moving her own shoulder up and down. \u201cThat\u2019s the worst! I had that surgery a few years ago and it\u2019s hell, that\u2019s all I can say. It\u2019s fine now but I thought it would take forever!\u201d</p><p>Devon met Laine\u2019s eyes, but didn\u2019t comment. She just stood in the master bedroom and looked out at the rock-studded bay.</p><p>Laine was thinking about other things, like what the place would feel like with a nicer sofa, with a throw on it for winter nights in front of the fire. And how about some accent tables, designer lighting, paintings on the walls, books on her own bookshelves? Her own sheets and towels and some of her favorite cookware and dishes? And her mother\u2019s small kitchen breakfront, her treasure.</p><p>She turned to Ray Anne. \u201cDid you ask the owners if they mind that I store their furnishings and use my own? Of course I\u2019ll cover the cost of packing, moving and storing their things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey said that\u2019s fine as long as their things aren\u2019t damaged.\u201d Ray Anne shrugged. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine how they\u2019d ever know if anything was damaged. This stuff is adequate but old. In fact, as long as you pay your deposit and rent on time and put the place back the way you found it when your lease is up, there are hardly any restrictions in your lease. You should read it over. You can paint as long as you either stick to the colors or return it to the original.\u201d She wrinkled her nose. \u201cWhich appears to be renter\u2019s white. No knocking out walls or redesigning the property.\u201d Then she lowered her voice as if to tell a secret. \u201cIf you paint some walls, which I would do before nightfall, try not to make them too bold so you\u2019re able to return them to their original color when you move out.\u201d</p><p>But Laine could only think of one thing. \u201cLet\u2019s go take a look at that kitchen, see what the owners left for me to use until my stuff comes. The moving truck is on the way\u2014should be here in a day or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Ray Anne said, \u201cbut there are plenty of places in town where you can get a bite to eat until you get settled.\u201d</p><p>Laine was already on her way to the kitchen and when she got there, she started opening cupboard doors. She found plates, a few pots, a frying pan, utensils, some kitchen linens, just the bare essentials, designed for a vacation rental. But that was all right. She closed the last cupboard door, turned and smiled at Ray Anne and Devon. \u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you could just give me directions to the nearest grocery, I\u2019m going to light the fire and make soup. It looks like a soup day to me.\u201d</p> <p>Eric Gentry sat at the counter in the diner having a late breakfast. Next to him was Cooper from the beach bar, doing the same. Then the sheriff\u2019s deputy walked in. Mac pulled off his hat and took the seat beside Eric. Mac\u2019s wife, Gina, brought him a cup of coffee. Then she leaned over the counter and collected a kiss.</p><p>\u201cI certainly didn\u2019t get that kind of first-class treatment,\u201d Cooper said with a smile. \u201cAnd I ordered a whole meal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, buddy, the day I hear about you getting treatment like that is the day you start walking with a limp.\u201d</p><p>Eric chuckled, but he\u2019d never make such a remark. He and Gina had history. And he liked walking straight.</p><p>\u201cMac,\u201d Gina chided with a laugh in her voice.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here, anyway?\u201d Mac asked Cooper. \u201cGet sick of Rawley\u2019s cooking out at the bar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRawley doesn\u2019t cook,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cSometimes he warms things, but that\u2019s just sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSarah says he\u2019s a good cook,\u201d Gina pointed out.</p><p>\u201cOh, he cooks for Sarah,\u201d Cooper said of his wife. \u201cWhen she wanders into the kitchen he asks her right away what she\u2019d like. Now that she\u2019s packin\u2019, Rawley takes real good care of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPackin\u2019?\u201d Eric asked.</p><p>\u201cPregnant,\u201d three people answered in unison.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d he said, sitting back and wiping his mouth on the napkin.</p><p>\u201cBusiness must be good,\u201d Mac said to Eric. \u201cI saw a dually pulling a trailer through town, an old Plymouth on the trailer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA 1970 Superbird,\u201d Eric told him. \u201cIt\u2019s in for a rebuilt engine, new bench seat and a refurbished dash. I think we\u2019re going to have to refresh that roof, too. It\u2019s the original vinyl and not going to be easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBench seat? Not buckets?\u201d</p><p>Eric shook his head. \u201cNot in the Superbird. I guess if you drove one of those you got girls and if you got girls, you wanted them sitting right next to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d it come from?\u201d Mac asked.</p><p>\u201cSouthern California.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone would bring an old car up from Southern California?\u201d</p><p>Eric sipped his coffee. \u201cIt\u2019s a two-hundred-thousand-dollar classic. The owner would bring it across six states for the right work. I\u2019ve done a lot of work for him. He owns twenty cars. I think it\u2019s most of his estate. He likes to do a lot of the restoration work himself and he does a great job. He doesn\u2019t have the equipment for replacing an engine block and the car is his baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis baby?\u201d Gina asked.</p><p>\u201cHe kisses it before he goes to bed every night. He probably treats the car better than he treats his wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoys and their toys,\u201d Gina said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re putting us on the map,\u201d Mac said. \u201cImagine\u2014that car is worth more than this diner.\u201d</p><p>Eric noticed a couple of young women walking across the street from the clinic. One he knew to be Devon, the doctor\u2019s office manager\u2014he\u2019d met her a couple of months ago and had seen her around. The other one he didn\u2019t recognize. She was wearing a ball cap low over her forehead and fitted yoga pants, a jacket and running shoes. Her blond hair was strung through the back of her cap, noticeable when she turned to laugh at something Devon said.</p><p>When they walked into the diner Gina beamed a happy grin and said, \u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Devon asked. \u201cGrumpy old men\u2019s club?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon,\u201d Cooper replied. \u201cI\u2019m not old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s older than me,\u201d Mac said.</p><p>Eric said nothing. His eyes were busy with the new girl and when something like that happened it tended to tie up his tongue.</p><p>\u201cLaine, you know Cooper and Mac, but have you met Eric? Eric owns the service station and body shop at the end of the street. Eric, this is my friend, Laine Carrington. She\u2019s new in town.\u201d</p><p>Eric found himself on his feet. \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you,\u201d she replied. \u201cPlease, sit. We\u2019re just going to grab a cup of coffee.\u201d She looked at Gina. \u201cYou due for a break?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll bring the coffee.\u201d</p><p>As Devon and Laine headed toward the back of the diner to a booth, Eric followed them with his eyes. Then he guiltily returned his eyes to his coffee cup, grateful to note that Cooper and Mac were discussing how much money was too much to spend on a car. A two-hundred-thousand-dollar Superbird didn\u2019t even enter the conversation.</p><p>Eric had a couple of classics, cars he\u2019d restored himself. He\u2019d salvaged them and had planned to restore and sell them, then he got attached. It happened. There were dealers and then there were collectors. Then there were guys like him who were looking to make a few bucks and turned into collectors.</p><p>He talked with his friends for a while longer, forcefully keeping his eyes from wandering to that back booth, until finally Mac stood and left the waitress a tip, making the men laugh. Cooper left a ten on the counter for his seven-dollar breakfast.</p><p>But Eric walked to the back booth. \u201cGina, I\u2019m going to need some change. You\u2019re good, but not that good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d argue with that, but it will be quicker to get your change.\u201d She snatched the twenty out of his hand and headed for the register.</p><p>\u201cNice meeting you, Laine. If you ever need any dents popped or rough edges smoothed out, I\u2019m your guy,\u201d he said. When he saw Laine and Devon looking at him with wide eyes, he winced. But the women laughed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind,\u201d she said.</p><p>Two</p><p>Even though Laine needed help with the heavy lifting and some of the picture-hanging in her new home, it didn\u2019t take any time at all to begin to feel settled. She had learned long ago how to be extremely focused. In less than a week all her furniture was in place right down to throws over couches and pictures on the walls, thanks to a lot of help from Devon and her fianc\u00e9, Spencer. The owner\u2019s furnishings were now in storage, packed up and taken away on the same truck that brought hers. She had picked out a couple of walls she wanted to paint and purchased the supplies. Despite the challenge painting with her right arm presented, she was determined to get it done. She could handle most of the trim if it was shoulder level or lower, but reaching the roller above her head would be a job for her left arm. She was getting really good with that left arm! She\u2019d try using her right arm, though\u2014it was great therapy. She was very dedicated to her exercises. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>This place was going to be different\u2014she was going to make this home. Her town house in Virginia was where she stayed. Although she had her own things\u2014furniture and accessories\u2014in all the years she was there she had only rented the place. She traveled, went undercover, visited her brother and his family on weekends and holidays. Her town house had been temporary for years and she was away as much as she was there. But this\u2014the house with the view\u2014she was going to make it hers. It was going to be her refuge for the year. She had earned it.</p><p>It was Saturday afternoon and the sun was shining for a change. There was one person in Thunder Point she knew and hadn\u2019t yet seen. Someone she really owed. And it looked like a perfect day for a jog through town and across the beach.</p> <p>As she ran, her mind wandered back to that last assignment. She had gotten almost all of the women and children out of the commune compound through a break in the fence, but her success had been completely foiled when Jacob figured her out. He beat her and confined her, tying her to a chair in his house. She was further foiled when Jacob somehow located and abducted Devon\u2019s three-year-old daughter, Mercy, bringing her back to the camp. Later, when it was all over, the FBI learned he had simply done a computer search for Devon\u2019s address.</p><p>At the time, Laine had been his prisoner. So had Mercy. It had been Jacob\u2019s plan to escape with his daughter and whatever money and documents he could gather together. And then he planned to burn the place to the ground, leaving any others, like Laine, behind. He torched the warehouse holding the marijuana plants knowing the fire could spread into a full-on wildfire that would threaten the whole valley\u2014something he no doubt hoped would occupy law enforcement long enough for his escape.</p><p>Laine had managed to free herself and grab Mercy, but in the process she\u2019d been shot in the shoulder. By the time help arrived in the form of Rawley, Spencer, Cooper and Devon, she was nearly unconscious from blood loss\u2014her brachial artery had been nicked.</p><p>Of course Laine had known Devon and Mercy from her time in the camp but she had no idea who these men who saved her might be. She found out later\u2014it was Rawley Goode, a Vietnam vet in his sixties, who put together a rescue plan in mere minutes. Laine got the details after she was conscious and recovered enough to take it all in.</p><p>She jogged across the beach. By the time she got to Cooper\u2019s, she was panting pretty hard. She found the proprietor sitting on the deck in the sun, though he wore a jacket. He had his laptop open and was studying something closely.</p> <p>\u201cHey, there,\u201d she said. \u201cHow\u2019s the house coming?\u201d</p><p>He looked up and smiled at her. \u201cAbout time you checked out my place. House is coming along ahead of schedule, thank God. Sarah\u2019s had about enough of living in one room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s the baby due?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cJuly. We should be in the house by June at the latest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s awesome, Cooper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about your place?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s looking good. My stuff came right behind me and the movers took the owner\u2019s furniture to the storage facility. I\u2019m pretty settled already. Just a matter of putting a few more things away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you have a good view.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. A big deck and a big kitchen and a couple of fireplaces. If I\u2019m not happy every day, I can\u2019t blame the real estate. Hey, any chance Rawley is around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast time I noticed he was carrying in supplies. He should be in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I\u2019ll see you on the way out.\u201d</p><p>She went through the bar and into the kitchen. Rawley was crouched, rearranging some things in a cupboard. \u201cHey, stranger,\u201d she said.</p><p>He stood and turned toward her. He wore worn jeans, boots, a heavy shirt over a T-shirt and a red cap. She knew he was in his early sixties but because he was skinny and his face was deeply lined, he looked a little older. She caught the light in his pale blue eyes as he recognized her. Only one corner of his mouth lifted. He nodded toward her right arm. \u201cHow\u2019s the wing?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cComing along,\u201d she said, automatically rotating her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m in good shape now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he asked. \u201cDon\u2019t you have spy work to do?\u201d</p><p>She smiled, looked down, shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m on leave,\u201d she said. \u201cI need more time before I\u2014\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cI\u2019m not a spy. I...\u201d He smiled at her and put his thumb in the front pocket of his jeans, leaning on his left leg. \u201cWell, not exactly. I\u2019m an investigator. And I think we should downplay that role a little bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you want, chickadee,\u201d he said. \u201cGood work,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cYou saved my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. Not really. I got in that camp to find Mercy. I think it was Spencer saved your life, jogging down some back road, carrying you with his fist shoved against your shoulder on account a\u2019 the bleeding. Yeah, he\u2019s the one I\u2019d say saved you. I\u2019m just an old vet. But I got attached to that little girl and I wasn\u2019t about to let some lunatic take her away from her mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome old vet,\u201d she repeated. \u201cA Green Beret with two Purple Hearts, a Bronze Star and a Silver Star....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWindow dressing,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cIt\u2019s the by-product of staying alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one of the most decorated men I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a bad time, back then, but we all did our best,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a rumor you got yourself a little window dressing, too.\u201d</p><p>She gave a nod. \u201cI\u2019ve been notified. I was recommended for an award. You know these things take time.\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her. \u201cNotified of what kind of award, exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFBI commendation. It\u2019s very big in my crowd. But that\u2019s another thing I\u2019ll try to keep to myself. I\u2019d appreciate it if you\u2019d do that, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem, chickadee. I was never one for struttin\u2019 so I get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to say thank you,\u201d she said. \u201cI know you weren\u2019t alone, but I read all the transcripts and everyone agrees, you put a plan together to get Mercy out, along with anyone else stuck in that camp. Will you come to my house for dinner? So I can thank you with food? I love to cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight could,\u201d he said. \u201cCloudy and wet weather this time of year, Cooper can manage. But I ain\u2019t much company....\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about if I invite Devon, Spencer and Mercy. I\u2019ve been meaning to anyway. They helped a lot with the whole move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds okay.\u201d He reached in his pocket and pulled out a cell phone and showed it to her. \u201cGot one of these now. Cooper couldn\u2019t stand it if he didn\u2019t know where I was every second. Now he calls this. And I usually don\u2019t answer. But it\u2019s got games and books and a flashlight. Not a bad contraption. Want the number?\u201d</p><p>What a kick he was. And he was so full of it\u2014he was not the old bumpkin he portrayed himself to be. He bordered on genius, but he battled PTSD and had for years so he\u2019d never really developed his intellect as much as was possible for him. He told her his number and she merely nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t wanna write that down somewhere?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI got it,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a call. And listen...Rawley, there are no words. If you hadn\u2019t done it, gotten inside, run the rescue like you did...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome things just work out to be kismet, chickadee,\u201d he said, showing her a wide grin. \u201cRight place, right time, luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkill,\u201d she added. \u201cCourage.\u201d</p><p>He looked down, maybe uncomfortably. \u201cCourage. Kind of funny what you\u2019re left with when there ain\u2019t no way out. I just put one foot in front of the other, that\u2019s all. Glad it worked out. You gonna be able to paddle a kayak with that busted-up wing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy spring. I\u2019ll call you in the next day or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good. You ain\u2019t one of them vegetarians or anything, are you?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cNo. I like hearty, meaty meals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a blessin\u2019. I hate leavin\u2019 the table hungry.\u201d Then he grinned at her again.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help herself. She hugged him. She laid her head against his shoulder and wrapped her arms affectionately around him. He might look like a skinny old man but there were solid muscles under her cheek, her arms. She just stood like that for a moment and then she felt him wrap one long, strong arm around her back while the other hand stroked the top of her head a little bit. Then she let go of him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say you were the brave one,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could\u2019a bled out from that bullet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting a medal,\u201d she said. \u201cThe by-product of staying alive.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. It was melancholy.</p><p>\u201cYou lost a few along the way, didn\u2019t you, Rawley?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He lifted a thin, graying eyebrow. \u201cA few. Didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She just nodded, but she wasn\u2019t willing to think about or discuss the details. Ten years in the FBI, a lot of it undercover, they\u2019d lost a couple of men. And then suddenly she knew what he was getting at\u2014he\u2019d rather have the men than the medals.</p><p>She slapped his arm gently. \u201cThanks,\u201d she said. It came out very softly. \u201cI\u2019ll call you about dinner. And you won\u2019t go away hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood enough.\u201d</p><p>She left him then and as she walked through the bar she was thinking that old soldiers go away quietly. It was apparent to her that Rawley had used his time in the Army well, but it had also used him up. True heroes never talked about their acts of heroism. He was one in a million.</p><p>I\u2019ve used my time in the FBI well, she thought.</p><p>When she got back to the deck, Cooper had the laptop closed and his feet up on the rail. \u201cI take it you found him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, thanks.\u201d</p><p>He pushed a bottle of water across the table toward her. \u201cAre you running back to town, too?\u201d</p><p>She took the water and unscrewed the top, taking a drink. \u201cJust across the beach. Then, even though I have \u2018house\u2019 things to do, I\u2019m going to take advantage of this sunny day and sit out on my deck. It\u2019s too cold, but the sun feels good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant some advice? Get yourself one of those little fire pits to put out on the deck. It only gives off a little heat, but it\u2019s cozy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m putting a fireplace on my deck,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cA half shade out there, too\u2014the sunset is not only stunning, it\u2019s blinding. And a half cover. This place is wet, but the view doesn\u2019t let you ignore it\u2014rain or shine, you like being right in front of it. Truth is, I\u2019m building a deck that happens to have a house attached to it.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him. \u201cHow long have you known Rawley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a year and change. He kind of came with the property. Ben found him and brought him here. Ben was my friend and left me the property. Rawley had been with Ben a few years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to have someone working for you who knows the business.\u201d</p><p>Cooper laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t kid yourself that he works for me. He pretty much does as he pleases, checks in as little as possible and if he tells me to do something, I usually do.\u201d He winked at her. \u201cChickadee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it like having your father around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father\u2019s not nearly as ornery, but in that age range,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cRawley is an interesting guy. Real solitary. Real quiet. But he can develop some deep attachments\u2014like to Devon and Mercy. They\u2019re family now. And since Devon doesn\u2019t have any family, that\u2019s good. For that matter, Spencer doesn\u2019t have family, either.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cBut you have family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTons. All in or near Albuquerque. Parents, sisters, brothers-in-law, their kids. Plus, I have a son\u2014Austin. Spencer and I share a son.\u201d Her expression must have been shocked because he smiled and said, \u201cSpencer married my ex-fianc\u00e9e and she passed away last year. How about you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI lost my mother a few years ago, but my father and brother live in Boston. I\u2019m very close to my brother\u2014he\u2019s married and has two little girls I adore, even though in my line of work I haven\u2019t seen enough of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not on the East Coast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI needed a change,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s something about this place.... In the time I lived on the farm, although under adverse conditions, I got a little attached and wanted to see a little more of the state. And there was the matter of getting to know the people who put everything on the line to get me out of that camp. Plus, my brother is a busy, busy man. And now that I have the time, I\u2019ll probably visit him. Long flight, but so what? I talk to my brother at least a couple of times a week. I guess we\u2019re all used to me living away from the family, so to speak. And hey\u2014you\u2019re not in the mountains of New Mexico.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the surprise. I left home when I joined the Army as a kid and haven\u2019t lived there since. The real surprise is that I live here! I was a rolling stone until I came to Thunder Point. Now I\u2019m a land baron.\u201d</p><p>Laine stood on her deck, hands on hips, looking around, when the phone rang. Her cell phone was sitting on the kitchen counter and she went for it. No need for a landline in this house, she only had her cell. When she saw that it was her brother, her face lit up. \u201cPax!\u201d she said. \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI missed two calls from you,\u201d he said. \u201cSorry about that. Busy week. Lots of surgery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo big deal. We have an understanding\u2014first thing after work comes the wife and kids, then me. I\u2019m very patient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it like out there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeat wave,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s fifty degrees and sunny. I was just looking around the deck to find a good spot for a little portable fire pit so I can bundle up and sit out here at night. What\u2019s Mother Nature doing out there?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t watch the news, I guess.\u201d</p><p>In fact she had been obsessed with news of Boston from the weather and current events to the crime. That was where her family was and she thought of them all constantly. But she said, \u201cNot if I can help it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re bracing for a nor\u2019easter. Looking at two feet tonight. Roads and airport will probably shut down and everyone will stay home and watch old movies until the electricity goes out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on call tomorrow night. Tonight I\u2019m watching snow fall and listening to the wind howl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are Missy and Sissy and Miss Perfect?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He let go with a bark of laughter and said, \u201cOne of these days I\u2019m going to slip up and call my wife Miss Perfect and when that happens, I\u2019m selling you out. I swear it. Everyone here is fine. Missy is having her first school concert in six weeks and is practicing the cello day and night\u2014it\u2019s almost as big as she is and sounds like mating season at an elk ranch around here. And Sissy is gearing up for a spring dance recital, which for six-year-old girls should be enchanting. Thank God she didn\u2019t choose a musical instrument or I\u2019d start sleeping at the hospital.\u201d</p><p>His eight-year-old daughter was Melissa, who they called Missy. His six-year-old daughter was Catherine, who they called Sissy for \u201csister.\u201d And his wife, Genevieve, she had secretly named Miss Perfect because she was the ultimate wife and mother. She never complained at all. It was unnatural. Here she was, stuck with a couple of kids, tons of responsibility, a mostly absent husband, and yet she took it on with a contented smile. What the hell was that? Laine wondered. Had she no limits?</p><p>But Genevieve had two sisters and they were all thicker than thieves. She was a dear and good mother, a faithful wife, a dedicated friend, a beloved daughter and a little too domestic and nurturing for Laine\u2019s blood. And she had taken away Laine\u2019s best friend, her twin brother. She was perfectly wonderful to Laine, but Laine had never warmed to her. They weren\u2019t girlfriends. But then not only did Laine have very few girlfriends, but it was also impossible for anyone to be closer to her than Pax.</p><p>\u201cAnd Senior?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe same. You haven\u2019t heard from him, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Frankly I\u2019m not surprised. I told him not to call me until he\u2019s ready to apologize for being such an ass and has something positive to say to me, so I imagine hell will freeze over before I see his name on the caller ID.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou take him too seriously,\u201d Pax said. \u201cLearn to not hear him. Nod, say nothing, do as you please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cYou get away with that. He\u2019s not as critical of your choices....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he is. But I don\u2019t care. He\u2019s not driving my bus. And if you\u2019re honest, you have to admit, no one but you has been driving your bus for a long, long time. Like since you were seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe aggravates me so,\u201d she said. \u201cHe thinks if he opens his mouth it must be gospel and we should all thank him for taking the time and trouble to move his tongue against his teeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get worked up all over again,\u201d Pax counseled. \u201cIt\u2019s over. You moved. I just wish you weren\u2019t so damn far away. Get your computer set up and use Skype with the girls\u2014they miss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t treat you like he does me,\u201d Laine said, unable to let it go yet. \u201cHe\u2019s very proud of you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe thinks I took his advice and became a doctor. I didn\u2019t. I\u2019m doing exactly what I want to do. And he\u2019s still telling me how to work even though he doesn\u2019t know shit about pediatric surgery. I try to tell him as little as possible, but I also never take him seriously. Now tell me what\u2019s new and exciting in your little town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI painted a wall,\u201d she said with a weary sigh. \u201cMostly with my left arm. And I\u2019m going to paint another wall, but I think that\u2019s it. I had to have a friend hang the pictures\u2014this arm isn\u2019t strong yet, especially when reaching over my head. I\u2019ve read three books since I talked to you last Tuesday, today was the first day it was decent enough for a good run, but I swear to God the cold makes the screws in my shoulder throb....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know it\u2019s not the screws....\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeels like it.\u201d</p><p>Laine\u2019s parents were both doctors. Her grandfathers on both sides were doctors. She had two cousins who were doctors. Successful men and women, all. Laine wasn\u2019t the first Carrington or Wescott to choose another profession, but Dr. Paxton Carrington Sr. was appalled when she changed her major from premed to criminal justice. \u201cBelieve me, you don\u2019t want to live in a blue-collar world,\u201d he had said. Blue-collar world? It was almost impossible to get into the FBI without an advanced degree.</p><p>Laine\u2019s mother had said, \u201cYou must find work you feel passionate about. The most important thing in life is finding what gets you up in the morning, what you would do for free, the thing that makes your heart beat. I\u2019m not a doctor because my father was a doctor. And I\u2019m damn sure not a doctor because my husband is one. And I could care less what my children choose to do. Well, if you choose to be homeless drug addicts, I might have an issue....\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut aren\u2019t you more proud of Pax? A premed honor student?\u201d Laine had asked.</p><p>\u201cI look at what\u2019s ahead for you, Laine, and I find it all so exciting, I wish I could live in your skin for just one day!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Dad hates what I\u2019m doing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he? He probably thinks he knows what\u2019s best for you, but I\u2019m here to tell you\u2014you\u2019re the only person who can make this choice. And it doesn\u2019t matter what anyone else wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut admit it, Dad is more proud of Pax!\u201d she had insisted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure about that. What I know for a fact is that Pax is acting on script. He\u2019s doing exactly what your father expected him to do and it\u2019s easier, more comfortable. You, my darling Laine, are a challenge for him.\u201d</p><p>All through college, all through her postgrad program, all through her early years at the FBI, her mother couldn\u2019t wait for her to call, fill her in on all the edgy, interesting stuff she\u2019d worked on or even just knew about.</p><p>Senior had said, \u201cWhat\u2019s that girl thinking? She\u2019s wasting her life on the underworld! The dregs of society!\u201d</p><p>When Laine told her father, over Christmas, that she\u2019d been recommended for a commendation from the FBI for saving lives in the line of duty he had said, \u201cAs if a medal is going to validate you. Doctors save lives every day.\u201d</p><p>And she\u2019d left Boston in an angry huff, vowing she was through with him.</p><p>Laine missed her mother so....</p><p>Eric was grateful every day that he had asked Gina McCain if she\u2019d be comfortable with him living in the small town of Thunder Point because he was in the diner where she worked almost daily. Half the time her husband was also there. Eric and Gina went way back. High school for her, though he had been a dropout. Their relationship had been brief but to both of them, very memorable.</p><p>Eric bought the local service station in October, had spent two months expanding and updating, and for all that time right up to the present he\u2019d been living in the local motel\u2014the Coastline Inn. It wasn\u2019t much, but it was clean and cheap. There was free coffee in the early morning but no restaurant. Only the diner and McDonald\u2019s served breakfast, unless he felt like going all the way across the beach to Cooper\u2019s place. Since he had no time to look for a house or the energy to fix up both a business and a residence, he bought himself a small dormitory-sized refrigerator and a toaster and settled into the motel. He\u2019d walk down to the motel office early in the morning, grab a large coffee and a newspaper, then head to the station. At lunchtime he\u2019d head to the deli or diner for more satisfying food. He wasn\u2019t much for fast food, something he was stuck with more than he liked. Many busy nights he and his employees made do on burgers or pizza.</p><p>He walked into the diner and saw the new girl in town sitting at the counter in front of Gina. She appeared to be finished with breakfast; she looked at him and smiled.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mr. Scratch-and-Dent, just the man I wanted to see!\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWell now, I don\u2019t get that kind of welcome everywhere I go,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI heard you have a great reputation for cosmetic work but I was wondering, how are you under the hood?\u201d</p><p>He raised his eyebrows. It was a great double entendre. He sat down and a cup of coffee instantly appeared. \u201cI was a mechanic before I was a body man,\u201d he said, smiling a small smile.</p><p>Laine laughed at his wordplay. \u201cI have a little work that needs to be done,\u201d she said. \u201cCan I make an appointment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need an appointment. Is the car drivable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. But I just drove it across the country from Virginia and it needs an oil change and everything checked.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019s very tired. Maybe sore.\u201d</p><p>He grinned at that. Only a collector of classics could appreciate an owner who had given her car a gender and possibly a name. \u201cDo you live in the neighborhood?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cLook around, Eric. Everyone lives in the neighborhood.\u201d</p><p>So, she remembered his name. Or, maybe Gina had told her. \u201cRight. Then just bring it by when you won\u2019t need it for a few hours and I\u2019ll get right to it.\u201d To Gina he said, \u201cCan you ask Stu to mess up three eggs with some green chilies and cheddar?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cYou got it.

And are there any home fries back there that Stu hasn\u2019t burned yet?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTell you what, because it\u2019s you, I\u2019ll flip \u2019em over on the grill a couple of times. God knows if he gets his hands on \u2019em, they\u2019ll be charred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a queen,\u201d he said.</p><p>When Gina took Laine\u2019s empty plate and turned to leave, Laine asked Eric, \u201cYou\u2019re here every day?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cAlmost, though. If not for Gina, I\u2019d live on coffee and Pop-Tarts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m new in town, too. I bought the service station and there was so much to do there, opening it under a new banner after a remodel, I\u2019ve been staying in the Coastline, which makes the Motel 6 look like a five-star luxury resort. One of these days I have to get serious about a house or apartment. It\u2019s so easy, though. And I like walking to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA car man who likes to walk...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have plenty of other places to drive. Even though we\u2019re operating at full speed, I\u2019m still busy upgrading the station. The previous owner didn\u2019t do any body work, and that takes space. I have a pretty large classic-car clientele.\u201d He took a sip of coffee. \u201cWhat do you do, Laine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoulder exercises,\u201d she said. \u201cI had shoulder surgery about three months ago and it\u2019s a lot better, but I\u2019m not there yet. I decided to take a leave from work and try a new landscape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t work at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m set up to do computer work, but I\u2019m avoiding it. I just did research\u2014you know, boring stuff. Data, statistics, background checks, tax records, that kind of stuff...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor a big company?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, the biggest company. The Feds.\u201d Then she grinned at him.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds really...boring.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI know. I\u2019m sadly good at it. But if anyone from my old department calls me and asks for a hand, they have to clock me in, pay me in comp time. I did a little math\u2014I think I can turn a few months of rehab and vacation into a year off with a view just by doing a little off-site work from home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dated a woman a while ago who created and managed websites and she hardly ever left the computer....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not that girl, I can tell you that. I have no trouble walking away from the computer. And leaving the headquarters meant no more traveling or supervising anyone. I really didn\u2019t love supervising or training computer techies and researchers. I might come up with a new idea for earning a living during the next year.\u201d</p><p>With an elbow on the counter, Eric leaned his head into his hand. \u201cHow are you with a wrench?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than you think.\u201d</p> <p>Gina brought his breakfast.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you eat,\u201d Laine said. \u201cI\u2019ll bring my car over one day this week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d he said. And he watched her walk out the door.</p><p>When he turned back, Gina was staring at him. \u201cDid you ask her out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou obviously want to.\u201d</p><p>He picked up his fork. \u201cYou don\u2019t know that,\u201d he said, then shoveled eggs into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cThose pretty green eyes of yours lit up when you saw her sitting at the counter.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed. \u201cI can still appreciate a good-looking woman,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m very busy these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should make time for a more interesting social life than catching meals at the diner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not completely comfortable talking to you about that possibility since you and I were...you know what we were. Involved.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and her eyes twinkled. \u201cWe were involved for about two weeks and I hope you don\u2019t take this too hard, but I\u2019m completely over you. I was over you at least fifteen years ago.\u201d</p><p>He ate more eggs. \u201cIt was more than two weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m over you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know. So...how about Laine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBugger off,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cShe seems to be a nice, stable, attractive\u2014\u201d</p><p>The door to the diner opened and Gina\u2019s husband came in for his morning coffee break. He was all uniformed up, gun and all, and although Eric was roughly as tall as Mac, law enforcement uniforms always seemed to take about four inches off his height. Mac leaned over the counter to collect a wifely kiss. Then his coffee appeared.</p><p>\u201cGood, you\u2019re here,\u201d Eric said. \u201cYour wife is getting into my personal life. She\u2019s giving me dating advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dating?\u201d Mac asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, which is why I shouldn\u2019t have to listen to dating advice.\u201d</p><p>Mac raised one eyebrow and peered at Eric. Then he lifted his cup. He was a man of few words.</p><p>\u201cYou should see his eyes when he runs into Laine. Bip, bop, whiz! And smile? Oh, she makes him smile,\u201d Gina said.</p><p>\u201cBugger off,\u201d Eric said again. And Gina laughed while Mac chuckled into his coffee cup.</p><p>\u201cYou should be on the lookout for the right woman. You\u2019ve never been married or even engaged, you work all the time. You could use a little stability. And the right woman tends to level a man out. Mellow him. Right, Mac?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say, baby,\u201d he said, bringing his cup to his lips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that under advisement,\u201d Eric said, scooping up his home fries. \u201cAnd thanks for keeping these potatoes out of the kiln.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure,\u201d she said. \u201cBusiness good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent. Now that the station offers more services, we have more business. Norm was winding down, getting ready to sell, looking at retirement, so business was moving out of town. We\u2019re spooling up, adding services, bringing business back. It turns out it wasn\u2019t such a big gamble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Gina said. \u201cBut you\u2019re still living in a motel, not dating. We have to take care of that. You need a decent place to live and a woman.\u201d</p><p>Eric drank the last of his coffee, stood, put a twenty on the counter and said, \u201cExtra big tip, Gina, with thanks for the excellent advice.\u201d Although she was laughing as he left the diner, he was thinking, I\u2019m going to have to learn to like fast food. She\u2019s killing me! She\u2019s nosier than a sister!</p><p>But he also thought, I could really use some leveling. Some mellowing.</p><p>Three</p><p>Laine brought her midsize SUV to Eric on Tuesday, the day after they talked. It was a new model and in excellent condition. If he subtracted the cross-country miles from the odometer, she\u2019d only put a few thousand miles on it in a year. Ordinarily he\u2019d have Norm or Manny service the vehicle, but he did it. He found nothing wrong with the car, so he washed and detailed it. Himself.</p><p>Eric had four employees. Norm, who had sold him the station, was trying to avoid going on cruises and Elderhostel trips with his wife, so he kept working. No doubt he told the missus it was absolutely necessary to help out during this ownership transition, but he was more honest with Eric\u2014he wanted to unload the station and put the money in the bank but he wasn\u2019t quite ready to indulge in retirement activities that sounded like sheer torture to him. Nor could he fathom spending day after day with his wife.</p><p>Manny had come with Eric from Eugene after Eric sold his body shop there. Manny was a good friend from way back and had a wife and a passel of kids. Howie had worked part-time for Norm, was about the same age, didn\u2019t do much\u2014if any\u2014mechanical repairs and the two of them gossiped, drank a lot of coffee and pumped a lot of gas. From the look of the place when Eric took over, neither one of them ever pushed a broom or applied a rag to windows or other surfaces. Both of them might quit before too long because if there was one thing Eric hated it was a dirty shop. Classic car collectors especially liked the garage to look like an operating room. He pushed both of those old boys hard.</p><p>And then there was Justin Russell, a lanky, moody seventeen-year-old, who was either troubled or very shy and reminded Eric of himself at that age. Eric suspected he\u2019d hired Justin out of some desire to groom him. It was almost like some sort of psychological experiment, as though by straightening Justin out he could make up for his own delinquent youth. So far that wasn\u2019t happening. But Eric was, if anything, stubborn.</p><p>Justin worked hard, had good hands under the hood and remarkable instincts for a kid who hadn\u2019t tinkered with engines much.</p><p>Eric went into the bathroom, scrubbed his hands, swiped water over his face for good measure, rinsed his mouth and gave the mirror over the sink a shot of glass cleaner. He wiped out the sink with the paper towel he\u2019d used to dry his hands. Then he appraised himself in the mirror. He had taken off his coveralls and was wearing a mechanic\u2019s uniform\u2014dark blue pants, light blue shirt, Lucky\u2019s sewn onto the shirt. His name was embroidered on the pocket. He\u2019d opted for the new business name since he\u2019d been feeling pretty lucky. There was a part of him that wished he were dressed as a civilian, but this was who he was\u2014a mechanic, a body man. His uniform was clean\u2014he always donned a jumpsuit over his clothes when he got into or under a car engine. His hands were clean, even under the nails.</p><p>And then he found Manny and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to deliver a car. I won\u2019t be gone long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, boss.\u201d</p><p>He drove the few short blocks to Laine\u2019s house. He turned off the car. He had her cell phone number and called it from the driveway. \u201cIs this a convenient time to drop off your car?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to drop it off,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll come and get it in an hour or so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, I\u2019m in your driveway,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I can just leave the key fob somewhere, we can settle up when it\u2019s convenient.\u201d She didn\u2019t say anything and he waited. \u201cLaine?\u201d he asked. And then he watched as the front door opened and she walked outside, an astonished look on her face. She was dressed the same way as when he\u2019d seen her other times in the diner\u2014yoga pants, heavy short-sleeved sweatshirt over a long-sleeved T-shirt, tennis shoes, blond hair pulled back into a ponytail. She looked like a young girl. A very pretty young girl.</p><p>Eric got out of the car and handed over the key fob. He pulled out a receipt from the inside pocket of his jacket. \u201cWe serviced the brakes, changed the oil, gave it a lube, rotated the tires and I checked over everything. You\u2019re in very good shape, no surprises. I\u2019d recommend service checks regularly, which depends on how much driving you do. Your car is well cared for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve just called me,\u201d she said. \u201cI would have come for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. I was happy to bring it over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I was going to use plastic to pay for it.\u201d</p><p>He pulled his iPhone out of his pocket. \u201cYou can do that now if you want to or you can come by the shop another time.\u201d He popped an attachment for scanning onto his phone. \u201cWhatever works for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to get to it today,\u201d she said, obviously still surprised.</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t busy. But there\u2019s no rush on\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I can pay you now. Come inside, Eric.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind waiting....\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor Pete\u2019s sake, come inside!\u201d And she turned to precede him into the house.</p><p>Eric stood there for a second. He hadn\u2019t meant to disrupt her day, just wanted to make an effort, show he was both a businessman with great customer service and...well...a gentleman. He followed her a bit slowly. She\u2019d left the door standing open and he entered. It was just a few steps past the foyer staircase into the great room.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d he said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>There was a fire ablaze in the hearth, cozy furniture complete with pictures and hangings on the walls, throws on the chair and sectional sofa, a panoramic view of the bay out of the back windows, flowers on the table and wonderful smells coming from the kitchen. Something was simmering on the stove and Laine used an oven mitt to pull something out of the oven.</p><p>\u201cWow?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s so...domestic,\u201d he said. He ran a hand through his hair, looking around. It was earth tones with splashes of lavender and blue here and there. And there was some red but just some, not much. Welcoming. Warm.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a home,\u201d she said with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cI know, but aren\u2019t you single?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve only seen you out for a run and you said you do computer research. The only girlfriend I\u2019ve had in the past few years was that web designer. I don\u2019t think she knew where the kitchen was. And she was allergic to housework. But she loved her computers.\u201d</p> <p>Laine took off the oven mitts and grabbed her purse. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to live here, it\u2019s going to be comfortable. And I like to cook. Not all the time, but it relaxes me. I\u2019m having company for dinner tonight, but I also do this for myself. What happened to the girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe dumped me for a computer programmer. I bet they live in squalor and are either thin from starvation or getting fat on take-out.\u201d</p><p>He saw a framed picture of Laine with a man\u2014a very good-looking man. They appeared so happy. Then there was a second picture on the sofa table, a picture of two little girls. For a second he felt almost sick. She couldn\u2019t have lost her family! That would be too cruel.</p><p>She found her credit card and presented it. \u201cMy nieces,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem to be too traumatized. About the computer girl.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t explain the man, but that was all right. He swiped the card and presented the screen for her to sign. \u201cWe probably weren\u2019t right for each other anyway. The biggest thing we had in common was that we worked a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what drew you together? Ever ask yourself that?\u201d She scrawled her name across the small screen.</p> <p>\u201cA friend. You know\u2014one of those friends who can\u2019t stand to see a single man on the loose and has to do something to hook \u2019em up. Don\u2019t friends do that to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cApparently none of my friends were ever concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever married?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She just shook her head. \u201cI haven\u2019t dated that much. I travel a lot in my job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you do computer work. How do you travel for that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one likes sending people to training, seminars, leadership workshops or temporary duty to other divisions like the government does. To me, the computer is a tool. I\u2019m no more fascinated by it than that. When I\u2019m not working overtime or on the road, I have other interests. I\u2019ve always liked to cook. It reminds me of my mother, who loved to cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting turned on.\u201d She put her card back in her purse. \u201cYou just met a woman who likes to cook and live in clean environs and you\u2019re actually getting turned on.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I swear...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are! I think you\u2019d marry me right now if I\u2019d promise to love, honor, vacuum and cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously, no...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because you live in a motel. And probably because none of your friends are trying to fix you up,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re looking for a domestic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I am not. I\u2019m a good cook, too. Very good. In fact, I\u2019ll be happy to cook for you....\u201d He stopped and rubbed a hand around the back of his neck, embarrassed. \u201cI\u2019d have to borrow your kitchen, however.\u201d</p><p>She laughed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been renovating and updating the station. From early in the morning to late at night...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome to join us tonight, if you like. It\u2019s just my friend Devon, her fianc\u00e9, her three-year-old and her friend, Rawley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, that\u2019s very nice, but I don\u2019t want to intrude.\u201d He put the phone back in his pocket. \u201cI\u2019ll probably run into you at the diner or something. Let me know if the car is unsatisfactory in any way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I give you a lift back to the station?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, I like the walk. Have a nice evening.\u201d</p><p>He walked outside, into the brisk, moist air. He took a deep breath.</p><p>Not only had finding a woman been the last thing on his mind, but he also thought it made perfect sense to avoid such attachments in a little town like this, a town where he needed to make a living, needed to be respected by his friends and customers. He really couldn\u2019t risk things like romantic drama. Plus, the only female who really had his attention was Ashley, his seventeen-year-old daughter. And he was making a real effort not to dominate her time\u2014she was a high school senior and had better things to do. Besides, he needed little more than work, peace of mind, a little time with Ashley and an opportunity to watch her complete her growth into a fine young woman.</p><p>But then he noticed Laine. And damned if all those resolutions started to grow weak.</p><p>Laine had a very nice dinner with her friends. Spencer brought his son, Austin, a polite and funny ten-year-old. She got the biggest kick out of Rawley, who did very little talking, but was constantly finding things to point out to Mercy. He asked if she wanted her doll to sit at the table with them, prompted her to scrape up red sauce onto her garlic toast, asked if she had drawn any pictures of him lately and wanted to know what movies she\u2019d been watching on her hand-me-down portable DVD player. To the adults, he didn\u2019t have that much to say unless he was asked a direct question.</p><p>Two days later she ran into Eric in the diner. True, she thought she might and timed the end of her run specifically for that purpose. And of course he asked about her little dinner party and if her car was running all right. Two days after that she saw him walking into the deli and she decided it was time to get a pint of Carrie\u2019s fabulous crab salad. He asked how her car was running. Two days after that she saw him in the diner again and he asked her what she\u2019d been cooking lately and...how the car was running.</p><p>She could tell he liked her. When he saw her, he brightened. His face opened up a little and she got a good view of that wide, white smile. He kind of leaned toward her to talk. He was starting to really piss her off! She was going to have to make the first move.</p><p>It had been ten days and five random meetings since he\u2019d delivered her car. Then she ran into him again. She was going home from the diner, he was headed there. There was the usual small talk\u2014weather, car, cooking\u2014and she said, \u201cThis is getting really old, Eric. Why don\u2019t you ask me out? Am I that unappealing?\u201d</p><p>His eyes got round and his mouth fell open. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery eloquent, but for God\u2019s sake, my car is running just fine, I don\u2019t cook big meals every day but when it\u2019s cloudy, dark and wet, I like soups, stews and casseroles, and I can tell you like me. I can\u2019t tell how much you like me, but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get a fix on that in no time. So\u2014we\u2019re both new in town and we only have a few friends. You probably have more than I do, being in business and all, but since we get along, like each other, aren\u2019t dating anyone else, why don\u2019t we go out? We\u2019ll just go eat something. Maybe we can talk about anything other than my car, like our hobbies or something.\u201d</p><p>The look on his face was priceless. He was clearly stunned. \u201cSure,\u201d he finally said.</p><p>\u201cFriday night. And I\u2019m not cooking for you. That hungry, desperate look you get in your eyes when you come face-to-face with my domesticity is alarming. I\u2019m not looking for a man to take care of. Or one to take care of me, for that matter. But I wouldn\u2019t mind getting out of the house for more than a run. And I haven\u2019t been out on a date in so long... Well, you wouldn\u2019t believe how long. I\u2019ve been working. Then I\u2019ve been... I\u2019ll explain another time. So, Friday night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said immediately. \u201cFriday night.\u201d Then he grinned hugely. \u201cYou asked me out on a date. You asked me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got very tired of waiting,\u201d she said with a bit of superior impatience.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been asked out on a date before.\u201d</p><p>She looked him up and down. Six-two, one-eighty and built, copper hair, the most enviable green eyes she\u2019d ever seen, a little shadow of beard. Really gorgeous. Those eyes. God those eyes. \u201cYou big liar,\u201d she said.</p><p>He shook his head and gave a shrug. \u201cNot since the Sadie Hawkins dance in eighth grade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut people fixed you up all the time,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s when you go to the same birthday party or wedding reception. That\u2019s not a date. And if I liked the woman, I asked.\u201d</p><p>She frowned in doubt. \u201cAre you wearing contacts?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head again, but he was still grinning like a fool. \u201cA gift from my mother. So, do you like seafood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m from Boston,\u201d she informed him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find something. I\u2019ll pick you up at six. Is seven too late for dinner? Because I have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t I pick you up? Find the restaurant?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNah, you did the hard part, the asking. I\u2019ll do the rest. And by the way, I\u2019m glad you asked. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you ever going to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so, yes. I was being cautious. Not for my sake. For yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. You\u2019ll tell me more about that at dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough. And you can tell me about the exciting world of research.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI really want you awake on this, our first date.\u201d</p><p>Laine was very good at not overthinking things; she rarely found herself dwelling. On the Friday of her date, she dismissed it from her mind and focused on other things\u2014a computer search for the right new rug for in front of the fireplace in her bedroom. She read a few chapters from a book she\u2019d been into, put in a call to Pax and did a load of laundry. She was highly trained and knew how to place focus exactly where she wanted it. She had proven herself disciplined long ago\u2014it was especially important in deep cover.</p><p>She could manage not to think about the fact that she hadn\u2019t been on a date in a year and a half. How the devil had it been that long?</p><p>She also added a layer of blue polish to her toenails. It was funny the things one missed during a deep-cover assignment. The first two she\u2019d been on had been relatively short\u2014two weeks in a clinic that was suspected of drug trafficking and then four weeks working in a trucker\u2019s dispatch office trying to ferret out the human trafficking connection. But it was over six months in The Fellowship and what she\u2019d really come to grieve was toenail polish, perfume and bath gel. Not to mention hair products. Just because Laine was an FBI agent and an expert markswoman didn\u2019t mean she was a thug or a tomboy. No, sir. She was actually a girlie girl. Yes, she could throw a big guy over the hood of a car and cuff him. And yes, she\u2019d been in some fights\u2014not by choice, but hell, sometimes duty called. She was strong, tough, fearless and feminine.</p><p>Finally it was nearly time and she showered, blew out her hair and donned a pair of nice wool slacks, boots, sweater, jacket and long silk scarf. The boots had thin, high heels\u2014Eric was a solid six-two. She could use a little lift.</p><p>Her first surprise when she answered the door was how well he cleaned up. She nearly laughed at herself. Had she expected him to arrive in his mechanic\u2019s uniform and sensible lace-up boots? He wore dark jeans, a nice sweater, suede jacket and black cowboy boots. And his name wasn\u2019t sewn anywhere on his outfit. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cReady,\u201d she said, turning to lock the door and flinging her white fringed scarf over her shoulder. He stood aside to let her proceed and she suddenly stopped because there in the driveway was the shiniest, cranberry-red, restored car. \u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you can appreciate an old car.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNineteen-seventy Chevy El Camino. Car or truck? That\u2019s the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know your cars,\u201d he said, coming around her to open the passenger door. \u201cYou into cars?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in a big way, but this is beautiful.\u201d But she did know her cars. She could identify just about any vehicle make and model on sight. That was part of police work. She could also remember license plates without the need to write down the numbers\u2014not exactly a common thing among law enforcement officers, but she had a skilled memory. Beyond skilled, really.</p><p>A beautiful restored classic was all about aesthetics and Laine had a sudden and respectful appreciation for what Eric could do. When he joined her in the front seat she was caressing the dash. \u201cDid you do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d he said, turning the key and bringing the engine to life. \u201cA friend saw her at a farm, a nonworking farm, along with four other old, wrecked cars. The property owner was ancient and didn\u2019t give a hoot about those junkers, so I went there and made him a quick deal, handed him some cash and hauled them back to Oregon to work on. This one, I got attached to. I upgraded it, obviously\u2014it\u2019s not all original.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you buy and restore old cars?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes. I have a steady clientele that comes to me for body work and I\u2019m always on the lookout for deals, steals and old abandoned classics, not to mention original parts. Just body work...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t just body work,\u201d she said, running a hand along the smooth dash. \u201cThis is art.\u201d</p><p>That made him smile. \u201cThat\u2019s my business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought your business was mechanics, maintenance. And gas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s part of it. We mean to take care of the town if we can. But body work and restoration is my first love. We\u2019re finishing up a new paint bay in the shop. I left a lot of our specialty tools behind and this is a little like starting from scratch, but building a business makes sense. And it\u2019s already working.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWait a minute\u2014left behind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cOkay, here\u2019s how it went. I bought a failing business a little over ten years ago in Eugene. Over the past decade, with the help of some great mechanics and body men, we made it good and developed a loyal clientele and then some moneybags comes along and wants it bad enough to keep upping his offer until I started looking around for another place to work. Norm\u2019s station had been for sale for years. It\u2019s not much of a garage, really, but it sits on a real nice piece of land with plenty of room to expand. Norm never paid much attention to the space he had\u2014all he wanted to do was pump gas, fix small stuff like brakes. He let a lot of junk collect on his lot rather than putting the space to use. I bought it, cleared it, poured a big slab and we\u2019re expanding, literally one wall at a time. Plumbing and wiring takes more time than anything and in three months, we have a body shop and full-service garage up and running, not to mention new pumps. I\u2019m hoping a couple more former employees from Eugene decide to join me here. We work well together. And I like the ocean.\u201d He glanced at her, eyes twinkling. \u201cNice little town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice little town,\u201d she echoed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the mystery,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMe? Nah. I\u2019m just someone who finagled an off-site telecommuting job because I had shoulder surgery. We can call it rehab plus leave of absence plus vacation, but it really boils down to\u2014I can\u2019t travel or manage temporary duty assignments, so I get to work from home when I can. And home can be anywhere, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet you drove three thousand miles to get \u2018home\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can trust you to keep your mouth shut about that, right?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cWho am I gonna tell?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo, Laine. I mean, who am I gonna tell?\u201d Then he peered at her with those haunting green eyes.</p><p>\u201cThe IRS? Because those sons of bitches are mean as snakes.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cWho\u2019s your boss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPresident Obama. And there could be a supervisor or two between me and Mr. President.\u201d Then she gave him her teasing smile.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cWhy Thunder Point?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cThe short answer is, I have a friend here. Devon is a friend of mine and once she moved here she just couldn\u2019t shut up about this little town. I went online\u2014my specialty, remember\u2014and got a Realtor to send me a bunch of pictures. The longer answer\u2014I put together a plan to take an extended leave from the government job, time to rehab, to think about whether I want to continue to live in the D.C. area, to work that much, that hard. To think about whether my heart\u2019s still in it... It\u2019s complicated. The pressure is terrible sometimes. I\u2019m good at what I do, but seriously, what\u2019s too much? I mean, do you have pressure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said instantly. \u201cBut only the kind I like. And that wasn\u2019t any brilliance on my part. I chose this\u2014I like the kind of pressure I have. I serve some pretty high-dollar masters and their half-million-dollar classics. I can\u2019t make too many mistakes. But then, I don\u2019t make too many mistakes. Not at that, anyway.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t make many mistakes, either, Laine thought. I\u2019m the best at what I do. Yet I can\u2019t keep doing it.</p><p>Four</p><p>Eric had been optimistic regarding his date with Laine, but he had not really expected it to go as well as it did. First off, she asked a million questions about the restoration of the El Camino, right down to the vinyl truck-bed cover and dash instruments, where he found parts and how he pulled it all together. He wasn\u2019t an idiot, he knew she was appealing directly to his male pride. But he could also tell she was genuinely interested, not just trying to pump him up. By the time they got to the restaurant in Bandon, he had already passed the point of no return. He was no longer just attracted to her, he really liked her.</p><p>\u201cI hope this is okay,\u201d he said, pulling into the parking lot of a small restaurant. \u201cIt\u2019s not fancy but Cooper says the food is great and it\u2019s not loud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d she said, unfastening her seat belt and reaching for the door handle.</p><p>He grabbed her wrist. \u201cWait,\u201d he said. \u201cLet me be a gentleman. At least for tonight. I\u2019m trying to make a good impression.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, knock yourself out,\u201d she said, waiting as he came around and opened her door.</p><p>When they were inside, he rejected the first table the waitress showed them. \u201cHow about that one?\u201d he asked, pointing to a table in the corner rather than in the middle of the room. Then he leaned close and said to the waitress, \u201cFirst date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotcha,\u201d she replied, smiling approvingly.</p><p>When they were seated, Laine said, \u201cEither you\u2019re very experienced with first dates or you\u2019re actually suave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old are you?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou look young, very young, but when you open your mouth there\u2019s a whole lot of experience there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirty-three,\u201d she said. \u201cLooking young was a problem when I was fifteen. When I was twenty-one, too. But at thirty-three I don\u2019t mind that much and I think when I\u2019m fifty I\u2019ll be grateful. And you are...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirty-six. For one more month.\u201d</p><p>She ordered a glass of Cabernet, he ordered a beer and they looked at menus. Once they had decided and ordered, he said, \u201cNow it\u2019s your turn, Laine. I want to hear about being a researcher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, no you don\u2019t. But let\u2019s get this out of the way. I work for a government agency on a task force that involves a lot of different government agencies. Like I told you before, I do a lot of background checks, all over the place, none of which I\u2019m allowed to talk about. I have a security clearance. Ninety percent of the time it\u2019s not interesting and when it is interesting I really can\u2019t talk about it. I don\u2019t mean to be dismissive and I\u2019m certainly not being coy, but that\u2019s not what I\u2019d like to talk about, if you can live with that....\u201d</p><p>\u201cSecret clearance, huh?\u201d he said. \u201cI bet you\u2019re connected to spooky stuff.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI used to think so. But seriously, since that\u2019s not what I\u2019m doing right now...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, tell me what you\u2019re interested in besides cooking.\u201d</p><p>It was unmistakable, how her eyes lit up. \u201cLots of things. I love horses, though I haven\u2019t had one since college. I rode as a kid\u2014English saddle and dressage competition. I also took karate and competed. First my mom had me in gymnastics, which I remember as great fun, but then I grew into karate, which I still love. I love parasailing and rock climbing\u2014all things I can\u2019t do right now because of a weak arm, but my shoulder is healed and getting stronger all the time, so one of these days... The family had a sailboat, so I know how to sail. By the time the weather warms up, I\u2019ll be ready to strengthen the shoulder with a kayak paddle on a bay that\u2019s usually still and calm. I really love being outdoors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did all those things as a kid?\u201d</p><p>She gave a nod. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cLaine, I think we had very different childhoods. My dad was a postal carrier and my mom was a housewife. I played Little League and sandlot soccer\u2014teams and uniforms were pretty expensive. I suspect you had lots of advantages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy parents were both surgeons. My mother passed away a few years ago and my dad is approaching seventy but he has an active practice and still operates. Not the way he used to\u2014just sometimes. He\u2019s winding down, his partners doing the bulk of the cases, but he\u2019s still involved. Orthopedics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were a lucky kid,\u201d he said, smiling at her.</p><p>Their salads arrived and they talked while they dug in. She told him she had no idea she was a lucky kid and spent far too much time focusing on things that didn\u2019t satisfy her and he admitted that in his neighborhood, he\u2019d had no idea he was poor, until much later, when he could see the difference between the haves and the have-nots.</p><p>\u201cAnd you come from Thunder Point?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cWe moved there when I was in high school. My folks only lived there a few years, then moved closer to my older sister and her family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re definitely not poor now,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI get by. I have some money saved. Not a fortune. I\u2019m pretty tight, when you get down to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA by-product of growing up not having enough?\u201d</p><p>He chewed a mouthful of salad. \u201cMore likely a by-product of worrying that I don\u2019t deserve what I have. I didn\u2019t even graduate from high school. I got my GED later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least you got it!\u201d</p><p>By the time their entr\u00e9es came, they were talking about the differences in their lives to this point in time\u2014she admitted to a successful college experience, while he claimed a few college courses. He told her it was his brother-in-law who helped him buy the first auto body shop in Eugene, but he managed to pay him back and buy him out. Eric was enjoying the conversation, even though he was the poor cousin to her privileged little girl. That didn\u2019t bother him\u2014his parents were good people, just not rich people. He was well aware that their differences ran far deeper, but he wasn\u2019t going to get into that tonight. He wanted to get to know her first; wanted her to get to know him for the person he was now, not the person he had been in years past. Besides, she was playing some cards very close to her own chest\u2014like the top secret jazz she couldn\u2019t talk about. Surely her good friend Devon had been privy to what Laine actually did for a living. And he was willing to bet it wasn\u2019t \u201cresearch.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>But no matter what was missing, what was there for Eric was plenty. He was further across the line\u2014he really liked her. She was fun and smart and sexy. It sounded like she had a complicated life that she took in stride, which spelled maturity\u2014he appreciated that. There was a certain young wisdom about her when she said things like, \u201cI think it\u2019s too bad when our parents don\u2019t live up to our expectations when it\u2019s even more likely we didn\u2019t live up to theirs.\u201d</p><p>Plus...he liked the way she lifted the fork, licked her lips, brushed back her hair. She had a small dimple on the right side of her mouth, very deep blue eyes, one slightly crooked front tooth that gave her smile an impish quality. She was so articulate; he had had to work hard to become articulate when he began to draw a sophisticated clientele. He hadn\u2019t come from a well-educated background and as a kid he hung with lowlifes. She said she didn\u2019t have a million friends, just a few good ones. \u201cI can relate to that,\u201d he said. \u201cMe, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not very social, when you get down to it,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d much rather have a small dinner with a couple of friends than go to a party. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been to a party in...years. A couple of wedding receptions or retirement parties, but those are almost mandatory events.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like to be more social?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She shook her head. Then she shrugged and said, \u201cI like what I like. I love fixing dinner for friends. I have a twin brother\u2014another doctor, which makes my father very happy. Pax is his name and he\u2019s the most remarkable man I know\u2014Harvard bred, he\u2019s finishing up a fellowship in pediatric surgery at Brigham and Women\u2019s and he actually has a personality. He\u2019s kind and brilliant.\u201d Then she laughed and said, \u201cI guess you can tell, we\u2019re very close. I\u2019m not close to my sister-in-law, but we both love Pax, so we get along well enough.\u201d</p><p>He laughed at that. \u201cI have to admit, my brother-in-law and I are closer than I am to my sister. My sister has been trying to fix me for at least twenty years, my brother-in-law thinks I\u2019m cool.\u201d</p><p>They shared a rich chocolate cheesecake for dessert and Eric asked for a cup of coffee while she finished her second glass of wine. \u201cWhat about that beer?\u201d she asked. \u201cWasn\u2019t it okay? You didn\u2019t even drink half of it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was fine, but I\u2019m not much of a drinker, and I\u2019m driving. I should probably worry more about my coffee consumption.\u201d</p><p>On the way home he asked her, \u201cWhen you were a kid, did you do any middle-class stuff, like...you know...Brownies? T-ball? Explorers Club?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, my parents had us in accelerated academic programs. We had tutors from the beginning. My father pushed really hard. I didn\u2019t even know about those other things. I was playing chess by eight, Pax was an elementary school leader in science club. My dad had a plan and my mom pretty much went along with it. The only reason I was in karate is because Pax was.\u201d She turned toward him and grinned. \u201cBut I took to it better than he did. I can kick the stuffing out of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpoken like a true sister.\u201d</p><p>Eric pulled into her driveway. He turned to look at her and damn, she was so pretty. This was just about a peak experience for him. \u201cGood first date,\u201d he said, oh so eloquently.</p><p>\u201cExcellent first date.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d he told her. \u201cLet me be a gentleman.\u201d</p><p>He led her toward the door and when they got there she stopped and turned, looking up at him expectantly. \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t an idiot. He knew what she was waiting for. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to get to know me better before we have that good-night kiss?\u201d he asked, giving her a chance to make a break for it.</p><p>\u201cLook, I haven\u2019t been out on a real date in over a year and before that it was a series of really bad dates with guys I\u2019d never date a second time and this was an excellent date. Didn\u2019t I just say that? And damn it, I want to cap it off with a\u2014\u201d</p><p>It rapidly crossed his mind that she must have been a supervisor, at least. He slid his arm around her waist and lifted her up to his lips. She was small but not that light; he could feel the muscles that hadn\u2019t been so obvious. This was a strong woman. He found her mouth with his and planted one on her and then, almost instantly, he fell in love with that mouth. With one hand supporting her at the small of her back and the other plunged into her soft hair at the back of her head, he urged her lips open. He was cautious with his invasive tongue but she wasn\u2019t. She welcomed him, pulled him in, joined him in tongue-play. Her arms circled his neck and held on tight and he moved over her mouth hungrily, drinking in her taste. She was just perfect. It was almost scary how perfect she was. He lapped at her mouth, devoured her, started breathing hard in spite of his intention to be cool. He was not cool. He was over the edge.</p><p>He slowly broke away, but didn\u2019t put her on her feet. He loved having her up against him. \u201cTell the truth. The president works for you....\u201d</p><p>That made her laugh. \u201cWant to come in?\u201d she asked in a breathy whisper.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIf I come in, I won\u2019t leave till morning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s negotiable....\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get to know each other a little better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. I didn\u2019t think men said no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like you,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot. I don\u2019t want you to have any regrets. I want you to be sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you? You want to be sure?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Oh, man, he was too sure. But there was a lot about him she didn\u2019t know. And the front stoop was not the place to go through the details. \u201cAt least one more date, honey,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we\u2019re both ready, but let\u2019s take it a little slower....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m a slut?\u201d</p><p>He laughed at her. \u201cI think you\u2019re a goddess!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect answer,\u201d she said, wiggling in his arms until he set her on her feet. \u201cGood date, good first kiss, let\u2019s see if you can live up to the rest of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, the pressure,\u201d he said, chuckling. He leaned down and kissed her nose. \u201cThank you, Laine. I had a good time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think you\u2019ll ask me out again or are you just going to ask how my car is running for the next week?\u201d</p><p>He loved her sass. Loved it. She was so bold; not a coy bone in her body. \u201cSunday night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething going on tomorrow night?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m pretty busy tomorrow during the day, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I cook us dinner?\u201d she asked.</p><p>And he knew. He knew. He was going to have to lay it all on her\u2014everything he held in his past. It might just freak her out. And if it didn\u2019t freak her out, he\u2019d be staying till Sunday morning. This was a beautiful, terrifying impasse.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be here.\u201d</p><p>After her date, Laine washed her face, brushed her teeth, put on her favorite pajamas, lit the fire in her bedroom and snuggled into bed. Ordinarily she would close her eyes, take a few deep, slow breaths and worry that sleep might elude her or that she\u2019d wake with a start because some deep, subconscious fear chased her in the dark of night.</p><p>Before the shooting she had been so highly disciplined she could grab sleep whenever it was available. After the shooting, she had suffered bouts of sleeplessness. Sometimes she thought she heard a gunshot and jolted awake, panting. When the FBI shrink had asked how she\u2019d been sleeping she said, \u201cGroggily, because of pain meds, I suppose. But I sleep. I\u2019ve always been good at sleeping.\u201d She could tell the shrink wasn\u2019t fooled. Agents probably told her that all the time.</p><p>But tonight she welcomed a little sleeplessness.</p><p>She watched the fire and thought about that man, that handsome, delightful man. And thought about sex. Everything Eric had said and done on their first date indicated a man who was confident and thoughtful enough to be good in bed. She couldn\u2019t remember when she\u2019d had sex last.</p><p>Oh, yes, she could\u2014she\u2019d just rather not. It was an agent she\u2019d worked a case with in New York; when the case was wrapped, they\u2019d gone out for drinks, back to his hotel and splat. Very disappointing sex. What was his name? Oh, right, Paul Remmings\u2014DEA. Very nice guy, very sharp and quick, with quick being the operative word. Hmm.</p><p>She knew one of the problems in law enforcement was being drawn to like creatures, probably because that\u2019s where she spent most of her time. And when it came to civilians, she couldn\u2019t let herself be transparent with them, which didn\u2019t lend itself to intimacy. If she were completely honest with herself, that was one of the reasons for this hiatus\u2014she needed to expand her boundaries, check out the real world, far away from the FBI.</p><p>And bingo, what had the real world offered up? Oh, my, oh, my, oh, Eric. Both tempting and, based on what he said, tempted.</p><p>Then she thought about cooking. It would have to showcase the best part of herself. Seafood chowder or bouillabaisse. Maybe crab legs. Or fresh catch...but she was partial to soups and stews, especially on cold nights. She considered a lot of options from chili to chicken soup.</p><p>When she did finally fall asleep, she woke to a dark dawn, drizzle and frigid temperatures and it made her smile. This was custom-made for her second date\u2014there would be a fire and a hot, comforting meal. She made a list that included gourmet coffee for him and a nice bottle of Sauvignon Blanc for her. She would make her own cheesecake\u2014something cool on the palate after a heavy meal.</p><p>She got her shopping out of the way first, settling on one of her passions\u2014chicken and dumplings. No one had made dumplings like her mother and Laine had all her mother\u2019s skills...and recipes. She\u2019d start with crab-stuffed tomato halves and crispy Parmesan bread sticks. She got a start on her chopping and mixing and then, despite the cold drizzle, she went for a run to burn off a little of that hyper, anticipatory energy.</p><p>On her way back to her house, she paced in front of the diner for a while until she was breathing more evenly. Then she went inside and jumped up on a counter stool in front of Gina.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Gina said. \u201cGreat day for a run?\u201d she asked, grinning.</p><p>\u201cIt is, actually. Can you bring me something hot and wonderful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a secret stash of instant hot chocolate,\u201d she said, pulling an envelope out of her apron pocket. \u201cI can shoot a little whipped cream on top.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, I want that,\u201d Laine said. Then she looked around. \u201cNo crowd today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaturday lunch in the rain doesn\u2019t usually draw a crowd, which is fine by me.\u201d Gina poured hot water into a cup, added the mix, stirred and put it in front of Laine before bringing out the can of whipped cream. \u201cYou must be a dedicated runner to be out in this slop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like the slop,\u201d she said. She took a sip and said, \u201cAhhhh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes one of you,\u201d Gina said. \u201cI get tired of the rain and fog and live for the sunny days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a date last night,\u201d Laine said softly. She smiled and knew her eyes glittered. \u201cA good date. A nice date. And I\u2019m having an encore tonight. I had to burn off some energy. I really don\u2019t want to peak too soon. That\u2019s always a prelude to disappointment....\u201d</p><p>Gina looked stunned. \u201cWith...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEric. The gas man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! Wow!\u201d</p><p>Laine looked outside and saw him walk out of the deli and hold the door for someone. \u201cAnd speak of the devil,\u201d she said. And then she watched in wonder as a pretty young woman came out. Eric let the door close, spoke to the young woman briefly, then they hugged. She thought her throat might close. \u201cOh,\u201d she said quietly. Eric walked away. The woman crossed the street to the diner and Laine saw that she was just a girl, really. \u201cGod, she\u2019s so young. What\u2019s going...? He is much too old for her!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>Gina laughed softly. \u201cThey\u2019re not dating, Laine. He\u2019s her father.\u201d</p><p>Laine\u2019s head snapped back into forward position and looked at Gina in shock. \u201cBut...\u201d</p> <p>The girl came in and walked right behind the counter. \u201cHi, Mom. Eric gave me an Amazon gift card.\u201d Then she looked at Laine. \u201cHi,\u201d she said, and Laine could see the resemblance\u2014red hair, green eyes, but that smile belonged to someone else. Gina.</p><p>\u201cAshley, this is Laine. Laine, meet my daughter, Ashley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d Ashley said. \u201cI\u2019ll go change and be right out to relieve you.\u201d</p><p>Laine was speechless. She didn\u2019t even know what question to form first and she felt the color drain from her face. Great game face, Laine, she chided herself.</p><p>\u201cHigh-school romance,\u201d Gina said. \u201cEric didn\u2019t know about Ashley until about a year ago. I was very young and raised Ashley alone, with my mother\u2019s help. The deli is my mother\u2019s business\u2014Ashley works there part-time, whenever Mom needs her help. And she\u2019s here a few afternoons and evenings a week.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t mention...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you can\u2019t know everything about each other after one date,\u201d Gina said with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cHaving a daughter would seem real high on the list,\u201d Laine said. And then she felt the color come back to her face with a vengeance and she thought, What the hell? I\u2019m an experienced undercover investigator! I don\u2019t go pale, don\u2019t flush, don\u2019t allow personal emotions to dominate my behavior or responses. But she said, \u201cYou and Eric?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting along better than I expected we would. I located him and met with him to get some medical history from his side of the family, a purely practical thing. It was Ashley\u2019s decision to meet him and at first it made me very nervous, very paranoid, but it\u2019s worked out well for both of them, I think. He\u2019s changed a lot in seventeen years. But then, so have I.\u201d</p><p>But for Laine, there was a red flag. Having children, having a child, being a parent\u2014even a recent or part-time parent\u2014would seem to be one of the most obvious things to mention, maybe right after what you did for a living. How had they spent almost four hours together without that subject coming up? Concealment? Because hiding information was one of the first signs something was wrong.</p><p>Is that so, Agent Carrington? she chided herself. But wait, wasn\u2019t her situation a matter of public safety? National security? Almost?</p> <p>But she said to Gina, \u201cIt seems to have worked out, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let this get under your skin, Laine. I\u2019m a very happy woman. Mac seems to respect Eric. And Mac isn\u2019t easy. I\u2019m sure when you bring this up to Eric, he\u2019ll give you the whole story. He\u2019s a very nice guy. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, that\u2019s a tough one. He was nice to me, but he was such a typical nineteen-year-old\u2014shiftless, irresponsible, egocentric. And I was a completely typical teenage girl\u2014love was more important than common sense. It\u2019s a terrible trap\u2014but I do believe we\u2019ve outgrown those tendencies. Look, we all have baggage. Don\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said. However, Laine believed she could keep the heaviest of her baggage to herself for a long time. And it wasn\u2019t all about her work with the FBI. \u201cBut you know what? The best way to take care of this is to take care of this.\u201d She stood up. \u201cWhat do I owe you for the cocoa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the house. Don\u2019t draw blood. I forgave him a long time ago and I think he\u2019s forgiven me for keeping Ashley to myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t hurt him,\u201d she said with a weak smile. Then she got out of the diner before she thought about it any further.</p><p>She jogged down the block, hood up and covering her head, and went straight for the station. There were a couple of cars at the pumps being taken care of by a teenager. Inside the garage, she could see someone under the hood of a car. He had long legs she recognized, although now he was wearing a coverall of some kind.</p> <p>\u201cEric?\u201d</p><p>He peeked out. First he smiled, then he frowned in concern. \u201cLaine, you\u2019re all wet....\u201d</p><p>She stepped toward him. \u201cI just met Ashley in the diner. You didn\u2019t mention her.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed a rag and wiped his hands. \u201cI meant to, but we were talking about other things.\u201d He grinned at her. \u201cObviously I can\u2019t keep her a secret. The hair, the eyes\u2014she\u2019s either a clone or mine. Isn\u2019t she beautiful?\u201d</p><p>Laine nodded but felt numb.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s beautiful inside, too. Just an awesome kid. Gina and her mother really worked their magic raising her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt makes me wonder, though, what other important things you might be waiting to tell me. Because I like the really major stuff up front. I don\u2019t want to get involved and then find out there are issues like having a family that wasn\u2019t even mentioned.\u201d</p><p>Eric frowned as if in thought. He was quiet for a moment. Then he took a deep breath and spoke. \u201cThere\u2019s no privacy for talking here, Laine. Go home, get dried off. I\u2019ll wash my hands and come over. I\u2019ll tell you the circumstances, you\u2019ll ask me anything on your mind. We\u2019ll get it all on the table. Before tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore tonight?\u201d she asked, already disappointed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to waste your time. I like you. I want you to like me. But I\u2019m not perfect by a stretch. So let\u2019s do it.\u201d He lifted one of those copper brows. \u201cHow\u2019s that sound?\u201d</p><p>It sounded like bad news was coming. But it had to be done.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me wait too long,\u201d she said. Then she turned and jogged out of the garage and down the hill to her house.</p><p>Laine threw on a warm, dry sweat suit and put her chicken on to stew with a halved onion and the end of the celery stalks in the water. It was one o\u2019clock. She put the ingredients for the Parmesan breadsticks on the counter\u2014that would be her next project. She was determined to make her chicken and dumplings whether her encore date happened or not.</p><p>And then there was a knock at the door.</p><p>She opened it and there he stood in that blue jacket and pants. She took a breath. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be like this\u2014so suspicious of everything. Certainly a beautiful, sweet girl like Ashley is nothing to be\u2014\u201d</p><p>He came inside, took her elbow in a firm grip and said, \u201cCome on, Laine. Let\u2019s talk.\u201d He directed her to the sofa. They sat there, facing each other. \u201cAshley\u2019s one of the best things that ever happened to me. She\u2019s letting me help her look at colleges. I shouldn\u2019t even have that privilege\u2014not only am I not educated, but Gina and Mac have been her parents, not me. I didn\u2019t know about Ashley. Well, I wondered...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI dropped out of high school at sixteen. I thought I had the world by the balls because I was making nine dollars an hour changing oil and tuning up engines. And girls\u2014I had girls. And boy,\u201d he said with a rueful laugh, \u201cI thought I had all the moves, too. I thought I was so slick\u2014God\u2019s gift. And I was just a stupid horny kid. And Gina\u2014she was the prettiest girl. All of fifteen, but I had no brain and it didn\u2019t even register that she was too young. We dated, if you can call it that\u2014it was a few fast-food meals and movies and a lot of making out. And then she said she thought she might be pregnant and I ran like my pants were on fire. I was nineteen and she was fifteen\u2014I almost heard the cell door slam behind me. I headed out of town and didn\u2019t look back. I found work in Idaho\u2014more mechanics. And I found my kind of buds\u2014the kind that worked by day and drank and partied and did some recreational drugs at night. We spent our money partying and I thought I had life figured out until I saw the flashing lights in the rearview mirror. My new buddies stopped for a case of beer and I was driving while they bought the beer because I was nineteen and they were twenty-one.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. She had not expected this, but she was a trained interrogator and nothing much surprised her.</p><p>\u201cYep. They held up the store. Took the case of beer and eighty dollars\u2014they were such high rollers. There was a silent alarm and my buddies...? They didn\u2019t even really have a gun, thank God, or we might\u2019ve all been killed. One of them stuck his finger out in a sweatshirt pocket and said, \u2018Hand over the cash!\u2019 We were tried separately but I had the worst public defender, toughest judge and the longest sentence. I did five years.\u201d</p><p>She was quiet for a long moment. \u201cCrap,\u201d she said before she could stop herself. She fell against the couch back and closed her eyes. She put her hand against her forehead.</p><p>\u201cFive,\u201d he repeated. \u201cI don\u2019t drink much because for five years I didn\u2019t drink at all and while I was on parole, no drugs and no alcohol was the price of freedom. Believe me, a case of beer is never going to be that important again. I have no intention of going back to the useless imbecile I was. I cleaned up my act, learned some lessons, moved on to a better life. That\u2019s it, Laine. I\u2019m an ex-con. Gina, Mac, Ashley and for all I know the whole town is aware of it. I\u2019m not trying to hide anything but I don\u2019t advertise it. I was going to tell you tonight\u2014I\u2019m not trying to pull anything.\u201d</p><p>She opened her eyes and looked at him. \u201cDo we have anything in common?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m also afraid of heights,\u201d he said. \u201cI won\u2019t be parasailing or rock climbing with you. I can\u2019t even watch movies that have people fighting on the rooftops and ledges of buildings. And I\u2019m in passable good shape but I never took karate. I never took lessons of any kind. You can probably kick my ass, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know the half of it,\u201d she muttered. \u201cWhat a mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this is all I have. I\u2019m a mechanic who was a delinquent and had a baby I didn\u2019t even know about. I thought about Gina and wondered, but I didn\u2019t think she\u2019d appreciate a letter from prison asking about her condition, so I kept my curiosity to myself. That\u2019s it\u2014that\u2019s all I\u2019ve got.\u201d He stood up.</p><p>\u201cEric, I\u2019m an FBI agent.\u201d</p><p>He sat back down. \u201cJesus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Not on the job at the moment but that doesn\u2019t change my status. I guess you\u2019ve figured out\u2014I\u2019m not talking about that around town. I don\u2019t need people looking at me funny. I\u2019m a Fed. A fibbie. I hurt my shoulder by getting in the way of a bullet. I can kick your ass. We don\u2019t fool around about that stuff....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t weigh one-twenty soaking wet!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I know every dirty trick,\u201d she told him. \u201cI can kill you with my bare hands.\u201d</p><p>He shuddered.</p><p>\u201cOkay, not with my bare hands, but if I had a corkscrew or hat pin, you could be history. My brother thinks I\u2019m cool. My father thinks I\u2019m \u2018blue-collar.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Eric laughed in spite of himself. \u201cHe\u2019s jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not. I\u2019ve never quite measured up to his expectations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, after getting arrested, going to prison and being forever an ex-con, my parents have been pretty disappointed in me, as you can imagine. We get along better these days, but they\u2019re older than dirt and lack the energy to stay mad at me. And then there\u2019s Ashley. My mother and sister had no idea I could actually produce something that pure, that brilliant, that beautiful.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cBut then, neither did I. I give all the credit to Gina. If I\u2019d had half a brain back then, I\u2019d have let her straighten me out....\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you still love her?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He ran a hand through his thick, dark hair. \u201cI never loved her, Laine. I was attracted to her and knew she was an awesome person, but back then I lacked the capacity for real love. She was so lucky I ran.

It\u2019s all public record. I have no control over that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re trying to start a business in Thunder Point,\u201d she reminded him.</p> <p>He shrugged. \u201cIf I\u2019m lucky, my new customers won\u2019t know I\u2019m an ex-con until they\u2019ve gotten to know me for the guy I am now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m stewing the chicken,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for the inconvenience. I should\u2019ve told you last night. But damn, I just couldn\u2019t. I was having such a good time. I wanted you to like me, I did.\u201d</p><p>She stood up. She put her hands on her hips. \u201cGo home and shower after work and come back. I\u2019m making my mother\u2019s dumplings. They melt in your mouth. I bought special coffee for you and special wine for me....\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaine, maybe we\u2019re better off just letting it go right\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not supposed to get involved with persons of ill repute, so you better have turned a corner. Because damn it, I\u2019m stewing the chicken. And it\u2019s a wet, cold night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d she countered.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cAs long as you promise all hat pins and corkscrews are out of reach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll drop the dumplings after you get here. They\u2019re fragile. We don\u2019t screw with dumplings. Don\u2019t be late.\u201d</p><p>Five</p> <p>Eric felt the impulse to run away, something he hadn\u2019t felt in many years. He wasn\u2019t even sure how many years. This time it was for an entirely different reason\u2014for once he wasn\u2019t afraid of being trapped, he was afraid Laine wouldn\u2019t give him a chance. He was afraid she\u2019d come to her senses. That fear was torturously coupled with his overwhelming desire for her, and his willingness to take any risk to make it happen. It was undeniable. He wanted her. It was so new and hot, he didn\u2019t even recognize the emotions.</p><p>His last girlfriend, Cara, had not inspired these feelings in him, not at all. He\u2019d been fond of her. More than fond, really\u2014she was adorable. Cute and funny. When they were together, which hadn\u2019t been too often even when they lived together, they enjoyed each other. They had good sex and he\u2019d been tremendously grateful for that. And when she\u2019d told him they were over, he had barely grieved. It felt a lot like saying goodbye to a friend at the train station. Like, \u201cGood luck, be safe, stay in touch if you can, take care of yourself, I\u2019ll be thinking of you.\u201d Even then he knew that the thought of her wouldn\u2019t keep him awake at night. She was a sweet girl. He\u2019d been lucky to have two nice years with her. He was all too aware Cara had never created a fierce hunger in him. They were like roommates with privileges, excellent privileges. Eric had thought that\u2019s what it was supposed to be like.</p><p>But now, he ached for Laine.</p><p>All through the afternoon he did what he did best\u2014buried himself in an engine and just let his mind argue with itself. He could do the noble thing and let this relationship end before it began because it was destined to be a disaster. Well, that was if Laine wanted him as much as he wanted her. She was the law, he was the reformed criminal. She came from an educated, mucky-muck Boston family. He came from a lower-middle-class background in which only his brother-in-law had attended college. She wanted to soar from great heights, he liked his feet firmly planted on the ground. And yet he was drawn to her like a moth to a flame.</p><p>Eric\u2019s instincts told him it was a dangerous prospect to want someone with the kind of hunger he felt for Laine. It couldn\u2019t work. He tried like bloody hell to turn back, to call her and say, \u201cLook, let\u2019s not be stupid here, we are not going to last through the weekend and we both know it. Let\u2019s cut our losses.\u201d</p><p>Instead, he asked Manny to keep the station open for Saturday evening, asked Norm to open Sunday morning, asked Justin to work with Norm.</p><p>\u201cMy mom usually needs me Sunday mornings. I have to take her to church,\u201d Justin said.</p><p>Eric grinned. \u201cYou? Church?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy mother, church. Didn\u2019t you hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez, I just got very excited,\u201d Eric said. \u201cAny chance you pick up pointers while you\u2019re taking your mother to church?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I don\u2019t pick my nose in public anymore.\u201d</p><p>Eric frowned. \u201cProgress,\u201d he said. \u201cNorm can probably handle things in the morning. I won\u2019t be too late.\u201d</p><p>Well, look at me, he thought to himself. Trying to talk myself into running for my life before two perfectly innocent people get hurt, but instead I get people to cover for me in the morning like I\u2019m already invited to spend the night. If she\u2019s half as smart as I think she is, she\u2019ll nip this idea in the bud.</p><p>He went to his motel to shower, shave and change clothes. At exactly six, he knocked on Laine\u2019s door. She opened the door and just looked at him for a long moment. She looked at him like she hadn\u2019t been expecting him. Then she pulled him inside, kicked the door closed and jumped into his arms. He lifted her off the floor and went after her mouth. Everything he thought about all day long was gone. He leaned back against the closed door and held her against him; he loved that strong, muscled, supple little body in his arms. Had they said hello? They hadn\u2019t even said hello....</p><p>He held her tight, his hand running over her butt, his lips urging hers open, his tongue penetrating... He was getting ideas, which preceded getting hard by about three seconds. Her breathing was already rapid and somewhat labored and he was dizzy. He leaned his head back, breaking the lip-lock for a second. \u201cWhoa,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cDouble whoa,\u201d she said. \u201cYou smell good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou smell even better,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI lit the fire upstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love a woman with a plan,\u201d he said, kissing her again. Long and wet and deep and luxurious. She was delicious. She was willing. She was his.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have a plan,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know I was going to do that. I\u2019m not sorry. Let\u2019s just go upstairs. Huh, Eric?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about those fragile dumplings...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew the dumplings\u2014they\u2019ll be fine. After we\u2019re fine...\u201d</p><p>He slid an arm under her knees and carried her up the stairs. \u201cWe\u2019re crazy, you know,\u201d he pointed out to her. \u201cNo way this works....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is going to work just fine,\u201d she said, unbuttoning the top button of his shirt. Then the second. Then she had to stop because he was wearing a heavy sweater over his shirt.</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve known you were a woman who had no trouble asking for what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you have other ideas, you better speak up,\u201d she said.</p><p>He stopped in the middle of the staircase. Holding her with one arm, one foot on the next rising step, he rested her bottom on his raised thigh. \u201cAll I can say is thank you.\u201d Then he took her lips again. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about your mouth all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust my mouth?\u201d she said, smiling against his lips.</p><p>\u201cIf I let myself think about anything else, I might\u2019ve had an injury. How fast can you get naked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFaster than you, I bet.\u201d</p><p>He raced up those stairs like lightning.</p><p>He put her on her bed and she was up on her knees, shoving his jacket off his shoulders, lifting his sweater by the hem, over his head. He took care of the shirt he wore, disregarding buttons and pulling it over his head. Then he pulled off her sweater and she flopped back on the bed, kicking off her pants.</p><p>There he stood in his jeans and boots, looking down at her. \u201cHo, boy,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re gorgeous. And you\u2019re very fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Eric. I showed you mine. Show me yours.\u201d</p><p>He sat on the bed and worked off his boots first. \u201cPatience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have that,\u201d she informed him.</p><p>He pulled a couple of foil packages out of his pocket, tossed them on the bedside table, then slid down the jeans. He put a knee on the bed and let her have a look.</p><p>\u201cHoly guacamole,\u201d she said. Then she opened her arms and he filled them.</p><p>He rolled with her so they were on their sides, locked together with their lips while he slowly caressed her breasts and back and belly. When his fingers moved lower, she grabbed his wrist. \u201cEric, suit up. The second you touch me, I\u2019m gone. I\u2019ll be way ahead of you.\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her and gave her lower lip a gentle nip. \u201cThe first time, anyway. I can catch up, no worries.\u201d</p><p>Eric wasn\u2019t always great at following orders; he didn\u2019t get the condom right away, as she instructed. He\u2019d spent all day trying not to think about this and the last few minutes praying he wouldn\u2019t be too fast. That became a nonissue right away. He slid a slow, easy finger into her, his thumb brushing against her clitoris, and she went off like a firecracker, clenching and throbbing and drenching him in liquid heat. \u201cGod,\u201d he said. \u201cBeautiful. Beautiful.\u201d And then he kept her going for a long, long time until she collapsed beside him, flat on her back, spent. He kissed her cheek. \u201cCan you do that again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she whispered weakly.</p><p>\u201cIf you give me two things, I can die a happy man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cName \u2019em,\u201d she said, her eyes still closed.</p><p>\u201cLet me have a little taste, then do that when I\u2019m inside. Let me watch your eyes while I\u2019m there. Blow my mind. Kill me. I\u2019m on a hair trigger.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes opened a slit, but they sparkled. Her lips curved in a smile. She opened her legs for him.</p><p>He slid down her body, stopping to make sure her peaked nipples got the attention they deserved, then he went farther. He kissed the inside of her thighs, but quickly. He was anxious. He was ravenous. He was ready to explode. He gave her a few licks with a gentle tongue, then a little rougher, thoroughly enjoying her moaning and wiggling against him.</p><p>He went back to her mouth. \u201cMore later,\u201d he promised. \u201cLaine, you\u2019re the sweetest thing I\u2019ve ever had on my tongue and I want you so bad, I think I might pass out. Tell me what you want. You can have anything you want. You own me right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust get inside me, Eric. Before I climb on you and just take the choice away from you.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t make her wait\u2014he slid in slowly, luxuriated for a moment, then began to move. He grabbed her hands in one of his, stretched them over her head and moved faster, then harder, then deeper and harder. She bit his shoulder, groaned, and let him have it, throwing another climax at him. So fierce, so tight, so powerful, he let it all go with a loud moan. She was unstoppable; she was hot as lava. He came until his brain was empty and she was a limp pile of moist flesh beneath him.</p><p>\u201cMy God,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he concurred in a weak breath.</p><p>He held his weight off her until he could catch his breath, then with his arms gently cradling her, he rolled them onto their sides again. He kept his mouth on hers, just pressing his lips and tongue against her lips and tongue, holding her against him for as long as he could\u2014he didn\u2019t want to leave her body. He thought it was very probably the best sexual experience of his life. He certainly couldn\u2019t remember anything to compare it to. He wanted to say something emotional, intimate. Something memorable. But all he could come up with was \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cAll my bones melted.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cA-plus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get full of yourself. And don\u2019t stop trying. God, Eric. Have you always been a sex god?\u201d</p><p>He raised up on one elbow and looked down at her. He shook his head. \u201cI think I can honestly say, you bring out the best in me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cWhew. In a few minutes, I\u2019ll think about those dumplings....\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew the dumplings. I can just live on you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get very thin,\u201d she said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. I think we need to do that again. Right away. Before we forget how that works. Damn, baby, we were very good. I think we found what we have in common.\u201d</p><p>They made love again, then showered together and that was just another opportunity to enjoy each other\u2019s bodies. Then they were going to dress to go downstairs to eat but were sidetracked by the bed. By the time they got to the kitchen they were weak with hunger and drunk on sex. Eric had never made love so much in one evening in his life.</p><p>They didn\u2019t get to the dumplings until 11:00 p.m. Laine told him she thought they were probably her best ever, but the taste and texture barely registered with Eric. The only thing he could taste was Laine and he didn\u2019t want to forget it for a second.</p><p>They sat on the floor in the great room, in front of the fire, trays on their laps, knees almost touching. While they ate, they talked. \u201cThis is a completely inappropriate question,\u201d Laine said, \u201cbut will you tell me about all your lovers?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cThere haven\u2019t been very many. I told you, my last girlfriend was a cute little computer nerd and we lived together for almost two years. She was special in a hundred ways, but we both knew we were temporary from the start and she dumped me last summer for someone more her type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know when you\u2019re temporary?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou tell me, Laine. You\u2019re not married or engaged or serious\u2014and I can\u2019t believe every man in America doesn\u2019t want you for his very own. And you\u2019re here while on leave\u2014you\u2019ll go back to the Bureau. You won\u2019t work out of Thunder Point, I know that. I just refuse to think about it right now. Want to tell me about your men?\u201d</p><p>She just shook her head. \u201cMy professional life didn\u2019t leave a lot of room for that. I was in a few relationships, short-term, with guys whose lives were just like mine, which meant high pressure, bad hours, temporary assignments, traveling a lot. But your life is different\u2014one business, one address, not so much uncertainty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found my love mostly in cars,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cI\u2019m not a ladies\u2019 man. I like women, but I was busy. Busy trying to rebuild myself. Ten years is a long time to be out of circulation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said five years....\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFive in jail, five on parole. Ten years under a microscope. I didn\u2019t test the rules, not even a little bit. And I was nervous about forming attachments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut when you were young, before jail...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was a fuck-around idiot. There\u2019s nothing more to tell about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a daughter.\u201d</p><p>His eyes actually got a little dreamy. She couldn\u2019t help but smile as he talked. \u201cI got so lucky there. And after hearing those scary words one time\u2014\u2018I think I might be pregnant\u2019\u2014I was very careful. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s the only one, and what a miracle. Wait till you get to know her better. I can\u2019t believe I was a part of creating her. You won\u2019t believe how great she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Gina\u2019s pretty great, so...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must have a guardian angel after all,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat are we going to do after we finish dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want to go back to bed. I want to sleep with you tonight, but that\u2019s your call. I can put on my boots and jacket and head home. I\u2019m just saying, I\u2019m yours tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you wash, I\u2019ll dry, then we\u2019ll snuggle in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like that idea.\u201d</p><p>When they were back in bed, they whispered to each other, telling little bits of their lives. It was true, they seemed to have little in common, and yet Laine hadn\u2019t felt this compatible with another human being in her adult life.</p><p>At three in the morning, Laine woke and reached for him and his side of the bed was empty. \u201cEric?\u201d</p><p>He sat down on the edge of the bed. \u201cShhh. Go back to sleep. I didn\u2019t want to wake you\u2014I was going to leave a note. My phone went. I have to go tow someone....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hear the phone,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt was on vibrate and I heard it bouncing around the nightstand. The number on the side of the truck, the number the cops have, it\u2019s my cell number. I got a text, wanna see?\u201d</p><p>She liked that he wasn\u2019t private about it, hiding his text messages. She shook her head. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig mess on Freemont Bridge near Bandon. The cops threw out stop sticks to disable a car they were chasing and ended up blowing out tires on three civilian cars that weren\u2019t being pursued. My job is going to be easier than theirs. They\u2019re going to have some very annoying paperwork. I texted that I was on my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid their man get away?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea. I can come back. It\u2019s up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long will you be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat depends on how many tow trucks respond. It could be a few hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should call me. It\u2019s the only way I\u2019ll know you can\u2019t stop thinking of me.\u201d Then she smiled just as she closed her eyes sleepily.</p><p>He kissed her forehead. \u201cI have a feeling you\u2019re going to be under my skin for a very long time,\u201d he said.</p><p>Eric jogged to his station, where he covered his decent clothes with a work coverall and changed out his boots into lace-up, steel-toed work boots. Because he wasn\u2019t sure of the terrain around the bridge, he opted for his flatbed side puller with the nine-thousand-pound hydraulic winch. If he found a car off the road or down an incline, he could get it on the truck. If all he needed to do was tow, he could manage that easily.</p><p>Lots of flashing lights along the bridge greeted him. He shone his overhead beams on the scene and got out to investigate. There were two state police cruisers along with a couple of local cop cars from a town south of the bridge. And because this was pretty close to his territory, Mac McCain was there. Eric saw two cars with flats along the side of the bridge and then, predictably, down the hill on the near side of the bridge, a large SUV flipped on its side. The driver must have lost control when the tires were spiked by the stop sticks.</p><p>He approached Mac first. \u201cInjuries?\u201d</p><p>Mac shook his head. \u201cGuy and his wife in the SUV are a little shook up and she has a couple of bruises, but they exited the vehicle without incident. They\u2019re over there, moaning and groaning about the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the bad guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho knows?\u201d Mac said. \u201cThe Keystone Kops over there thought they had him. I think he pulled off the road into some trees or something and when they came peeling down to the bridge, he turned around and headed in the other direction. Stolen car. We\u2019ll probably find it abandoned before very long.\u201d He grinned. \u201cAll these state troopers and sheriff\u2019s department crew look like they\u2019re feeling pretty smug, don\u2019t they? That\u2019s relief you see\u2014so glad they didn\u2019t fuck this up. Can you get that SUV? We have another wrecker coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got it. Where do you want that SUV to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s between you and the owner. We\u2019re not impounding anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s see what they want.\u201d</p><p>Eric made his way over to a couple standing by the side of the road. He touched the brim of his hat. \u201cFolks? Rough night, I see. I\u2019m here to get your car up that hill. I haven\u2019t looked at it yet, but it\u2019s probably going to need four new tires and since it took a slide, I\u2019d recommend an axel and frame check. It needs to get up on the lift and the undercarriage should be checked to make sure it\u2019s safe. And someone should look at the body for damage. I can handle all of that in Thunder Point. Where are you folks headed?\u201d</p><p>The man sucked noisily on a mint. \u201cHome from a visit in Sacramento. We\u2019re almost home. Eugene.\u201d</p><p>Eric nodded. \u201cI had a business in Eugene for years,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, I can\u2019t take the car all the way to Eugene for you, but there are good shops in Bandon, North Bend, Coquille or Thunder Point. There\u2019s a motel in Thunder Point\u2014not fancy, but clean and nice. And I can take care of the car tomorrow. I can send someone for the right tires, take a look at your undercarriage, brakes and other essentials. I can even do the body work, but you might want to get closer to home for that, once the car is drivable. If so, I can get you some pictures for your damages report.\u201d Then he ducked slightly to see the woman\u2019s face. She was looking down but lifted her face briefly. \u201cYou want someone to look at that, ma\u2019am?\u201d</p><p>She just shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs the police department going to pony up for the repairs?\u201d the man asked, an obvious edge to his voice.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to work that out with them. Why don\u2019t I get this car up the hill while you talk to that man over there,\u201d he said. He indicated to Mac and pulled some gloves out of his pocket. Then he lifted the brim of his hat to look at the man. \u201cLet\u2019s just get you back on the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kind of cheerful for the middle of the night,\u201d the man said sourly. \u201cBig commission here?\u201d he suggested.</p><p>Eric smiled. He was cheerful all right and it had nothing to do with the money he\u2019d make on this tow. \u201cI\u2019m on call to local and county police. As a matter of fact, they woke me up from a very good dream. Now if you\u2019ll talk over where you want me to take your vehicle and move to the other side of the road, I\u2019ll get to work. By the time you decide where you\u2019re spending the rest of the night, I\u2019ll have her loaded on the rig.\u201d</p><p>He positioned and braced the wrecker at the side of the road. Using a large flashlight, he moved cautiously down the hill. It wasn\u2019t too rocky; he wedged a boulder out of the way. Examining the car, he found some surprising things. Only one tire was flat and though it was dark, it didn\u2019t appear to be a puncture. There were plenty of scratches and dents, with a small amount of fuel leaking on the ground and dripping into the creek. The chances were excellent that the tank had been nearly empty, but Eric had an industrial-strength fire extinguisher handy on the chance of a spark. The car was lying on the driver\u2019s side, so he pointed the flashlight inside the passenger\u2019s open door and looked inside.</p><p>He didn\u2019t think this vehicle was going to cost the cops any money.</p><p>He laid out his chains and cable, then he walked over to Mac. \u201cListen, it\u2019s none of my business, but...\u201d</p><p>Mac smiled. \u201cWhat are all these folks doing out here between two and four a.m. on a back road? Curious, I agree. That young lady over there works the night shift in a nursing home and was feeling sick, so she left work early. The gentleman over there\u2014fisherman. He wants to be on his boat by four. The couple with the SUV and back full of luggage are heading home from a visit. Seems kind of late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots of breath mints at work there,\u201d Eric said. \u201cNo punctured tires, wife or girlfriend with a nasty bruise...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said she hit it on the steering wheel.\u201d</p><p>Eric shook his head. \u201cThe driver\u2019s seat\u2019s way back. She\u2019s not even five and a half feet. There\u2019s paint on the guardrail, over there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said she was avoiding the stop sticks and went off the road.\u201d</p><p>Eric shook his head. \u201cI think if you could see and avoid stop sticks, the police would find a better option for disabling a runaway car. But this isn\u2019t my business. You\u2019ll figure it out....\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you think you know what happened?\u201d</p><p>Eric looked upward and put his hands in his pockets. \u201cThe bruise on the woman\u2019s face bothers me a lot. Looks like she got coldcocked.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cMaybe she had to put the seat back to get out of the vehicle?\u201d</p><p>Eric gave that thought little time. \u201cAnything\u2019s possible, I guess, except the car\u2019s on the driver\u2019s side and it would be hard to reach the controls, but the passenger\u2019s seat is forward,\u201d he said. His gut told him the man was driving, at least a little drunk, got into it with the woman and during a fight that got physical, saw cars stopped right ahead, right in front of him, and swerved, going off the road. He hadn\u2019t made it to the stop sticks. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I just load that car while you think about it.\u201d</p> <p>He had a feeling he\u2019d be taking it to an impound lot.</p><p>Six</p><p>Eric sent Laine a text at 6:30 a.m. to say he was back at the service station. And that he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about her. He didn\u2019t call because he didn\u2019t want to wake her and didn\u2019t ask if he could come over, even though the thought of curling around her warm body was enough to get him excited. Instead, he changed his clothes and prepared to work at least through the morning. He could call her later, maybe set up something for the evening. But waiting was hard. He wanted to get back into that soft bed. Now.</p><p>While he was still alone at the station, when no one could observe his silent struggle, he tried having a conversation with himself about exactly what kind of relationship he thought this might be, where it could go, what he should do with it.</p><p>Then he told himself to shut up. Who the hell cared? Everything he felt when he thought of her was good. God, they fit together perfectly. They had all the same moves. Only a stupid fool would look that gift horse in the mouth.</p> <p>Besides, he had work to do. The police had impounded the SUV with one blown tire but Eric inherited the small truck the early morning fisherman was driving. The deputy gave the fisherman a lift to North Bend and Eric had to find four new tires. He couldn\u2019t wait to hear what happened to the couple with the SUV. Though he believed he knew.</p><p>To his surprise, Justin showed up at seven. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Eric asked.</p><p>The kid kept his head down, which was typical Justin fashion. \u201cMy mom didn\u2019t feel so good so she decided to skip church. I called Norm and told him I could handle the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with your mom?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cJust a bug,\u201d Justin said. \u201cNo biggie. My brothers are home if she needs anything.\u201d</p><p>This wasn\u2019t the first time Justin\u2019s mom had needed him because she wasn\u2019t feeling well. \u201cSeems like she\u2019s sick a lot,\u201d Eric said.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s a little sickly, yeah, but she\u2019s tough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs your dad around to help?\u201d Eric asked.</p><p>Justin gave a short huff of laughter and averted his eyes. \u201cThey\u2019ve been divorced since I was twelve. He doesn\u2019t come around.\u201d</p><p>Eric hadn\u2019t known that. It hadn\u2019t occurred to him to ask. \u201cThat puts a lot of responsibility on you and your brothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re up to it,\u201d Justin said, moving away to get one of the work suits off a peg to put on over his blue shirt and pants. Eric was a real stickler about clean work clothes and Justin\u2019s were always perfect\u2014clean and pressed. His mother was consistent about that much. That was a good sign.</p><p>\u201cYour mom work?\u201d Eric asked.</p><p>Justin shook his head. \u201cYou turn on the pumps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you can manage, I should find some tires for this truck. I\u2019m going to put it up on the lift then drive to Bandon.\u201d</p> <p>Justin frowned. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Eric explained about the stop sticks and for the first time since he\u2019d hired Justin, the kid almost laughed his ass off. He thought it was hilarious that the police screwed up and Eric began to wonder if Justin had a problem with cops. It wouldn\u2019t surprise him; he was a surly kid. But he took the bonding moment to laugh with him.</p><p>\u201cWill they get fired? The cops?\u201d Justin asked.</p><p>\u201cNah. But their department will have to pay for the repairs. And I imagine they\u2019ll have great drama about it. Could be some punishments involved. So, you ever see him? Your dad?\u201d</p><p>Justin sobered and glared at Eric. \u201cHe left us. Why would I want to see him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotcha,\u201d Eric said. \u201cListen, I don\u2019t have a lot of practice at this, but if there\u2019s ever anything you need that you\u2019d, ah, ordinarily ask a father for, you can always try me. I\u2019m a helpful guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI have a seventeen-year-old daughter,\u201d he reminded Justin.</p><p>\u201cRight. I\u2019m good.\u201d And then he turned away to get busy cleaning up around the pumps and in the garage.</p><p>\u201cWell, that was awkward,\u201d Eric said quietly to himself.</p><p>Justin had worked for him for a couple of months and he was dependable, but ornery. Eric had suspected there were problems at home but he had no idea what kind. A single mother was a hint; they were probably under a lot of pressure. But it seemed like at least once a week his mother was sick. Maybe she was a drunk, Eric thought. Maybe she was chronically depressed. Whatever it was, it wasn\u2019t doing positive things for Justin\u2019s attitude.</p><p>Justin was a high school senior and one of the drawbacks to hiring high school students was having their buddies turning the station into a hangout, so Eric had warned Justin not to let that happen. Justin had said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about that, man.\u201d It was a nonissue. When high schoolers came by to get gas, they barely passed words with Justin. Maybe the kid was just real unpopular.</p><p>Eric thought he\u2019d ask Mac. Mac knew everyone. Then he told himself that might piss off Justin. But Justin was already pissed off. Was it his business? The kid was seventeen and on the brink of adulthood. But that was right about the age Eric had decided he knew more than anyone else, dropped out of school, got a girl pregnant, threw in with a bad crowd and eventually ended up in prison. And he thought he might have looked and acted a lot like Justin.</p><p>He had no experience with this. So he drove to Bandon to get tires. He put them on, balanced them, checked the undercarriage, looked for damage, then he called Mac.</p><p>Eric drove the truck to the North Bend marina and Mac was waiting there in the parking lot to give him a lift home. He left the invoice in the glove box and left the key with a guy named Sammy at the gas pump on the pier.</p><p>\u201cYou were right about the SUV,\u201d Mac said. \u201cI should get you signed up for the police academy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe background check might not go so well,\u201d Eric said.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t even his wife. His wife thought he was on a business trip\u2014he sells something. I think he said paint. Or maybe it was manure...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you get paint and manure mixed up?\u201d Eric asked.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my case. Not really. But I tipped off the state police. Well, I passed them off to my uncle-in-law, Joe, who took over. So, they were at some hideaway down the coast, got into a fight, headed back up the coast, still fighting. Not only did he hit her in the face, she broke right there and said she had bruises on her arms from him grabbing her and shaking her and shit. He passed a Breathalyzer, but barely. But the woman had had enough and sold him out. He went to jail on battery charges. I\u2019d love to be a fly on the wall when he calls his wife for bail....\u201d Then Mac laughed. Evilly.</p><p>It was midafternoon by the time Eric got back to the station. Manny was there, prepping a car for a paint job. An old car with salt damage from the ocean. Not a classic, but give it a few years. He had discussed the painting service and the only way they could make money, be competitive, was to use cheap paint, but Eric wouldn\u2019t have a car he painted chip and peel two years out so he used good paint and made less money. His name was on it, after all.</p><p>Manny had one of his sons with him\u2014twelve-year-old Robbie. He had four sons and two daughters ranging in age from sixteen to four. When he worked weekends he almost always had at least one kid with him. Manny had the most respectful, well-behaved kids Eric had ever known.</p><p>He talked with Manny for about ten minutes, told him about the tow, asked if his wife would bring him dinner. And Manny said, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to get calls for tows, especially from the sheriff, you gotta get yourself a night man. Go get a nap, boss. See you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Eric didn\u2019t schedule himself to work nights, but he was there most of the time anyway. This weekend was a real anomaly\u2014a date Friday night, a bigger date Saturday night, a lot of hopefulness for Sunday night. He walked down the hill the few short blocks to Laine\u2019s house and knocked on her front door. She opened it and smiled at him. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I go catch a nap and call you later. Maybe I can take you out for something to eat tonight?\u201d he said.</p><p>She reached for his hand and pulled him inside. \u201cYou must be so tired,\u201d she said.</p><p>His arms went around her automatically. \u201cSomeone kept me up most of the night.\u201d</p><p>She pushed him away. \u201cYou said it was the sheriff\u2019s deputy.\u201d She laughed. \u201cCome on,\u201d she said, pulling on his hand. \u201cCome in here. It\u2019s a lazy Sunday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor you, maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLazy Sundays really don\u2019t feel the same when you don\u2019t work all week.\u201d</p><p>The fire was lit and she pushed him down on the couch in front of it. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be good company, Laine. I\u2019m shot. But I could\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLay back on those pillows,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the best couch in the world. When I was buying a couch I had very high standards\u2014I lived alone and needed something that would embrace me. Do you want something to drink? A hot chocolate? A Coke? How about tea? Milk?\u201d</p><p>He leaned back and the soft cushions seemed to wrap around him. \u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying\u2014perfect, right?\u201d She sat down at the other end and lifted his feet one at a time, unlacing and removing his boots. \u201cNo shoes or boots allowed on my baby. Tell me about the tow and the cops. Tell me everything. From the beginning.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI was born in the house my father built....\u201d</p><p>She gave him a whack. \u201cStarting with the text.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Mac was throwing me a bone. They needed three wreckers, had massive tire damage and they were midway between Thunder Point and Bandon. My daughter\u2019s stepdad is lending a hand, I bet.\u201d He yawned. \u201cBut it was interesting because I was the guy with the side puller who could get an SUV up the hill and it turned out they weren\u2019t a victim of the stop sticks, but were having a domestic in the car. We won\u2019t get the exact details but she was bruised and upset, he was a little bit drunk and they didn\u2019t hit the spikes. I bet he slugged her and swerved onto the shoulder, lost control and flipped the car. Why would a guy do that?\u201d he asked, still bewildered. He yawned again. \u201cThe other two were innocent victims of stop sticks\u2014one was a nurse\u2019s aide and there was a fisherman. I got the SUV up for \u2019em, but then I took the fisherman\u2019s truck in for tires and a check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the couple?\u201d</p><p>She was rubbing his feet. His toes curled inside his white socks. He smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re like a fantasy woman, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know. And the couple?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think they\u2019re in trouble. Mac had their vehicle impounded. And he hopes the guy has to call his wife for a ride home from jail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t married?\u201d she asked. \u201cHe was slugging his mistress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe not even a mistress. Maybe not a whole lot more than a date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat an idiot. Didn\u2019t he realize she didn\u2019t have that much to lose? I mean, if she wasn\u2019t the wife, if she wasn\u2019t invested, if he abused her or misled her, she\u2019d flip on him in a second. She wasn\u2019t going to jail. Stupid ass. Talk about job security\u2014most bad guys are just too dumb for words.\u201d</p><p>Eric smiled. Spoken like a true cop. And he yawned. She\u2019d done a very good job on this couch purchase. And he heard her talking about dividing couples to question them about what really happened.... He loved the sound of her voice, so he closed his eyes for just a second. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>When he opened his eyes, the house was dark except for the fireplace and one light across the room. There, in the big chair close to the fireplace, she was curled up, reading a book. One standing lamp, positioned behind the chair, was shining down on her golden hair and the book. Sometimes she bit on a nail as she read; sometimes she frowned a little bit, then turned the page. He wondered what time it was, but didn\u2019t want to look at his watch. He didn\u2019t move because moving would alert her and watching would come to an end. But what time was it when he dropped by? Two? Three? He had closed his eyes for a second and it had been hours.</p><p>His stomach growled and she looked up. She smiled at him. He smiled back and realized she\u2019d covered him with a throw from the couch.</p> <p>Laine unfolded herself from the chair and went to him, crawling right onto him, looking down into his eyes. \u201cWell, Mr. Gas Man, you have a little nap?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cPlease tell me that\u2019s in reference to my service station uniform....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you do snore. But it\u2019s kind of adorable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if I\u2019m on my back. You did very well on couch selection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know. I told you\u2014it has to hug you. Feeling better? Besides being hungry?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI forgot to eat. I got busy. Did I fall asleep while you were talking? Because that\u2019s very rude and besides, I love to listen to you talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou missed a discourse on interrogation 101. It was fascinating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet it was,\u201d he said, smoothing her hair back over her ear. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix-thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should get a shower....\u201d</p><p>\u201cUpstairs?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>He shook his head. \u201cWhere I have a change of clothes. If you invite me to come back, I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you bring a pizza?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s really what you have to have. Otherwise, I\u2019ll bring something that\u2019s not fast food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cBe surprised. I won\u2019t disappoint you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do like pizza,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I also like some of your surprises, though so far they haven\u2019t had anything to do with food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re coming on to me again,\u201d he said. She nodded and smiled. \u201cI like it. Let me up\u2014I want to make it a fast shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou walked here, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s only a few blocks, but I\u2019ll drive back here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake my car,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd bring your morning work clothes because I already know, you work every day and you\u2019re on call every night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I want to sleep in my own bed?\u201d he asked, but he smiled teasingly.</p><p>\u201cLast I heard, you didn\u2019t have your own bed. You have a room with a bed in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I also have a small refrigerator and a toaster. It\u2019s very comfort\u2014 Okay, I almost said comfortable, which it barely is. And compared to your bed, which includes that nice, warm, soft body\u2014no contest.\u201d Then his expression grew serious. \u201cLaine, you don\u2019t have to let me stay the night every time we\u2019re together. I know you\u2019ve lived alone, slept alone. You won\u2019t injure my male pride if you tell me to go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDitto. If you want to leave, I\u2019m not taking hostages.\u201d Then she grinned at him. \u201cI like it, though. Not something I\u2019ve done much of. You must be a nice sleeper.... Or something...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI snore when I\u2019m on my back....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Eric called Cliffhanger\u2019s at the marina before he got into the shower and ordered takeout. He stopped in on his way back to Laine\u2019s and saw four people he knew while he picked up his clam chowder and Crab Louie for two. Mac, Gina, Cooper and Sarah all sat in the bar area and after saying hello, they exchanged glances in a very all-knowing and superior fashion. They said nothing besides hello; he admitted to nothing. And yet, he didn\u2019t doubt for a second that even with neither himself nor Laine saying a word, everyone who didn\u2019t know about them soon would.</p><p>While he\u2019d been gone, Laine had fed the fire, put on music and set a table. There were place mats, cloth napkins and even a candle. And she was pleased with what he chose for them. The clam chowder came in a takeout carton, but included were Cliff\u2019s sourdough bread bowls, which she loved. \u201cOne of these days I\u2019m going to make this\u2014bread bowls. But maybe for my steak soup or chili. I love bread bowls!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteak soup?\u201d he asked hopefully.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting that look again,\u201d she teased. \u201cI\u2019ll make it for you on the next really good soup day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love soup days,\u201d he said. In fact, he loved it all\u2014her couch, her soup, her sweet body, her passion, the sound of her voice, the blue of her eyes...</p><p>She dished everything up, tossing the disposable containers in the trash in the garage, hiding them from view. And while they ate, she talked about food, about how she had lived for those days her mother came home from work early and spent a few hours in the kitchen, preparing her favorite meals. Laine loved to sit on one of the stools at the kitchen counter and watch her mother prepare food. That\u2019s when they had their best talks about cooking, school, friends, plans, boys... Anything from karate to horses to colleges. It was never planned. In fact, there were times her mother had canceled evening plans because her meal was more important, just as there were times everyone else in the family was busy\u2014but that didn\u2019t deter her. She made the meal, robust enough to feed as many as showed up, even if she had to eat it alone and refrigerate the rest. She loved the aromas and the science of it. The work and the flavors relaxed her.</p><p>\u201cShe was a plastic surgeon,\u201d Laine told him. \u201cShe did wonderful work and was completely dedicated. By the time I was twelve and she was fifty, she had cut back on her hours somewhat. She didn\u2019t want to miss our adolescence. She loved her work, but she said that there was lots of time to work. She wanted to see our plays and games and meets and competitions. She wanted to be around when we were struggling with our choices, like colleges and professions. And thank God, because Senior had a one-track mind. We were both supposed to be doctors. Period.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s not the way you went,\u201d Eric said.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cAnd then to further upset him, I didn\u2019t choose a career as an attorney after a degree in criminal justice. I wanted to catch crooks. He\u2019s very disappointed in me. My whole life he always said, \u2018Good job, Pax,\u2019 and \u2018Laine, not like that\u2014like this!\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a fool,\u201d Eric said.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re a crook!\u201d she said, clearly baiting him. \u201cAnd look\u2014I caught you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, I never wanted to take from people or hurt anyone. I was just a self-indulgent idiot. It\u2019s a lot harder to recover from being an idiot than from being a crook. I deserved what I got, but I was just stupid. Not evil. Have you been around some evil?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome. A lot more idiots...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHopefully I\u2019ve learned. I take it your mother was encouraging.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was. She loved the idea of what I was doing. It scared her, but she loved it. And she loved Pax\u2019s decision to go to medical school just as much. She had very few vetoes in her. She was so supportive, but more important, she was interested. She was fascinated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you lost her....\u201d</p><p>Her chin dropped. She put down her fork. She nodded solemnly. \u201cPancreatic cancer, the devil. She had very few symptoms\u2014some heartburn, an occasional pain. She didn\u2019t pay too much attention since her life was hectic and stressed, and don\u2019t kid yourself, standing in an operating room isn\u2019t easy work. Then she passed out at work, had a battery of tests.... She told herself they were ruling out the gallbladder, but the diagnosis was advanced cancer with metastasis to other organs and bones. We were right up against the end. Of course, we tried everything, but she slipped away from us very quickly. And, as is often the case, the treatment appeared worse than the disease and she stopped. She said \u2018enough!\u2019\u201d</p><p>Laine gave a huff of sad laughter and said, \u201cRight up to the very last weeks she wanted me to tell her FBI stories. She loved them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you told her?\u201d he said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my mother!\u201d she said. \u201cI told her anything she wanted. Not just my experiences, but cases I was peripherally involved in, just the drama and chaos and hilarity of it all. Very entertaining stuff.\u201d She picked up her fork and smiled again.</p><p>\u201cMaybe someday you\u2019ll tell me stories.\u201d</p><p>She put a bite of Crab Louie into her mouth. \u201cWhen I get your security clearance.\u201d</p><p>A few hours later, Laine was gasping, panting, sighing in Eric\u2019s arms. \u201cOh, God,\u201d she said in a weak breath. \u201cHave you always been this good at sex?\u201d</p><p>He kissed her forehead, her nose, her chin. \u201cI think maybe I\u2019ve been underappreciated. Or it\u2019s you and you just think it\u2019s me. That\u2019s more likely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t even describe what you...\u201d</p><p>When she didn\u2019t finish he said, \u201cYou make me feel that, too. Be careful, Laine. You could be stuck with me longer than you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust do it again,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI let you nap. It\u2019s only sleep....\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, man,\u201d he whispered. \u201cOh, man...\u201d</p><p>Eric tried to keep his mind focused on his work and his hands busy, but his thoughts strayed to Laine at all hours of the day. He felt like a fifteen-year-old boy who\u2019d just discovered girls. He had to work at keeping dopey song lyrics from passing his lips. And it wasn\u2019t easy, which only reminded him how totally uncool he was.</p><p>Neither were his hours easy. Until he began seeing Laine, he hadn\u2019t minded making sure that the service station opened early and stayed open late, tow truck on call 24/7. Now he had to do two important things\u2014hire one more person immediately and adjust the schedule to make sure he had three nights off a week. Justin, greedy for hours, was more than happy to work until 11:00 p.m., but Eric wasn\u2019t about to leave a minor in charge alone so late. It was a safe town and there was always a deputy somewhere nearby, but it was too much responsibility. He usually got one of the old boys\u2014Norm or Howie\u2014to stay with Justin when he worked late. Eric didn\u2019t mind manning the pumps himself but if someone else did that he could concentrate on mechanics or body work.</p><p>On the nights Eric worked late he snuck like a prowler into Laine\u2019s house. They\u2019d been together every night since that first night.</p><p>\u201cI feel creepy doing this,\u201d he told her. \u201cLike a man who can\u2019t get enough of his woman. I should leave you alone some nights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like that you can\u2019t get enough,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m perfectly capable of tossing you out if I don\u2019t want you here. Remember, I\u2019m a black belt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never make you throw me out. All you have to do is tell me to go home.\u201d</p><p>However hard it was to keep from constantly thinking about her or sneaking to her in the dark of night, he was determined to do two important things\u2014keep his business growing and spend time with Ashley. This was her last year of high school and he\u2019d barely found her.</p><p>It was Eric\u2019s night for closing the station so he had a late lunch at the diner. He wanted to be there when the place was quiet and Ashley arrived after school to work her shift. When he ordered his sandwich he told Gina he was hoping to catch their daughter to find out what was new in her life. He was just finishing his food when Ashley came in. Just the sight of her filled him with pride. And gratitude to Gina for all the sacrifices she\u2019d made to bring her up right. It didn\u2019t hurt a bit to see she smiled just as broadly at him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cLet me change clothes. Then I\u2019ll sit a few minutes until the after-school crowd descends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust what I was hoping,\u201d he said.</p> <p>She took his empty plate with her when she went back through the kitchen on her way to the bathroom to change. Just minutes later she brought herself a soda and slid in across from him. \u201cHow\u2019re things?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cGood. But that\u2019s my question for you. Have you given any more thought to U of Oregon? We could drive up to see it, talk to someone there.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cI\u2019m set for now. Besides, I\u2019ve seen the campus. I\u2019ve gone to see some games\u2014you\u2019re right, it\u2019s a great place. But I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill planning on community college?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good decision. I\u2019m not ready to commit to a four-year program yet. I want to dip in, work part-time, live at home for now. I have to give some more thought to what I want to study.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs long as it doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the cost of tuition because I said I can help with that. I want you to feel like you can stretch if you want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m stretching,\u201d she said. \u201cYou aren\u2019t trying to get me out of town, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not! Eugene isn\u2019t that far!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut now you have a girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>He was shocked. He shouldn\u2019t have been. He\u2019d known from the first date this would be all over town.</p><p>\u201cEric,\u201d she said, laughing at him. \u201cYou have a girlfriend. A nice girlfriend.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m in denial,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Aren\u2019t you ready for a girlfriend? Too soon after being dumped by the computer geek?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cTo my embarrassment, that wasn\u2019t serious. It should\u2019ve been, since we lived together, but really...\u201d He cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I never met her,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cThen maybe I\u2019d understand why you were never brokenhearted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCara\u2019s a great girl. You would\u2019ve liked her,\u201d he said. \u201cBut she wanted someone entirely different and I understood. It was time to move on. That\u2019s why we never got serious, I guess. And now...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re hooked up with the mystery woman,\u201d Ashley said.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>Ashley just laughed again. \u201cGimme a break, Eric. Computer researcher? For some agency? Good friends with a woman who was in a cult for years before she escaped with her daughter? I should say barely escaped. And later both of them had to be rescued?\u201d</p> <p>He could feel his eyes grow about as large as hubcaps.</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d Ashley said. \u201cYou bought all that research stuff?\u201d</p><p>He thought she did investigative research for the FBI and he was keeping a tight lid on that, per her instructions. He knew she probably went out on search warrants from time to time or something. What was this cult and rescue stuff? \u201cI don\u2019t like to pry,\u201d he said evasively. \u201cAnd apparently I don\u2019t get much gossip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably because you\u2019re always under the hood of a car. Haven\u2019t you wondered about her?\u201d</p><p>He just shook his head. \u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah! Not that she isn\u2019t well-liked. Everyone likes her a lot because she\u2019s very cool. And she\u2019s tight with Cooper and Spencer and Rawley, who just happen to be the three guys who staged a big rescue to get Devon\u2019s three-year-old out of that cult after she was kidnapped. Come on, Eric,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cYour girlfriend is some kind of secret operative. She can probably build a car out of her cell phone or something.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed with a gulp. \u201cKidnapped? Operative?\u201d He gave his head a shake. \u201cJesus. So what are people saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean guessing?\u201d</p><p>He just nodded stupidly.</p><p>\u201cWell, like she\u2019s undercover. Or in the witness protection program. Or she was a cult member who\u2019s going to testify against the ones who got away. Or that she\u2019s on the run, hiding from bad guys. Or maybe she\u2019s a computer researcher, but that\u2019s so boring. And she just doesn\u2019t seem boring. Have you checked to see if she has a Wonder Woman outfit in her glove box? Because I bet she is\u2014Wonder Woman. Or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit,\u201d he said before he could stop himself. He looked up and colored a little. After all, this was his daughter!</p><p>But she didn\u2019t seem embarrassed. \u201cNot boring, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s amazing,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut I bet she doesn\u2019t know the town is talking about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because she stands out. Not in a bad way. Laine seems totally cool.\u201d Then she got a little serious. \u201cI\u2019m glad you like someone, Eric. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve liked many women since you got out of prison.\u201d</p><p>He looked down. He could say those words pretty easily but it still filled him with shame when Ashley said them. After all, he\u2019d never been there for her. He gave her a biological father she should probably be ashamed of. He wished, for her sake, he\u2019d learned about her after becoming a Rhodes scholar or something. \u201cNot many.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd apparently no one special,\u201d she said.</p><p>He met her eyes. Green on green. She was so intuitive. So smart and empathetic.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very accomplished in the skill of identifying and avoiding potential problems. Now, that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you found yourself a woman who could shake up your world?\u201d She didn\u2019t wait for him to answer. \u201cAwesome. I have to get to work. Listen, I\u2019m set with school. I\u2019ve been planning very well and I looked at all the internet links you sent me and I appreciate it a lot. And your offer is very nice. I might take you up on some help\u2014I hear the cost of books is just deadly. For right now, I\u2019m all set.\u201d She winked at him and flashed him a smile. \u201cAnd I\u2019m glad you have a cool girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said.</p><p>She laughed a little more. \u201cYou\u2019re so cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be cute,\u201d he said.</p><p>Seven</p><p>Eric was restless and troubled through the rest of the afternoon. He needed to talk to Laine, to understand a few things about her, like what it really meant for her to be an FBI agent. It wasn\u2019t like he never watched TV, but he just assumed she didn\u2019t punch the clock and go to work like the NCIS team did. It was one thing for the rest of the town to speculate and he was fine with not knowing all the finer details, but still...they were lovers. And Eric was surprised to realize he was a little old-fashioned. He thought lovers should be straight with each other. He\u2019d been straight with her. She should tell him what her job really meant.</p><p>Justin had come in at 4:00 p.m. and at five Eric asked, \u201cWill you be all right here for an hour or so if I step out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIf you have any problems or questions, my cell is on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax, man. I\u2019m just pumping gas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPay attention, Justin. If anyone gives you any trouble...\u201d</p><p>Justin straightened, insulted. \u201cI can handle it for an hour, man.\u201d</p><p>Even though it was misty and the sun was lowering, dropping the temperature even more, Eric walked to Laine\u2019s house. He hoped the cold, damp air would clear his mind. He was worried about how she\u2019d respond to his questions. After all, she\u2019d implied this business of hers was classified, that she couldn\u2019t talk about it. Did that mean even if the town was speculating? When she answered the door she had a paintbrush in her hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came to ask you something. What are you painting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe backsplash behind the stove. I thought you worked tonight.\u201d She stepped back so he could come in.</p><p>\u201cI have to go right back. I just want to talk to you about something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot,\u201d she invited, heading for the kitchen to put down her brush.</p><p>Eric stood on the other side of the breakfast bar until she came back around. Then he threw it out there. \u201cAre you in the witness protection program?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d she asked with a sharp laugh. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, were you in a cult?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEric, what\u2019s going on?\u201d she asked much too calmly.</p><p>\u201cPeople are curious about you. Talking. Trying to guess what you\u2019re about. I didn\u2019t hear FBI agent, but I heard operative. Spy kind of stuff. They\u2019re making connections. Between you, a kidnapping, a rescue, a cult. What the hell, Laine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEric, I told you. I\u2019m an agent. I\u2019m a field agent. I don\u2019t talk about my cases.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding! What does that mean\u2014you\u2019re an agent? Other people know things\u2014apparently some people around here are in on it. And I\u2019ve been having scary pictures in my head all afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of pictures?\u201d she asked, hands on her hips.</p><p>\u201cPictures of you facing off with bad people, vulnerable, in danger. Somehow when you told me you worked for the FBI all that stuff didn\u2019t pop into my head. I thought you filed stuff or looked up stuff. But scary pictures are there now. What are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrap,\u201d she said, running a hand through her hair. \u201cAll right, this is need-to-know, okay? The case isn\u2019t closed, though our primary suspect is dead. But there are still loose ends to wrap up. So, I was on an assignment, which is how I met Devon. I was undercover. Only the third time I\u2019ve done a deep-cover assignment, which means \u2018live the role.\u2019 And it stretched out way longer than we expected. It was a mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a cult?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cIt was a commune, really. A farm. A kind of loose religious order without much religion. Or order, for that matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you end up there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked for it. I looked the part\u2014our suspect liked young blue-eyed blondes. I look younger than I am. I thought I could do it if we created the right backstory. And as it turned out...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d he said. \u201cYou asked for it?\u201d</p><p>She gave a nod. \u201cI had to give the pitch of a lifetime to get it. Our bad guy was recruiting young women to make a part of his \u2018family.\u2019 He found them when they were down on their luck, rescued them, then held them against their will. We knew he was working on his antigovernment manifesto, spewed a lot of violent-sounding, antiestablishment rhetoric\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when is antiestablishment rhetoric against the law?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen it\u2019s accompanied by threats, human trafficking and the purchase of large quantities of fertilizer\u2014the kind used to make bombs. Since they were running an organic farm, we were concerned about the commercial fertilizer. We already knew he had defrauded charities, didn\u2019t pay taxes, wouldn\u2019t acknowledge law enforcement and kept his commune surrounded by a locked fence guarded by a few armed men. He was suspected of plotting domestic terrorism and I was part of a counterterrorism task force. Some of his clan had gotten away and tipped the police. He hadn\u2019t been real violent, according to the reports, but the potential was escalating. He was escalating.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cWe had to get ahead of it. Before he blew something up.\u201d</p><p>Eric wiped a hand down his face. \u201cI think I better sit down,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cTake it easy, it was expertly planned. And it wasn\u2019t what we thought at all. It was a pot farm concealed behind a fake cult. Oh, he was crazy,\u201d she said, following him to the couch. \u201cHe believed all his own B.S. about how he could run his own world, populate it, conceal it and keep it separate from the rest of society. He thought he was creating a peaceful sovereign nation, which of course takes piles of money. Drug money. And it was peaceful, right up to the point when someone disagreed with him\u2014then it was less peaceful. It was when he said the world was going to go up in flames but his family would be safe\u2014someone had to take a closer look.\u201d She stood in front of Eric while he sat. Then she sat down beside him. \u201cHe was the king of his little empire and his fertilizer wasn\u2019t for bombs, it was for marijuana. And he had a few men to guard it and move it. Armed men.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cSo you found out? And left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Eric. There were women and children there. It took me a long time to get the lay of the land, communicate with my team, start evacuating the captives. I didn\u2019t seem to be in immediate danger. And if I had to run, I knew a couple of exit routes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe prevented them from leaving? How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIntimidation, brainwashing, convincing the women they couldn\u2019t legally remove their children. His children. He threatened them, told them if they took his children from him, he wouldn\u2019t rest till he found them. Plus he had his guys, the ones who helped with the heavy chores around the farm. The marijuana grow wasn\u2019t revealed to his female clan, so we hadn\u2019t gotten the word on that until I found it. I think only a couple of them were aware of it. I had to sneak around after dark and peek in open doors and slats in the walls of the barn\u2014it wasn\u2019t easy to find. It was across the river where none of the women went, where Jacob\u2019s house was and the men lived. Till then, we had only heard about his collection of women and children and his determination to keep them inside the fence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about him? Jacob? What did he expect from you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s a little complicated. He thought he was healing me. We built a story about me being a victim of sexual abuse so he would probably understand why I wasn\u2019t willing to be involved with a man. And it worked, thank God. But I had to endure a lot of preaching and his attempts at seduction. Whew. Those were hours that passed like days. I cried a lot, acted vulnerable and grateful, begged, bought time. Some of the other women helped shield me, helped me avoid him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if it hadn\u2019t worked?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou could have been in serious danger.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe planned it for a year. The FBI had watched for longer than that, interviewing people who were closely acquainted with him and his commune. We even tried to get a man inside, but that didn\u2019t work. We just didn\u2019t have a model for the kind of man he wanted to work with. But we understood the women he targeted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was risky,\u201d he said. \u201cVery risky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always risk. Thus the training and planning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could have assaulted you. Raped you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a megalomaniac, but predictable. We didn\u2019t go in there without profiling him\u2014we knew him pretty well. We interviewed a couple of women who left his commune. The women inside talked to each other\u2014they were like a bunch of sister wives. He hadn\u2019t raped anyone as far as anyone knew. But, I knew that going in without a wire or weapon could be dangerous, especially if he found me out. I wasn\u2019t going to let him rape me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he could have.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf he\u2019d had help,\u201d she said with a shrug. \u201cEric, if the whole thing had turned, if he\u2019d used his big armed men to hold me down he could have, but we knew he worked alone with the women. He thought they all loved and adored him. And he was just one man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a spook!\u201d he said.</p><p>She gave a twist of the mouth that said, oh, well. And shrugged.</p><p>\u201cBut why, Laine? Why do you do that stuff? I have to understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it needs to be done! And I\u2019m good at it! If we hadn\u2019t investigated, gone inside, gotten people out, there would still be eight to ten women and as many children in there and he planned to fight to keep his property and his farm and as a last resort, burn the place to the ground and run, leaving the women and children inside!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why didn\u2019t you leave when you found out what you needed to find out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I was in!\u201d She took a breath. \u201cGetting inside wasn\u2019t easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you undercover now? Here?\u201d</p> <p>She gritted her teeth. \u201cI\u2019m on leave. Why are you so upset?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cI knew you worked for the FBI. I didn\u2019t think you were that...that... Thinking of you doing something that dangerous, I guess it just...\u201d He put a hand on her shoulder and ran it down her arm. \u201cWhen I hold you, you seem small against me. You\u2019re soft and pliant and I feel protective and it\u2019s hard for me to imagine...\u201d</p><p>\u201cEric, I\u2019m soft in your arms because I want to be. Not because I\u2019m helpless. Because I like feeling that way with you. Now get a grip. I\u2019m a professional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a big thing for me, getting a picture of you in my head taking on some terrorist. Alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Well, the DEA was a little pissy, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>She gave a shrug and a little snort. \u201cWe\u2019re all a little possessive with cases. Once I found the pot, we could\u2019ve called in DEA but it was our case and we worked it to the end. DEA wasn\u2019t happy about that. Federal agencies are territorial. Everyone wants jurisdiction. In the end a DEA interdiction unit picked up two of our four escaped guys, so they got a piece of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to need a dictionary....\u201d</p><p>\u201cInterdiction unit. They interrupt the trafficking of drugs, humans, weapons, cash\u2014all fuel for more crimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you show me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow you what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow you were trained to defend yourself? Just for my peace of mind? Because I don\u2019t want to have thoughts in my head of anything bad happening to you. And because you\u2019ll go back to that life and I\u2014 Just show me, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEric, nothing bad is going to happen to me. Not here, for God\u2019s sake. I\u2019m on leave....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be on leave forever. I don\u2019t know what I thought you did in the FBI but it wasn\u2019t going undercover against terrorists.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s too much for you, what I do for a living, you can opt out. I told you, I\u2019m not holding you hostage.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cToo late for that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m in. So, can you show me something?\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cAll right, listen. I learned some defensive moves for competition when I was a kid in karate, which is the same as a fair fight and there\u2019s a referee present. But what I learned in training is how to do whatever it takes. If you\u2019re my brother or my boyfriend and you just want to test me, it\u2019s hard to pull off. If you\u2019re a bad guy and you get the jump on me, I\u2019m going to kick you in the balls and rip your ears off and gouge your eyes out. Do you hear me? Do you? Because it\u2019s better if you just take my word for it.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her wrists. Tightly. \u201cJust get out of this for me.\u201d</p><p>She deftly twisted her hands toward his thumbs and pinned his thumbs back, making him yelp. \u201cJesus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA preschooler could have done that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry not to totally emasculate me,\u201d he said, rubbing his thumbs and wrists.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to need a dictionary,\u201d she said, grinning.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m six-two and one-eighty. If I somehow got the slip on you, got you down, covered your little body with mine...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanna go for it, champ?\u201d she asked, lifting a brow.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a little cocky,\u201d he said.</p><p>She lay down on the floor. \u201cTake your time,\u201d she said.</p><p>He studied her position. He really didn\u2019t want to get kicked in the nuts. On the other hand, he wanted assurance that she was capable. Safe. That she could, as she insisted, take care of herself.</p><p>He approached her from the side. Slowly. He covered her small body with his much larger body.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s your plan? You going to suffocate me? Rape me? Beat me?\u201d</p><p>He laced his fingers through hers, hoping to avoid that uncomfortable preschool move. He stretched her arms out, pinning them.</p><p>\u201cVery good, Eric. How are you going to get my pants down?\u201d</p><p>He thought about this for a second, then grasped both of her hands in one of his and lifted himself just slightly. He thought he\u2019d snake one hand down between their bodies just to illustrate that he could, but it never got beyond a thought. She freed her hands, socked him in the jaw and from nowhere her legs came up from beneath them, wrapped around his torso and, with amazing strength, she flipped him off her. He landed with an oomph, flat on his back. Then, as fast as greased lightning, she crawled right over his body and kneeled on his arms, pinning him. He could probably get out of this hold, but until he did, her hands were free. And he had grown so attached to his eyeballs.</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d he said, breathless.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea how tired I get of proving myself to the boys?\u201d she asked. And she was not smiling.</p><p>\u201cIn the FBI?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. They know I can take care of myself. We have defensive training courses all the time. Sadly, I haven\u2019t learned how to stop a bullet, but I\u2019m relatively smart and competent in other areas.\u201d</p><p>Relatively, my ass, he thought.</p><p>\u201cRemember, I have a twin brother and he\u2019s big, six feet. Pax now knows size isn\u2019t the key factor so we\u2019ve reached a mutual peace. And I have a father who thinks I\u2019ve lowered my standards to do what I do. I didn\u2019t. It\u2019s hard to do what I do.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cIf I had to, I could fight you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she advised. \u201cStay out of fights. And please, can we be done with this conversation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d it turn out? Your assignment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got them out,\u201d she said. \u201cOnly one wouldn\u2019t leave and it was a sad, tragic decision for her. I\u2019m very unhappy about that\u2014I wanted them all out. And Jacob got himself shot in a standoff with police. But the other women and children are all safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got them out,\u201d he said. He smiled at her. \u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell the town what you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d he promised. \u201cI think they\u2019re figuring it out, though. And someone else might tell.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI have to go back to work. Can I come over tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you behave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI totally had this coming,\u201d he admitted. \u201cYou only look five-foot-four. You\u2019re really very big and scary.\u201d He smiled up at her. \u201cI\u2019m losing the feeling in my hands.\u201d</p><p>She slid her knees off his arms. His arms went around her and rolled with her until he was on top, but he didn\u2019t let all his weight fall on her. It was obvious by the way her hands rested lightly on his shoulders that she acquiesced.</p><p>\u201cFeel better?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cWere you scared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple of times I was terrified, but not so much for myself. I was afraid of not getting them out. I worried about one or more of the kids getting hurt, especially the littlest ones. Scared me to death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s when you got shot, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I never saw him with a gun before. The men who worked for him, yes, and they never threatened anyone with guns. Their guns were for their movement of drugs, not to use against the women. That night he picked it right up off his desk and fired.\u201d She moved her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m good now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must be proud of yourself. I\u2019m proud of you. Scared of you,\u201d he said, smiling, \u201cbut proud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s funny about that. I never quite get there\u2014proud. Even though it was ultimately successful, it was too close. And I lost one. I lost one\u2014that eats at me. I keep going over in my mind how I could have played it smarter, done better. Then I tell myself there\u2019s no point, but I slip back into that old loop\u2014if I\u2019d just done this and not that...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can relate. So can everyone. It\u2019s hard to get to the point of accepting the past as is and remind yourself that everything going forward now counts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd are we going forward?\u201d she asked, her fingertips running through the dark auburn hair over his ears. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cI want to,\u201d Eric said. \u201cIf I can get up, that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPain?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you broke anything,\u201d he said, smiling at her.</p><p>He hoisted himself up and immediately grabbed the small of his back. Then he grinned into her shocked face and held out a hand to help her to her feet. \u201cI lock up at around eleven. I\u2019ll grab a shower and come over after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a shower,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll be up.\u201d</p><p>Laine texted her brother. If you\u2019re still awake, can you talk?</p><p>An hour later, 9:00 p.m. her time, her cell rang. It was midnight in Boston.</p> <p>\u201cAre you in trouble?\u201d was his first question.</p><p>\u201cGet serious. Why would I text you if I was in trouble? I\u2019d call the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis kind of text\u2014I don\u2019t get this from you. Where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m home! How come you\u2019re up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had surgery and I\u2019m hanging close to this kid for another couple of hours, so if I hang up on you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a question for you. How did you know you were in love with Genevieve?\u201d</p> <p>He laughed. \u201cShe told me I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you high?\u201d he asked. \u201cI\u2019ve been married for nine years!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill married, you should say. So\u2014how? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaine, you don\u2019t even like her that much! What\u2019s up with this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous\u2014I love her. We\u2019re not close. We have nothing in common. We\u2019re not alike, but I...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, let me take another angle. You don\u2019t care why I love my wife. You\u2019re a wonderful sister, a spectacular aunt, a good and faithful friend, but I think if you had your way, you\u2019d find me a different wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave I been that bad?\u201d she asked, suddenly ashamed of her behavior toward her sister-in-law. She\u2019d never been cruel but no one knew better than Laine how to create emotional distance. Besides, Genevieve didn\u2019t need her. She had her own sisters. But still, Laine had kept her at arm\u2019s length.</p> <p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t exactly bonded with Genevieve,\u201d Pax said. \u201cNow why the question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI think I have a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d Pax said. \u201cIt\u2019s not your first man.\u201d</p><p>A long moment of silence stretched out between them. Finally she said, \u201cHe just about is.\u201d</p><p>Pax cleared his throat. \u201cOkay. Well, here\u2019s how it happened. I was a med student. She was involved in some fund-raiser for sick kids...she was volunteering or something. I saw her and I tripped. Literally, I fell right into a kitchen cart and sent about twenty dinner trays sailing down the hall.\u201d</p><p>Laine laughed. Genevieve was very pretty, she\u2019d give her that.</p><p>\u201cThe minute I was done helping to clean up and the attending resident was done yelling at me, I talked to her. She was holding a small child who\u2019d had brain surgery and although she talked to me a little bit, she wouldn\u2019t take her attention off that child. But I did get her phone number. I had absolutely no time to date anyone but I wanted to go out with her so bad I couldn\u2019t sleep at night. And I\u2019m all for sleeping when there\u2019s time to sleep. It was killing me\u2014she was killing me. I had to suffer through about ten phone calls and then I had to give her references before she\u2019d date me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReferences?\u201d Laine said with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cYes, references\u2014she wasn\u2019t about to go out with some clumsy stranger without knowing she\u2019d be completely safe. I think you were in the middle of finishing up your master\u2019s or interviewing with the FBI or maybe even in the academy because you were useless to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d she said. \u201cI never gave her enough credit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has a passion for children,\u201d he said almost reverently. \u201cEspecially children in need. She wouldn\u2019t let me distract her from that. I didn\u2019t know I\u2019d be a surgeon at that time. I wasn\u2019t even sure I\u2019d be a pediatrician. That was my goal but Dad was pushing me toward neurosurgery. All that was peripheral\u2014I asked Genevieve to marry me six weeks after our first date. There was just something about the way she hugged me.\u201d</p><p>Laine laughed out loud.</p><p>\u201cSeriously,\u201d he insisted. \u201cShe\u2019s the most nurturing woman. She has compassion to spare\u2014she\u2019s the most supportive woman I know. There\u2019s not a malicious cell in her body. And look at what she\u2019s gotten herself into! A surgeon in a difficult fellowship after both med school and a grueling residency, two kids, a million responsibilities, and yet she\u2019s never too busy or distracted to give me her full attention, to cheer me on....\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d Laine said suddenly. \u201cOh, my God, Pax! You married our mother!\u201d</p><p>Laughter answered her. \u201cYou\u2019re just getting that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why haven\u2019t we been closer?\u201d Laine asked.</p><p>\u201cTwenty reasons, and not entirely your fault, so relax. I don\u2019t blame you and it doesn\u2019t matter. First of all, when we got married, you still had Mom. Mom was your best friend....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were always my best friend....\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot after marrying Genevieve. You had Mom, though. And Genevieve had her own mother and sisters\u2014she\u2019s very close to her family. And you\u2019re right, you\u2019re nothing alike. You\u2019re scrappy and she\u2019s made avoiding conflict a science. She has no trouble telling me what she wants, however. She\u2019s so like Mom\u2014she knows how to smooth things over, make things work, show ways that everyone can be right....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, how did I miss that?\u201d Laine asked.</p><p>\u201cWho cares how? She\u2019s a good woman. I knew that right away. Pretty soon I realized she was like Mom and I appreciated her even more. She\u2019s kind,\u201d Pax said. \u201cWise. She makes me a better father. She tells me when the girls need something so I never fall short with them. I\u2019m telling you, she\u2019s the most giving, nurturing person I know. And trustworthy. I trust her as much as I trust you. She admires you so much, you have no idea....\u201d</p><p>Laine swallowed back some sentimental tears. She coughed. \u201cSo. You knew right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight away. Now tell me, who is this unworthy bastard you think you love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA guy from town. I met him in the first couple of days I was here. He\u2019s very handsome. And funny. And also kind. Thoughtful. But he\u2019s just a mechanic. I mean, he has his own service station and body shop, but he\u2019s basically a wrench. Very smart for a wrench. He must do a lot of reading or something\u2014I\u2019ll look deeper at that. And I don\u2019t love him. I just like him. But a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, has he done anything really special?\u201d Pax asked.</p><p>There were so many ways to answer that. He restored classic cars\u2014he was an artist. He built and sold one successful business and was building a second here in Thunder Point. He just found out he had a child and was stepping up, trying to help her with college. How many men would do that? But what did she say? \u201cHe\u2019s paid his debt to society.\u201d</p><p>Eight</p><p>After a morning jog, Laine stopped into the deputy\u2019s office rather than the diner. Mac was on the phone so she paced by the front door while she waited, hands on her hips, taking slow breaths to even out her ragged breathing. When he finally hung up, he shot her a smile. \u201cWell, hello. I was going to call you this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou first,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Personal business between a couple of cops,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been sort of dating Eric Gentry....\u201d</p><p>Mac\u2019s grin was large. \u201cHow does one \u2018sort of date\u2019 these days?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI doubt that\u2019s changed much over the centuries. So, I know about his history with law enforcement and the judicial system. I was wondering if you\u2019d looked any further. Any deeper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe facts of the case and the trial are public record,\u201d Mac said.</p><p>\u201cI read all that. Thus the question\u2014did you look any further? Earlier issues and associations of his? Problems with the law since? You know...did you run him?\u201d</p><p>Mac leaned forward. \u201cIf he\u2019s not a suspect and if there\u2019s not probable cause, that would be wrong. A private detective could do that without getting in trouble, but our procedure...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet, he\u2019s your stepdaughter\u2019s biological father,\u201d she said, raising one brow.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t let him near Gina or Ashley if I had any doubts about his character,\u201d Mac said. \u201cI\u2019m willing to bet you have good instincts about him or you probably wouldn\u2019t \u2018sort of\u2019 date him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI also have good instincts about my instincts\u2014that is to say, when emotionally involved, I could miss some signals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let me give you some peace of mind here. I didn\u2019t want to like the guy. Really, he did my wife wrong when they were just kids. Her life was harder because of him. And Ashley, as a little girl growing up without a father, had her struggles. The emerging facts are, he was a stupid, reckless ass and made some very large mistakes, for which he\u2019s made amends. And the man he\u2019s become seems to be beyond reproach. Plus, I\u2019m not emotionally involved, my instincts are good and I like him. He does anything to hurt them and I\u2019ll kill him, but I like him.\u201d</p><p>Laine smiled lazily. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not going to rat you out to the sheriff. I just had to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would\u2019ve asked,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>\u201cHe was screwed, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, you read the reports and transcripts. He had inadequate counsel. He was the driver of a car carrying \u2018armed felons\u2019 who weren\u2019t armed and he had no idea anyone had done anything wrong. They were twenty-one\u2014they stopped for beer and Eric was nineteen so he didn\u2019t go in, even the store owner verified that. He assumed they bought the beer. He wasn\u2019t speeding, wasn\u2019t trying to make a fast getaway when the officer made them. He pulled over for the flashing lights. He was unaware of any crime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t get a pass,\u201d Mac said.</p><p>\u201cThe other two got off. One got probation, one got a year, Eric got five to eight and did five and he was the least guilty. Does he know he was screwed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s smart enough to know it didn\u2019t go his way. But he can also figure out that it no longer matters. However unfair that five years might\u2019ve been, some good came of it. He turned his life around, made something of himself. What\u2019s he gonna do about it now, huh? Sue the public defender?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could be bitter,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re close to him,\u201d Mac said. \u201cLet me know if you find bitterness. He seems pretty well adjusted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re a regular ex-con cheerleader. This guy give you money or something?\u201d</p><p>Mac leaned forward. \u201cHe\u2019s what I wish could happen to everyone who stumbles. Look, his crime that night might not have been too dangerous, given there was no real weapon involved, but Eric will tell you himself\u2014he was a badass. He drank and doped and took stupid chances, lucky he didn\u2019t kill himself or anyone else on the road. And he\u2019s what I wish every young man who does time could be\u2014rehabilitated. I don\u2019t have to tell you\u2014it doesn\u2019t usually happen that way. The rate of recidivism is enormous. But Eric got a better life out of it. That\u2019s how it looks. If you\u2019re worried, date someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like him, too,\u201d she said.</p><p>Mac was quiet for a long moment. \u201cLet me know if you need anything.

He\u2019s clean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you ran him! You\u2019d have to!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI hope we can keep this between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely! If I suspected you hadn\u2019t, I was going to find a way. I knew he was okay. I knew it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was going to call you today. About something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said something about working while you\u2019re here. Is that FBI work?\u201d</p> <p>She gave a shrug. \u201cI can do computer research or field investigation for them if they ask. They haven\u2019t asked yet, but I\u2019ve only been here a month or so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDouglas County Sheriff knows you\u2019re here, of course\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made sure the county knows where I am in case they need further interviews or testimony. Just follow-up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInterested in some consulting work?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cDepends. Do you know what it is? Because I\u2019m resting. I\u2019m not infiltrating any cults or communes, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what he wants, exactly. He\u2019s probably going to call you. He mentioned to my boss\u2014who mentioned to me\u2014that if they were looking for someone with federal investigative experience, you were still in the area. And you know how to work with the local cops.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe all know how,\u201d she said, a little irritated by the inference that the fibbies took over. Even though they had earned that reputation very honestly.</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cJust so you know\u2014I think he\u2019ll call you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSide jobs like that while I\u2019m on leave have to be cleared through my division, not his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you can work out details like that. I thought maybe a part-time job could come in handy. Just in case you could use a couple of bucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know what I hear.\u201d</p><p>As it happened, Laine didn\u2019t need money. She had money. She\u2019d always had money. And her mother, Janice, had made sure that upon her death Laine and Pax would have what she referred to as a parting gift. Of course her father, Paxton Sr., was loaded and unless he decided to punish her for disobedience, she\u2019d eventually have a big load of his money dumped on her. Of course, Senior was also young and healthy\u2014seventy, sturdy, strong, robust. Very stubborn. He\u2019d live to be a hundred. And she wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the division of assets favored Pax.</p><p>But Laine had always been very careful not to live rich once she left home. She was also cautious about how she parceled out information about her youth and her parents\u2014it wasn\u2019t typical for an agent to come from wealth. In fact, it was the rare law enforcement officer or agent whose family was stinkin\u2019 rich. It came out, of course. She\u2019d been razzed a little bit about being born with a silver spoon in her mouth, as though that meant she wasn\u2019t clear on how the other half lived, or as if that had anything to do with her ability to do the job well. There had been one agent who called her Duchess. She pretty much wanted to kill him. That guy wasn\u2019t just jealous of the money he thought she had, he was also jealous of her brain. But she was promoted ahead of him and was better respected, so he could go to hell. She lived conservatively; had a modest town house, drove an Acura. An upgraded Acura, but still...</p><p>Here in Thunder Point, they didn\u2019t know.</p> <p>Eric sort of knew. He knew how she\u2019d grown up and easily surmised her childhood was more advantageous than his. But like everything with Eric, he seemed to take it in stride. In fact, his whole existence was that way\u2014just nice and easy. It was as if he knew everyone had baggage and his wasn\u2019t any heavier than what anyone, rich or poor, carried. Maybe that was his trick\u2014if he didn\u2019t make something a big deal, then it wasn\u2019t. It was as if he was in some Zen place with life and the world.</p><p>In fact, the biggest baggage he\u2019d displayed so far was his concern over Laine finding herself in dangerous situations. After throwing him, she hadn\u2019t heard about it again.</p><p>So, Laine didn\u2019t need to earn any money. But there was something she realized she needed after a little more than a month in Thunder Point. She needed something to do. She\u2019d always worked or gone to school or both. Always. And now not only did she have time off, but she also had a man in her life, a man who put in very long hours. If she didn\u2019t find productive ways to fill her days she\u2019d find herself building every second around the reappearance of her man. And she was not that kind of woman.</p><p>Just the suggestion of work lit a fire under her. It was time to get moving again\u2014the shoulder was no longer an excuse. She searched out karate dojos and found that while there were many, she\u2019d probably have to drive to North Bend for the one that appealed to her the most.</p><p>A few days later she went to the Douglas County Sheriff\u2019s Department and found they had a few cases of interstate flight that had gone cold, mostly domestic situations, custodial interference, et cetera. The FBI had bigger fish to fry and would be of little assistance there, but the sheriff wanted to pursue them. Dedicated but boring work, yet something she could do with a minimum of aggravation.</p><p>Getting cleared to consult for the sheriff through her boss started something of a firestorm, however. Her division chief said if she was willing to spend some hours, they had a crunch of background checks in the area they could use help on. So within a week she had a full roster of investigative jobs. And they weren\u2019t all at the computer. She would be needed in the field. Since she hadn\u2019t been firearm-qualified in a long time, she had to get that done. The sheriff\u2019s department was happy to assist.</p><p>Out of the blue her phone rang and caller ID identified Senior. Still angry with him, she flipped him to voice mail. His message was \u201cWhere are you? When will you be home?\u201d She was baffled at the nonchalance and lack of any attempt to apologize. She didn\u2019t respond, of course. Two hours later, Senior called again. Every couple of hours he called, but didn\u2019t leave another message.</p><p>She called her brother. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with Senior? He\u2019s been calling but only left one message, asking where I was and when I\u2019d be home. Like he\u2019s pretending we\u2019re not estranged. Have you talked to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYesterday,\u201d Pax said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t mention you. Are you two ready for a truce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about that. Maybe too much has happened between us. To me all a truce means is that I\u2019m willing to accept his negative attitude toward me and what I do. I can\u2019t change him. I\u2019m happier just being estranged. But will you please do something for me? Will you call him and ask him why he\u2019s calling me? What does he want? Because you can actually talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want. But that doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re through with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d she asked.</p><p>An hour later Pax called her back. \u201cHe said he doesn\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. He hasn\u2019t called you. He asked me to check on you and make sure you\u2019re all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why wouldn\u2019t I be all right? I\u2019m not calling him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Pax said. \u201cI\u2019ll tell him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else did he say?\u201d Laine asked suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cHe said he didn\u2019t...\u201d Pax paused. \u201cHe asked me if you had our mother\u2019s phone and I said of course not. Doesn\u2019t he have it? Did we throw it out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought Senior put it in a drawer or something. We stopped service when she...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen...listen, I don\u2019t know how to say this, Laine. He wondered if you were finally flipping out. He suggested PTSD from all your insane undercover work. His words, not mine.\u201d</p><p>She growled into the phone. \u201cThanks! I\u2019ll be texting you from my new number in the next day or two!\u201d</p><p>Eric was ready to leave the station before Norm arrived to watch over the evening shift. Norm had called to say he was running a little late but would be there by seven. Ordinarily that wouldn\u2019t make any difference. Up until now, there were only two things that mattered a whole lot in Eric\u2019s life\u2014Ashley and the station.</p><p>But now there was Laine. And something had been bothering her the past day or two. When he tried calling her cell the call wouldn\u2019t go through.</p><p>\u201cJust go,\u201d Justin said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to Laine\u2019s, right? Two blocks away? If I have a problem in the next hour, I\u2019ll call you. But I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess it would be okay,\u201d Eric said.</p><p>\u201cYou worry too much, man,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen? Armed bandits? Or maybe you\u2019re afraid I\u2019ll steal from you?\u201d</p><p>Eric frowned. \u201cYou\u2019d do that exactly once,\u201d he said. \u201cActually, I thought something might come up for you, that your mom or brothers might need you for some reason. If that happens, call me. I can be here in five minutes.\u201d</p><p>Justin actually laughed. \u201cThat so? Five minutes? Then your love life is pretty sad. Maybe you need a few pointers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really? Do we need to talk about that?\u201d Eric asked, really hoping the answer was no.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking,\u201d Justin said. \u201cJust trust me\u2014you can\u2019t even compete!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheck,\u201d Eric said. \u201cThe topic of our next weekly meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have weekly meetings!\u201d</p><p>But Eric had accidentally fathered a child, something for which he was grateful now, but that didn\u2019t speak to the fact that it shouldn\u2019t have happened. \u201cWe do now, Casanova. Call me if you need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY\u2019know, if you pay attention you\u2019ll see I can manage nights and weekends just fine. And I could use the hours anyway. In fact, I\u2019m up for learning some more mechanics. Doesn\u2019t that get a little bump in pay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it at our next weekly meeting.\u201d</p><p>Eric stopped off in the washroom to scrub up a little bit. It was a habit. He didn\u2019t go out before making sure there was no grease under his nails. He also washed his face. He used to brush his teeth, but now there was a spare toothbrush in Laine\u2019s bathroom. In fact, a couple of changes of clothes had somehow drifted over to her house. And he had a key for those late nights.</p><p>The French doors were closed against the late February chill, but he could see she was out on the deck, reclining on the chaise, wrapped in a quilt, her fire pit lit against the descending darkness. He moved out onto the deck cautiously. For all he knew, she was armed! As he moved toward her he could see her earbuds in her ears. She was gazing out over the fire toward the bay. He casually stood in front of her.</p><p>\u201cEric!\u201d She pulled out the earbuds. \u201cI\u2019m sorry! I forgot it was your early night!\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her. \u201cThat\u2019s okay, you\u2019ve been preoccupied with something. You look comfortable. And warm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t cook anything,\u201d she said apologetically.</p><p>He moved closer and pushed her feet up so he could sit on the end of the chaise. \u201cYou\u2019re not looking for a man to take care of, remember? I\u2019ll make sure we eat. What\u2019s taking up my space in your brain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsually when you know I\u2019m coming you lay a nice trap for me.\u201d He grinned at her. \u201cThe past couple of days something has been off. You know you aren\u2019t stuck with me. If you need alone time, all you have to do is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re the best part of my day. Every day. It\u2019s not you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanna talk about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d she said with a shrug. \u201cI told you, I\u2019m at odds with my father. I always have been, but it\u2019s worse since my mom died. A couple of days ago he called my cell phone every couple of hours for a whole day and only left one message\u2014asking me where I was and when was I coming home. That\u2019s it. No apology, no asking me to call him, just that one odd message. So I called Pax, asked him to check with Senior, find out why he was calling me. He said he had never called, said I had PTSD from all my \u2018ridiculous undercover work.\u2019\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, baby. He\u2019s a fool. Even if he doesn\u2019t approve, it\u2019s still your choice. You\u2019re all grown up.\u201d He reached out and ran his fingers through her hair over her ear. \u201cHe should know better than to put you down like that. Doesn\u2019t he know it will only build a barrier between you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe should know by now. We had a big blowout at Christmas. What is it about Christmas? Can\u2019t blame it on booze. We\u2019re pretty conservative with liquor, even on holidays. But he started in on how I was wasting my life on scumbags when if I really wanted to make a difference in the world there were better ways. We argued. I mean, we fought. I lashed out at him for his regular if not constant criticism of me and what I do. I was so angry. He was just as angry. It was awful. We weren\u2019t content to just argue over the crime of the moment\u2014we both reached way back in time, remembering every disappointment. My sister-in-law took my nieces into another room!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHoney...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told him I was through listening to his negative, critical remarks, that I was done and he shouldn\u2019t bother to get in touch with me unless he could apologize and change. And then I left Boston in a huff, furious. We haven\u2019t spoken since. When I saw his name on the caller ID I wondered if our two months of not speaking at all had finally...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess it caught up with you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI just got home a couple of hours ago. I went to the phone store\u2014I changed my number. I have a long contact list to go through, a lot of colleagues and supervisors to email. Tomorrow is soon enough. But it was the last straw, Eric. When he suggested my work had made me delusional...\u201d</p><p>He just kept running that hair over her left ear. She looked into her lap, looked at the phone. \u201cGetting a new number is pretty dramatic,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI probably should have done this five years ago. We had a big argument about my work as an agent not long after my mother died. He thought that since she died and she was my biggest supporter, it was time for me to quit the FBI and find something he referred to as \u2018more respectable\u2019 to do for a living. What is it with him? He doesn\u2019t have to be proud of me but how can he be so hard on me? I can\u2019t really be that inadequate. I get the job done. I don\u2019t get any complaints from the FBI.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he ever suggest he could take you? Ask you to break free of his hold? Because that could have been interesting....\u201d</p><p>A little puff of laughter escaped her. \u201cHe\u2019s seventy. A very tough, strong seventy, but I wouldn\u2019t throw him. Things are bad enough between us.\u201d</p><p>Eric got up and went behind her. \u201cScoot,\u201d he said, pushing her forward a little bit. \u201cLet me back here.\u201d He stepped over the back of the chaise so that he was behind her, his long legs on either side of the chaise. He pulled her back against him. Once she was settled there, he put his hands in her hair, his fingertips gently massaging her scalp.</p><p>\u201cOhhhh... Whatever that is you\u2019re doing, it\u2019s okay to keep doing it....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I get worried about my parents or frustrated with them, it gives me a headache. And I\u2019m not a headache kind of guy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo they get you upset regularly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Very regularly. My mom is a very negative person anyway and she really has an excuse in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what do you do?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI apologize for getting in so much trouble as a kid, for embarrassing the whole family, promise I\u2019m doing better now, all the same stuff. Over and over. And I try to be patient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who rubs your head?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He laughed softly. \u201cI take aspirin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think I should do?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, my first reaction would be to remember your dad might be too old to change his habits. Maybe he\u2019s just one of those negative people.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI just couldn\u2019t ever impress him. Period. He\u2019s always been that kind of guy who knows it all, though. He knows what\u2019s best for everyone, what\u2019s right for the whole world. He\u2019s arrogant. Omnipotent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about your brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like he picks at Pax as much, but then Pax studied medicine, which was what Senior had in mind for both of us. And also, Pax just ignores him. He never argues with him, just lets him rant on. It\u2019s true, if he doesn\u2019t get an argument, he runs out of steam pretty quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you thought about doing that? Just let him have his say, however unfair or unkind it is, and put up with it? Because he\u2019s your father and you\u2019re stuck with him?\u201d</p><p>She leaned back against him. \u201cMy mother used to say I was as stubborn as he is. And that I have a real problem with needing to be right. I don\u2019t want to be like him, needing to be right all the time. It\u2019s awful. You\u2019re not like that.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward and kissed her neck. \u201cLaine, you have to remember, I\u2019m the cause of my parents\u2019 unhappiness. I didn\u2019t just shoplift a candy bar and take it back to the store. I was convicted of armed robbery.\u201d</p><p>She turned to look over her shoulder at him. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t have a weapon and you didn\u2019t rob anyone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was there. That was enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know you got screwed, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI looked at the record and the transcripts. You had an inadequate defense and a hanging judge....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou looked,\u201d he said with a shallow laugh. \u201cHow does that not surprise me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOccupational hazard....\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I have no secrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I could find....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you don\u2019t care, but I didn\u2019t run a background check on you.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled. \u201cI\u2019d love to see you try.\u201d She glanced over her shoulder. \u201cWhat should I do about my dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Laine. It must hurt so much. Instinct says, he\u2019s your dad. Do your best to get along, you won\u2019t have him forever. And you can fix your own boundaries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich I have. I moved to the other coast and changed my number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty serious boundaries,\u201d he said. \u201cThat explains why my call to you didn\u2019t go through a couple of hours ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. I was caught up in what I\u2019d done. I can usually make very dramatic moves without getting emotional, but this time... Well, I\u2019ve been threatening to just disengage from Senior since our relationship is at least fifty percent misery. But I kept hoping....\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstandable,\u201d Eric went on. \u201cIf I were your best friend and you were dating a guy who treated you like he owned you, I\u2019d tell you to break away. Fast. Because you just don\u2019t treat a person you love like that. It\u2019s not good. It won\u2019t work. For either of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you are my best friend,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think my father has ever loved me. If he loved me, wouldn\u2019t he be nicer to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPax is your best friend,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my twin. It\u2019s a whole different thing. But you? You\u2019re a friend. And you\u2019re wonderful with scalp massage.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cAs for your dad, who knows what makes him tick. If you\u2019ve told him how he makes you feel and nothing changes, maybe he just doesn\u2019t get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you move in with me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He stopped massaging.</p><p>\u201cI scared you, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>He put his hands on her shoulders. \u201cTurn around for me, Laine.\u201d She moved around so she was facing him and crossed her legs. \u201cYou\u2019ve never lived with anyone, have you?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cHave you lived with a lot of people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust Cara. Look, I know what I told you about that, that it had run its course and we knew it. But I didn\u2019t go into it thinking it had an expiration date on it. I thought our relationship would get stronger. I knew there would be adjustments to sharing space, but I thought once we figured it out, it would be easy. It wasn\u2019t easy. And it didn\u2019t get stronger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think we\u2019d get stronger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what\u2019s left of your leave from the FBI? Before you go back to the East Coast and get back to doing work you can\u2019t talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. You want to see some long-term potential before you even share a closet? Even though we sleep together every night and you have a key and your own toothbrush?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if this will make any sense, Laine, but here goes.... If you told me right now that you\u2019re done here, that you\u2019re leaving next week to go back to that life you left behind, that would really bite. I\u2019m not done with you, not by a long shot. It would be hard, but it wouldn\u2019t be a shock. I could still grab my toothbrush, the spare jeans, extra jacket, garage uniform, leave my key on the kitchen counter and go back to my place. Not much of a place, but I can live with it. But the idea of living with you for a year, getting deeper and deeper into you and then suddenly\u2014bam\u2014there\u2019s nothing. That just feels bigger than what I\u2019m up to. I can\u2019t explain it any better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re scared,\u201d she said.</p><p>He gave a nod. \u201cScared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you scared with Cara?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNot at all. Not scared, not worried, not much in love. Comfortable and relaxed with her, sure. We worked well together. But I never once thought, if she leaves me I\u2019ll crash.\u201d</p><p>That actually made her smile. \u201cYou\u2019re in love with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what it is? I wouldn\u2019t know. All I know is I haven\u2019t been in this place before. It\u2019s brand-new. It\u2019s terrifying. Why couldn\u2019t I feel this way about someone simpler? Easier to understand? Someone I have something in common with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019m a big risk. I like that. I\u2019d like to take the chance. You\u2019ll do what you think is best, but I\u2019d love to live with you. I\u2019ve never done it before, but I think I could do it with you. Or you can keep that hotel room. But gee, I hope you don\u2019t stop spending the night....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI probably couldn\u2019t if I tried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy about that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo here\u2019s the deal. You know that judge you called the hanging judge? He was the best judge there ever was. I\u2019ll never forget what he said when he sentenced me. He said, \u2018Son, you probably feel completely ruined and lost, but you\u2019re really the luckiest man I know. You\u2019re stripped down to nothing. You\u2019ve got nothing but another chance. It\u2019s going to go one of two ways. You\u2019re either going to sink even lower, find ways to make your life harder and meaner. Or you\u2019re going to use this time to turn it around, build the kind of life you can be proud of. It\u2019s all on you. Let\u2019s see what you\u2019ve got.\u2019\u201d He ran a knuckle along her cheek. \u201cI remember the day he sentenced me\u2014May 19. I send him a thank-you note every year on that day.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head, wondering what this had to do with her. With them.</p><p>\u201cI need you,\u201d he said. \u201cThe way I see it, we have months ahead to find out if what we have is really special or if it\u2019s just temporary. Nobody ever won a race by standing at the starting line. Let\u2019s see what we\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cLet\u2019s see.\u201d</p><p>Nine</p><p>Eric didn\u2019t pack all his things and move in with Laine. He kept his motel room but slowly, so slowly, transferred personal items to her house. His laundered work clothes, hanging so politely in the dry cleaning bags, went directly to Laine\u2019s closet rather than back to the motel and he carried a small duffel back and forth, dropping off clothes. He caught her moving some of his things around between drawers and refolding them. She held up an article of clothing\u2014plaid flannel pants. \u201cWhat are these?\u201d she asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cPajamas,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHmm. What an absurd idea.\u201d</p> <p>He laughed at her and thought to himself, if a man is going to move in with a woman as sexy and tempting as Laine Carrington, it\u2019s damn lucky she likes sex. More than that, she fell into cohabitation seamlessly. His days were long and he was up early, yet she would slip into the shower with him and shave his face. \u201cYou\u2019d think a mechanic would be more scruffy and less meticulous,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWould you like me scruffier?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like you to sleep a little later, but I understand you can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>And yet he\u2019d never felt more rested.</p><p>Domesticity appealed to him. He realized that maybe he had moved in with Cara searching for something along these lines. Living with Laine was entirely different\u2014there was a routine, for one thing. Intimacy, for another; intimacy that wasn\u2019t limited to sex. Sometimes they cooked together; sometimes it was his turn or she\u2019d cooked earlier in the day. Sometimes they went out or if they\u2019d each had long days, he brought something home. On those evenings when he didn\u2019t have to be at the garage, when they read or watched TV, she slowly moved into his space until she was cuddled up to him, soft in his arms, her hair tickling his chin. She brought home another chaise for the deck and on rare sunny days, they walked across the beach to Cooper\u2019s. She rubbed his feet and he massaged her shoulders after a karate session at the dojo she\u2019d joined. They found a division of chores that came naturally. He usually did the dishes, they shared the laundry and he pushed the vacuum around because her arm was still weak and sometimes sore. They were always cleaning the bathroom or kitchen\u2014they were equally fussy about those rooms. The one place she wanted autonomy was when she got a rainy-day cooking urge. If he got in her way, she shooed him out of the kitchen. She could be so focused. She allowed him to sit on a bar stool across from her work area. And though he watched her closely, she didn\u2019t seem to even notice he was there. All these simple acts brought him amazing comfort.</p> <p>While he was slow to make that transition from his motel to her house, one day he overheard her say something that stroked his male pride very nicely. At the diner Gina asked Laine, \u201cAnd when your leave is over and you have to go back to work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t even think about it.\u201d</p><p>Things were good, so good.</p><p>Eric didn\u2019t necessarily want to put less energy into the service station, but he had been in touch with a couple of his best employees from Eugene to see if there was any interest in relocating to Thunder Point. So far he\u2019d had no success. And then, in the middle of March when the buds were just forming on the plants and trees, when the sun came out more often than it hid, when he\u2019d been a kept man for just a month, a truck pulled up to the station and parked outside the garage doors.</p><p>Eric wiped his hands on a rag and went outside to see what the customer needed, but as the man stepped out of the cab, Eric\u2019s face split in a huge grin when he recognized Al Michel. He walked toward him and grabbed his hand in a firm grip. \u201cAl,\u201d he said. They pulled together, shoulder to shoulder. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Al shrugged. \u201cJust thought I\u2019d check out your new setup,\u201d he said. Then he looked around, sizing up the front of the station. \u201cLucky\u2019s, is it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou have no idea.\u201d Eric laughed. \u201cLooking for work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could do some, yeah. Unless you\u2019re full up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. In fact, I\u2019m looking for help but the last time I called Eugene, no one knew where you\u2019d gone.\u201d</p><p>Al shook his head. \u201cThe new owner, he has some policies that didn\u2019t sit well with me. He brought in some of his own people, lowered some wages\u2014 And he\u2019s not interested in hiring any gypsies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLowered pay? He wasn\u2019t supposed to do that,\u201d Eric said, frowning.</p><p>\u201cSeems like he forgot what he promised you. You might wanna give Rafael a call, ask him how he\u2019s getting along. That man\u2019s got a flock of kids and you know kids,\u201d he said, rubbing a hand along the back of his neck. \u201cThey\u2019re so damn stubborn about eating. And they grow out of their shoes all the damn time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast time I talked to him, he was worried about the cost of a move. And his wife\u2019s family is in Eugene. I\u2019ll check in again and see if anything has changed for him. When can you start here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI travel real light. I\u2019ll go find myself a room somewhere and get right to it.\u201d He nodded at Eric. \u201cGuess you\u2019re gonna make me wear one of those fancy uniforms.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of that for you. And I\u2019ve got a place for you to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, appreciate it, Eric, but I\u2019m not real big on roommates....\u201d</p><p>Eric shook his head. \u201cNo roommates. I\u2019ve been slowly moving out of my room at the Coastline Inn. I holed up there when I got to town and didn\u2019t bother looking for anything permanent because I was busy working on updating the station and pouring a slab for a body shop. Keeping this place open seven days a week at the same time\u2014I never had time to think about moving. I bought a little refrigerator and toaster. The motel has coffee in the morning and there are plenty of places to eat around town. I still have a few things to take out of that room\u2014it\u2019s a good weekly rate. Use it as long as you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you hanging your hat these days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI moved in with a woman,\u201d he said.</p><p>Al whistled. \u201cYou move fast.\u201d</p><p>Eric chuckled. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t. I\u2019ve been with her since January and I\u2019ve been taking one shirt at a time to her house, giving her plenty of time to realize she\u2019s lost her mind. But she\u2019s crazy, I guess. I can clear the rest of my stuff out of that room in ten minutes and leave you the little appliances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t wait to meet this mentally challenged woman,\u201d Al said with a big smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give her a call...ask her what her plans are for dinner. If she\u2019s busy, I\u2019ll take you to the restaurant at the marina.\u201d Eric couldn\u2019t stop grinning. \u201cDamn, I\u2019m glad to see you, Al. I\u2019m not real well fixed here. Got two old boys who pumped gas here before I bought the place, Manny came with me and there\u2019s Justin\u2014seventeen and full of attitude.\u201d</p><p>Al smirked. \u201cSounds like hats and horns all day long.\u201d</p><p>Eric was thinking, No way you can make me not love my life right now. \u201cI\u2019ll take you over to the motel. Let you settle in. If you have too much stuff, there\u2019s storage space in the garage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never carry more than I can lift, Eric.\u201d</p><p>Eric cocked his head. \u201cYou ever put down any roots? Even for a little while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat constitutes roots? I had a few years here, a few there. I wasn\u2019t too impressed with roots. Any of our old customers head this way with the classics?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few. I haven\u2019t been looking for them or advertising yet. I\u2019ve been busy just running the station and the wrench end of things. I guess it\u2019s about time for me to get on that. Let me get Manny. He\u2019s going to want to say hello. Then I\u2019ll take you over to the Coastline Inn.\u201d</p><p>Eric walked into Laine\u2019s house at five-thirty, early for him. He was met with delicious smells and the sound of faint music coming from upstairs. In the kitchen he found a pot simmering. He lifted the lid and just inhaled greedily\u2014his favorite meal, steak soup. Then he climbed the stairs.</p><p>Laine was humming to the music; she had her iPod attached to the speakers in the bathroom. There was also the sound of water sloshing around. Eric sat on the bed and took off his boots, smiling to himself. Then on a whim, he took off his shirt and pants.</p><p>The soaker tub was large enough for two, but he didn\u2019t want to presume too much so he wrapped a towel around his naked body and made a little noise in the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cEric?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d he said. He moved into the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re early,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAnd so happy to be early.\u201d He dropped the towel and stepped into the tub with her. \u201cCome on, make some room here.\u201d</p><p>She pulled up her knees for him. \u201cWhy are you early?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you making steak soup? The sun is shining. You never make big soups or stews when the sun is shining.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had an overwhelming day. Nothing I can\u2019t handle, but Jesus, does everyone have skeletons in their closets? I was looking for one of my deadbeat dads for the sheriff\u2019s department. He was supposed to have left the state and I found him right in North Bend. Working in a garage that, unless I don\u2019t know anything, is a chop shop!\u201d She sighed. \u201cNow it\u2019s going over to auto theft. The police thought they were just dealing with unpaid child support and alimony but when they lock this guy up, he\u2019s never going to pay a dime to his family. I wanted to slug him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you arrest him?\u201d Eric asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I told him he\u2019d won the lottery and asked for his address so I can send him the check. He\u2019s so stupid, he doesn\u2019t have a clue I figured out what was going on in that garage. Why\u2019d it have to be a garage? You have a garage!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that kind of garage. How\u2019d you find him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was too easy. He has a shiny new credit card and he likes to pay his cell phone bill with it. And a few other things like sexy lingerie, clubs, booze. No car insurance, rent or doctor\u2019s bills, but his cell phone bill goes to an address for some woman\u2019s apartment. His last known address was in California and he\u2019s used a bunch of different names, but he always pays the cell phone bill. He\u2019s very attached to his phone. And of course the imbecile is on Facebook.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cHe probably has some very valuable pictures on his phone. I\u2019ll bet he does Facebook from the phone. And he has to use his real name so all his buds and girls know it\u2019s him. The dumb-ass.\u201d</p><p>Eric frowned. \u201cWait a minute here. You found him from a cell phone number? And Facebook? How\u2019d you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sent him an email,\u201d she said with a shrug. \u201cAsked him if he was the John Doe who entered a lottery contest in California three years ago at that last known address and promised to send a representative to his place of employment with the paperwork so he could collect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaperwork?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI created a form. Easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he bought that? That you were from the lottery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t ask for ID.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what if he\u2019d figured you out? What if he realized he was being tricked?\u201d Eric asked.</p><p>\u201cThat would have been totally awkward....\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr dangerous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. I wasn\u2019t confrontational. I would\u2019ve gone away quietly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know? About the chop shop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could smell it. They weren\u2019t open for business. No sign, no opened garage doors, nothing\u2014yet they were full of late model vehicles in varying states of dismantling. Not a big chop shop\u2014a nice small one. So I interviewed him a little\u2014that lottery prize was going to come in handy. I mentioned to him I knew pay on a mechanic\u2019s salary could be tight especially with a family, et cetera. Did he want the prize money deposited or mailed to him by special courier? And the idiot asked if he could get the prize in cash because car thieves live on cash. But don\u2019t worry, Eric. I was vigilant. Cautious. And armed.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet. Then he smiled and touched that little dimple in her cheek. \u201cI\u2019m so glad I\u2019m not running from the law....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wanted a deadbeat dad. I didn\u2019t want all that felony drama. This is supposed to be part-time!\u201d</p><p>\u201cScary...\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond. Then she said, \u201cAre you in the mood for steak soup? You love steak soup.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cI have a new employee. A former employee, actually. He\u2019s worked for me on and off since I got into this business. He showed up out of the blue, which he usually does, but today it was just when I was really needing someone like him. His name is Al Michel\u2014damn fine mechanic. I told him I\u2019d see if you have plans and if you\u2019re busy\u2014like with steak soup or something else\u2014I can take him to Cliffhanger\u2019s for dinner. Oh, and I gave him my motel room.\u201d</p><p>She grinned at that. \u201cSo. You\u2019re finally ready to commit?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve committed to bringing the last of my clothes. Come here,\u201d he said. \u201cCome closer. I want to feel your naked slippery body up against me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not having sex in the tub.\u201d She laughed. \u201cI was relaxing. I\u2019m okay with you asking Al over for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to go get one more bread bowl from Cliff\u2014I stopped and got two. And you can\u2019t let him stay too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the bread bowl. I\u2019ll get rid of him early. But you\u2019ll like him. He\u2019s one of those easy, laid-back wrenches. He\u2019ll be good to have around the garage. He\u2019s an uncomplicated guy\u2014kind of sticks to himself, but he\u2019s not unfriendly at all. You\u2019ll see. Just a good old Midwestern farm boy.\u201d</p> <p>Al wasn\u2019t old or young, Laine realized immediately. He looked to be in his fifties with a toned body and full head of brown hair threaded with gray. He was very pleasant, had an easy smile, a sense of humor, made eye contact and yet didn\u2019t have a lot to say. He came from a small farm town\u2014Boone, Iowa\u2014but left there as a young man. Growing up, they called him Mick, short for Michel. He\u2019d been married once, when he was a very young man, and he must not have been very good at it because his young wife invited him to depart. He\u2019d been single since. He had worked in many different areas\u2014construction, mechanics, the occasional factory, drove a semitruck and did farm work as a fallback. He lived cheap and traveled when he could. He had one sister who was busy saving the human race, one third-world country at a time. She worked for a Christian charity and moved around the world. She was single, as he was, and there was no more family in Iowa, but he still went back there about once a year, just to check in with his hometown.</p><p>Then he left to go back to the hotel, thanking her for the great soup. Eric walked him to his truck, then came back to Laine.</p><p>\u201cHe said to thank you again,\u201d Eric said. \u201cAnd he asked if you were a cop.\u201d</p><p>That sent up red flags. \u201cOhhh, he might be hiding something if he caught on to my questions. I\u2019m sorry, I tried not to do that, it\u2019s just so automatic!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told him you were a psychologist.\u201d Eric laughed. \u201cAnd he\u2019s not hiding anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe was one of my first employees in Eugene and my parole office had to approve every one. Al is exactly what he appears to be\u2014a good old farm boy who travels, takes jobs when he needs to, moves around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWomen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen him with a woman or two,\u201d Eric said. \u201cThat\u2019s all I know. That\u2019s all I want to know. Seriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really like him,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s always looking out for me. He was working for me when I found out about Ashley\u2014he thought that was very cool, that I was getting a second chance. I didn\u2019t know he\u2019d been married once. Men don\u2019t ask those kind of questions, in case you haven\u2019t figured that out. I asked him all the places he\u2019d worked and lived and he got a very big kick out of it since I was an ex-con kid and he\u2019s fifteen or twenty years older and hasn\u2019t been in any trouble. That I know of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it strange? The way he just ambles around, picking up jobs here and there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Eric said. \u201cNot in a business like mine. It\u2019s good work. Requires skill. And if he was a problem around the shop, I wouldn\u2019t welcome him back. All right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you keep an eye on things,\u201d she advised.</p> <p>He pulled her against him. \u201cLaine, it\u2019s my store. I keep an eye on everything, everyone. Even you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d she said, stiffening. \u201cWell, that\u2019s good, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s good comes next. Let\u2019s see how fast I can do the dishes and get you into bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll help with the dishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on the insatiable side,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true, yet another thing I didn\u2019t know about myself. Coming home to you is still the best part of my day even if you only barely took your last personal item out of your backup motel room.\u201d</p><p>Al Michel\u2019s life wasn\u2019t as uncomplicated as he let on, though he worked hard at making it appear so. He\u2019d had troubles just like anyone else. Like Eric, who had that old wild-youth thing to live with. It didn\u2019t take him long to get the lay of the land. And, as he got to know some of the folks in town, it was as he expected\u2014there were other folks who looked as though they were holding life together real well, when in fact they had their own issues. That Cooper, very nice guy, found out he had a son by an old girlfriend just a year or so ago. Gina and Mac, they\u2019d gone through a lot before getting to a place where they could combine families and enjoy a peaceful existence\u2014as peaceful as a house full of teenagers would allow. The young town doctor\u2014he\u2019d lost his wife with the birth of his second child. And Devon? Pretty, young Devon\u2014she\u2019d gotten herself involved in some cult. Of course as a rule folks didn\u2019t tell a newcomer like Al their life stories\u2014they told other people\u2019s stories. Whether it was at the pump, in the diner, out at the beach bar, it didn\u2019t matter. All he had to do was answer the question \u201cWho have you met so far?\u201d and the next tale had something to do with one of his new acquaintances.</p><p>There was a cute little real estate agent who liked to have a glass of wine at Cliffhanger\u2019s bar. Apparently she didn\u2019t have much of a story except that her clothes were too sexy and she was a flirt, two qualities that Al found completely desirable. Her name was Ray Anne and she made him laugh so two Friday nights in a row he financed her wine. Then while he was at work, he heard the little ping that announced a customer at the pump and he looked out the window to see her BMW. \u201cI\u2019ve got this one,\u201d he told Justin.</p><p>\u201cShe must sure do a lot of driving. Isn\u2019t that her fourth time here this week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight be,\u201d Al said. \u201cI\u2019m not keeping track. Are you?\u201d</p><p>Justin laughed and shook his head. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so are you.\u201d</p><p>He was, in fact. He enjoyed Ray Anne\u2019s company and looked forward to every encounter.</p><p>In no time at all he could tell he was well-liked in town. Probably because he was a real friendly sort. He\u2019d look over the menu at the diner and ask Gina, \u201cWhat\u2019s good today?\u201d And she\u2019d tell him exactly what to order. He was never unhappy and always left a generous tip. The same applied at the deli and again at Cooper\u2019s place on the beach. All his change went into a big jar that he would soon begin taking to the local bank every month to have added to his new account. It was so simple and tidy.</p><p>He found there was much about Thunder Point to suit him. That ordinary little motel room worked just fine. He tended to like boarding houses. He only had to be concerned about himself and one room yet there was a sense of family, even if it was usually a haphazardly thrown together and odd family, but no attachment required. Boarding houses were almost a thing of the past and pretty hard to find. He thought the demise of the boarding house was a great loss to society.</p><p>This town, with its clinic, diner, beach bar, deli and garage, it was like a big boarding house. He got used to seeing the same people over and over and before very long they were not just cordial, but connected, making him feel like a new friend. And that was really all Al was looking for.</p><p>Al had known Manny for a long time. Manny had been with Eric for a good eight years and helped to manage a lot of the business. He was good under the hood and with restoration and body repair\u2014he could really do it all. Al was good at engines and priceless at keeping things spotless. And Manny liked paperwork, which Al hated.</p><p>He\u2019d been in Thunder Point and back in Eric\u2019s shop for a few weeks when Eric said, \u201cI\u2019m putting Justin with you. He wants to learn a few things about engine repair and I figured when things are running a little slow at night, maybe you can show him a thing or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want,\u201d Al said.</p><p>\u201cTry to soften him up a little, will you? He\u2019s prickly as a cactus. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because he\u2019s seventeen or if he has other problems. I\u2019d like the kid to have a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think he doesn\u2019t have a chance?\u201d Al asked.</p><p>Eric shook his head. \u201cHe reminds me of me. Except Justin hasn\u2019t figured out cool yet. I had too much cool for my own good. This kid, he just doesn\u2019t add up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pay attention,\u201d Al said. \u201cI\u2019ll ask him if he wants me to show him a few things.\u201d But, he thought, most of us probably don\u2019t add up.</p><p>Ten</p><p>April brought yet more sunshine to Thunder Point and Laine felt her life was more stable than it had been in too long.</p><p>She was enjoying working as a consultant for the sheriff\u2019s department, researching their investigations to advise on driving their prosecution to the federal level. She was also doing the odd job for the Bureau. The sheriff\u2019s department work was more satisfying than consulting for the Bureau, but it occurred to her that she could make a painless career doing background checks for schools, industry, law enforcement, et cetera. The problem for Laine was that she kept tripping over infractions. Serious and felonious breaches. A routine check for admission to the police department turned up a felon who failed to disclose his long and rather colorful record; a teacher application to a public school showed a history of sex crimes in another state. She was like a bloodhound\u2014she could smell it. Her instincts had become razor-sharp. She knew she was useful in this new capacity and that worked for her for now.</p><p>She was also getting back in shape. The dojo she had joined was an excellent workout facility and she had a private instructor and well-known acupuncturist\u2014her shoulder and elbow hardly bothered her these days. The town of Thunder Point was her new playground; she had friends and fun\u2014two things that had never registered high on her list of priorities. And she had Eric, the kind of wonderful, smart, passionate man she never expected to have in her life.</p><p>But she hadn\u2019t seen Pax or his family since Christmas. Missy was getting ready for her spring concert. Sissy was practicing for a dance recital. She had the time and the money to get home to check in with them, feel the hugs of the little girls and experience that odd connection with Pax that only twins had. They\u2019d often talked about it, the way they knew when they needed each other, and speculated on how logical it was for identical twins and how illogical for fraternal, who were mere siblings. And yet...</p><p>\u201cWhat about Senior?\u201d Pax asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather skip that, if you don\u2019t mind. Unless he insists on being present for the concert or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll mention to Genevieve that you\u2019re still avoiding him. I\u2019ll ask her not to call him. The truth is, I haven\u2019t seen much of him lately. I talk to him every week, just long enough for each of us to say we\u2019re fine and nothing is new. And our schedules are... You know how they are. I think it\u2019s very unlikely he\u2019d make a surprise visit while you\u2019re here. In fact, if I were an investigator, I\u2019d suspect him of laying low since that row at Christmas. He offended everyone, not just you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI drew a line in the sand,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t communicate again until he apologizes and stops ridiculing me. He went too far.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cHe did,\u201d Pax agreed. \u201cAnd if by some wildly unlikely coincidence he shows up over here or we run into him, we\u2019re all going to be grown-ups and no blowups. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she agreed. \u201cI never meant for this to hurt you. I can live with whatever you want. If you want us to have a little family party, a reunion, I can go with that. But I\u2019m not giving him my new phone number.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t wrong. He was out of line. But listen, all I want is to be a good brother, a good husband, a decent father to my girls. And I know you don\u2019t think Genevieve is quite good enough for me, but she is my wingman.\u201d</p><p>In spite of herself, Laine actually sucked in a breath. He was so devoted to Genevieve. But she was supposed to be his wingman!</p><p>\u201cMy other wingman,\u201d he said patiently. \u201cI rely on my wife to not only support this fellowship, this career choice that keeps me awake at night and gone on weekends and birthdays, but I\u2019m counting on her to let me know when my girls need their father. And she\u2019s made it clear\u2014if I start to show signs of being the kind of father Senior is, with unreasonable expectations of our girls, I\u2019m in serious trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI give her a lot of credit for that,\u201d Laine said. Laine had always felt their mother was too patient with Senior, excusing his impossible-to-please attitude toward Laine. Janice had occasionally said, \u201cShut up, Paxton!\u201d But not often enough.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there Wednesday,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m only staying two days. Please let me have a sleepover with the girls. I\u2019ll be unbearably nice to Genevieve.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll stay with us, as usual,\u201d he said. \u201cNo tattoos for the girls.\u201d</p><p>Then she broke it to Eric. \u201cI miss them so much,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m okay being away from them when I\u2019m deep in some case, but when I was working four or five days a week I just couldn\u2019t stand it if I couldn\u2019t be with them on my days off. If it wasn\u2019t such short notice, I\u2019d ask you to come along. Next time, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your dad?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou going to talk to him? Make up with him?\u201d</p><p>She turned away from him.</p><p>He turned her back. \u201cLevel with me. What would your mother think of this situation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother always said we were too much alike, equally stubborn and pigheaded\u2014two people who had to be right. And when I lost my mother, I lost the buffer between us. I told you that when I was visiting Pax over the holidays, my father was even more cruel than I can remember. God,\u201d she said, looking down. \u201cIt embarrasses me to even tell you this....\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can tell me anything,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI told him I\u2019d been recommended for a service award, for saving lives.\u201d Tears gathered in her eyes. \u201cHe said I\u2019d lost my mind and deserved an award for being the biggest idiot. That only a fool would take the risks I took routinely and if I wanted to save lives, there were more logical, safer and profitable ways.\u201d She took a breath. \u201cMy arm was still in a sling, I was feeling pretty weak and vulnerable and not too sure of myself. Then he said if I expected him to celebrate the fact that I\u2019d stopped a bullet I was dreaming. Didn\u2019t I know doctors saved lives every day without putting themselves in mortal danger? And I lost it. I told him he was a self-centered bastard and I was finished with his criticism and his disrespectful treatment. He said I was the disrespectful one and he was bloody tired of my bragging and wearing my close calls like a badge of honor. There was a lot of arguing that evolved into yelling. It was horrible.\u201d</p><p>There was a long moment of silence before Eric said, \u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt disrupted the whole family. Pax was furious with him and worried about me. The girls were upset and scared. Genevieve was stunned. But for me, there was just no more going on. I was recovering from an injury that nearly cost me my life and he accused me of showing off! I haven\u2019t spoken to him since. He\u2019s a popular doctor, pretty well-liked as doctors go even if he can be a narcissistic dick sometimes.... But the way he talks to me? It\u2019s terrible. And it hurts. It just...hurts.\u201d</p><p>Eric was speechless. Finally he asked, \u201cAnd your mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA goddess. One of the kindest, most generous women I\u2019ve ever known. She was completely supportive. She hated that he wasn\u2019t and most of the time she could shut him up before he said something really awful. She always said that Pax had more of her temperament, a much gentler nature, and I had more of my father\u2019s. She said my father could have made a good operative\u2014he\u2019s fearless and stubborn and there\u2019s no one more determined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she put up with that from your father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey loved each other. He didn\u2019t give her any shit and she could put him in his place with one word. But then she died and he was on the loose. There was no one to keep him in line.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe must not know how much this hurts you,\u201d Eric said.</p><p>\u201cOh, I think he knows,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd he thinks his opinions are more important than my feelings. So I\u2019m done. Unless he can change his attitude, I don\u2019t need him in my life. The problem is\u2014I\u2019m thirty-three, I\u2019ve been putting up with this my whole life, and it can still break my heart.\u201d</p><p>Eric pulled her into his arms and held her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, baby. I wish I knew of a solution....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the solution,\u201d she said. \u201cI have to let it go. Let him go. And carry on. I miss my mother every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she\u2019s not all that far away,\u201d he said, brushing her hair away from her face. \u201cI\u2019ve had your dumplings, remember.\u201d</p><p>She smiled back at him. \u201cBoy, have you ever.\u201d</p><p>Laine remembered when her mother had said, \u201cDo what makes your heart beat.\u201d She said that right until she died. But she had also said, \u201cYou don\u2019t need approval and you don\u2019t need an excuse or explanation for living your own life. Remember that.\u201d</p><p>Oh, she remembered. But it was easy for her mother, who had the approval of her parents and her husband and her children. Easy for Pax, who had done as he was expected to do. Laine was the only one who had really defied custom, gone her own way, quite successfully, and yet was considered by her father to be a failure.</p><p>She had Eric\u2019s support and even though they were still new, that meant so much to her. She was so anxious to have Pax get to know him. In fact, Eric and Pax were a lot alike, when she thought about it.</p><p>She flew to San Francisco and took the red-eye into Boston. She had given Pax the flight details and said she would be waiting at his house when the girls came home from school and when he was done at the hospital. But when she deplaned at 8:30 a.m. there were two little blonde bombshells standing on the curb near the taxi line, jumping up and down, yelling at her. \u201cAuntie Lainie! Auntie Lainie!\u201d</p><p>It took her a moment to catch her breath. She put her hand to her chest and gasped in sheer, tear-gathering delight. She opened her arms to them and they rushed her, nearly knocking her over. \u201cMy babes, my angels! Are you angels? You promised you would be angels!\u201d</p><p>They giggled and said, one at a time, \u201cYou said to be devils!\u201d and \u201cWe were very bad, like you said!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, thank goodness! I\u2019m proud of you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we have blue polish for our toes,\u201d Missy said.</p><p>\u201cAnd I have silver,\u201d Sissy said.</p><p>\u201cBut you have school!\u201d</p><p>There was a fit of fake coughing. \u201cWe\u2019re very sick!\u201d Sissy said.</p><p>\u201cI can see that, poor devils!\u201d</p><p>Laine stood up and looked into the kind blue eyes of the sister-in-law she made work so hard for her affection. \u201cI told Pax I\u2019d grab a cab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t have that,\u201d Genevieve said.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you kept them home from school. You never do that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou only have two days,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to waste a second of it. The girls are so thrilled. You guys really have to use Skype more often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know to wait by the cab line?\u201d Laine asked.</p><p>Genevieve just laughed. \u201cYou? Check a bag? For a couple of days? Laine, you\u2019d take carry-on to Europe!\u201d</p><p>Well, true enough, she thought. \u201cBreakfast?\u201d Laine asked.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you want. Did you sleep on the plane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can sleep anywhere,\u201d she lied. It used to be true.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could,\u201d Genevieve said. \u201cLet\u2019s get breakfast, then you can play.\u201d</p><p>Play? It wasn\u2019t exactly play as it completely wore Laine out, but it was fun. They started off with rehearsing\u2014Missy on her cello and Sissy wearing her tutu and dancing around the family room. Before long Missy and Laine wore makeshift tutus and were learning dance steps from Sissy. Then it was time to do art in the kitchen\u2014clay and paints. Then lunch, then makeovers\u2014fingers and toes, mani-pedis. Baths and hair curling. Then off to a dress rehearsal for Sissy\u2019s dance recital at four; Laine couldn\u2019t miss it as she would miss the actual performance a week later. Then home for pizza and the elementary school strings concert at seven. Of course Genevieve\u2019s two sisters and her parents were also there. Pax showed up at the last minute, wearing scrubs, of course. He had barely escaped the hospital and was on his way back the second it was over.</p><p>\u201cHow do you stand it?\u201d Laine asked Genevieve.</p><p>\u201cThe concert? Or the doctor\u2019s hours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, since you mentioned it\u2014either one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve learned not to hear too much of the music. It reminds me a lot of slaughter day at the farm. As for the hours, I think about what baby or little kid he might be operating on\u2014that gets me past the jealousy. I complain, though. I don\u2019t want to, I don\u2019t mean to, but I complain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou probably get lonely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLonely for adult company, even though the girls fill up the days and nights. We try to schedule time together,\u201d she whispered. \u201cBut the doctor he works for is such a nasty dick and I think he enjoys messing up our little bit of family time!\u201d</p><p>Laine chuckled behind her hand and whispered back, \u201cI\u2019ve never heard you use that word before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPax has never worked for such a dick before. Really, he\u2019s impossible. He owns my husband. And he doesn\u2019t deserve him.\u201d</p><p>After the concert came ice cream, after ice cream it was pajamas and then it was back rubs with lotion. The girls would sleep in the guest room\u2019s big king-size bed with Laine. It had been such a big day, they were both asleep in minutes.</p><p>Laine stumbled into the family room, where she heard the TV volume turned low. Her sister-in-law sat on the sofa, her feet propped up on an ottoman, a bottle of wine open and breathing on a tray that also held two glasses.</p><p>\u201cOh, my goodness,\u201d Laine said happily. \u201cHow did you know I wouldn\u2019t be passed out in the bed between two little blondes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it was when you tried to order Cabernet ice cream at Baskin-Robbins,\u201d she said, lifting the bottle. \u201cPlus, you\u2019re on West Coast time\u2014you should be rockin\u2019 until midnight, at least. But, I was prepared to drink alone if necessary. I got a text from Pax that he should be home in an hour, which usually means three. But I like to wait up if I can.\u201d</p><p>Laine slumped in the corner of the sectional beside Genevieve. \u201cI think that ice-cream guy was a little rude to me. He couldn\u2019t take a joke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were joking?\u201d Genevieve poured two glasses, handed one to Laine and toasted her. \u201cWelcome home,\u201d she said.</p><p>Laine took a sip and then was stilled for a moment. \u201cThis has been my home. This house more than the house I grew up in, at least since my mom died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you when we got engaged\u2014our home is always your home. It always will be. I know giving him up to me was hard for you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>Laine shrugged. \u201cDon\u2019t make me out to be too possessive. I knew I\u2019d have to give him up to a wife eventually. I just didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d decide to get married when he was twelve.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve laughed at her. \u201cWe were pretty young. I could have waited a couple of years, but Pax\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFell hard,\u201d Laine interjected. \u201cHard and fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s always like that\u2014when he decides he wants something, he\u2019s single-minded. A lot like his twin. How\u2019s the arm, Lainie?\u201d</p><p>She flexed and straightened it as if on demand. \u201cBetter. I haven\u2019t been able to do a push-up yet, but I\u2019ve been working out in a dojo and getting some acupuncture. I think if the girls didn\u2019t wreck me today, I\u2019m in pretty good shape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look wonderful,\u201d Genevieve said. \u201cSomething in the water out there on the coast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She laughed. \u201cFish. The sun just made its debut a couple of weeks ago. Did Pax tell you? I\u2019m doing a little part-time investigative work for the sheriff\u2019s department. And the Bureau has sent me a little work\u2014nothing big, but enough to keep me busy so I\u2019m not sitting around, just waiting for something to happen. As it turns out, I\u2019m not really crazy about time off.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou never have been, but then you\u2019ve never been shot before. And even though you and Senior have always had your issues, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen you as angry as you were at Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope I apologized for that. I shouldn\u2019t have put you and the girls through that hideous shouting match.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou apologized two or three times and each time I told you I didn\u2019t blame you for being angry. He crossed the line, suggesting a commendation for saving lives wasn\u2019t impressive or important. Sometimes I just don\u2019t know what\u2019s the matter with that man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAside from being an arrogant ass, not too much....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI encourage Pax to ignore him, but let me tell you something\u2014he won\u2019t talk to my daughters that way or he\u2019ll answer to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you had to take them out of the room because I was yelling and Senior was giving it right back to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI took them out of the room to explain that tempers were lost and that their grandfather behaved very badly to you. We\u2019re very proud of you. We\u2019re all very proud of you. Sometimes a little worried, but proud. That six months undercover somewhere that turned out to be Oregon, that was scary. The FBI is so good about checking in, letting Pax know that you were all right, but until it was over we had no idea what you might be doing or where you might be doing it. I just hope I can be as brave as your mother was\u2014I hope I can encourage my daughters to do what makes them happy.\u201d She took a sip of wine. \u201cJudging from the past week, I don\u2019t think it will be either music or dance.\u201d</p><p>Laine laughed. \u201cThat does seem kind of obvious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you knew at an early age. That\u2019s so lucky, isn\u2019t it? We all live for your visits, Laine. You have to know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve always done that, made me feel welcome when I\u2019m sure I disrupt everything. I know I\u2019m not easy,\u201d she added reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a cop. An agent,\u201d Genevieve said with a shrug. \u201cA twin. I knew what I was getting into.\u201d</p><p>Laine cocked her head and studied Genevieve. \u201cHave you changed?\u201d</p><p>Genevieve shook her head and just laughed.</p><p>\u201cAre you pregnant or something?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you kidding me? I\u2019m done with that\u2014two is enough for us. Two of our own and the thousands Pax treats and I volunteer for.\u201d</p><p>Laine burrowed back in the elbow of the plush sectional and gently swirled her wine. \u201cSomething\u2019s different about you,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to figure out what it is....\u201d</p><p>Genevieve laughed again. \u201cAuntie Lainie, it\u2019s not me. It\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? I\u2019m the same! Nothing different about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept the radiance. The shine. The calm. You\u2019ve always been very cool on the outside, but it doesn\u2019t usually feel like it goes too deep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, like I said, I\u2019ve never taken an extended leave before. And I might have a better appreciation for living. I have to keep that in perspective....\u201d</p><p>Genevieve was shaking her head. \u201cYou\u2019re in love.\u201d</p><p>Laine was shocked. \u201cBull pucky,\u201d she said. \u201cI have a guy, that\u2019s all. Not my first guy, either. Though I haven\u2019t had many good ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in love. Tell me about him. Everything. The secret things.\u201d</p><p>Laine sat straighter. \u201cOkay, you\u2019re totally different. You never swore, you never called people dicks, you never asked me about guys or secret stuff. What\u2019s going on here?\u201d</p><p>Genevieve took a breath. \u201cWe never spend time alone together. You just didn\u2019t see me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, I completely understand it. If some interloper came into my life and said she was taking my place as my sister\u2019s new best friend, I wouldn\u2019t be impressed or real accepting. I wouldn\u2019t like that person a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I treat you like that? Like you were an interloper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, of course not,\u201d Genevieve said, lifting the wine bottle and tipping it over Laine\u2019s glass. \u201cYou\u2019d never do anything to hurt Pax\u2014he\u2019s your best friend. No, you\u2019ve always been very respectful. Cordial. Tolerant.\u201d</p><p>Laine gasped.</p><p>Genevieve smiled. \u201cWallpaper,\u201d she said. \u201cI was wallpaper\u2014something in the background. You could see the color but not the pattern. Sometimes I felt more like a mother-in-law than a sister-in-law, but I knew you\u2019d come around. And see? You came around. You finally have more than one best friend!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell...\u201d</p><p>\u201cPax had you and me. Not you or me. I had my sisters. But you\u2014you had Pax. Only Pax\u2014and you were so bonded to him. Closer than just brother and sister\u2014like the other half of each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was always my mother....\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the same,\u201d Genevieve said, shaking her head. \u201cYou\u2019ve always shared your mother, since before birth. And now you\u2019re in love. Oh, you can deny it if you want to, but you\u2019re so gone it\u2019s awesome. I want to know what happened!\u201d</p><p>Laine thought for a moment and then she said, \u201cThere was this guy in town and I kept running into him. I knew he liked me\u2014eyes, body language, he was obvious. I\u2019m a trained interrogator, you now. But he was holding off. So I asked him out. And then I might\u2019ve fallen for him a little bit. Even though we have nothing in common. Nothing. Well, except maybe the way we are together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me how you are together,\u201d Genevieve asked, looking a little wild-eyed.</p><p>Laine frowned. \u201cOnly if you promise never to tell me how you and Pax are together....\u201d</p><p>Genevieve giggled and pulled the throw from the back of the sectional and covered their legs. \u201cPromise,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure it\u2019s me?\u201d Laine asked. \u201cBecause I think this is a new side of you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you,\u201d she insisted. \u201cNow hurry up and tell me the good stuff before Pax gets home and distracts us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. All right. Well, he\u2019s got the most amazing green eyes I\u2019ve ever seen. And he\u2019s strong because he works on cars, but not athletic\u2014not into the same stuff I\u2019m into. And he\u2019s very interested in my self-defense maneuvers, challenging me all the time, because he\u2019s just a guy, like Pax.... So I\u2019ve had to throw him a couple of times. Which I think he secretly likes. And then there\u2019s a whole bunch of other background stuff that makes us even more opposite....\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how does he make you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike the only woman in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Genevieve sighed. \u201cI know that feeling!\u201d</p><p>Pax walked into the house at midnight. He found his wife and sister snuggled under a throw on the couch, a couple of wineglasses on a tray on the floor. He bent over and picked up the wine bottle and tilted it. They\u2019d almost killed it.</p><p>This was something he thought he\u2019d never see\u2014his sister cozied up to his wife, asleep. They didn\u2019t actually dislike each other, but they\u2019d never really taken to each other. Until tonight?</p><p>He noticed Genevieve looking at him through barely opened eyes. She was smiling. It was a sly, secret smile. He had known for a long time that his wife admired Laine and wanted to be closer. But Laine was a pill.</p><p>Apparently while he worked late at the hospital, some sort of magic had happened between his two most beloved women.</p><p>Eleven</p><p>Al got a big kick out of Eric. He always had. That Eric\u2014he was at once serious and easygoing, a rare and welcome combination. That\u2019s why when he was looking for work, looking for a change, he\u2019d often find himself back at Eric\u2019s garage. This time, this new town suited him fine.</p><p>While Eric\u2019s girlfriend was back East visiting family she was texting Eric pictures of herself and her nieces making faces, painting their toenails blue, eating pizza or ice cream, dressed up in tutus\u2014all of them, including Laine. Eric showed Al every one. Then she returned to Thunder Point and Eric seemed to go missing. He left the station early and gave Al the keys to the tow trucks.</p><p>Al was growing fond of the little town. He now had several acquaintances, folks he saw almost daily. He liked the diner for breakfast and got to know Gina and the owner, Stu. Mac, the deputy, was a regular presence all over town. Now and then he saw Hank Cooper and he spent a little time at the beach if he wasn\u2019t at work, just to sit out on the deck at Cooper\u2019s to check out the morning or watch the sunset. And there was Cliffhanger\u2019s at the marina for a fancier meal. He figured out right off the bat that Ray Anne was a regular both there and at the diner so he began to watch for her, which wasn\u2019t hard\u2014now that she knew Al\u2019s work hours Eric had confirmed that she seemed to need a lot more gas than she had in the past. She was a consummate flirt and Al never got tired of attention from a pretty woman. He could guess she was as old as he was, possibly held together with duct tape and bailing wire just under those tight clothes, but she sure looked good for a woman of a few years. He liked looking at the girls, but he couldn\u2019t quite get interested in women who could be younger than his daughter, if he had one. Ray Anne had a mature sense of humor and it was clear she\u2019d been around the block. This was good for him, since he\u2019d probably been around a few more blocks than she had.</p><p>\u201cWhat does a man like you do on days off?\u201d she asked him when they were sitting in the diner one day.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking at it \u0327\u201d he said. \u201cNothing too exciting. Sometimes, if I have a project, like a salvaged car to work on, Eric welcomes me to use his shop. Then he expects first bid on a restored vehicle. And he\u2019s got a kid working for him\u2014Justin Russell. He has me training him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that working out?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged and said, \u201cIt\u2019s going okay. He\u2019s seventeen.\u201d</p><p>In fact, it was working out great. Al was getting attached to the kid. There was a time\u2014a very long time ago\u2014when he was a young man that he\u2019d expected to inherit his father\u2019s farm in Iowa, settle down and have a bunch of kids. While his father had been pretty harsh, Al was a patient man. Even though he had only a sister, he and his young wife thought a big farm family would suit them. Then the marriage didn\u2019t work and that idea limped into an uneasy death. But that was a long time ago and it didn\u2019t mean he had stopped appreciating the humor and challenge of kids even though he obviously wasn\u2019t meant to have any.</p><p>The more responsibility Al gave Justin, the more Justin warmed up to him. Al not only showed Justin how to service the cars and trucks, but also had him filling out the paperwork for invoices. \u201cThis brake job is four hundred, one fifty is parts, the rest labor,\u201d he\u2019d informed the teenager. \u201cThen figure the tax and I\u2019ll show you how to run the credit card because no one has cash anymore. We do a few of these together and you\u2019ll be president of the company.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cWhat company?\u201d Justin asked with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cOkay, you\u2019ll never be president, but you\u2019ll be irreplaceable. You\u2019re brilliant. You hungry?\u201d</p> <p>Justin laughed at him and began on the paperwork for the invoice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get us a pizza,\u201d Al said.</p><p>\u201cI can help with that, too,\u201d the kid said.</p><p>In the few weeks Al had been there he watched as Lucky\u2019s became a little bit of a hangout, too. Laine was there regularly, whether she\u2019d been out for a run or on her way home from one of her consulting jobs. She often checked in, asking Eric what they should do for dinner. When Mac filled up the sheriff\u2019s department SUV, he managed to stay awhile because the crew at Lucky\u2019s made good company. Such was the case with many residents. And, of course, there were Ray Anne\u2019s visits, seldom for a full tank and never in a big hurry. If Al was aware she was at the pump, he took the job. He wiped off his hands, excused the rest of the garage team and spent a little quality time on Ray Anne\u2019s little BMW. He knew he did a lot of grinning while she was there.</p><p>Eric said, \u201cYou ever wonder how she walks in those shoes?\u201d</p> <p>Al had lifted a brow and said, \u201cWalking is way overrated.\u201d</p><p>On one of her passes through the station she said, \u201cI guess I\u2019ll see you tomorrow night at Cliff\u2019s, since it\u2019s your night off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cYou know, one of these nights you\u2019ll have to stay for dinner....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had dinner there a time or two,\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cBut I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s about time for something Italian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said, clearly disappointed.</p> <p>\u201cYou can probably recommend a good place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m a full-service Realtor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you could. Let\u2019s see\u2014I\u2019ll get to Cliff\u2019s around five. Maybe five-thirty. That\u2019s about when you get there, right? You think of some good Italian place and I\u2019ll take you out. How\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>The disappointment on her face melted instantly into a look of pure pleasure. \u201cThat would be perfect. I know all the best restaurants in Coos County.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not surprised.\u201d</p><p>Al found himself looking forward to a dinner out with Ray Anne more than he\u2019d looked forward to a date in a long while, and it was entirely successful, starting with their hysterical laughter when he folded himself up in her BMW. \u201cI don\u2019t know if this is gonna work,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t get in that truck!\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cIt\u2019s as far off the ground as I am tall! And I\u2019m in a tight skirt and heels!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd those heels do you proud, too. You don\u2019t weigh much. I could pick you up and throw you in,\u201d he suggested.</p> <p>\u201cAw, you don\u2019t think I weigh much? Not only do I love you for that, I can eat more Italian tonight than I\u2019d planned to. Now just put your chin on your knees like a good boy and let me worry about getting you there!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrive carefully,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you hit a berm or pylon, I\u2019ll have to have my knees removed from the back of my head.\u201d</p><p>She took him to a hole-in-the-wall restaurant decorated with plastic vines and grapes and he told her he\u2019d forgotten his reading glasses and asked her to order for them both. She did an expert job and they laughed all through dinner. He wanted to know all about what it was like growing up in Coos County and she wanted to know what it was like just moving from job to job with no real commitments.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not exactly like that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve worked for a few of the same people, like Eric, who are willing to hire me even though I don\u2019t seem to be looking for a career. In a dozen years I\u2019ve worked for Eric several different times, then I\u2019d hear from someone who needs help or wants me back for a contract they can\u2019t fulfill without extra help. I don\u2019t like the north in the winter, I don\u2019t like the south in the summer. I\u2019m not saving up for a European vacation or big house, that\u2019s just how I roll. I like Eric. I don\u2019t work for people who don\u2019t prove to me they\u2019re honest and straightforward and Eric is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll move on and probably come back in six months or a year?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He tilted his head, wrinkled his brow and said, \u201cThat just seems to be the way of it. Maybe I like too many things. I like driving a truck, like mechanics, and since I was raised on a farm, that still has appeal. I go back to Iowa just about every year even though there\u2019s hardly anyone there I know anymore. Sometimes I hang around, help out old neighbors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the family farm?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWe gave it up. Sold it. There\u2019s just my sister and me. She gave her half to charity and I put my half into a few bonds and a new truck. It wasn\u2019t that much land. It seemed like way too much farm when I was working it, but once it was for sale it turned out to be a little dinky farm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you miss it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t want to be a farmer all alone and with no other siblings and my parents gone, it didn\u2019t hold much appeal. Plus, it didn\u2019t take me long to see I could do without those really bad Midwestern winters....\u201d</p><p>Ray Anne, he learned, loved what she did and where she did it. Loved it with a passion. Thunder Point was an easy place to live, she knew everyone, and her work took her all over Coos County and beyond. She loved being with people all day, as many days a week as she could stand it. She had a few really good friends in town, made a decent if modest living, mostly by managing rental property in the area, and life was as she liked it\u2014maybe not cosmopolitan but satisfying. \u201cIf I could\u2019ve talked Cooper out of that beachfront property, the commission would\u2019ve been incredible, but the greedy bastard wouldn\u2019t let it go. I love him, but that was on the selfish side.\u201d</p><p>When they finally left the restaurant after a long dinner, Ray Anne drove them back to Cliff\u2019s, Al\u2019s chin on his knees. His truck sat in the parking lot, looking pretty lonely. It was late and the restaurant was near closing.</p><p>She turned toward him. \u201cIf you\u2019re interested, you could follow me home to my house for a nightcap or cup of coffee.\u201d</p><p>Al frowned a little bit. He gently touched her shoulder. \u201cListen, that\u2019s nice. I have to mention a couple of things. You already know\u2014I\u2019m not likely to be here long-term. If I\u2019m here a year, that\u2019s real long-term for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cIf I date you a month, you\u2019re really something. I didn\u2019t ask you if you wanted to make an investment. I asked you if you wanted a drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe other thing...I was married. It was a while ago. Over thirty years. I wasn\u2019t good at it. I haven\u2019t been tempted since.\u201d</p><p>And she laughed.</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t think that\u2019s funny,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI do, as a matter of fact. I\u2019ve been married three times. I\u2019m a very slow learner. Apparently I\u2019m not good at it, either. And I\u2019m not looking for a family, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d he asked. \u201cBecause I like you, but I don\u2019t want to end up in a bad situation. You know\u2014where we\u2019re angry at each other because of someone\u2019s failed expectations. I like my job, the town, you, and I hate drama. I\u2019d like things easy. Do you know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we start with a drink?\u201d she asked. \u201cI like you, too. I think I\u2019m past romantic expectations. Or illusions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old are you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cForty-two,\u201d she said. \u201cOr fifty-two. Or sixty-one. I can never remember. How important is that?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cShow me the way, Ms. Ray Anne.\u201d</p><p>He pried himself out of that little car, found his way into his truck with some relief in his joints. He followed her to a little house up the hill. It was a comfortable, small house, maybe a little overdecorated\u2014lots of mirrors and candles and other girlie things. He had a Scotch. It turned out there was no duct tape or bailing wire involved in her figure\u2014Ray Anne was nicely put together.</p><p>He left in the morning. With a smile on his face.</p><p>When Laine stopped by the diner on her way home one sunny afternoon, Ashley was behind the counter. She said, \u201cMom said to send you out to Cooper\u2019s if you dropped by today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s an impromptu hen party. In the sun for a change, instead of in a back booth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a good plan,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m walking and leaving my car right where it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure my new stepfather doesn\u2019t tow it, how\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a generous woman,\u201d Laine said with a laugh.</p><p>By the time she got just past the marina she could hear the laughter of women floating down the beach. It put a little spring in her step. How long had it really been since she\u2019d had the kind of women friends who could laugh like idiots over every other comment? She\u2019d had women friends, of course, even though law enforcement was still dominated by men. But friends like these\u2014from various walks of life, from waitress to Coast Guard pilot recently retired? Not even in college! If Eric was the greatest benefit from this hiatus from the FBI, the women here were a close second.</p><p>She could see them up there, commanding the deck. They had pulled a couple of tables together, divided by generation. At one small, round table sat Lou McCain and her best friends Carrie James, Gina\u2019s mother and the deli owner, and Ray Anne Dysart, Realtor extraordinaire. At the table next to them were Gina, then Sarah, Cooper\u2019s very pregnant wife, and Devon.</p><p>\u201cLaine! Hurry! You have to hear this!\u201d Gina shouted.</p><p>Laine took the steps two at a time.</p><p>\u201cMaybe she already knows,\u201d Ray Anne said.</p><p>\u201cKnow what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s seeing Al, from the station,\u201d Lou announced.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say \u2018seeing,\u2019\u201d Ray Anne corrected. \u201cI said we\u2019d been out to dinner a couple of times. We happened to show up for happy hour at Cliff\u2019s more than once, decided to have dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt Cliffhanger\u2019s?\u201d Laine asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, no. We just went to Bandon\u2014not too far. We had Italian once. And once we went out for Chinese. And ended up getting takeout...\u201d She fluttered her lashes.</p><p>Everyone howled.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s he like that pole-dancing routine?\u201d Lou asked, laughing.</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, I took pole-dancing lessons to keep my legs in shape and he said he liked what I did to a pair of high heels. So there! He\u2019s very polite. Not like you, Louise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is polite,\u201d Laine acknowledged. \u201cVery nice man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHandsome man,\u201d Sarah said. \u201cHe\u2019s been out here a couple of times and he pumped my gas last week. He has very good teeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he does,\u201d Ray Anne said. \u201cI\u2019m not even sure how old he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but does he know how old you are?\u201d Carrie asked.</p><p>\u201cPfffttt. I don\u2019t even know how old I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do,\u201d Carrie and Lou said in unison, making everyone laugh again.</p><p>Laine reached over and gave Sarah\u2019s hand a pat. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure where I\u2019m going to put two more months of little girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA girl, then?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Sarah smiled a little sentimentally. \u201cExactly what I ordered. We have Landon\u2014he\u2019s graduating in June. And Cooper has Austin. A girl should fit in just right. I asked Cooper to give me a girl and he got right on it.\u201d Then she grinned. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cIs the house going to be done in time?\u201d Laine asked.</p><p>Cooper appeared in the doorway. \u201cThe way she\u2019s riding the contractors, they\u2019re afraid for their lives. They\u2019ll make it. Something to drink, Laine?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cWhatever the big girls are drinking, I\u2019ll have one.\u201d</p><p>He ran a hand over Sarah\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHoney?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWater?\u201d she asked, looking up at him sweetly.</p><p>He leaned down and kissed her forehead and all the women said, \u201cAwwww\u201d at the same time.</p><p>Sarah looked over her shoulder, following Cooper\u2019s departure back into the bar. Then she leaned close to the women to share. \u201cHave you heard of those pregnant women who just crave sex all the time?\u201d she asked in a lowered tone. They all leaned forward expectantly. \u201cI\u2019m not one of them,\u201d she said.</p> <p>And they came apart in laughter yet again.</p><p>\u201cHow about the baby daddy?\u201d Lou asked.</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d Sarah said. \u201cYou think he\u2019d be intimidated by this big mound, but no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to talk about the shower,\u201d Gina said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had a really good party since their wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of shower?\u201d Sarah asked.</p><p>They all looked at her very strangely. Cooper chose that moment to bring her a water and Laine a glass of wine. \u201cBaby, Sarah,\u201d he said. \u201cBaby shower. You\u2019re pregnant.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI mean, just for girls? Or for men, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, please,\u201d Cooper said, pathetically. \u201cFor girls. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut sweetheart, I want you to be involved, to be able to play all the baby games!\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d he said, turning away. \u201cCan\u2019t you just shoot me?\u201d he was heard to mutter inside the bar.</p><p>When he was gone the women were laughing again. \u201cYou have no idea the strain Cooper is under,\u201d Sarah said. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to do everything he can to make me happy, to help me, and a couples shower might put him over the edge. Right now he\u2019d give anything to trade places with me. For one pass on a baby shower, he\u2019d be willing to carry her and push her out.\u201d</p><p>An hour later Laine and Devon were walking back across the beach together. Lou was dropping off Gina at home, Carrie was hanging around the beach a little while to talk to Rawley about his deli orders for the rest of the week, Ray Anne was off in her fancy little car to get a little work done.</p><p>\u201cDo you have to go back to work?\u201d Laine asked her.</p><p>\u201cScott\u2019s holding down the fort. I\u2019ll at least check appointments, messages and ask him if anything\u2019s going on before I head out for the day. Spencer is coaching track and field till the end of term so he won\u2019t be done early and I have kids to pick up in an hour. How about you? Done for the day?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExcept to check the computer to see if I have any emails. Not urgent. A night like tonight deserves something on the grill. I think I\u2019ll run by the station and see what Eric is in the mood for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him I said hi.\u201d</p><p>They parted in the street. Laine took her car from the front of the diner while Devon went into the clinic. She drove the short distance to the garage, but parked in front of the big doors and not at the pump. She went inside to find that Eric was leaning into an engine and the long legs sticking out from under the car must have belonged to Al. Eric ducked out from under the hood and looked at her. He grabbed a rag from the back pocket of his coverall. His eyes sparkled and he smiled as he wiped his hands.</p><p>She had found him in January, moved him in with her in February. It was the middle of April and he still looked at her as if she were brand-new. It hadn\u2019t been that long, really, but still... There was something about that look, that twinkle, that smile that promised he would see her that way forever.</p><p>She had not known she could have this kind of life.</p><p>The next day Eric had errands in Bandon\u2014he was in search of some new tires for a customer and a haircut for himself. He stopped at a small market on the edge of town\u2014his assignment from Laine had been baby blond potatoes, Vidalia onions, two large carrots, frozen peas, sour cream and Dijon mustard. He had no idea what this would become, something that was going to combine with chicken, but his mouth watered just the same. She was so right about him\u2014it turned him on to see her cook. What a throwback to an earlier time he was. Also on his list was a box of tampons. He figured that was some kind of test, like a husband test. He laughed at himself. He should bring home a boat and rod and reel instead, like the old joke\u2014guy goes into a store for tampons and comes home with a bunch of sporting equipment because the salesman convinced him, Well, you might as well go fishing....</p><p>He didn\u2019t even have the first item in the basket when he saw Justin. He was alone, pushing a cart away from Eric.</p><p>It was probably the sight of Justin\u2019s shaggy haircut that caused Eric to run a hand around the back of his neck. He\u2019d just gotten himself a nice trim and suddenly he knew quite a few things. Justin wasn\u2019t getting a haircut in a barber shop, he wasn\u2019t in school, he was shopping for food for the family. Was he the man of the house, with his father gone and his mother unemployed?</p><p>Eric followed him a little, pretending to look at certain items, glancing out of his peripheral vision to see where the kid was headed. It didn\u2019t take him long before he was checking out. He used some kind of credit card. This didn\u2019t take a brilliant investigator\u2014the cashier didn\u2019t smile, Justin looked down, the total was reached, Justin bagged his own groceries and took back the card and the receipt. It had to be a voucher for food, the new form of food stamps. But what was he doing way over here? There was a grocery store in Thunder Point.</p><p>Justin left the store and Eric finally got around to getting the rest of the items on his list. He was back at the garage just after lunch. It wasn\u2019t unusual for Al to be there already, though he was early. During the morning and early afternoon Eric could leave the station in Manny\u2019s capable hands with either Norm or Howie or both to help him, while the afternoon and evening were his with Al, sometimes Justin and one of the old boys.</p><p>Eric put his vegetables in the refrigerator they kept in the garage. He went to talk to Al.</p><p>\u201cSo, what can you tell me about Justin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKid\u2019s doing great,\u201d Al said. \u201cHe\u2019s keeping up with his regular work, learning new things, writing up invoices and even helping with ordering parts. He\u2019s a whiz on the computer. He likes it, his mood is civilized, he\u2019s good with customers. He\u2019s happy twenty-five percent of the time, which for a seventeen-year-old boy is very positive.\u201d Al grinned. \u201cHe has a lot of family responsibility\u2014two younger brothers and a mother who isn\u2019t well too much of the time. I noticed that\u2019s typical around here.... Not sick mothers, but kids with a lot of family responsibility\u2014they help on family fishing boats, they help farm or deliver produce, they take on part-time jobs to help out, to pay for extras, like their own underwear. It\u2019s like where I grew up in Boone. We thought it was normal.\u201d And Al smiled his friendly smile.</p><p>\u201cYou have any idea what\u2019s wrong with his mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo idea,\u201d Al said. \u201cSounds like she\u2019s got some kind of chronic thing\u2014Justin said she has regular bouts and the doctor looks after her, but she needs the kids to help with chores. With all he\u2019s got on his plate, he\u2019s holding up real fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy part-time job was my undoing,\u201d Eric said. \u201cIt went too well. I dropped out of school because I thought I was making the big bucks. Justin wasn\u2019t in school today. I saw him in a grocery store over in Bandon. I don\u2019t like the idea he\u2019s skipping school. That could lead to him skipping too much school...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant me to talk to him?\u201d Al asked.</p><p>\u201cNah, let me. He likes you better\u2014keep it that way. Stay on his good side. Let me be the bad guy, see if I can figure out what\u2019s going on with him. Then you can pick him up, dust him off, talk sense to him.\u201d He took a breath. \u201cAl, it\u2019s not good for him to quit learning so early....\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s learning,\u201d Al said with a frown. \u201cHe\u2019s growing in this job. He\u2019s got good instincts, good hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like him to have better odds than I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou landed on top, man,\u201d Al said. \u201cTwice!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was lucky. If you don\u2019t have luck along with determination, it can get bleak.\u201d</p><p>When Justin came in, Eric tried to talk to him, but it was a waste of time, except to make Justin pretty mad. \u201cMy mom\u2019s doing great, but she needs our help. She\u2019s in a wheelchair and if you know anything about people in a wheelchair, they\u2019re pretty easy targets for falls, for things like pneumonia, that kind of thing. And she takes medicine, so someone needs to be close by in case she needs help with something. She can\u2019t be cooking and shit like that. She can\u2019t drive anymore. So, that enough information or does my job require copies of medical records?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to know if there\u2019s any way I can help,\u201d Eric said in frustration.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Gimme hours. She doesn\u2019t work, doesn\u2019t get support from my dad, and we\u2019re stretched pretty tight. If you\u2019re not gonna give me hours, stay outta my personal life. Do I ask you about your personal life?\u201d</p><p>Eric shrugged. \u201cSometimes,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t really piss me off as much as this pisses you off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell you what,\u201d Justin said. \u201cIf I need anything, I\u2019ll let you know. For right now all I need is hours. I\u2019ll take whatever hours you can give me. After three in the afternoon, at least after two, and all day and all night Saturday and Sunday. That\u2019s what I need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou skipped school today,\u201d Eric said. \u201cI saw you at a grocery store near Bandon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, dude. I had to take my mother to the doctor. I stopped to get a couple of things. She was still in the car, waiting.\u201d But when he said that, he flushed. \u201cWe get along fine. Leave it alone.\u201d</p><p>And so Eric said to Al, \u201cI can\u2019t crack that one. He\u2019s all yours.\u201d</p><p>Later that same day when Eric had gone home, Justin said to Al, \u201cAny chance you can tell me how to replace break shoes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell you?\u201d Al repeated. \u201cWhat good is telling you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe breaks on the van are slow and sometimes they cry. I\u2019m going to have to do something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only one who drives the van, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2014the boys are too young and my mom can\u2019t drive anymore. But I drive everyone everywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt seven, when the place slows down, go get the van and bring it to the garage. We\u2019re gonna do brakes. We\u2019ll call it on-the-job training.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to do it myself,\u201d Justin said. \u201cWe\u2019re on a tight budget. I can get parts cheaper somewhere else....\u201d</p><p>Al put a hand on his shoulder. \u201cKid, we\u2019re gonna do it here. We\u2019re gonna do it on the house. Now go home and get the van. Tell the boys you could be a little late tonight. We\u2019re gonna service that vehicle, check everything, change the oil, give it a lube, go down the checklist, make sure you have first-rate transportation....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t do that. If Eric finds out and thinks I\u2019m taking freebies from the station...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you asked Eric he would be glad to help. You asked me and I\u2019m glad to help. We\u2019re not going to cover it up\u2014I\u2019m going to tell Eric we worked on your van. We\u2019re going to document it. I\u2019m going to train you and Lucky\u2019s will be glad to eat the cost of parts because Eric is good to his employees. I work on my truck right here, Manny takes care of his vehicles here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cYou sure he won\u2019t get mad? Because I need this job, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d Al said. \u201cGo get the van. If it\u2019s not busy tonight, we\u2019ll be done by eleven. Otherwise, we\u2019ll work till the van is perfect. Safe and dependable. How does that sound?\u201d</p> <p>Justin\u2019s lips got a little pink around the edges. His eyes might\u2019ve gotten a little glassy. But all he said was, \u201cThat\u2019d be real good, Al. You ever need a favor, all you have to do is ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, friends take care of each other. Friends can count on each other.\u201d</p><p>Twelve</p><p>Laine asked Eric if he could take an afternoon off to go somewhere with her and of course he arranged it. He\u2019d do anything she asked and she knew it. She drove him a little over an hour away to a river in Douglas County, down a lonely, tree-lined road. He kept asking where they were going and she told him to be patient.</p><p>She finally pulled up to a closed gate. A county sheriff\u2019s car was parked outside the gate and Laine jumped out, flashed her badge, chatted with him for a moment. They laughed together over something, then she got back in the car while the deputy opened the gate.</p> <p>Eric was catching on\u2014there was yellow crime-scene tape on the fencing. And an armed officer. \u201cIs this place being guarded?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s under routine surveillance. We still have two suspects at large, although I\u2019m sure they\u2019re nowhere near here. Police do regular inventory of the contents of the buildings on the property to be sure nothing is missing or disturbed. Everything that amounts to evidence has been taken out of here and we don\u2019t expect our suspects to return, but one never knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, this is the place,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is where it all happened.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath. She nodded. \u201cThe commune. The place. This is the second time I\u2019ve been back. The first was not long after my injury and surgery. Agents brought me back to walk through the property, go over the events and give them a tour. It wasn\u2019t easy\u2014I couldn\u2019t document things while I was here. I did pass information through the fence behind the chicken coop, but that was infrequent. It really smelled back there\u2014Jacob\u2019s \u2018soldiers\u2019 didn\u2019t like to go back there to check the security of the place and the brush and trees grew up against the fence so it was a very unlikely place for anyone to break in...or out. When I came back with agents I was still taking some pain medication so I did my best, but I didn\u2019t really register what I was seeing or remembering. Want to see the place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to show me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to see it again. I wanted to look at it with some objectivity. The women and children lived over there, in the big house. There were only six women when I got here but the place was built for twenty, plus children. When the women began to thin out, there was more space.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAt first glance, it looks like such a safe place,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI know. The entire estate is beautiful. On this side of the river there were livestock, massive organic gardens, chicken coops, the house and barn, corral, playground. The animals have been removed for their welfare. There\u2019s a bridge across the river\u2014on the other side were the men\u2019s bunkhouse, Jacob\u2019s house and two warehouses that Jacob said held supplies, equipment and some of his experimental organic plants. They were warehouses dedicated to marijuana plants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA big federal crime,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWe thought it was a big federal case before I saw the pot,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was bringing these poor, destitute women here, from out of state in some cases. We were afraid he was going to wage war on the establishment. It\u2019s possible that was his endgame, but at the time he was getting rich illegally and holding captive women and children.\u201d She looked around. \u201cIf people had had the freedom to come and go as they pleased and if he didn\u2019t have an impressive drug farm on the property, this could have been an amazing little commune. Of course, it would\u2019ve been very poor. And there was the little matter of being led by an ego-driven lunatic, but merely being crazy is not against the law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will happen to this place?\u201d Eric asked.</p><p>\u201cAuction, I suppose. Come and see,\u201d she said, leading him to the house.</p><p>It was a beautiful structure undamaged by the fire, a large Victorian style with huge rooms and a wraparound porch. Inside it was not only abandoned and deserted, but also dirty and cluttered. Detectives had plowed through every drawer and cupboard, but of course, nothing was put back. It was plundered in search of evidence.</p><p>The kitchen was enormous with a long, family-style table that could seat at least twenty. \u201cThe family ate here. The women, children, Jacob and often the men who watched over the place.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you cook for the family?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI had chores and sometimes I had chores in the kitchen, but they didn\u2019t know I could cook. Or that I liked to cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? That\u2019s important to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, lots of reasons. My backstory\u2014I was poor, down on my luck. I wouldn\u2019t have had the means. And...I wouldn\u2019t bring my mother into this. It was subtle, but it was perverse.\u201d She walked through the kitchen and out the back door. She started down the porch steps, then stopped and sat down. \u201cThe women who lived here were all afraid of the same thing\u2014that they had no options, no choices. They let Jacob have his way because that made him happy and while he was happy, they had safety and plenty to eat. They had children and nowhere to go. They were afraid if they left, if they ran away, they wouldn\u2019t survive. Since they\u2019d been in shelters or living on the streets before he found them, it wasn\u2019t too hard for him to convince them that\u2019s all they were worth.\u201d</p><p>Eric sat down beside her and took her hand.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t imagine how much I wanted to start working to convince them they\u2019d been manipulated, tricked. Brainwashed. But I couldn\u2019t. I had to be one of them so we could get to the bottom of what was going on here. And of course, get them out before Jacob and his little militia used them as shields. I had to take my time, sneak them out slowly so it would seem they ran away, so they wouldn\u2019t give me or anyone inside away. It was hard to go slowly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you wanted to see it again,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy did you bring me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asked me about it. I wanted you to see it.\u201d She pointed to the structure across the river, half burned down, half just charred. One of the warehouses was just a lump of black ash, the other was still standing. \u201cThat\u2019s Jacob\u2019s house, half-standing. The bunkhouse is gone\u2014it was next to the burned warehouse. The house is where I was shot. Then I got Mercy, Devon\u2019s little girl, and we hid in the river while Jacob drove away. He went straight down the river then took some hidden back road I didn\u2019t know about. And not long after he escaped, Rawley found us. It was Rawley, Cooper, Spencer and Devon. Spencer carried me down the road to the police blockade, where I got medical attention. But none of those men knew me or were in it to rescue me. Devon was coming after her child and they wouldn\u2019t let her come out here without them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must have been terrified,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBefore I passed out, yeah. Before we were rescued I heard a shot in the house\u2014the woman I had to leave behind. She was the only one I couldn\u2019t get out and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get over that. Right after that shot was fired and Jacob was gone, I passed out. I woke up in the ambulance for a minute, just long enough for them to knock me out again. Then long enough in the E.R. to hear the doctor explain I was going to surgery. The news that I would have died had I not been rescued is still kind of hazy to me. Surreal. Or, out of reality, maybe. I never had any of those near-death visions or anything. What I had was pain in my shoulder and neck. White-hot, blinding pain. And before that was resolved, I was on a plane back to Virginia, where the self-proclaimed best orthopedic surgeon in Boston was waiting for me so he could look at my medical records and treatment options.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father,\u201d Eric said. \u201cWas he awful?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cHe restrained himself. I think he could tell by one look at my expression, which was not tolerant, I wasn\u2019t putting up with anything from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he was there,\u201d Eric said.</p><p>\u201cHe was. And he stayed for days...days without giving me any shit about my job\u2014a record for Senior. My shoulder fixed up pretty quick but my elbow was killing me until a few weeks ago. I mean, what\u2019s that about? I didn\u2019t get shot in the elbow!\u201d</p><p>He laughed at her. She was the strongest, bravest woman he\u2019d ever met.</p><p>\u201cI must have fallen on it, that\u2019s what the surgeon said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t stay on the East coast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s the other thing I wanted to tell you. I thought I was running away from Senior and at the same time, getting a think break from the office. But I was really coming back for this. I just didn\u2019t realize it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI needed closure. I had to see this place disarmed. I wanted to know it was really over. Behind me.\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath. \u201cDo you have some closure now?\u201d he asked hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cThere are things you should know. If you\u2019re not beside me, I like a dim light on at night or I can\u2019t fall asleep. I have dreams\u2014sometimes I hear a gunshot. I refuse to tell anyone from work that this is hard for me because they want to be accepting, but they would judge me as \u2018affected.\u2019 I\u2019m not. I\u2019m just a person recovering from a violent crime. I\u2019m not the strongest person alive. I\u2019m strong, but not infallible. And I needed to do this with you, Eric. I want you to know the truth about me\u2014that I get scared like anyone would, that I\u2019m vulnerable sometimes, and that you\u2019re the only person I trust enough to be completely honest with. I always told Pax I was fine\u2014I wouldn\u2019t let the agents I worked with know how messed up I felt, sometimes still feel. I could never tell Senior. To survive something like this,\u201d she said, waving a hand at their surroundings, \u201conly to be called an idiot\u2014it was the last straw. But I want you to know the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happens when you have closure?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I was kind of hoping for a mysterious calm. I do get the sense that one small edge that gnawed at me is defused. It\u2019s like when the doctor is coming at you with a syringe with a big fat needle in it\u2014and the needle is gone and it\u2019s just a syringe. Harmless. And right this minute, I don\u2019t feel scared, but that\u2019s not just about this compound being disarmed. It\u2019s about seeing it with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never let on that anything about it bothered you. You\u2019re the most controlled person I know.\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly. \u201cI\u2019ve just about got that perfected, huh? I can look that way when I have to. It\u2019s just a look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thinking about going back to work or something?\u201d he wanted to know.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI like this consulting work. I\u2019m happy doing that. Poor bastards\u2014if there\u2019s anything sketchy to be found, I\u2019m going to find it. Force of habit, I guess. And a really good nose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not heading home? To Virginia?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head again. \u201cYou ready to be rid of me?\u201d</p><p>He gave a short laugh. \u201cI keep waiting for the other shoe to drop. You keep me wondering, keep me surprised. You asked me for a date, you asked me for that first kiss, you wanted me to spend the first night, you wanted me to share closet space. One of these days you\u2019re going to be ready for something more. Or maybe something different. Or ready to be finished with this, with us. I\u2019m getting sore muscles from bracing myself.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cI like my life,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve gained five pounds, have you noticed that? As much as I run and work out, I still gained five pounds. Most of it on the ass, by the way. I think it\u2019s from having so much time to cook and eat. But I think it also might be from just being wound down a few notches. I\u2019m so relaxed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t miss the adrenaline?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI get an adrenaline rush when it\u2019s time for you to come home from the station....\u201d</p> <p>He leaned closer and kissed her cheek. \u201cI like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting that commendation from the FBI,\u201d she said. \u201cThe one Senior said he refused to celebrate. I wanted to come here one more time, look at where it happened, close the door. I thought by now I might be itching to get back to it, on to the next case. Hopefully the biggest case yet. But instead I have the feeling I\u2019ve gone as far as I need to go in the Bureau. I might be ready to move on to the next chapter in my life. It\u2019s so funny that it would be in Oregon. In a little dinky town in Oregon, close to where I could have lost my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we leave?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Does it give you the creeps? Thinking about it?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYou like your life now. That includes me. That makes me want to be alone with you, make out with you for a while. But not here where that other life was. I want to be alone with you. No ghosts. No edge. No needle.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled at him. \u201cYou asking me to step away from that job I had? The one that gives you scary pictures in your head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I convinced myself that if that\u2019s what it took to keep you happy, I could shut off my brain. I know you can do anything. Anything. No matter how difficult or scary.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cMy mother used to say that capable was my middle name. She said I would do what I set my mind to, no matter how hard it was, and impossible tasks would just take me a little longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s you. The idea that you\u2019re ready to try a new kind of adrenaline, a new kind of restless, I could live with that. And about the five pounds? I hadn\u2019t noticed, but I like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love me,\u201d she said, grinning at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not making out with you here, in front of the cop, in the shadow of a place where you risked everything. Come with me now. Let me drive us home. Let me find an abandoned farm road and pull over and show you. Anyone can say it. I want to show it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWill you go back to D.C. with me when I get my commendation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want me to, I will. I\u2019m proud of you. No, it\u2019s bigger than that. I admire what you can do, what you\u2019re willing to do. You amaze me. I have a feeling you always will.\u201d</p><p>She stood up and pulled on his hand. \u201cYou have a way with words. I\u2019m just a glutton for praise. Take me out of here.\u201d</p><p>Laine was making a blackberry pie when her cell phone rang. She wiped off her hands, looked at it, saw it was her brother and answered cheerily. \u201cHey, Pax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot a minute?\u201d he asked. His voice sounded grave.</p><p>\u201cSure. What\u2019s up? How is everyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all good\u2014headed for the last weeks of school before summer.\u201d And he ran through a litany of what was happening with each female in his world.</p><p>\u201cAnd how\u2019s Senior?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cNot completely sure,\u201d Pax said. \u201cThere\u2019s some kind of drama with him that I really don\u2019t get. I heard through the grapevine that a couple of weeks ago, he left the O.R. after a patient had been anesthetized and didn\u2019t come back. He didn\u2019t come back all day. He didn\u2019t answer his cell phone for hours. When he finally did answer a call from the head nurse in O.R., he said he\u2019d had the phone turned off\u2014he was playing golf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlaying golf?\u201d she asked. \u201cWait a minute...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard this right. He put a patient under for a knee replacement, excused himself, walked out of the O.R. and apparently, out of the hospital. The O.R. staff went looking for him and couldn\u2019t find him. Ultimately, they woke the patient and said they were worried that something had happened to the surgeon, maybe he was suddenly ill or something. Since the surgery is elective, they discharged the patient and rescheduled him with Senior\u2019s partner for a week later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis can\u2019t be right. There must be something else.\u201d</p><p>Pax took a breath. \u201cI\u2019d talked to him a few times the past couple of weeks. Briefly, but we talked. He never mentioned this. Not once. I called his office and they said he was out and asked if I\u2019d tried to reach him on his cell. I called him again, but this time I told him what I\u2019d heard and he got angry\u2014said it was a schedule conflict, that he wasn\u2019t supposed to be there in the first place and had turned the case over to the resident, who was more than capable. He said he didn\u2019t know why the resident didn\u2019t finish the case. He blamed the resident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Laine said. \u201cYou think he got pissed about something and stormed out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe must have got into it with someone. But that\u2019s not like him, not really. I can name a dozen surgeons who pop off, swear at their O.R. staff, throw things...Senior actually has a good reputation in the O.R. Generally speaking, people like to work with him. When he\u2019s at his worst he\u2019s critical or snide. He rarely loses his temper....\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust with me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an old problem, you and Senior,\u201d Pax said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of those things between the two of you and I\u2019ve never understood. Let me be clear\u2014I don\u2019t understand his point of view....\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, do you think it finally happened? That it\u2019s my fault and I put him completely over the edge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t take that on. No, I don\u2019t think that. This is completely out of character. But he said someone filed a complaint and he\u2019s not seeing patients for a couple of weeks. Totally weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell... Is he going to get sued or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think so. The office seems to be running interference. Apparently he\u2019s been a little unreliable the past year or so, but he\u2019s seventy. He cut back on his patient load and surgery after Mom died. He\u2019s been talking about retirement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, if he retires, you\u2019ll be stuck with him in your business all the time. Unless he gets a woman. Pax, could he have a woman? A girlfriend? He never did that before. He was pretty flaky after Mom died but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one mentioned a woman,\u201d Pax said. \u201cHe blew me off. He said it was no big deal, that it was a scheduling mistake, that he wouldn\u2019t have left the O.R. unless he was either finished or someone else was taking over the case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he has some health issue he doesn\u2019t want to talk about,\u201d Laine said. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s on medication and it\u2019s making him loopy\u2014like blood pressure medicine. Or Viagra?\u201d</p><p>Pax laughed in spite of himself.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Okay. Talk to the housekeeper, Mrs. Mulligrew\u2014she\u2019s been around almost as long as we have. She probably knows more about him than we ever did. Trust me, the cleaning lady knows all\u2014ask her to check in the medicine cabinet. Is he close to his nurse? It\u2019s a fairly new nurse, right? Pax? Can I do anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not why I called you. I only mentioned it to keep you up to speed. I\u2019ll look into it, but I wanted to know how you are. I had a few minutes to talk and... I\u2019ll talk to Mrs. Mulligrew, that\u2019s good advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t have time for this,\u201d she said. \u201cYou barely have time to talk to your own wife and kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re on the outs with Senior, which doesn\u2019t lend itself to open communication, even if you weren\u2019t in Oregon. I\u2019ll handle it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to abandon you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see it that way. I miss you, but you did the right thing. There are boundaries and I wouldn\u2019t put up with that kind of constant criticism from anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t want me to serve up my new number and talk to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you can just tell me how you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m getting more interesting, as a matter of fact,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew I wanted a change of scenery and I had a lot of logical reasons for trying out Oregon for a while, but none of them made a lot of sense to me until a couple of days ago. I went back to the commune, to the scene of the crime. I suddenly realized that was something I had to do\u2014not only to completely understand what happened, but to close the door on it. I didn\u2019t even realize how heavy that baggage was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could you not?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI\u2019m disciplined. And I never take time off. Real time. I have vacations here and there, but I haven\u2019t had any real space from the Bureau in years. I\u2019ve been thinking about something, but you have to promise me you won\u2019t mention it to Senior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m good with your secrets....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking ten years is enough. I think I\u2019ve given the Bureau just about all I have to give them.\u201d Complete silence answered her. \u201cPax?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, I think the call was dropped. I thought I heard you say you were done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll miss the excitement eventually. You\u2019ve been eating stress three meals a day for over a decade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m full,\u201d she said with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s him,\u201d Pax said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being ridiculous. Would you stop your fellowship because you\u2019re crazy about Genevieve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean. I didn\u2019t mean you\u2019d give up the Bureau because you\u2019re into him. I think being with him has made you look at your life differently. It\u2019s okay, Auntie Lainie. Life is very big, you know. And only one thing is required.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really? And what\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat when you\u2019re done with it, you don\u2019t have regrets about your choices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t we all have regrets about some of our choices?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the really important ones.\u201d</p><p>She was quiet for a long time. Finally she said, \u201cDon\u2019t make me think too hard. Let me be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. And in case you need permission, I\u2019ll encourage you to stay happy.\u201d</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>The busiest time of day at Lucky\u2019s was from three to six when school let out and folks were getting home from work. That\u2019s when they\u2019d gas up for the next day or bring in a problem they had with the engine. That\u2019s when Eric had the most hands on duty. After six things slowed way down. His employees who were not scheduled to work after six could start leaving then, including himself.</p><p>Justin came in at three. As usual, he got right to work. At three-twenty Eric answered the phone. \u201cLucky\u2019s full service, Eric speaking.\u201d</p><p>The young voice, clearly rattled, said, \u201cCan I talk to Justin. It\u2019s Danny, his brother.\u201d</p><p>Eric called Justin to the phone and overheard Justin\u2019s part of the conversation. \u201cDid you try to sit her up? Call Doc Grant\u2019s cell phone and 911. I\u2019m on my way.\u201d He hung up and saw Eric\u2019s stunned expression. \u201cI gotta go. My mom.\u201d And he took off at a dead run.</p><p>Justin might be in shock, Eric thought. He watched the kid run out of the station and down the street. He ran like he had only seconds; it was a total sprint. Before the sight of him racing down the street faded, Al was standing in front of him, questions in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cHe got a call,\u201d Eric said. \u201cSomething about his mom.\u201d</p><p>And then as though Eric caught the same virus, he bolted for his Jeep, wrangling keys out of his pocket as he jogged. Behind him he heard Al shout, \u201cHowie, pump gas! Shut it down if necessary. We got an emergency.\u201d And then he was at the passenger door to the Jeep, opening it up and jumping inside even as Eric was backing out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Al asked.</p><p>\u201cNo idea,\u201d Eric said, making a T-turn to head after Justin. And man, could that kid run, even wearing his station coveralls and steel-toed boots, he was like the damn wind. When the Jeep came up behind him and Eric gave the horn a blast, Justin didn\u2019t even slow down.</p> <p>\u201cPull alongside,\u201d Al commanded, lowering his window.</p><p>Justin had already run through town, past the diner and sheriff\u2019s office, three more blocks and up the hill.</p><p>\u201cJustin!\u201d Al yelled, leaning out the window. \u201cGet in! We\u2019ll drive you!\u201d</p><p>But the kid didn\u2019t even slow down. He just kept running, pumping his arms, panting, his floppy hair slicked back with wind and sweat. Uphill, and still flying.</p><p>Al pulled back inside. \u201cJust follow him,\u201d he told Eric.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell is he doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find out soon enough. We either let him wear out or I get out and chase him and tackle him and I\u2019m not doing that. Follow him.\u201d</p><p>So, driving about five miles an hour, Eric followed behind Justin for a few more blocks, then the kid cut across some lawns to get to a very small house in the middle of the block. Justin\u2019s van was in the driveway but another newer car was parked in front. Justin crashed through the front door.</p><p>\u201cI guess we\u2019re here,\u201d Al said.</p><p>Eric parked his Jeep and the two men walked up the driveway to the front door, which still stood open, and what they could see inside was shocking. The small living room was dominated by a hospital bed and Dr. Grant was sitting on the edge of the bed. There was a wheelchair, oxygen tank, other hospital paraphernalia. Dr. Grant had his stethoscope in his ears and was listening to the woman\u2019s heart. Oxygen was being administered and the woman\u2019s eyes were closed. Justin leaned over her from the other side of the bed, panting. He tenderly touched her forehead while two younger boys stood off to the side, worry etched into their features.</p><p>Dr. Grant took his stethoscope out of his ears and looked at Justin. \u201cI\u2019m afraid this is the end of the line, Justin.\u201d</p> <p>Oh, shit, she\u2019s dead! Eric thought.</p><p>Then the doctor continued. \u201cI called for an ambulance. She has to go to the hospital. She\u2019s breathing better now, but she needs close medical supervision.\u201d</p><p>Justin swallowed and said, \u201cThen she comes home, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Justin. You gave it your best shot. Your mother needs a full nursing-care facility. We can try to get her a bed. This is end stage. Her quality of life will be improved in a care facility. And so will yours.\u201d</p><p>Justin gave a short, bitter laugh. \u201cNot for too fucking long!\u201d he barked.</p><p>\u201cI give you my word, I\u2019ll do everything I can to help DHS find you boys a place together. I know right now you think it\u2019s the end of the world, but this can work out. You can\u2019t take on any more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix months, that\u2019s all I need! Six months and I\u2019m eighteen and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust being eighteen doesn\u2019t guarantee you\u2019ll get parental custody of the boys.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t any other family,\u201d Justin said. \u201cIt has to be me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve talked about this. I\u2019m going to step outside and wait for the ambulance while you talk to your brothers. You have to stay calm now, son. Don\u2019t get your mom upset with a lot of emotion. Remember what I told you\u2014you\u2019ll have a little time. This isn\u2019t going to happen overnight.\u201d</p><p>Scott Grant draped the stethoscope around his neck, picked up his bag and stepped past Eric and Al and outside. Eric and Al followed him.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Eric said.</p><p>\u201cJustin\u2019s mother is sick,\u201d Scott said. \u201cShe has MS. She\u2019s had it for a long time and she\u2019s not going to get better. She\u2019s been virtually bedridden for over a year now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Justin takes care of her?\u201d Eric asked.</p><p>\u201cHe takes care of her days and the younger boys keep an eye on her when Justin works, but there\u2019s also home health care. There\u2019s a visiting nurse who looks in on them regularly and I check on her all the time. Justin wants to do the right thing for the family but I think the strain of what this is doing to her sons is also showing on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe takes care of her days,\u201d Eric said. It was not a question.</p><p>Scott nodded.</p><p>\u201cHe dropped out of school. I should\u2019ve known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe just wants to keep the family together, but I think his decision to do that was as hard on Sally as anything. I found him a laptop and we got the GED information downloaded, if he ever has time to concentrate. He wanted to make it to eighteen, gainfully employed, so he could take on the house and his brothers. So they could be together.\u201d</p><p>Eric frowned and shook his head. \u201cHow\u2019s he going to manage all that on a service station attendant\u2019s salary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe family gets help from the Department of Human Services. Food stamps, health care and supplemental income, that sort of thing. It\u2019s not a lot but it keeps body and soul together. But DHS is going to want to take over, get those younger boys placed in foster care. I can stall for a while\u2014Justin and his brothers have been running that house for a long time, they\u2019re capable. If I don\u2019t place Sally in a facility right away, and in fact I might not be able to\u2014it\u2019s all about available space\u2014DHS will have to be patient. But they\u2019ve been ready to pounce for a long time now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you telling me that three young boys are able to stay on their own with an invalid in the house, but they can\u2019t stay alone without all that responsibility and stress?\u201d Al asked Scott.</p><p>\u201cThe invalid mother is not only over twenty-one with a sound mind and their biological parent, there is also a doctor and home health-care nurse on the scene regularly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Justin?\u201d Eric asked.</p><p>Scott shrugged. \u201cThey might give him six months of foster care, but at eighteen, that program closes for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t he tell me?\u201d Eric asked. \u201cI asked him if his mother was sick and he said she was tough. I saw him buying groceries in Bandon and he said he\u2019d taken a day off from school to take her to the doctor. He said she was in a wheelchair and I thought maybe an accident or... Why didn\u2019t he tell me the situation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the same reason he uses his food stamps in Bandon, Eric. He doesn\u2019t want anyone\u2019s pity. He doesn\u2019t even shop for food in town. He\u2019s a proud, strong, devoted young man.\u201d</p><p>Al was scowling. \u201cWhere\u2019s their father?\u201d</p><p>Scott shook his head. \u201cI have no idea. Maybe Justin knows, but he\u2019s pretty bitter about his dad leaving them when his mother was sick. I haven\u2019t had any luck getting that information out of him. And I couldn\u2019t tell you if finding the father would be good for the family or only make things worse.\u201d</p><p>They chatted for a while longer and finally a county ambulance pulled up to the house followed by Mac in the sheriff\u2019s department SUV.</p><p>\u201cNo lights or siren,\u201d Eric observed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s medical transport not an emergency. If you call 911 you get the fire department\u2019s rescue squad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard Justin tell his brother to call 911.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe called me first\u2014I got here fast. He didn\u2019t need rescue. Sally was having trouble breathing but didn\u2019t need resuscitation.\u201d</p><p>Just as he said that a couple of ambulance EMTs with a gurney passed them on the way to the front door. \u201cHey, Doc,\u201d one of them said.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he returned. \u201cI\u2019ll follow you to the hospital, get Sally admitted. She\u2019s stable at the moment but she needs the oxygen. She\u2019s recovering from pneumonia\u2014a complication of her MS. She shouldn\u2019t need an IV until we get her to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. We\u2019ll see you over there.\u201d</p><p>Mac joined them. They all kind of stood around, saying nothing, until the EMTs emerged from the house with a woman still wearing the oxygen cannulas, sitting upright on the gurney.</p><p>Eric looked at Mac. \u201cShe\u2019s not doing very well. She\u2019s being taken to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I heard,\u201d Mac said.</p><p>When Al and Eric got back to the station, everything was fine. Howie was under control, pumping gas like mad. And Al said, \u201cListen, I know it\u2019s your night to bug out early while Justin and I manage things, but I need a couple of hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor?\u201d Eric asked.</p><p>\u201cNone of your business, but I\u2019m not going to rob an armored car or anything that would reflect badly on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going back there,\u201d Eric said.</p><p>\u201cI think someone should and I think it shouldn\u2019t be you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Seriously, I\u2019ve been looking out for the kid since I hired him and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he thinks we have a common enemy\u2014the boss. Let me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the enemy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, but he\u2019s got a bomb inside him. Come on, try to remember how little sense the world made when you were his age\u2014try to remember how many innocent people you thought were plotting against you. He\u2019s a mess. He didn\u2019t ask for the mess, either.\u201d</p><p>Eric thought about that for ten seconds. \u201cYeah. Go. Take all the time you need. We got this. And if you see a chance, tell him I\u2019ll do anything I can to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure I will,\u201d he said. Al grinned. \u201cYou and Howie got the station. Have fun.\u201d</p><p>Al took off before Eric could think of something more to ask or say. He went back to the Coastline, where he\u2019d left his truck, and drove first to the pizza place, ordered two big ones, then returned to Justin\u2019s house. The door was now closed. In fact the place looked sealed up, but the van was still in the drive. He knocked.</p><p>Justin opened the door with a snarl on his face. Oh, man, this was one tough customer.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Justin asked.</p><p>Al shrugged. Okay, he thought, I\u2019m balancing two large pizza boxes on one hand.... \u201cWell, I invited a few friends over to your place for pizza, I hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d Justin started to close the door and Al put his foot in the way. \u201cI want to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>That sneer didn\u2019t go away. \u201cI have food, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut do you have this kind of food? Because I never met a young man in my life who didn\u2019t like pizza. Jesus, can I come in? You\u2019re being such a pain in my ass!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen just go away.\u201d</p><p>Al pushed his way inside. The younger boys were sitting at the table, where there were three glasses of some kind of liquid, no ice. It looked like a meeting had been taking place. He put the pizza boxes on the table. \u201cOne is pepperoni and sausage and some other stuff and the other one is just lots of cheese because I wasn\u2019t sure what would float here. Maybe someone could get me a drink or something? Whatever that is you\u2019re drinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Kool-Aid,\u201d Justin said. \u201cWe were just talking. Then we might head over to the hospital. But I\u2019ll call Eric, tell him I can\u2019t work....\u201d</p><p>\u201cJustin, he\u2019s not expecting you to come back to the station tonight. I think he\u2019s pretty clear you\u2019ve had some crazy stuff going on.\u201d He opened the top box. \u201cKool-Aid is great.\u201d</p><p>Justin sighed. \u201cAl, this here is Danny. He\u2019s fourteen. And this is Kevin. Twelve. Guys, this is Al Michel. The guy I told you about. I work with him.\u201d</p><p>They each said, \u201cHi.\u201d Very quietly.</p><p>Al nodded at them, then opened the two pizza boxes. \u201cDig in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d two quiet voices said.</p><p>And a glass of Kool-Aid was placed before Al by Justin. \u201cSit down, son,\u201d Al said. \u201cI\u2019m not dangerous. And I\u2019m not going to injure your pride, which is about the size of the Pacific Ocean.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>Justin sat down, but no one reached for pizza. Finally Al did, pulling a piece out of the pie and lifting it to his mouth. \u201cFirst, we eat,\u201d he said. \u201cThen we talk.\u201d No one moved. \u201cCome on, boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not that hungry,\u201d Justin said. And once he said that, his younger brothers nearly sat on their hands.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d appreciate it if you\u2019d try to choke down a piece, just to be polite. Justin, take a piece of pizza so your brothers don\u2019t feel so uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>Still, it took him a long moment. Then when he finally lifted a piece and took a bite, his brothers followed suit. And within ten minutes one of the pizzas was nearly gone. Al hid his smile. Not hungry? That would make sense after their mother was taken to the hospital. But it wasn\u2019t the truth; they were growing boys.</p><p>He watched them with appreciation. Good-looking crowd, all of whom could use a decent haircut. Brown hair, brown eyes, straight teeth. Danny was getting a peachy, fuzzy stubble. Kevin wore glasses. Justin was thin, but then he was also tall. Maybe he\u2019d recently shot up a few inches, growing into those big feet.</p><p>Danny sat back first, hands on his stomach. Kevin was next, but he pushed in one more piece first. There were only three pieces left when these boys without much appetite were full. \u201cGet cleaned up while I talk to Justin,\u201d Al said. \u201cThen I\u2019ll take you over to the hospital to see your mother, make sure she\u2019s settled in all right.\u201d</p><p>Danny and Kevin got up from the table but Justin said, \u201cYou have to go back to work.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Eric\u2019s fine. And we\u2019re not going to rush this. Tell me something, Justin\u2014where\u2019s your dad?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged and shook his head. \u201cWe don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen was the last time you talked to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thinking we can just call him up and he\u2019s going to make this right? Listen, he left because he couldn\u2019t stand sickness. It changed his life too much, he said.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t have said that, Al thought. \u201cAnd when was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver five years ago.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe left you here?\u201d</p><p>Justin shook his head. \u201cWe moved here. My mother needed a flat house with handicap stuff. We\u2019ve been here almost three years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were from around here....\u201d</p><p>\u201cElmore, way smaller than this, if you can wrap your brain around that. We were in a two-story. That wasn\u2019t working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, back in Elmore, were there friends? Family\u2014even distant family? Neighbors you\u2019ve known awhile? Anyone we could reach out to now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Justin said impatiently. \u201cWhen people get sick, people are nice, all right? But they don\u2019t want to have to be nice and help out forever. It gets old. My mom needs a lot. I mean a lot! Twenty-four-seven. And two teenage boys...they need stuff, too. They don\u2019t need as much and I can take care of what they need, but no one\u2019s gonna take \u2019em on. And they need me and I\u2019m not gonna be around because no foster family takes a legal adult in, gives him free room and board. Are you getting this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSettle down,\u201d Al said. \u201cEveryone gets it\u2014your situation sucks. But your mom needs more help than three teenage boys can supply. And you boys need a life, too. So\u2014you\u2019re not that much trouble? Know what that tells me? This is your father\u2019s responsibility. He doesn\u2019t even have to do anything\u2014just be the responsible party. Pay the rent, maybe. We just have to track him down....\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to be tracked down! I don\u2019t want him around, but do you think my mom was gonna let that go? She had me look around, see if I could find him. I couldn\u2019t, all right? What I need is to get to eighteen before my mom gives up. Then I can take over. We\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p> <p>Al held his tongue. It was on his mind to say That ship has sailed. If he understood Dr. Grant, no one in this family had any quality of life\u2014not the poor woman who was hanging on when every day of her life from now on was going to be beyond difficult, not the three boys who had spent the last half-dozen years struggling to take care of her and themselves. \u201cMaybe, if we don\u2019t panic, a solution will come to mind,\u201d he said. \u201cFor right now, let\u2019s go see your mom, make sure she\u2019s in good hands. I\u2019ll drive you. Bring you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can take us over....\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me do this, Justin. Concentrate on your family. I won\u2019t interfere or crowd into the hospital room with you. I\u2019ll just be the driver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to go back to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call Eric. He said I should take as much time as I want. He also said he\u2019d be glad to help if he can. I know you hate to ask for help, but try to remember it was offered.\u201d</p><p>Justin told Al about his mother\u2019s disease and he was amazingly articulate. She might live a few more years, might not. She\u2019d been diagnosed a long time ago, when Justin was still little. Sometimes she fell and couldn\u2019t get herself up and he\u2019d come home from school and find she\u2019d been lying on the floor for hours. Or their dad would come home and find her in some trouble and it would get him all crazy because he couldn\u2019t stay home from work. But Justin and his brothers had a routine now\u2014Justin was there for her days and when his brothers came home, he went to work. A nurse came at least four days a week to help her with bathing and such and when the nurse was there, Justin could go out, just for a break or for errands.</p><p>Al waited in the hospital parking lot while the three boys went upstairs to check on their mother. He was curious about what was happening with her, but the boys needed some space right now. Eric wasn\u2019t the only one who saw himself in Justin. So did Al. In fact, Al hadn\u2019t been that much older than Justin when his life had come apart and everything had changed.</p><p>He\u2019d grown up on the farm, had a girlfriend through high school\u2014she was also a farm kid. Her name was Carol and that\u2019s when he was called Mick, short for Michel. They got married at nineteen and lived on his family farm\u2014that was their destiny. They were going to be a farm family and have a slew of kids. Carol could handle all the business and Al could manage the farm. He\u2019d been doing it since he was a kid. Carol got pregnant and had a baby boy\u2014Ethan. And when Ethan was only three months old, he didn\u2019t wake up. Classic crib death\u2014no explanation and no reason to expect it to happen again.</p><p>But Al and Carol were completely devastated. Ripped apart. Al felt like he didn\u2019t take a deep breath for a year. His mother was shattered, his father was in so much pain he barely spoke. Carol\u2019s family, which was larger, was in agony as well and they embraced Carol as best they could. She had a lot of support from them through the worst of it.</p><p>But Al checked out. He ran.</p><p>He was so far from being able to cope, he just made an excuse to get away from the scene of the worst tragedy of his young life. He took a job driving a big rig, a semi, and managed to be gone at least four days a week. He didn\u2019t have any trouble explaining it was a good job, hard to get, and the money would come in handy. While he was gone, Carol had her family to prop her up and she could express her grief to them. Al just wanted to be alone, to lick his wounds, to take an emotional journey to get back to where he was functional. He\u2019d never again be a young man with hope.</p><p>Carol asked him to stop, to come home and work the farm alongside his father, but he was helpless. When he looked into her pretty eyes he felt like he\u2019d failed her in every possible way imaginable. First of all, she\u2019d carried him all through high school, helping him with his school work, tests, everything. She was the only reason he had graduated. Al could barely read. It was another dozen years before he heard the word dyslexia and realized he must be dyslexic, something no one even talked about when he was ten or fifteen years old. Second, she was the only way he could have a farming business. He could manage math in his head pretty well and he had the instincts of a great farmer, but he was hell with reports, articles, printed information, forms. He had spent a lifetime memorizing. You only had to tell him something once; he couldn\u2019t afford to forget anything because he couldn\u2019t look it up. Third, all she ever wanted was a family and he\u2019d given her one only to watch as that precious child had died. Then he watched her collapse as she buried their son. She had been so fragile and he wasn\u2019t strong enough to hold her up. He felt so overwhelmed, he didn\u2019t know what to do.</p><p>After a couple of years his agony settled into a dull ache that left him numb and uncommunicative but feeling as though he could breathe again. He said to Carol, \u201cGood news. I\u2019m quitting the trucking company and coming home to work the farm.\u201d</p><p>And she said, \u201cThat\u2019s great, Mick. But you\u2019re too late to come home to me.\u201d</p><p>She did the only thing she could do\u2014she cut her losses. She said, \u201cI\u2019ll always love you but I can\u2019t depend on you. When everything falls apart and goes to hell, I\u2019ll be alone and you\u2019ll be somewhere else. If you want to suffer alone, I can\u2019t change that about you. But I can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>He argued that for a while\u2014she wasn\u2019t alone. She had a big family\u2014parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, siblings.</p><p>But her husband, the father of her child, had run out on her.</p><p>Carol had done the right thing, he eventually realized. She remarried, had a couple of kids who were healthy and strong and went to college. They were in touch regularly; Carol\u2019s husband tolerated that and was even friendly because good old Mick was no threat. He\u2019d learned to make a good life for himself, solitary though he was. He made sure he was easygoing, generous, a good friend when a friend was needed. But he didn\u2019t get attached because damn, when that went south it hurt like hell. There\u2019d been a woman or two along the way who would\u2019ve liked to settle down, make a family, but he wasn\u2019t up to it. He\u2019d lost his nerve way back.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure anyone realized he was handicapped, that he couldn\u2019t really read much, if at all. He thought maybe the people who were closest to him over the years thought he just wasn\u2019t too bright, which didn\u2019t really upset him.</p><p>He spent a lot of time saying things like, \u201cCan you read this? I forgot my glasses.\u201d Or, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you order the two best things on the menu and we\u2019ll share.\u201d And now that he was fifty-six it was easy: \u201cDo you think that print could be any smaller?\u201d</p><p>There was help out there. He knew that. The problem was that even knowing you have a condition that prevented you from reading, sometimes from learning, it didn\u2019t keep you from feeling like an idiot.</p><p>Here he stood. In a hospital parking lot at dusk. Three young boys upstairs visiting a mother who was on borrowed time. Even if she didn\u2019t pass away, she was pretty much done raising her sons\u2014they were on their own. They had no one but each other.</p><p>Al had wanted sons. If things were different, he could help out here. He liked Eric\u2019s station, liked the town, liked Ray Anne, liked the boys\u2014but who would elect him as a foster parent? He couldn\u2019t help with homework, couldn\u2019t even read their book reports. Hell, he\u2019d probably struggle with reading report cards!</p><p>There was a bench outside the hospital\u2019s front door. He sat down and got out his cell phone. He called his ex-wife. She sounded happy to get a call from him. \u201cMick! How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Good. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll is good,\u201d she said. \u201cTony is better. His kidney function is improved and his doctor is happy. Bless that man, he hates not being able to work right now, but that\u2019s just a man thing. I\u2019m working and everyone in the family is healthy. Where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOregon,\u201d he said. \u201cEric sold his business in Eugene and opened up a new one on the coast. It\u2019s a small town, small station, very friendly. How are your kids?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cFine.

Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, fine. Well, I\u2019m waiting out in front of a hospital right now. One of the young kids I work with, his mother has MS and is real sick. The ambulance took her to the hospital and I brought the kid and his younger brothers to see her. Seems like they\u2019re pretty much on their own. I\u2019m just waiting here to take them home. Nothing I can do about this, but it\u2019s too bad. You know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cYou always were tender-hearted.\u201d</p><p>Except with you, he wanted to say. He just wasn\u2019t there for her. He regretted that but you can only regret the agonies of youth for so long. He just hadn\u2019t been emotionally equipped to do any better. \u201cI\u2019ll lend a hand if I can, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be here much longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen will we see you next?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cSummer,\u201d he said. She knew exactly when he\u2019d be in Boone, but she didn\u2019t say that and she never made him say it. \u201cI don\u2019t go that way in winter, you know that. But I\u2019ll see you in the summer. Is there anything you need in the meantime?\u201d</p><p>She answered him with a small laugh. \u201cI have everything I need. What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t something important coming up? Birthday or anniversary or something?\u201d He knew exactly what was coming up\u2014her fifty-sixth birthday in May, sometimes it fell on Mother\u2019s Day. It had when she was pregnant with Ethan. He bought her a fancy rocking chair and she made such a fuss over it.</p><p>\u201cAnother birthday,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Well. Listen, those boys will be coming out in a minute so I\u2019d better get off the phone. I\u2019ll...ah...give you a call before I head that way so maybe we can get together for a cup of coffee. Or something like that...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be nice, Mick. Now you be careful out there on the road. Be careful on your way back home.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou take care, too. Hope Tony keeps feeling better.\u201d</p><p>Tony wasn\u2019t exactly sick, but he had some kind of kidney problem that Carol described as not too serious. He was sixty and not as lucky with his health as Al was\u2014he\u2019d been forced to stop farming for the time being at least. Probably those god-awful winters...</p><p>Al would see Carol like he did every year. On July twelfth. Ethan\u2019s birthday.</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>Al got the boys back home after 9:00 p.m., considerably later than he expected. By that time Eric told him to quit for the day, get himself a cold beer or something. There was a spring storm rolling in over the bay and if there was lightning, he might be shutting the pumps down anyway.</p><p>Al had a couple of beers in that little refrigerator in his motel room, but the night called for something different. He was still in his uniform but hadn\u2019t had time to get dirty at work yet. It was getting late when he knocked on Ray Anne\u2019s front door. She opened it without asking who was there. She had a rag of some kind tied around her hair, a green, gooey mask on her face, cotton balls between her toes and was wearing cutoff sweatpants and a baggy T-shirt. \u201cWhoa,\u201d he said, taking a step back.</p><p>She put a hand on her hip. \u201cI see. You thought I was naturally beautiful....\u201d</p><p>He lifted his brows. \u201cWell, hell, you sure come out looking real good.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid we have plans?\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his jaw. \u201cNah. I just had one of those days and was looking for a beer. I can find one somewhere else. I\u2019m obviously interrupting something very important....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou scared to come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say so, no.\u201d He peered at her closely, squinting. \u201cDoes that do anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt makes my pores small and my wrinkles smaller. You can come in. It\u2019s ripe. I can take it off now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot on my account,\u201d he said, smothering a laugh.</p><p>\u201cGet yourself a beer. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d And she turned and left him standing in the open doorway.</p><p>He got himself a beer from her refrigerator and sat on the couch. A few minutes later she returned to the living room in different clothes, her blond hair fluffed up, eyebrows drawn on and a little lipstick. There was still a little green stuff stuck at her temples. \u201cWow. What a transformation,\u201d he said.</p><p>She went to the kitchen; he heard a cork pop. While she was in there, she said, \u201cI can only assume you now plan to marry me.\u201d She came back with her wine. \u201cNow that we\u2019ve been intimate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRay Anne, we were intimate before.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cThat was sex,\u201d she explained. \u201cSeeing me in the throes of preconstruction\u2014that\u2019s intimate.\u201d</p><p>He touched his temple. \u201cYou got a little...\u201d Her hand went there immediately, scraping it away. \u201cWho knew you had to go to so much trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll appreciate me more now, I bet.\u201d She sipped her wine.</p><p>\u201cI apologize. I should\u2019ve called. It was just a shot in the dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiterally,\u201d she said. \u201cNow what has you knocking on doors at ten at night? Don\u2019t you work late tonight?\u201d</p><p>He started to tell her about the Russell boys but found he didn\u2019t want to go into too much detail. It brought his own conflicted feelings out when he thought about how intensely screwed up their little lives were. He just gave her the bare facts\u2014Mrs. Russell went to the hospital, Al drove the boys to see her, make sure she was all right, by the time he took them home it was late and Eric had the station covered. The pumps might be shutting down on account of lightning anyway....</p><p>\u201cI heard some rumbling out there,\u201d Ray Anne said. \u201cWhen you live around here you soon learn the best thing is the sunset over the bay. The second best are the storms. The lightning over the bay.\u201d She closed her eyes and smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s spectacular.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could drive down to the marina in the truck. Grab your wine,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to go that far,\u201d she said. \u201cI have a deck on top of the garage. There\u2019s a view from there. I can\u2019t see the whole bay but I can see the sky over the bay and one of the haystack rocks in the water. Wanna go up?\u201d</p><p>His eyes lit up. \u201cI wanna go up,\u201d he said.</p><p>She grinned at him. \u201cLet me grab this,\u201d she said, pulling the throw off the sofa and tossing it over a shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s still cold out there at night. Come with me. This way.\u201d</p><p>She led him through the kitchen, out the door and into the garage. \u201cGrab a beanbag,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll get one, too.\u201d Then out the back door into the yard where there was a narrow staircase to the roof. \u201cI\u2019ll hold your beer while you toss these beanbags up there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever thought about a couple of lawn chairs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re new in town.\u201d She laughed. \u201cThey\u2019d blow off.\u201d</p><p>It only took a minute to get situated up there. Just as they were getting comfortable reclining against the beanbags, lightning over the mouth of the bay started flashing. The wind picked up a little bit and Ray Anne snuggled under the throw and against him. She held her wine, he held his beer and his arm pulled her closer.</p><p>\u201cI love this,\u201d he said. \u201cI wonder if I can get on top at the Coastline....\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him.</p><p>He leaned toward her, nuzzling her neck. \u201cHow many lovers have you brought up here?\u201d</p><p>She chuckled. \u201cToo many to count.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Take a stab at it. How many?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI haven\u2019t been in this house that long. Just a few years. And I was convinced to buy it when I found out I could put this deck up here. It\u2019s kind of a special place. It\u2019s kind of a secret place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many?\u201d he persisted.</p><p>\u201cOkay, none. All right? It\u2019s all mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever slept up here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. I\u2019ve fallen asleep up here a couple of times, just watching the sky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen the weather gets warm we\u2019re going to make love up here,\u201d he said. \u201cThen we\u2019re going to sleep for a while and make love again. This is a great secret to have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t said I\u2019d do that with you,\u201d she informed him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to because you said you were going to make me marry you. For, you know, seeing what you do to your face to be beautiful. It\u2019s incredible. Horrific, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never getting married again,\u201d Ray Anne said.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he chuckled, kissing her ear. \u201cWe\u2019ll just have sex on the roof and sleep under the stars. This is great up here. You\u2019re brilliant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you ever tell anyone about my preconstruction face I\u2019ll sue you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRay Anne, do you think you\u2019re not pretty? You\u2019re beautiful. And I\u2019ve seen you in the early morning without any makeup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? Of course I have.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cWhen you stay over, I don\u2019t remove my makeup before bed and when I slip in the bathroom to freshen up, I freshen up\u2014repair the damage, renew the lip gloss, fluff the hair. When I\u2019m alone for the night, I put green stuff on my face and then I lather up in moisturizer, fighting back time. I color my hair....\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you gray?\u201d he asked. He didn\u2019t have that much gray for a man his age.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Santa Claus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d he asked with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cThat goes no further....\u201d</p><p>He brushed her hair off her forehead. \u201cYou know, you don\u2019t have to go to all that trouble for me\u2014the fluffing, repairing, glossing. You can grease up if you want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you like the way I look....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he said. \u201cYou look damn good. It makes me look good, taking you out to a restaurant. Hell, it makes me look good buying you a soda at the station! But when we\u2019re alone, if you want to put on all your lotions, I can go along with that. In fact, I bet all that lotion comes in handy.\u201d He leaned over and kissed her. \u201cYou\u2019re a pretty little thing, Ray Anne. But you know what I like best? The way you flirt with me, come on to me, tease me a little bit. And I like your personality\u2014you\u2019re smart. Funny. A little dirty...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDirty?\u201d</p><p>He laughed at her. \u201cI mean that in a good way. You don\u2019t have too many inhibitions when we\u2019re alone. I like that. But you know what I like best? I like that you can put me in a better frame of mind. I can be worried or unhappy and the minute I\u2019m in your company, I feel better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t seem like a guy who ever gets unhappy or stressed,\u201d she said.</p><p>He pulled her a little closer. \u201cAh, hell, honey. Under all this perfection, I\u2019m just a regular guy.\u201d</p><p>With the storm building and lightning flashing over the ocean Eric sent Howie home at nine and closed the station a little early. He went home to shower off the day and when he emerged from the bathroom, towel wrapped around his waist, he found Laine sitting on the bed beside a tray. He grinned and rubbed a small towel over his hair. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late for a big meal, but I know you didn\u2019t eat....\u201d</p><p>On the tray was a small artichoke dip and crackers, some sliced meat and cheese, a bunch of grapes, a round of brie. His stomach growled. \u201cI\u2019ll be right with you.\u201d He ditched the towel in favor of sweats and came back to the bed. He noticed she had an open bottle of wine and two glasses on the bedside table, but there was also a tall glass with ice and a Coke. His choice.</p><p>\u201cPour me a little of that wine, will you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cWalking on the wild side tonight?\u201d she asked. She poured a small amount into a glass and handed it to him.</p><p>\u201cNot very wild\u2014I have the tow business tonight. This looks awesome.\u201d He ran a cracker through the dip and chased it with a sip of red wine.</p> <p>\u201cMy food preparation really lights your fire. I think in an earlier life you liked to drag your woolly mammoth home to the cave for your woman to butcher and roast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then she tanned the hide and made me pants.\u201d He chewed a couple of grapes. \u201cWhat have you been doing tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMostly watching the show,\u201d she said, pointing her wine toward the sliding glass doors. \u201cIt\u2019s the first really good one since I moved here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it gets better and more frequent through summer,\u201d he told her. \u201cWe\u2019re going to spend a lot of time on the deck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd in bed,\u201d she said, taking a grape and sip of wine.</p> <p>\u201cStorms or not,\u201d he said.</p><p>They leaned back against the pillows and headboard of the bed, tray between them, and watched the fury over the bay. Sometimes, when the lightning was close, the noise was so deafening they both jumped in surprise. When the lightning struck one of the big rocks in the bay, they shouted in excitement as if they were kids at a fireworks display.</p><p>And then the rain began in earnest and Laine moved the tray, put her wineglass on the bedside table and curled up against him. The lightning became flashes behind clouds while the wind blew the rain against the windows.</p><p>\u201cIf you had told me five years ago that one day I\u2019d have this kind of life, I never would have believed it,\u201d Eric said.</p><p>\u201cYou mean \u2018stable\u2019?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOnce I got prison out of the way, stability became my middle name. It was a priority. I didn\u2019t make too many fast moves\u2014I liked the no-drama zone a lot. But I was sometimes overworked and pretty often bored. No, I didn\u2019t know I\u2019d be working on my second business, that I\u2019d be a father to a wonderful girl, that I\u2019d be laying in bed with the most incredible woman I\u2019ve ever met....\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, does it come as any surprise that I didn\u2019t see you in my astrological charts, either? I thought I\u2019d spend half my life investigating, establishing probable cause, and the other half undercover or in court. And then there\u2019s the paperwork...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this life getting too dull for you?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThis is the best I\u2019ve felt since my mom passed away. I wish I\u2019d had my aura read or something\u2014I bet it was spikey and black and nervous before.\u201d She turned her head and looked up at him. \u201cI bet it\u2019s all soft pink and lavender now. I was all about controlling the stress before. I think you sucked the stress right out of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou and a couple of other things. Some healthy distance from Senior helped. A second look at the commune, disarmed. And I don\u2019t know what\u2019s different about this place but the people are... They\u2019re nice. They let me in. I didn\u2019t realize how few women I had in my life. Well, I realized it, but I didn\u2019t know I could do anything about it. I didn\u2019t know what kind of friendship I was missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere there just men in your life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot what you think. I worked with mostly men and the women I had grown close to were more mentors than girlfriends. I don\u2019t have to prove myself to these people, to these women, and it\u2019s different. I can tell you something that might scare you to death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve learned to be very brave where you\u2019re concerned....\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to resign from the FBI this week. I like my new life. I like being here, being with you. I\u2019ve gotten a little lazy....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat last assignment took a lot out of you,\u201d he said. \u201cAnother few months like this and you could be ready for your edgy life again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I\u2019m not?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAnd what if I\u2019m not enough?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cEric, you\u2019re not under any pressure, please believe that. My expectations of you are the same as they\u2019ve been from the start\u2014just having you in my life is enough.\u201d</p><p>He slid an arm around her and pulled her on top of him. She was stretched out over the length of him. He pulled her mouth onto his while thunder rumbled over them. He kissed her deeply. When he let her go he said, \u201cDon\u2019t tease me. You know you\u2019re all I want.\u201d</p><p>When the rain was driving inland over the bay, Hank Cooper grabbed his rain slicker and flashlight and went outside through the back door of the bar. He crossed the parking lot and shone the light on the path that would soon be a stone sidewalk. He braced a foot on the raised floor of the structure that would be his house and pulled himself up and inside. He pointed the flashlight toward the large open room in the front of the house. Sarah sat on a stack of two paint cans, looking out the glassless window at the storm. Her growing middle seemed to be precariously balanced over her thighs.</p><p>\u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t prowl around over here in the dark,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to check out the storm, see what we\u2019d see from the great room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSarah, what if you tripped over construction debris and fell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d bounce,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me you didn\u2019t lift a full paint can to stack those....\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou did!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been instructed not to tell you....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a wiseass,\u201d he accused. He took off the slicker and draped it around her shoulders. \u201cCome on. I\u2019ll light the way. And step carefully\u2014it\u2019s wet and muddy out there.\u201d He put an arm around her waist, what there was of it, and led the way. He jumped down first and reached up for her, lifting her down, his arm staying around her.</p><p>\u201cIf you slip and fall, you\u2019ll take me with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m as sure-footed as a mountain goat,\u201d he said, then slipped. He righted himself before he could do any damage. He got her inside and hung the slicker on a peg by the back door. \u201cYou feeling all right, babe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel amazing. I wish the house was done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother six to eight weeks,\u201d he said, running a hand over her pregnant belly. \u201cBefore she comes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish it could be done in time for a graduation party for Landon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have a great party right here. We have the deck and the beach. It\u2019ll be good, don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>Landon appeared in the doorway to the kitchen, mop in hand. \u201cDid I hear my name?\u201d Then he looked at the floor beneath their feet. \u201cAw, man. I just mopped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe nice,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cWe\u2019re planning your graduation party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCash money would be better,\u201d he said with a grin.</p><p>\u201cI think the University of Oregon is going to get the cash money,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cYou\u2019re getting a party. And a new niece.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, could you please move my sister and niece over so I can mop up that puddle you brought in?\u201d</p><p>Cooper scooted Sarah over onto the rug inside the door. \u201cHey, Landon, you know a kid named Justin Russell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe went to your high school, but I take it he dropped out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah? Oh, wait, he\u2019s that kid who pumps gas at Lucky\u2019s, right? He hardly ever says two words. So, what\u2019s up with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I stopped to get gas tonight, Eric mentioned the kid\u2019s mother was taken to the hospital in an ambulance and there\u2019s no dad in the family. The kid\u2019s mom is an invalid. Justin seems to be taking care of his younger brothers. By himself.\u201d</p><p>Landon whistled. \u201cI hope he can manage as well as Sarah did, raising me alone. That can\u2019t be easy. Poor guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if you talk to him, like when you\u2019re getting gas or something, you might ask him if there\u2019s anything we can do to help. If you mention about being raised by your sister...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do that, Cooper, but I\u2019m telling you\u2014that kid doesn\u2019t want to talk.\u201d Landon gave the mop a swipe across the floor. \u201cHe probably doesn\u2019t know what hit him. I\u2019ll be sure to say hi. Or something...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes it doesn\u2019t take much,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cYou know\u2014just reach out. Sometimes all a guy needs is a chance.\u201d</p><p>The rumble of thunder and the rain against the window woke Sally Russell and she stirred in the hospital bed. She hadn\u2019t been asleep very long\u2014respiratory therapy kept waking her. This time when she opened her eyes she saw her son sitting in the chair beside her bed. \u201cJustin?\u201d she asked sleepily.</p><p>He stood up and came to the bedside. \u201cHi, Mom. How do you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy chest hurts, but I think it\u2019s getting better. I\u2019m doing that breathing machine every couple of hours, at least. And I have antibiotics in the IV. Why are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got the boys home and came back. In case you need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need you, honey. There are nurses....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, in case you\u2019re upset or worried. You know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. I don\u2019t want you to sit in that chair all night. You need to get home, get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go in a while,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the rain lets up some. I just wanted to make sure you\u2019re doing okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou spoil me,\u201d she said. Her voice was a whisper punctuated by attempts to take deep breaths. Justin had to lean close to hear her. \u201cWe have to be realistic, honey. You and the boys can\u2019t take care of me anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re okay, Mom. Really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019d do anything for me, I know. I want you to talk to Dr. Grant about what we do next. As a family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe the nurse can come more often. If the nurse can come more often...\u201d</p><p>She was shaking her head. \u201cI\u2019m tired now, honey,\u201d she whispered. \u201cMaybe tomorrow we can talk more about this. I want you to go home. Get some rest.\u201d</p><p>He leaned over and kissed her forehead. \u201cI\u2019ll just sit here for a few minutes. Until you fall asleep.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and let her eyes close and he held her hand, but backed away to sit in the chair.</p><p>She was giving up.</p><p>Justin couldn\u2019t remember a time they hadn\u2019t lived with MS. It wasn\u2019t long after his youngest brother was born that it was confirmed\u2014her symptoms were related to MS; her muscle weakness and spasms, her lack of coordination and tremors, slurring speech. Then her vision became so bad if she didn\u2019t fall because of her clumsiness, she might trip or miscalculate a step. From that first diagnosis until she needed almost full-time help was only a few years. Justin was doing more to help and take care of the family than anyone else by the time his father couldn\u2019t take it anymore.</p><p>\u201cYou had to grow up too fast because of me,\u201d his mother frequently said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, Mom,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>When he was sure she was sleeping soundly, he quietly left the room. He was walking down the hall when he ran into Dr. Grant.</p><p>\u201cJust the man I wanted to see,\u201d Scott Grant said. \u201cI was going to catch up with you tomorrow in Thunder Point, but this is good. You came over to visit your mom?\u201d</p><p>Justin nodded. Silent. He didn\u2019t trust his voice at the moment.</p><p>Scott Grant put a hand on Justin\u2019s shoulder. \u201cCome on. I\u2019ll walk out with you. I can keep your mom for a few days, maybe a week. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to have to do\u2014her name is on a list for extended nursing care. They expect a bed in a week at the earliest, a month at the longest. If your mom goes home again, Justin, it\u2019s going to be the last time. She needs full-time nursing care and therapy. She\u2019ll have more time if she gets what she needs.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cWe can give her anything she needs,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re damn good at taking care of her, son. I\u2019m impressed by the quality of care she gets at home but we both knew it had limits. Not only does your mom deserve a better quality of life, but so do you and your brothers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the thing, Doc. If she goes into the nursing home, are they going to let me take on the house and the boys? No, they\u2019re not, that\u2019s what. They\u2019re going to go to foster homes, maybe different ones. They might even make me go for a few months and then what happens to the house? I can tell you right now, that\u2019s not happening. I can take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJustin, don\u2019t concentrate on worst-case scenarios\u2014we might find a foster family right in Thunder Point. Aside from the boys sleeping in another family\u2019s house, there won\u2019t be that much different about your lives. Except they won\u2019t have to work so hard to keep things together at home. Now, let\u2019s talk about your dad....\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone, Doc. He left about six years ago. They\u2019ve been divorced for five years. He sent money for a couple of years but we haven\u2019t seen a check in a long time. I don\u2019t know where he is....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere was he last?\u201d Scott asked.</p><p>\u201cI think, Portland. And we\u2019re not going to Portland!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt might keep the three of you together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWherever the boys end up, I\u2019ll go there and get work. But not with him. You think he\u2019s a solution? The guy who took off and left three little kids alone with a sick mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be the last guy to nominate him for father of the year,\u201d Scott said. \u201cI\u2019m going to get to work on this right away, son. I\u2019ve been asking questions and making phone calls, but now it\u2019s time to take some action. We\u2019re going to find a solution to this that works for you and your brothers. Try not to worry too much.\u201d</p><p>Justin gave a huff of laughter. \u201cRight. Well, worry seems to be what I do best.\u201d</p><p>Fifteen</p><p>Laine couldn\u2019t believe how satisfying and tranquil her life had become.</p> <p>The few cases she managed were simple and left plenty of time for her to work out at the dojo, to enjoy her deck in the warming spring weather, make good use of her kitchen and best of all, have quality time with Eric. And then the one thing that could completely derail her happened. The doorbell rang in late afternoon. She opened it to stare into the eyes of her father.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d she said. She was momentarily paralyzed.</p><p>\u201cAre we just going to stand here and stare at each other?\u201d Senior said.</p><p>She stepped back so he could enter. \u201cHow did you find me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe way any intelligent person would. I hired someone to find you. I knew approximately where you were even though you\u2019ve done your best to remove me from your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t the person you hired have found you a phone number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy bother with that? You wouldn\u2019t talk to me. Let\u2019s not make this harder than it already is\u2014I\u2019m here to make amends. I need my children back in my life. You\u2019re all I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have Pax, the one you find acceptable.\u201d</p> <p>He frowned, his dark brows lowering. \u201cPax has his own family and his fellowship, I have very little of him. Except that he\u2019s checking on me all the time now. But he doesn\u2019t ask me what\u2019s going on with me\u2014he asks the help. But Pax will at least talk to me.\u201d</p><p>They stood in the foyer. He glanced around, lifting a dark eyebrow as he peered into the study, where her desk and computer sat. He was such a big man, so full of bluster and stubbornness, she crossed her arms protectively over her chest. \u201cThere were terms,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cI told you I didn\u2019t want to hear from you until we made some changes in our relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we sit down?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe need to get this put to bed.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI was clear. You were clearly stubborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want from me, Laine? Want me to say I\u2019m sorry?\u201d he asked. His voice boomed as usual. His physique matched his voice\u2014he was robust, fit, tanned as though he\u2019d been on vacation. He\u2019d been bald forever, as long as she could remember, with a dark ring of hair around his dome. He was a handsome man. Her mother used to say he looked just like Trapper John, M.D., possibly accounting for the many reruns of that series they watched when Laine was a little girl. For a seventy-year-old man his belly was surprisingly flat, his arms well-muscled, legs straight. He didn\u2019t look his age. \u201cNow can we sit and talk?\u201d</p><p>She gave a singular nod and turned, walking into the house, into the kitchen. As she passed the table she pulled out a chair for him, giving another nod toward it. \u201cWhat would you like to drink? Tea? Wine? Cola?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoffee?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll brew a pot.\u201d</p><p>She got busy in the kitchen while he sat at the table, taking in the view. \u201cWell, this isn\u2019t bad,\u201d he said. \u201cI can see why you were drawn to it. But it\u2019s not as though we don\u2019t have views back East. This place has nothing on Cape Cod, the Hamptons, Kennebunkport, Newport...\u201d</p><p>She loved the unique and exquisite view but now she knew that\u2019s not why she\u2019d come to Thunder Point. \u201cI don\u2019t live alone here,\u201d she said. She set the coffee to brew and opened a bottle of wine. She felt a sudden temptation to take a few gulps from the bottle, but she poured herself a small glass. She went to the table and sat across from him. \u201cI live with a man. I\u2019ve lived with him for almost three months. His name is Eric.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what does he do?\u201d Senior asked.</p><p>She tilted her head and leveled her gaze at his piercing blue eyes. Of course her father didn\u2019t ask if he was a good man, if he was kind or intelligent or funny or generous. He didn\u2019t wonder if he had integrity. \u201cHe owns a gas station.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA gas station?\u201d he asked with a short laugh. \u201cWell, you must like him.\u201d</p><p>She leaned toward him. \u201cI don\u2019t need his rent money. I\u2019m never lonely, especially when I\u2019m alone. I\u2019m not needy. I\u2019m not scared. I don\u2019t need anyone to take care of me. Of course I like him.\u201d</p><p>He smiled slightly. \u201cAh, so he\u2019s brave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re a terrifying woman.\u201d</p><p>Impatient, she leaned back in her chair and even though she was sitting, her hands went to her hips. \u201cIs this about the FBI again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ve been warned about that,\u201d he said, holding up his hands with palms toward her. \u201cBut I got to thinking\u2014we should put all that to rest for your mother\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit late for that. Mom is finally free of our conflicted relationship,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd she always supported my choices.\u201d She got up and went to the cupboard, retrieving a mug. She poured him some coffee. Then she put cream and sugar on the table with a spoon. She glanced at the clock\u2014five-fifteen. While Senior dressed his coffee, she pulled her phone into her lap, hidden, and texted Eric: My father is here!</p><p>He texted back right away. Do you need me?</p><p>See you at six? she texted back and he replied immediately, I\u2019ll be there.</p><p>\u201cEric will be home around six,\u201d she told her father. \u201cI was busy most of the day so I didn\u2019t cook. Where are you staying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaine,\u201d he grumbled. \u201cAm I not welcome here? Don\u2019t you have a guest room?\u201d</p><p>She took a sip of her wine. \u201cHere\u2019s the deal, Dad. The last time we were together for more than twenty-four hours we got into a shouting match and it all started when I told you I was getting a commendation from the FBI and you belittled me. You said you\u2019d much rather have a daughter without a bullet in her shoulder than any kind of award\u2014you said I was a huge disappointment to you. You said you didn\u2019t want to hear another word about it and you said you wouldn\u2019t celebrate it.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his chin defiantly.</p><p>\u201cAnd do you remember what I said?\u201d she continued.</p><p>\u201cThat I owed you an apology, which I offered before sitting at your table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t. You asked if I wanted one and the answer is still the same. Yes, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Consider this an apology. What else?\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cAre you joking or just trying to be difficult? That wasn\u2019t an apology! You have to change your attitude! You\u2019ve been critical of every choice I\u2019ve made since I was seventeen and I\u2019m done. Do you hear me, Dad? Because I\u2019m serious about this\u2014there\u2019s no point in us having a relationship if it\u2019s going to be toxic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what you want, Laine!\u201d</p><p>He was unbelievable. \u201cI want you to be proud of me when I accomplish something I worked hard at but if that\u2019s not possible I at least insist you not criticize my efforts. Otherwise, we don\u2019t have a relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll do that. Can we be at peace on this? For once?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstand something, Dad\u2014I\u2019m serious about this. This is the last time I quarrel with you about how I choose to live my life. It\u2019s not as though I\u2019m making bad choices. I\u2019m not doing anything wrong, I\u2019m doing something right. I\u2019m doing something very difficult and admirable, something very few can do and I am tired of the tension between us. If you can\u2019t show me respect, I don\u2019t want you in my life.\u201d And what she couldn\u2019t put into words\u2014he was the only man who could hurt her! Why that was, she couldn\u2019t understand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your father,\u201d he said. \u201cI want us to get along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s entirely up to you,\u201d she told him. \u201cI don\u2019t criticize you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but you do. You call me narrow-minded, toxic, critical and last I heard, a selfish ass with...what was that you said...?\u201d</p><p>She chewed her lip briefly. She remembered perfectly\u2014she said he had a highly developed sense of entitlement, but she wasn\u2019t about to help him remember. \u201cBecause of the way you treat me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTreat you how? We exchanged words maybe, I don\u2019t even remember the circumstances. Show me a family that doesn\u2019t disagree sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you can\u2019t remember it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I won\u2019t argue with you again. You obviously take my opinions too personally. You know, Laine, some people are sensitive and some are just plain touchy.\u201d</p><p>She sat back in her chair. \u201cYou don\u2019t even know you do it, do you? You never say a positive thing! Now I\u2019m touchy because I was hurt by your insulting remarks! You know, some people are opinionated and some are just rude and cruel!\u201d</p><p>Laine tried to calm herself. It wasn\u2019t as if Senior had never apologized, though it wasn\u2019t often. He could be charming when he put his mind to it. Her mother had adored him; his nurses and techs loved him; his patients worshipped him. But pretending not to remember a blowout that was pivotal in their relationship? He was a giant ass, that\u2019s all.</p><p>\u201cYou know how I feel about you, Laine. I\u2019m your father, of course I love you. I\u2019ve always been proud of you. I\u2019m proud of everything you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t ever say that,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou took first place in the King Oak dressage competition. I filmed the whole event. We watched it together repeatedly. We celebrated! That\u2019s a father\u2019s pride, right there!\u201d</p><p>She gave her head a slight shake, narrowing her eyes. Her mouth stood open slightly. She hadn\u2019t ridden in competition in over fifteen years. The event he mentioned was almost twenty years ago in Massachusetts. Was he kidding? She was just about to light into him for using a twenty-year-old example in an argument proving he was devoted when\u2014 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>She heard the front door open. Eric must have been concerned about her. He was early. When he walked into the kitchen Senior stood up. \u201cWho is this?\u201d her father asked.</p><p>\u201cDad, this is Eric Gentry.\u201d</p> <p>Senior put out his hand. \u201cDr. Carrington,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cFirst names, Dad,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cPaxton Carrington,\u201d he corrected. \u201cHow do you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPleasure, sir,\u201d Eric said.</p><p>\u201cI brewed coffee, Eric.\u201d Cell phone in her hand, Laine said, \u201cWould you like to visit with my father for a minute? I need to be excused, but I won\u2019t be long.\u201d</p> <p>Eric gave her a half smile and knowing look. He didn\u2019t have to be a detective to figure this out\u2014she had a death grip on her phone. Then he moved toward the coffeepot. \u201cTake your time. We\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Laine bolted for the stairs and closed herself into her bedroom. She hit the speed dial for Pax and for once he actually answered. \u201cHe\u2019s here!\u201d she blurted. \u201cWhat the hell is Senior doing here?\u201d</p><p>Pax wasn\u2019t just surprised. He actually stuttered a little. \u201cHuh? What? What are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSenior is here! My doorbell rang, I opened the door and there he stood, filling up the frame with his confidence and stubbornness! You couldn\u2019t warn me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaine, you can\u2019t think I knew and didn\u2019t call you! I thought he was in town. I talked to him last week. In fact, he was supposed to go to San Francisco for a conference\u2014he was a presenter. He was a no-show and they were looking for him. He said he changed his mind about going, said he notified them and it was their screwup, but he never said a thing about Oregon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe changed his mind and didn\u2019t tell you? He planned a trip to Thunder Point without telling anyone? That isn\u2019t like him. Did you talk to Mrs. Mulligrew like I suggested?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe said she hadn\u2019t noticed anything other than him being preoccupied sometimes. If he\u2019s home he stays in his office, but he\u2019s not usually home when she\u2019s there. He kept lots of drugs, mostly samples, in his office, but mostly for use in orthopedics. Sometimes he forgot to leave her a check, but if she reminded him or left him a note, it was there the next time. What\u2019s he doing there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he wants to put our problems to rest. But his next sentence was insulting! \u2018You know some people are sensitive and some are just plain touchy\u2019!\u201d she said, mimicking him. \u201cNo wonder I want to smack him upside the head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long is he staying?\u201d Pax asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not staying here! No way! He wasn\u2019t invited. He must have a rental car, though I didn\u2019t look outside. There\u2019s a motel in town, far beneath his standards I\u2019m sure, but he\u2019s not staying here! He hasn\u2019t done anything to put this situation to rest!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, man,\u201d Pax groaned. \u201cI\u2019m so glad I\u2019m not there....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat am I supposed to do with him? I don\u2019t want yet another big fight with him. I\u2019m just not that person right now! I want peace! I\u2019ve earned it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, can you leave town?\u201d Pax asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Laine. Tell him his timing was bad and you were just headed to Switzerland for a month at a spa and you\u2019ll be in touch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re funny. What would Genevieve do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. She\u2019d give him a cup of tea, listen to him without responding or find a benign topic, offer him food and nod politely. Escape to her mother\u2019s or sister\u2019s whenever she could, vent to them and take long baths until he left and then complain to me for weeks afterward about what an impossible load he is. She wouldn\u2019t engage him. I don\u2019t engage him. It\u2019s like rams locking horns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do that,\u201d Laine said. \u201cYeah, I can do that. Maybe. But he has to go to a motel.\u201d</p><p>Pax laughed at her. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that. You\u2019re too much like him. You like being right and you have to point it out to him when he insults you, which only causes him to talk down to you again. I mean, you are right, but you like it too much. You can\u2019t not hear him, you can\u2019t let it go when he offends you, you can\u2019t go to a Zen place....\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right...but I\u2019m good at long baths.... I\u2019d better get downstairs. I left him with Eric....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to meet this guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might be meeting him soon, when you come out here to get your father!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me when he leaves tonight. If you let him live.\u201d</p><p>When she got to the bottom of the stairs she heard laughter. Her father was laughing and talking. Eric was laughing with him.</p><p>\u201cI guess you two found something to talk about?\u201d she ventured.</p><p>\u201cThis fella here has worked on Packards. We had a \u201941 Packard station wagon. You know the kind, with the wood paneling. We had one when I was a kid\u2014it was red. My parents would load us into it and take us to the lake in New York in summer. That car was a beauty. Business was so good my dad got himself a Packard coupe convertible, a \u201949\u2014it was a slick shiny brown. A little cold inside in Boston winters but he didn\u2019t care. He gave my mom the station wagon for the kids and he owned that convertible. What a car. What a car. I loved that convertible.\u201d</p><p>Eric gave her a reassuring smile. Why can\u2019t I do that? she asked herself. Why can\u2019t I just let his snide comments go and talk about classic Packards? \u201cHow old were you?\u201d she asked her dad. Trying. She was trying.</p><p>\u201cOh, nine or ten or something. It was a big deal in my neighborhood, let me tell you. All the kids wanted a ride in it. My oldest brother borrowed it for a dance and dinged it up.\u201d He laughed, shaking his head. \u201cI never heard a bigger uproar in my house. Back then it took weeks to fix something like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow we can do it in an afternoon if we have the right parts. Sometimes we need a second afternoon for paint unless it\u2019s chrome,\u201d Eric said. \u201cYou hungry, Paxton?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Senior leaned back and rubbed his belly. \u201cI could eat. Sorry, son, I missed the name....\u201d</p><p>\u201cEric, sir. Why don\u2019t I take you and Laine to dinner. There\u2019s a nice little seafood place at the marina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon, I\u2019m from Boston. I hope you don\u2019t intend to try to impress me with seafood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir. I\u2019m going to wow you with the company.\u201d</p><p>Paxton laughed pleasantly. \u201cGood for you! Good for you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a few minutes to change clothes and then we\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Absolutely. Don\u2019t want to go out to dinner in your mechanic\u2019s clothes....\u201d</p><p>Laine frowned but Eric touched her arm gently and she relaxed.</p><p>\u201cJanice, where did you find that delightful young man who knows all about classic cars?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaine, Dad,\u201d she corrected.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou called me Janice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm? Did I? You do look so much like your mother sometimes. So where are we going to dinner?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated for a moment, then said, \u201cA seafood restaurant at the marina. It\u2019s not real fancy but the nicest one in town and the food is wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d he said. \u201cThat young man, he\u2019s a friend of yours?\u201d</p><p>Again she was speechless. \u201cI live with him,\u201d she said patiently. \u201cEric is my boyfriend. We\u2019ve lived together for almost three months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe seems a perfectly nice young man. Does he remind you of Pax at all?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNot at all,\u201d she said. But she thought Eric was like Pax. Patient. Definitely not touchy. Loving and kind, yet very strong. And it seemed Eric, like Pax, could accept Senior as he was and find a way to get along with him. Maybe she\u2019d leave Eric in charge and she could go to the motel!</p><p>Laine would long remember this particular dinner at Cliffhanger\u2019s as one of the most pivotal evenings of her life. And not in a good way.</p><p>Senior kept talking about old cars, ones he idolized as a child and status cars like his first Mercedes. While he and Eric had a beer, Senior talked on and on about the route to the lake in New York, the price of milk and eggs, war rationing and gas coupons.</p><p>\u201cMy dad was a surgeon,\u201d Senior said, \u201cand he got more coupons so he could get back and forth to the hospitals whenever necessary, but between him and my mother, there was always a way to get to the lake. He didn\u2019t serve in the Army because he was slightly disabled\u2014one leg just a little shorter than the other from a childhood accident. He had a slight limp but it never slowed him down. He had more energy than ten men put together. I don\u2019t remember him ever having a sick day in his life.\u201d</p><p>Eric asked questions about rationing, Senior explained about \u201cneed certificates.\u201d Everyone had to demonstrate a need for major items before they could be purchased. Even typewriters were rationed because the Army needed them for communication. And then he began telling the same story again.</p><p>All of this would have happened before Senior was ten years old, but Laine had heard it all before. Except she had heard it from her grandmother, roughly twenty years ago.</p><p>When their meals came, Senior started asking about weather conditions and if it was always so cold in Virginia. He called her Janice three times. She corrected him twice and he told her again that she looked so much like her mother. Then he told her he\u2019d tried to call her but Ma Bell was very unreliable.... They hadn\u2019t called AT&amp;T \u201cMa Bell\u201d for twenty years.</p><p>As Laine watched and listened to him, she grew more and more alarmed. Senior seemed to shrink, to grow smaller before her eyes. He became vulnerable and elderly, holding his elbows close to his sides while he ate. The same man who an hour ago filled the foyer with his confidence, size and bluster was becoming frail and needy as she watched. She stared into her bread bowl of clam chowder a lot, trying to keep her eyes from misting. She exchanged a few glances with Eric and it was apparent he knew what she was thinking.</p><p>They left the restaurant when it was dark. While Eric drove the car, Senior became anxious and kept asking if it was the right way. When they pulled into the garage Senior said, \u201cOh? This is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is it,\u201d Laine said. \u201cEric, would you do me a big favor? Would you find clean sheets for the bed in the guest room? And would you take Dad upstairs and let him help you with the linens? I have something to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe glad to,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnd, Dad? Can you give me the keys to your rental car? I\u2019ll get your bag for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, his voice rather subdued. That was not her father\u2019s voice but the voice of an old, tired and confused man. He dug in his pocket for the keys and came up empty. \u201cI don\u2019t have them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know where they might be?\u201d she asked, knowing he wouldn\u2019t have an answer.</p><p>\u201cOn the hook by the back door?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said. \u201cGo upstairs with Eric. I\u2019ll find them.\u201d Since there was no hook by the back door, since there was no back door other than the one that led to the garage or the patio doors to the deck, she just went to his rental car, a midsize Ford Taurus. The doors were locked, the keys were lying on the passenger seat, there was no luggage in the backseat and his briefcase was on the floor of the car, passenger side. She went back into the opened garage, got herself a couple of tools from her toolbox and broke into the car in less than twenty seconds. The alarm sounded right away but she slid into the car, grabbed the keys and silenced it.</p><p>She popped the trunk in search of luggage, but there was none. Huh? She checked the backseat again. Nothing. She took the briefcase and keys and her tools inside. After storing her tools and lowering the garage door, she took the briefcase into the small study and her desk. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>In the briefcase she found the car rental papers\u2014he\u2019d rented the car in Portland. His plane ticket was from Boston to Portland, one way, and there was a luggage receipt but no bag. His wallet was inside along with his cell phone. She checked the phone\u2014he had missed calls from several people, from Pax, from his practice. She read a few text messages:</p><p>Dr. Carrington, Dr. Ellis of the American Association of Orthopedic Surgeons has been trying to reach you and would like you to call him....</p> <p>Dr. Carrington, Dr. Sorenson from Women and Children\u2019s is still waiting for your consult....</p><p>Dad, call me as soon as you get this message....</p><p>Dad? Just give me a call and tell me what\u2019s up\u2014I heard from your office that you were a no-show in San Francisco....</p><p>There was a sleeve of pills. It looked like so many of the samples her father had always had on hand from pharmaceutical reps\u2014Cognex. She went to her computer and looked up the drug, already knowing what it was going to say. Treatment for mild to moderate symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s.</p><p>She looked in his wallet. The usual cash and credit cards and driver\u2019s license were there, but there were also lists on small slips of paper. Notes to himself. Phone numbers for his office, Pax, his partner in the practice, reminders about appointments, medication schedule\u2014there was no other medication in the briefcase but he was supposed to be on cholesterol and blood pressure medication.</p> <p>Whew.</p><p>She left the briefcase under her desk were it wouldn\u2019t be visible. She went upstairs. She\u2019d call the Portland airport and find out if they still had the luggage Senior had checked, but that was hardly urgent now. She found Eric just smoothing the comforter over the sheets. \u201cDo you have any sweats or boxers Senior can borrow?\u201d she asked. \u201cThere\u2019s no luggage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo luggage?\u201d Senior asked. \u201cNo luggage? What\u2019s that about?\u201d</p><p>She just looked at her father. \u201cYou must be very tired. Eric will get you something to wear to bed....\u201d Ten minutes later he had brushed his teeth with a new toothbrush and was tucked into bed. \u201cI\u2019ll be downstairs for a while before I go to bed and I\u2019m going to leave a light on the stairs so you don\u2019t forget about them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t forget,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave the light on anyway.\u201d</p> <p>Once she was downstairs, she walked into Eric\u2019s arms and let him hold her. She rested her head against his shoulder. \u201cGod,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou had no idea?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThis seems pretty sudden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said you haven\u2019t spent that much time with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t. Pax sees him occasionally, much of the time they\u2019ll see each other at the hospital. But he\u2019s got it bad\u2014that can\u2019t just have happened. I have to look this up.\u201d She went to the kitchen for a glass of wine.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t your brother know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot necessarily. His specialty is children and what you have to know about specialists\u2014they concentrate on that one thing. I\u2019ve heard my dad say he barely knows what to do for a heart attack\u2014not his part of the body. Of course he was being flip\u2014he knows what to do, but he isn\u2019t the right person to treat it. They all went to medical school, basic training, but then they studied in one area in residency and in that, learned how to refer patients. But...\u201d She paused as she poured the wine. \u201cBut our paternal grandmother had Alzheimer\u2019s. My dad was always so afraid of that. Going to the kitchen and forgetting what you were there for\u2014that\u2019s normal. Going to the kitchen and forgetting it\u2019s a kitchen, that\u2019s dementia. Forgetting names, that\u2019s a natural thing for aging people. Forgetting what words like add and subtract mean and still not remembering them in five minutes\u2014that can be dementia.\u201d She took a sip. \u201cThis is a complete waste of good wine. I don\u2019t think anything short of an injection is going to relax me right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should just call Pax,\u201d he suggested.</p> <p>\u201cI was in grade school when my grandmother started getting dangerous\u2014running stop signs, forgetting the way home, leaving the stove burner on. And the final straw was when she went for a walk one night at about 1:00 a.m., barefoot and in her nightgown, in Boston, in January. That\u2019s when she had to move in with us for a while and with two working doctors in the family, that was impossible. She was moved to a special facility. I thought it was pretty nice. Of course I was a kid. My dad was horrified. I remember him saying if that ever happened to him, he\u2019d want to die. But my grandmother\u2014she thought she was on the farm. What farm we never did figure out since she grew up in the city. But she was pretty passive. She stopped remembering who people were, but she talked a lot about the farm. Wonder what farm she was on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what I can do,\u201d he said.</p><p>She just shook her head. \u201cI need a little computer time. I\u2019m grounded in facts\u2014I investigate for a living. Then I have to call my brother back. This is one of those times I have to wake him. I\u2019m sorry, Eric. I know you didn\u2019t sign on for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaine, some things just come with the territory. We\u2019ll work this out. Just tell me what you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now I need to think and talk to Pax.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a brief kiss on the forehead. Then he went out onto the deck to check out the sky.</p><p>Sixteen</p><p>It had been a long night for Laine. She\u2019d barely slept. She was listening for any disturbance from her father\u2019s room. They hadn\u2019t slept under the same roof since her mother had died so she was completely unaware of his after-dark habits. Was he going to be sun-downing, a common Alzheimer\u2019s symptom of becoming active and agitated after dark?</p><p>Eric was concerned and offered to go open the station, leave everything in the hands of Manny or Norm and come right back to make sure she was all right on her own with her father, but she told him to go. The station was probably far less stressful. And she needed time alone with Senior.</p><p>Eric had the coffee on at 5:00 a.m. and she was sitting at her kitchen table by six, making a list for herself. There were questions for her dad and Pax, decisions about what to do next. She was definitely not sending him back to Boston alone.</p><p>Before she had many items on that list, Senior came into the kitchen. He was wearing last night\u2019s clothing, of course. \u201cI guess I didn\u2019t get my bag inside last night. I couldn\u2019t find my shaving kit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit down. Let me get you a cup of coffee.\u201d She got his coffee. She sat down at the table, too, waiting while he dressed it. It was impossible not to notice he was possessed of the very thing that always set her on edge, warned of a potential storm\u2014his puffed-up chest, his lifted chin, his confidence. This morning it gave her some relief. But she knew it was going to be temporary. She pulled the pill pack out of her pocket and slid it toward him. It sat next to his coffee cup.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you known?\u201d she asked. And his chin immediately lowered.</p><p>\u201cI suspected not long after your mother died....\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God! Dad!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt first I thought it was grief. And I\u2019ve had great success with medication, with vitamin therapy. In fact, I\u2019ve wondered for years if maybe I had been wrong. It could\u2019ve been the normal aging process. A little forgetfulness... Who doesn\u2019t put the milk in the cupboard or the cereal in the refrigerator sometimes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou self-diagnosed? You self-medicated?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as if I\u2019m some amateur.... I\u2019m capable of research.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been operating!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been reducing my O.R. schedule since your mother got sick. I haven\u2019t been operating very often the past five years and never without an excellent team. There\u2019s always a qualified surgeon scrubbed in with me. And my nurse\u2014she could do it if she had to. Hell, she\u2019s as good as I am any day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut now you\u2019re done! You\u2019re absolutely done!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaine! I have managed this for five\u2014\u201d</p><p>She reached over and touched his hand but she spoke with a low and threatening voice. \u201cDon\u2019t even start with me. I\u2019ve talked to Pax. The past six months to a year there were issues. We didn\u2019t put two and two together, but now we know. You had a flood at the house and we thought it was an accident, but it wasn\u2019t\u2014the water was left running. You left a patient on the table and went to the golf course. You were a no-show in San Francisco and they\u2019re still trying to reach you to find out what happened but you haven\u2019t called them back because you don\u2019t know what happened. You have to write yourself notes and set your phone alarm to take medicine. You know what\u2019s going on and you need a neurologist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s gotten worse recently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is what happens. I was up late reading. These drugs can be very effective for mild to moderate symptoms but there comes a point they stop working. You can get by for years with occasional, brief episodes until...\u201d She just shook her head because she knew that putting it into words could shatter him. He was proud of his intelligence, his strength, his robust health. It was hard to imagine what he felt at the thought of deteriorating.</p><p>As if he\u2019d read her mind, he said, \u201cMaybe if I was ninety... Maybe then I could deal with it....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t how this works, Dad.\u201d She squeezed his hand. \u201cYou seem to be feeling quite all right this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMornings are best. If I\u2019ve slept.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know how long you might have between periods of confusion?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNot anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cAt first it was very noticeable but not real to me. You forget things, you know? Especially if your mind is elsewhere, like on work or your dead wife. Your mind wanders and it takes a second to reorient. But then one day you miss the turn to your neighborhood and drive around for a long time. A long, long time, like hours, wondering where you live. And everything around you looks like another country. Then finally you have to pull into a service station for gas and to ask where you are. It\u2019s humiliating. It\u2019s horrifying. There\u2019s no mistaking that for a wandering mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must have been terrified,\u201d she said, her voice soft.</p><p>\u201cMy wife is dead. I\u2019m alone. And I don\u2019t want to live this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not alone,\u201d she said. \u201cYou should have told us.\u201d</p><p>He laughed bitterly. \u201cJust what you need\u2014a sick old man to look after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not sick. Not yet, anyway. We need to get a better diagnosis than yours, probably new medication. We\u2019ll worry about how sick you are when you can\u2019t play chess anymore. But for right now, you just don\u2019t operate ever again. It will be a hard transition for your patients, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat am I supposed to say? I\u2019m not operating because I have Alzheimer\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>She leaned toward him. \u201cYou\u2019ll say, I\u2019m seventy. I\u2019m financially set. I have grandchildren. I\u2019m retiring. You don\u2019t have to say anything more. I have a feeling your partners will be relieved.\u201d</p><p>He seemed to relax a little. \u201cI\u2019ve been asked if anything is wrong. I insisted nothing was wrong. Now what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to go out today to buy some clothes, since you forgot your bag at the Portland airport. They\u2019re holding it. You\u2019re going to visit for a few days. Pax is going to talk to some people, line up some appointments for you at home. We\u2019ll coordinate by phone. Then I\u2019m taking you back to Boston.\u201d</p><p>He looked down. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDad, you have nothing to be sorry for. There\u2019s nothing you could have done about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor one thing, I\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve been so hard on you. I have no excuse. Janice always said I\u2019d regret it and I do. It was more than I could handle.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>She frowned. \u201cWhat was more than you could handle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything. Your job, for one thing,\u201d he said. \u201cAll that undercover crap.\u201d He sat back and ran a hand over his bald head. \u201cI was jealous of your mother\u2014she could take it. She was always the strong one, wasn\u2019t she? She was excited by it. It drove me crazy. I always worried and those times you were out of touch, I worried more. Worry made me so angry! I wanted to be like her but the best I could ever do was say nothing, and I didn\u2019t do that very well. Then you got shot and I couldn\u2019t... I\u2019m sorry, Laine. I am proud of you. But I couldn\u2019t encourage you. I was scared to death. You\u2019ve always terrified me....\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were so smart, so daring, so...fearless! I had a boy and a girl and it was my girl who wasn\u2019t happy unless she was risking her life! Pax was smart but methodical. Cautious. You? By the time you were twelve you\u2019d broken an arm and an ankle and were lucky it wasn\u2019t worse. Karate, riding, gymnastics, diving, rock climbing, parasailing, skydiving...\u201d He shook his head. \u201cYour mom used to say to me, \u2018How can the FBI surprise you? It\u2019s so in character!\u2019 I didn\u2019t want to slow you down, Laine. I wanted to stop you! I wanted you to stop taking chances so I could take a deep breath.\u201d</p><p>It all came back to her. Her entire life flashed before her eyes. Good job, Pax! Laine, damn it, back away from the edge! Excellent showing, Pax. Laine! If that horse isn\u2019t going to make the jump, go around! A good competitor doesn\u2019t take unnecessary chances! That\u2019s my boy\u2014A-plus! Laine! Not so fast! Not so high! Not so wild!</p><p>She sighed. Fear. Could it be as simple as that? Well, that and the fact that he could never just be honest and admit he felt helpless and let her reassure him. His ego was so big he could never have admitted that he was just afraid she\u2019d get hurt, which of course she did. Instead of being honest, he criticized every move she made. She always felt not good enough and tried even harder, was even more daring.</p><p>\u201cI should have just thrown you,\u201d she muttered.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing. Nothing. For whatever reason, you had no confidence that I knew what I was doing. And I knew what I was doing. I hope we can get past this....\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t lock me away,\u201d he said. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves, Dad. Let\u2019s take it one day at a time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother\u2014I had to put her in a facility for dementia patients. I know it was years ago and they\u2019ve come a long way since then, but every time I left her after a visit she cried. She begged me to take her home. I\u2019ve lived in my house for thirty-five years. Please don\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>She stood up from the table. \u201cDad, we\u2019re not going to lock you away. Right now I\u2019m going to make you a couple of eggs and toast. Then we\u2019ll call Pax\u2014you should talk to him, reassure him you\u2019re all right. Then we\u2019ll head to North Bend for some shopping. I\u2019ll give you a tour of the area. This is a beautiful place.\u201d She patted his hand. \u201cI\u2019ll be with you, don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid we make up?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all made up,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d he said. \u201cI was afraid that wouldn\u2019t happen and it would be too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not too late,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>Al was finishing up a late breakfast at the diner when Scott Grant came in. He sat at the counter next to Al and said to Gina, \u201cCan you screw up some eggs for me? I had a really long night and no breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Were you at the hospital?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was called in in the middle of the night. There was a fight at an underage party\u2014bunch of eighteen-, nineteen-year-old boys. I was up ordering head CTs and sewing all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s horrible,\u201d Gina said. \u201cPlease tell me I didn\u2019t know any of them.\u201d</p> <p>He smiled and shook his head. \u201cNo Thunder Point kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a relief,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll get you a nice big breakfast platter.\u201d</p><p>Al turned to Scott. \u201cSpeaking of Thunder Point kids, what\u2019s going on with the Russell kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you see Justin almost every day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. I see him at work some evenings. But I can tell he doesn\u2019t really want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that so much,\u201d Scott said. \u201cJustin\u2019s been trying to stay invisible for the past couple of years. He\u2019s been concentrating on holding that family together for as long as possible so he doesn\u2019t lose his brothers. He thought if he just made it to eighteen he would be left in charge, but I always warned him it wasn\u2019t quite as simple as being old enough. Even if he was eighteen or even nineteen, social services might not think of him as the best option. There are special circumstances for family foster care, but all that\u2019s irrelevant\u2014he\u2019s still just seventeen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is required?\u201d Al asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty simple. For nonfamily members, over twenty-one, self-supporting, no criminal record, pretty standard stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d he said, thinking. \u201cSo what\u2019s going on with Mrs. Russell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer condition is greatly improved and a bed is opening up for her in a facility near Coos Bay. I could send her home for a few days but I\u2019m holding off on doing that. I don\u2019t know how many times those boys can shift gears. She really can\u2019t live at home anymore. Her symptoms are worsening and soon she\u2019ll probably require a feeding tube because swallowing is difficult for her. If we get her good care she\u2019ll have decent quality of life. She could live another few months or years. I\u2019m afraid to say, no one knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, those boys are on their own now,\u201d Al pointed out.</p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d Scott said, lifting his coffee cup. \u201cI\u2019m responsible for them. I check on them a couple of times a day, but that won\u2019t work in the long term. Their case worker knows I\u2019m holding off their placement while she searches for something close. Something here in town. Something where at least the two younger boys can be together. I don\u2019t think the chances of that are very good.\u201d</p><p>Al thought about this for a moment, sipping his coffee. \u201cYou knew Justin dropped out of school?\u201d</p><p>Scott nodded just as he accepted his breakfast plate. Gina refilled both their coffees. \u201cHe thought he had to,\u201d he said. \u201cHe had to take care of his mother until he could hand her off to his brothers. Hopefully he\u2019ll go back....\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t go back,\u201d Al said. \u201cHe\u2019s past that now. What about that GED?\u201d</p><p>Between bites of eggs, Scott said, \u201cMaybe with his mother taken care of he\u2019ll have time for that. Justin was a good student but there were only so many hours in the day. Maybe he wasn\u2019t at the top of his class, but he did just fine for a kid with so much on his plate. He could\u2019ve gotten into community college, no problem. He\u2019s a sharp kid. And he cares about his family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about their father, man?\u201d Al asked. \u201cAnyone know where he is? Because shouldn\u2019t he be stepping in now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDHS knows his name and his last known location. But knowing and having his cooperation are two different things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow wait\u2014isn\u2019t it against the law to abandon your children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends,\u201d Scott said. \u201cHe and their mother divorced and he gave her custody. They can go after him for back child support but they can\u2019t turn him into a father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Al said, frustrated. \u201cIf you\u2019re lucky enough to get some sons, you\u2019d think...\u201d He shook his head. \u201cThey\u2019re nice boys,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re amazing boys,\u201d Scott agreed. \u201cI spent half the early morning hours patching up a bunch of boys who were out partying while Justin was home tucking in his little brothers. And they don\u2019t want much, they just want to keep their family together. It\u2019s not like any of them were irresponsible\u2014they just got hammered by MS. Families coping with MS need a lot of resources. A lot of support.\u201d</p><p>Al thought on this for a while. Then he asked, \u201cSo, is there a test to be a foster parent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Scott said. \u201cWhy? You thinking about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m not the right kind of person. And I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s required.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot of paperwork,\u201d Scott said with a shrug, concentrating on his breakfast once again.</p><p>Paperwork, Al thought dismally. \u201cForms,\u201d he said almost to himself.</p><p>Scott laughed. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be a government agency if there wasn\u2019t a lot of paperwork involved. But I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not complicated.\u201d</p><p>You still have to be able to read the questions and fill in the blanks, Al thought. Who\u2019d give three kids to a guy who can\u2019t fill out a form? \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the right kind of guy. I\u2019m not planning on sticking around here long. I like being flexible. You can\u2019t be real flexible if you\u2019re looking out for a bunch of kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Scott said.</p><p>\u201cHow long you figure you can hold off the foster home thing?\u201d</p><p>Scott just shrugged. \u201cAnother week, probably. I understand where they\u2019re coming from, even if it is ridiculous\u2014those boys have been on their own for two or three years and they do a better job running that household than half the adults I know. But when you get down to it, they deserve better. If they\u2019re in a decent home, they can relax and be boys. Maybe it\u2019s the threat of being scattered that keeps \u2019em in line. Or maybe Justin is just a natural.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s just scared to death,\u201d Al said. \u201cWhat\u2019s he got besides his little family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. Well, he might not be eighteen yet but he can probably be emancipated and live on his own. He has a job and is not a student anymore....\u201d</p><p>This just sounded worse and worse, Al thought. They could take away his brothers and leave him in that house alone. \u201cMaybe it\u2019ll just be temporary,\u201d Al said. \u201cHe\u2019d be able to get his brothers back once he\u2019s legal....\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. It\u2019s just that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Al persisted.</p><p>Scott turned and looked at him. \u201cThe glitch is, in order to qualify as a legal guardian or family foster parent, he has to earn a decent living. I\u2019m not sure his work at the station will keep food on the table. In the middle of all this chaos, their mother is going to pass away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Al said. But what he thought was, You\u2019re killing me here! How much were those kids supposed to take? He stood up and put his usual ten spot on the counter for his breakfast. \u201cI better think about working. I\u2019ll check on them from time to time, as long as I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I speak for a lot of folks when I say, I hope you\u2019re around for a while, Al. You\u2019ve been a good neighbor. Personally, I\u2019d hate to see you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s real nice, Doc. I\u2019m restless, that\u2019s all. I\u2019ve been traveling between three or four jobs for the past thirty years or so. It\u2019s a hard habit to break. But I always come back. Eric is a good employer. I like his shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good to know,\u201d Scott said. \u201cThanks for looking in on the boys now and then. If you have any concerns, give me a call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do,\u201d he said.</p><p>Al went to the station and had a little talk with Eric about Justin and his brothers. Eric was aware of the situation but there was little he could do to help. \u201cI can move him up to full-time. Right now that\u2019s not his biggest problem, though it will be. He told me he\u2019s looking around for a second job. His brothers are in school all day and he\u2019s here at night.... I hate to see a kid so young taking all that on, but most of the family men in this town have to take second jobs. It\u2019s the way we get by, right?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cI never thought of myself as particularly lucky,\u201d Al said. \u201cI do now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you mean. Listen, I gotta get out of here by six at the latest. Laine\u2019s dad is in town and she\u2019s going to take him back to Boston in a couple of days. He\u2019s showing some signs of...well, getting old and fragile. She doesn\u2019t want him flying alone. And she wants to make sure he gets some checkups once he\u2019s home, so she\u2019s going to take care of that. She\u2019ll be gone awhile.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought Laine\u2019s father was a doctor,\u201d Al said.</p><p>\u201cApparently they make terrible patients and aren\u2019t too good at taking care of their health. Who knew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem, Eric. I\u2019ll be here. Take off earlier. I can manage the station, you know that.\u201d</p><p>Eric slapped a hand on his back. \u201cI rely on you a lot, Al. And I appreciate it. I hope you know that.\u201d</p><p>Al grinned. \u201cThat mean there\u2019s a little something in the Christmas card for me?\u201d</p> <p>Eric laughed. \u201cChristmas is a long time from now. Let\u2019s see where you are then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, boss.\u201d He got a kick out of calling this kid \u201cboss.\u201d He wondered if Eric ever thought about that. He could actually have been Al\u2019s son, being eighteen years younger.</p><p>It was about four in the afternoon when Ray Anne stopped by for her quarter tank of gas. She was wearing a hot-pink skirt and jacket, Ray Anne\u2019s version of the business suit. And those heels that brought her up to five-foot-seven, when she was really struggling to make five-three. There was a lot of leg, a little cleavage and a great big smile for Al. He liked that; he thought her sexy clothes were cute.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going today?\u201d she asked, laying a hand full of hot-pink enamel fingernails on his forearm.</p><p>\u201cBetter now,\u201d he said, making her eyes sparkle. \u201cI can\u2019t get away early tonight. Eric\u2019s got family business and I have to close the shop and take the calls for tows. There might not be any, that\u2019s my hope. So I can\u2019t get out of here till eleven, but if you\u2019re feeling young and energetic and maybe can sleep in late tomorrow, we could spend a little time on the roof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do that,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t let me talk you into anything,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to stay dressed up. You can put on your pajamas and lotions\u2014I like you that way, too. Fact is, I like you all ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething wrong with these shoes?\u201d she asked, turning an ankle to reveal the heels.</p><p>\u201cI think they\u2019re hot,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can wear \u2019em with your pajamas if you want, but it\u2019s not necessary. You keep my attention just fine in bare feet with cotton between your toes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be up,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll have a cold beer for you and a glass of wine for myself. I can\u2019t order up a lightning show, but the stars are nice up there on the roof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you later,\u201d he said. And he felt better than he had in hours.</p><p>When Al got to Ray Anne\u2019s house she was not in her pajamas but she was dressed casually. She\u2019d managed to get the beanbags up on the roof along with a throw and a couple of candles. They took their drinks and got settled in and all the while Al was thinking, This woman is so sweet to me. She will be so hard to leave.</p><p>\u201cThings are kind of upside down around here,\u201d he said. She was snuggled up close to him and just hummed. \u201cThere\u2019s the situation with Justin and his brothers\u2014that has his friends from work worried. The kid should catch a break. And Eric said Laine\u2019s pretty worried about her father. She\u2019s going to take him back to Boston, hopefully not gone too long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me more about Justin and his brothers,\u201d she said.</p> <p>He told her the full story, starting with the day Eric asked him to look out for Justin up to that fateful day the ambulance took his mother away.</p><p>\u201cThe poor kid,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine. I never had younger siblings or children of my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you want them? Children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did when I was younger. But I wasn\u2019t married to men who wanted them so it couldn\u2019t have been a priority. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you regret it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAl, I have a pile of regrets,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cBut I also have a nice big stack of good moments, happy times when I actually mysteriously made good choices for myself. And I\u2019m happy now. That\u2019s enough for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good place to be,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one of my better choices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRay, you\u2019re one sweet little honey. That\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, I like hearing that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awful good to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the easy part. It\u2019s easy to be good to a good man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, there was a time, when I was a young farmer, that I thought the idea of a bunch of kids was exactly what I was cut out for. Life on the farm with a family was all I ever wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must have changed your mind,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cMy mind got changed, yeah. I married real young. We lived on the farm. She got pregnant right away and even though farming is hard, we couldn\u2019t have been happier. We had a baby, a boy, and he died of crib death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Al, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack then I was Mick, short for Michel. When I couldn\u2019t come to grips with the loss, I took a job driving a truck and was almost never home. My wife complained about it, but she had a lot of family and I didn\u2019t think she needed me too much.\u201d He chuckled deep in his throat and pulled Ray Anne a little closer. \u201cIn case you ever get the notion it\u2019s a good idea to run away from your troubles, I tried that one\u2014it doesn\u2019t work too well. When I was finally healed enough to put my roots back down, it was too late. Carol figured out she couldn\u2019t count on me and life was hard enough for her. That was pretty much the end of that.\u201d</p><p>Ray Anne was quiet for a moment. \u201cVery sad for both of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarol did the right thing. A few years later she married a local guy\u2014Tony. They had a couple of kids. They do a little farming but Tony is also an insurance agent and Carol is a nurse in a nursing home. You know that half a farm that was left to me? I didn\u2019t take the money and run\u2014I gave my half to Carol. She earned it. I go back there every summer and I see her. She\u2019s doing well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still love her?\u201d Ray Anne asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, sure, but it\u2019s not the kind of love you think. It\u2019s friendship. Her kids treat me like some oddball old uncle that shows up sometimes. I give her a lot of credit, you know? She was never angry with me. She was finished, but she wasn\u2019t mad. She just moved on. Got her nursing degree, got married, had a family...the things that were important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about you? Did you get to do the things that are important to you?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cWell, this\u2014right now, right here\u2014this is important. It\u2019s one of those things that might be a blessing or could be a handicap. It just doesn\u2019t take that much to make me happy. A night under the stars with my girl, that\u2019s heaven to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet you still run....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still have a phobia about getting pinned down....\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a fear of being disappointed?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, honey. Fear of being a disappointment.\u201d</p><p>She snuggled closer. \u201cYou\u2019re not a kid anymore, Al. You\u2019re a good man. Stop worrying you can\u2019t live up to expectations and just do what you know is right for you. No one\u2019s going to try to pin you down or turn you into something you don\u2019t aim to be. You\u2019re not that scared and confused young farmer anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I get a hankering to go off again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay goodbye,\u201d she said. \u201cJust say, see you later. But you don\u2019t have to run away. You\u2019re welcome here as long as you feel like staying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll admit, Ray\u2014it\u2019s real hard to think of leaving you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cGood,\u201d she said.</p><p>Seventeen</p><p>When Eric got home at five o\u2019clock\u2014early for him\u2014three suitcases were packed and lined up inside the front door. There was the rich aroma of his favorite\u2014steak soup. He knew she made it for him despite the fact that it wasn\u2019t a soup day\u2014it was sunny and bright outside, the temperature warm. He went to the kitchen, where he found Senior at the table, the newspaper spread out in front of him. Laine was stirring a pot and he went behind her. Hands around her waist, he kissed her neck and she hummed.</p><p>Her father grunted.</p><p>\u201cHello, Paxton,\u201d Eric said. \u201cHow was your day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery busy,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t do a thing,\u201d Laine said softly. \u201cWe walked down to the diner for lunch. When Gina brought lunch Senior said he\u2019d just eaten.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cThen we walked along the beach, stopped in at Cooper\u2019s and on the way home we said goodbye at the doctor\u2019s office and sheriff\u2019s office. I did the rest of the packing while Dad napped.\u201d</p><p>Over the past few days Laine told him she had seen firsthand how much her father\u2019s dementia was taking over. Mornings were best for him but his periods of confusion were longer and more frequent than she realized and by evening he was a mess of forgetfulness. It was a miracle he\u2019d gotten himself to Oregon all the way from Boston and a triple miracle he\u2019d managed the drive from Portland. If she hadn\u2019t seen his ticket for herself she wouldn\u2019t have been surprised to learn the journey had taken days.</p><p>But typical of Alzheimer\u2019s patients, his memory of things that happened long ago, in his childhood, adolescence or early adulthood was crystal clear to the finest detail.</p><p>\u201cI can still go with you,\u201d Eric said. \u201cAl and Manny can manage the station. It would be a quick trip for me, but I can help you get him there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be okay,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been inseparable for days. He does whatever I ask of him, even if he does sometimes think I\u2019m my mother. And Scott Grant gave me a mild sedative in case he gets agitated while we\u2019re traveling. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll need it.\u201d</p><p>He sniffed the air. \u201cSteak soup\u2014my favorite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere will be enough left over for you to freeze. I even got a couple of extra sourdough bowls and put them in the freezer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you could slip him a sedative tonight,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cHe\u2019s been resting very well. We haven\u2019t had nighttime issues. At least not yet. You\u2019re taking this very well.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t, actually. He was terrified that the needs of her family would take her away from him. This dynamic was pretty complicated\u2014after a lifetime of conflict with her father she suddenly learns the old boy adores her. And of course she\u2019d always adored him and longed for his approval. And now Senior needed her. It wasn\u2019t an illusion, he really needed her. Laine wasn\u2019t working full-time at the moment and Pax was committed to a difficult and time-consuming fellowship\u2014there weren\u2019t many options. \u201cI\u2019m going to miss you like mad, but I understand you have to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will stay here, won\u2019t you? In our house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you want?\u201d he asked for the tenth time.</p><p>\u201cI want to see you in my mind when I talk to you. I don\u2019t want to think of you in some hotel room or something.

Something like...I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOrange juice,\u201d she said. It wasn\u2019t a question. She poured him a glass and took it to him.</p> <p>He accepted the glass. \u201cWhy does he come around here all the time?\u201d Senior asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Eric, Dad. You remember. He lives here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he said. \u201cGood to see you, Eric,\u201d he said. He took a sip of orange juice and made a face. \u201cThis isn\u2019t Coke!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s orange juice. Would you rather a Coke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, sliding the juice away.</p> <p>She poured a Coke into a glass for him and took it to him, retrieving the orange juice.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I think maybe you should crush up one of those sedatives and put it in his soup....\u201d</p><p>Laine just chuckled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who\u2019s taking this well,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>She leaned close to him, her voice soft. \u201cSometimes it makes me laugh, sometimes I just want to cry for him, and sometimes I just get the Coke. But I think the message is pretty clear\u2014he needs me right now. He can no longer be on his own. I think he\u2019s probably lucky he\u2019s made it this long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaine! Get Eric something to drink. Eric, son, come here and keep me company. Tell me about that Packard you\u2019re working on this week!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPunctuated by periods of acuity.\u201d</p><p>Eric smiled and went to the table, sitting across from Senior. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not a Packard this week. We\u2019ve got a mess of a \u201967 Trans Am in the shop. Someone salvaged it\u2014dynamite muscle car. I\u2019d like to have it but it\u2019s not for sale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember that car,\u201d Senior said. \u201cBefore Laine was even born. I was just married and had to have a sedate car, not some hot rod, but I did love that car. What color?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo color yet. It\u2019s a rusted-out wreck\u2014needs a total restoration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake the owner choose red. There\u2019s no other color for that car!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree completely.\u201d</p><p>It had only been four days since Senior landed on their doorstep but during that time Eric and Laine had done a record amount of talking. \u201cYou will be back, won\u2019t you?\u201d he\u2019d asked quietly. She was leaving everything\u2014all the furniture and her car\u2014and had only packed two suitcases for herself. She wasn\u2019t sure how long it would take to make sure Senior had a battery of tests, had an official diagnosis and a nursing service installed to care for him, but she intended to come back to Thunder Point. She hoped it was only two weeks.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m coming back here,\u201d she had said. \u201cHow could I give you up?\u201d</p> <p>But Laine wasn\u2019t the only one who had been reading about Alzheimer\u2019s. Eric had studied it as well and one thing he learned\u2014it was irreversible. From now on it would only get worse. Senior had valiantly held it back for years, even operating as recently as three months ago. How he had managed that when today he could barely remember where he was, it was a true mystery. But then he had left his patient.... It was pretty likely he had started the day on Friday and ended the day thinking it was Saturday morning.</p><p>Eric wondered if Laine, being away from him, away from this life they\u2019d made together, would change her mind about Thunder Point. Almost daily Senior said to her, \u201cDon\u2019t leave me, Lainie! Don\u2019t lock me up!\u201d And she always said, \u201cOf course not. Don\u2019t be afraid. Everything\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>He should be encouraged that all the furnishings were left behind, but then she\u2019d be staying at her father\u2019s house, the family home as she called it. And her rent here was paid through December. Would she come back? Come back to pack? Ask him to pack her things and send them back to Boston? Send a moving company to the house to take everything?</p><p>After dinner, after a brief walk around the neighborhood to try to wear out Senior, Paxton was given a cup of hot milk. \u201cBlasted nastiest thing I\u2019ve ever had!\u201d he grumbled. Laine supervised him getting to bed. Then she shared a glass of wine with Eric and they sat on one lounge on the deck even though she\u2019d bought a second. He was behind her and she was sitting between his long legs, leaning against him, watching the sunset and then the stars.</p><p>\u201cHe asked me where we\u2019re going to go tomorrow,\u201d she said. \u201cI reminded him we\u2019re going home. Is it possible that the second it was out\u2014that he\u2019s been suffering from dementia\u2014that his symptoms just got fifty times worse overnight? Because if he was this bad at the hospital or home, wouldn\u2019t someone have noticed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Eric said honestly.</p><p>\u201cI am coming back, Eric. I will. I just need a couple of weeks to settle things. Maybe three. But I\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he lied. \u201cBefore you take on this adventure I want to be sure you know something. I\u2019ve never felt this way before. No woman before you has meant this much to me. Not ever. I love you, Laine. No matter what you have to do, no matter how long it takes you, this won\u2019t change. We\u2019re not teenagers. We can get through this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m counting on,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause I love you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we make love with the old man down the hall?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She turned, looking over her shoulder at him, grinning. \u201cIt\u2019s necessary. But you\u2019ll have to try not to scream this time.\u201d She grinned her teasing grin.</p><p>He tried his best not to let the slight feeling of panic show in his lips, hands, actions\u2014he believed her, she wanted to come back to him. He made a slow study of her body, holding himself back until he\u2019d done all her favorite things. She was the screamer, not him. But on this night she was quiet. When he\u2019d exhausted her and finally let himself go inside her, she had tears along with her fulfillment. \u201cI do love you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you more,\u201d he said.</p><p>In the morning Eric let Norm open the station so he could see off Laine and Paxton. He made sure they started off with a good breakfast that he cooked for them and then by 6:00 a.m. he had them in the car.</p><p>\u201cCall me at layovers if you can. Call me when you get there for sure. Call me too much, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll hear from me so much you\u2019ll get sick of me.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cCan\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep track of local gossip,\u201d she instructed. \u201cTake notes if you have to. Check in with my girlfriends. Tell them to text me or call me. I want to know everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll check in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back soon. Before you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll keep the place tidy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know you will,\u201d she said with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cLaine!\u201d Senior demanded. \u201cJust where the hell are we going?\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a very long day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you want to do this?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I have to. I\u2019ll call you tonight when it\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>He stood in her driveway and watched them drive off in Paxton\u2019s rental from the Portland airport. Then he went back inside and cleaned up the kitchen, put everything back in order and thought, This just isn\u2019t a home without her here.</p><p>Senior asked Laine where they were going four thousand times as they were en route to Portland. The drive was so long\u2014she wasn\u2019t sure why he hadn\u2019t chosen to fly into a closer airport, but then the whole trip was a mystery. Then the hustle and bustle of the airport riled him a little; he didn\u2019t want to let go of his bag. She had to cajole him to give it up to be checked, but let him keep his briefcase and phone, which she had turned off. Then in security, he got a little combative and she had to rescue him. \u201cHey!\u201d she said to the TSA agent. \u201cGo easy there\u2014he has Alzheimer\u2019s!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not!\u201d Senior yelled at her.</p><p>It was best to keep her arm threaded through his. She was fast catching on. Being tired, being in strange surroundings, enduring crowds of strangers\u2014these things particularly escalated his confusion. Once they were on the plane, before takeoff, Laine texted Pax. I\u2019ve only gotten as far as Portland and I\u2019m wasted already. I\u2019ll take a cab to the house but I need help tonight. Hire it if you have to, but I need some help!</p><p>Aside from the fact that she had to tell him to stay in his seat about once every fifteen minutes and through one terrifying trip to the bathroom, the plane was at least confining. Baggage claim was a little unsettling, as it was difficult to look for bags and keep an eye on Senior\u2014if he got turned around, all his orientation was messed up and he was inclined to wander. When they finally got home it was obvious Pax was in the house because it was lit up. The driver put their bags by the door and Laine paid him. Pax opened the front door and Senior walked right inside. He looked around and said, \u201cThat\u2019s better. I didn\u2019t like that other place at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Dad,\u201d Pax said.</p><p>\u201cHi, yourself. I need a drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoffee?\u201d Pax asked, then saw the shaking of Laine\u2019s head. She didn\u2019t want him caffeinated! \u201cJuice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must be tired,\u201d Laine said to her father. \u201cIt was a long day. Let\u2019s get you some tea and get you settled in bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather have a bourbon. Neat. And stop treating me like an old man!\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d she muttered. \u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d she said to Pax. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t had alcohol since he came to Oregon and I took away his medication. I\u2019d rather have his medication prescribed by a neurologist or geriatrician than an orthopedic surgeon. As long as he doesn\u2019t get impaired.... I mean more impaired. Water it, will you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd stop talking about me like I\u2019m not in the room!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Dad. But sometimes you aren\u2019t in the room....\u201d</p><p>They retired to the study, where Senior kept comfy chairs and a bar. Laine sank into a deep chair and sighed.</p><p>Three minutes later Senior said, \u201cHow much fucking water did you put in this?\u201d</p><p>Laine, being exhausted, began to laugh until she thought she might pee her pants. For real. \u201cMake me a tiny tini, will you, buddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant me to bring your bags in first?\u201d Pax asked.</p><p>\u201cThey can sit out there all night for all I care. Concentrate on the Grey Goose for now.\u201d</p><p>They sipped their drinks in oddly companionable silence. Since they couldn\u2019t talk about Senior like he wasn\u2019t present, since there wasn\u2019t much to say and Senior and Laine were both worn out, it was just the three of them. Quiet. When Senior had finished his drink, Pax got up. \u201cI bet you\u2019re ready to get to bed, Dad. I\u2019m staying over tonight so let me get you up to your room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Senior asked. \u201cIs school out?\u201d</p><p>Laine ignored her father; she was almost getting used to him being in other time zones. \u201cYou\u2019re staying over?\u201d Laine asked.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI can\u2019t give you as much time as you need, but I\u2019m staying over tonight. I have to leave for the hospital kind of early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d she said. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>She watched as Senior headed for the stairs, Pax behind him. In this house he knew exactly where to go, what to do. She took out her phone. It was only six in Thunder Point\u2014a busy time of day for Eric if he was still at the station. But he answered.</p><p>\u201cLaine. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now I know what it\u2019s like to travel with triplets under the age of six months. It was quite an exciting trip. Although it was close, I wasn\u2019t arrested for coming between Senior and a TSA agent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re home now. Pax is here and is staying the night so I can close both ears and both eyes. I\u2019m having a martini.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you drank martinis,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t had too many in my life. I\u2019m rethinking that. This has merits. I miss you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI miss you. But you made it. You got him home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the second he got in the house, everything got better for him. He\u2019s tired, that\u2019s obvious, and he\u2019s still a little wacky, but he isn\u2019t as confused. You\u2019re working late tonight?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI have to repay all those favors. The past few days everyone else has been staying late. Besides...\u201d His voice trailed off. \u201cSo, what\u2019s on for you tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you about to say?\u201d she urged.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cWithout you here, work fills up the time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t wear yourself out, Eric. I\u2019m going to be back soon. Tomorrow, not too much is happening. We\u2019ll settle in, go to Pax and Genevieve\u2019s for dinner and to see the girls. The next day we have a doctor\u2019s appointment and a counseling session with a specialist. And then it begins\u2014tests and that sort of thing. I\u2019ll keep you posted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaine...be good to yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will you do tonight?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go home. I might use your computer for a while\u2014looking for parts for the GTO. Maybe I\u2019ll watch TV....\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t watch much TV. \u201cEric, don\u2019t work too hard. Promise me you\u2019ll give yourself some leisure time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s easier when you\u2019re around,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I get a lot done, the days until you\u2019re home will go faster.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI promise,\u201d she said yet again. \u201cI\u2019m going to hang up before Pax comes downstairs.\u201d</p><p>They signed off with endearments and Laine sat in the dimly lit study. When she was growing up, this room had been off-limits. This was where her father worked on patient charts, researched, called his patients to check on them, handled correspondence. Now, here she was, the caregiver of sorts. Sitting in his space, trying to unwind from a stressful day.</p><p>Pax returned to the study and went behind the bar to fix himself two fingers of Scotch. \u201cYou mellowed out?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah. Was he comfortable in his own room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems to be,\u201d Pax said. He sat down in the opposite chair and crossed a leg over his knee. \u201cWhat about you? How are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t be more screwed up if you stuck your fingers in my brain and stirred things around in there. All my life, since I was just little, I wanted my father to love me, to be proud of me, to approve of me. Then one day he tells me he\u2019s always been proud of me, that he\u2019s in awe of me but was too afraid to praise me because he wanted me to be less daring. All the while he was holding back his approval, I was trying harder and harder to earn it by taking more and more chances. He just wanted me to be cautious and stop scaring him. And he told me this right when he admitted he came to me for help.\u201d She laughed. \u201cSo here I am. I finally have the father I always longed for. At quite a price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not an only child, you know,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re rational,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re not dealing with this conflict\u2014Senior has always approved of you. You\u2019re not still aching for a little of his affection. Not only that\u2014you have a family and a big fellowship on your plate, and Genevieve says the doctor who\u2019s taken you on is a real dick....\u201d</p> <p>Pax laughed. \u201cI knew about that going in. He\u2019s a brilliant dick. I wanted a nicer guy to work for but this one\u2014he can teach me things no one else can. This situation with Senior can be managed, Laine. I can tell in fifteen minutes his disease isn\u2019t advanced enough for an Alzheimer\u2019s facility so we can check out home health care. Genevieve has already collected names\u2014we can get right on it. I don\u2019t want you tied to this problem forever. Now, tell me something\u2014this man of yours, Eric, is he having a problem with this arrangement? You coming to Boston?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been incredibly supportive. It\u2019s all fake, but I\u2019ll take it. He hated seeing me leave\u2014I\u2019m an expert at reading people, remember. He wants me to come back as soon as possible. And I want to go home. And I also want this one chance with my father before it\u2019s too late. I make no sense.\u201d</p><p>Pax leaned forward in his chair, elbows resting on his knees, his drink in one hand. \u201cIt\u2019s always been like this with you. All or nothing. You don\u2019t fall in love till you\u2019re practically over the hill and when you do, bam! You\u2019re all in. You hate your father most of your life because he can be such an insensitive jerk and now that he needs you, you\u2019re ready to dedicate your life to him. Laine, this isn\u2019t forever. Let\u2019s get this under control so you can have your life back.\u201d</p><p>He was so right, she thought. She had such a hard time thinking one step at a time. She wasn\u2019t sure how to do this. But all she said was \u201cI feel like I just found my father. How can I leave him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s handle this with a goal that everyone gets what they need. Even you.\u201d</p><p>There was no question, Senior did so much better in his own home. He had fewer periods of confusion and his forgetfulness went unnoticed with Laine there to keep his schedule. There was, however, an aspect of his disease that would not have been noticed by his children, his housekeeper or his business partner. When Laine got into his financial records, she found he\u2019d been making crazy stock purchases in large sums and had a few deeds for property he couldn\u2019t identify. He had a room full of Civil War memorabilia, most of it still in boxes. He had been buying up commemorative gold coins\u2014they might still be worth something if they were really gold. Fortunately Laine was a detective\u2014she managed to find the plots of land and property deals and had the coins appraised, but was stuck with the Civil War stuff. Not surprisingly, Senior had been scammed a few times. Poor judgment was a major symptom and one that can go undetected if the patient isn\u2019t being closely observed.</p><p>It was something no one would have been aware was happening. Senior had always been too cynical for this sort of thing and he had been brilliant with his money. He was also very lucky, as it turned out. While he\u2019d been fleeced out of a lot of money, he had plenty left. The bulk of his money was in accounts being managed by a financial adviser with a large and reputable holding company. Laine got to work on powers of attorney to take over his finances, an argument that lasted three days and rendered Senior quite stormy.</p><p>After examinations, CT scans, blood work and counseling sessions it was confirmed by specialists that Senior might have struggled with symptoms of his disease for several years, hardly noticeable symptoms that he had somehow managed to bluff his way out of, but within the past few months his mental acuity had deteriorated drastically. Laine learned that his partners and the staff at the practice had been concerned for some time, but where they fell short was in talking to Senior rather than to Pax. He had not voluntarily reduced his schedule, his partners had insisted and urged him to get a physical. But Senior being Senior had avoided the reality for too long.</p><p>They got a couple of home health-care workers installed. They could only find part-time help, but at least Laine could get out of the house now and then while she continued looking for more help. She at least needed time off duty. And then the inevitable happened\u2014he followed in his mother\u2019s footsteps and wandered off. He walked out of the house and it took hours to find him.</p><p>\u201cNow I\u2019m having the security system updated so bells and whistles go off when a door is opened,\u201d she told Eric.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t that happen anyway?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIt seems the system hasn\u2019t been worked on in years and some of the connectors are faulty. And the old boy is slippery as an eel! I\u2019m also insisting he wear a bracelet with a GPS chip in it! And believe me\u2014he\u2019s not always cooperative!\u201d</p><p>By the end of the first week, Laine had one of her hired babysitters removed and replaced by a different one. She caught the young man rifling through Senior\u2019s papers in the study. He said he was just fetching a bank statement for Senior, but he was so nervous she didn\u2019t buy it for a second. That Senior had no recollection of asking for it didn\u2019t mean much, but still... This put a pall on the idea that she could eventually be replaced by hired help.</p><p>Mrs. Mulligrew, the housekeeper, was now coming to the house every day, though she had to hire additional help for the big cleaning jobs. Mrs. Mulligrew wasn\u2019t old but she wasn\u2019t exactly young. She was hearty and healthy at sixty and her job was to keep Senior\u2019s most used areas in check and cook meals. When bigger cleaning jobs were needed, she brought family members to help. In the past she\u2019d spend one afternoon cooking every week, setting up a few meals for him, refrigerating or freezing them. Now she was providing seven lunches and dinners every week and the home health-care provider was supposed to take care of his breakfast, a simple task since it involved cereal, toast and fruit.</p><p>But from four o\u2019clock on, Laine was on her own.</p><p>Through some periods of confusion and forgetfulness, she and her father managed many conversations. She was sentimentally drawn in, grateful for this time, yet grieving this time away from Eric.</p><p>\u201cIs he doing any better?\u201d Eric asked.</p><p>\u201cBetter? God, no! He seems to slip a little more every day. When I bring up the subject of assisted living in a specialized facility, he cries. This is so shocking\u2014I\u2019ve only seen my father get emotional once, when my mother died, and that was brief. Now he cries at the drop of a hat. I\u2019ve been secretly looking at some assisted-living places and you know what? I wouldn\u2019t want to live in one, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis keeps getting more complicated,\u201d Eric said.</p><p>\u201cI wish I was there with you. Or you here with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea when you might be back?\u201d he asked. In fact, he asked almost every day.</p><p>\u201cI was hoping a couple of weeks would do the trick, that I\u2019d get him settled and feel comfortable leaving him. Obviously that\u2019s not going to happen. But, Eric, I\u2019m trying, you have to believe me. I just can\u2019t leave him unless I\u2019m sure he\u2019s safe.\u201d</p><p>So Eric stopped asking.</p><p>Eighteen</p><p>Laine called or texted Eric several times a day and he did the same. Pictures passed between them\u2014Laine sent pictures of her nieces, her father, the whole family, even the family manse from the outside, complete with manicured landscaping and long, bricked drive. To which Eric texted back, Holy shit! You grew up in that thing?</p><p>Eric\u2019s texts and pictures were not quite as impressive. At least he didn\u2019t think so. He had looked forward to taking Laine to his sister\u2019s house in Bend for a family gathering, to introduce her to his family. Ashley had to work so he went alone. He texted a picture of his parents that, if there had been a pitchfork, could have been American Gothic. The picture of his sister and brother-in-law was a bit more friendly-looking. He had a niece and nephew, both nearly as old as he was since there was twenty years between himself and his sister, so the gathering was fairly large, but it was missing his girls.</p><p>He stayed very busy. He worked almost every shift while managing to give Justin a full-time work schedule, as well. The next set of pictures he sent were of Ashley and her boyfriend, Frank, on senior prom night. She almost brought tears to his eyes, she was so beautiful. Gina and Mac gave them and Mac\u2019s daughter, Eve, and her date, Landon, a very nice send-off. Then there was an after-prom party at Cooper\u2019s bar, which was closed to the general public and kept open for the kids.</p><p>Too soon, they were celebrating the high school graduation. The party was held at the McCains\u2019 and of course he was included. Between the ceremony and the party, he managed to text Laine a couple of dozen pictures. These town kids had done so well for themselves\u2014made their parents darn proud. Eve and Ashley would be commuting to community college together, but Frank was going to George Washington University on a full academic scholarship and Landon was going full ride to the University of Oregon and would play football for them. So, the boyfriends were leaving and the girlfriends were planning to catch up after the first year. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>Eric told Laine about everything in great detail, sent pictures of every event, even the progress on the beachfront houses on the hill between Cooper\u2019s bar and the town. He told her about every dent he pounded out, every piece of news about their friends, her friends, the town at large. And she kept him apprised of every detail of her life, which was now filled with doctor\u2019s visits, medical tests, attempts to find the right home health-care people and get-togethers with her family.</p><p>And as the time seemed to crawl by, in what felt like a year, it had been a month.</p> <p>He loved her rented house and loved the deck with its view of the bay, but going home at night, waking up there alone in the morning, was killing him. He saw her everywhere. He would come home and for a split second there would be the aroma of soup in the house...then it would disappear. He\u2019d sit on the deck at night when a storm was rolling in and feel her snuggled against him, sitting between his legs on that chaise, and it could be so real he\u2019d want to kiss her neck. He dreamed of her, reached for her, tasted her in his sleep. He loved her like he\u2019d never loved a woman in his life and she was completely out of his reach.</p><p>He blamed some of this on time zones. All those sweet whispers he wanted to hear and utter, the erotic and blissful murmurings he craved\u2014they just didn\u2019t work into the world they were now living in. These private things weren\u2019t easily said while he was digging around in an engine, or she was sitting in a doctor\u2019s office. By the time he woke at 5:00 a.m. it was already eight in Boston and Laine and her father were in full swing. Not an optimal time to ask, \u201cTell me what you want me to do to you....\u201d Late at night, when he was finally done killing time for the day, it was far later in Boston and Laine, exhausted from her day, was asleep. They could exchange I-love-yous and I-miss-yous, but those deep and sexy utterings...? It just didn\u2019t happen.</p><p>What he\u2019d begun to think of as one of the greatest romances in the history of man had become all business and local news and Eric felt like he was drying up. As each day passed by he felt she was getting further and further away.</p><p>He covered his grief with work. And with every breath he longed to touch her again.</p><p>Al Michel had found the month of May to be mostly torture. He, along with Eric and Scott Grant, vowed to make sure the Russell boys were looked after for a few weeks until they could finish the school year. Sally Russell went to a full-care facility just south of North Bend, an hour from Thunder Point. A foster home had been found for Kevin and Danny, in Grants Pass, at least a three-hour drive from Thunder Point. As soon as school ended the boys had been relocated. And Justin, who now had two full-time jobs, was left behind.</p> <p>The men, Al, Eric and Scott, were present every day right up to and including that day that Justin had to give up his brothers. They watched over him, their eyes sharpened for any signs that he might be falling apart, that he could be in trouble or despondent. But, Al observed with some pride, the boy was not only strong, but also vigilant.</p><p>Justin arranged his schedule\u2014days as a stock boy in the grocery store and nights at the gas station\u2014so that he\u2019d have Saturdays and Sundays free. Those days he got in his van and motored over to Grants Pass, picked up his brothers and took them to see their mother. He drove for hours and hours on those two days. On at least one of those days he worked at Lucky\u2019s in the evening. He put in eighty hours a week. All he did at home, where he lived alone, was bathe and sleep and clean his clothes. He didn\u2019t complain, he didn\u2019t ask for favors. He was quiet, which he always had been. But he was cheerful to the customers at both businesses.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how you\u2019re holding up, kid,\u201d Al said.</p><p>\u201cLook, all I can do is get to eighteen, show I have an income and can pay the bills and get the boys home. This isn\u2019t forever. And this is the only choice there is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t want you to work yourself to death before you\u2019re twenty,\u201d Al said.</p><p>\u201cWith you breathing down my neck all the time, I won\u2019t be able to,\u201d Justin said. \u201cBesides, you work more than forty....\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, but I\u2019m one guy. You\u2019re three guys and a sick mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got this, man,\u201d he said.</p><p>On a couple of Sundays Al was able to convince Justin to let him take him to Grants Pass to pick up his brothers and take them all to the nursing home. It gave him a little peace of mind to be there, to see the three boys together. The house they were living in wasn\u2019t much better than the one Justin was holding on to in Thunder Point, but it didn\u2019t seem like a bad place. And the younger boys weren\u2019t thrilled with it but they were making the best of it in hopes that Justin would soon be able to gather them back together.</p><p>It was a very busy town through the month and Al was included in much of it, but he never failed to check in with Justin on a daily basis. He watched the kid\u2019s weight, marked whether or not there were circles under his eyes, took it upon himself to make sure Justin was eating as well as could be expected under the circumstances.</p><p>He had Ray Anne during this time and could acknowledge, though privately, he\u2019d be lost without her. She sympathized, made him laugh, entertained him. She insisted he attend some of the local celebrations her friends were having\u2014graduation, for one. Not only did she love showing him off, but it also took his mind away from the Russell kids, separated by fate and doing everything they could to remain a family.</p><p>\u201cIs your real estate business suffering because of me?\u201d Al asked Ray Anne one night.</p><p>\u201cWhy would it be?\u201d she countered.</p><p>\u201cI ask a lot of you,\u201d he said.</p> <p>She laughed at him and said, \u201cYou never ask for anything from me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ask you to wait up late for me when I work, late enough so we can be together when you should sleep for the next day\u2019s work. I crave that rooftop when I have a night off and I want you to show me the best places to eat. And I impose on you all the time because when you take your clothes off for me, I\u2019m in heaven. A heaven I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t deserve.\u201d</p><p>And she just smiled and said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\u201d</p><p>He was so grateful to hear her say that. He was also thankful that no one ever asked him, given that he was so concerned about these boys, why didn\u2019t he take it upon himself to become the responsible adult, the foster parent. He had no reasonable excuse and would be so ashamed to have to admit that he wasn\u2019t good enough for the job. He wasn\u2019t educated, could barely read, had no experience with kids, held his own life together by the weakest thread. They should have a parent who could manage money and save for their futures, who could help them with their studies and guide them as they looked for further education. And the one chance he had at a family, he\u2019d failed them. Those Russell kids had had more than their share of challenges. He\u2019d just be one more.</p><p>Then came the day it all fell apart for him. He drove Justin to Grants Pass to pick up the boys. Danny and Kevin came outside to get in the car and Kevin had an enormous black eye under the rims of his thick glasses.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Justin said.</p><p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho did that to you? When? Why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget about it. It\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d Justin insisted. \u201cDanny, what happened to him?\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, with great trepidation, Danny said, \u201cErnest, the father, whacked him. With his fist. He told him to get in the kitchen and clean it up and take out all the garbage in the house and when Kevin didn\u2019t get right up, he shook him and then plastered him. Kevin was doing something and didn\u2019t jump on the chores. There\u2019s three of their kids and three fosters and only the fosters do the work. And Ernest drinks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen!\u201d Justin said, getting out of his van and storming toward the house.</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d Al said, running after him.</p><p>But Justin was on the move. He crashed through the front door, Al right on his heels. There was a woman in the kitchen, a real pleasant-looking woman in a pair of jeans and T-shirt, and three kids lying around the family room\u2014one with an iPad, one texting on her phone, one watching TV. And those kids, Al quickly observed, looked at Justin and Al with sneers on their faces. He couldn\u2019t guess their exact ages\u2014roughly the same as Kevin and Danny, somewhere between ten and sixteen. Two boys and a girl.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d the woman asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened to my brother, Evelyn?\u201d Justin demanded.</p><p>She wiped her hands on a towel. \u201cOh, that eye bruise? That was just an accident. Sorry about that. He was messing around and caught an elbow. You know boys!\u201d And then she smiled.</p><p>\u201cHe said Ernest slugged him because he wasn\u2019t fast enough on the chores!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of story is that?\u201d she asked, laughing. \u201cAnd who is this man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d Al asked. \u201cYour husband?\u201d</p><p>She put her hands on her hips. \u201cHe\u2019s gone out to the lake. Fishing. Now what is this about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about the black eye,\u201d Al said evenly.</p><p>\u201cIt was his own screwing around,\u201d one of the kids from the family room said.</p><p>\u201cHe said Ernest was drunk,\u201d Justin said.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no liquor in this house,\u201d Evelyn said. \u201cHe\u2019s making that up so he doesn\u2019t get in trouble for it. You\u2019re going to want to drop it right now before you make more trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiquor doesn\u2019t have to be in the house for a man to come home drunk,\u201d Al said. \u201cI expect child services will want to know. Don\u2019t you have to report injuries?\u201d</p><p>Evelyn stepped toward them, throwing down the towel. \u201cYou best think on this,\u201d she said, and she no longer looked at all pleasant. \u201cFirst off, if child services pulls that boy out of here, there\u2019s no place for him to go except emergency housing and half the time they stick \u2019em in a child haven or juvie. And they\u2019ll only take the one kid, not both. And if I get my license pulled, those two\u2019ll get split up and go to different parts of the state! There will be hell to pay. I put ice on it. It\u2019s just a bruise. He\u2019ll be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m making a complaint,\u201d Justin said.</p><p>\u201cYou complain all you want, you ungrateful little troublemaker. I was the only one willing to take both boys. If they make trouble for me, I\u2019ll turn \u2019em back and they aren\u2019t going back to you! That\u2019s for sure!\u201d</p><p>Justin ground his teeth against a rising rage, his eyes narrow and his fists clenched and Al thought, He\u2019s a thread away from launching an attack.</p><p>\u201cI have one thing to say to you,\u201d Al said soberly, calmly. \u201cYou better be sure neither of those boys gets hurt again or there will absolutely be hell to pay and you\u2019ll pay it to me. I hope you hear me, ma\u2019am, because I\u2019m not warning you again.\u201d He put a hand on Justin\u2019s shoulder. \u201cCome on, son. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>They walked out of the house, got in the car and drove for over two hours to the nursing home. Through the whole ride all Al could think was, I can\u2019t do this. I can\u2019t watch this. I can\u2019t see these young boys who have shouldered so much already be abused. This is way bigger than I am.</p><p>Scott Grant was kept very busy all through the spring. He was on call to Spencer Lawson, the high school\u2019s football and track-and-field coach. Scott was the volunteer team physician. It was a pretty laid-back job, since not many injuries occurred in these organized sports, but it meant being available and being in town when there were meets or games. That meant no moonlighting in Bandon.</p><p>In addition, there were several people he was watching over, Justin Russell being one. And he had his practice, a new practice that was constantly growing. But this was exactly what he wanted\u2014to be in a place where he was needed. A place where he was the medicine man of the town. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>And it was a good town. As spring gave way to summer, there were community celebrations for graduation, which included parties\u2014Scott was invited to all of them. And the beach was once again a warm and inviting place. Cooper\u2019s house was nearly finished and Scott helped them install shutters, hang shades, move furniture. Quite a few of Cooper\u2019s friends were also on hand to help\u2014Eric, Al, Mac, Spencer, Rawley, young Landon... And those days of working on getting the house ready were always capped off with a beer or two on the deck of the bar next door. There were barbeques on the beach and in the backyards of friends. And it seemed to Scott that to every one of these town functions, whether casually thrown together or by invitation, he attended with his children\u2014four-year-old Jenny and five-year-old Will. Everyone else attended with their spouse or significant other. Everyone except Eric, because Laine was away at the moment, but Eric was constantly seen on the periphery of their gatherings, smiling and talking into his cell phone.</p><p>If Scott was on the phone it was either to check on a patient or his kids....</p> <p>It had been four years now since he lost his wife and he hadn\u2019t even had a serious flirtation since. He thought he could keep loneliness at bay by staying busy, but it wasn\u2019t working. He\u2019d been ready, for a couple of years now, for a new relationship. It didn\u2019t have to be as perfect and loving as the one he\u2019d had with Serena, his late wife. He didn\u2019t expect it to be\u2014they\u2019d been together for so many years before he lost her. He didn\u2019t expect a miracle.</p><p>Then, while they were putting the finishing touches on Cooper\u2019s new house, Devon\u2014the best office manager he\u2019d ever had\u2014asked him if she could take a little time off. \u201cI don\u2019t think I have any vacation coming,\u201d she said. \u201cBut could I take a few days, maybe five, without pay? Spencer and I want to get married the first part of July. Just a quiet ceremony, close friends only, but we\u2019d like to go away alone for a couple of days. Cooper will see that Mercy and Austin are covered.\u201d</p><p>Scott was momentarily stunned. Of course he knew they were planning on marrying. But his life seemed to be filled with people who never expected to find partners and were now not only all hooked up, but also blissfully happy. All he could think of to say was \u201cWhat if Sarah has the baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if that happens, we\u2019ll want to rush home,\u201d Devon said. \u201cBut there\u2019s lots of backup\u2014Rawley, Gina and Mac, all the teenagers, your nanny Gabriella. For her sake, I almost hope it happens\u2014she\u2019s not due for weeks but she\u2019s already awful big.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said. \u201cSure. Yes. Take all the time you need. And I\u2019ll be your backup, too. Mercy is as at-home at my house as yours. And Austin\u2019s a flexible kid. He\u2019s real portable. He\u2019d be happy with me, with Landon, with lots of people. And Devon, you can have five paid days. After all you\u2019ve done for me, it\u2019s the least I can do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks, Doc. We\u2019ll plan something in that case. We were going to wait till the house is finished but heck, we just don\u2019t want to wait.\u201d</p><p>The memory of feeling he just couldn\u2019t wait filled him with the miserable longing that had become his constant companion. Maybe before too many more years passed he would meet someone who made him feel that way.</p><p>Again.</p><p>Al knew Justin wouldn\u2019t be eighteen until September and there was no guarantee that would be enough to get him custody of his brothers. The case worker he\u2019d been in touch with told him to expect to be told to wait until he was nineteen and suggested he get to work on that GED so he could improve his income, so he could promote himself in his jobs.</p><p>As if he had a spare hour for that...</p><p>Al was so proud of the kid, ached for the kid. After a brief family meeting in the car, the boys decided that it was probably best not to complain to child services, best not to rattle any cages and get split up or yanked into some even worse emergency foster care. Kevin promised to say \u201chow high\u201d when someone said jump\u2014he wouldn\u2019t take any chances. Al wasn\u2019t crazy about that decision but he understood it. They were scared. He wondered if they\u2019d ever stop being scared.</p> <p>His greatest solace was in Ray Anne\u2019s arms. He loved her rooftop and loved her on the rooftop. That was where they had not only the most physical pleasure, but also their deepest, most personal conversations. She revealed so much about herself, about the men she\u2019d been so briefly married to, about hopes and dreams she\u2019d given up years before in favor of being an independent woman who wouldn\u2019t ever have to rely on a man. And for his part, Al told her more and more about his brief marriage, his years on the road, his annual trips back to Boone, Iowa, on the birthday of his son, who if he had lived would now be thirty-eight years old.</p><p>Instead of saying \u201cAwww, darling,\u201d Ray Anne smiled against his lips and said, \u201cMy age.\u201d And they laughed and laughed.</p><p>They had that thing going for them, when they could make even the most serious subjects light and humorous.</p><p>In early June, while he held her on the rooftop, he said, \u201cI want you to know, I haven\u2019t really loved a woman in so long I forgot what it felt like. But I think this is how it feels. Ray, no matter what happens I want you to know you\u2019re one fine woman and you\u2019ve made me really happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo matter what happens?\u201d she asked. \u201cAre you terminal or something?\u201d</p><p>He just laughed and pulled her closer. \u201cGod, no. I\u2019m so healthy it\u2019s scary. But I\u2019ve learned over the years not to forget to say important things. I was on the road when my dad died and never got to tell him how much he meant to me. It was a lesson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then,\u201d she said, \u201cyou should know, I think you\u2019re the love of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t be. You\u2019re too sexy, too sweet, too beautiful....\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou are. I\u2019ve been with plenty of men but I think it was all practice. I feel so good with you. Every part of me feels good\u2014the body parts, the heart, the mind, the humor, the part that thrives on friendship. I think, if I had to go back through all the men I\u2019ve known, you\u2019d be the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet you\u2019ll change your mind about that,\u201d he said.</p><p>And she had raised over him, looked down into his eyes in the candlelight on the rooftop and said, \u201cNo, Al. I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The next day at noon he packed up his two duffels, some tools he owned and had been using and drove his truck to Lucky\u2019s. Of course Eric was there. All he did was work since Laine was away. Justin hadn\u2019t come to work yet and Al was glad. He passed the key to the room at the Coastline Inn to Eric and said, \u201cSorry, boss, but I got a call from a friend who\u2019s in a bad spot. He has an emergency and needs my help. I know this is no notice and real inconvenient and I\u2019m awful sorry. The room is paid up and I\u2019m moved out but I didn\u2019t check out just in case you know someone you want to give it to, what with that refrigerator and toaster and all.\u201d</p><p>Eric took the key and shook his hand. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll be back, Al. You\u2019re a great asset to my business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate you saying that. I know I usually give you more notice but this came up real sudden.\u201d But of course, he didn\u2019t say what it was, exactly.</p><p>\u201cThose things happen. If you have the opportunity and interest, you\u2019re always welcome here. We can always use you. Did you tell Justin you\u2019re leaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t able to do that.\u201d He pulled an envelope out of his shirt pocket. \u201cI don\u2019t have much explanation, it\u2019s just a friend I\u2019ve helped out over the years and he counts on me, especially when things go crazy for him. Would you give this to the kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Of course. And you have my number, if you need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope I\u2019m not gone too long. Turns out I like it here. This was a smart move for you. And I hope it all works out with Laine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings always work out,\u201d Eric said. \u201cIf I haven\u2019t learned anything else, I learned that. It\u2019s just that while you\u2019re waiting for things to work out, it gets real old. But that\u2019s life, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s life, all right. Good luck, boss,\u201d Al said. And he got in his truck and drove out of town.</p><p>Nineteen</p><p>Justin showed up for work right at three, clean and pressed. Eric realized that his mother had little or nothing to do with the laundry and ironing of his clothes. No doubt he\u2019d heard Eric ride the old guys about keeping up their uniforms, and needing this job like he did, he towed the line carefully. He wasn\u2019t getting any better at cutting his own hair, so he\u2019d let it grow and was trimming the bottom. In another couple of months he\u2019d just be tying it back in a ponytail.</p><p>Might as well just rip the Band-Aid right off, Eric thought. \u201cAl had an emergency of some kind, Justin. He had to leave. He left this for you,\u201d he said, handing over the envelope. \u201cMaybe that explains better.\u201d</p><p>Justin tore into the envelope immediately. There was a small piece of paper and a check. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t,\u201d Justin said, showing Eric the note. It said, Little help. Good luck. And that was Al\u2019s handwriting, all right. Miserable. He hadn\u2019t written the check. It was a cashier\u2019s check drawn from the local Thunder Point bank. It was for two thousand dollars.</p><p>Eric whistled.</p><p>\u201cDid he say what the emergency was?\u201d Justin asked.</p><p>\u201cSorry, he just said a friend was in a tight spot and needed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s good, I guess. Everyone should have friends.\u201d He said it like someone who had no friends. Justin put the check and note back in the envelope and shoved it in his pants pocket.</p><p>\u201cYou want to run that over to the bank before it closes?\u201d Eric asked.</p><p>\u201cNah. That\u2019s okay.\u201d Then he went for the broom to start sweeping up.</p><p>Eric followed him. He put a hand on his shoulder. \u201cJustin, that\u2019s a cashier\u2019s check. If it gets lost or damaged, it\u2019s no good. Take it to the bank....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have an account there,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cGo open one,\u201d Eric said. \u201cYou can\u2019t afford to carry around something like that. At least in the bank it\u2019s insured. Even if the bank gets robbed or burns down, they\u2019ll make good on your money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I need money fast?\u201d Justin asked.</p><p>\u201cWithdraw it from the bank,\u201d Eric said.</p><p>\u201cAnd if the bank\u2019s closed? If it\u2019s the middle of the night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you whatever you need,\u201d Eric said, asking himself why Justin would need money fast? In the middle of the night? \u201cIf you have an emergency, wake me up. I can get together whatever you need.\u201d</p><p>Justin smirked. \u201cI should\u2019a known you were a moneybags.\u201d And he started sweeping.</p><p>Eric grabbed the broom. \u201cHow are your brothers doing, Justin?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cThey get by okay,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not good where they are but they can deal for a couple more months. Seems like those people got themselves some slave labor so no one else would have to do chores there. Just the woman and the foster kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot good,\u201d Eric agreed.</p><p>\u201cIf they don\u2019t move fast, they get cuffed,\u201d Justin said. Then he made a motion like a whack upside the head.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not good,\u201d Eric said more emphatically. \u201cYou should tell someone about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we talked about that. But the system could separate them and send them farther away where I can\u2019t get to \u2019em unless I move and I don\u2019t want to give up the house unless I have to. I got it handled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWe give it a couple\u2014three more months. In September I\u2019m eighteen and if they don\u2019t turn the boys over, I\u2019m just taking them out of there. That\u2019s how. We don\u2019t do people like that.\u201d And he tried wrestling that broom away from Eric. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>Eric held on. \u201cGo to the bank. I\u2019ll keep you on the clock. Don\u2019t screw with a big old check like that. You might need the money. And if you have an emergency and can\u2019t get to the bank, I\u2019ll fix you up with what you need. Get yourself checks and a debit card and a credit card. You shouldn\u2019t be living off cash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure how all that stuff works. I been just cashing my checks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy. They\u2019ll explain it at the bank and if it\u2019s not real clear, I\u2019ll explain it further. Now go.\u201d Justin gave a lame shrug and turned to go. \u201cListen,\u201d Eric said, stopping him. \u201cListen, Justin, I know it probably feels like Al ran out on you but he didn\u2019t. This is his way\u2014he\u2019s a rover. I\u2019ve known him a real long time and he\u2019s usually on the move, a few months here, a few there. He\u2019ll show up again. Meanwhile, you can count on me. This is my business. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTill Laine tells you she can\u2019t get back here on account of her dad and wants you to go there,\u201d Justin said.</p><p>\u201cMan, you think a lot more than you let on,\u201d Eric said, shaking his head. \u201cI doubt that would happen. Ashley is here and I have a lot of time to make up with her. If I leave Thunder Point it won\u2019t be fast, you can count on that. First that girl needs to be all grown up and on her own and second, I\u2019d have to sell a business. I don\u2019t leave notes behind. I tell the people in my life what I\u2019m planning to do so you can count on me, okay? Don\u2019t go doing something crazy like kidnapping your brothers in the dark of night. Talk to me. I\u2019ll do whatever I can to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Justin said, clearly unconvinced.</p><p>Eric sighed. \u201cGo to the bank.\u201d</p> <p>Eric knew what would help Justin. Everyone knew. He needed a foster parent. And Eric was tempted. He knew it wouldn\u2019t be more work than he could handle\u2014those boys knew how to live independently. But if he took on that job he\u2019d have to live with them and he had waited his whole life for something else, something he thought he might have with Laine. They had enough working against them. A whole continent separated them and he wasn\u2019t sure how long that would be the case. He hoped not too much longer but in his heart he knew she could be committed for a long time. A mean and selfish little voice said, If she hadn\u2019t made up with Senior, this would be someone else\u2019s problem. Then the gentler side of him said, She waited her whole life for Senior to be proud of her, to rely on her. He was lonely but, though difficult, he was happy for her. No one should lose their parents before things were settled with them. And he\u2019d be ashamed to admit the number of times he wanted to beg her to come back. Just ask your brother to hire someone to take care of Senior and come back. At least he hadn\u2019t given in to that temptation.</p><p>He picked up the phone in the office and called the diner. Maybe he could find out something that would ease Justin\u2019s mind a little. Gina answered and he said, \u201cHey, Gina, it\u2019s Eric. Do you have a phone number for Ray Anne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. You looking for real estate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have more real estate than I know what to do with,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cAl left today and he said he had a friend who needed him. I wonder if Ray Anne knows any more than that. Justin looks like he lost his best friend. Which I guess maybe he did.\u201d</p><p>This idea turned out not to be one of his best. When he asked Ray Anne the question she said, \u201cGone? He left? When?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt around noon. He said a friend needed his help. He didn\u2019t have a better or more detailed explanation for you?\u201d</p> <p>She was quiet for a long moment. \u201cNo,\u201d she finally said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ray Anne,\u201d Eric said. \u201cI assumed he\u2019d tell you he was leaving. Say goodbye. Or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have assumed that also,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll call you, then,\u201d Eric said.</p><p>\u201cI have a cell phone\u2014he has a cell phone. There are no messages or texts. He doesn\u2019t like to text\u2014he thinks it\u2019s impersonal. Did he say where he was going or when he\u2019d be back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. Thanks for letting me know, Eric. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t find out another way....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you know if I hear from him,\u201d she said. Then she disconnected the call.</p><p>Well, way to go, Al, Eric thought. In all the years he\u2019d known Al he couldn\u2019t remember a time when it went down like this, a bunch of hard feelings and broken hearts left in his wake. What the hell happened? he asked himself. Too much pressure? Did things get a little too tight for him with Ray Anne and Justin, both needing him?</p><p>It must have been a real emergency, Eric thought. Al really liked Ray Anne. And unless he missed all the signals, he was committed to helping Justin.</p><p>But the phone didn\u2019t ring. At least not with a call from Al.</p><p>Laine called twice and they filled each other in on the day and for some reason he couldn\u2019t really explain, he didn\u2019t tell her about Al leaving. He asked after her family and she reported that she was going to have to let another home health-care worker go\u2014she suspected he was dipping into the liquor cabinet in the study. Either that or carrying a flask\u2014she could smell alcohol on his breath. Senior was doing quite well; it seemed like there were very few bad days, knock on wood. He needed a companion, that much was evident; he couldn\u2019t live alone. Most of his daily functions he managed independently. He could bathe, shave with a new electric razor\u2014no more razor blades, not even disposables\u2014but he couldn\u2019t cook or drive alone. There was too much potential for disaster.</p><p>If anyone in my family ever gets Alzheimer\u2019s I am now an expert, Eric thought.</p><p>Of course it wasn\u2019t long before people started asking, \u201cWhat\u2019s that I hear about Al?\u201d, since Eric had let the cat out of the bag. Other than that, it was a quiet afternoon and evening at the station. He sent Justin home a little bit early and told him to get some rest. Then he closed up and went home.</p><p>Every time he walked into that house he braced himself for a miracle. When she was here, she always at least left a light on in the kitchen and something in the refrigerator, but more often she was waiting for him. But the house was cool and dark. He didn\u2019t turn on any lights. He walked toward the doors to the deck and saw the lightning flashing over the mouth of the bay, a distant rumble of thunder grumbling. It wasn\u2019t going to develop into a full-fledged storm, but Laine would have liked the lightning.</p><p>He thought he heard something. Music. Laughter. Splashing. Before he even gave himself a second to think about it, he ran for the stairs, took them two or three at a time. The bedroom was unchanged; the bed was made but not turned down. They had had a rule, last one out makes the bed.... The bathroom was dark and empty but if he closed his eyes he could sense her there, the candlelight flickering, her iPod plugged into the speakers, the smell of her bath stuff. He could almost hear her laughter and a little splashing around while she waited for him in the tub. Then the next morning at five when he was in the shower she\u2019d ask him why. Wasn\u2019t he clean enough after that romp in the tub? And he\u2019d carefully explained that he smelled like a girl and his customers didn\u2019t like prissy mechanics.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t count the nights he reached for her....</p><p>God, he missed her.</p><p>He put his hands in his pockets and felt his keys. He felt the key to the room at the Coastline Inn.</p><p>He went to the closet and pulled his duffel off the high shelf. He put it on the bed and filled it with shirts and pants and boots; he grabbed his shaving kit and added it. She wanted him to be here, in her house, but she had no idea what it did to him. No matter how many times he changed and laundered sheets, he could smell her. He had erotic dreams about her and woke in the night with the taste of her in his mouth. And every time he came home the longing was greater. And the fear those days and nights would never come again grew more fierce.</p><p>He closed the duffel and locked the door behind him. He had his phone and his laptop; she would never find him hard to reach. But he needed her here or it was just too much. He\u2019d come back of course. He\u2019d come every couple of days, make sure it was safe, kept in order, ready for her return.</p><p>He walked to the Coastline, his duffel in one hand, his laundered and bagged uniforms over his shoulder. He was better off here.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d Lou McCain asked Carrie James over the phone. \u201cShe\u2019s not at Cliff\u2019s, she\u2019s not answering her phone, her house is dark. Do you think she drove into the bay? Drowned herself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver a man? Are we talking about the same Ray Anne?\u201d Carrie asked. \u201cPlease. She\u2019s probably soaking in the tub so she\u2019ll be nice and clean when she puts little pins in his voodoo doll.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI drove over there. The house is dark and she\u2019s not answering the door,\u201d Lou said.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know where to look,\u201d Carrie said. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSitting in front of the sheriff\u2019s office, trying to figure out where to go next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing in Thunder Point?\u201d Carrie asked. Since Lou had married last fall, she didn\u2019t live with her nephew, Mac, any longer. Her home with Joe was midway between Thunder Point and Coquille. She taught in Thunder Point, but school was out for the summer.</p><p>\u201cI was talking to Gina, asking if she needed any help with the kids this week, and she asked me if I knew about Ray Anne. Apparently Al just took off, without explanation. Hey, maybe she went with him!\u201d Lou suggested.</p><p>\u201cOur little real estate magnate? Fat chance. Meet me in front of Ray Anne\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you she\u2019s not there! And I don\u2019t normally overreact, but I\u2019m kind of worried about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just sulking,\u201d Carrie said. \u201cMeet me out front. I\u2019ll show you where she is. Then you can relax and go home. And I can go to sleep. Some of us work in summer, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of us are very grouchy year-round,\u201d Lou said. She hung up.</p><p>There was a time when Lou McCain and Ray Anne Dysart couldn\u2019t get along for five minutes. Then age, experience, patience and wisdom settled in and things eased and even became friendly. Well, and Lou got married and Ray Anne finally stopped stealing Lou\u2019s boyfriends\u2014that could have had something to do with it.</p><p>Lou and Ray Anne had known each other since high school in Coquille and they\u2019d always been like oil and water. They were opposites, to say the least. Lou had been studious and pretty serious while Ray Anne had been all about fun. She\u2019d been wearing her clothes too tight since way back then, and she always had a bunch of guys. But back then a bunch wasn\u2019t enough\u2014she had to have everyone else\u2019s guy, too.</p><p>Lou and Ray Anne rarely saw each other after high school until they were reconnected in Thunder Point. At first it was like the same old rivalry\u2014Lou in her sensible shoes and Ray Anne in her tight skirts and heels. But then they settled into an uneasy truce that actually became a friendship. Still nothing alike, they somehow managed to appreciate each other. Lou liked her now. And she felt bad about this\u2014that a man Ray Anne had not only liked, but also counted on, would just bolt.</p><p>Carrie\u2019s deli van was sitting in front of Ray Anne\u2019s house when Lou pulled up. They got out of their vehicles and met in the street; Carrie was still wearing her big full-body apron with the deep pockets, as though she\u2019d been cooking. She was holding a bottle of wine as big as a horse\u2019s leg. \u201cFollow me,\u201d she said. She went around the garage, reached over the top of the gate to unlock it and pushed it open so she could get into the backyard. She rounded the garage and went to the stairs that led to the roof. When they got to the top, there was candlelight. \u201cYou better be alone,\u201d Carrie said into the darkness. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Ray Anne asked. She was sitting on the floor of the deck, cross-legged. She was wearing sweatpants, something Lou didn\u2019t imagine she owned. And a long shirt. No bra; her boobs were on her chest. Completely. No further curiosity about the boob job... And she wore leather slippers to keep her piggies warm. This was a side of Ray Anne that Lou had never seen.</p><p>\u201cWe came to sit shiva,\u201d Lou said. \u201cWord\u2019s out\u2014there was a death.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI doubt he\u2019s dead,\u201d Ray Anne said. She sipped from her wineglass. \u201cJust gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Lou said, looking around. \u201cThis is really something....\u201d</p><p>Carrie put the wine bottle on the deck and slowly, achingly, got down, settling into a beanbag. \u201cIf I make even a little profit this year, I\u2019m buying you chairs for your birthday. My knees protest this sitting on the floor. It\u2019ll take both of you to get me on my feet again.\u201d Then she pulled a corkscrew out of her pocket.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have glasses up here,\u201d Ray Anne said.</p><p>Carrie took a couple of plastic wineglasses out of her other pocket, fixing the stems on them. \u201cI\u2019m a caterer,\u201d she said, deadpan.</p> <p>\u201cWow, this is really something,\u201d Lou said again. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t I ever seen this before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s private,\u201d Ray Anne said.</p><p>\u201cBut Carrie has obviously seen it....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imposed on Ray Anne when Ashley was having her hard time over breaking up with stupid Downy last year, when we were all holding our breath to see if she was suicidal or just brokenhearted. Ray Anne brought me up here. We drank a bottle of wine and talked about all our broken hearts. It helped, except there\u2019s no broken heart like your daughter\u2019s or granddaughter\u2019s. I\u2019d have my heart carved out of my chest a hundred times rather than watch them go through it.\u201d</p><p>Lou sat down on a beanbag and reached for a glass of wine.</p><p>\u201cHow about me?\u201d Ray Anne asked. \u201cHow do you like watching me go through it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been through it before,\u201d Carrie said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ray Anne. But you\u2019re smart and independent and you\u2019ll heal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not for a few days,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cTalk about him,\u201d Lou said. \u201cDid you love him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI loved them all,\u201d Ray Anne said, tipping the bottle over her glass. \u201cI really did. But I think I maybe loved Al the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you always feel that way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot always, no,\u201d Ray Anne said. \u201cSometimes I think they\u2019re fun, or maybe they\u2019re sexy. Or maybe they make a decent living and seem civilized and in want of a good partner. Or...I don\u2019t know. Sometimes they can dance....\u201d</p><p>Lou spewed a mouthful of wine. \u201cThey can dance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI stopped looking for happily ever after a long time ago,\u201d Ray Anne said. \u201cI haven\u2019t been expecting some perfect man to come along and carry me off on his charger. I just don\u2019t want to be alone all the time. And I like...you know...sex.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe know,\u201d Carrie and Lou said at the same time.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just who I am,\u201d she said. \u201cAl liked everything about me. I knew he never stayed in one place for long but I had no idea he was leaving. It seemed like he had a lot to anchor him here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike his job, for one thing. He loved working with Eric. He likes the way Eric does business. He called it \u2018straight up,\u2019 which I guess means straightforward and honest. Then he got himself involved in those Russell boys with the sick mother. That oldest one, Justin, he\u2019d started depending on Al. I can believe he walked away from me but I\u2019m having a hard time thinking about him walking away from that boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can you believe he walked away from you?\u201d Lou asked.</p><p>Ray Anne shrugged and looked down. \u201cWell, hell. They always leave me before long.\u201d</p><p>Lou coughed. \u201cNo!\u201d she barked. \u201cNo, no, no, no, no! They become mental eventually and fail to see what\u2019s before them! Ray Anne, you\u2019re a good person. You don\u2019t deserve that. I want you to stop thinking you deserve that right now. This second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they do,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you leave them sometimes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, we\u2019re women of some...ahem...experience. We\u2019ve been around. We\u2019ve broken up with a few men, a few of the imbeciles have broken up with us, but this has nothing to do with who and what we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are women, watch us roar,\u201d Carrie said tiredly. Then she yawned.</p><p>\u201cExcept Carrie,\u201d Lou amended.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a very fast learner. When my husband walked out on me, left me with no income and a small child, I was suddenly and not surprisingly no longer interested in romance. I was interested in paying the rent and grocery bill. And I\u2019ve been perfectly happy that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might be happier if you got laid once in a while,\u201d Lou said. To Carrie\u2019s sharp and sudden stare, Lou put up a hand. \u201cJust saying...\u201d Then she pulled her cell phone out of her pocket and rang up a number. \u201cHey, Joe, honey. Listen, I\u2019m over at Ray Anne\u2019s with Carrie and we\u2019re working our way through a large bottle of wine. I\u2019m going to have to stay over, unless you want to pick me up. Why? Because Ray Anne got dumped and she\u2019s a little depressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d Ray Anne said, sipping. \u201cBitch...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d Lou asked into the phone. \u201cThat\u2019s so sweet. Don\u2019t be early. I\u2019m going to have to drink a lot of wine to get her through this. Okay. I love you, too.\u201d Then she ended the call and smiled dreamily at her friends. Carrie was reclining on the beanbag, holding her wine perched on her belly. \u201cHe likes sleeping with me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good because I don\u2019t,\u201d Ray Anne said.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s going to be hardest to give up?\u201d Lou asked.</p><p>\u201cDid you know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little,\u201d Lou said. \u201cNot well, but he seemed likable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I loved that he was so even-tempered. Nothing really got to him, you know? When he told me about the boys, it made him sad for them. And he cared about them\u2014he drove them to see their mother a few times and we\u2019re talking hours of driving. Hours. He could talk about personal things pretty easily\u2014when have you ever seen that in a man. He was so sensitive and kind and yet did you get a load of that body. I think he said he was fifty-six and he\u2019s hard as a rock. But that smile\u2014he has the greatest smile. He\u2019s funny, too. He\u2019s interesting\u2014he\u2019s done so many different things. He can discuss anything. He\u2019s brilliant, though I suspect he can\u2019t read....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Lou said. \u201cWhat? He can\u2019t read?\u201d</p><p>Ray Anne shrugged. \u201cI never had the guts to ask. I think he thinks no one knows. I suspected by the second date\u2014he just glances at the menu and asks me to order. Or he makes an excuse about his glasses\u2014either he forgot them or they\u2019re dirty or something. And he answered a couple of texts I sent him and I know he\u2019s got big thumbs, but seriously, his words were incomprehensible. I bet he can\u2019t read. He listens to books when he\u2019s traveling or falling asleep and he\u2019s listened to some mighty heavy titles, but I asked him once to put vinegar on my shopping list and he just didn\u2019t do it. Maybe it\u2019s dyslexia or something. Or he just never learned, growing up on a farm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t ask him?\u201d Lou queried.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI thought he\u2019d tell me eventually. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s why he left. He left because...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a friend in need,\u201d Lou said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s why he left. But why didn\u2019t he say goodbye? Why didn\u2019t he just tell me he had to leave? We could\u2019ve kept in touch. I didn\u2019t expect him to marry me! So why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, kiddo. Men are idiots sometimes.\u201d</p><p>Ray Anne sighed. \u201cHe was so considerate. So tender. You just don\u2019t expect this from a man like that. When we made love, he was such a wonderful gentleman. We made love up here when there was lightning over the bay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEw,\u201d Lou said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t on this beanbag, was it?\u201d</p><p>Ray Anne made a face and tipped the wine bottle over Lou\u2019s glass. \u201cJust drink.\u201d</p><p>A soft snore came from the direction of Carrie\u2019s beanbag. Lou reached over and extracted the plastic wineglass from her hand and put it on the deck.</p><p>\u201cShe gets up real early,\u201d Lou said. \u201cWe\u2019ll wake her when Joe gets here later. We\u2019ll just get a little drunk and talk about Al. When you\u2019re done extolling his virtues we can start to bash on him\u2014that helps. And it better not have been on this beanbag\u2014I\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>Twenty</p><p>Laine saw Genevieve about three times a week when she stopped by Senior\u2019s house. If she came later in the day, she often brought the girls with her. Pax, not so much, given his crazy schedule, but he checked in with her by phone almost every day. Senior was doing very well most days, as long as he was in familiar surroundings. She tried to get him out daily\u2014she took him along to run errands, to drop by the driving range, he even played eighteen holes a few times with a couple of his friends, although that made her terribly nervous, afraid he\u2019d have one of his episodes of dramatic confusion and maybe wander off on the golf course. They also worked out together in the small gym he kept at the house. Exercise almost always had positive results.</p><p>For the most part he was lucid, but a day didn\u2019t pass that he wasn\u2019t on another planet\u2014sometimes briefly, sometimes for as long as several hours. There was no question about it, he wasn\u2019t going to get better. It was all about quality of life and realistic expectations. Mornings were usually Senior\u2019s best time, though Laine did catch him headed for the garage one morning, carrying his bag and saying he was going to the hospital for rounds. Convincing him that he wasn\u2019t was quite the battle. It was Mrs. Mulligrew who sidetracked him with \u201cNot until you\u2019ve had your breakfast, Dr. Carrington. Come with me\u2014I\u2019m getting it ready for you right now.\u201d</p><p>They went to a support group. Laine went alone at first, then she took Senior with her and he was devastated to see the more critical Alzheimer\u2019s patients there with family members or caregivers, so she was back to going alone. The people were mostly cheerful and encouraging but their lives were changed forever by this thief of the mind. Those afflicted ranged in age from sixty to ninety; some families had been living with Alzheimer\u2019s for almost twenty years!</p><p>Senior had been doing a lot of crying. That was one of the ways Laine knew he was having a hard time. He whimpered softly and great big tears rolled down his cheeks when she told him she was going out for a little while. Not every time, but often enough that it filled her with such concern she phoned his doctor. The doctor said this was not unusual and to reassure him that she\u2019d be back.</p><p>This was somehow more devastating to her than his blustering, than all the criticism and doubt he\u2019d cast on her for years. To see this big, strong, stubborn man reduced to tears so often just wounded her. But she refused to let it show. \u201cNow, don\u2019t be upset, Dad, I\u2019m just going for a run and I\u2019ll be right back. Jed will be here with you. Why don\u2019t the two of you play some cards or cribbage or something?\u201d</p><p>Laine, so good at stiffening her spine, being strong and capable, left her father in the hands of his nurse\u2019s aide, a very agreeable young man who had been with them two weeks and things were starting to fall into a routine.</p><p>Until she got back from her five-mile run. Something was not right. While she was cooling down, walking in slow circles around the driveway, she smelled something in the air. Something that smelled like talcum powder mixed with something. So she walked around the garage. She had to edge through some bushes to get to a pretty secluded part of the backyard, where good old Jed was smoking a joint. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cWell. Hello,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOh, shit,\u201d he said. \u201cLook, it gets a little tense sometimes, okay? I\u2019m perfectly good. I\u2019m a hundred percent. Seriously.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPack it up, junior. You\u2019re unemployed. I\u2019m calling your boss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll deny it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Go for it. Deny away. Oh, by the way, did my father happen to mention I\u2019m an FBI agent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could\u2019ve been worse,\u201d she said. \u201cI could be DEA. Lucky for you I don\u2019t give a rip about your drug habit as long as you don\u2019t work in home health-care ever again. Now get out of here before I just give in to temptation and beat you up. Loser.\u201d</p> <p>He disappeared pretty fast, but Laine lost the tough act and sank to one of the benches outside the study doors. Another one, gone. She\u2019d been here almost six weeks and had been through six aides. There was one who was working out\u2014Carl. He was fifty-six and had done this work for years, came highly recommended and from what she could observe he did an excellent job. She\u2019d asked him for recommendations but those he thought of highly were otherwise engaged. He was more expensive than most and from what she was learning, worth every penny. But they needed two attendants. At least. She couldn\u2019t leave her father until he was covered 24/7.</p><p>Although she was feeling very sorry for herself she knew she should be grateful. Her father was lucky. He had enough money to pay for the disabilities of his old age. What was she thinking? She was lucky! What would she do if there was no money to pay for all this caretaking? Except that right now she was the only caretaker.</p><p>Laine entered the house. Mrs. Mulligrew was in the kitchen, giving it a good cleaning, but Laine couldn\u2019t find Senior. Laine had lost her father. In the house!</p><p>She could hear him softly calling for his wife, for Janice, but she couldn\u2019t find him. She went from room to room, calling, \u201cDad? Where are you, Dad?\u201d And just when she\u2019d start to get closer, he\u2019d be quiet. She had to enlist Mrs. Mulligrew\u2019s help and the two of them were racing all over the large, three-story, six-thousand-square-foot house. Laine wondered, who do you call when this happens? Do you dial 911? But he was here, somewhere....</p><p>She could hear him calling out, softly. \u201cJanice? Janice?\u201d</p><p>She called louder and louder, so afraid that he might hurt himself before she found him. She looked in closets, under beds, behind furniture, in the wine cellar and attic, her pulse racing. Then Mrs. Mulligrew said, \u201cShhhh. No more yelling. Just listening. He\u2019s afraid.\u201d</p> <p>So they prowled around, straining for a sound. It took an hour before they found him sitting on the floor inside a guest room shower. \u201cDad!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your mother got to?\u201d he asked. \u201cI could hear her but couldn\u2019t find her. I think she\u2019s sick. Is she sick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Dad, I think you took ten years off my life!\u201d</p><p>The three of them sat at the kitchen table and had a cup of tea and Laine\u2019s hands shook so much she could barely lift her cup. She\u2019d been in life-threatening situations without this much fear and shaking.</p><p>She called Eric three times that day; called Pax and Genevieve twice. But all her conversations were on the fly\u2014keeping tabs on her father at all times. It seemed an eternity before he laid down for a nap. She settled into Senior\u2019s den and fired up his computer, logging on to check her email. There was a note from Devon and she read it. Devon asked after Laine\u2019s family, her father, herself. She gave a little local news\u2014it sounded so boring! Laine felt tears sting her eyes\u2014she so longed for that life again. She missed Eric desperately; she missed her friends. She missed sleeping through the night without interruption, without getting up three or four times to make sure Senior was resting. And then Devon asked, Spencer and I are getting married, very quietly if we can get away with it. Will you be back in July? Will you be my maid of honor?</p><p>And Laine put her head down on the desk and sobbed. She hadn\u2019t cried like this since she was in high school. Not even when her mother passed away did she feel emotion this intense, this final.</p><p>\u201cHey, hey, hey,\u201d Genevieve said from the doorway. \u201cLainie, Lainie....\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head and wiped at her eyes. \u201cSorry,\u201d she muttered. \u201cIt\u2019s just...\u201d And the tears came again.</p> <p>Genevieve came into the room and sat on the edge of the desk. \u201cHe must\u2019ve really scared you,\u201d she said. \u201cBut he\u2019s all right now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know. But Gen, he\u2019s going to be like this for years. I thought I could make some arrangements for him, be sure he\u2019s safe and cared for and then I could...\u201d More tears flowed. \u201cI\u2019m never going to get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, darling, you will. If necessary, we\u2019ll find a safe and comfortable facility with specialists who can see he gets everything he needs.\u201d</p><p>She was shaking her head. \u201cAt least eighty percent of the time he\u2019s completely lucid. And when he is, he begs me not to put him in a home! How can I do that just so I can see the view, be with my friends, have Eric....\u201d She grabbed a tissue and blew her nose. \u201cI can\u2019t give up on him now. It would devastate him. And he\u2019s trying so hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaine, we\u2019re not going to let you give up your life for this. We\u2019ll find a way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck with that. I could never leave him and have nightmares about bad caregivers who lose track of him or steal from him or go out back to grab a joint!\u201d She bit a trembling lip. \u201cSometimes he\u2019s so scared.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve stroked her shoulder. \u201cListen to me. Most families make do with far fewer resources than we have. If you weren\u2019t here, what would Pax and I do? I imagine I\u2019d be running over here twice a day. Laine, this is terrific of you, but we do have to be realistic. Your parents kept your grandmother until it became impossible for them to work and raise a family with a patient in need of so much care and supervision in the house. There comes a time...\u201d</p><p>She nodded bravely. \u201cI know. But that time isn\u2019t here yet. He needs me. Someone has to be here, if not to watch him then to watch the caregivers!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so tired,\u201d Genevieve said. \u201cI\u2019m going to get you a glass of wine, then I\u2019m going to stay with you until you\u2019ve had a nap. We\u2019re going to talk about this when we\u2019re not all so afraid to do the wrong thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the girls? Don\u2019t you have to pick them up from school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call my sister. We help each other out with our kids when we can. Now come on, you need a break. I think you\u2019re just overwhelmed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m overwhelmed all right. But I\u2019m also beginning to see how hopeless this is. I just can\u2019t see the end....\u201d</p><p>Al made it as far as Seattle where he took on some part-time piecework on a loading dock at a big box store. There was no friend in need, of course. And he wouldn\u2019t be in Seattle long\u2014it was almost time to head for Iowa. He had a date with a tombstone and a bunch of flowers. He\u2019d get to see Carol, something he always looked forward to. That glimpse of her, once a year, was good for his heart. She was a fine woman who was aging delicately and sweetly. He was glad she had a good life.</p><p>Then he might head for Michigan. There was a trucking company there he liked. They always needed drivers because the work was hard and the pay not so great. But before he got on with his summer schedule, he called Eric.</p><p>\u201cHey, boss,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll be damned. You headed back to town by any chance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sorry. My buddy still needs me. His, ah, business is in a crunch and I\u2019m helping out. But how\u2019s things with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, considering...\u201d Eric said.</p><p>\u201cConsidering what?\u201d Al asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, Laine\u2019s stuck in Boston with her father. She had this idea she\u2019d take him home, fix him up with some good help and come back, but it\u2019s not working out that way. The family needs her there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you given any thoughts to going to Boston?\u201d</p><p>Eric laughed a little. \u201cI think about it all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not like you, Al. I put down roots. I like roots. I have a business and a daughter. Maybe some day, but not today. Lots of people depend on me and I\u2019m good with that. Not sure I\u2019m the best person for the job but it works for me to give it everything I\u2019ve got. That\u2019s the best I can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBet Laine depends on you, too,\u201d Al said.</p><p>\u201cShe does,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think this thing with her dad\u2019s illness hurts her heart. I can hear it when we talk. I can\u2019t move to Boston. But I am thinking about a visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Al said. \u201cThat\u2019s good. And how\u2019s that kid? Justin? How\u2019s he getting along?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s working mighty hard. He seems to be holding up all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe say anything about his brothers? And how they\u2019re doing in that foster home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, uh...he says that place isn\u2019t great. But he\u2019s got himself convinced that when he turns eighteen, everything will get back to normal and he\u2019ll have his brothers back. I tried to tell him it probably isn\u2019t going to be that simple, that easy, but he won\u2019t hear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it will be simple and easy....\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot likely. Justin is working eighty hours a week just to keep the wolf from the door. That doesn\u2019t leave a lot of time to parent, even if he really is just a big brother. The only thing that worries me... Well, it\u2019ll all work out the way it\u2019s supposed to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat worries you?\u201d Al asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing. Forget about it. Hey, that check you gave him, that was really nice of you, Al. I got him to open a bank account rather than cash it or carry it around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat worries you?\u201d Al asked again.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably nothing. He just said if he doesn\u2019t get custody right away when he\u2019s eighteen, he\u2019ll just get those boys out of that house. I told him not to get crazy\u2014I said talk to me first, maybe I can help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, I was real specific\u2014I said before you go and kidnap those boys in the dark of night, talk to me. It\u2019s probably just talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep an eye on him,\u201d Al said. \u201cHe\u2019s not a big talker, that one. Usually when he says something, he means it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m watching, Al. You doing all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Great. Fine. Maybe I\u2019ll get done sooner than later. With my friend\u2019s business...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know you\u2019ve always got a place here,\u201d Eric said.</p><p>\u201cAppreciate that,\u201d Al replied. \u201cTake care.\u201d And then he stared at the phone. It works for me to give it everything I\u2019ve got....</p><p>All Al had wanted since he was about nineteen years old was a second chance and if he was honest with himself, there had been a lot of them. But he never seized them. He was always too afraid of failing again, of not being good enough, of not measuring up. Yet this young man, Eric, was happy to be counted as the one trying hardest. And Justin, all seventeen years of him, would never quit. Never. And if Al gave in to his own fear and insecurity now, Justin could be lost. How much pride was a young man worth?</p><p>He packed up. He didn\u2019t bother collecting a final check from his employer. He checked out of his motel room and pointed the truck south. He wasn\u2019t sure this would turn out the way he wanted it to, but for the first time in almost a lifetime he was willing to gamble on himself.</p><p>When he had one hundred miles under his belt, he stopped for a sandwich and Coke. And he called Carol. \u201cHey,\u201d he said. \u201cListen, something came up. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not going to get home this summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay, Mick?\u201d she asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cYeah, fine.

On that little grave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, just some business. I was working with this kid. Young kid who\u2019s been trying to take care of a family and he\u2019s... He\u2019s only seventeen, Carol. I think he could use a hand. It\u2019ll mean staying put for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re going to help him,\u201d she said, her voice sweet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try. I might not be able to, but I owe it to him to try. I worry about you, though. Will you be okay if I don\u2019t make it back this summer?\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly. \u201cAl, it\u2019s been thirty-eight years and our Ethan has moved on. Time we did, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, if I could do it over...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMick, I wouldn\u2019t change a thing,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMick, my first love...I told you once, I\u2019ll tell you again, I\u2019ll always love you. There\u2019s a special place in my heart for you, the father of my lost child, the man I spent most of my youth loving and admiring. I treasured those years we had, you and me. So, we\u2019ve had our pain? Show me a human being who hasn\u2019t. We managed to somehow carry on, though it wasn\u2019t easy. We rebuilt our lives but we always have that wonderful bond. Thank you, Mick. You\u2019ve been so good to me and I do love you. I have wished for so many years that you would find true happiness. No one I know deserves it more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarol,\u201d he said with a catch in his voice.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve waited long enough,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll be sure that little grave is cared for. It\u2019s time for you to try something new. I\u2019ll be here if you need to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think maybe you\u2019re the best woman in the world,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cYou get going now,\u201d she said. \u201cI think you need to make up for lost time.\u201d</p><p>He might\u2019ve driven over the speed limit most of the way, but he wasn\u2019t stupid\u2014he was real careful. He just had this nagging fear that he\u2019d be too late, that in the two weeks he\u2019d been gone those people he cared about most had learned to hate him for leaving abruptly, no explanation, not even saying goodbye, not making contact.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to confront Justin in a public place so he decided to sit in front of his house until the boy came home from work. It was ten by the time he got to Thunder Point and the light on inside the little house suggested the boy was home already. Al took the duffel out of his truck and walked to the door. He knocked and the door opened right away.</p><p>Justin stood there in a pair of board shorts and that was all. His mouth was agog.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have left,\u201d Al said. \u201cI\u2019m back. I want to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Justin said.</p><p>\u201cI need a place to stay. I\u2019ll take the couch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust wait a minute here. I thought you\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do, all right?\u201d Al said. \u201cFirst of all, seems like whenever I feel like I could be more problem than solution I just hit the road. It always worked for me before. I couldn\u2019t let go of it this time\u2014I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about you working eighty hours, about Kevin\u2019s black eye, about that goddamn shrew who calls herself a foster mother and those lazy idiots laying around waiting for someone else to do the chores. I wanted to let it go, but it wouldn\u2019t go. But here\u2019s the deal\u2014no matter how hard I try, the program probably wouldn\u2019t have me as a foster parent. I don\u2019t have that much going for me. For starters, I\u2019m pretty sure I can\u2019t even fill out the paperwork.\u201d</p><p>Justin grinned. \u201cI\u2019ve seen your paperwork,\u201d he said. \u201cPathetic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well I\u2019ve never been good at that stuff but the way I see it, we gotta give it a shot. We can go together and I can\u2019t think of a reason they wouldn\u2019t let you help with it. I don\u2019t have a record or anything. I make okay money and have a little savings. I won\u2019t be able to help with homework but you can. Between us, we can keep the boys clean and dry and fed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously? You don\u2019t have to. I\u2019m going to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, you\u2019re going to do it all. Listen, kid, I\u2019m not feeling guilty or anything, that\u2019s not what this is. This is something I can do. I think it will make me happy.\u201d</p><p>Justin shifted his weight to one leg. \u201cYeah? And what if you get in it and find out you\u2019re not so happy? Then what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it doesn\u2019t look like it, but I can keep my word. If you boys don\u2019t turn into total juvenile delinquents, I can get you grown up.\u201d He paused a minute. \u201cI want to, Justin. I\u2019m not the best choice, but I\u2019m adequate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI think we should go to the DHS office tomorrow. The sooner we get this rolling, the sooner we go pick up the boys and get \u2019em home.\u201d</p><p>Justin thought on this for a minute. Then he said, \u201cOkay. You can have the couch. And listen, if you don\u2019t come through for me, I can take it. But if you get those boys\u2019 hopes up and let \u2019em down, I\u2019ll get even. I swear to God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfectly fair,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I have a favor to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want the two thousand back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. I want you to find me a pillow and blanket. I gotta go somewhere and I don\u2019t know how long this is gonna take. I have to go knock on Ray Anne\u2019s door. I have lots of amends to make and I bet she\u2019s really pissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell her you were leaving, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re brilliant, kid. I really like that woman, but she\u2019s not going to be happy and I don\u2019t blame her. You have any advice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cDuck.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-One</p><p>It took Ray Anne a while to answer her front door, though there was a light on inside. It took Al only a moment to assess\u2014she had her hair wrapped in a pink cloth, tied in a bow on top of her head. She had no eyebrows. In fact, no eyelashes that he could see. She was wearing yellow silk pajamas, little feathery slippers, with heels, her face was greasy and she wore white gloves on her hands. Her mouth formed an O when she saw him. And then she slammed the door in his face.</p><p>So, this wasn\u2019t going to be easy.</p><p>He stood there for a minute, thinking. Then he tried the door and of course it was locked. He walked around the side of the house and let himself into the garage through the side door\u2014not locked. The door into the kitchen wasn\u2019t locked and he walked in. She was standing in the middle of the living room and the house was very small so she saw him enter and shrieked. Her fists were clenched at her sides and her eyes were the size of hubcaps.</p><p>He thought she was the cutest little thing.</p><p>He took two long steps toward her, slipped his arms around her waist and lifted her off her little pink slippers and planted a big one on her mouth. He kept his lips there until her arms went reluctantly around his neck. After drowning her in a generous and passionate kiss for a full minute, he slid his mouth free of hers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispered against her lips. \u201cThat was awful of me, leaving like I did. You don\u2019t have to forgive me, but I\u2019ll never do that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bull,\u201d she said. \u201cYou probably just want sex!\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cWell, yes, I do, as a matter of fact. But that\u2019s not why I came back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree reasons. I like it here. I like you. I want to see if I can do anything to help those Russell boys. They could use someone on their team right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp them how?\u201d she asked, reaching a hand up to adjust her head gear and bow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to apply to be a foster parent. They\u2019re in a bad place right now and Justin can\u2019t do it without help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said, clearly let down.</p><p>\u201cIf I live and work here, I can see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re a father you won\u2019t see that much of me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cCome on, of course I will. They\u2019re teenagers. They need supervision\u2014they don\u2019t have to be rocked and burped. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get a hall pass when I want one. I missed you, Ray. We work real well together. We have some good talks, some great laughs. You\u2019re a damn good woman and we hit it off. I\u2019d be a fool to let you get away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good you want to help some kids but really, if the kids didn\u2019t need you, would you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome back to you? I think so, yes. I\u2019ve been stuck in a sorry old pattern for a long, long time. I wanted to get on with my life better than I had. Be warned\u2014I\u2019m not that smart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very smart,\u201d she said. \u201cOne of the smartest men I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sucking up,\u201d he said with a raised brow and a half smile.</p><p>\u201cOh, sure.\u201d She laughed. \u201cWhat\u2019s that going to get me? You can\u2019t even fit in my car. And you have now officially seen me at my worst.\u201d</p><p>He lowered his lips and gave her a small kiss. \u201cI told you before, I think you\u2019re pretty. Can we be made up now? Because I don\u2019t have many tricks in my old bag of tricks and I\u2019d have to go ask that seventeen-year-old for advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want one thing,\u201d she said. \u201cI want you to learn to call in advance. I want eyebrows at our next rendezvous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want my oath that I\u2019ll never leave without saying goodbye again?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou do that again, cowboy, and it\u2019s the last time you come back to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a tough woman, Ray. I like that.\u201d</p><p>Laine and Senior sat on opposite sides of his desk playing an early morning game of Scrabble. He\u2019d lost his edge; some things just didn\u2019t come to him with the speed that he once possessed, but he was holding his own pretty well. He made a few mistakes, some of his words weren\u2019t words, but he\u2019d had a good couple of days. Just a few forays into the abyss. He often asked for his wife and Laine had learned not to tell him she was dead\u2014it was as if the grief was fresh and new each time. She just said she wasn\u2019t home. \u201cExcellent,\u201d she said of the game. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever beat you at Scrabble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave you an advantage,\u201d he said. \u201cI should get a handicap.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him. \u201cOne more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said, letting her mix up the little letters again. \u201cLaine, I\u2019m sorry. I think I said it already, but I\u2019m sorry. For everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I was a terrible father. And now I\u2019m a terrible father and you\u2019re stuck with me.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed his hand. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this but we\u2019ve had some very good times the past several weeks\u2014some good talks. I don\u2019t feel stuck. I wonder, if you didn\u2019t have this curse of a condition, if we\u2019d ever have gotten to know each other this well.\u201d She leaned across the desk and kissed his cheek. \u201cI\u2019m glad I can be with you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to leave soon,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour work,\u201d he said. \u201cI know you love your work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. That. Well, you\u2019re right\u2014I have loved it. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going back into that line of work...I haven\u2019t resigned yet. I meant to, but then life kind of intruded. I think I\u2019m finished. I\u2019m going to make it official pretty soon.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet for a moment. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say. Because of me?\u201d he asked. \u201cIs this because of me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cWhile I was in Oregon I was doing a little consulting work for the county\u2014background checks, looking for people who had skipped bond or owed money. It was more field work than just computer searches and it wasn\u2019t bad. Actually, I kind of liked it. More of a place-holder than career field, but it works for me.... I\u2019m getting that damn commendation, though,\u201d she added, straightening and lifting her chin. \u201cI earned it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll be there,\u201d he said. And then, deflating slightly, he added, \u201cUnless I embarrass you...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019d like to go, I\u2019ll take you,\u201d she said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cAnything could happen, you know,\u201d he informed her. \u201cI could forget where I am. I could pee in your boss\u2019s wastepaper basket. I could cry or babble or think you\u2019re my wife and not my daughter....\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want to go, I\u2019ll take you. I\u2019d be very proud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be proud, too\u2014maybe I could go with you,\u201d Pax said from the doorway. He was dressed in scrubs, as though he\u2019d just made an escape from the hospital. He leaned in the doorway and smiled. \u201cMaybe the whole family will go and make a reunion of it?\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she asked, standing.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re here for a little chat,\u201d he said. At just that moment, Genevieve came up behind him, putting her hands on Pax\u2019s upper arms and smiling her most gentle smile. And then Mrs. Mulligrew joined them in the doorway. \u201cAnd to deliver this,\u201d he said, holding an envelope toward her.</p><p>Laine reached for the envelope and found a couple of boarding passes inside. The first was from Boston to Seattle, the second was a small commuter that would take her North Bend, just an hour from Thunder Point. \u201cThis flight is today. I can\u2019t leave,\u201d she said. \u201cSenior needs me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit down, Lainie. This was Dad\u2019s suggestion. We\u2019ve got it all taken care of,\u201d Pax said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s taken care of?\u201d Senior asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, see, whatever scheme this is, it\u2019s not going to work. I can\u2019t leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit down, Lainie,\u201d Genevieve said. \u201cWe\u2019ll explain, you throw a few things into a suitcases or two and head for home. Where your heart is. Literally.\u201d</p> <p>After they all explained their idea for Senior\u2019s care, though it sounded well-planned, she was still reluctant. \u201cWhat if this doesn\u2019t work?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll work\u2014we\u2019re all on board. And if we have to make adjustments, we\u2019ll make adjustments,\u201d Pax said. \u201cDad?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cDad, if you don\u2019t want me to go, I won\u2019t go,\u201d Laine said.</p><p>\u201cLainie, I don\u2019t want it to be so long until you come home again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAnd I want to go to that award thing. Where is it? Is it far?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and felt tears come. \u201cIt\u2019s not far. And I want you to be there, Dad.\u201d She gave him a kiss on the cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll see you very soon.\u201d</p><p>At first there was barely enough time to text or call Eric. Her first opportunity was when she was waiting for her plane to board and that\u2019s when she thought that surprising him would be so wonderful. After all, she\u2019d only known for a couple of hours herself. But Eric being Eric might get a little worried if he couldn\u2019t reach her and he did have phone numbers for Senior\u2019s house and Pax\u2019s cell phone. So she texted him that she was very busy, company at the house, lots going on and would call later. Possibly it would be late. She could get in to Thunder Point via rental car before 9:00 p.m.</p> <p>She relaxed.</p><p>While Pax was taking her suitcases to the cab, he told her that Senior had called him. \u201cHe said something like, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without Laine right now, but I can\u2019t have her devote her life to my illness. Do something. Work something out. Find some help so she feels she can leave. Of course, he would remember saying that for about ten minutes, but he was both lucid and earnest at the time.\u201d</p><p>And the solution was right under their noses. When Pax asked Mrs. Mulligrew if she knew of anyone who could serve as a live-in attendant she said, \u201cMe and my husband would do it. We kept his auntie Borgia when she was infirm. We kept her for seven years. We know our way around some old folks. And we have the help of the kids. They\u2019ve been helping us for years. I\u2019d have offered sooner but I was thinkin\u2019 you wanted some licensed folks who wear white....\u201d Licensed folks who wore white? One of the Mulligrew sons was an EMT, another was a school teacher, their daughter had been going back to college post-divorce to study social work.</p><p>It was interesting to Laine that she could take on a case of human trafficking or domestic terrorism and go through the steps, line up the evidence, secure a warrant, go undercover or tap a line and yet when it came to nursing care for her own father, she felt completely helpless. Mrs. Mulligrew and her husband had been like a part of the family for years! When Janice Carrington had been so ill, Mrs. Mulligrew was always close at hand in case she was needed. When there were heavy jobs she couldn\u2019t manage alone, like moving furniture for painters or paperhangers, her grown children were glad to help for the extra income. Mr. and Mrs. Mulligrew had been dependable house sitters for many years.</p><p>At the moment, the Mulligrews\u2019 divorced daughter and her three children were living in their home, trying to get back on their feet, and Mrs. Mulligrew said she and her husband would be more than happy to move in with Dr. Carrington and keep an eye on things. They\u2019d still need some home nursing help, \u201cBut you can be sure there won\u2019t be no pot smoking in the backyard, Lainie,\u201d she said.</p><p>Why Laine had not seen this potential solution, she wasn\u2019t sure. Maybe just the fact that she was inexperienced in this. Or maybe it was her terrible fear of making a mistake with her father\u2019s care. It appeared things might work. Surely there would be issues now and again, interruptions in their routines, but Pax and Genevieve and Laine and Eric could live their lives for the most part.</p><p>It was a very long day of flying. It seemed forever before she saw the town and she had to concentrate not to burn rubber all the way to her house. She was not surprised that it was dark\u2014Eric always worked late, especially when she was not around. She was fine with that\u2014she\u2019d light the place up! She dragged her suitcases inside and began asking herself\u2014shall I let him find me on the deck with a fire? In the tub? Maybe just naked in the bed...</p><p>But something was wrong. She wasn\u2019t sure what it was, but she couldn\u2019t smell him. She couldn\u2019t smell his aftershave or his last meal. Everything smelled like fresh cleaning supplies. She turned on lights and it was shiny clean, not so much as a speck of dust or smear of glass cleaner\u2014but the house was so empty. No shoes on the stairs waiting to be carried up to the closet. No towels on the washer waiting for the next load. And no dishes in the dishwasher?</p><p>Reluctantly, filled with trepidation, she went to the master bedroom. Again, so tidy. Eric was orderly and neat, but vacuum tracks on the carpet? She went to the closet and... Oh. My. God. One lone winter shirt hung there. A couple of wool trousers kept it company. Her heart hammering, she flew into the bathroom and opened the cupboard beneath the sink. His shaving kit was gone. His toothbrush stood stoically alone in the toothbrush caddy.</p><p>Gone? Without a word?</p><p>A million possibilities shot through her mind, none of them good. Had he found himself a house he preferred? One he liked better? Was he seeing someone? Someone who, like she had, was collecting one piece of his clothing at a time? But why had he never mentioned he didn\u2019t live here? Why hadn\u2019t he said...?</p><p>Her first instinct was to call him and ask him what was going on, but she\u2019d become too sneaky as an agent; wherever he was now living, she intended to catch him there. And she felt a need to look into those beautiful green eyes for the truth. Instead of calling, she left the rental car in the drive and walked the few short blocks to his station, which was still lit up. She recognized Al, pumping gas and cleaning off a windshield. She\u2019d heard from Eric that Al had left, that he had returned....</p><p>\u201cLaine!\u201d Al said, grabbing her in his big bearlike embrace. \u201cWhen did you get here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a little while ago, but I can\u2019t find Eric,\u201d she said. \u201cAl, please be straight with me\u2014where is he?\u201d</p><p>Al seemed to get a pained look on his face and ran a hand nervously around the back of his neck, a wince on his face. \u201cHoney, he doesn\u2019t talk about it, but I\u2019ve seen him heading in the direction of the Coastline. I sent him home early tonight\u2014I told him I\u2019d lock up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked. \u201cOh, Al, is there a woman there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine that, honey. When I checked out of the Coastline, I think he kept that room he used to live in. He didn\u2019t say anything to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI talked to him three or four times a day,\u201d she said, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t say you were coming back today....\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t know,\u201d she said. She sniffed and lifted her chin. \u201cI guess I should go find out what Mr. Lucky does when he\u2019s off work. At the Coastline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Laine...\u201d</p><p>She turned and regarded him coolly. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelcome home,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d And then she walked away.</p><p>It was a short walk to the motel. There were more cars there than she usually saw, but that might be due to the start of summer. She knew the room number and knew that Eric had never kept a car there. His three vehicles\u2014two classics and his SUV\u2014took up residence at the station. She knocked on the door, ready to get to the bottom of this. Although her instincts told her there had never been any reason to suspect Eric of anything wrong, there was a tiny part of her ready to see a floozy with bad roots in a push-up bra and garter belt.... She wasn\u2019t sure where he would find one of those, but\u2014</p><p>\u201cJust a sec,\u201d he yelled.</p><p>Hiding the floozy under the bed...</p><p>He threw the door open and the shock on his face was absolutely carved in stone. Pale, hard stone. His green eyes glittered, his mouth dropped open, he was frozen motionless as if trying to figure out if she was real. And then suddenly he grabbed her, pulled her hard against him, buried his mouth in her neck and groaned, \u201cLaine,\u201d in a throaty whisper. \u201cGod, Laine.\u201d He pulled her into the room, kicked the door closed and held her so tight she could barely breathe. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVisiting,\u201d she gasped out. \u201cEric, what are you doing here? You moved out of our house!\u201d She pulled back a little bit, enough to look at his eyes. \u201cYou took everything and moved out! Why? Are you done with us? Are you seeing someone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked. Then he laughed and picked her up, whirled her around and threw her on the bed, then pounced on top of her. \u201cAnother woman?\u201d he asked. \u201cOh, you ruined that option for me a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you here?\u201d she asked again. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2014it was too big. Too quiet. If I\u2019d known you were coming today, I would\u2019ve gotten my stuff back in there and waited for you. It was hard to be there alone\u2014it was just too...\u201d And he shrugged.</p><p>\u201cBut, Eric, I told you I\u2019d be back!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot lately, you didn\u2019t. It seemed like every time I talked to you your dad\u2019s condition got more complicated and the help you needed further out of reach. I didn\u2019t want you worrying about me, too, so I just slowly moved back in here. I didn\u2019t really mean to, but...I went home, though. Almost every day. But when I slept there...\u201d He shook his head. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the same place without you. Especially late at night...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cEric, you should\u2019ve told me. When I saw your things were gone, I thought the worst.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I understood about your father and brother. It wasn\u2019t something you planned but after all the torment of dealing with a father who seemed to never approve of you, you had him back. I knew how important that was and there was so little time for you to repair things with him. You had to do what you had to do. I didn\u2019t want you to regret anything.\u201d He brushed back her hair. \u201cYou had to know I was willing to wait as long as I had to wait. I just didn\u2019t want to be there without you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been gone overnight before,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThis was different. There was no end in sight. Let\u2019s go now\u2014we\u2019ll go back there tonight. Let me grab a shirt for tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop. Do you have a woman hidden in the closet or bathroom or something?\u201d</p><p>He laughed at her. He rolled with her until she was on top of him. \u201cLaine, there could never be anyone else for me. I love you. I say it every day. I show you when I can. How long can you visit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForever,\u201d she said. \u201cBut only if the life I want is here. I know this will come as a shock, but I\u2019m not here for the view.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cForever?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhat about your dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother and the housekeeper came up with a good plan for him. I\u2019m going to visit him often, of course. I\u2019ll try to get back there every month for a few days, but I want to live here. I can handle his finances from here. Don\u2019t panic. I\u2019m not going to force you into a commitment or anything....\u201d</p><p>He smiled into her eyes. \u201cI was afraid you wouldn\u2019t be able to come back. Not that you wouldn\u2019t want to, but that you couldn\u2019t. And I couldn\u2019t stay in that house alone because you were everywhere. I could see you on the deck, in the kitchen, in the bed. I could see you in that chair you like to read in. I could feel you curling into me when I was on the couch. I missed you so much, wanted you so much, I couldn\u2019t sleep, couldn\u2019t think. I\u2019d dream we were together\u2014I could taste you sometimes. You conquered me the first day I saw you and once I let you inside my little protective armor, you took me down. I\u2019ve loved you since the first time I kissed you and I\u2019ll never love another woman. I can barely remember when I didn\u2019t love you and I don\u2019t think anyone on earth has ever had a love like this. I\u2019m blind and deaf and helpless without you. I\u2019m wearing pajamas again. I hate wearing pajamas. I\u2019m a pathetic shell of a man who lives for one woman and I don\u2019t even want to sleep in our bed unless I\u2019m sure you\u2019re coming back to it. And I\u2019d do anything for you. If you weren\u2019t able to come back, I would\u2019ve come to you. If you wanted me. Because really, there has never been a woman in my life, in my whole life, that I could feel in my sleep. That I could taste and hear and smell and feel. You\u2019re inside me and I love you. I will love you forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Eric,\u201d she said, touching his face, her eyes glistening. \u201cYou\u2019re not afraid that I\u2019ll stay gone anymore, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. And if you have to leave again, I won\u2019t let that question hang in the air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that means there\u2019s no hooker in the closet?\u201d</p> <p>He grinned. It was clear he knew she couldn\u2019t for one second believe he could be with anyone else, ever. \u201cYou\u2019ll like her. She\u2019s nice. Sweet girl, just trying to earn a little money to afford her Ph.D. in psychology. She was looking specifically for screwed-up clients.\u201d He grabbed her arms and gave her a little shake. \u201cLaine, all I want is you. Us. Together. Even if we have to be apart, I want to know we\u2019re together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEric, I thought about us every day. Every minute of every day. I just have one question for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cCan I use your toothbrush?\u201d</p><p>He kissed her. \u201cYou can have any part of me. But I want to go home. And in the morning I\u2019ll get Manny to take care of the station and you can help me move back into the house. Our house. Our bed. Where I\u2019ll stay.\u201d</p><p>She lifted an eyebrow. \u201cOne shirt at a time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis time I think we\u2019ll clean this place out. I\u2019ll give the key back to the management.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all in this time?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d he said. \u201cHere\u2019s the deal. If you promise not to doubt me anymore, I promise to never again doubt you. How\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. I want to pin you down. When I turn my back you get a little slippery....\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore, baby. I\u2019m all yours.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
