It seemed to reach out with a sweet, alluring warmth. At the source there seemed to be beckoning shadows, but though Leslie MacIntyre could see nothing clearly, they seemed to offer comfort, as well, as if they were waiting to welcome her, to enfold her into their loving arms.</p><p>\u201cHey, you!\u201d</p> <p>The voice was husky, affectionate, yet strangely jarring. She looked up. It was Matt. She didn\u2019t know where they were, but so long as she and Matt Connolly were together, everything was all right.</p><p>They\u2019d met when she\u2019d been the new kid on the block. Though he was a few years older, he\u2019d pulled her along in his wake and made her one of his crowd. He\u2019d called her Rebel, but he\u2019d done it in such a teasing tone that no one had ever been able to use it against her. He\u2019d mocked her Southern accent, then announced that it was the most charming thing he\u2019d ever heard. She\u2019d practically worshipped him over the years, then\u2014yes, she could admit it\u2014lusted after him as they\u2019d grown older. Strangely, it was a tragedy that had made her hopes and dreams come true, that had suddenly made him realize the girl he had befriended had grown up. And since then...</p><p>The years hadn\u2019t all been perfect. They\u2019d been quite a thing once she\u2019d graduated from high school, but their pride had sometimes gotten the best of them. One tempestuous blowup had led to a breakup, sending him to college in another state far to the south to play football, while she, still his Rebel, had stayed behind in Yankee territory, opting for NYU. Despite a year in the pros post-college, he\u2019d gone on to journalism, while she had chosen urban archaeology, specializing in her own adopted home of New York. He had started in sports but gone on to world affairs, then come home to write a column about life and issues in New York City.</p><p>Back in New York, he had found her again\u2014digging in the dirt, he joked. For months, they had both been cautious, dying to see each other, afraid of the intensity of the emotion that still roiled between them. One night he had simply shown up at her door at 3:00 a.m. and sanity flew to the wind. They\u2019d immediately gotten engaged, and now they were planning a wedding.</p><p>Oddly enough, their lives together had added to both their careers. He\u2019d done some of his very best pieces for the paper\u2014a man\u2019s take on the modern wedding. Through Matt, Leslie had been drawn into conversation with a detective about an elderly man who had gone missing. She knew the area in Brooklyn where he had disappeared, which was filled with old subway tunnels. Asking the detective to humor her, she had led him to the place where the man had ended his days.</p> <p>She\u2019d felt almost as if she\u2019d been beckoned to the site, though she argued with herself that knowledge and logic had brought her to the place. But now many detectives found her very interesting, and Matt had warned her that they were thinking about asking her to use her extraordinary knowledge of the city and its infrastructure to help with a new spate of disappearances. Matt himself was taking the matter very seriously and writing about it for the paper. People constantly disappeared in New York, of course. But these disappearances seemed to be linked. The missing were all women who lived on the streets. And they were all prostitutes.</p><p>Matt had pointed out that, throughout history, neither the police nor the populace had seemed to care about the fate of those who lived in the underbelly of society.</p><p>The moral majority never worried too much until it was threatened itself.</p><p>She could tell that Matt wanted her to get involved, though she seriously doubted she could be of any help. She wished she could, but she couldn\u2019t suddenly claim to be some kind of clairvoyant.</p><p>And she had her real work, which she believed was important, and which she loved.</p><p>And which had brought them here. Here? Where exactly were they now?</p> <p>They\u2019d started the evening in the newly renovated Hastings House, at a fund-raiser so the historical foundation that employed her could continue excavating the neighboring site. There was a field of architectural gold to be explored there, and her employer was thrilled to have such an eloquent columnist as Matt Connolly on their side while they battled a major construction company for the right to do research before everything was destroyed for the sake of a new high-rise.</p><p>But as for actually being with Matt tonight...They\u2019d barely had a chance to say hello.</p><p>A number of representatives were there from the development company that had bought the surrounding property\u2014trying to pretend that they were delighted to plan around the historical significance of the place\u2014along with Greta Peterson, socialite and ambassador for the Historical Society, a few Broadway personalities, some local celebrities and more. Hank Smith, of megadeveloper Tyson, Smith and Tryon, had swooped down on Matt the minute they\u2019d entered the place, hoping to sway Matt\u2019s opinion to the firm\u2019s side. There were police representatives, including Captain Ken Dryer, the charismatic department spokesman, Sergeant Robert Adair\u2014who was in charge of the investigation into the missing prostitutes and was actually watching her with brooding contemplation most of the night\u2014and politicians from the five boroughs.</p><p>She\u2019d been across the room from Matt, exchanging pleasantries with a colleague.</p><p>She\u2019d just excused herself to go to Matt and then...</p><p>What?</p><p>He was hunkered down beside her now just as he had been when a football struck her in the head when they were playing in the streets so many years ago. He offered the same smile he\u2019d given her then, full of interest and amusement toward most situations, a dry smile. Even a bit rueful, as if, in the end, there was little to do but mock himself.</p><p>\u201cMatt,\u201d she murmured, frowning, wondering why she couldn\u2019t remember crossing the room to his side. And what was she doing on the floor? \u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m here,\u201d he murmured. \u201cFor just this moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust this moment?\u201d she queried. She wanted to reach out and touch his face. Damn, but he\u2019d always been gorgeous. In a manly, rugged way, of course. Steady blue eyes, generous mouth, broad forehead, high cheekbones. Tall and in shape, he was the guy everyone would have hated if he hadn\u2019t been so damned decent. So men liked him, and women loved him.</p><p>Despite her confusion, she felt herself rise and turn toward the light. It had the most incredible power. She couldn\u2019t resist it. She felt that it offered release from pain, from doubt.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Matt said softly as he caught her arm. Or was that just her imagination? She turned her attention back to him, confused. She could no longer hear the string quartet that had been playing that evening. From a far distant place, she thought she heard screams and chaos.</p><p>\u201cSilly Rebel,\u201d he said softly, as he had so many times when she was growing up. \u201cYou have to stay here. You can\u2019t go yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s going to stop me, Matt Connolly?\u201d she demanded. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your time,\u201d he said. \u201cLeslie, there are things you need to do. You are not to follow the light,\u201d he said firmly.</p><p>\u201cHey, are you holding out on me?\u201d she demanded lightly, looking around and seeing people getting up and moving single-file toward the light. \u201cMatt, I\u2019m with you. We\u2019re together. I have to get in line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all in line, in a way, from day one,\u201d he said very softly. \u201cBut not you, not now. You have to stay here. Some things are meant to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome things are meant to be?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cSome things are meant to be,\u201d he said firmly.</p><p>He squeezed her hand, and heat shot through her.</p><p>Then it felt as if she were jolted. As if they were interrupted.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d a deep voice called. \u201cThis one is alive!\u201d</p><p>It was as if she were watching a movie, but she was in it. There was a horrible scent in the air, as if something were burning. People were everywhere, running, shouting.</p><p>There had been an explosion, she thought. Someone had screamed something about gas, and then a blast had seemed to rock the world. Yes! She could remember it now, the feeling of being lifted, of flying...slamming hard against a wall. But...she wasn\u2019t lying against a wall.</p><p>She was looking down on a scene of absolute chaos. And she was in it. She was lying in a row of sleeping people. She couldn\u2019t recognize any of them. Matt...where was Matt? Emergency personnel were moving purposefully through the chaos, imposing order. The newly painted walls of the room were blackened and scorched. There had been a blast and a fire. Everything pointed to it.</p><p>And she hurt! Oh, God, she ached everywhere, she thought, back in her body, no longer looking down on the carnage. The scent of charred wood...worse, the scent of charred flesh, filled her nostrils.</p><p>Because the people she was aligned with were not sleeping.</p><p>They were dead.</p><p>She could see the open, glazed eyes of the woman beside her. Suddenly she realized that a man was hunkered down by her side. And it wasn\u2019t Matt.</p><p>\u201cThis one is alive!\u201d the man yelled.</p><p>Of course I\u2019m alive, she thought.</p><p>There was sudden confusion. People rushing over to her. More shouting.</p><p>\u201cQuick, or we\u2019ll lose her! Her pulse is fading.\u201d</p><p>More people started rushing around her.</p><p>\u201cClear!\u201d</p><p>There was a fire in her chest.</p><p>Every bone in her body seemed to be in raw agony. She knew she needed to open her eyes, to take a breath.</p><p>She blinked. The lights blazing all around her were the false and neon glitter of night.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got her! She\u2019s back.\u201d</p><p>Then she was being lifted onto something soft and flat. She was dimly aware that someone was talking to the man at her side. Her vision of the scene around her suddenly seemed acute and agonizing.</p><p>There were four bodies against the wall. And one of them was Matt.</p><p>Then there was no light, no confusion. Just the horrible knowledge.</p><p>Matt was dead.</p><p>She started to scream....</p><p>\u201cCalm down,\u201d a medic said. \u201cPlease...You\u2019re alive, and we want to keep you that way.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Alive? Then Matt...</p><p>\u201cPlease, you\u2019ve got to help Matt. He\u2019s alive. I was just talking to him. You\u2019ve got to help him!\u201d</p><p>She saw the distress in the medic\u2019s eyes.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry...\u201d</p><p>She was in the midst of hell on earth, she realized.</p><p>Matt...</p><p>She was vaguely aware of a needle in her arm.</p><p>Then there was only darkness.</p> <p>1</p><p>One year later</p><p>L eslie paused for a minute, looking skyward. What a beautiful evening it was. The sky couldn\u2019t have been a lovelier shade of violet. But then, the countryside in northern Virginia was some of the most beautiful in the world.</p><p>More so than ever before, at least to her.</p><p>In the past year, she had come to appreciate such simple thing as the colors of life. It had been such a strange year, filled with vividly conflicting emotions. The touch of the sun, the color of a dawn, seemed more intense than ever. The anguish of learning to live alone still interrupted the newfound beauty. Life had become doubly precious, except that she felt it was such an incredible gift that it should be shared...yet she was alive and Matt was dead.</p><p>The setting sun was beautiful, and the night breeze sweet and soft. With that thought in mind, she closed her eyes and felt the waning brush of day against her cheeks. The warmth was wonderful.</p> <p>She sighed, then returned to work. She needed to hurry. The light would be gone soon.</p><p>Painstakingly, bit by bit, she brushed away the dust covering the recently revealed area. She removed the last few specks, and then...</p><p>Yes!</p><p>She continued to brush away the dirt from the skull fragment in the crevice, feeling a sense of jubilation. She couldn\u2019t be certain, of course, not absolutely, but it looked like they had discovered the old St. Mathias graveyard that Professor David Laymon had been certain was here. She eyed the skull for size and shape. Bones weren\u2019t her specialty. She knew objects, fabrics, even architecture, all the things that made up life, backward and forward. She knew bones only because she had come across them in her work so often.</p><p>The fragments of calico by the skull hinted at a type of hair decoration that fit perfectly with Laymon\u2019s belief that this section of the graveyard had been reserved for indentured servants, slaves and those who were simply too poor to pay for anything better.</p><p>\u201cBrad!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>Brad Verdun, her good friend and colleague, was busy working a few yards away. As she waited for his attention, she took her tweezers and carefully collected the bits of fabric she had discovered; a lab analysis would verify her thoughts, she was certain, but every little shred needed to be preserved.</p> <p>\u201cBrad!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d At last he dusted his hands and rose, then walked to where she was working. He swore softly, shaking his head. \u201cYou were right. Again.\u201d He stared at her a little skeptically. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t know you so well, I just might agree with everyone else that you\u2019re psychic.\u201d</p><p>She smiled a little uneasily. \u201cYou would have chosen the same spot yourself,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, eventually.\u201d He looked across the work site, staring at the professor, who was down on his hands and knees about fifty yards away. \u201cWell, princess of the past, announce your discovery. Give the old boy his thrill for the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou found the bones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe work together,\u201d she said modestly. \u201cYou were just a few feet away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made the discovery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe came as a team, a package deal,\u201d she reminded him stubbornly.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t take your credit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to take the credit! Please?\u201d</p><p>He sighed deeply. \u201cAll right, all right. I\u2019ll bring him over. But I won\u2019t lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not lying if you say we found it as a team,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>He stared at her for a moment, then touched the top of her head with gentle affection. \u201cOkay. You want to stay out of the limelight, kiddo, I\u2019ll do my best to help you. For a while, anyway.\u201d Like a brother, he stroked her cheek, giving her an encouraging smile.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she murmured softly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be okay. You\u2019re coming along just great,\u201d he said.</p><p>She nodded, looking down.</p><p>Was she? A year had gone by. She functioned, yes, but she continued to hurt every day. Work was good. Friends were good.</p><p>Nights were torture.</p><p>And life itself...</p><p>Was definitely different. That difference had become clear while she\u2019d still been in the hospital after the explosion. If she hadn\u2019t happened to pick up a magazine and seen the article on Adam Harrison and Harrison Investigations...</p><p>Well, she would probably either be dead now\u2014having scared herself into an early grave\u2014or in a mental hospital. Adam Harrison and his team, especially Nikki Blackhawk, had undoubtedly saved both her life and her sanity. But that was information she shared with no one. Not Brad, and certainly not Professor Laymon.</p><p>She watched as Brad walked over to talk to Laymon. Brad was definitely a good guy, the best. If she\u2019d had a brother, he couldn\u2019t have been better to her. Years ago, when they had first started working together, she\u2019d known that he wanted more of a relationship, but no one was ever going to stand a chance against Matt. And in fact, he\u2019d liked Matt so much himself that they\u2019d all fallen into a great friendship. She hesitated, watching Brad, glad that nothing had changed, that he had kept a brotherly distance from her and given his full support without any indication that his affections could turn sexual. She knew she would never feel any differently about him; there came a point in life where someone was a friend and that would never change. Brad was tall, well muscled, patient, intelligent and fun. The perfect guy\u2014for someone else. The great thing about their friendship was that they shared their love of what they did. Some of the first enjoyment she had felt since the explosion that had killed Matt had been because of Brad, because of the excitement in his dark and arresting eyes when they made a discovery.</p><p>In large part thanks to him, sometimes, she could even have fun these days, going for drinks or dinner after work. His presence kept other guys away, but if he wanted to start something up with someone else, she didn\u2019t get in the way.</p><p>They had worked well together before the accident.</p><p>Now she relied on him more than ever\u2014even if she was the one who usually \u201csaw\u201d the past more clearly and homed in on a location with eerily perfect accuracy. Sometimes he eyed her almost warily, but when she shrugged, he let it alone.</p><p>She watched as Laymon listened to Brad. His face lit up as if the sun had risen again purely to shine down on him. He was up in a flash, hurrying to Leslie\u2019s side, shouting excitedly and bringing the rest of the team\u2014teachers, students and volunteers\u2014in his wake. \u201cWatch where you walk,\u201d he cautioned. \u201cWe don\u2019t want all this work trampled.\u201d Hopping over one of the plastic lines set out to protect the dig and provide the grid that allowed them to map their finds, he seemed like a little kid, he was so happy.</p><p>He stared at Leslie, eyebrows raised questioningly, then looked down at the skull she\u2019d uncovered before turning back to her again. A broad smile lit his worn features. He pushed his Ben Franklin bifocals up the bridge of his nose and scratched his white-bearded chin. If anyone had ever looked the part of a professor, it was David Laymon. \u201cYou\u2019ve done it,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve done it,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll uncover the rest of the skeleton in the morning, then get it to the folks at the Smithsonian...right away, right away. It\u2019s too late to work anymore tonight, but we need to secure this area before we go, then get back to work first thing in the morning. From now on we\u2019ll need speed\u2014and real care. Leslie, I could hug you. I will hug you!\u201d He drew her to her feet, hugged her, then kissed her on the cheek. She was suffused with color, a blush staining her cheeks, as a burst of applause sounded from all around them.</p><p>\u201cHey, please,\u201d she protested. \u201cWe\u2019re all in on this, and Brad was the one to cordon off this particular area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill, what a find,\u201d Professor Laymon murmured. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to speak to the press. This is big excitement for this area...for historians everywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she said softly, firmly, \u201clet Brad speak to the press. Better yet, the two of you can speak as a team.\u201d</p><p>Laymon frowned, looking mildly annoyed.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Leslie repeated firmly.</p><p>Laymon sighed deeply, looking at her with sorrow in his gray eyes. \u201cYou never used to be so shy,\u201d he said. \u201cOkay, sorry, I understand. It\u2019s just that...\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI understand. Whatever you want. All right, I\u2019ll get the ball rolling for the press conference, and you stay here\u2014grab some students to give you a hand\u2014and make sure that the site is protected until we get back to it in the morning. I\u2019m going to see to it that we get some police out here to keep an eye on things, too.\u201d</p><p>Leslie wasn\u2019t sure why anyone would want to disturb a paupers\u2019 cemetery, but she knew that plenty of digs had been compromised, even ruined, by intruders in the past. She assured Laymon that she would stand guard until they were battened down for the night.</p><p>He stared at her, letting out a sigh and shaking his head again as he walked away. Brad walked behind him. One of the grad students, a shapely redhead, hurried up alongside Brad, slipping an arm through his. Leslie decided that she would have to tease him about her later.</p><p>For a moment, she wondered what Brad said about her when he decided to get close to a woman. Oh, my friend Leslie? Completely platonic. She was engaged, but there was a terrible accident. She almost died, and her fianc\u00e9 was killed. Since then she\u2019s been having kind of a hard time, so I try to be there for her. But it wasn\u2019t that long ago, just a year....</p><p>Just a year.</p><p>She wondered if she would ever again feel that there was a perfect guy out there for. Right now, all she felt was... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cold.</p><p>Just a year. A year since she had buried Matt. Buried her life...</p><p>With a shake, she forced her attention back to her work.</p> <p>Despite her determination to call it an early night, she found herself dragged to a celebration dinner. They didn\u2019t opt for anything fancy\u2014budget would always be important in field work\u2014just a chain pancake house on the main highway. But when the group decided to go on to a local tavern for a few drinks, she at last managed to bow out.</p><p>She returned to the residence provided for those higher up in the echelon. She, Laymon, Brad and a few others were housed in a Colonial plantation that was now a charming bed-and-breakfast. Their hostess, a cheerful septuagenarian, rose with the rooster\u2019s crow, so she went to bed early. She happily saw them off each morning, and since she was a bit hard of hearing, she was also happy when they came in late at night, because she never heard a thing.</p><p>Very tired herself, but feeling a comforting sense of satisfaction, Leslie helped herself to a cup of hot tea from the well-stocked kitchen left open for the help-yourself pleasure of the guests. She took a seat before the large open hearth that dominated the room and sipped her tea from the comfort of the rocker to the left of the gently burning fire. Within a few minutes, she knew she was not alone.</p><p>She glanced slowly to her side, a smile curving her lips as she looked at the man who had joined her. He had a rounded stomach, emphasized by his plain black waistcoat and the bit of bleached cotton that protruded from his waistband right where it shouldn\u2019t. His wig was a bit messy, but in the style of his time, and the tricornered hat he wore sat perfectly atop it. His hose were thick, white and somewhat worn; his shoes bore handsome buckles. His cheeks were rosy, his eyes a bit dark and small beneath bushy brows. He looked at her and returned her smile with a sigh of satisfaction. \u201cWell, now, it\u2019s good and done, eh?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cAnd you mustn\u2019t worry, Reverend Donegal. It\u2019s true that some of the bones will be boxed and sent for analysis, but the people at the Smithsonian are very careful and reverent. They\u2019ll be returned, and we\u2019ll see to it that all the dead are reinterred with prayers and all the respect that\u2019s due them. And I believe that once the significance of what we\u2019ve found here has been verified, the Park Service will have its way. A lovely memorial and a facsimile of the church will be built, and generations of visitors will be able to enjoy the beautiful countryside and learn about everything that happened here during both the Revolutionary and Civil Wars.\u201d Her smile turned slightly rueful. \u201cI know you did a great deal to help refugees during the Revolutionary War, but this very house was a stop for escaping slaves during the days of the Underground Railroad. There was also a Civil War skirmish in the front yard here. It\u2019s amazing the place is still standing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSolid construction,\u201d Reverend Donegal said sternly. \u201cFolks to care for her. Why, I remember, years and years ago, of course, when I came many a Sunday to this house for my tea following services...ah, lovely then, it was. So much excitement and fear. A new country.\u201d His eyes darkened, and he seemed troubled for a minute. \u201cPity...one war always leads to the next. It hurt me to be here...to see so many fine men die, North and South, believing in the same God.... Ah, well, never mind. There\u2019s always hope that man will learn from his mistakes.\u201d He paused, his old eyes clouding, and she knew he was looking back to his own time, firmly fixed in his mind.</p><p>Of course, she knew his story. He had worshipped the hostess of his very house from afar, always entirely circumspect, but enjoying every opportunity to be in her company. He had faithfully served his flock of parishioners; a good man. His one pleasure had been his Sunday tea. And so, one day, he had come here, had his tea...and then died of a heart attack in the arms of the woman he had secretly adored for so many years. Leslie had thought at first that he must have been a very sad ghost, seeking the love he hadn\u2019t allowed himself in life. But that hadn\u2019t been the case at all. She had discovered that he had been at peace with himself; that his distant and unrequited love for Mrs. Adella Baxter had in actuality been a pleasant fantasy but not one he had truly hoped to fulfill. He had enjoyed his life as a bachelor, administering to his flock. He had stayed all these years because he felt so many of his flock needed to be remembered. In short, he had wanted the graveyard found.</p><p>At first, he hadn\u2019t trusted her. He\u2019d tried a dozen tricks, moving her brush around, locking her suitcase, hiding her keys. He hadn\u2019t expected her to see him, and he certainly hadn\u2019t expected her to get angry, yell at him and demand that they talk. Once they had, he\u2019d become an absolute charmer. Through his eyes, she\u2019d seen the house as it had been in his day. She\u2019d experienced his passion as he\u2019d spoken of what he and so many others had gone through to establish a new country; his fear that he might be hanged as a traitor\u2014something that had been a distinct possibility many times during the brutal years of the Revolution. He was deeply disturbed that so few of the people who passed through the old house were aware of just how precarious the struggle for freedom had been. \u201cYou can\u2019t understand,\u201d he had told her. \u201cWe almost lost the war. In fact, it\u2019s a miracle that we won. And all those men who signed the Declaration of Independence? They would have been hanged! So many risked so much. Ah, well, God does show his will, against all odds.\u201d</p><p>Right now he seemed lost in thought.</p><p>\u201cThank you for your help,\u201d she said very softly to him.</p><p>He nodded, then wagged a finger at her. \u201cI expect you to play fair, young lady. You see that the right thing is done by my people. Especially little Peg. You did find her grave, didn\u2019t you, right where I sent you?\u201d</p> <p>Leslie nodded, then stared at the fire for a moment, as lost in the past as he had been. It was strange. Before the blast, she\u2019d had intuitions, like the one that had helped her find the homeless man. As if she could close her eyes and imagine something of a life now gone, then home in on it. Logic? Instinct? Something more? She couldn\u2019t have said. But now...</p><p>Now ghosts came into her life.</p><p>\u201cI will see that Peg\u2019s story is told,\u201d she assured Reverend Donegal. She repeated what he had told her before about the girl. \u201cPeg, aged ten, walked the ten miles from town through a pouring, freezing rain to bring the men from the county together when she knew an attack was coming. She rallied the local troops, and they successfully defended the river and the plantation here, all because of her bravery. She died of the fever that came on her that night, after her journey through the rain and cold and enemy lines. And after the war...well, people were poor. She was given the best burial they could manage.\u201d</p><p>He nodded in satisfaction. \u201cA statue would be very nice. You will get someone to pay for a statue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pay for a statue of her myself, if need be,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>He looked at her indignantly. \u201cA statue of me!\u201d he declared. \u201cOh, well, of course, Peg must be honored, too, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have a place when they rebuild the church, and Peg will be honored in the graveyard. How\u2019s that?\u201d she said, glad she could smile.</p><p>He nodded, staring at the fire. \u201cThere\u2019s a chill in here,\u201d he said. \u201cAh, these old bones...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is chilly tonight, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re really feeling your old bones,\u201d she teased. She set her cup down and rose, walked to the fire and let it warm her hands. When she turned to speak to the reverend again, he was gone.</p><p>She sat back in her chair. In a little while she heard the others returning. It had grown late; she assumed they would head right up to their beds, but she sensed someone behind her, and this time she heard breathing.</p><p>She turned. Brad was there, just inside the doorway, staring at her.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he echoed, still staring at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cLaymon really didn\u2019t say anything to you yet?\u201d he asked, looking surprised. \u201cI thought he called you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re researching another site in Lower Manhattan,\u201d he said.</p><p>She felt a streak of cold sweep along her spine, as if she\u2019d been stroked by an icy sword. She looked at the fire, trying to speak perfectly calmly. \u201cI\u2019m sure that at any given time, someone is always digging somewhere in Lower Manhattan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is going to be a major project.\u201d He was quiet for a minute. \u201cNear Hastings House.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d she murmured, still staring at the flames.</p><p>He hunkered down by her chair. \u201cYou know, only the one room was severely damaged. They\u2019ve pretty much got the place back up and running now.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers tensed on the arms of her chair. \u201cGlad to hear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened there was a tragic accident, Leslie.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him\u2014hard. \u201cYes, I do know that, Brad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe point is, you don\u2019t seem to get it, to understand what that means. I\u2019m not trying to be brutal here, Leslie, but Matt died. You didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She stared blankly back at him for several moments.</p><p>\u201cI almost died there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. And I\u2019m grateful to be alive. I truly appreciate every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to go back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime to go back?\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cYou need to accept the past, and move into the present and then into the future. No, you\u2019ll never forget Matt. But you have to accept that he\u2019s dead. You\u2019ve been...well, kind of weird since it happened. Maybe you need to confront your memories.\u201d</p><p>Again, she stared at him.</p><p>Oh, Brad. You don\u2019t get it, do you? And I will never, ever explain, I can assure you of that.</p><p>\u201cWe still have work to do here,\u201d she said flatly.</p><p>He waved a hand in the air. \u201cWe\u2019re the pros\u2014there are lots of worker bees. Thanks to you and your amazing instincts, all that\u2019s left is the grunt work. We can move on.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cListen, this new site is really important.... I know Laymon wants to talk to you about it. He\u2019s going back to lead the team, with or without you. With or without us,\u201d Brad amended quickly.</p><p>Her nails dug into the arms of the chair. She stared at the flames. \u201cI\u2019ve made some promises here,\u201d she said.</p> <p>He looked puzzled. \u201cYou made promises? To whom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo myself. To see that people are honored, that bones are buried with the proper rites,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll tell Laymon, and he\u2019ll make sure it happens,\u201d Brad said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019re leaving the country. With the way your reputation has grown, you can drop a word and people will hustle, you know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cLaymon got the call when we were on the way to the tavern, and he talked about nothing else once we got there,\u201d Brad said softly. \u201cNew York City, Leslie! You know you love it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t go back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to go back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrad...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeslie, please.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him and saw the earnest plea in his eyes. She lowered her head quickly, not wanting him to read her thoughts.</p><p>Hastings House. It was fixed, repaired, reopened. Brought back to life again. But the dead...the dead couldn\u2019t be brought back to life...?</p> <p>And some of the dead had never left.</p><p>She lowered her head, biting her lower lip. It had started immediately. In the hospital, she\u2019d thought she\u2019d gone mad. There had been the horrible pain, the ache like the loss of a limb or half of her soul, knowing Matt was gone. The concussion, the bruising, the cuts, scrapes, burns...</p><p>Those had been nothing compared to the pain of losing Matt.</p><p>At first she had lived in a stage somewhere between consciousness and dreams. One night she\u2019d awakened in the hospital morgue, drawn there by a man who had lost his wedding ring when they\u2019d rolled him down. All he had wanted was to have his ring put back on his finger. But she hadn\u2019t known that, and she\u2019d freaked. She was lucky she hadn\u2019t wound up in the psychiatric ward that night. Luckily for her, the next day she\u2019d discovered an article in a news magazine about a man named Adam Harrison and the group of paranormal investigators who worked for him. No matter how the reporter had tried to trip him up, the man had come off as intelligent and well spoken, and not at all like a kook. She had started to shake, reading the article. She had called Harrison Investigations immediately, and, to her amazement, Adam Harrison himself had shown up in the hospital. They had talked then, and again when she had been released. It was as if she had instantly acquired not only a new best friend, one she felt she had known forever, but as if she\u2019d gotten her father back, though her real father had been gone since she was a little girl.</p><p>She\u2019d called Adam right away when she\u2019d started talking to the ghostly Colonial churchman, and soon after, she\u2019d noticed a couple in the crowd of visitors hanging around the site. They\u2019d stood out, and eventually they\u2019d introduced themselves as two of Harrison\u2019s employees. Brent and Nikki Blackhawk\u2014he dark and strikingly handsome, his wife blond and beautiful\u2014had gone back to the house with her and taught her how to become friends with the ghost, even chatted with him casually themselves. There really were others like her, she\u2019d realized, and that meant she was sane.</p><p>\u201cLeslie,\u201d Brad said softly, recalling her to the present. \u201cI told Laymon I\u2019d work the new dig, so I\u2019ll be there with you. You need to go back, to put the past to rest, to put the pain behind you.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. Smiled slowly.</p><p>Brad didn\u2019t know about Adam Harrison, the Black-hawks, or that there were others like them to help her. Brad didn\u2019t know that it was thanks to Adam and his associates that she had been able to sit calmly in a Colonial kitchen, talking to a long-dead reverend, and that she could feel entirely sane as she did so.</p> <p>But as to going back, facing her own ghosts...That was something else again, something she dreaded but something she needed to do.</p><p>Brad let out a soft sigh. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m sorry. Too soon,\u201d he said.</p><p>She stared back at him. \u201cI didn\u2019t say that,\u201d she murmured quickly. \u201cMaybe I should go back. I think...I think maybe I want to go back to Hastings House.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cI know you have an apartment in Brooklyn, but...\u201d He stared, paused, then said quickly, on a single fast breath, \u201cThere are a few rooms available for the workers at Hastings House.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Brad shook his head quickly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t even have mentioned that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is this work for?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cThe Historical Society, of course. Greta will be the official liaison between the society, the contractors and the workers. And once again, it\u2019s Tyson, Smith and Tryon who bought and are developing the property. They\u2019ve been legally blocked from building until the significance of the site is established and any necessary excavation is done. Laymon says they\u2019re taking it well, though, basking in their national publicity as good guys. But the lost time must be costing them a bundle. Anyway, the site is really close to Hastings House. It\u2019s in the next block, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s why they\u2019re offering the rooms at Hastings House?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I even mentioned that, honestly. Hell, I have an apartment in the city, and you have your place in Brooklyn.\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cOf course, you lived there with Matt, so maybe you don\u2019t want to go back there. But I\u2019m glad you\u2019re holding on to it. Real estate in your neighborhood is rising sky-high. Oh, God, I\u2019m sorry. That didn\u2019t come out right. I\u2019m stumbling all over here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Brad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Right.\u201d He tried to smile.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even get to go to his funeral. I was in the hospital,\u201d she murmured, staring at the flames.</p><p>Suddenly a massive ache seemed to tear through her heart.</p><p>Ghosts came to her, sought her out sometimes, asked for her help.</p><p>But not Matt.</p><p>The ghost she wanted to see, desperately longed to tell\u2014one last time\u2014how much she had loved him, how he had been her life, how he had filled the world with wonder with his simple presence...that ghost she never saw.</p><p>\u201cI want to stay at Hastings House,\u201d she said.</p><p>He lowered his head. He was smiling, she realized. He was convinced that he had handled things just right, and that by talking about lodging, he had tricked her into deciding to go back.</p><p>Maybe he deserved his self-congratulations.</p><p>Or maybe it was just time for her to go back.</p><p>\u201cYou really want to stay there? You\u2019re serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDead serious.\u201d</p><p>She stood, patting him on the shoulder as she started out. She paused in the hallway, looking back at him. \u201cNo pun intended,\u201d she said lightly, and offered him a dry grin. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m ready to go back. Excited to go back. Good night.\u201d</p><p>She left him, still down on his knees by the chair.</p><p>Excited? Dear God, she was a liar.</p><p>And yet...</p><p>It was true. She never would have thought of it herself. Never would have woken up one morning thinking, Wow, I\u2019d really love to head back to Hastings House.</p><p>But now that she was going...</p><p>The past beckoned to her. She needed to come to terms with it.</p><p>She had to go back.</p><p>2</p><p>I t was late. A strange time, Joe Connolly thought, to be having this meeting. The woman sitting nervously across from him was stunning, but she reminded him of a high-strung, inbred greyhound. She was excessively thin, and her long fingers were elegantly manicured and glittering with diamonds and other fine jewels. She had called that morning and set up this meeting. They were at the venue of her choice\u2014a small Irish tavern off Wall Street. He would have expected her to suggest a private corner at an exclusive club, but perhaps she didn\u2019t want to be seen with a private investigator. For whatever reason, she had chosen O\u2019Malley\u2019s, which was warm, small and inviting, a pub she had probably visited many a time in her youth.</p><p>She had originally come from humble stock, he knew. On her mother\u2019s side, she was second-generation Irish; her father, an O\u2019Brien, came from a line of hard-working laborers who had arrived in the United States during the 1840s. Blood, sweat and muscle had taken him far in the trades, and thus their modest family fortune had begun and then risen to riches. Then Eileen O\u2019Brien had married well, and she was now Mrs. Thomas Brideswell, widow of the late senator and construction magnate.</p><p>She thrust an eight-by-ten picture of a young woman across the table at him. He stared down at the likeness. Genevieve O\u2019Brien looked back at him. Her eyes were huge and blue, and she was as slender as her aunt Eileen, with beautifully defined features. Her hair was dark, with an auburn sheen. The photographer had captured laughter, eagerness and the optimism of youth.</p><p>\u201cHow old is this picture?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cIt was taken about two and half years ago,\u201d Eileen said, and hesitated. With a weary sadness and a hunch of her shoulders, she looked down. \u201cJust before her falling out with my brother and me.\u201d</p><p>Joe shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t mean to press the issue, but I need to understand. If she left home voluntarily, and there was already an estrangement between you, what makes you so sure that something\u2019s happened to her?\u201d</p><p>Eileen sighed deeply. \u201cDonald died soon after she walked out of his house. She came back for his funeral. She wanted to keep her distance from me and what she called my ridiculous family devotion to a ridiculously dysfunctional family. I think she was upset that my brother died without the two of them ever having made their peace, but...\u201d She lifted one of her bejeweled hands. \u201cI suppose it was nasty growing up in my brother\u2019s household. There was a lot to be said for everything my father and grandfather accomplished, but it came at a price. Impossible expectations for their children. So much fault-finding when something was wrong.\u201d She shook her head, and Joe felt moved by her obvious distress. There was such a deep and underlying sadness in the woman, despite her reserve and elegance. She looked him in the face then. \u201cEver since my brother died, she\u2019s called me every two weeks. At least once, every two weeks. I haven\u2019t heard from her in over a month.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He leaned back, watching her. He had learned a lot in his years with the police force, and a lot more in the years since he had gone out on his own. Watching someone\u2019s face as they spoke was often as important as listening to the words that were said.</p><p>\u201cWas there something said between you the last time you spoke that might have caused a greater rift?\u201d he asked.</p><p>There was a very slight hesitation.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said.</p><p>She was lying.</p><p>\u201cI need to know everything,\u201d he said firmly.</p><p>Again an elegant hand fluttered. \u201cWell, there had been this awful article in one of those tabloids about the family,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d he prompted.</p> <p>\u201cShe was convinced that her father wasn\u2019t her father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe bears a remarkable resemblance to you. I\u2019m assuming you and your brother must have looked quite a bit alike,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Eileen said.</p><p>He waited. \u201cWhat was the paper? When was the article printed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to read that dreadful piece of garbage,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cI need to read it. Mrs. Brideswell, I\u2019m working in the dark here. Your niece is twenty-six. She\u2019s an adult. Adults who choose to disappear are allowed to do so. I have almost nothing to go on. You\u2019ve given me first names and street names for a few acquaintances, and I have her work contacts\u2014though she resigned from her job a month ago. That in itself could indicate that she planned to leave the city. I have addresses for a few of the places where you believe she hung out. You can\u2019t hold back on me. And when I find her\u2014if I find her\u2014I can\u2019t guarantee I can convince her to call you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo! You don\u2019t understand. I believe with my whole heart that if she could call me, she would.\u201d</p><p>Joe answered carefully. \u201cDo you believe that your niece is dead, Mrs. Brideswell?\u201d</p><p>Pain flashed across her features. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI just...I know that she loved...loves me. No matter what came between us...Genevieve would call me. And if she\u2019s out there somewhere...crying for help, she\u2019s crying to me. Oh, my God, Mr. Connolly, I\u2019ll admit there were awful times in the family, times when she was sent away...we were so embarrassed by her activities! My brother was...very strict. With reason, I suppose. My father taught us that we had to behave with propriety, or at least the appearance of it. But still...she loves me. And I know she needs me. I\u2019ve had to admit to myself that she may be dead, but don\u2019t you understand? I have to know. And if she has become a victim of...of some misfortune, I have to see justice done for her before I die.\u201d</p><p>Joe wondered why she spoke so passionately about her own death; she couldn\u2019t be more than forty-something, and she could easily be mistaken for thirty-five.</p><p>\u201cA victim of misfortune,\u201d Joe repeated, and asked flatly, \u201cDo you suspect that she was murdered?\u201d</p><p>Eileen inhaled deeply, and when she spoke, her words were bitter. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to the police, Mr. Connolly, which of course you would imagine I had done. And I don\u2019t know if he warned you or not, but it was your old friend Sergeant Adair who suggested I call you, but not until after he gave me a speech about all the other disappearances that are perplexing him. I gather the police are trying to keep what\u2019s been going on with those prostitutes under wraps, though of course it\u2019s not working. People talk. And those disappearances have been going on for more than a year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut your niece wasn\u2019t a prostitute plying her trade downtown,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>She waved a hand in the air. \u201cI know. And we all know that plenty of people not involved in...in the trade disappear, as well. But I got the impression that Sergeant Adair sees some relationship between those disappearances and the fact that I haven\u2019t heard from Genevieve.\u201d</p> <p>Joe was confused. He knew that Robert Adair was tearing his hair out over the continued disappearances of prostitutes in the downtown area. There were no clues, no trails of blood. The girls just disappeared, but the police knew they hadn\u2019t just moved on\u2014unless they\u2019d moved on without saying a word and leaving all their belongings behind. But what would the daughter of a millionaire have in common with a bunch of missing prostitutes?</p><p>\u201cI think this remains a very sensitive area for the police. The women who\u2019ve disappeared are adults. Adults have a right to move on in their lives.\u201d</p><p>Eileen stared at him, her eyes scorning his words. \u201cWe both know the truth.\u201d</p><p>She was right. It had begun over a year ago. A few months apart, two prostitutes had vanished, but since there had been no clues and no signs of foul play, little had been done when their friends reported them missing. Then a homeless transvestite known as the Mimic had disappeared. Then two more young women.</p><p>She leaned closer to him, her eyes still flashing. She might be rich, but she could be tough when she needed to. \u201cThe thing is, prostitutes murdered by their johns usually turn up somewhere. A homeless man who freezes to death is found on the pavement. But these girls disappeared off the streets without a trace\u2014just like Genevieve. Do you think aliens are beaming these people up, Mr. Connolly? I don\u2019t. I think there is a serial killer at large in New York who knows how to dispose of bodies so they\u2019ll never be found. I thought it was disgraceful when I first heard about the disappearances and the apparent lack of concern on the part of our government on the local and even the state level. Now? I\u2019m incensed. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019m not angry with the poor cop just trying to work his beat. I\u2019m furious that someone doesn\u2019t step in and say, \u2018These people count!\u2019 And now I haven\u2019t heard a word from Gen in so long, and every day I\u2019m more and more worried, and though it doesn\u2019t seem that I have any power, I do have money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, let\u2019s look at this from the beginning. Your niece was a social worker, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, here in the city,\u201d Eileen murmured. \u201cUp until a little more than a month ago. She found it terribly frustrating....\u201d She inhaled deeply. \u201cAnd not just the job itself. In my family, we were supposed to make\u2014or marry\u2014money. Both my brother and I were terribly hard on Gen, and all she wanted to do was make life easier on those who didn\u2019t have the same advantages we did. The frustration and red tape got to her, as well, but...none of that\u2019s what matters now. This is the point, this is why I think there\u2019s a connection. She\u2019d been working to help prostitutes in the same area where prostitutes have been disappearing into thin air. Don\u2019t you see? I\u2019m sure she knew some of those missing girls!\u201d Eileen herself seemed ready to explode at that moment.</p><p>\u201cDo you know any particulars on why she quit her job?\u201d</p><p>Eileen waved a slender, elegant hand in the air. \u201cIrritation with the system. She wanted to get workfare programs going...she wanted to help some of the girls keep their children. She is really an extraordinary human being, Mr. Connolly. Oh, I am so frustrated. No one seems to believe that I know that something\u2019s really wrong. The police can\u2019t\u2014or won\u2019t\u2014do anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do understand your frustration,\u201d Joe told her, \u201cbut you have to understand that the police are seriously frustrated themselves. The point is, these are disappearances. There\u2019s nothing for them to go on. And the people who have disappeared\u2014in this particular situation\u2014have lived transient lifestyles, which makes it very hard, as well. They can question those closest to the victims\u2014if that\u2019s what they are. They can question people up and down the streets where the victims were last seen. They\u2019ve harassed known pimps to the point that their behavior borders on the illegal. But absolutely no one so far has seen anything to indicate foul play. Meanwhile, the police still have murders, rapes and robberies to deal with, crimes with sadly obvious victims. There\u2019s only so much they can do when they have no victims, no murder weapons, no blood trails, no evidence of any kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlood trails?\u201d Eileen said, her eyes snapping. \u201cThey have to find out what\u2019s going on and stop it before we discover that we\u2019re in a river of blood! And before my niece is discovered lying dead somewhere. But they\u2019re not going to find out what\u2019s going on because, as you say, they have to deal with the blood they do see on the streets. I\u2019m not calling our police incompetent. They try. Sergeant Adair has, I believe, been ordered to find the explanation for these disappearances, no matter what. They\u2019ve searched Gen\u2019s apartment\u2014if she disappeared by choice, she did so with only her purse and the clothes on her back, not even a good coat. They\u2019ve been to her former office. They\u2019ve tried to question people on the streets. Sadly, I know nothing about her real friends. Or if she was dating. The basics have been done. They\u2019ve proved nothing. Except that she\u2019s gone, which I already knew. So I\u2019ve hired you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you will find Genevieve,\u201d she said passionately. \u201cBecause you will make finding her your priority every single morning from the moment you open your eyes. I\u2019ll reward you highly.\u201d</p><p>He pocketed the picture. \u201cYou know my fee. I don\u2019t work to be rewarded highly. If I take a case on, it\u2019s part of my every waking moment until I have an answer. But I\u2019ll need your help at all times. Be ready to answer my calls,\u201d he warned her. \u201cI need to assimilate all that I\u2019ve learned from you tonight, then get busy on my own and see what else I can discover. But I\u2019ll need more help from you. I\u2019ll need everything. Everything you know, anything that occurs to you. And don\u2019t hold back on me. I\u2019m in your employ. I\u2019ll never repeat anything you tell me. Don\u2019t let any family embarrassment hold you back from being entirely truthful with me, do you understand, Mrs. Brideswell? I can\u2019t help you if you aren\u2019t completely honest with me. No amount of money will change that.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Reaching down, she found her purse and produced a small notepad. \u201cI\u2019ve written down everything I know, what names and places I\u2019ve heard...anything I can think of that might be some help.\u201d She produced a pen, scribbling down another notation. \u201cI\u2019ve added the publication I was talking about,\u201d she murmured. \u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He accepted the notepad from her. \u201cI\u2019ll do everything I can,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She picked up the teacup before her on the table, her eyes distant. She drank what must have been very cold tea by then.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very sorry about your cousin,\u201d she said softly.</p> <p>\u201cThank you.\u201d The words took him by surprise, though he knew instantly what she meant.</p><p>\u201cHis death was a tremendous loss to the city, but for you, of course, it was very personal, and I extend my sincere condolences.\u201d Her eyes began to water. \u201cI was there that night, you know,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI learned later that Gen would have been interested in going. In retrospect, I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t know in time to invite her. She\u2019d met a lot of people involved through the years. She had a lot of close contact with the police\u2014being a social worker and all. And she knew Greta through me, of course.\u201d</p><p>Joe couldn\u2019t help himself. He leaned forward. \u201cWhat do you remember about that night?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe lights, the music, the beautiful clothing, the glamour...I was in the entryway when the explosion occurred. They rounded us up and got us out immediately. I remember standing on the street and just being incredulous. I remember the sound of the sirens, the ambulances, the paramedics...and the body bags,\u201d she said. \u201cI am so, so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. Eileen, do you remember anything strange at all?\u201d he pressed.</p><p>She gave him a pained smile. \u201cYou lost someone you loved, so you want there to be a reason, a better explanation than a gas explosion. No, I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s all a blur. I was chatting, there was a noise like thunder. Someone was screaming \u2018fire,\u2019 people were panicking...the cops came and we were all ushered out.\u201d</p><p>Joe nodded. Just what had he been hoping for?</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>Her eyes met his, and her words were desperate. \u201cI have to find Genevieve, Mr. Connolly. Please help me.\u201d</p> <p>Although her posture still seemed so regal and aloof, he reached across the table and laid his hand on hers. \u201cI will do everything I can,\u201d he told her solemnly.</p><p>She almost smiled. And then she turned her palm up and gripped his hand in return. Her touch was strong, and as desperate as the sound of her voice.</p><p>They talked for a few minutes longer about Genevieve, and as the girl in the picture began to come to life for him, Joe began to make mental notes as to exactly where he would begin his investigation. First he would go over the basic police work. Then he would move on to where the police, by virtue of their sworn duty, could not go.</p><p>There were others in the house.</p><p>He knew that from the beginning.</p><p>At first it was only a vague sense of awareness. They paid him no mind, seemed not to see or recognize him, but even so, he was aware that he was not alone.</p><p>There was the woman in the kitchen, for one. She was always by the hearth, stirring something in what he imagined had been a pot over an open fire. She was pretty and young, and wore Colonial garb, including a little mobcap on her head. He wasn\u2019t sure if she had been an illicit mistress or a servant, but she hummed in a pretty voice as she stirred. Every so often she would suddenly straighten, her face pinching into a mask of pain. She would turn around, and her eyes would widen, and then she would fall...and fade away.</p><p>There was the soldier in the entry. He staggered into the house, mingled with the misty form of another individual. He would whisper something about a betrayal, and then he, too, would fall and fade away.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t want to be one of them. He didn\u2019t want to spend eternity standing by the hearth in the servants\u2019 pantry, laughing pleasantly, looking across the room...and then disappearing in the memory of an explosion.</p><p>After a while he realized that in addition to playing out their final moments over and over again, they did more. They recognized one another, though they might not have come from the same time. They mingled now and then.</p><p>While he...</p><p>He didn\u2019t need to worry about eternally haunting the servants\u2019 pantry. He couldn\u2019t even manage that much. He could only be...aware.</p><p>So why was he there? Just to ache? Just to yearn and fear constantly for the woman he had loved? Damn it. Not fair. He\u2019d lived his life as a decent man.</p><p>Others had died with him, so where were they? He didn\u2019t have any sense of them whatsoever.</p><p>He saw the workmen. Heard them talk. Perhaps it should have been gratifying to have even that much contact with what had once been his world. To hear their anger that he should have died in such a stupid freak accident. They had respected and admired him. Nice to know, except that he was still dead.</p><p>Then came the day when the woman at the hearth turned to look at him at last. She even gave him a little smile. Maybe he was somehow real then. She walked over, and it felt as if she touched his cheek, like a sweet sister. \u201cIt takes time,\u201d she told him, and smiled again.</p><p>All he could whisper was \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged sadly. \u201cJustice? Something that must be known? The man who murdered me walked free. Perhaps it\u2019s too late and the world will never know. So much time has passed. But it\u2019s not so horrible, really. Maybe we\u2019re here because we\u2019ve more to learn?\u201d</p><p>There was a comfort in her contact. Soon after, the soldier acknowledged him, too.</p><p>Then the burning question began in his mind. Why? There had to be a reason why he was here and the others who\u2019d died that night weren\u2019t.</p><p>The question dominated his thoughts, filled him with the resolve to know the answer, to solve the mystery of what had happened.</p><p>Sometimes, though, he thought of Leslie. Good God, how he had loved her....</p><p>It was late when the phone ring, but Leslie wasn\u2019t asleep. And, oddly enough, she knew immediately who it was.</p><p>\u201cHi, Nikki.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing to do with intuition or special gifts,\u201d Leslie said with a laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s late, but we\u2019ve been on the news, and I knew that you\u2019re the one person who might be calling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. I got to help find closure for people, in a weird sort of way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Nikki said.</p><p>Leslie could picture Nikki. Slim and vivacious, with brilliant blue-green eyes. She led tours in New Orleans and loved history. She loved her city, too, and was working hard to bring tourism back to New Orleans. But she and Brent had taken time out to help Leslie adjust to life with the dead popping up now and then. What had seemed like a curse had almost become a gift with Nikki and Brent so serenely at her side.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s everything going in your neck of the woods?\u201d Leslie asked.</p><p>\u201cStep by step, but we\u2019re coming back. So many neighborhoods are still in need of total rebuilding, but we\u2019ll get there. And you? Everything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. I think...I think we may have seen the last of the reverend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Well, bless his heart. So...I guess you\u2019re going to see to the details now? My history is a lot easier\u2014I just talk about it. You spend hours brushing dust off yours.\u201d</p><p>Leslie wondered why she\u2019d thought that Nikki already knew what she was about to do.</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d she replied, \u201cI\u2019m going home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew York. I was born in the South, but New York\u2019s been home for a long time now. There\u2019s a new project there, a site near...near Hastings House, and I\u2019m going to work on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d Nikki asked flatly.</p><p>\u201cYes...No...Maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll never actually be ready. I think I just have to do it.\u201d</p><p>The phone line was silent for several seconds, and she knew that Nikki was carefully weighing her next words. \u201cLeslie, you do know that although we\u2019ve come to accept certain things and learned to use our abilities to a degree, we don\u2019t have all the answers. You\u2019re still fragile, whether you want to believe that or not. So be careful. And don\u2019t...don\u2019t let yourself get trapped in the past, in what was. You\u2019re here. You\u2019re alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNikki, thanks to you guys, I\u2019m still sane and I appreciate living. It\u2019s just that...you know how you feel when you lose someone, like there were so many things you didn\u2019t get to say, and you want so desperately to know that everything is all right, and of course it isn\u2019t, because the person is dead...okay, now I do sound a little on the loopy side. But...I just wish I could say goodbye, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t know that you\u2019ll get that chance, Leslie, even if you do go back. Matt Connolly was an exceptional man. He did a lot of good in his days on earth. He might, well...he might never be seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that. I promise you, I\u2019m not going home because I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll see him if I do. I just know I have to go on. And this is a great opportunity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant me to hop a plane on up?\u201d</p><p>Leslie smiled. Some things were so strange. She\u2019d had many friends when Matt had died. Nice people. But she\u2019d found that she had to push them away a bit. Politely, she hoped. It was just that she didn\u2019t really want to make their lives painful, and she didn\u2019t like people tiptoeing around her feelings. She hadn\u2019t been able to talk, really talk, to many people. But then Nikki had stepped into her life, and it had been as if she\u2019d known her forever.</p><p>Of course, they both saw ghosts, as did Nikki\u2019s husband, Brent. Nikki always found it amusing that most people accepted his ability to communicate with the dead more easily than hers, simply because he had Dakota Sioux in his background. Apparently that made him a more spiritual soul in the eyes of the world.</p><p>\u201cLeslie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay. And I...I think I need to be alone a bit. But later, I\u2019d love for you to visit. I\u2019ll show you New York as you\u2019ve never seen it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal,\u201d Nikki said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After a few more minutes of chat, they hung up.</p><p>Leslie lay in bed, awake. She was going home for all the right reasons, she assured herself. The work. The opportunity. And she just plain loved New York. She needed to be back.</p><p>Hell.</p> <p>She was going home to try to find a way to reach Matt....</p><p>Joe watched as Eileen settled into her chauffeur-driven sedan, refusing the offer of a ride with a thank-you, though he wasn\u2019t really sure why. It was late, but this was New York. People were out at all hours, even though some areas, like this one, became much quieter.</p><p>When the car had disappeared into the easy flow of the late-night traffic, he found himself just walking down the street. He had always loved downtown. He was a New Yorker, born and bred in Brooklyn Heights, an area he loved. But downtown New York offered a history few people took the time to appreciate, since the city offered such a bustle of business, shopping and entertainment.</p><p>His walk took him down Broadway. He found himself feeling a strange sense of comfort as he walked by St. Paul\u2019s; even the old burial ground, a sign of the times gone by, gave him a sense of permanence and belonging. He loved St. Paul\u2019s, though it wasn\u2019t as grand as Trinity Church just down the road. St. Paul\u2019s was the only remaining church built before the Revolutionary War, a true Georgian masterpiece. Washington\u2019s pew was still there, along with displays honoring those who had worked tirelessly on the rescue efforts after 9/11, since the church lay in the shadows of the monumental tragedy. Drenched in history, yet still a place for modern man to find solace.</p><p>He kept walking, wondering at the age of some of the buildings, trying to discern what might really be old beneath a newer facade, his wanderings taking him by Fraunces Tavern and then down to the once-again newly restored Hastings House.</p> <p>He had come here before, since that fateful night. Several times. And he never knew exactly why. Every time he felt the same searing and poignant ripple of pain. Four dead. Jerry Osbourne, police officer. Sally Rydell, socialite. Tom Burton, architect. And Matthew Connolly, brilliant journalist, a man whose words had the ability to create genuine change.</p><p>He\u2019d been working out in Las Vegas when it had happened, on a cold case involving kidnapping, fraud and money laundering. The job had taken nearly a year, but it had paid extremely well. He\u2019d managed to tie it all up shortly after he\u2019d flown home for his cousin\u2019s funeral.</p><p>He had never felt so numb in his life. When he\u2019d gone to the hospital afterward, where Matt\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, Leslie, had still been in intensive care, he had been grateful to discover that she spent most of her time unconscious. He hadn\u2019t known what to say to her. Because of the amount of time he spent out of the city, he\u2019d never actually met her, except maybe once, when they\u2019d been kids. He\u2019d felt awkward, glad that he could leave a message saying he\u2019d been there, equally glad to disappear.</p><p>Strange, growing up, he and Matt had seen each other only on family occasions. Matt had lived by Central Park; he had lived in Brooklyn Heights. Once it had seemed as if they were far apart. Maybe it was just the size of New York. Each neighborhood was complete unto itself. They\u2019d always gotten along; as adults, even though real distance often came between them. They had actually become the best of friends. Maybe it had been their shared passion for many of the same rights and ideals.</p><p>Matt had been a man of impeccable integrity. Many people would miss him. But for Joe, the loss was personal, and he still felt a helpless rage every time he thought about the stupidity of the way he\u2019d died.</p><p>He had planned to return to the city after wrapping up of the Vegas thing and get to know Leslie and make plans with Matt. He would have been the best man at the wedding. Strange. He didn\u2019t know Leslie because of happenstance. They had simply never been in the same place at the same time, yet she was the closest living link to Matt.</p> <p>It was amazing that she had survived the blast.</p><p>The force of the explosion had thrown her across the room, saving her from the flames. Then again, the dead had died on impact, according to the coroner; they hadn\u2019t had to face the agony of burning to death.</p><p>The blast had been investigated. Backward and forward and inside out. But in the end, there had been no explanation other than that there had been a gas buildup in the line. The innocent flicking of a furnace switch had caused a spark, which had triggered the explosion and the tragedy.</p><p>Hastings House was back now. It was open to the public, other than the private rooms in back, some of which were maintained as offices and others as accommodations for archaeologists working on historical sites around downtown. It seemed that these days, every construction project uncovered some remnant of the past, a clear illustration of the contrast between those dedicated to preservation and those dedicated to moving on. Hastings House had been a worthy project, he was sure. But he could never forget what had happened there, and he found himself turning quickly away for a moment to compose himself before looking back at the building. He couldn\u2019t help the bitterness that seemed to assail him every time he saw the house. He understood Eileen Brideswell, because it seemed to him, too, that pain was only endurable with knowledge or a conclusion; he realized that the rage that filled him each time he came here had more to do with his feelings of helplessness and failure than the natural pain of loss. He couldn\u2019t help but believe, no matter what conclusion the extensive investigations had led to, that something more had gone on here. That they had missed something.</p><p>That someone had gotten away with murder.</p><p>Had Matt been the target?</p><p>He\u2019d done some investigating himself, hitting dead end after dead end. He was sure it was frustration that kept him coming back to stand here, impotently staring at the house.</p><p>People walked past him. Tourists, with their guidebooks out. He wondered if he should warn them that wandering around on their own wasn\u2019t such a great thing to be doing at that hour of the night.</p> <p>A few teenagers walked by the house, and then a couple with two children somewhere around the age of ten. More tourists.</p><p>\u201cIs it haunted?\u201d the boy asked eagerly.</p><p>\u201cCould be,\u201d the father said. \u201cPatriots met here during the Revolutionary War, and others met here during the War of 1812. It was even a stop on the Underground Railroad during the Civil War. Lots of people could be haunting the place.\u201d The father winked.</p><p>His wife nudged him. \u201cDon\u2019t go telling him that, Herbert,\u201d she said firmly, then dropped her voice to a whisper. \u201cPeople died here just last year.\u201d</p><p>The father sighed. \u201cMarina, we\u2019re seeing New York. Can\u2019t we just let the kids have some fun along with their education?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFun?\u201d the wife repeated icily.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d the father said with a sigh.</p><p>Joe couldn\u2019t help himself. \u201cGood evening,\u201d he said, approaching the group. \u201cIt\u2019s a little late. Not much open around here at this hour. Actually...nothing open. But bars.\u201d</p><p>The father puffed up. But the wife agreed.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she murmured, staring at Joe a little suspiciously, then tugged at her husband\u2019s arm. \u201cWe should get back to the hotel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe only have two days here with the kids,\u201d the husband said.</p><p>\u201cYou might notice that the street is pretty deserted,\u201d Joe said politely.</p><p>\u201cAre you a cop?\u201d the wife asked.</p><p>\u201cI was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI read in the newspaper that there have been unexplained disappearances in this area,\u201d the wife said.</p><p>\u201cAre we prostitutes?\u201d the husband hissed.</p><p>\u201cI want to go,\u201d the wife insisted.</p><p>They moved on, looking back now and then to see that they weren\u2019t being followed.</p><p>\u201cCatch a taxi down the block\u2014they\u2019ll be going north,\u201d Joe called.</p><p>Then he put the house and its memories behind him and started down the street in the opposite direction, shrugging his shoulders, as if he could shrug away the feelings that seized him every time he came to Hastings House.</p><p>Strange. He felt as if the house itself were beckoning to him.</p><p>As if something\u2014someone?\u2014inside was calling him back, unwilling to let him go.</p><p>He gritted his teeth and moved on. He wasn\u2019t given to fantasy. The real world was tough enough.</p><p>Still, he stopped halfway down the block and stared back at the house. Then, almost angrily, he moved on.</p><p>A house simply could not call out to him, as if asking for some kind of help....</p><p>3</p><p>I t was evening when they arrived at Hastings House. To the left there was a large pit, along with the partially demolished miniskyscraper that was being torn down to be replaced by a megabuilding. Downtown was coming back in a big way.</p><p>To the right\u2014beyond a narrow expanse of grass, the only evidence that there had once been many residences in the area\u2014stood an office building/apartment complex built in the 1940s. The sun was falling, and, if Leslie narrowed her vision, she could almost imagine what this very small spot in the world might have looked like in the past.</p><p>But then she began to hear the angry beeping of horns, the sudden blare of rap music, a shout, the click of heels on pavement...this was, after all, New York. Even on a lazy Sunday afternoon, this was the piece of granite where so many people had decided they had to live. The center of the universe, in the minds of so many. She smiled. With all its sins and dirt and mixture of good and evil, she loved the city. Rebel she might be, but she loved New York.</p><p>And it was good to be back.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d the cabbie interjected, breaking her thoughts. With an accent only on the single syllable, she wasn\u2019t sure just what part of the world his speech denoted. \u201cSomebody gonna pay me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, right,\u201d Professor Laymon said. Leslie didn\u2019t even turn around. She felt Brad at her shoulder as she stared at Hastings House. What would it offer up to her now? Now that she was who she was\u2014now that she was changed?</p><p>She felt Brad\u2019s hand on her shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s a house,\u201d he said softly. \u201cBut if you\u2019re the least bit uneasy, there\u2019s no reason on earth for you to stay here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She turned, smiling at him. \u201cI want to stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t bring Matt back to life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said, looking back toward Hastings House.</p> <p>The house was beautiful. Two stories high, and all the outer over-the-centuries additions had been ripped away and its facade had been restored to the Colonial-era style in which it had been originally built. Even downtown, there were few buildings to compare with it, other than St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral and Fraunces Tavern. It had been given a white-picket fence\u2014higher than it would have been when the house was built, and even as the sun set, the alarm wires around it were visible. A sign on the gate advertised the house\u2019s historical importance, and announced visiting times and admission prices.</p><p>It looked just as it had the last time she had come here.</p><p>The damage from the blast and fire had been repaired.</p><p>And since it was Sunday, after five, there were no lingering tourists. The horn blasts and other street sounds seemed to come from far away. The house was quiet, as if it were resting.</p><p>As if it were expecting something.</p> <p>Then the front door burst open, and Greta Peterson came hurrying down the walk to the gate. \u201cCome in, come in. We\u2019ve been waiting for you. Watching.\u201d</p><p>We?</p><p>Who the heck else was here? Leslie had hoped for a quiet night. No one would have understood, so she hadn\u2019t said anything, but she really wanted the house to herself.</p><p>Before she knew it, Greta, with all her warmth and enthusiasm, had reached her, hugged her, rested an arm around her shoulders and called out a greeting to Professor Laymon and Brad. Then Greta dragged her up the walk, saying, \u201cOh, Leslie, I\u2019m so happy to see you. You look wonderful, dear. A bit too thin, but wonderful. I know that thin is in...but don\u2019t go losing your shape, young lady.\u201d</p><p>That from a rail-thin, hyper matron, Leslie thought dryly.</p><p>But Greta\u2019s warmth and enthusiasm were endearing. Then, as they neared the house, Leslie\u2019s heart sank.</p> <p>Greta had apparently planned a welcome party. Thankfully, it appeared to be a small one. Sergeant Robert Adair\u2014okay, she liked Robert and was delighted to see him\u2014peeked out the doorway as they approached. Behind him, Hank Smith, from the development company, stepped into view, and then Ken Dryer, the attractive and articulate police spokesman, made an appearance.</p><p>\u201cLeslie!\u201d Robert called, smiling affectionately.</p><p>\u201cRobert,\u201d she said with a smile, accepting a hug as the other men stood back.</p><p>\u201cHey, Les,\u201d Hank said, offering her a handshake.</p><p>Ken Dryer gave her a very proper hug before moving on to shake Brad\u2019s hand and ask about the weather in D.C. Then he started down the path to welcome the professor and collect Leslie\u2019s rolling suitcase from the sidewalk.</p><p>\u201cGorgeous as ever,\u201d Robert Adair whispered softly. \u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked, taking her hands and looking at her with concern in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>He kissed her cheek quickly. Robert was around fifty, she thought, a twenty-year veteran of the force. He worked out of One Police Plaza and wasn\u2019t assigned to a particular precinct. He was called a liaison officer and became involved with crimes that crossed precinct boundaries to affect multiple areas of the city\u2014like the missing prostitutes\u2014or that started garnering more than a mention in the newspapers.</p> <p>Greta bustled past him to stand face-to-face with Leslie.</p><p>\u201cWe are delighted to see you, my dear. If you\u2019d refused to come, everyone would have understood,\u201d she said. There was real concern in her soft gray eyes, the kind that made Leslie feel the ache inside again, but she needed to get past all that. And really, it had been sweet of Greta to find a special way to welcome her, Brad and Professor Layman on their arrival. Greta had been blessed to be born with not just the proverbial silver spoon in her mouth, but with a whole array of cutlery. Her ancestors had been fur traders on a par with the Astors. She was a born-and-bred New Yorker who truly loved her city and its history, and because of that ardent love, she was acknowledged as a major\u2014if not the major\u2014power in the field of restoration and archaeology.</p><p>\u201cI love this city, and I\u2019m privileged to be invited to work this new find,\u201d Leslie told her cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cWe all are,\u201d Brad said quickly, then flushed. \u201cWell, the professor is history, but Leslie and I are both very pleased to be respected enough to be asked back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re both not just talented,\u201d Ken Dryer said, \u201cyou love the city. You know the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s so kind of you all to be here,\u201d Leslie said, smiling. \u201cI thought the professor and Brad would be helping me settle in quietly, but it looks like we have a dinner party to attend.\u201d She tried to sound enthusiastic.</p><p>\u201cOh, just us and the caterers,\u201d Greta said. \u201cI had to do something.\u201d Then she cut to the chase. \u201cOh, Leslie...do you really want to stay in the house? Sleep in it?\u201d</p><p>Leslie smiled dryly. \u201cI\u2019m dying to stay here,\u201d she assured Greta.</p><p>\u201cBut you won\u2019t stay?\u201d Greta asked Brad, sounding disapproving.</p><p>Brad shrugged, opting to answer lightly. \u201cSadly, Leslie has made it clear that she would prefer not to sleep with me.\u201d</p><p>Greta wasn\u2019t amused. She frowned.</p><p>\u201cSorry, just teasing,\u201d Brad said quickly. \u201cI have an apartment in Manhattan. Leslie\u2019s place is out in Brooklyn, so it\u2019s more convenient for her to stay here,\u201d Brad said.</p><p>\u201cI can walk right over to the dig,\u201d Leslie explained. She smiled, trying to put Greta at ease. \u201cHonestly, Greta, I love this place. I don\u2019t blame what happened on a house. I want to be here.\u201d</p><p>Greta stared at Professor Laymon. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not staying, either?\u201d she demanded tartly.</p><p>Layman looked acutely uncomfortable. \u201cGreta, we\u2019ve talked, and this is Leslie\u2019s choice. I have a home here, too,\u201d he explained. He lifted his hands, the very image of brilliant but helpless.</p><p>Greta shook her head, her soft, short silver hair bobbing around her attractive face. \u201cOh, dear,\u201d she murmured, still unhappy. \u201cThere\u2019s no guard on duty, you know, except for when the house is open to the public. There\u2019s an alarm system, of course. State-of-the-art. But the Historical Society can\u2019t afford full-time security.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA state-of-the-art alarm system is much better than what I have in Brooklyn,\u201d Leslie assured her. As Greta looked back at her, trying to smile, Leslie realized that the woman had set up the whole party just to keep her from being alone for as long as possible. She had to lower her head and smile. Then she lifted her eyes. \u201cThis place is fantastic. I loved it from the beginning. And I understand that the damage has been completely repaired, that you can\u2019t even tell that...that anything happened. So...how is the tourism thing going? Do a lot of people come see the place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe actually had to have crowd control when it first reopened,\u201d Ken Dryer said. He smiled as he spoke. He always smiled. Wheaten-haired and handsome, like the boy next door all grown-up, with an ability to spin any situation, he was perfectly suited to his position, but Leslie always felt, despite how nice he had always been to her, that he was just a bit oily, as well. What his real thoughts were, she seldom knew. She had heard that he had political ambitions, and she was sure that on the political trail, he would charm an audience without ever really saying anything substantive about the issues.</p><p>\u201cCrowd control?\u201d Brad marveled.</p><p>Robert cleared his throat uneasily. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like an...event to draw crowds.\u201d</p><p>Hank Smith groaned, taking Leslie by the arm. \u201cWhat our good sergeant is trying to explain without words is that not only is this house a historical masterpiece, it has a modern-day tragedy to go with it. Unfortunately, tragedy brings people in droves. In the beginning, we had cops every day. The lines were around the block. That\u2019s slacked off some, but even so, eventually this place is going to pay for itself. Look, you\u2019ve chosen to stay here, and I, for one, am not going to tiptoe around. You know that we were all affected by what happened, that we all felt a terrible loss\u2014not as great as yours, but a terrible loss all the same\u2014and if you want to be here, I say good for you. And that\u2019s not sucking up, that\u2019s God\u2019s honest truth. So, hey, can we eat now, Greta?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, of course,\u201d Greta stuttered. \u201cCome along to the dining room. Leslie, I\u2019ve put you in the best bedroom. We\u2019ll get your bag up in a bit. One of these brawny fellows will be willing to serve as a...well, as a brawny fellow and take it up there for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I can handle a suitcase,\u201d Leslie said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, and one of us can be a gentleman and take care of it, too,\u201d Brad told her. \u201cLet\u2019s eat.\u201d He looked at his watch. She had a feeling that Brad had other plans for the evening and that a welcome-back dinner party hadn\u2019t been on his agenda.</p><p>Leslie...</p><p>She was thinner. She looked almost ethereal. He had never known such pain, such longing, as he felt seeing her there that night. He wanted to touch her so badly. He wanted to tell her that it was all right.</p><p>He wanted to tell her that Hank Smith was a dickhead. He laughed at himself. He hadn\u2019t known he disliked the developer so much. On the surface, the guy was a decent sort. Maybe he was too perfect. Tall, dark and slimy. His Armani suits were pressed to a T. Even his shoes were designer. He was a big man in town. Went to the right clubs. Ate at all the right places. Shook hands with the mayor. Hell, the guy even kissed babies\u2019 cheeks. He was a partner in Tyson, Smith, and Tryon, and he was the perfect representative whenever the firm had to deal with permits, public opinion and the laws of the state. But he just wasn\u2019t the kind of man other men liked. His lines were too smooth. He didn\u2019t kick back at a local bar to enjoy a good football game. Did that make him bad? No, just...a dickhead.</p><p>And there was Robert Adair, good old Robert, still looking like a bloodhound. Working tirelessly, always concerned, always in the middle of something tragic, criminal, sad... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ken Dryer. He didn\u2019t like him any better than he liked Hank Smith. He never wore Armani. Instead, he was spotless in his police dress best. But then, Dryer had a tough job, speaking to the media, trying to assure New Yorkers that even under the worst circumstances, they were going to be all right. He supposed he should have more sympathy for the man, but he didn\u2019t. Dryer liked his job too much. Liked finding a way to put a spin on things that always made himself look good.</p><p>Greta...well, she loved history more than life itself. She was a good old broad, caring, genuine, which was hard, when you came from that much money.</p><p>Professor Laymon...he should get to know Greta better. They would make one hell of a couple.</p> <p>Brad Verdun. He almost smiled. Would have smiled, if he\u2019d had substance and could have. Once upon a time, he\u2019d been jealous of Brad. Like Ken Dryer and Hank Smith, Brad loved the limelight. He was a good-looking dude, too. But he\u2019d never had any cause to be jealous. To Leslie, Brad was a friend and colleague, someone with whom she worked well. They\u2019d laughed about a few of his romantic fiascos together. But now...</p><p>His heart ached. Funny, he had no heart, but he could feel the pain. That was then, and this was now. He himself was gone.</p><p>He loved Leslie. Wanted her to have a life. Wanted her to find something as great as what they had shared. Really...</p><p>He just didn\u2019t want her falling for some asshole.</p><p>All right, so he\u2019d gotten bitter. How the hell not?</p> <p>Don\u2019t touch her, don\u2019t you dare touch her, he thought.</p><p>Then he amended that.</p><p>Don\u2019t hurt her, don\u2019t you dare hurt her. If you do, I\u2019ll...</p><p>He\u2019d what? He couldn\u2019t even appear at will, could barely communicate with the others haunting the same space.</p><p>Don\u2019t hurt her, he prayed.</p><p>Hastings House wasn\u2019t huge. The entry was handsome, with the staircase off to the side to allow for a breeze to make its way all the way through the house. Leslie imagined that once those breezes had been plentiful; now, with the house surrounded by skyscrapers, the possibility was highly unlikely. There were two rooms to the right, two rooms to the left, and six bedrooms upstairs. The dining room was the second door on the left, and behind it was the one accommodation to the twenty-first century; the kitchen and huge back pantry were attached to the house by an arched passageway.</p> <p>\u201cAre you really all right?\u201d Robert asked, coming alongside Leslie as they headed toward the dining room.</p><p>She squeezed his arm. \u201cReally,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>Really, she repeated in her mind. I just want you all to get out of my house.</p><p>Her house?</p><p>It wasn\u2019t her house at all.</p><p>It was simply the house where Matt had died.</p><p>\u201cSo, Hank,\u201d Brad said as they filed into the dining room. \u201cYour company made another historical discovery, huh? Must be hard. All that time and money invested\u2014and now you have to stop work and wait for us to prowl around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThankfully,\u201d Professor Laymon said, before Hank could reply, \u201cthe company doesn\u2019t try to hide what it comes across, Brad.\u201d</p> <p>But Hank was grinning. \u201cDo I mind losing money, Brad? Sure. But we get more promotional bucks out of this than you could begin to imagine.\u201d</p><p>As she took a chair at the period reproduction dining table, Leslie ignored the men and flashed a smile at Greta. They were eating on reproduction Dutch porcelain dishes, and fresh flowers graced the table. The minute she\u2019d entered the house, she\u2019d smelled the aroma of beef cooking, so she assumed they would be having a traditional old English pub roast.</p><p>\u201cSo, Hank, tell us more about the find,\u201d Brad said.</p><p>Hank looked a little surprised. \u201cProfessor Laymon has been given all the specifics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s told us what he knows, but I\u2019m curious. Why do you think you\u2019ve discovered a working-class burial?\u201d</p><p>Hank shrugged, taking his seat just as the caterers made their appearance, bringing the meal from the kitchen. A roast, whipped potatoes, greens, a tomato salad. Red wine. A very nice and very traditional meal.</p><p>\u201cNo one has turned vegetarian on me lately, have they?\u201d Greta asked worriedly.</p><p>They all shook their heads as Hank started to answer Brad\u2019s question.</p><p>\u201cWell, we haven\u2019t come across any coffins or bones\u2014we\u2019re leaving that to you,\u201d he said, helping himself to the potatoes. \u201cGravy?\u201d he asked. Ken Dryer passed over the gravy boat.</p><p>\u201cWhat our first worker came across was a set of wooden teeth,\u201d Hank explained.</p><p>\u201cWooden teeth?\u201d Leslie echoed.</p><p>\u201cJust like the pair of George Washington\u2019s in the Smithsonian,\u201d Hank said.</p><p>\u201cPoor people didn\u2019t generally have false teeth,\u201d Leslie said.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re very rough, and only preserved because they happened to have been wrapped in a scrap of tarp, like something a soldier might have had,\u201d Hank said. \u201cI don\u2019t really know anything about this stuff, but that\u2019s what the first guy on the site, someone from the museum, said. Anyway, there was more. A few pieces of jewelry, costume stuff, and poor costume stuff at that. And a couple of tiny crosses\u2014those were actually real silver. We stopped work right away, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Brad agreed. Leslie thought he sounded skeptical, but Brad de facto disliked anyone who worked for a development company.</p><p>\u201cThen,\u201d Greta reminded Hank, \u201cthere were the records we found at the Morgan Library. Records that indicated a church had stood on the spot before it burned to the ground. At the time, this area was heavily populated with immigrant families, struggling to get by. Up the street, there was once a Catholic church. Down this way, there was another Episcopal church, not to mention Trinity and St. Paul\u2019s. Remember, everyone went to church in those days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, Greta. Anyway,\u201d Hank said, flashing a grin at Professor Laymon, \u201cthe decision was made that our good friend here should head the project, and all work has been stopped, the areas where the finds were made have been cordoned off, and you\u2019re all set to go. And\u2014\u201d he offered another of his broad smiles to Leslie \u201c\u2014we have two of the city\u2019s most esteemed archaeologists on the case, along with whatever hordes the professor cares to hire.\u201d He turned to Brad. \u201cSo do speak highly of us to the press, please.\u201d</p><p>Greta laughed softly; Leslie smiled. It seemed to her that Hank was honest enough, even if she didn\u2019t always trust developers herself.</p><p>\u201cYou know, construction workers need to make a living, too,\u201d Robert piped in.</p><p>\u201cRight. Some of us poor slobs are just worker bees,\u201d Ken said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, poor Ken. You\u2019re just the average worker bee, right?\u201d Leslie teased.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cOkay, so, I\u2019m a lucky, well-educated worker bee. Talk to Robert, here, though, if you\u2019re looking for a guy who has worked his ass off\u2014sorry, Greta\u2014to get somewhere, and despite all he\u2019s done, he\u2019s got a tough job, nowhere near enough respect and a lousy paycheck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Robert protested.</p><p>\u201cOh, we cops are suddenly well paid?\u201d Ken said.</p><p>\u201cCould be worse,\u201d Robert told him.</p><p>Ken groaned.</p><p>\u201cBesides, I doubt you intend to be a cop forever,\u201d Robert said.</p><p>\u201cDo you have political aspirations?\u201d Leslie asked, sipping her wine.</p><p>\u201cNot this year, I assure you,\u201d Ken said. \u201cGreta, this is absolutely delicious. Thank you so much for inviting me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Greta said, waving a hand in the air, \u201cwe want Leslie to feel that the police are with her if she ever needs them, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreta is really worried about you staying at the house alone,\u201d Robert told Leslie. He didn\u2019t add and so am I. He didn\u2019t need to. She could see it in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cHey, I know New York City. I\u2019m street smart,\u201d Leslie assured them both.</p><p>\u201cAnyone can need help,\u201d Robert said.</p><p>\u201cShould I be afraid for some reason?\u201d Leslie asked. \u201cDo you know something I don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Robert said.</p><p>\u201cWell, we still haven\u2019t gotten to the bottom of those local disappearances,\u201d Ken said.</p><p>\u201cLeslie doesn\u2019t need to worry. She doesn\u2019t exactly fit the profile,\u201d Robert said.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s still been no break in the prostitute case?\u201d Leslie asked. \u201cIs that what you\u2019re talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no break,\u201d Ken said. He hesitated. \u201cMatt had people concerned, but no one has picked up where he left off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince Leslie is hardly likely to start walking the streets soliciting, I don\u2019t think she needs to worry too much about that,\u201d Greta announced. \u201cI mean, personally. Of course we all need to worry in the larger sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe there\u2019s a modern-day Jack the Ripper out there,\u201d Brad offered.</p><p>\u201cJack the Ripper got his kicks by letting others discover the butchered bodies of his victims,\u201d Robert said sharply, then flushed, hearing his own tone. \u201cSorry, this is a real sore spot with me. We\u2019re just not getting anywhere. And whenever we think it might have stopped, we get another distant relative, hooker friend or embarrassed john down at the station, talking about a girl who\u2019s just vanished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe they\u2019re just moving on,\u201d Brad suggested.</p><p>\u201cI wish that were the case,\u201d Robert said. \u201cI just don\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t we finding any bodies, then?\u201d Ken asked him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Robert said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to make you uneasy, Leslie,\u201d he added, turning to her.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t. I have a state-of-the-art alarm here, remember?\u201d she asked, smiling.</p><p>But Robert still seemed disturbed as he stared at her.</p><p>Shortly afterward, their dishes were removed and coffee was served, along with a delicious apple cobbler. As dessert was set down, Leslie decided that she was going to lighten the mood. \u201cSo...anything new and exciting going on in anyone\u2019s social life?\u201d she asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Apparently it wasn\u2019t the right light question.</p><p>\u201cWhat social life?\u201d Ken asked. \u201cDo you have one of those, Robert?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019m here for dinner tonight,\u201d Robert said. \u201cThanks to this gracious lady,\u201d he added, reaching across the table and squeezing Greta\u2019s hand.</p> <p>\u201cGreta\u2019s whole life is social, but since she works so hard at it, she doesn\u2019t have an actual social life, either,\u201d Hank teased.</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d Greta said. \u201cI\u2019m a happy woman.

Hey, we do start tomorrow morning, right, Professor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to kick us out?\u201d Brad asked.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t really kick you out. It isn\u2019t my house. But, yes, please leave. I need to go to bed,\u201d she told him, grinning.</p><p>Robert Adair looked at Brad. \u201cI guess she\u2019s serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like,\u201d Brad agreed with a shrug.</p><p>There were a lot of goodbyes, with everyone making sure she had their numbers programmed into her cell phone and forcing her to promise that she would call right away if she needed anything.</p> <p>Greta insisted on walking through the downstairs and making sure the caterers had cleaned up to her satisfaction and turned off all the appliances, and that the doors and windows were all locked. She explained the alarm and gave the code to Leslie, while the others hovered in the entryway. At last, even Greta was willing to admit that all was well.</p><p>\u201cNow, tomorrow is Monday. The house opens at ten, so Melissa Turner arrives at around eight-thirty\u2014she\u2019s in charge of ticket sales\u2014and Tandy Goren and Jeff Green\u2014the historical guides\u2014usually get here a bit after. Melissa comes in and makes her coffee early. She\u2019s one of those people who likes to get to work ahead of schedule so she can take her time. She\u2019s a sweetheart\u2014you\u2019ll love her. Just don\u2019t be startled when you hear voices early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may already be gone,\u201d Leslie said. She looked at Laymon. \u201cWhat time are we meeting at the site, Professor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake your time tomorrow. Ten will be fine,\u201d Professor Laymon said. \u201cYou know where it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDown the street. I don\u2019t think I can miss it.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cYes, well, just dial my cell if you don\u2019t see where we are. I want to make my general assessment, then I\u2019ll get you and Brad going while I take care of hiring some grad students and start with the other what-have-yous.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, waiting anxiously for them to leave.</p><p>Ken Dryer brushed sandy hair from his forehead and took her hand. \u201cI\u2019m still a cop,\u201d he said huskily. \u201cYou know you can count on me if you need anything.\u201d</p> <p>Let go of her hand, dickhead!</p><p>Ken frowned suddenly, then shrugged. \u201cCall me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said.</p><p>Hank stepped forward. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m not a cop, but I\u2019m always around if you need me, anyway.\u201d He kissed her cheek.</p><p>You are the dickhead of all dickheads!</p><p>Hank suddenly seemed to stumble. \u201cJust let me know if you need me,\u201d he said.</p><p>Robert hugged her easily; Brad bussed her cheek. \u201cSee you tomorrow, kid.\u201d</p><p>Greta hugged her fiercely. Leslie felt as if she were about to leave on a safari into the deepest jungle. They were all so worried. And she couldn\u2019t possibly explain why she so badly wanted to stay in the house.</p><p>Alone.</p><p>At last the good-nights were ending. Robert Adair continued to look troubled. She kissed his cheek. \u201cWe\u2019ll have dinner soon, how\u2019s that?\u201d she whispered to him.</p><p>That seemed to brighten him. He nodded.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really good to see you back, Leslie,\u201d he said gravely.</p><p>\u201cBack in New York. Back with us all,\u201d Ken Dryer added.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cThis is home,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>Finally they left and she was alone in the house.</p><p>She stood in the entry. She could still hear the street noises, muffled by the fence and the thick walls of the house. The sound of a horn, a shout, a car alarm. The usual.</p><p>She forced those noises into the background and tried to hear the house itself.</p><p>Nothing. Everything was quiet. Not even an old board creaked.</p><p>Hastings House had stood for more than two centuries. It had seen war, peace, life, love...and death. It had to be filled with a few spirits. It had been witness to a revolution, to a civil war that had torn a country apart. It had been there in 1812 when a fledgling nation had faced its first major confrontation following its independence. It had witnessed riots, the teeming disturbance of a world gone crazy in the caste war pitting old immigrants against new. World wars had come and gone, and the Cold War after them. It had survived the tragedy and trials of the twenty-first century.</p><p>There had to be spirits here....</p><p>But she heard, sensed, nothing. The house was silent.</p><p>\u201cMatt?\u201d she whispered hopefully.</p><p>But there was no reply.</p><p>She closed her eyes, prayed, hoped, waited.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>At last she went up to bed.</p><p>There are no rules, Nikki had told her once. No one really knew what lay beyond this world.</p><p>She lay awake as long as she could, still and expectant.</p><p>But nothing happened, and without even noticing the transition from wakefulness, she finally fell asleep.</p><p>4</p><p>A t three in the morning, Joe was trolling the streets, driving slowly, looking for his one hooker in a veritable sea of them.</p><p>He\u2019d started doing the basics immediately. Checking and double-checking the information Eileen had given him, making appointments, sending e-mails...</p><p>He\u2019d read the magazine article several times over but had found nothing but an allusion to a long-ago rumor of an extramarital affair\u2014not enough to make an intelligent grown woman go berserk, surely. The reporter was currently on assignment overseas, so there was no way to get hold of him to see how much he really knew.</p><p>Joe didn\u2019t think he was going to get much help from that quarter, anyway.</p><p>The secret to Genevieve\u2019s whereabouts was out here somewhere on the streets.</p><p>One of the notes Eileen had given him referred to a hooker Genevieve had tried to help in the course of her job and had actually spoken about to her aunt. Didi Dancer. Probably not the girl\u2019s real name, but...</p><p>Five foot four, huge breasts, tiny waist, liked to wear a skin-tight red skirt and leather jacket when she worked. Spiked heels. Her vanity was her hair, long and a rich, vibrant brown; she wouldn\u2019t be hard to spot.</p><p>He saw the woman and pulled over to the curb. She noticed that he was driving a Lexus, and he noted the hard smile that curved her lips as she walked over to the car. She leaned against it, arching her body suggestively as she did so.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she said. Then her hard smile eased a bit. \u201cSo, good-looking, what are you up to tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to talk to you,\u201d he said.</p><p>She had pretty features. Her skin was dry and taut, though. Too many cigarettes. Maybe\u2014probably\u2014too many less legal substances, as well. \u201cTalk? Sure, honey, everyone wants to talk.\u201d</p><p>He smiled; her own grin deepened. \u201cHey,\u201d she said again, her voice growing husky. \u201cYou really are good-looking, sugar. Maybe we can work out a good deal\u2014for talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly, I really do just want to talk, but I\u2019ll make it worth your while.\u201d</p><p>She tensed suddenly, started to straighten. \u201cYou\u2019re fucking vice, aren\u2019t you? I haven\u2019t said a thing. You can\u2019t run me in.\u201d</p><p>She started to walk away, heels clicking sharply on the pavement.</p><p>He hopped quickly out of the car. \u201cI swear to God, I\u2019m not vice. And I will make it worth your while. You\u2019re, uh, Didi Dancer, right?\u201d Man, what a ridiculous name.</p><p>She paused, then turned back, staring at him across the sidewalk.</p><p>\u201cWho are you? What are you?\u201d she asked suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a private investigator. And I just need some help. I\u2019m looking for a missing girl. Genevieve O\u2019Brien.\u201d</p><p>A strange look washed over her face. Something containing caring and humanity.</p><p>Her voice still husky, she asked, \u201cThat pretty social worker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI talked to the cops, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you talk to me?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cAll right,\u201d she said at last. \u201cIf you\u2019ll take me for a ride. That\u2019s a cool car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>She crawled into the passenger seat, ran her hands over the soft leather, then looked at him.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you want to go?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cJust drive. Hey, let\u2019s take the FDR.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>He drove for several minutes, navigating the city streets to reach the highway, before she started to talk. \u201cThe police quizzed a lot of us about the missing hookers, you know. Strange. Well, not so strange. It was like it was all by rote. Questions they had to ask. They think we chose this life, that we deserve whatever happens to us.\u201d She shook her head, staring out the window. Then she looked back at him. \u201cCan I smoke in here?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cIf you can help me, you can light up a cigar,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She smiled, staring at him. \u201cYou are one handsome dude, you know? I should have known right off you weren\u2019t looking for a fuck. No, that\u2019s not true. You\u2019d be amazed at the really good-looking young guys who just want sex without any emotional bullshit. Or kinky things, or sometimes not even all that kinky. Just things their wives won\u2019t do.\u201d She frowned. \u201cYou really aren\u2019t vice, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear, I\u2019m not vice. I\u2019ll show you my ID.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, honey, anyone can fake ID,\u201d she said with a laugh. Then she sobered. \u201cI wish I could help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She opened her window and lit a cigarette. Exhaling, she began. \u201cGenevieve. The cops asked about her, too. Such a pretty name for such a pretty girl.\u201d She inhaled deeply, just air. At that moment she didn\u2019t even seem to realize she had a lit cigarette. \u201cI have a daughter. They took her away. She\u2019s in foster care. Genevieve came to see me. I gave her a hard time at first. The girl looks like she ought to be posing for Vogue or something like that. And I heard from some of the other girls that she\u2019s really rich, too...but she was the real deal. She really wanted to help me. Us. I even got her together with some of the other girls one time. She was so sweet. She wanted to know about our dreams, can you imagine that? Like, did we plan on doing what we\u2019re doing forever? Was it just to pull in some money? She wanted to help us get real jobs that paid enough to survive here. Enough to get legit. To get our kids back,\u201d she said softly.</p> <p>\u201cWhen was the last time you saw her?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cAbout a month ago.\u201d</p><p>Right around when she disappeared?</p><p>\u201cDid she visit you? Were you at a restaurant...on the street, what and where?\u201d Joe pursued quietly.</p><p>\u201cWe were right where you picked me up tonight,\u201d she told him. \u201cShe knew where to find me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy was she looking for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe thought she might have a job for me.\u201d Didi inhaled on her cigarette, exhaled the smoke, then flicked the butt out the window and looked at him. \u201cShe wanted to know if I was seriously\u2014really seriously\u2014ready to change my lifestyle. If I wanted my daughter back bad enough to stay clean. Squeaky clean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did you tell her?\u201d</p><p>She folded her hands in her lap and looked down at them. \u201cI said yes.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cBut she never came back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen and how did she leave you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA car pulled up, and I could tell she knew the driver. She walked over to it, and it looked like she and the guy\u2014I think it was a guy\u2014it looked like they were kinda arguing. I couldn\u2019t hear what they said, but she looked pissed, you know? Then she waved at me and said she\u2019d get back with me about the job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then she got in the car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can you tell me about the car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a dark sedan. Black, blue, something like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy any wild chance, did you get the plate number?\u201d</p><p>Didi shook her head. \u201cI wasn\u2019t looking. I...I didn\u2019t notice anything more.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t watch her go, maybe wave as she drove off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Didi said softly, then looked at him. \u201cAnother car showed up. A regular of mine. I knew the guy; knew he was worth money. I forgot all about Genevieve then. I had to. I mean, I seriously would have taken her offer, and I would have stayed clean. But...well, I needed to eat in the meantime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>He drove her back to the curb where he had found her. After he slid the car into neutral, he pulled out a wad of bills.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t owe me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI told you I\u2019d pay you to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was about Genevieve. You don\u2019t owe me. I really hope that you find her. I pray sometimes that she\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake the money, have some dinner. Give yourself a break.\u201d</p><p>She paused, looked into eyes, then took the money. \u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019m not just gonna buy some coke with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might. I hope you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She started to get out of the car. \u201cYou know, you\u2019re the only one who asked me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsked you what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I said to Genevieve. No one else cared if I meant to clean up or not. That was really nice of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could probably get yourself a real job, with or without Genevieve,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYeah? I have great references. \u2018John Q. says I\u2019m a great lay,\u2019\u201d she said dryly. She flushed, then dug into her small handbag. She produced a scrap of paper, a receipt from a coffee house, and scratched down a number. \u201cIf you think I can help you again, call me.\u201d</p><p>He accepted the paper. \u201cThank you. Are you sure you don\u2019t remember anything else about the car? Can you take a guess on the color?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlack. I think it was black,\u201d she said. Then she sighed. \u201cI\u2019m just not sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Thank you. Really.\u201d</p><p>She touched his face, her eyes soft. \u201cNo, thank you, sweetie. You treated me nice. Real nice. And I\u2019m serious. You call me.\u201d She gave him her dry smile once again. \u201cAnd that wasn\u2019t a come-on. Good night.\u201d</p><p>She hopped out of the car.</p><p>He drove on down the street, past the site of the new dig. At night, it seemed huge, protected behind quickly rigged barbed wire. Hardly aware of what he was doing, he slid into a spot along the curb, stepped out of the car and started walking, making mental notes as he went.</p><p>Eileen Brideswell might just be right. Her niece had been working with prostitutes in the same area where a number of hookers had gone missing. She had been picked up by a dark, probably black, sedan off the street\u2014in that same area. He needed Robert Adair\u2019s notes; he needed to know if any friends of the other missing girls had seen them getting into a dark sedan.</p><p>He kept walking, using the time as he often did to make sense of what he had learned.</p><p>He found himself standing in front of Hastings House once again, as if brought there by instinct.</p><p>Well, that was crazy as hell. What could Hastings House have to do with the disappearance of Genevieve O\u2019Brien?</p><p>The place just bugged him, that was all. He couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that the blast had been intentional and Matt had been the intended target.</p><p>And that someone was getting away with murder.</p><p>He stood beneath the streetlight, staring at the house. It seemed to live and breathe; the old colonial windows were like eyes, the door like a mouth.</p><p>Unease filled him. Eileen Brideswell was right, he thought. Her niece had been the victim of foul play. Just as the prostitutes had been.</p><p>Someone was getting away with murder.</p><p>Just like at Hastings House.</p><p>At first Leslie slept deeply. Then, suddenly, she discovered that she was wide awake.</p><p>She glanced at her travel alarm on the Duncan Fife reproduction by her bed. Four in the morning. Much too early to get out of bed.</p><p>She plumped her pillow, but sleep wouldn\u2019t come. After half an hour she sighed and gave up. She slipped on a robe and went quietly downstairs.</p><p>So far, she hadn\u2019t gone into the room where the explosion had taken place. Was she ready for that?</p><p>Did she want to reach Matt?</p><p>In the entryway, she hesitated, then went into the first room off the entryway, now set up as a Colonial parlor. There was a love seat beneath the window, a table in the center of the room, a pianoforte to one side, and various chairs, along with a tea table. She stood there in the shadows and the diffuse glow cast by the the security lights. \u201cHello?\u201d she said softly.</p><p>But the room was just a room, an image of a past that might or might not have been exactly as it was represented now.</p><p>She walked through the connecting door to the dining room, thinking that last night was now just a moment in history, like everything else.</p><p>Then she walked through the kitchen and back to the servants\u2019 pantry.</p><p>The hearth had been rebuilt. She could almost imagine Matt standing by it the way he had that night. She could almost see herself nearby, held captive in a different conversation. In her mind\u2019s eye, she could almost see...</p><p>But the room was silent. Just a room.</p><p>\u201cNot even a Colonial gentleman here, huh? The lady of the house?\u201d she said aloud.</p><p>Just an empty room.</p><p>She walked back into the kitchen, found the coffeepot and the coffee, and thought that if the supplies belonged to Melissa, the ticket-seller, she would make a point of replacing them. She set a pot of coffee on to brew. Upstairs, in her room, which wasn\u2019t part of any tour, she had a television. She could sip coffee and watch an early-morning news show soon.</p><p>That settled, she hummed while she made coffee, thinking that she might turn and see a ghost at any time. But the coffee brewed, and she saw nothing. She found a large cup, filled it, added cream that she found in the artfully disguised refrigerator and headed back up the stairs.</p><p>She set her coffee down and turned on the television, then walked to the window and looked idly down at the street. Her heart stopped.</p><p>There was a man on the sidewalk, standing under the streetlight.</p><p>Matt.</p><p>She blinked. He was still there. As tall as Matt, standing the exact way that Matt stood. It had to be Matt.</p><p>The man looked up.</p><p>Good God, it was Matt!</p><p>She forgot that she was wearing nothing but a robe over a short nightgown. She almost forgot about the alarm as she raced downstairs toward the front door, but at the last minute she suddenly realized that a siren would go off and the police would be alerted if she didn\u2019t punch in the code. She hit the numbers hastily, then threw open the door and ran down the walk.</p><p>At the picket fence, she slowed and swore softly. The man was gone.</p><p>She wrapped her robe more tightly around her body. The street was so quiet now.</p><p>Dead, actually.</p><p>She opened the gate and looked anxiously down the street. Nothing in either direction. The man under the streetlight must have been a trick of her imagination.</p><p>But if it had been Matt.... A ghost didn\u2019t have to run off down the street, so foolishly running around barefoot wouldn\u2019t do any good. But it probably hadn\u2019t been Matt; she had just wanted so badly to see him....</p><p>She let out a soft sigh. \u201cHello? Is anybody there?\u201d</p><p>She felt a soft breeze touch her face, heard the sound of a distant horn and someone shouting \u201cTaxi!\u201d</p><p>The city never really slept. Not even down here, in the financial district. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHello?\u201d she murmured again.</p><p>\u201cHi, yourself, lady.\u201d</p><p>She spun around. A filthy, toothless, long-haired bum was grinning as he stood behind her. \u201cI mean, hello, honey,\u201d he added.</p> <p>She looked him up and down, trying not to wrinkle her nose in distaste or scream in shock.</p><p>\u201cUh, hi,\u201d she said. \u201cBye.\u201d</p><p>With a wave, she fled back through the gate, taking a minute to latch it behind herself, and up the steps. Inside the house, she locked the door and keyed in the alarm, making a mental note to herself to start being really careful or people really would start thinking she was crazy.</p><p>At nine o\u2019clock on the nose, Joe Connolly was in the office of social services, speaking with the man who had been Genevieve\u2019s boss, a harried, irritable curmudgeon named Manny Yarborough who didn\u2019t seem inclined to be helpful.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already had an officer in here, and I can\u2019t tell you anything else. The girl quit. Cleared out her desk and quit. That\u2019s it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it. Did she say where she was going? Did she leave an address for her last check? Did she say that she\u2019d be in to get it? May I see her desk, her work area, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what, mister? I\u2019m a really busy man. We\u2019re always shorthanded around here, and Genevieve left us shorter. She didn\u2019t say anything. When I asked her not to leave that way, told her she had to work with the system and give notice, that she couldn\u2019t just quit, she just said, \u2018Watch me.\u2019 Then she grabbed her stuff and she walked. And you\u2019re crazy if you think I didn\u2019t put that desk right back to work the second she was out of this place. We need space, and we need help. This is New York!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need whatever address you have on file, and I\u2019d like to look at the desk anyway,\u201d Joe said firmly.</p><p>\u201cYou got a search warrant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2014do you think this is going to turn into a homicide investigation? I told you. I\u2019m not a cop, I\u2019m working for the family, a family that helps support the city charities, and I\u2019m sure you know that. How about you give me a hand, please?\u201d</p><p>The man looked at him in exasperation. \u201cI\u2019ll get you what I had for a phone and an address, and you can ask Alice over there if she minds if you look at her desk.\u201d</p> <p>Alice was young and looked uneasy. She seemed exceptionally kind, though, the type of person who was meant for her line of work. She was still idealistic. Her eyes were big and blue, and she must have heard the conversation, because she jumped out of her chair when Joe approached, eager to be of assistance. \u201cI can go get some coffee or something if you want. I mean, I can get out of your way.\u201d She was thin, and a little like a nervous terrier.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d really appreciate it if you could stay and tell me what I\u2019m looking at,\u201d he told her, offering what he hoped was a reassuring smile.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Manny walked away, as if disgusted with the whole thing.</p><p>Joe sat at the desk.</p><p>\u201cThe bottom drawer is files,\u201d Alice offered. \u201cI\u2019ll go through them with you.\u201d</p><p>He quickly discovered that Genevieve\u2019s work with the prostitutes seemed to have consumed her caseload, though, interestingly, she hadn\u2019t labeled them as prostitutes. She had listed the women as \u201cWorking temporary jobs\u201d or \u201cSeeking better opportunities.\u201d She had notes on all the children\u2014babies, mostly\u2014court documents listing when they had been taken by Children\u2019s Services and where they\u2019d been placed, and little notes everywhere. He found the file for Didi Dancer. Her baby girl had been taken six months ago. Maybe Dancer was her real name after all, because the child was listed as Dianna Dancer. There was one note in Didi\u2019s file that wasn\u2019t clipped to the others. It read, She has a chance. Go for the big guns.</p><p>A second later, he heard a cough. He and Alice both looked up. Manny was back, scowling fiercely. \u201cMr. Connolly, here is the information I promised you. Now, I believe I\u2019ve offered you every courtesy. We are an under-paid service here, and time is valuable.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t minded helping Mr. Connolly at all,\u201d Alice assured him, her eyes still innocently wide.</p><p>\u201cYes, but you are due in court on the Blalock case in thirty minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn thirty minutes?\u201d Alice said with dismay. She jumped up again. Joe decided she was more like a nervous hamster than a terrier. He stood, as well. As he rose, he palmed the scrap of paper with Genevieve\u2019s note. Later, he could always say he hadn\u2019t taken it on purpose.</p><p>He managed to whisper to Alice, \u201cCan you copy the files for me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She looked delighted to be involved in a secret conspiracy against her boss. She nodded, eyes shining, a smile playing at her lips.</p><p>\u201cAlice, time is passing here,\u201d Manny said.</p><p>\u201cThank you both,\u201d Joe said politely, adding, \u201cI may be back.\u201d</p><p>Manny scowled.</p><p>Joe decided to retreat and fight another day. He extended a hand to Manny. \u201cThanks. I\u2019m praying I\u2019ll find Miss O\u2019Brien alive, and if I do, it will be in large part thanks to your help.\u201d What a load of bullshit. Still, he\u2019d learned over the years. He was never obsequious\u2014that would be too much; he would have to vomit on the spot. But being cordial to guys like this one usually made them feel awkward and sometimes even more willing to help in the future.</p><p>He extended a hand to Alice, as well, thanking her sincerely. She flushed and stuttered. \u201cY-you\u2019re very welcome. I loved Genevieve. We all did. Do, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and now we all need to get back to work,\u201d Manny said.</p><p>Joe gave Alice a wink, and she smiled broadly. He left.</p><p>He had his cell phone out and was calling Robert Adair before he even left the building. Luck was with him. He didn\u2019t lose his signal in the elevator, and Robert answered immediately.</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to you about Genevieve O\u2019Brien and the missing prostitutes,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Robert said.</p><p>\u201cI said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I heard you. But...Genevieve wasn\u2019t a prostitute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Humor me,\u201d Joe said, quite sure that Robert had made the same connection he had but wasn\u2019t about to give anything away.</p><p>\u201cAll right. I\u2019m at the site. Can you meet me here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat site?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, what site? The new dig site. The Big New York Dig, they\u2019re calling it.\u201d Robert was silent for a second, then added, \u201cDown by Hastings House.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in a few,\u201d Joe said, and hung up.</p><p>Leslie was filthy, but she barely noticed and certainly didn\u2019t care. She was alive with the thrill of discovery that had been part of her chosen vocation from the very beginning. This place was an archaeological gold mine.</p><p>In a matter of hours they had laid out their grid, and Laymon had taken on a number of professionals, using all the people from the museum who were already involved and twenty grad students from local universities. People were down on their knees with small trowels and delicate brushes, while heavy machinery stood silently by. Thus far, they had found shoe buckles, belt buckles and fragments of jewelry.</p><p>Leslie was sure there would be lots more.</p><p>At first she hadn\u2019t known why she was drawn to a particular section of the grid. But then, as she dug and then dusted, she had looked up...</p><p>And seen the child.</p><p>She must have been about seven. She was hugging a handmade, unbleached muslin doll. Her hair was in a single braid. She was very thin, and her legs were slightly bowed. Rickets, Leslie thought. She had stared at the child for several seconds before she realized she was seeing someone none of the others could.</p><p>A ghost child.</p><p>She smiled, hoping no one noticed as she whispered, \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>The little girl had huge brown eyes. She was dressed in a calico print dress and a spotless apron. She hugged the doll more tightly and mouthed back, \u201cHello. You can see me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say, Leslie?\u201d Brad, just a few feet away but luckily with his back to her, asked.</p><p>\u201cUh, nothing. How are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he replied, then turned back to his work.</p><p>Leslie smiled at the child again. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeautiful name,\u201d Leslie said.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Brad demanded again.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking to yourself again,\u201d Brad said with a sigh, staring at her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just singing. It passes the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well...you can\u2019t carry a tune, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I\u2019ll avoid karaoke clubs, then.\u201d</p><p>He made a grunting sound of irritation, rolled his eyes and went back to work.</p><p>She was afraid that Mary would be gone, but the ghostly child had remained. She was grinning. \u201cI\u2019m sure you sing just fine, miss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cAre you lost?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where my mother is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas she...sick?\u201d</p><p>The little girl nodded gravely.</p><p>\u201cAnd were you sick, too?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and looked troubled. \u201cI think my mother died. I think I came here with my father when she died. But I can\u2019t find her now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think that her grave was here...right here, where I am now?\u201d</p><p>The girl pointed a few feet away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find her. When I do, Mary, they\u2019ll take her away for a bit. But...I\u2019ll find you, too. And I\u2019ll make sure, in the end, that they keep you together.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cMary...you know that you\u2019re...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m dead. Yes, I know. I just want my mother.\u201d</p><p>Despite herself and everything she knew, Leslie felt a terrible chill. The sun was bright. It was a beautiful day. She was glad she was surrounded by people. Real live people.</p><p>Brad was standing, dusting his hands on his khakis. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She made a face at him. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to move right over there. Want to give me a hand? We\u2019ll need to dig a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hunch. Instinct. I don\u2019t know. But I want to try over there.\u201d</p> <p>He looked both skeptical and annoyed, but he joined her nonetheless.</p><p>They began to work in silence. Leslie looked up, intending to smile and reassure the child again, but the little girl was gone.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how long she worked, she was so absorbed in what she was doing. And then, at last, she hit a fragment of wood.</p><p>\u201cBrad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLook.\u201d She dusted the piece and handed it to him. \u201cCoffin?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s keep going.\u201d</p><p>A minute later he let out a hoarse cry. He\u2019d come across a piece so big it could actually be termed a board.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re on it,\u201d Leslie murmured.</p><p>\u201cDelicately, delicately now...just the brushes, no matter how long it takes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, I know. How long have we worked together?\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t even look up.</p><p>She found the first bone. A breastbone. They both stopped and looked at each other.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go a little farther,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She nodded. They went back to work, meticulously, slowly. Her back ached, but she scarcely noticed the discomfort. Minutes passed. Eventually they revealed the skeletal remains of a woman. Bits and pieces of fabric had also survived the ravages of time and the worms of the grave. And a cross. A simple gold cross. Very tiny, a poor woman\u2019s treasure.</p><p>About to get up and summon the others, Leslie realized that they were already surrounded. Silently, and one by one, about twenty people, including Professor Laymon, Robert Adair and Hank Smith, had circled carefully around their position.</p><p>\u201cUm, well, it\u2019s definitely a graveyard,\u201d Leslie said.</p><p>\u201cWe knew there was a church here. It\u2019s a churchyard. There will be lots of graves, and, with luck, they\u2019ll reveal volumes of new understanding about the area,\u201d Professor Laymon said, pleased.</p><p>Leslie wondered if Hank Smith felt happy. He shouldn\u2019t. This would put his project on hold for some time.</p> <p>But Hank Smith was smooth, a man who had apparently learned never to give his true emotions away. His face revealed absolutely nothing of whatever he was feeling.</p><p>Laymon, however, looked as if he were about to have an orgasm.</p><p>\u201cOh. My. God,\u201d he breathed. He sounded like a Valley girl, Leslie thought with a smile. \u201cAll right, we\u2019ll need to get the photographers over here...and the news crews.\u201d He frowned. He didn\u2019t want anyone trampling on what he now considered to be his territory, but they could always use the publicity, and, anyway, there was no way not to allow the press at least some access, especially since it was the good PR that kept the developers happy. \u201cSergeant Adair, will you post a guard, please? And when we bring her up, I want her in situ...the dirt around her and beneath her.\u201d</p><p>Laymon definitely looked as if he belonged in a laboratory somewhere\u2014or filming a mad scientist movie\u2014Leslie thought. He was in a smudged white lab coat, his glasses were sitting halfway down his nose, and his hair was dusty and sticking out at odd angles. She smiled. The man certainly got into his work.</p><p>Hank Smith reached down to help her up the little incline from where she\u2019d been digging. She hesitated, worrying about leaving Mary\u2019s mother alone.</p><p>\u201cLeslie, come on up. I promise, you\u2019ll get to oversee as soon as the photographers are done,\u201d Laymon said.</p><p>She grinned at Hank Smith and accepted his hand, then found herself apologizing. He was wearing a suit that appeared to be the most haute of designer apparel, even if it had been designed for business. He looked like a million bucks in it. \u201cI\u2019m going to ruin your clothing. I\u2019m a mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a beautiful mess,\u201d he said politely, and grinned. \u201cIn fact, you can mess me up any time you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she murmured, unsure just how to take his words.</p><p>Brad had stepped up on his own; others were milling closer.</p><p>Leslie noted that Robert Adair had walked off. She frowned, trying to see where he had gotten to.</p><p>\u201cSmile,\u201d Hank whispered to her, drawing her close. A reporter had arrived. Leslie found herself standing between Hank and Laymon, and the men slipped their arms around her quickly. A flash went off.</p><p>Great.</p><p>\u201cHey, Miss MacIntyre, you\u2019re getting famous for finding bones,\u201d a slender young newswoman called to her. \u201cHow did you find this lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe site was found for me,\u201d she returned.</p><p>\u201cWant to escape?\u201d Hank Smith whispered to her.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cBrad and Laymon can handle this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss MacIntyre\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk to my partner, please, I\u2019ve got to get...uh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on. There\u2019s a trailer right over there,\u201d Hank said. He waved a hand to the reporter. \u201cExcuse us, please.\u201d</p><p>He led her firmly away from the crowd, maneuvering with a surprising expertise through the stakes and ropes that then divided the site until they reached the trailer, parked near the street. It had been put there originally for the convenience of the building crew, she realized as he ushered her in.</p><p>The trailer was light and bright, offering a work station, kitchenette and table. \u201cTake a seat, relax. I can get you water, soda, iced tea. Even wine, beer...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIced tea sounds really great.\u201d</p><p>He offered her a bottle and took one for himself, then crossed the trailer to open the plain cotton drapes. \u201cI guess they\u2019ll be there for a bit.\u201d He let the drape fall. \u201cWell.\u201d He sat across from her at the work station. \u201cYou really do have a nose for homing in on the past, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously, the site was there. And all those other sections of the grid? We\u2019ll find more, believe me. I just happened to be in the right place at the right time, as they say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like you happen to be in the right place at the right time a lot,\u201d he said pleasantly. Then he hesitated. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, you were in the hospital a long time, not in the right place at all the night that...I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to make you remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. I never really forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019d love to hear about Virginia sometime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a great state.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you made a great find there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was pretty exciting,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cAn old churchyard...and here you are, proving there\u2019s another old churchyard right here. I\u2019d love to hear more about how you do it sometime. Maybe you\u2019ll go to lunch with me one day.\u201d</p><p>She started to protest, but he lifted a hand. \u201cLook, you\u2019re a bright and, let\u2019s face it, gorgeous woman, but I know you\u2019re not interested in dating. So I\u2019m not asking you on a date. I\u2019d just like to buy you lunch one of these days.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYes, then. Someday you can take me to lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince you won\u2019t date, maybe you can teach me more about figuring out women,\u201d he said, shaking his head in dramatic bewilderment.</p><p>\u201cHank, you\u2019re rich, important and a handsome guy,\u201d she said dryly. \u201cI\u2019m sure your life is full of women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, full, but...which one is the right one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I can help you with that. Hey, are you upset that we made the find? This has to be costing you, I know.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cHonestly, we can spin this so that every state in the union wants to see our bids when they have a project coming up. Some people get testy when a building is put on hold. I may think, \u2018Damn, how did we pick another blankety-blank historic site?\u2019 for a few minutes, but then I move on. The world is what it is. And yes, it runs on money, so I like money. But perception is important, and creating the perception that we\u2019re humanitarians, conservationists, is good business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, here\u2019s to your excellent spin-doctoring and perception, then. Cheers,\u201d she said, lifting her bottle of tea to his.</p><p>\u201cCheers. Though this should be champagne,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cTo tell you the truth, I like the taste of tea much better,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAre you a total teetotaler?\u201d he asked with mock horror.</p><p>\u201cNot at all. Just give me a good beer and a slice of pizza any day,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cA down-home girl, huh?\u201d</p><p>Hank was nice, she thought, but things were beginning to feel a little bit too chummy.</p><p>She rose and walked over to the window, looking out. She could see Robert Adair standing out on the sidewalk, on the other side of the fence, talking earnestly to a tall, light-haired man. Her heart began to thud. Tall and light-haired\u2014like Matt. His head was bowed in concentration, as Matt\u2019s had so often been. He looked up. Matt\u2019s features. Not...</p><p>He said something to Robert, thanking him, she thought. Then he turned away.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d she cried.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Hank demanded.</p><p>\u201cThat man...Excuse me, Hank, but I have to get to Robert....\u201d The trailer was narrow; she almost stumbled over him in her haste to get away.</p><p>\u201cLeslie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks!\u201d she called over her shoulder. \u201cSee you later.\u201d</p><p>She streaked across the site, avoiding the ropes and stakes of the grid out of habit. She headed straight for the fence.</p><p>But Robert was gone.</p><p>And the other man was gone, too.</p><p>As if he had never been.</p><p>As if he were...</p><p>A ghost.</p><p>5</p><p>T hat night, he came to her at last, but not as she could ever have expected.</p><p>It was late when she left the dig. Her hasty exit from the trailer had exposed her to the reporters again, and there had been more pictures to be taken. This time she posed with Brad. Inevitably, there had been questions about the events of last year, and even some unexpected concern about her health. She was grateful to realize, during the course of the questioning, that no one had mentioned that she had chosen to stay at Hastings House, so she was spared any inquiries on that score. Still, the whole thing seemed to take forever, and she was longing for a shower and solitude. She realized, however, that she had been given an opportunity to remind everyone that this had been a graveyard and the remains found here deserved to be treated with respect and consideration. \u201cI\u2019m hoping we can put some families back together again,\u201d she was able to say. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Finally it was over.</p><p>Laymon had ordered pizzas for everyone who wanted to stay, so, still dirty and very tired, they crowded into the trailer, ate and called it a day.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk you home,\u201d Brad told her.</p> <p>\u201cI live down the block,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019ll walk you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a New Yorker and can take care of myself,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>He looked straight ahead. \u201cI don\u2019t know.

I\u2019ll see you in, and then I can stand on the curb and pray for a cab or just wander over to Broadway and get one. And thanks, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tossed all the press attention in my direction again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re partners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you\u2019re the one who always knows where to dig. Anyway, the limelight finds you no matter what. The reporters love you. You\u2019re young and gorgeous, and you dig up the dead. That kind of thing fascinates people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t dig up the dead, I dig up history,\u201d she said.</p> <p>He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cAnd besides, you\u2019re young and gorgeous, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for noticing,\u201d he told her, laughing.</p><p>She laughed, too, and they walked arm in arm to the house.</p><p>He saw her to the door and left her. The moment he was gone, she dialed Robert\u2019s number.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked immediately.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. You home? Or at Hastings House, I mean.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a zoo out there today. A good zoo, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I guess. So...what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...Robert...\u201d She hesitated, trying to sound light. \u201cYou haven\u2019t started seeing ghosts, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He sounded astonished\u2014and then worried again. \u201cLeslie, what are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was that man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one you were talking to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeslie, I talked to dozens of men today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis afternoon. Out on the sidewalk near the site.\u201d</p><p>Did he hesitate for just a second? Was she imagining that he sounded suspicious when he answered?</p><p>\u201cI think you know most of the people I talked to today. Hank, Dryer...maybe you saw me talking to him? Let\u2019s see, I talked with Brad a couple of times, with Laymon...a really cute grad student\u2014but she was no man. Hmm. A not-so-cute grad student, some other cops, a P.I., a nosy businessman...a guy driving a double-parked limo....\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, sorry. Never mind,\u201d Leslie said.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you\u2019re all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m great. Actually, I\u2019m tired and filthy, but at least I\u2019m not hungry\u2014we had pizza. I\u2019m sorry I bothered you, Robert. I\u2019m going to clean up and go to bed. But enough about me. How are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m great. No, no, I\u2019m not,\u201d he said, and she could hear the rueful humor in his voice. \u201cHalf the time I\u2019m so frustrated I could scream, but then again, I\u2019m an old cop, and I\u2019m accustomed to that feeling. I\u2019ll tell you what. When I take you to dinner, I\u2019ll pour my heart out, how\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds fine,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cGood night, then. You call me if you need me. And ask me anything. Anytime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a doll. And you know I will. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>She clicked off, then stood in the entryway and looked around. The house was so quiet it seemed almost unnatural.</p><p>\u201cSomeone has to be here,\u201d she said aloud. But if they were, apparently they had no intention of showing themselves to her.</p><p>She went upstairs and showered. Afterward, drying her hair, she turned on the television. She\u2019d no idea it had gotten quite so late, but the ten o\u2019clock news was on. She got to see herself, Brad, Laymon, a few of the excited grad students and Dryer, who announced that the police were excited by the discovery, like everyone else, and that there would be a large police presence in the area. New York would be preserved for New Yorkers. The city wouldn\u2019t stand for vandalism or interference.</p><p>At last, with the television on, she fell asleep.</p><p>And that was when he came to her.</p><p>In dreams.</p><p>She slept, and he was there.</p><p>She knew that she dreamed, but the dreaming was sweet and real. She felt his presence as he spooned his body around her, just as they had so often slept when he was alive. His arms were around her, and she could feel the soft seduction of his breath against her nape. She smiled. \u201cI knew that you would come. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>He brushed his knuckles across her cheek, caressed the length of her back, stroked soothingly along her spine.</p><p>She turned into his arms, felt his kiss. Hungry, erotic, just as it had always been when they were apart for any length of time. A kiss that spoke volumes. Strong and powerful, liquid and ardent. His embrace was strong, reassuring, somehow gentle, like the power of his passion, and she slid into that embrace as if they had never been apart. She returned his kiss with the love that had lain dormant in the painful corridors of her heart ever since...</p><p>But she knew she was only dreaming.</p><p>She broke the kiss, lips moving the slightest distance away.</p><p>\u201cI love you so much,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t you come to me? Speak to me? Why has it taken you so long? Why can I only dream about you?\u201d she whispered. \u201cI see so many others....\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not like any of the others,\u201d he told her, and he smiled, that rakish, rueful smile. He was such a combination of assurance and humility.</p><p>\u201cMatt...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh...\u201d</p><p>And then his lips were against hers once again. So loving, so passionate.</p><p>As their lips locked, their hands bumped as they drew her nightgown over her head, both of them working to get the garment out of the way. And then she was against him, flesh against flesh, and he was warm and vital, hard muscle and taut sinew, his heartbeat thundering in rhythm with her own. She let her fingers play over his shoulders, slide down his back, clasp his buttocks. In turn, he drew her even closer, fitting her body to his own. It seemed as if they kissed forever, lips locked, bodies straining to be ever closer, as if they could crawl inside each other. She touched him...and touched him....</p><p>It was sweet and aching and poignant.</p><p>And it was a dream....</p><p>At last he pulled away, an apparition in her mind, but one that seemed so real. She met his eyes for a moment, the deep, dark, dazzling blue eyes that had so teased and loved her throughout most of her life. \u201cRebel,\u201d he breathed. \u201cDamn, I\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>She stroked a strand of hair away from his eyes.</p><p>\u201cThere really is no life without you,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYes, there is. There has to be,\u201d he told her. And then his lips curved into that smile that always took her breath away. \u201cBut not tonight.\u201d</p><p>And then he began to make love to her, his lips caressing her flesh, tender, provocative. His fingertips danced along her arms, her collarbone, her breasts. Delicate kisses followed, growing more forceful, teasing...the stroke of his tongue, the brush of his teeth, his lips...barely there, so that she strained toward him in search of sensation.</p><p>He moved against her, her wraith of the night, his flesh and vitality eliciting her own growing arousal. As intimate as he had always been, his kisses found her abdomen, the brush of his hair teasing her midriff. His hands moved down her inner thighs, spreading them wide as he lowered his head, leaving a whisper of sweet wet fire everywhere his mouth fell. She felt the spiraling ache of longing grow until it approached madness, and she strained against him, whispered his name, threaded her fingers through his hair. He made love to her with the hot wired tension of his body and the searing caress of his lips and tongue, until she was writhing and whispering and finally all but sobbing his name.</p><p>And then he rose above her again before driving into her with the passion she had never forgotten.</p><p>Her arms were locked around him, her hips rocking with his. His hands cradled her buttocks, pulling her against him, until it seemed they really had become one. She arched, quivered, her heart thundering as she strove to get even closer to him, soaring on a cloud of dreams and ecstasy. His mouth found hers again, melding against it just as she melded into him. He stroked and drove deeper, until the fire seemed to consume her. She wanted it go on forever, wanted to reach the promised climax, to know that shattering moment of completion once again....</p><p>Finally it came. She cried out his name, shuddering as the world seemed to explode around her, within her. And she felt him, felt him, as he tensed, frame hard as steel, haunches taut and straining. She heard the hoarse cry that fell from his lips, felt him as he fell against her, drawing her fully into his arms once again, holding her.</p><p>\u201cMatt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Matt...\u201d</p><p>His arms were still around her. His fingers smoothed back the dampness of her hair. \u201cSleep,\u201d he whispered. \u201cDream.\u201d</p><p>And there in his arms, she did.</p><p>In the morning, of course, she woke alone.</p><p>But the dream was fresh in her mind.</p><p>She lay in bed, staring at the ceiling. Maybe dreams were better than nothing, than the loss, the ache of loneliness, that never seemed to leave her.</p><p>Or maybe, as Brad had told her, she needed to come to terms with the past, to get on with her life.</p><p>She rose, showered and dressed for a day in the trenches in jeans, a blue denim shirt and sneakers. They were on to a treasure. But even the excitement of discovery seemed to lie dormant in her heart compared to the dream, which, she had to admit, had shaken her badly.</p><p>Downstairs, she was greeted by humming. Cheerful humming. Perky, cheerful humming. When she entered the kitchen, she got her first glance of Melissa Turner. The young woman was busy at the coffeepot. She had short brown hair and was a little on the stout side, comfortably dressed in serviceable deck shoes, a calf-length skirt and a white blouse. The tune she was humming was \u201cYankee Doodle.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d been running the water for the coffee, which was probably why she hadn\u2019t heard Leslie come down. When she turned, she jumped and screamed dramatically, staring with wide brown eyes at Leslie.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to startle you,\u201d Leslie said.</p><p>\u201cStartle me? You scared me out of ten years of life,\u201d Melissa replied. She had a death grip on the coffee urn. Probably a good thing. It might have crashed to the floor otherwise.</p> <p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not a ghost,\u201d Melissa said, still staring.</p><p>Leslie shook her head, half smiling, half frowning. \u201cNo, I\u2019m Leslie MacIntyre. Didn\u2019t they tell you? I\u2019m staying here while I work on the new dig site. You were expecting a ghost?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they told me. I just forgot. And, well, I think this place has to be haunted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Leslie murmured.</p><p>\u201cOh, Lord, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Melissa said awkwardly. \u201cI meant...ghosts from the Revolutionary War. The gang wars. Old ghosts.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Leslie said. Melissa was trying so hard and seemed so earnest that she almost laughed aloud. \u201cIt\u2019s a very historic house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIncredibly historic,\u201d Melissa agreed. \u201cAnd you\u2014you\u2019re an archaeologist,\u201d Melissa said, her tone filled with reverence.</p><p>\u201cYes. You\u2019ll see lots of them around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot of your caliber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had some luck,\u201d Leslie admitted.</p><p>\u201cLuck? You\u2019re a mile above the rest.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve just had a few more years at it than some, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Melissa stared back at her, looking unconvinced.</p><p>\u201cHow about you finish making that coffee? I\u2019d love a cup. And if you\u2019re the one buying the supplies, please let me chip in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be happy to pay for your coffee,\u201d Melissa told her.</p><p>Leslie hesitated, certain the Historical Society wasn\u2019t paying the girl much. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m happy to help out. I mean, you can\u2019t be making\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I make pure shit,\u201d Melissa said, then added quickly, \u201cOh, Lord, there I go again. I\u2019m sorry. I should just thank God they pay me enough to live on. I\u2019m not here for the money. I\u2019m here because I want to be. I love this place. I\u2019m fascinated by history, especially New York history.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you should be an archaeologist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSchool,\u201d Melissa said, grimacing. \u201cI can\u2019t afford it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell...there\u2019s got to be a way. You know that old saying. \u2018Where\u2019s there\u2019s a will\u2019 and all that. I can help you work on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d do that for me?\u201d Melissa asked in awe.</p><p>\u201cSure. And lots of the stuff we do, we use volunteers. That is, if you want to do volunteer work, after all the hours you put in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d die!\u201d Melissa said, then gasped. \u201cI mean...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMelissa, it\u2019s all right,\u201d Leslie said, stepping past the girl as she realized she would have to finish making the coffee herself.</p><p>\u201cGreta said that pretty soon she\u2019ll let me work one day a week as a guide. Thing is, the guides don\u2019t make any more than I do. The other guides are set for money. Tandy\u2019s husband makes a fortune. And Jeff Green is retired military, so he\u2019s got his pension. But I love the history of this place, and I swear, I\u2019d work here for free if I could afford to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure we can figure things out so you don\u2019t have to do that,\u201d Leslie promised. \u201cNow, do you use cream and sugar?\u201d</p><p>Melissa stopped and flushed. \u201cI guess I\u2019m preaching to the choir,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I think your enthusiasm\u2019s wonderful,\u201d Leslie assured her truthfully. She liked Melissa, loved her enthusiasm. She just had to get the girl to treat her like any other normal person.</p><p>\u201cCan you imagine, though, everything that must have happened in this place? With all the battles, all the fires, can you believe that it never burned to the ground? Even a modern-day explosion...oh, God. Sorry. There I go again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMelissa, just relax. Please.\u201d</p><p>The coffee was finally ready. Leslie poured two cups as Melissa stepped anxiously to her side.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all worried about you, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they don\u2019t need to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone says you and Matt were like a fairy-tale couple. So in love and\u2014oh, foot in mouth again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love him very much, and I like being here because I can think about him. I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m coming\u2014I\u2019ve come to terms with losing him. It\u2019s okay if you talk about him\u2014it\u2019s how we keep those we loved alive.\u201d</p><p>Melissa was silent for a moment as Leslie added cream to her coffee.</p><p>\u201cDo you see him?\u201d Melissa asked then.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey say that you...well, that you have some kind of ESP,\u201d Melissa said gravely.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re wrong,\u201d Leslie said. She wasn\u2019t lying, she told herself. It sure as hell wasn\u2019t ESP that she lived with every day.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Melissa sounded disappointed.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>Melissa sighed and sipped her coffee. \u201cHonestly...I\u2019d dreamed of being here with you and finding out that the place is haunted by a soldier from the Revolution, someone who died for his country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell you what. If I do come across a ghost, I\u2019ll be sure to get a good story from him\u2014or her.\u201d</p><p>Melissa flushed.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, I\u2019ll look into it. There are some great stories associated with this house. Did you know it was an Underground Railroad stop on the way to Canada during the Civil War? And it doesn\u2019t stand all that far from where the slave market was set up in 1711 at the foot of Wall Street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt got its name because the Dutch really did build a wall there,\u201d Melissa said. \u201cI know that because I\u2019m going to be a guide, but I guess you know it, too, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...yes,\u201d Leslie admitted as diplomatically as she could.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not scaring you away, am I?\u201d Melissa asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Leslie assured her. She glanced at her watch. \u201cBut I do have to get over to the site.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, we\u2019ll work on your future, okay? You\u2019ve got the love and commitment, and those are the most important things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. But right now I need to get going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you eat? Wow. That must be why you look like a twig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoughnuts on the job,\u201d Leslie assured her.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could eat doughnuts.\u201d</p><p>Leslie arched a brow, wondering if there was a right thing to say at such a moment. \u201cUm, I had a bad year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gain weight when I get depressed,\u201d Melissa said sadly.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we can get together and invent special sugar-free doughnuts,\u201d Leslie suggested.</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet. Unless you get home early tonight. Honestly, I haven\u2019t scared you into avoiding me, have I?\u201d Melissa asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cNo, I think you\u2019re very nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Leslie set down her cup and started out. Halfway along the hall toward the entryway, she stopped and stared. A man and woman in Colonial dress were entering, chatting with each other. They stopped and stared back at her.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d She strode forward, offering a hand. \u201cI\u2019m Leslie MacIntyre. You must be Tandy and Jeff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it. Hi,\u201d Tandy said. She had bright eyes, appeared to be a very attractive forty or so, and made a perfect Martha Washington. Her wig and hat fit well, and she looked completely authentic in the wide skirt and apron. The man was tall and lean, and also wore his wig naturally. They really could have been George and his missus.</p><p>\u201cMiss MacIntyre, a pleasure,\u201d Jeff Green said.</p><p>\u201cThanks so much. I\u2019m glad to get to meet you both, but I hope you\u2019ll excuse me. I\u2019m running late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Hope we get to see more of you later,\u201d Jeff said.</p><p>\u201cI hope so, too.\u201d</p><p>As she escaped, she could hear Jeff asking for coffee and Tandy excitedly asking Melissa what \u201cMiss MacIntyre\u201d was like and had they talked to any ghosts yet?</p><p>As she got closer to the site, she realized that hurrying was going to do her little good. Once again, there was a crowd around the gates. She wasn\u2019t even sure she wanted to press her way through it.</p><p>Reporters were in heavy evidence, and she found herself irritated. In a city like New York, there were a thousand things going on, so why were they all hanging around here? Then again, she supposed she should be glad that so many people seemed to have such an appreciation for the history of the city that history was making the news.</p><p>It was just that, despite what she\u2019d told Melissa, she was tired of all the questions about Matt and how she herself was coping.</p><p>Well, she had chosen to come back here, so she had no right to complain. She straightened her shoulders and headed straight for the gate, where most of the throng was standing.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, I\u2019m working here and I need to get through,\u201d she said, pushing her way past people.</p><p>Professor Laymon was standing in the middle of the dig, holding court in front of a group of journalists, with Brad at his side. She didn\u2019t want to steal anyone\u2019s thunder, but maybe it would be better to get the interest in her over and done with. She strode toward the two of them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Leslie MacIntyre,\u201d someone whispered as she passed, and the sound seemed to grow as others echoed her name.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said cheerfully when she reached the two men. There was a nice police presence, she saw. People were being kept from trampling sacred ground.</p><p>\u201cMiss MacIntyre, welcome back to New York,\u201d a man called. He had a notebook in his hand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it like being back?\u201d someone shouted.</p><p>\u201cIs there a new man in your life?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow are you coping, being so close to Hastings House?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you been back inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thrilled to be back in New York,\u201d she said, leaning toward Laymon\u2019s mike. \u201cI think this is going to be a very important discovery, and...well, New York is my home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you found the body yesterday, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI happened upon the remains, yes. Along with my partner, Brad Verdun. Brad and I are both here under the guidance of Professor David Laymon. We\u2019re all very grateful to the city for inviting us to be part of this extraordinary project\u2014and, of course, to the development company of Tyson, Smith and Tryon. There\u2019s Hank Smith now,\u201d she said, pointing him out. \u201cIt\u2019s thanks to his company that we have this opportunity. And thank you all for your interest, but now, please excuse us. We need to get back to work.\u201d</p> <p>But the reporters weren\u2019t going away. Too bad. She had managed to speak, to be friendly\u2014even to suck up to the developers, she thought wryly. But now she was done. She hurried away, leaving Professor Laymon and Brad to do the talking, but once again it seemed there was nowhere to go to but the trailer, so she strode toward it, hoping it had been left open.</p><p>It had. But once inside, she found herself frustrated once again, since she had none of her research materials with her to study. Then she noticed that someone had left the daily papers lying around, so she picked one up and started to flip through the local section. There was a large article on the dig, which she skimmed. Then she turned the page and found a picture of a very pretty young woman with wide eyes that seemed to defy the world. The caption read: Family Desperate to Find Missing Heiress Genevieve O\u2019Brien.</p><p>She found herself reading the accompanying article with such keen interest that the time slipped away. Genevieve had been a social worker who had resigned her position shortly before her disappearance. She had worked long, hard and diligently for the underprivileged. She had last been seen on a street downtown, entering a dark sedan. Her family was offering a substantial reward for any information that led to her return.</p><p>Without thinking, she shut her eyes and let her fingers roam over the picture.</p><p>\u201cTrying to communicate with the missing now?\u201d a teasing voice asked.</p><p>Startled, her eyes flew open and focused on the door to the trailer. Hank Smith, as neatly and richly attired as ever, was standing there.</p> <p>\u201cA little tired, that\u2019s all,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He shrugged, walking over to the little refrigerator and taking out a bottle of water. \u201cWell, you never know. Our good friend Sergeant Adair may soon be asking for your help. In my opinion, the girl just got sick of her persnickety family and her grungy clients and moved on.\u201d She must not have been looking at him with much approval, because he quickly added, \u201cSorry, I know that sounded cold. But I\u2019ve known a few addicts in my day. You can\u2019t help an addict who doesn\u2019t want to be helped. It\u2019s a waste of time and money, and I hate to waste money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know the feeling,\u201d she said politely, wondering if he was less sanguine than he\u2019d claimed about the consequences of delaying the project. \u201cIs the press spectacle over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey all went back to digging, and it seems they managed to drive the press off through boredom,\u201d Hank said, grinning. \u201cSorry, I know it\u2019s your thing. But to those of us without the patience...it\u2019s pretty damn dull.\u201d He smiled disarmingly to take the sting out of the words.</p><p>She stood, setting the paper aside. \u201cBelieve me, Hank, you\u2019re not the first person to say so.\u201d She grinned. \u201cAnd thanks for the use of the trailer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. And like I said, anytime you want to escape for lunch, you let me know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will\u2014thanks.\u201d</p><p>She left the trailer, eager to get back to work at last.</p> <p>Within a few hours she had to admit that Hank wasn\u2019t the only one who would have found that day\u2019s work incredibly boring. After the discovery of the first grave, Laymon was taking no chances. They weren\u2019t digging. They were dusting\u2014from the surface all the way down. Meanwhile, the remains she had discovered the day before were being painstakingly lifted, surrounding dirt and debris included. She supervised until the precious bones were tenderly crated, and then she went to work with the others, remembering that there were more graves, and more pieces of the past, to find. The process, however, was indeed slow and tedious.</p><p>She noticed, each time she stretched to give her back a break, that Robert Adair was frequently prowling the scene. His interest, however, didn\u2019t exactly seem to be in the dig. She had the feeling that he was walking around the entire block where the dig was taking place and beyond. She wondered what he was up to and made a mental note to tell him that she would have dinner with him the following night.</p><p>At last she felt Brad\u2019s tap on her shoulder. \u201cHave you noticed something?\u201d he whispered teasingly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she found herself whispering back.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s night. Even Laymon\u2019s given up. C\u2019mon. I\u2019ll walk you back to Hastings House.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d She looked up. They were alone in the fenced-in area. \u201cDid Laymon say good-night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Brad said with amusement. \u201cI won\u2019t leave you here alone, Leslie, even if there is a police guard at the gate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. I\u2019m actually in pain from stooping for too long,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He shook his head sadly. \u201cOne of these days you\u2019ll be a hunchback. Such a waste of youth and beauty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you stopped me, thank you,\u201d she said, and laughed, looking down at her clothes as she stood. \u201cI\u2019m filthy. I can\u2019t wait to get home, shower and go to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a wild child you are,\u201d Brad said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going out tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m impressed. Have fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could come with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, but no thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should come with me. What if I wheedled?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cThanks. Brad, but I\u2019m beat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you don\u2019t realize you\u2019ll be happy and awake if you go out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m exhausted. And I promised Robert I\u2019d go out to dinner with him tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood man. Nice father figure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, he wants something from you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but he\u2019s still a good friend.\u201d</p><p>Brad opened his mouth as if he were going to say something, but then he just shook his head. \u201cWhen you want a wild night, you let me know. I can take you to all the coolest bars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you can. And if you pick up any of the wrong girls, I\u2019ll do my best to rescue you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, shucks, thanks, sis.\u201d</p><p>He wrapped an arm around her shoulders, and they trudged carefully from the site, stopping to say good-night to the officer on duty, who gave them a cheerful wave.</p><p>Brad saw her past the gate and up to the door.</p><p>\u201cWant me to check the place out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Leslie assured him. \u201cState-of-the-art alarm, remember? Anyway, some of the employees may still be around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTandy and Jeff...well, they\u2019re all right. But Melissa...\u201d He rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s neurotic, but hey...you have fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Bed will be fun, after the amazing hysteria of a shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right then, baby, you\u2019re on your own. Luv ya\u2014good night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>She was glad to lock Brad out of the house.</p><p>There were always lights on\u2014dim lights inside, brighter lights in the yard\u2014and, of course, warnings about the alarm plastered rather unhistorically along the fence. She felt completely safe, and there was certainly no coming home, even at night, to be met by darkness. In fact, she had a clear view of the entryway and the hall.</p><p>And she was alone.</p><p>There were ghosts here.</p><p>There had to be ghosts here. Soldiers had died here during the Revolution, when the house had been used as a makeshift hospital. An escaping slave, mangled by dogs, had reached Hastings House, only to die moments after reaching safety. A girl, wounded in the riots of 1863, had lain on a couch in the long hallway and breathed her last.</p><p>There were lots of stories, but so far, none of the ghosts had decided to trust her, to make their presence known, to talk to her.</p><p>And certainly not Matt.</p><p>Except in her vividly passionate dreams.</p><p>She whistled softly as she headed for her room. Upstairs, she remembered that she hadn\u2019t eaten, but she didn\u2019t care. She was too tired to bother.</p><p>She warned herself that when she woke up in the middle of the night with her stomach growling, she was going to be sorry, but she ignored the warning. She was totally worn out, and not just from work.</p><p>As if she had been up all night, enjoying wickedly carnal sex...</p><p>She headed for the shower. Maybe after that she would feel revived enough to manage some food.</p><p>Or was she pathetically desperate to go to bed? To dream?</p><p>The water was deliciously hot, and she stood under it for a very long time. Emerging in a state that could only be described as squeaky clean, she crawled into her nightgown, turned on the television and realized ruefully that it was all of eight-thirty. She was going to bed very early. Pathetically early.</p><p>The better to dream, my dear.</p><p>No wonder Brad thought she needed to get a life. And in fact, she agreed with him. Right after this dig.</p><p>Right after she came to terms with this house and Matt\u2019s death.</p><p>She wandered over to the window to look out onto the street.</p><p>Her heart seemed to stutter to a halt.</p><p>He was there again.</p><p>Matt? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No, that was impossible.</p><p>But there was a man standing beneath the streetlight.</p><p>Surely she was imagining him; her eyes must be playing tricks.</p> <p>No. He was there.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t going to lose him this time.</p><p>She pushed away from the window as if she were a swimmer gaining impetus for a lap and went flying across the room, grabbing her robe in passing and flinging it on as she raced down the stairs. She hurried to the door, looking through the peephole as she fumbled with the alarm and the lock.</p><p>Dismay filled her heart. He was gone.</p><p>She threw the door open, ready to race out into the street, anyway.</p> <p>Instead, she slammed against something rock hard. Flesh and blood. A wall of muscle. She looked up.</p><p>Matt!</p><p>No, this man was real. Breathing. Hot. Vital. Alive.</p><p>\u201cMatt?\u201d She couldn\u2019t keep from whispering the name.</p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d the man said.</p><p>Matt\u2019s voice. Matt\u2019s arms reaching out to steady her as she tried to speak. Opened her mouth.</p> <p>Passed out cold.</p><p>6</p><p>S hit.</p><p>The woman was slim, but even \u201cslim\u201d made for considerable dead weight in Joe\u2019s arms. He lifted her, hoping she had disarmed the alarm so that a dozen cops wouldn\u2019t come bearing down on him any second.</p><p>Thankfully, there was lots of light as he carried her into the foyer. He strode straight to the daybed that flanked one wall and set her down on it. Luckily he\u2019d been in the house before, when he\u2019d come himself to examine the scene of the explosion, so he knew his way around. Once he\u2019d set her down, he headed straight for the kitchen and a damp towel. A quick examination of the cupboards produced no sign of anything remotely alcoholic, so he poured a glass of water and hurried back with that and the towel. He knew he stood no chance of finding an ammonia pellet, so he hoped it was just the shock of seeing him that had made her faint, and that she would spring back quickly.</p><p>She did. Her face, beautiful and delicate, scrunched into a frown when the towel touched her forehead.</p><p>She opened her dazzling eyes wide as she stared at him, her sense of alarm returning. She braced her hands on the mattress as she strained away from him, her entire posture wary. \u201cMatt?\u201d she asked hesitantly, disbelievingly.</p><p>\u201cSorry, no,\u201d he said as soothingly as he could. \u201cI\u2019m not Matt, I\u2019m Joe. We never met, but maybe you\u2019ve heard of me? I\u2019m Joe Connolly, Matt\u2019s cousin.\u201d</p> <p>He couldn\u2019t identify the surge of emotion that washed through those glorious eyes as she stared at him. Finally a rueful smile curved her lips; rich, thick lashes fell over her eyes, and she managed a shaky laugh.</p><p>\u201cMy God. I\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m not...I don\u2019t usually run around passing out or...I\u2019m sorry.\u201d She produced a hand, and he took it. She had a firm grip. \u201cI\u2019m Leslie MacIntyre, and of course Matt talked about you all the time. I feel so foolish, but...the family resemblance is...amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d he assured her. \u201cMatt was...cuter,\u201d he offered with a grin. \u201cSeriously, he had lighter hair. My eyes are green, his were blue. But I guess...we were about the same height. Both built like my grandfather...good old Irish brawn, I suppose. I don\u2019t think we were descended from the aristocracy. We were probably potato farmers.\u201d He was talking too much, something he didn\u2019t usually do, but she seemed in need of reassurance, no matter how quickly she appeared to be bouncing back.</p><p>At least she wasn\u2019t pretending not to stare at him.</p><p>She smiled, looking rueful once again. \u201cI really am sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry. I guess I forgot about the family resemblance. Matt and I never saw it much, anyway.\u201d He stared back at her and grew serious. \u201cA mutual friend, Robert Adair, told me you were staying here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he? He might have warned me about you,\u201d she said with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s known me forever, knew Matt forever...he probably doesn\u2019t really see the resemblance anymore.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cWell, it\u2019s really great to meet you. At last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went by the hospital,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cYou weren\u2019t conscious at the time.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, looking away at last. \u201cI got your note. Honestly, I\u2019m so embarrassed. I\u2019m not really dressed, I\u2019ve passed out on you...I assure you, Matt intended to marry an intelligent human being. I mean, that\u2019s what I usually am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo assurance needed,\u201d he said. \u201cI shocked you. I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d</p><p>They were very close, he suddenly realized, she half prone, he by her side. He must have been making her uncomfortable. He rose. \u201cI just came by to say hello, but I see you\u2019re ready to go to bed.\u201d It was just past eight-thirty, he realized. Well, she worked hard. Digging all day must be exhausting. Anyway, lots of people went to bed early. Eight-thirty? \u201cI\u2019ll get out of your hair. Though I would love to see you again, if you have time.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI\u2019d make time for Matt\u2019s cousin, Joe,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>God, her smile was pure enchantment. He knew why Matt had been so in love.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d he returned.</p><p>She was staring up at him again. \u201cHave you been in Hastings House before?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He shrugged. Why pussyfoot around? \u201cI\u2019m a private investigator. I had to come. I had to investigate the explosion for myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt appeared to have been an accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAppeared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe police investigated, the fire department investigated...a gas line exploded when someone turned up the heat.\u201d</p><p>The words hung between them. He wondered if she was thinking the same thing he was. Accident? Or had the line been rigged, and had someone known and decided to turn up the heat at just the right time?</p><p>\u201cGreta was the hostess that night,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He lifted his shoulders. \u201cI think Greta would lie across the railroad tracks before she\u2019d destroy a place of historic value.\u201d</p><p>Leslie lowered her head; Joe could tell that she agreed with him. He had learned over the years that the answers to many things could be surprising, but that was one headline he just didn\u2019t see. Wealthy Socialite Runs Amok, Destroys Historic House.</p><p>But someone else...? That he could see.</p><p>Leslie looked up at him and flushed. She wondered if their thoughts had been running along the same route. She stood suddenly. \u201cActually, it\u2019s ridiculously early. Want to give me a minute? I neglected to have dinner this evening, and I\u2019m suddenly starving. Oh, sorry, you probably have plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to take you to dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t suggesting...and I really wouldn\u2019t want you to change any plans on my behalf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to take you to dinner,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>She arched a brow, studying him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Then...make yourself at home. Except,\u201d she added with a laugh, \u201cwatch out for the tourist no-no tapes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dream of sitting on an antique chair,\u201d he assured her. \u201cI\u2019ll be in the kitchen, how\u2019s that? Fairly safe, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. I\u2019ll be right down.\u201d</p><p>He watched her race up the stairs.</p><p>Matt had been a lucky man. Then again, Matt had deserved the best.</p><p>He wandered into the kitchen and helped himself to a glass of water. There was a plain wooden chair by the hearth. There was no fire burning, but he sat and stared into the darkened recess of the alcove anyway.</p><p>He smiled suddenly, glad that he had stopped by. Eileen Brideswell wouldn\u2019t be pleased, but he couldn\u2019t work every minute of every day, and he had thought of little but her missing niece since he had taken on the case. In fact, she had grown in his mind. He felt almost as if he knew her. He knew the idealism that had driven her, knew the passion with which she had worked.</p><p>He prayed that she wasn\u2019t dead. That she had, perhaps subconsciously, wanted to inflict some punishment on her aunt, the remaining bastion of a difficult family, so she had run off on impulse to take a breather up in Canada or down in Mexico.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t believe it. She hadn\u2019t used a single credit card. She hadn\u2019t written a check. No one had made either legal or illegal use of her social security number. The last person to have seen her\u2014before she stepped into a dark sedan\u2014was Didi Dancer, who had clearly liked her and seemed to have no reason to lie about what she\u2019d seen.</p><p>He leaned back in the chair, shaking his head and turning his thoughts to tonight. He was glad to have met Leslie at last. She had taken his mind off his task and given him a much-needed break. But she came with baggage, too. Sorrow that they shared.</p><p>He needed a vacation, he decided. Tahiti was starting to sound awfully good.</p><p>He rose, walking into the servants\u2019 pantry, where the explosion had occurred.</p><p>He looked around at the repaired walls, the fresh paint, the furniture. He was no expert. He couldn\u2019t tell the difference between real period furniture and good reproductions. It was interesting, though, that the explosion had taken place here and the rest of the house had suffered very little damage.</p><p>Targeted.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t get that thought out of his mind.</p><p>He knew that Matt had been working on several things when he died. Because of Leslie, he had written about restoration efforts in the downtown area. His other focus at the time had been the prostitutes who were disappearing.</p><p>Had Matt been targeted because he was such a good investigative reporter? Because he had come too close to the truth? And yet, was the disappearance of the down-and-out really such an important issue that someone would kill because of it?</p><p>Sure. The abductor and presumed murderer. But how would he have managed access to Hastings House? And most people wouldn\u2019t know how to rig a gas explosion to look so convincingly like an accident.</p><p>Joe felt a strange draft. Enough to make him rub his arms to ward off the chill. \u201cMatt,\u201d he said aloud, \u201cI just don\u2019t like it. I swear, I will find out the truth.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was talking to the air, he told himself in disgust.</p><p>And yet, he felt more determined than ever. There was no logical reason for it, but he didn\u2019t give a damn what the experts had said. Something about the accident scenario wasn\u2019t right.</p><p>\u201cYou were too good a man,\u201d he said softly. \u201cSomeone had to be after you.\u201d</p> <p>There was no whisper of approval. Nothing.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>He turned quickly. People didn\u2019t come up on him by surprise often. He must have been very deep in thought.</p><p>Or too busy talking to himself.</p><p>\u201cI had a feeling I might find you here,\u201d she said.</p> <p>He lifted a hand. \u201cSorry\u2014talking to myself. I didn\u2019t hear you coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was watching your face. You don\u2019t believe it was an accident.\u201d</p><p>It was a statement, not a question.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I have to find a reason,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019ve thought the same thing. Anyway, shall we go?\u201d she asked.</p><p>She was wearing perfume. An elusive, soft scent. Her hair was long and swinging free, shimmering in the light. She was a bit too thin, but even thin, she had a nice shape. Smiling at him from the doorway, she was a vision. He felt a stirring and quickly tamped it down. Matt\u2019s girl. He had to be a friend, nothing more.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you in the mood for?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cItalian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good to me. I know a great place in Little Italy, and my car is just around the corner. I was down here...looking around before I decided to stop by.\u201d</p><p>Her smile faded for a moment. \u201cYou\u2019re going to dig until you find the truth, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d he replied, \u201cI\u2019ve been hired to search for a missing girl right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe disappeared down here.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cOne of the prostitutes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. Come on. I\u2019ll tell you about it over dinner.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you. You\u2019re going to dig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re the one who digs for a living,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI looked into the explosion. I grilled every friend, acquaintance and total stranger who was here or knew someone here. Well, except for you,\u201d he added with a rueful grin. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to prove anything. The only answer anyone came up with was the combination of the gas line and happenstance.\u201d</p><p>She turned and started out, then hesitated and looked back, smiling. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you\u2019re going to stop looking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, for the sake of argument, let\u2019s say I\u2019m not. But I\u2019m Matt\u2019s cousin, so I can\u2019t help but think...well, I can\u2019t stop. Can\u2019t accept the obvious explanation. Because of him. That doesn\u2019t mean I know anything. Now come on. They do a great francese at this place. Veal or chicken\u2014take your pick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChicken. Can\u2019t help it, I avoid veal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me you\u2019re not a vegetarian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot unless chicken has become a vegetable.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. He\u2019d sure as hell walked right into that one. Strangely, it wasn\u2019t at all awkward being with her. He liked her. He could see why Matt had loved her. But he had to remember that Matt had been engaged to her and tread carefully.</p><p>Joe. Good old Joe. The world\u2019s best cousin, practically a brother. He\u2019d tried so hard to touch him. He had to let Joe know that it was okay.</p><p>Except that it wasn\u2019t okay. And he knew why, now that Joe had put it into words. It hadn\u2019t been a freak accident. He\u2019d been murdered.</p><p>Why? Who would have killed so many so callously, just to get to him?</p><p>Joe would figure it out. Good old Joe.</p><p>Good old flesh-and-blood Joe.</p><p>And Leslie.</p><p>Leslie, who had thought Joe was him. Did they really look that much alike? Or, rather, had they once resembled each other so much? Maybe. Those closest seldom saw it.</p><p>Joe...and Leslie.</p><p>They were just going to dinner. And Joe was a good guy. Not slimy. So...He had to let her go. Not that dinner meant that anything was going on, at least not right away.</p><p>Besides, maybe they needed time together to discover the truth that had eluded them all.</p><p>The living and the dead.</p><p>They managed to secure an outside table. The street was closed to traffic, and the weather was unbelievably balmy, a promise that summer was coming. Joe had known Rudolfo, the owner and host, for years, and he was complimentary to Leslie without being smarmy. They had a bottle of his best Chianti and an antipasto of cheeses, meats and marinated vegetables almost immediately, and Leslie proved that she was definitely hungry. They both ordered the chicken francese, and then she sat back, her head cocked at an angle, and smiled.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me about your case. Is it the girl whose picture was in the paper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Genevieve O\u2019Brien.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat she\u2019s alive?\u201d he finished. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I certainly don\u2019t believe she just took off without telling anyone. First things first\u2014the police had done their homework. I went over it, and there\u2019s absolutely no sign of her turning up anywhere else.\u201d</p><p>Leslie considered that fact. \u201cShe\u2019s rich, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of her funds have been touched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScary,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd sad,\u201d she murmured, lifting her wineglass and taking a sip. \u201cI\u2019m sure lots of people disappear and never show up again. I mean, think of the places people can dispose of bodies. Swamps, deserts...oceans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is New York City,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cRivers, landfills, a city beneath the city.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, realizing that he hadn\u2019t really thought about that last possibility. He leaned back, staring at her. \u201cBrilliant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not,\u201d she said. \u201cI just happen to know that...well, there\u2019s a city beneath the city. In a lot of neighborhoods, the way that the streets have been built up, you can be in a basement looking out at what once was street level. And then there are old foundations, old tunnels...all kinds of unknown underground places. Plus, even though the city\u2019s mainly built on granite bedrock, loose earth shifts. I learned that looking for graves. In fact, in many old graveyards, the coffins have shifted until there\u2019s actually nothing\u2014or at least not the right something\u2014beneath the headstones, and you\u2019re walking on graves no matter where you go. Over time, when the earth is soft, when there\u2019s rain, construction, vibrations from the subways...well, things shift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCreepy,\u201d he said.</p><p>She smiled, shaking her head. \u201cNot if you\u2019re in my line of work.\u201d</p><p>Their food came. They chatted about the neighborhood for a while, about how so much of Little Italy was being absorbed by Chinatown, but that was New York for you, always changing. New groups of people came in on a daily basis. Some people liked it, some people continued to hate foreigners, even though they themselves had been the foreigners of a previous decade or century.</p><p>\u201cThis is a land of promise, but sometimes that scares people, so they ignore what bothers them, whatever messes up their pretty picture,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the problems with the missing prostitutes. Getting people to care. A lot of the people have a tendency to think that women like that deserve what they get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack the Ripper went after prostitutes, and it was one of the biggest scandals in Victorian London,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>\u201cBecause people were horrified by the gruesome brutality of the crimes. Here, people are just disappearing. No bodies, no horrifying details in the tabloids. And these days we\u2019re far more accustomed to serial killers\u2014and so far, no one\u2019s even proved that we have one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think that Genevieve O\u2019Brien\u2019s disappearance is connected to the missing prostitutes?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThe last person I\u2019ve found who\u2019ll admit to seeing her is a prostitute. She was trying to help a lot of the working girls. Actually, I\u2019m surprised Robert hasn\u2019t asked for your help yet. According to him, you have a gift for finding...people.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, setting down her fork. \u201cRobert told you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI read it. This evening\u2019s paper has an article about you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You\u2019re credited with waltzing in and immediately making an important discovery at the dig. The reporter brought out the fact that you\u2019d homed right in on a missing homeless man a couple of years ago.\u201d</p><p>She looked upset. \u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, do you have a special gift?\u201d he asked teasingly.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t amused. In fact, she seemed to be even more irritated. \u201cLogic,\u201d she said briefly. \u201cI was told the man\u2019s habits and something about his past. He was found in an old subway tunnel. Simple deduction.\u201d</p><p>She had suddenly grown almost hostile, but he asked his next question, anyway. \u201cBut even before that...you were known for having an instinct for finding graves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA feel for history. Did you want coffee?\u201d</p><p>The question was abrupt. He was intrigued, but he followed her lead and changed the subject. When Rudolfo came to ask how their dinner had been, Joe had a question for his old friend, too. \u201cRudolfo, could you use another waitress?\u201d</p><p>Rudolfo looked back at him skeptically, then groaned.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, yes, I could use a waitress. A good one. A good girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I send someone around to see you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSend her next week. Monday. If I like her, she\u2019s hired. She\u2019s got to be a good girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will be, or I swear...I\u2019ll wash dishes for a week.\u201d</p><p>Rudolfo sniffed. \u201cI have a very good dishwasher. The mechanical kind.\u201d</p><p>Joe grinned. \u201cOkay, so I\u2019ll bus tables and man the steaming monster, how\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Rudolfo pointed a finger at him. \u201cYou will work for me. Like a green immigrant. I\u2019ll work you hard.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a deal.\u201d</p><p>Rudolfo sniffed and left them.</p><p>Leslie stared at Joe, smiling again. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get a prostitute to work here, aren\u2019t you? Do you do that often?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI believe in this woman,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>She touched his hand where it lay on the table. \u201cWe can try, but we can\u2019t always change the world, you know.\u201d</p><p>He felt a stirring, which he firmly banished. \u201cLet\u2019s just say I\u2019m doing this one for Genevieve,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She nodded, a small smile curving her lips. Her brilliant gaze met his. She did understand.</p><p>Lord, it would be easy to fall in love with this woman.</p> <p>As Matt had.</p><p>Back at Hastings House, he walked her to the door. He was surprised when she walked in and left the door open, letting him follow. In the foyer, she turned to look at him. \u201cI find it very hard to accept that what happened was an accident.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cMatt was writing about the missing prostitutes, you know. Trying to arouse public awareness and sympathy. I\u2019d really love to know more about the gas lines and how the explosion might have been rigged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s impossible to discover anything now,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he repeated, grimacing as he stared at her.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLeslie, haven\u2019t you noticed? Everything in the house has been redone to work with electricity. There are no more gas lines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said, flushing. \u201cI hadn\u2019t noticed.\u201d</p><p>He frowned suddenly. \u201cLeslie, don\u2019t go sharing your suspicions with everyone, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t, not exactly, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. Just don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re suspicious, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd investigating is what I do for a living.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I can help.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have...instincts, sometimes. Look, I just don\u2019t like to be laughed at, and I hate it when people call me the psychic. I\u2019m not psychic. But I know...things, sometimes. Please, will you let me help? Even with your missing girl?\u201d</p><p>He felt his heart pounding.</p><p>If it means spending time with you, you bet. Oh, you bet.</p><p>No, she was Matt\u2019s fianc\u00e9e.</p><p>But Matt was...</p><p>Dead.</p><p>\u201cSure, we\u2019ll talk,\u201d he said. He extended his hand to shake hers good-night. All she needed was Matt\u2019s trusted cousin turning into a lech.</p><p>But damn, he was only flesh and blood.</p><p>Stop.</p><p>Forgive me, Matt. God help me, I\u2019ll keep my thoughts to myself.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk,\u201d he repeated. \u201cBut if you want to help me, you have to promise you\u2019ll be careful about what you say\u2014and what you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCross my heart,\u201d she swore with an enchanting smile.</p><p>\u201cAll right, then. Now,\u201d he said, glancing at his watch\u2014almost eleven. \u201cI\u2019m getting out of here. You can still get a good night\u2019s sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Thanks. How do I reach you?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a card. \u201cCall me anytime.\u201d</p><p>She smiled.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople seem to think I\u2019m like a hothouse flower. I get that all the time, mostly because people are worried and want to take care of me. But...well, I will call you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, then. Lock up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSet the alarm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. It\u2019s state-of-the-art.\u201d</p><p>He forced himself not to look back as he exited the house.</p><p>Upstairs, television on, back in her nightgown, Leslie walked to the window, almost expecting to see a man leaning against the lamppost.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>She smiled. She felt better for having met Joe, though she still couldn\u2019t believe he had startled her so badly that she had passed out. But for a minute...just for a minute...she had thought Matt was back. In the flesh.</p><p>No, Matt was only in her dreams.</p><p>Was Joe right, though? That the explosion hadn\u2019t been an accident? The idea had certainly occurred to her time and time again that Matt had been targeted.</p><p>And what about Genevieve O\u2019Brien? Could she possibly help Joe find her?</p><p>She was excited at the thought, though also a bit chastened by the thought that the only people she\u2019d found to date had been dead.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she commanded herself. \u201cGet back to reality here. You still have work to do at the dig.\u201d</p><p>And she did. She was going to find Mary\u2019s grave, then see to it that mother and child were reburied together.</p><p>With that thought uppermost in her mind, she climbed into bed to watch the news. She saw her own face on the screen and watched in morbid fascination as a reporter came on to talk about her apparent ability to find bodies, an ability, the reporter claimed, that predated the death of her fianc\u00e9 and her own terrible ordeal following the explosion at Hastings House.</p><p>Luckily, nothing was said about her living there now. People were still keeping mum on that subject.</p><p>As soon as the report was over, she found a station that was showing repeats of Gilligan\u2019s Island and watched the adventures of the seven castaways until she felt herself drifting off at last.</p><p>She turned off the television, then lay awake wondering whether Matt would come to her in her dreams again.</p><p>She kept opening her eyes, looking into the shadows, willing him to appear.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>At last she drifted to sleep.</p><p>And then he came.</p><p>Once again, she knew she was asleep, that she was dreaming. But it didn\u2019t matter, because he was there. Long and hard and lean, as vital as he had been in life. He touched her, stroked her. She felt his fingers on her naked flesh, followed by the brush of his lips, as real as his kisses had ever been.</p><p>A caress down her spine...</p><p>Liquid fire on her breasts...</p><p>Pressure, thrusting, enfolding arms...</p><p>He whispered, \u201cI love you so much, Leslie.... Oh, God, Leslie...\u201d</p><p>She wanted the soaring, the hunger, the yearning...the passion, the tenderness and the volatility...to go on forever.</p><p>She was filled with the sweetest ache at the sheer intimacy that raged between them, at his natural physical grace. Together they strained, rocked, writhed together. She reveled in the hardness of his body, the shudder of his desire, the sudden explosion of his climax....</p><p>And basked in his arms, eternally around her.</p><p>His breath was soft against her ear as he sighed in complete sexual satisfaction. She could still feel his body, molded to hers.</p><p>She moved in his arms, as she had done so many times before. When they\u2019d lived together they had often kept different hours. He would come in once she was asleep, and slowly, seductively, awaken her by making love to her.</p><p>And they would sometimes whisper about their days afterward, lying replete in each other\u2019s arms, so it seemed the most natural thing in the world to talk to him now, even knowing it was only in her dreams.</p><p>\u201cI met Joe today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoe, huh? Good guy. Sad history, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was madly in love with his high-school sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe died. Cancer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s ever given up the ghost.\u201d</p><p>The ghost.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an interesting guy,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHe is. He\u2019s great. Listen to him.\u201d</p><p>He nuzzled her neck, holding her more tightly.</p><p>\u201cI thought he was you for a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? I guess we did look alike.\u201d</p><p>Then his lips found hers, and it started all over again.</p><p>It was her turn to whisper to him. \u201cMatt, I love you so much. And I miss you so much, need you so much....\u201d</p><p>He drew back slightly, looking down at her. \u201cYou can\u2019t let yourself need me, Leslie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he whispered, and then his touch took over. \u201cForgive me, but I just need a little more time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime?\u201d she repeated.</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply. Not with words.</p><p>She awoke, the dream still so real in her mind, and found herself naked, her bed a rumpled disaster.</p><p>She swore softly, deeply embarrassed, even though she was alone.</p><p>She closed her eyes, shook her head, then opened her eyes and looked across the room. A soft gasp escaped her.</p><p>Matt was there.</p><p>Sitting in the wing chair by the fireplace.</p><p>\u201cHere I am...but it\u2019s wrong. I shouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Leslie murmured, so stunned that she could barely form the word.</p><p>\u201cSorry. Never mind. He\u2019s right, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t an accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt, talk to me, tell me what you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know anything. That\u2019s the problem.\u201d</p><p>She started to rise, tripped on the sheet, and by the time she untangled herself and looked toward the chair, he was gone as if he had never been.</p><p>As if their conversation had been nothing more than part of a desperate and wistful dream.</p><p>7</p><p>T here was dust everywhere; Joe wasn\u2019t at all certain that he could have ascertained anything in the gray and vile-smelling room he entered. But he was pleased to be here, doubly pleased because Leslie had called him with such excitement and insisted that he come.</p><p>The police presence around the dig was larger than ever, and the press swell had grown to monstrous proportions. But Robert Adair had cut his way through the crowd to reach him, then created a path for the two of them to reach the site and climb down into the strange gaping hole. Despite the work lights, he had been totally disoriented when he\u2019d first entered the underground room. It wasn\u2019t exactly the smell of death that had assailed his nostrils when he\u2019d first managed to straighten up in the subterranean room, but more like something stale, the overwhelming odor of simple decay that had been closed up for too long. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere you are!\u201d</p><p>He was startled when Leslie rushed over and hugged him. She was barely recognizable, she was so covered in the dust of the past, but her eyes were bright in her smudged face. \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou found a room,\u201d he said, feeling foolish for stating the obvious.</p> <p>She laughed. He saw that Professor Laymon, Brad Verdun and a number of other workers were clustered at the far side of the room. They clearly understood the significance of the find far more that he did. They were talking excitedly and dusting at a wall.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a crypt,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cA crypt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a church here at one time, built in 1817, to be exact,\u201d she told him. \u201cA few years later, it burned to the ground in the fire that destroyed much of old New York. Other buildings went up on the site and were razed over the next century, and then, in the late 1930s, what we\u2019d now call a miniskyscraper went up. That\u2019s what was just torn down. But this is it, the proof that we\u2019ve made an amazing find. Look! This is where the priests and the wealthy were buried, not mixed with the poorer people buried in the churchyard. We\u2019ve already found gold crucifixes and other High Episcopalian paraphernalia, and even a storeroom of old books and documents. Isn\u2019t it great?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cAmazing,\u201d he told her. \u201cAnd your...\u201d He found himself lowering his voice. \u201cYour instinct led you to it?\u201d</p> <p>She started laughing again, delighted, elated. \u201cNo, I leaned against what I thought was an embankment, and I fell through.\u201d</p><p>He had to appreciate the rueful humor in her eyes.</p><p>Professor Laymon let out an excited cry. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it! It\u2019s a cache of sermons. There\u2019s a protected niche here...watch the bones,\u201d he warned, as eager workers surged forward.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d Joe said. \u201cAnd thanks for getting me in here.\u201d</p><p>She was holding his hands, he realized, as if they were old friends. But then again, they did have a bond.</p><p>They had both loved Matt.</p> <p>She pulled him closer, rising slightly on her toes to whisper, \u201cYou had to see what I was talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe city under the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d he said softly, \u201cyou think that there might be a psycho kidnapping and killing prostitutes and then hiding the bodies in hidden crypts?\u201d He didn\u2019t mean to sound as skeptical as he did, but she merely stared at him, amused.</p><p>\u201cMaybe not crypts, but somewhere in the abandoned places under New York. Do you have any better answers?\u201d she inquired.</p><p>\u201cNo. So let\u2019s start exploring underground.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, smiling. \u201cI\u2019m just about done here, anyway. So how was your day?\u201d</p><p>He started to answer, and then decided not to bother. He\u2019d spent the day retracing his steps. He\u2019d gone back to Genevieve\u2019s apartment. He\u2019d studied every little scrap of paper she\u2019d left lying around, every note. He\u2019d checked out her last doctor\u2019s appointment and her last dentist appointment. He\u2019d visited the bars where she\u2019d partied with friends, and all he\u2019d found anywhere were people who spoke of her wistfully and with affection. He\u2019d checked again for any evidence of her credit cards being used. Then he\u2019d headed back to the street where Didi continued to ply her trade. She hadn\u2019t remembered anything else, and none of the other prostitutes she\u2019d introduced him to had anything helpful to add, either, though they had all spoken admiringly of Genevieve. In the end, it still seemed he had hit his best stroke of luck when he first met Didi\u2014the last time anyone had seen Genevieve O\u2019Brien had been when she had gotten into the dark sedan.</p> <p>The highlight of the day, of course, had been telling Didi about the waitressing job he had arranged.</p><p>\u201cYour friend would hire me?\u201d she asked skeptically.</p><p>\u201cYes. Cut the makeup by half, wear something that covers you...you know the drill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re taking a risk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife is a risk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI owe you. I\u2019ll be there. And I won\u2019t let you down. Except now I won\u2019t have Genevieve to help me get my daughter back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStart with legitimate employment, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d She\u2019d hugged him.</p><p>The low point of the day had been talking to Eileen Brideswell and telling her that, so far, he\u2019d traced Genevieve to a street corner and a dark sedan, and no further.</p><p>\u201cLeslie,\u201d Brad Verdun called excitedly. \u201cCome look at these.\u201d</p><p>She turned at the sound of her name and was looking at him when he first noticed Joe. For a minute he went dead still. Maybe it was the light, but he seemed to turn parchment white. His lips formed a single word. Matt.</p><p>\u201cSorry, no. Joe Connolly, Matt\u2019s cousin,\u201d Joe said, walking carefully across the uneven floor and offering his hand.</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d Verdun stared at him, openmouthed.</p><p>Laymon turned around then and gasped.</p><p>\u201cJoseph Connolly,\u201d Joe repeated. \u201cMatt\u2019s cousin.\u201d Did they all believe in ghosts? Hell, these people spent their lives working with the past and the dead.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a dead ringer for him,\u201d Brad said, then winced. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. Leslie asked me down here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d Brad said. \u201cShe just never mentioned you, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Joe didn\u2019t reply. No need to say that they had just met.</p><p>Leslie came up behind him then. \u201cI\u2019m going to take off, let you guys deal with all this,\u201d she said.</p><p>Brad frowned. \u201cLeslie, you must realize the significance\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and we\u2019ll be working in here for weeks,\u201d she said cheerfully. \u201cAnd for the love of God, Brad, you deal with the reporters, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d she said to Joe, taking his arm.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d he said, letting her drag him away. The other men just stared. Neither one replied.</p><p>Joe climbed out of the hole first, then reached back to help her. They were both covered in grime, but as he helped her out, he was surprised by the sound of applause coming from the street.</p><p>Beneath the dirt on her face, he saw her blanch. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. We\u2019ll get away,\u201d he said.</p><p>When she was standing, he turned to see Ken Dryer, whom he knew from his own days on the force, coming toward them.</p><p>Despite the dirt everywhere, Dryer still managed to look impeccable in his dress uniform. He was the perfect spokesman\u2014tall, dark and handsome, with a voice that would have done the old crooners proud. \u201cLeslie, the reporters are all clamoring to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fell into a hole. You tell them about it,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI can, but\u2014\u201d He broke off, staring at Joe. \u201cHey, Joe. What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeslie called me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two\u2014oh, yeah...the Matt connection,\u201d he said.</p><p>Joe shrugged. \u201cRight, the Matt connection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKen, please help me get out of here today.\u201d</p><p>Ken stared at her, then shrugged and smiled. \u201cI guess the rest of us are exhibitionists, huh? Brad and the professor love to talk. Even Hank has been giving them an earful, though his heart must be sinking. I\u2019d say you\u2019re looking at a good year here, holding up the building process. Oh, well, they\u2019re going for public appeal, and this time, they\u2019ll be paying a price. Head for the trailer. I\u2019ll send an officer to lead you out the back gate in the fence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Ken,\u201d she said, then took Joe\u2019s arm. \u201cThis way,\u201d she told him.</p><p>They headed for the trailer. He could hear the protest of the crowd, but then Dryer\u2019s smooth tones rose above it, followed a moment later by laughter.</p><p>They reached the trailer in safety. \u201cWant water? A soda?\u201d she asked him as soon as they were inside.</p><p>\u201cWater would be great.\u201d</p><p>She had barely supplied him with a plastic bottle before the door opened. In Joe\u2019s opinion, the man who entered could only be described as oily. \u201cHey, Leslie. I heard you needed some help escaping,\u201d he said.</p><p>Joe wasn\u2019t sure why, but he hated the guy the minute he heard those simple words. The man was talking as if it were his job to protect Leslie. His voice had a proprietorial tone, and he just didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>When the guy noticed him\u2014how it had taken him so long, Joe didn\u2019t know, since he was a good six-three\u2014he went dead still, gaping. Joe found himself enjoying it.</p><p>\u201cJoseph Connolly,\u201d he said, offering a hand.</p><p>For a second the fellow looked horrified, as if he were about to collapse. \u201cHello, sorry...I...uh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t see a ghost. I\u2019m Matt\u2019s cousin, and I\u2019m just starting to realize how much he and I resembled each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot.\u201d Hank looked at Leslie. In fact, he looked as if he\u2019d like to come between the two of them.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think of the new discovery?\u201d Joe asked politely.</p><p>\u201cIncredible. Seems Leslie\u2019s luck is still holding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust lack of coordination, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d she said. \u201cI fell through a wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis will hold up building for a long time,\u201d Joe said easily. \u201cHow is the company going to deal with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to go with the flow, celebrate history,\u201d Hank said. He grinned, and it seemed like an honest grin. \u201cEvery time those cameras roll, they\u2019re picking up the company logo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill, you must be talking millions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd millions. Doesn\u2019t matter. Have you ever tried to buy an ad during the Superbowl?\u201d Hank asked.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood press is expensive.\u201d Hank touched Leslie\u2019s cheek. A little too familiarly, Joe thought, then told himself to shut up. What right did he have, after all? \u201cWhen you can\u2019t beat trouble, you just have to deal,\u201d he said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Leslie moved slightly away from him, and Joe could have sworn that her smile was false. \u201cHopefully, we\u2019re doing the city a favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd our stockholders, too,\u201d Hank said.</p><p>The trailer door opened. \u201cPolice escort,\u201d a voice said cheerfully. A known voice.</p> <p>\u201cRobert!\u201d Leslie said with pleasure.</p><p>Robert Adair came up the steps. Leslie gave him a hug, then apologized quickly. \u201cI\u2019ve just smudged you big time,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI can live with being smudged by you anytime,\u201d Robert said. \u201cHey there, Joe. So you two have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmudged each other already,\u201d Joe interrupted quickly. He didn\u2019t want Hank Smith knowing they had just met, though he wasn\u2019t sure why. Let them all think that he and Leslie had a past history as friends. He could protect her better that way.</p><p>Protect her? From what? Where had that thought come from? What implication had there ever been that Leslie might be in danger?</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s get going. There\u2019s a gate in the fence in the back where I can get you out,\u201d Robert told them.</p><p>They followed him, and a few minutes later they emerged on the far side of the site. \u201cYou both need baths, you know. Otherwise, people will be stopping you in the street and offering you money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d Leslie said. She laughed. \u201cI\u2019ve seen much worse on the streets of New York.\u201d</p><p>Robert studied her and rolled his eyes. \u201cOkay, you\u2019ve got a point. But you sure do look like you just climbed out of a hole in the mud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, bath,\u201d Leslie agreed.</p><p>\u201cThen dinner,\u201d Robert said.</p> <p>\u201cDinner?\u201d Joe cut in.</p><p>\u201cLeslie promised to have dinner with me tonight. Want to come along? You can tell me where you\u2019re getting looking for the O\u2019Brien girl.\u201d</p><p>Joe shrugged and looked at Leslie. \u201cDeal?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cDeal,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>She arrived home in time to see Hastings House in action. Melissa was handling tickets. Her smile was radiant when she saw Leslie. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, yourself. How\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. There are two tours going on now. Just wave to the guides on your way up to your room. Oh, and lock your door. We keep an eye on the tourists, but you never know when someone will go wandering off. By the way...you\u2019re really, uh, dirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Thanks,\u201d Leslie told her.</p> <p>Jeff was with a group in the hall, explaining Colonial construction. He got wide-eyed when he saw her, so of course the ten or so people in his group stared at her, too. Jeff just gave her a nod and said, \u201cOne of our archaeologists, always busy at work.\u201d</p><p>She was grimy enough that she hoped she wouldn\u2019t be recognized from any recent articles or newscasts, and she gave a quick wave before hurrying up the stairs. She passed the second tour group in the upper hallway, where they were hearing about the house\u2019s history as part of the Underground Railroad.</p><p>She paused for a minute. She\u2019d been aware of the history of the house for a very long time, but being reminded that it had been part of the Underground Railroad suddenly seemed to be important.</p><p>Why?</p><p>She realized she was just standing there, filthy. She hurried to her bedroom\u2014locking the door behind her, as Melissa had warned. Then she leaned against it for a moment, staring at the rocker by the hearth. But it was empty.</p><p>Had he really been there this morning? Was he haunting Hastings House? Or had she just wished him there, just as she had wished him into her dreams? And had his comments come to her mind because she had actually been talking to the flesh-and-blood Joe, a man who believed that there had been foul play at the house?</p><p>\u201cMatt?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>But there was no answer. She showered and dressed, whimsically opting for a black velvet sheath that fit the changing weather. By the time she left her room the tours were over and the guides were gone.</p><p>Melissa was still there, though, in the small upstairs office, counting receipts and balancing her books. She whistled when Leslie walked by. \u201cThat\u2019s a knockout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOff to a black-tie event?\u201d Melissa asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. Dinner with friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard about the crypt you discovered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFell into.\u201d</p><p>Melissa sighed dreamily. \u201cThink I could really volunteer to work with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet. I\u2019ll see to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you so much.\u201d Melissa frowned even as she spoke.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I\u2019ve lost a twenty, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s got to be there somewhere,\u201d Leslie said.</p><p>\u201cYes, but...oh, it\u2019s right here. I swear it wasn\u2019t here a minute ago,\u201d Melissa said, still frowning.</p><p>\u201cMaybe something was on top of it.\u201d</p><p>Melissa grinned at her. \u201cAnd maybe the ghosts are helping me out. You think?\u201d she asked wistfully.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>The sound of knocking came from downstairs. \u201cGood night, Melissa, I\u2019ll see you in the morning,\u201d Leslie told her.</p><p>\u201cRight. Have a good time. Knock \u2019em dead.\u201d She blushed. \u201cI mean, you look like a million.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Joe was at the door. She forced herself to smile as she greeted him. He wasn\u2019t Matt; she knew that. They were different people, different personalities. But tonight, he reminded her so much of Matt as he\u2019d looked last night....</p><p>They even used the same aftershave.</p><p>But he looked good, dark blond hair newly washed, still damp, hard-cut rugged features, casual suede jacket. Tall and well muscled. His shoulders were a little broader than Matt\u2019s; maybe Matt had been a half inch taller.</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right?\u201d he asked, frowning.</p><p>\u201cOf course. Where\u2019s Robert?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re meeting him just down the street. Tonight, a good old American steakhouse.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>When they reached the sidewalk, she found herself looking back. There sat the house\u2014a picture-perfect Colonial. Around it, present-day Manhattan. Alive, wild, a little bit wicked, and still a place where people were just born, lived and died. The past and the present, interlocking. Countless stories above the ground. Countless stories below it. She closed her eyes. Not far away, the World Trade Towers had stood. So much tragedy. So much destruction. A certain sadness still permeated downtown, despite the fact that so much was up and running again. Somehow, centuries-old churches only blocks away had remained standing. History remembered, history lost.</p><p>It was an amazing city, and it was equally amazing the way the house stood where it did, with the modern world all around it. Every decade made a change, she reminded herself.</p><p>The house, she thought, was somehow a key to murder.</p><p>Matt\u2019s murder.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she said quickly, forcing a smile. But it was something. Worlds colliding. Stories above the earth, stories below.</p><p>He tried to follow. Couldn\u2019t.</p><p>But just this morning, she had seen him. It hadn\u2019t lasted long, but she had seen him. Even so...</p><p>He had to let go.</p><p>No, he couldn\u2019t say goodbye. Not yet, not when he\u2019d just learned to say hello. And now, because of Leslie, Joe was coming to the house. Joe had a sense that something wrong had happened there, and he was convinced that the truth needed to be told. Then...</p><p>He loved her, really loved her, and she deserved a long life and happiness, so then he would say goodbye.</p><p>\u201cSo...your mysterious sixth sense has struck again,\u201d Robert said, idly rubbing his thumb and forefinger over the beginning stubble of a gray beard.</p><p>\u201cIt had nothing to do with any sixth sense. I fell. Honest to God, I fell,\u201d Leslie said.</p><p>Robert shrugged disbelievingly. \u201cDo you know how long Howard Carter looked for King Tut\u2019s tomb without finding it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRobert,\u201d she protested, \u201cit was pure dumb luck. And it\u2019s not even a total shock. City records indicated that the church had been there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just get to it?\u201d Joe asked Robert, amused. He sipped his beer, watching Leslie. They\u2019d already ordered: steaks, potatoes and salads all around. Even Leslie had opted for a beer.</p><p>\u201cGet to it?\u201d Robert asked blandly.</p><p>\u201cCome on. You know you want her to give you a hand.\u201d</p><p>Robert flushed. \u201cNo...no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar,\u201d Joe said with a laugh.</p><p>Robert\u2019s blush deepened. \u201cAll right. It\u2019s the missing prostitutes. After each disappearance we put men out on the street to ask a zillion questions that never have any answers. Mostly, we scratch our heads. Then the furor dies down and I\u2019m left with a bunch of useless information that does me no good the next time. All in all, if I\u2019m right and the cases are associated, we\u2019re talking about twelve missing women. In every case, they\u2019ve just vanished off the street.\u201d He looked across the table at Joe. \u201cIncluding the one who wasn\u2019t a hooker\u2014Genevieve O\u2019Brien.\u201d</p><p>Leslie looked at Joe. \u201cThe woman you\u2019re searching for,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI have to agree with Robert,\u201d he said. \u201cAt first, I wasn\u2019t sure, but the more I found out about just how involved she was with those women, the more sense it seemed to make. The best lead I have is that she stepped into a dark sedan. On the same street where half those girls worked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrange,\u201d Leslie murmured awkwardly. \u201cAnd you haven\u2019t found any bodies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo bodies. No blood. No sign of a struggle. Nothing,\u201d Robert said.</p><p>\u201cThere are a lot of ways for bodies to disappear,\u201d Joe reminded them.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Leslie said, \u201cyou\u2019re looking for someone who has learned how to completely hide his crimes. He must be very bright.\u201d She turned to Joe. \u201cDon\u2019t the profilers say that the usual age for a serial killer is between twenty-five and thirty-five?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOften,\u201d Joe agreed. \u201cBut not always.\u201d</p><p>Robert shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m glad you two have solved this thing.\u201d</p><p>They looked at each other sheepishly. \u201cSorry,\u201d Joe murmured.</p> <p>\u201cA dark sedan,\u201d Robert said. \u201cThat suggests middle class, probably white-collar. Maybe even someone who goes home after an abduction or murder to a wife and kids. Wouldn\u2019t be unusual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Joe agreed. \u201cBut let\u2019s not talk about murder over dinner, okay?\u201d</p><p>The salads came and went. Leslie spoke enthusiastically about her time in Virginia, and Joe made them laugh with a few of the funnier details from his recent case in Las Vegas. But when coffee came, Robert returned to the subject of the disappearances.</p><p>\u201cSo...you both think our missing women are dead? And our one man, the Mimic, was a tranny. He liked to dress up and walk the streets with the girls. I guess he was good at what he did.\u201d</p><p>Leslie hesitated. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I do think they\u2019re dead. I assume you\u2019ve had policewomen dressed up as prostitutes, working the same streets?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNights on end. As soon as we pull them off, our guy knows. Apparently he can smell a policewoman a mile away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen there\u2019s Genevieve. She wasn\u2019t a hooker, but she was close to them. Thing is, my witness says she went over to the car because she knew whoever was in it,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>\u201cPresumably someone respectable,\u201d Leslie said.</p><p>\u201cGreat. In a city of millions, I\u2019m now looking for someone respectable who drives a dark sedan,\u201d Robert said with a weary sigh. He frowned, looking at Joe. \u201cSo...now that you\u2019ve spoken with Eileen Brideswell and looked into Genevieve\u2019s disapearance, you seem to think that it\u2019s connected to my hookers, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>Robert gazed over at Leslie thoughtfully. \u201cWould you be willing to go to the street with me at night and see if...see if you get any hunches or vibes or whatever?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Leslie said after a brief hesitation.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Joe said flatly.</p><p>They both stared at him; Leslie was frowning.</p><p>\u201cIt would be better if she went with me. You\u2019re a nice cop, Robert, but you\u2019re still a cop. I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a private investigator. Do hookers like investigators any better?\u201d Robert asked.</p><p>\u201cFrankly, yes, they do.\u201d</p><p>It was Robert\u2019s turn to frown.</p><p>Leslie leaned forward. \u201cRobert, I\u2019ll help in any way I can, even though I honestly don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be able to help.\u201d If only he knew what led her to her discoveries, he wouldn\u2019t be so eager for her help, she thought. \u201cBut...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut?\u201d Robert asked, curious.</p><p>\u201cWe need help, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d</p><p>Robert stared across the table at them. Joe hoped he couldn\u2019t tell that he, too, had no idea what she was talking about.</p><p>\u201cIt was no accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are we talking about?\u201d Robert asked.</p><p>Liar, she thought. He knew. \u201cHastings House,\u201d she said.</p><p>Robert groaned. \u201cDon\u2019t you think I went over all the information we had with a fine-toothed comb?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t you think that explosion was pretty damn strange?\u201d Leslie demanded.</p><p>\u201cAccidents are strange. That\u2019s why they\u2019re accidents,\u201d Robert said testily. \u201cJoe, you\u2019ve been through the files. Everything points to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what everything points to. We both know that what\u2019s obvious is not necessarily the truth.\u201d</p><p>Robert groaned again. \u201cYou think some fanatic was trying to blow up the whole house? Why? Because he hates history and wants to see a skyscraper there?\u201d</p><p>Leslie shook her head gravely. \u201cNo. If someone wanted the whole house blown up, it would have been.\u201d</p><p>Robert looked at Joe. \u201cDid you instigate this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said gruffly, \u201cMatt was my cousin. Don\u2019t ask me to accept something just because everyone else thinks it\u2019s obvious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes, when the sun is shining, it\u2019s daytime,\u201d Robert snapped.</p><p>\u201cAnd sometimes, when it\u2019s dark, it\u2019s because there\u2019s an eclipse,\u201d Leslie snapped back.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right,\u201d Joe said with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cYou two loved Matt. You don\u2019t want to accept that he died because of a stupid accident. I get it. But he\u2019s gone, and it was an accident. You have to learn to live with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt wasn\u2019t the only one who died that night,\u201d Leslie said.</p><p>\u201cBut the thing is,\u201d Joe added, \u201cI don\u2019t think it was an accident, and I can\u2019t help but think that Matt was targeted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTargeted?\u201d Robert said. \u201cOh, come on!\u201d</p><p>Joe was surprised when Leslie plunged in more quickly than he could. \u201cTargeted. He was in the back room, and it was the back room that blew up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause that\u2019s where the build-up in the line was,\u201d Robert said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll let me have the files again?\u201d Joe demanded.</p><p>Robert threw up his hands. \u201cI\u2019ll get you the files.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not enough,\u201d Leslie said stubbornly. \u201cIf we need you to do something, you\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are...a mule,\u201d he told Leslie.</p><p>\u201cMule? Well, I\u2019ve been called a cadaver dog before, so I guess mule is no worse.\u201d</p><p>Robert laughed. \u201cWas I the one who called you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. I don\u2019t remember. But mule will do just fine.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cMore hopeless causes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t they the best kind?\u201d she teased.</p><p>Robert rolled his eyes, but he was smiling.</p><p>Leslie lifted her beer. \u201cTo us\u2014and a solution to all our mysteries.\u201d</p><p>Joe felt a moment\u2019s unease. He didn\u2019t know why. Maybe because Leslie seemed so fearless.</p><p>\u201cTo us\u2014and a solution to all our mysteries,\u201d Robert repeated. There was no skepticism in his voice, but there was no assurance, either.</p><p>\u201cTo us,\u201d Joe added simply.</p><p>Soon after, they left. Joe had left his car on the street near Hastings House. Robert offered them a lift, but it was only a few blocks back and the night was pleasant, so they opted to walk.</p><p>They walked in companionable silence for several minutes. Then she turned to him with a smile, her eyes bright. \u201cI have to know, just like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe may never discover anything. Maybe it really was an accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t believe it,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike Robert said, we both loved Matt,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>\u201cI know, but...\u201d</p><p>Her words hung in the air. He was startled when, a moment later, she slipped her arm through his. Startled, and pleased, despite himself. She was counting on him as a friend, he thought.</p><p>Screw it, Matt. I can\u2019t help it. Damn, you were a lucky man.</p><p>He vowed to be the friend she needed without turning into a stinking lech. She had enough of those around her. She was strong. She could handle herself. But he still felt a sudden urge to smash Hank Smith\u2019s face.</p><p>Yeah, what about your own?</p><p>No way out of it. She was sheer seduction. Just by walking, talking...being.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s the house,\u201d he said, his voice husky as they turned a corner and Hastings House came into view.</p><p>\u201cThe house,\u201d she repeated softly, and she seemed distant for a minute.</p><p>When they reached the door, he knew that he didn\u2019t dare go in.</p><p>She didn\u2019t ask him.</p><p>In fact, it seemed that she changed a little, once they were there.</p><p>\u201cThat was a great dinner. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Nothing like discussing serial killers over a meal.\u201d</p><p>She smiled sadly at that. \u201cThey\u2019re out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it seems that there\u2019s one working this area. You be careful. Really careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I actually go anywhere,\u201d she told him. \u201cTo work...and tonight I was out with you and Robert. I think I\u2019m safe enough.... Well, good night, and thank you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen do you want to take a walk on the wild side?\u201d she asked abruptly, surprising him.</p><p>\u201cWhenever you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf your day isn\u2019t too exhausting,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be. Digging is fun, and luckily, the guys like to do the talking.\u201d</p><p>She stood on her toes and kissed his cheek.</p><p>\u201cGood night. Set that alarm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>She went in. He listened, and could just hear her keying the alarm. Satisfied, he started down the walk, head bowed in thought as he turned onto the sidewalk and headed toward his car.</p><p>He heard the sudden revving of a motor.</p><p>He looked up just as a dark sedan shot past him on the quiet night street. He was in time to catch two numbers at the end of the license plate.</p><p>Six-three.</p><p>He looked back.</p><p>Where the hell had the car come from? The prostitutes\u2019 favorite corner wasn\u2019t far, only about four blocks down, one over.</p><p>He swore and raced toward his own car.</p><p>But he was too late, and he knew it. By the time he reached the corner of Broadway, there was nothing in sight but a Hummer and three taxis.</p><p>He stopped, irrationally tempted to go back to check on Leslie. In the rearview mirror, Hastings House seemed to look back at him like a living thing. Lights in the upstairs windows could have been eyes. The fanlight above the door could have been a mouth.</p><p>Upstairs, a light went out.</p><p>The alarm was on, he told himself. State-of-the-art. And the house wasn\u2019t far from One Police Plaza. She was safe. And he had to face it; she hadn\u2019t wanted to let him in.</p><p>Still, he drove back. He knew he should have been totally focused on finding Genevieve O\u2019Brien, but he also knew he was doing all the right things, following the right leads. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Was the girl already dead?</p><p>There was no way to know. Not until he discovered the truth of where she had gone, and why.</p><p>Alone in the night, he swore out loud, drove around the block and parked again.</p> <p>In front of Hastings House.</p><p>Where he spent the night, dozing in his car.</p><p>8</p><p>M att didn\u2019t come to her that night.</p><p>Leslie lay awake for a long time, waiting, yearning for him to appear in the flesh.</p> <p>Then she punched her pillows and made herself go to sleep, willing him into her dreams. But she woke early, all too aware that there had been no Matt\u2014not even dreams of Matt\u2014during the night. She rose, running her fingers through the tangles in her hair, and looked around.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI know you\u2019re here. Please...you have to let me see you.\u201d</p><p>Silence was her only answer.</p><p>Even though it was ridiculously early, she knew she wasn\u2019t going back to sleep, so she showered and dressed for the day, then went downstairs to make the coffee. It was when she was pouring water into the pot that she saw something with her peripheral vision. She held still for a moment, until she realized that the pot had overflowed and the water was running over her hands. She turned it off and looked toward the hearth.</p><p>Where she saw a woman apparently stirring something in a large pot hung over a ghostly fire.</p><p>Leslie remained silent, watching. The woman was young, pretty, wearing a mobcap over her soft blond hair.</p> <p>After a long moment, Leslie spoke to her. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t leave,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>The woman froze; Leslie was sure she was about to fade away to nothing.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Leslie said very softly. \u201cWho are you? Why are you here?\u201d</p><p>The woman began to fade, then became more visible again.</p><p>\u201cI was betrayed,\u201d she said. Her eyes became great pools of tears. \u201cBy one I trusted. One I loved,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Suddenly she spasmed, arching slightly backward, then slumped forward and faded away completely.</p><p>Leslie inhaled, staring for a very long timeat the spot where the woman had stood. But the woman was gone, and she knew it. Still, she felt a sense of elation. The apparition had not just appeared; it had spoken to her.</p><p>She turned, newly invigorated and wide awake, and finished making the coffee. A few minutes later, she heard a noise at the front door and Melissa came in. \u201cYou\u2019re up early.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re at work early,\u201d Leslie replied.</p><p>Melissa nodded. \u201cI have some paperwork to finish. I can\u2019t stop thinking about last night, though. I\u2019m sure this house is haunted. I think a ghost put that missing money back on the table for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho knows?\u201d Leslie said thoughtfully, then frowned suddenly. \u201cMelissa, how long have you worked here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I was hired right before they had that party to open the place, but then they had to close it for a while because...well, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what happened then?\u201d Leslie asked.</p><p>\u201cGreta\u2014she insists we call her Greta\u2014said she was sorry, but the society couldn\u2019t afford to keep us on while the house was being repaired, so I told her I\u2019d just take a temporary job and come back here once it opened again. I love this house. I would never give up an opportunity to work here. And now that I know it\u2019s haunted...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>Melissa pointed a finger at her. \u201cYou know it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do?\u201d</p><p>Melissa gave her a smile as if to say it was okay that she was trying to pull the wool over her eyes. \u201cYou know it\u2019s haunted. You\u2019re special.\u201d</p><p>Leslie felt uneasy, as if she belonged in some carnival freak show. \u201cMelissa...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you see a ghost, you\u2019ll let me know, right?\u201d Melissa implored.</p><p>\u201cSure. If we\u2019re standing here and a ghost appears, I\u2019ll let you know. And you let me know, too, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was one here yesterday. That\u2019s why the books balanced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we have a ghost who used to be a CPA, huh?\u201d</p><p>Melissa frowned and looked hurt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just teasing you,\u201d Leslie said quickly. \u201cWho\u2019s to say a ghost didn\u2019t help you, right?\u201d Leslie said, then went on to say, \u201cIf you still want to help with the dig, I\u2019ll arrange for you to come help on Saturday, how\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Melissa looked as if she were experiencing pure rapture for the first time in her life.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Leslie said. \u201cI\u2019m going to head over there now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis early?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like to get to the site ahead of the crowd.\u201d</p><p>Melissa nodded sagely. \u201cBetter for getting vibes, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter for working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI brought doughnuts\u2014you want one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love one, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I keep eggs and bread and sandwich stuff in the fridge, too. You can help yourself.\u201d</p><p>Leslie helped herself to a doughnut. \u201cThanks. I owe you big time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my pleasure.\u201d</p><p>She wolfed down the doughnut, finished her coffee and thanked Melissa again. Then she headed out.</p><p>She was surprised to see Joe\u2019s car parked across the street. Frowning, she walked over to it. He looked up before she reached him, looking a little dismayed. But he had been sitting there going through files, and he didn\u2019t try to hide them.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said, her tone turning the simple word into a question.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said sheepishly.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing out here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He lowered his lashes for a moment, then slid on a pair of dark glasses, effectively shielding whatever thoughts might have been evident in his eyes. He shrugged. \u201cI saw a dark sedan leaving here last night. Just thought I should stick around.\u201d</p><p>She smiled slowly, a little irritated, but mostly grateful. \u201cYou\u2019ve been here all night?\u201d she asked him. \u201cThanks. I think. But, come on, you\u2019re a private investigator. How many dark sedans do you think there are in New York?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, more than a few. Want a ride to work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple of blocks?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWant a walk to work?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>He got out of the car. The sun was just beginning to come up over the southern tip of Manhattan. Skyscrapers reached up toward the heavens, bathed in a delicate pink light. There was no hustle and bustle yet. The muted pastels hid the sins of the city, cloaking the trash and decay.</p><p>She glanced over at Joe as they walked. He reminded her so much of Matt. She wanted to be close to him. Feel protected by his height and size. Touch his hair, stroke his shoulders.</p><p>Because he reminded her of Matt, she told herself. Which was a bad reason.</p><p>And it wasn\u2019t fair to him at all. He was a fine man in his own right.</p><p>\u201cBy the way, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you lost someone, too. A girl...\u201d</p><p>He gazed at her, offered a rueful smile, shrugged. \u201cThat was a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you ever really forget?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t forget, but you do go on. You learn to laugh when you remember good things. A certain smile, a way of doing something. Oh, there\u2019s the guilt, too, of course. Why am I alive, when someone who deserved to live so much is gone? I\u2019ve made my peace with the past.\u201d He was silent a minute. \u201cEventually, you will, too. It\u2019s harder when it\u2019s not the natural order of things, though. I still miss my parents, but they had a great life together. I honestly think my father died of loneliness after he lost my mother, but they were older and it was their time. But when it\u2019s someone young, cheated out of a natural life span, I guess we can\u2019t help but be bitter. But the truth is, long or short, life is a gift, and so long as we\u2019re alive, we need to appreciate that fact.\u201d</p><p>She grinned at him. \u201cTrust me, I am grateful to be alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you have to live your life to the fullest. Not just for yourself but for Matt. Follow your dreams. Look to the future.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cWell, for me, that means digging for the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d He slipped his hand around hers and squeezed it.</p><p>A policewoman stationed on the corner near the dig gave them a pleasant nod. Leslie noticed that there was a greater police presence around the entire site than there had been previously. She stopped walking and looked around for a moment. So much that was new had been built on top of so much that was old, so much that was underground. Hastings House had been part of the Underground Railroad. She smiled ruefully to herself. She didn\u2019t know why that thought kept recurring to her. The word underground didn\u2019t always mean literally \u201cunder the ground,\u201d she reflected. Sometimes it meant below the scope of authority.</p><p>New York was definitely an underground city in every sense of the word.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the big excitement?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re staring awful hard at something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry\u2014just looking at the site and the buildings and...Just looking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew York. Gotta love it,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>\u201cI do. Look at all the cops. I guess someone decided to step up security,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYour little \u2018accident\u2019 yesterday turned this into a major find,\u201d Joe reminded her.</p><p>At the gate, there were two guards. Leslie started to reach for her identification, but the taller one nodded at her and said, \u201cWe all know you, Miss MacIntyre. Come on in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll leave you here,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll see you tonight. If you\u2019re awake,\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be awake,\u201d he promised her.</p><p>She walked on through the temporary wire gates that allowed entry to the site and carefully made her way through the grid, heading straight for the entry to the crypt.</p><p>Glow lights that couldn\u2019t possibly catch fire had been set in two corners of the room. Leslie left them where they were and fumbled in her bag for her flashlight. Turning that on, she looked around. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Laymon, bless him, had already staked out his territory. Large signs propped against two niches in the wall read Do Not Touch!!!</p><p>But there was no such sign on the niche where Brad and Laymon had found the record book. She hoped it hadn\u2019t already been taken away to be preserved. She felt a little guilty, knowing that any touch might injure the old paper, but she had a feeling she might find a reference to the woman whose remains she had found, as well as to the child, Mary, and she was determined to find the little girl\u2019s remains so she could reunite mother and child.</p><p>Very carefully, she moved to the niche and found the book. Leather-bound, and protected for so many years in this sealed environment, it was in far better shape than she had dared to hope. Then again, she reminded herself, some books\u2014well, scrolls\u2014had survived for millennia.</p> <p>A breath of cold air suddenly seemed to sweep around her. She frowned and looked over her shoulder. The place was in shadow, but she could tell she was alone. Even so...</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d she said softly.</p><p>She frowned. There could certainly be more ghosts here, of course, but she hadn\u2019t felt the sense that some disembodied being from a different time had joined her, even though surely there were at least a few here. She was certain that some of the people interred in this earth had died violent or miserable deaths. No, she had felt a breeze. Movement. Not just the chill that some suggested accompanied ghosts, but a real breeze. As if someone or something had joined her in the crypt and disturbed the air by moving.</p><p>She shrugged. Strange. Even when she had first started seeing ghosts, she hadn\u2019t felt such a sudden chill. She had felt fear, but only the natural fear of the unknown. She had never felt the sense of unease that had ridden on that breeze, a feeling of something icy, like a warning trickle down her spine.</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d she said aloud, then focused on the shadows. The room wasn\u2019t that big. She was obviously alone.</p> <p>Gritting her teeth, she dismissed the strange sensation and returned her attention to the book.</p><p>As she had hoped, it was the parish register, filled with the dates of weddings, births and, of course, deaths.</p><p>She didn\u2019t run her fingers down the pages. She would never disrespect such a precious relic that way. But her eyes roamed. The book had been kept by a Father Browne, and his script was clear, with only a slight flourish. So many people. These were not the rich and famous, though she was sure there were a few rabble-rousers among them, since most of the entries were from the 1850s, when gang violence had been rampant. The Times had written about the desperate throngs, saying that the streets had been filled with ruffians, and there had been no promise of safety anywhere in the disorderly metropolis. May 1849 had brought the Astor Place riots, with many dying when a mob had protested the appearance of the aristocratic English actor William Macready, believing the role of Macbeth belonged to American luminary Edwin Forrest. Had a theatrical question really created such a stir, or had the true cause been the great chasm growing between the rich and poor of the city? Most people believed that the wretched living conditions of so many had lain behind the violence, fanned into action on the pretext of cultural controversy.</p><p>She went back and quickly noted that some of the earliest recorded deaths in the book were from May 1849. She wondered if any of the deceased had met their fates during the riots.</p><p>Next she went carefully, page by page, looking for a child named Mary.</p><p>She found ten of them. With a sigh, she knew she was going to have to find out Mary\u2019s surname before she could go any further.</p> <p>Bit by bit she grew aware of a slight noise, like a muted shuffle. She had been so intent on the records, she realized, that she had forgotten her strange feeling of a few minutes earlier.</p><p>There really did seem to be something\u2014someone?\u2014hidden in the shadows behind her.</p><p>She straightened, determined that she wasn\u2019t about to start being afraid of the dark.</p><p>No good.</p><p>Closing the book, she turned, certain she had heard a noise. But no matter how intently she peered into the room\u2019s dark corners, there didn\u2019t seem to be anyone else there. Shifting earth, she thought. Or a breeze coming in through the hole in the wall where she had originally fallen through. They needed to shore up the place before they did much more work in it or allowed more people in, she decided.</p><p>She turned back to the niche where the book had lain, hoping more treasures might be stored there.</p><p>As she turned, she knew. Knew.</p><p>Someone was behind her.</p> <p>Someone was there with her, unseen, hidden, but how? Where?</p><p>She started to turn.</p><p>Too late.</p><p>She felt a sudden, fierce pain knife through the back of her head. She staggered against the wall and fell.</p><p>Back at his car, Joe stared across the street to Hastings House and saw the door open. The woman in charge of ticketing came out, Melissa...something, he recalled. He\u2019d talked to her in the course of investigating the explosion.</p><p>She looked up at the house, stretched and smiled. He felt as if he were interrupting a personal moment, her pleasure in just being there was so evident.</p><p>He walked over to her anyway. \u201cMelissa, good morning.\u201d</p><p>For a moment she stared at him as if she were seeing a ghost.</p><p>\u201cOh, hi. Sorry. We\u2019ve met...right? You\u2019re Joe Connolly, the P.I.? You look so much like your cousin. I talked to you after the explosion, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. And I\u2019m friends with Leslie.\u201d He didn\u2019t see any reason to tell her that they\u2019d just met a few days ago.</p><p>\u201cWould you like some coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>He followed her inside, wondering why he felt that just being in the house would somehow help him.</p><p>\u201cLeslie is phenomenal,\u201d Melissa said as they reached the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cYes, she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoughnut?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoughnuts get such a bad rap these days,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cOnce in a while, they\u2019re good for the soul,\u201d he said.</p><p>Melissa looked around the kitchen. \u201cI do love this house so much. Oh!\u201d She blushed, realizing how she sounded. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I know that your cousin...well, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the fault of the house, Melissa,\u201d he said.</p><p>She leaned toward him, a slightly faraway look in her eyes. \u201cMaybe it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe...I don\u2019t know. This house makes me feel...weird. Can a house be jinxed...or...evil?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He arched a brow. \u201cNo,\u201d he said firmly.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not bad vibes I get here. In fact, I should get bad vibes, after what happened, but...I get good ones. If the place is haunted, though...it could be Revolutionary War ghosts, or Civil War ghosts, or Irish gang ghosts....\u201d She got a faraway look in her eyes, as if she\u2019d traveled back in time herself.</p><p>Joe stared at her, feeling a strange creeping sensation along his nape. Hell. He was six foot three and two hundred and twenty pounds of muscle. He\u2019d faced cold-blooded killers in his time, and he sure as hell wasn\u2019t afraid of the dark. So how the hell had this tiny woman given him the shivers? But it wasn\u2019t her, he realized.</p><p>It was the house.</p><p>Oh, like hell.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t at the party that night, were you?\u201d he asked Melissa.</p><p>\u201cMe? No. I\u2019m just the hired help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re far more than hired help,\u201d he told her, and watched her flush. She seemed to thrive on the least compliment. Earnest and sincere, and not homely but also not a raving beauty, she had probably worked hard for every achievement in her life. She deserved a few compliments, he decided.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t here, either, were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t.\u201d A strange sense of cold suddenly washed over him as he spoke. He looked around, thinking there had to be an air-conditioning vent somewhere near, but he didn\u2019t see one.</p><p>Then, inexplicably, while he was just standing there, he lost his balance and stumbled.</p><p>Disturbed, he frowned and strode past Melissa into the back servants\u2019 pantry, where the explosion had happened. Everything was perfectly restored now, but even so, he walked over and stood by the hearth, wondering exactly where Matt had been standing.</p><p>An odd sense of pressure filled his head.</p><p>Leslie...</p><p>He must be going crazy. He could have sworn he heard her name, but there was no one else in the room.</p><p>He felt torn between the urge to stay and discover what was going on here to spook him and the irrational urge to run back to the dig site to see Leslie, as if she were in danger.</p><p>He felt almost as if he were pushed to join her, as if a strange whisper in his head was urgently telling him to go to her.</p><p>Ridiculous. She was working and perfectly safe.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Melissa asked, looking at him from the doorway.</p><p>\u201cNothing. Nothing at all. Thanks for the doughnut. I\u2019ll be seeing you.\u201d</p><p>He was out of the house in a flash and found himself running down the street toward the dig.</p><p>She blinked. There was a blinding light shining in her eyes, and for a moment she thought she was staring at a monster, then realized it was a man.</p><p>Professor Laymon was staring down at her, the light from his electric lantern reflected in the lenses of his glasses, his gaunt face made eerie by the play of light and shadow.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine,\u201d he announced to someone outside her field of vision. \u201cShe\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>A monster? Or a man? Someone had hit her.</p><p>She kept silent, suddenly suspicious.</p><p>\u201cWe need to call 911,\u201d she heard Brad announce worriedly.</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d she said, waving a hand in the air, sitting up. The dark room swayed for a minute, but then her vision cleared almost instantly. She looked around and frowned. She definitely wasn\u2019t alone anymore. And she wasn\u2019t by the wall anymore, either. She was sitting in a pile of rubble, halfway across the room.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see\u2014\u201d she began.</p><p>\u201cYou got a good clunk on the head,\u201d Brad said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA clunk on the head?\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cFrom the ceiling,\u201d Laymon explained. \u201cA chunk of plaster fell on you. We need to install proper safety precautions in here.\u201d</p><p>There was a commotion just outside, and suddenly Joe Connolly was pushing through the entrance. He rushed over to her, looking like a fullback ready to face the opponent\u2019s starting line, and stared reproachfully at Brad and Laymon. She followed the direction of his accusing gaze to see Robert Adair standing nearby, looking acutely uncomfortable. And when she squinted toward the entrance, she saw a host of workers and more policemen, including Ken Dryer, looking in at her. Hank Smith was there, too, she noticed.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d Joe demanded gruffly.</p><p>\u201cTime\u2014and a weak chunk of ceiling,\u201d Brad explained. He stared at Joe and apparently decided that he had some influence over her. \u201cShe should see a doctor. She took a real bump to her head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see to it,\u201d Joe agreed.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she protested, gritting her teeth as she got to her feet. Had she really been hit by a piece of the ceiling? Had she imagined the cold, and the sense of someone else being there? Whatever had really happened, she wasn\u2019t about to protest their explanation. Not unless and until she had something to offer instead that wouldn\u2019t make her sound crazy. Even so...\u201cNo,\u201d she repeated. \u201cI mean it.\u201d She could hear anxious voices from outside, and she forced herself to take a step on her own. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not fine,\u201d Brad said.</p> <p>\u201cI am fine,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better to be safe than sorry,\u201d Joe warned. He looked seriously worried. What was he doing there? she wondered. He\u2019d stayed in his car all night to keep an eye on her, not to mention he undoubtedly wanted a shower and a change of clothing. Plus, he had a missing woman to find.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right, you know,\u201d Robert Adair said.</p><p>\u201cIt couldn\u2019t have been all that bad,\u201d Laymon put in. \u201cShe seems fine to me.\u201d</p><p>She looked at the professor. She knew that he cared about her. She also knew that he cared more about his work than about any human being. If she\u2019d been hurt badly enough to require a doctor, the city might insist on shutting down the dig until their safety inspectors okayed it. Laymon would be fit to be tied. The ceiling undoubtedly had to be shored up, but he would want to supervise, to be in charge. He wouldn\u2019t want his precious find contaminated in any way.</p><p>\u201cThe professor\u2019s right. I really am absolutely fine,\u201d she repeated firmly.</p> <p>Robert shook his head. Laymon sighed. Brad stared at her.</p><p>Joe took her by the arm, turning her to face him. \u201cFine, huh? So you say. Let\u2019s take a little trip back to Hastings House, get some ice, keep you moving...and maybe stop by a doctor\u2019s, quietly, just so he can take a quick look at you, check you out.\u201d</p><p>Brad spoke up in support of Joe.</p><p>\u201cLeslie, you were flat on your back, out cold, when we found you.\u201d</p><p>The light was blocked for a minute, and then she saw Ken Dryer\u2014clearly not at all happy about what the dirt was doing to his clothing\u2014slide carefully down to join them. \u201cLeslie, what happened? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>She knew she should be grateful, but everyone\u2019s concern was starting to get on her nerves. And in the back of her mind was a question. What had really happened? Had she turned to look around, been hit on the head by a falling piece of plaster, and fallen this far away from where she\u2019d been standing?</p><p>For a moment, she once again felt that strange sense of fear that had prickled at her nape when she\u2019d been alone in the room. She wasn\u2019t accustomed to being afraid. The dark didn\u2019t usually hold any terrors for her.</p><p>After all, she didn\u2019t just see ghosts. She carried on conversations with them.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk you home,\u201d Joe said gruffly. \u201cAnd see you to the doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe needs her head examined,\u201d Brad said. Leslie looked at him, frowning. The way he\u2019d said it, it sounded as if he thought more was wrong with her than a possible concussion.</p><p>\u201cGuys...\u201d she murmured uncomfortably.</p><p>\u201cLeslie, the site isn\u2019t going anywhere,\u201d Laymon told her, his voice unusually gentle. Apparently there was a soul somewhere beneath that academic facade.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to go out the back or else face the music out front,\u201d Brad said. He shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know how, but the minute anything happens, we get a flock of reporters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDryer can handle them, I\u2019m sure,\u201d Robert Adair said.</p><p>Brad grinned at her. \u201cI\u2019ll join him,\u201d he said with a rueful smile.</p><p>\u201cGo to it,\u201d Leslie told him, smiling in return. \u201cI\u2019ll see you all later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t. You\u2019ll take the day off,\u201d Laymon said firmly Brad halted at the exit.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Joe said, equally firm.</p><p>Maybe they were right. But she didn\u2019t feel at death\u2019s door. She had one hell of a headache, but she could handle that with aspirin. Mostly, she realized, she was angry at being unable to figure out what the hell had happened.</p><p>\u201cLeslie, I\u2019ll bring in my own engineers, and I\u2019ll sit on top of them like a fly on roadkill,\u201d Laymon said.</p><p>\u201cLeslie, let\u2019s go,\u201d Joe repeated quietly.</p><p>For a minute she was tempted to remind him that she wasn\u2019t a child, and that even though he looked like Matt, he wasn\u2019t Matt. They didn\u2019t have a relationship that stretched back forever. But she knew they were probably right. An exam or an X-ray wouldn\u2019t hurt. It would be the mature and sensible thing to do.</p><p>As she headed for the exit, Robert set a hand on her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d</p><p>As she emerged from the crypt, a group of workers backed away in a single body. She smiled and waved. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said reassuringly. \u201cGo on back to work\u2014we\u2019ve got a lot to do.\u201d</p><p>With Joe holding her arm and Brad on the other side of her, they walked across the site in the direction of the back exit. Suddenly she stopped, pulling him to a halt with her.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>She looked around. \u201cWho found me?\u201d she asked quietly.</p><p>Brad frowned. \u201cLaymon and I. You were flat on the ground, unconscious. We were really scared, Leslie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, why?\u201d Brad asked.</p><p>\u201cNo one else was in there with me, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Why?\u201d Brad asked, looking puzzled.</p><p>\u201cRight. Of course.\u201d She forced a smile, said goodbye to Brad as he joined Dryer and started walking again.</p><p>Joe and Leslie departed via the rear and in a few minutes they were approaching Hastings House.</p><p>The morning rush was on and the sidewalks were full. Odd. Around the site, she couldn\u2019t move without someone stopping her. Here\u2014even dirty and tousled\u2014she was barely noticed. Serious, almost grim-faced businessmen and women were headed to their financial district offices. One man looked so depressed that she wanted to tell him to lighten up.</p><p>She looked at Joe, who wore a frown, as well. She smiled. \u201cWell, I guess it\u2019s a good thing you didn\u2019t shower yet,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He glanced at her and seemed surprised by her easy grin. \u201cWhat happened in there?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She frowned. \u201cA chunk of ceiling fell. Hey, that place has been buried for a century. Not even the Pyramids have survived without some damage, and this place was nowhere near that well built.\u201d She was trying to make him smile. No dice.</p><p>\u201cI wonder if you should be working that dig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? It\u2019s what I do.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cIn fact,\u201d she said thoughtfully, staring at him, \u201chow did you happen to be there?\u201d</p><p>He stared straight ahead and didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cJoe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said at last, almost unwillingly.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, you don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, I don\u2019t know. I just...\u201d He stopped speaking, shook his head again. \u201cI just had a feeling I should go find you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, really. Instinct, fluke\u2014I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that was really sweet of you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSweet?\u201d He stared at her as if she\u2019d lost her mind.</p><p>\u201cYes, it was very nice of you to worry.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply to that, but his strides increased.</p><p>\u201cHey, slow down. I\u2019m a fast walker, but I\u2019m practically running to keep up with you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>Then they were at the house. It wasn\u2019t officially open yet, but the door was ajar and Melissa popped out just as they started up the steps.</p><p>\u201cLeslie, are you all right?\u201d she cried anxiously, hurrying out to greet her.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Leslie said, frowning. \u201cWhat\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe news announced that there had been an accident,\u201d Melissa said, then gave Joe a strange look. \u201cYou went from here to the site?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Melissa said, looking at him in wonder.</p><p>\u201cHey there, is everyone all right?\u201d</p><p>Leslie looked toward the entrance. Jeff Green, in complete Colonial grab, was standing in the doorway, his face wearing an expression of concern. Leslie had to smile. He could have been an eighteenth-century gentleman, standing on his porch to survey his domain. He reminded her a little bit of Ichabod Crane at that moment, rather than Washington, because, seen from below, he was so tall and lean.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s fine,\u201d she said as he, too, stepped outside. He ruined the impression of historical perfection when he reached into his Colonial jacket pocket and produced a pack of Marlboros. He lit up, still frowning. \u201cMelissa and I had the TV in the office on and we heard what happened. That policeman\u2014Dryer\u2014came on to say that everything was all right, but that\u2019s what the cops always say. We couldn\u2019t help being worried.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThanks for your concern. I\u2019m pretty dirty and I\u2019ve got a headache, but that\u2019s about it,\u201d Leslie said.</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d Joe began.</p><p>She stepped on his foot. He looked down at her, brows lowering. She stared at him, and he smiled in understanding. She was grateful, but growing weary of constantly saying that she was fine.</p> <p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Tandy?\u201d Leslie asked, changing the subject.</p><p>\u201cUnless we have school groups or a major tour scheduled, she takes Wednesdays off and I have Thursdays, and we both take Sunday,\u201d he explained.</p><p>\u201cWe pull in our biggest crowds on Friday and Saturday,\u201d Melissa explained. \u201cWe should be open on Sundays, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Sabbath?\u201d Jeff protested, sounding convincingly Colonial. Then he grinned. \u201cHey, I like my Sundays off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could work them. And we could make big bucks,\u201d Melissa said.</p> <p>\u201cWell, if you guys don\u2019t mind, I\u2019m going to go in and shower,\u201d Leslie said. She looked at Joe. He was dirty and covered in plaster dust, as well.</p><p>It occurred to her that, concealed in his strangely tinted shield of grime, he could pass for the ghost of his cousin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>\u201cYou could go home and shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could, but I won\u2019t. I\u2019ll take you to my buddy, Dr. Granger, first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoctor! What\u2019s wrong?\u201d Melissa demanded, her voice full of concern.</p> <p>\u201cJoe will explain,\u201d Leslie said. He\u2019d opened his mouth, so he could take care of telling them what had happened, she decided.</p><p>She entered the house and rushed up the stairs. In her room, she quickly shed her dirty clothing, turned on the water and stepped into the shower. The heat washed over her deliciously, and she turned up the force of the water. She always tried to conserve resources where she could. At that moment, though, she was grateful that the Historical Association had installed modern plumbing and a really good water heater. She let the steam roll around her and the water beat down. Washing her hair, she felt the bump on the top of her head. Not really all that bad, she told herself.</p><p>As she stood there, she began to feel the oddest sensation, as if she were being cradled by the steam and the water. Tenderly held.</p><p>She stood dead still. Was it her imagination? Or...?</p><p>\u201cMatt?\u201d she said softly, her voice almost lost against the rushing of the water.</p><p>There was no reply.</p><p>Just the sensation.</p><p>So she stood, water and heat cascading all around her, barely breathing. Wondering. It was as if she were being held with such a gentle touch because she had just survived a great danger and returned home. As if she were a soldier who had been off to war and come home at last, despite the danger.</p> <p>A loud knocking on her bedroom door broke the spell.</p><p>She realized that the water\u2014no matter how good the heater was\u2014had grown cold.</p><p>She turned it off quickly, wrapped herself in a towel and hurried out.</p><p>\u201cLeslie?\u201d Joe. And he sounded worried.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay\u2014sorry.\u201d</p><p>She heard him swear. \u201cI was about to break the door down! I\u2019d thought you\u2019d passed out in the shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...I got carried away enjoying the steam and the heat,\u201d she replied. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ll be right out, I swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake your time. I was just worried.\u201d</p><p>She heard his footsteps recede down the hall.</p><p>Shaking, she sat at the foot of the bed.</p><p>\u201cMatt?\u201d she said aloud again.</p><p>Nothing, no sense that he was there, not even the hint of a breeze from beyond...</p><p>She was losing her mind. No. She knew better; she knew that sometimes, something remained after death. She knew that ghosts did exist.</p><p>But what about this particular ghost?</p><p>Was she inventing him, just because she so desperately wanted to see him?</p><p>\u201cMatt?\u201d she repeated softly.</p><p>But there was still nothing.</p><p>Nothing at all.</p><p>She dressed quickly, choosing good walking sandals and a black knit dress, not at all certain what the rest of the day\u2014and the night\u2014would bring.</p><p>She dried her hair and applied some makeup.</p><p>But when she was ready, she paused again. \u201cMatt. I know you\u2019re here. You have to be here. And...I want you to know that Joe and I are going to find out exactly what happened. And, Matt, I know you know this, but...I love you so much.\u201d</p><p>Loved, she reminded herself. Loved. Matt was...</p><p>Dead.</p><p>\u201cI do love you,\u201d she whispered aloud. \u201cAnd I will discover the truth.\u201d</p><p>She started out the door...and was suddenly certain she felt a gentle touch at the base of her spine. She turned, but once again there was nothing.</p><p>She stood in the hallway, entirely alone.</p><p>9</p><p>T he doctor\u2019s visit turned out to be a total waste of time, at least in Leslie\u2019s opinion. She\u2019d insisted she was fine, and apparently she was right. She had a bump on her head but no concussion. Not unexpectedly, the doctor was concerned that she had blacked out, but she convinced him it had been for no more than a few seconds. He told her that she could check into a hospital for observation if she chose.</p><p>She didn\u2019t choose.</p><p>When they left the the doctor\u2019s office, Joe, who\u2019d cleaned up as best he could at Hastings House, decided that lunch would be a good option.</p><p>\u201cHungry?\u201d he asked Leslie.</p><p>\u201cSure. I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember, any sign of an upset stomach could mean something more serious,\u201d he warned her.</p><p>\u201cThe skull is the hardest bone in the body,\u201d she told him. \u201cDid you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that yours is hard,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m willing to bet yours is granite,\u201d she returned. \u201cLunch sounds good. But should you be wasting all this time on me? You have a girl to rescue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr a body to find,\u201d he said dully.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe that Genevieve is still alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to. But usually, in a case like this...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll pop in here,\u201d he said, opening the door to a pub.</p><p>She looked at him. \u201cAre you sure you have time? You really are spending too much time on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone could ever spend too much time on you,\u201d he told her. He said the words lightly, but he knew he meant every one of them.</p><p>\u201cVery gallant,\u201d she told. \u201cStill...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re at O\u2019Malley\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEileen Brideswell\u2019s favorite place. Not ostentatious, real Irish owners...a family hangout for the O\u2019Briens. I\u2019m sure Genevieve hung around here, too, so I can ask some questions while we\u2019re eating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd do you think that will really help you any?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she disappeared in a dark sedan and she was taken by someone she knew. It sounded as if it was a decent car, so I need to learn who she was hanging around with, and this might be one of the places where they spent time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAha.\u201d</p><p>A pretty woman with a broad Irish accent approached them with a smile of recognition for Joe and led them to a cozy booth.</p><p>\u201cSpecial is Irish bacon and cabbage,\u201d she told them. \u201cAnd, if I do say so myself, our potato soup is the best in New York.\u201d She grinned and added, \u201cMaybe in all of the New World.\u201d With a wink, she left them.</p><p>\u201cA friend?\u201d Leslie asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been here now and then,\u201d Joe said. \u201cBut I think she saw me with Eileen Brideswell, and that makes all the difference.\u201d</p><p>Their waitress approached them. She had dark hair, brilliant green eyes and a definite accent. Her name was Bridget.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like?\u201d Joe asked Leslie.</p><p>\u201cWhat else? Potato soup and the bacon and cabbage,\u201d she said, with a light in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cThe same,\u201d Joe told Bridget.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring the soup right out,\u201d Bridget promised with a bright smile and flashing eyes.</p><p>\u201cBridget, how long have you worked here?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cOh...well, since I came into the country. A bit over six months now, I\u2019ll be thinking.\u201d</p><p>Joe reached into his jacket and produced a picture of Genevieve O\u2019Brien. \u201cDid you know this girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGenevieve O\u2019Brien?\u201d A look of deep sorrow entered Bridget\u2019s eyes. \u201cThat I did,\u201d she said sadly. She stared at Joe. \u201cAh, you\u2019re the fellow looking for her, eh? For Mrs. Brideswell?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cDid she come in frequently?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now, I can\u2019t say frequently. But you know, she was working sometimes not far from here, so she had the occasional lunch here, yes. A lovely girl, she was. My heart breaks to think what might\u2019ve happened to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she come in alone?\u201d</p><p>A slow grin lifted Bridget\u2019s rosy cheeks. \u201cSometimes, yes. Sometimes she\u2019d be bringing a woman in with her, and they\u2019d be...well, all cleaned up. But I would kind of know when she would bring in a...well, I guess the term here would be \u2018working girl.\u2019 She tried to make life better for people.\u201d</p><p>Joe nodded, noticing the way Leslie was listening to Bridget, her own heart seeming to break for the girl she\u2019d never known.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in her booth, you know,\u201d Bridget said.</p><p>\u201cWe are?\u201d Leslie asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye. She had the same booth\u2014whenever it was free, of course. But Mrs. O\u2019Malley...\u201d She paused and indicated the hostess who had seated them. \u201cShe\u2019d often hold it open, thinking Miss O\u2019Brien might come by. The family was very supportive from the time her father-in-law, the elder Mr. O\u2019Malley\u2014he\u2019s retired now, left the place to his son\u2014first opened here. So Mrs. O\u2019Malley\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas she dating anyone, do you know?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just a waitress here,\u201d Bridget said.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean you might not have noticed if she had someone special. Did she ever come in here with a man?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>Bridget frowned. \u201cOnce or twice, I guess.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLunchtime? Cocktail hour? Dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw her in here with a fellow once or twice. I think the one man was her boss. And the other...well, I guess she worked with him, too.\u201d She offered a quick smile. \u201cThe one fellow was quite a looker. The boss...well, he wasn\u2019t ugly as sin or anything, but he was a grump. You\u2019ll have to excuse me now, please. I\u2019ve got food that needs serving.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and left them.</p><p>\u201cYou think she was dating someone who turned out to be...bad?\u201d Leslie asked Joe.</p><p>He shook his head thoughtfully, sipping the coffee Bridget had poured when she came to take their order. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t believe she was dating at all.\u201d He cocked his head, smiling ruefully. \u201cI\u2019ve done this a long time. I\u2019ve been through all the basics. I\u2019ve talked to her old friends, old flames. Her heaviest relationship was with a guy in college. He moved to Alaska to be a lumberjack and hasn\u2019t come back since. She had a hard time with her father, I know. He was the kind who demanded perfection. I think he spent most of his life trying to fight the \u2018lazy Irish\u2019 stereotype to show the world that the Irish were hardworking and intelligent, so much so that he never let her be a child.\u201d</p> <p>Leslie stared back at him, sipping her own coffee.</p><p>He went on. \u201cBut she loved him anyway. I\u2019m sure, when they had their last blowup and she walked away, she never imagined he would die before they made peace. She had a strong sense of family and really loved her aunt, too.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m pretty sure she plunged into work instead of taking time for a personal life\u2014and I think she was trying so hard with those prostitutes because she had listened to her father so long. I think she felt that helping women get off the streets was like reaching back into the past.\u201d He met her eyes as he spoke. \u201cA lot of Irish immigrants with nowhere else to turn became prostitutes, and I think Genevieve felt she was helping to make that right by helping these women now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think, if she were able to, she would contact her aunt?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>The potato soup arrived.</p> <p>He\u2019d enjoyed it before and was irrationally glad when Leslie said, \u201cIt really is the best potato soup ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never came here before?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cNever. It\u2019s a big city, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do know. It\u2019s just that...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she persisted.</p><p>\u201cWhen we were kids, Matt loved this place.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cWe ate in Brooklyn a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI eat in Brooklyn a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd there you go\u2014we never ran into each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been in New York a lot the past few years.\u201d</p><p>Bridget brought their plates, her bright green eyes smiling. \u201cSo many people think they\u2019re going to get a pack of fatty bacon strips on their plates.\u201d She frowned. \u201cI put the plates down and they say, \u2018Oh, goodness, the bacon\u2014it\u2019s like pork.\u2019 What do they think bacon is?\u201d she asked incredulously.</p><p>They both laughed politely.</p><p>Joe asked her, \u201cBridget, if I were to bring in pictures, do you think you\u2019d be able to recognize the men Genevieve came here with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would, I think. Most probably. The one fellow...it was cocktail hour. Dark and busy in here. I\u2019m not as sure about him, but I could try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDelighted to help,\u201d she said.</p><p>When she left, Leslie asked him, \u201cWhat pictures do you have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the moment, her boss\u2019s. A few old friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo there really is a method to your madness\u2014or at least your dining choices,\u201d Leslie said with a smile. He was glad to see she was eating well and really did seem to feel fine.</p><p>\u201cDo you still have a headache?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cOnly if I forget and touch my head,\u201d she told him, then stared at him seriously. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing that you showed up,\u201d she said.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cMaybe there is such a thing as ESP.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou doubt it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Why\u2014do you believe you have it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cESP? No. But there have been so many documented reports of it. I just read about one really sad situation. A mother woke up, sensing her daughter, who was serving in the army in the Middle East, was in danger. She called all over, trying to reach her daughter or at least find out how she was. It turned out she had been killed, just when her mother woke up, feeling so scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Joe murmured.</p><p>\u201cAnd there have been dozens of cases involving identical twins. Sometimes one just knew when the other one needed help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she said, grinning, \u201cyou must have ESP.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his cup to her, studying her face. \u201cYou know, Robert Adair is certain you have some kind of psychic gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho knows?\u201d she said lightly. \u201cShall we go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the check,\u201d he said.</p><p>It turned out that they didn\u2019t have one. Mrs. O\u2019Malley insisted on picking up the lunches, so he left a hefty tip for Bridget and they left.</p><p>\u201cI should go back to work,\u201d Leslie said.</p><p>\u201cYou were told not to. How about coming back out to my place for a while? I want to clean up and check my e-mail, and we can\u2019t look for Didi Dancer or any of the other girls until later.\u201d</p><p>For a moment she looked undecided. Then she shrugged. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>As they drove, Joe caught her looking pensively out the window. \u201cWhat\u2019s so interesting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCity above the ground, city below the ground,\u201d she replied.</p><p>He frowned. She grinned ruefully.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t get that thought out of my head, for some reason. Take the crypt we\u2019ve discovered. So much had been built on top of it that no one had any idea it was even there. Look at the city we see from the car, then take the subway and you don\u2019t see any of it. You\u2019re traveling like a mole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery true.\u201d He frowned, staring at her hard. \u201cWhat happened this morning?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. She didn\u2019t know him that well yet. She had to keep reminding herself that he wasn\u2019t Matt. \u201cA piece of the ceiling fell on me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey showed me where it caved in,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He lived in an old brownstone, the first floor and basement of which were his. He watched her examine the place as they entered. She looked around, smiling. He thought it was comfortable. He had a huge sofa and several armchairs in the living room, with an entertainment system in a polished oak cabinet facing it. There was an old hearth, and a display of the antique swords and rifles he had collected over the years. He had a surprisingly large kitchen, a nice dining area, a bedroom, an office and even an alcove that could function as a guest room. The basement hosted his pool table and some beat-up chairs.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d he inquired.</p><p>\u201cWell, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it rate okay?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cGreat bachelor quarters,\u201d she told him. With an amused grin, she added, \u201cVery manly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I get you anything\u2014I just want to check my e-mail and get cleaned up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019ll see if I approve of your music collection,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He left her, striding for his office. He\u2019d sent out a number of inquiries to people who might have information on Genevieve, but he had a hunch so strong that he was willing to put money on it that finding Genevieve hinged on finding the right dark sedan\u2014and the man driving it. Still, he had to go through the motions.</p><p>As he booted up the computer, he picked up the sleazy magazine with the story about Genevieve. It was one of those articles that began by praising a person, then started tearing her down inch by inch. He\u2019d never heard of the scandal before, but the article hinted of some affair around the time of Genevieve\u2019s birth, and talked about her father\u2019s coldly autocratic treatment of her. It was skillfully written, implying without directly saying anything that Genevieve might be the result of her mother\u2019s affair with another man. He leaned back. He\u2019d read the article many times already, but he felt as if he were missing something. He started to read it one more time.</p><p>Joe\u2019s place was warm and inviting. The furniture was solid and the wood was polished. She had a feeling he enjoyed spending time at home, but also that he didn\u2019t fuss over it. She assumed he had someone in to clean\u2014there wasn\u2019t much dust.</p><p>She wandered over to the cabinet and started going through Joe\u2019s CDs. As she did, she noticed movement behind her and turned.</p><p>A man in a New York Regimental uniform was sitting on the sofa; he looked as if he had belonged to some kind of Irish brigade.</p><p>He was intent, frowning, concentrating, as he stared at her.</p><p>\u201cYou can see me,\u201d he said after a moment.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can see me,\u201d he repeated, almost in awe.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said again.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not scared? You\u2019re not going to start screaming?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cNo. I mean, you don\u2019t intend me any harm, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarm to a lady?\u201d He sounded outraged.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I meant no offense.\u201d</p><p>He was about thirty-five, she thought, gaunt, and his face was prematurely wrinkled; he looked old for his age. But then, she imagined, war could easily do that to a man. His hair was sandy, and he had a small mustache and neatly trimmed beard. His eyes were a soft brown, emphasized by flyaway brows. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He still seemed to be in awe. Then he rose, smiling. \u201cForgive me,\u201d he said anxiously. He looked a little uncomfortable and rubbed his leg. \u201cPicked up some shell at Shiloh,\u201d he explained. \u201cPlease, sit.\u201d</p><p>She realized that he wouldn\u2019t sit again unless she did, so she perched on the edge of the chair, and he took a seat again. He continued to stare at her.</p><p>\u201cAll these years...kids coming, growing up, moving on...no one has ever seen me.\u201d</p> <p>She hesitated, speaking carefully. She was becoming more comfortable with her gift, and thanks to Nikki and Adam Harrison, she knew that all apparitions were different, that they often interacted with the living in different ways. Most of them wanted, or needed, something.</p><p>\u201cI see you,\u201d she said. Then she asked, \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t leave the music,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d He couldn\u2019t be talking about Joe\u2019s CD collection.</p><p>\u201cI had a march published, just before the war. And then an \u00e9tude. But...there was so much more. I didn\u2019t know if I was coming back or not\u2014no man did.\u201d A frown creased his brow again. \u201cYou\u2019re from the South,\u201d he said suddenly.</p> <p>\u201cOriginally. I\u2019ve lived in New York many years.\u201d She didn\u2019t have an accent, or at least only a very slight one, so how had he known?</p><p>He was looking at her warily now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to say that we\u2019re all one nation now,\u201d she said. How could she explain to him just how much had changed since the Civil War? Or that even now there were still remnants of that struggle that needed to be healed?</p><p>\u201cVery glad,\u201d she continued earnestly. \u201cAs one nation, we\u2019re strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hid my music, but when I came back...I wanted so badly to see more of it published. But I was always ill...my niece looked after me. When I died, she met a fine young lad. He\u2019d lost a leg at Gettysburg, but he was still a fine man, a whole man, even minus a limb. I was glad to watch them here. To see their children grow.\u201d He stopped reminiscing and looked at her again. \u201cMay I tell you about my music?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Joe set the article down, thinking he would pick it up again later. Whatever it said that he hadn\u2019t seen before, he wasn\u2019t getting it now, either. He\u2019d have to try again, with fresh eyes.</p><p>He ran through his e-mail, but as he\u2019d expected, it didn\u2019t contain anything useful. He went into the bathroom that connected the office to his bedroom and quickly showered, shaved and threw on a change of clothes, then walked out to the living room.</p><p>Leslie didn\u2019t notice him at first. She had moved to the chair and was looking animatedly at the sofa. If he hadn\u2019t known it was empty, he would have sworn she was deep in conversation with someone sitting there.</p><p>\u201cLeslie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Startled, she turned toward him.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Puzzled, he pressed on. \u201cWas...someone here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. I\u2019d never let anyone into your house.\u201d</p><p>He took a seat on the sofa, directly opposite her. She wasn\u2019t sitting back in the chair but was perched on the edge, the way she would have been if she\u2019d been talking to someone sitting exactly where he was now. He reached for her hands. \u201cLeslie...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said very softly, then pulled one hand away and touched his cheek. He felt his heart flutter. She was close. Her scent was alluring. The light in her eyes was enchanting. The dip of her scoop-neck knit dress was arousing.</p><p>And she was Matt\u2019s woman.</p><p>But Matt was dead.</p><p>And she was touching him.</p><p>He caught her hand. It was a delicate hand, with long, elegant fingers, clean and soft despite the fact that she spent her days digging in old earth. He held her palm against his face, feeling the thunder of both his heart and his libido.</p><p>It would be easy, so easy, to draw her to him, hold her close. Kiss her lips, feel the silk of her tongue. Touch her. Know her naked flesh. He\u2019d known his share of women over the years. If Nancy had lived, he would have stayed in love all his life, he thought. But she hadn\u2019t. There had been times after that when he would meet a woman, and he wouldn\u2019t really want to know her name, but he would learn it, anyway, just for the sake of decency. Then there had been the years when he hadn\u2019t been quite as much of an asshole, but there had never\u2014until now\u2014been a time when he had wanted someone the way he was discovering he wanted Leslie, wanted her with every carnal impulse he possessed, with a longing to know not just her face but her soul, the way she thought and everything she felt....</p><p>He inhaled. She was close, and coming closer. Her fingers moved over his cheek.</p><p>He threaded his own fingers through her hair as they leaned closer, both of them perched on the edge of their seats. His lips touched hers. They were soft, pliant and molding. Her mouth was sweet fire. She knew how to kiss, how to move her lips, teeth...tongue. Hot, wet, closer...it was the kind of kiss that set the blood to raging, filling the mind with visions of each step that should follow.</p><p>And then...</p><p>They broke apart. Moved back. He didn\u2019t know which of them had realized first that they were going too fast.</p><p>She began to apologize. \u201cI...wow, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m not ready\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m sorry. I look too much like Matt. But I\u2019m not Matt. I\u2019m Joe. And I want...but not...not until you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>She rose abruptly, walking to the media cabinet. \u201cWhat if...what if I\u2019m never ready?\u201d she whispered, and the words sounded so pained that he rose and, fighting every sexual instinct within himself, set his hands on her shoulders and drew her against him.</p><p>\u201cYou will be,\u201d he told her. \u201cYou will be. Although maybe it won\u2019t be with me.\u201d Hell, it had better be with him. He wasn\u2019t half as decent as he was trying to pretend, he thought, mocking himself. \u201cTime...well, time has to pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen widows start dating again in less than a year,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He pulled her more tightly against him. \u201cTime and pain don\u2019t seem to pay much attention to the calendar,\u201d he told her. \u201cYou\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>She turned into him, leaning her head against his chest. He smelled the clean fragrance of her hair, felt it tease him. He prayed that she would move away.</p><p>She did.</p><p>She took a step back and looked at him. The tension in the air was palpable. She looked alarmed.</p><p>\u201cHey...\u201d He lifted his hands.</p><p>\u201cYou...you\u2019re amazing, Joe,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>No, I\u2019m a rat. And I know the only way I\u2019ll ever get to be close to you is to keep my distance. Wait. Bide my time. Pray.</p><p>\u201cLeslie, it\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>They stared at each other for a moment longer. Then she cleared her throat and did her best to speak normally as she changed the subject. \u201cDid you know that your house was once owned by a very talented composer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...no.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cHis name was Zachary Duff. He had a few pieces published and performed before he was called up to fight in the Civil War.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd just how do you happen to know this?\u201d he asked. \u201cI mean,\u201d he joked, \u201cthe Civil War. That was a long time ago. He\u2019s not still hanging around, is he?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cWell, you know, music lives forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously, where did you get your information? I\u2019ve seen some of the records on this place...in fact, I think I remember seeing the name Duff. But in the late 1800s, the property was owned by a family named Norman. Duff must not have had children. Was he killed in the war?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe survived long enough to come home, then died from complications due to his injuries,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIs he haunting the house?\u201d Matt teased.</p><p>She didn\u2019t smile.</p><p>His laughter faded, and he frowned.</p><p>\u201cLeslie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheck out the bricks by the fireplace in your basement,\u201d she said. \u201cThe left outside wall. Pull a few of them out, and you\u2019ll find a cache of his work. It would be great if you could get it to a music publisher.\u201d</p><p>He laughed then. \u201cYou are joking, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m serious. And I\u2019m asking you to do this for me, as a special favor. Take the bricks out on the left side of the fireplace. You\u2019ll find you\u2019ve been in possession of a treasure trove of old American music.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you get this information? Seriously.\u201d</p><p>She pretended not to hear him, slipping past him, heading toward the door.</p><p>\u201cLeslie.\u201d</p><p>He caught up with her, set his hands on her shoulders and spun her around to face him. Her expression was guileless.</p><p>\u201cLeslie,\u201d he said very seriously, \u201cyou don\u2019t really believe in ghosts, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spend a lot of time in libraries,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know...we do tons of research on an area before we work it. A lot of Lower Manhattan\u2014and some areas of Brooklyn, too\u2014is a treasure trove, once you dig deep enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you just happened to research my house, and you know there\u2019s music stashed in a niche inside the bricks of my basement fireplace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cLeslie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel an urge for something stiff and fortifying before tonight. Let\u2019s head out, shall we?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He had \u201cfortifying\u201d right there, in the apartment.</p><p>But they needed to get out. Being alone was...</p><p>Painful.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>As he followed her out, locking up, he said, \u201cResearch, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheck out your basement fireplace,\u201d she said.</p><p>Hastings House. His prison.</p><p>But she was all right; Leslie was all right. He had seen her...almost touched her. She had called out to him, and he had tried so hard to reply. Then she\u2019d gone, and he\u2019d known that she was all right, but he was still so... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Afraid.</p><p>It was laughable.</p><p>He was just the ghost of a man.

Dreams filled with whispers and reminiscences. Poignant and sweet and surreal.</p><p>If he couldn\u2019t manage to summon enough of himself to be seen, to linger for more than a few seconds, to leave the confines of the house, how was it that he could pace\u2014or seem to\u2014endlessly and desperately?</p><p>Peace, rest in peace...</p><p>He couldn\u2019t. There was a reason for this pain of simultaneously being and not being, of needing to remain. It was fear. Fear for her. Strange warnings plagued his spectral soul. Somehow he knew she was in danger. He raged against it. What good did it do to feel this certainty that he should warn her, that the evil behind his death was still out there, when he was powerless to do anything about it? What had he ever done to deserve this wretched hell where he learned with more certainty each day that the greatest agony on earth didn\u2019t lie in the pain of living or the pain of death, but in the pain of separation that haunted the heart and soul?</p><p>It seemed, as he paced, that everything always came back to this room. The servants\u2019 pantry where he had died.</p> <p>The dead room.</p><p>So often he stood here, reliving those last moments. Hearing the hum of a voice, trying to pretend he was paying attention, looking over others\u2019 heads and seeing her eyes. It had been a great party, swimming with all the right people, with money, power and politics. The perfect evening...</p><p>And then the very air had exploded....</p><p>But she had been all right. Leslie had been all right....</p><p>He found himself in the main kitchen.</p><p>Hastings House was closing down for the day. The tourists were gone. Jeff Green was there, doffing his wig, looking around, making sure Melissa was nowhere to be seen. He lit up a cigarette, inhaled deeply, still keeping an eye out. From his pocket, he drew a flask and took a long swig.</p> <p>The cigarette suddenly flew from his hand. Jeff stared at the flask, then at the cigarette. He stared around the room, then, in a panic, swooped down to pick up the cigarette. He put it out at the sink, still looking around, and then he fled. Matt could hear the front door slam behind him.</p><p>And there she was. The Colonial woman who was always cooking over the fire. She smiled at him.</p><p>He smiled back.</p><p>\u201cI was betrayed,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI know, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey never knew. They said I walked away. That I left everything...but I didn\u2019t. He killed me. Shot me in the back. And they never knew. They never knew.\u201d Her face contorted. \u201cHow could they believe I would have left my child?\u201d She looked hopelessly at him. \u201cHe bricked up my body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was working here in the kitchen, cooking. He was weary of me, you see, in love with another. My dowry made him rich, but he never really loved me. He killed me as I stood here, with a single shot. And then he told everyone I had left him, run away with another man. His mistress came to live here then, but she was not happy, either. He had betrayed me, and soon enough he betrayed her. But she caught the consumption. She died, but at least before she did she passed it to him, and he died, as well, choking on his own blood. But it was too late. It didn\u2019t change what he did to me, what he told everyone I did. I saw it all, and yet...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYet you remain here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...because I don\u2019t know how to clear my name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did he hide your body?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe basement. Beneath the pantry. The butler helped him. So I must stay.\u201d</p><p>She turned away from him.</p><p>Once again she began to work over the hearth. And then she began to fade, until she finally disappeared.</p><p>Just like the missing prostitutes, this woman had vanished two hundred years ago. Women continued to vanish. Life didn\u2019t change. Men didn\u2019t change. Cruelty could not be halted by time.</p><p>And now the danger was threatening Leslie. He knew it. Had it been his own determination to write about the disappearances, to make the public aware, that had led to his death? And now Joe was searching for a missing woman, and he and Leslie were determined to find the truth behind the explosion. Was that what was putting her into danger, too?</p><p>So many sins could be hidden and buried.</p><p>He found himself drawn to the dead room and simply stood there, wondering why. Why he had died there.</p><p>He found himself thinking about the secret door beneath the braided rug that led to the basement and the bones that lay bricked up down there.</p><p>He felt the impotent rage of his helplessness, and wondered if this was hell. The powerlessness, the watching...the fear.</p><p>He decided suddenly that if he couldn\u2019t help himself, at least maybe he could help the woman in the kitchen. For that, at least, there was a way.</p><p>As to Leslie...</p><p>How he loved her. But he had to let go, had to let her live. Perhaps he needed the answers in order to let go, in order to let her live. Maybe he was trapped here so he could protect her, and yet...</p><p>How?</p><p>10</p><p>T here was glass and chrome everywhere. Leslie, though she loved old buildings, was thrilled to be in an atmosphere of the completely new.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t surprised to see Brad there, nor to see that he was in the company of Ken Dryer\u2014out of uniform\u2014and that they were engaged in conversation at the bar with a number of extremely attractive women. They didn\u2019t see her enter with Joe, and she was glad though not surprised, since the place was crowded, having recently been listed as one of Downtown\u2019s newest hot spots.</p><p>Joe looked amused as he caught her arm and whispered, \u201cYou\u2019re sure you want to be here?\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s good to shake things up once in a while. It\u2019s like...well, you know. You get too involved in what you\u2019re doing and you can\u2019t see the forest for the trees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point. I guess.\u201d</p><p>They made their way to the back of the bar. There was one bar stool; Joe let her sit and stood by her side. \u201cWhat will it be? Sparkling soda?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo good beers on tap here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou were conked on the head today, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the doctor said I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly. The doctor said you were conked on the head,\u201d he corrected.</p><p>She liked his smile so much. Of course she did. It reminded her of Matt\u2019s.</p><p>They both had the same way about them. A bit rueful, as if they had learned early on not to take themselves too seriously. Not that they couldn\u2019t be serious, because they could. They both cared about the world around them, both had a quiet strength that demanded respect. But there was one crucial difference.</p><p>Matt was dead.</p><p>And it was wrong for her to spend her time comparing Joe to him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat about what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re smiling.\u201d</p><p>She took a breath, decided to be honest. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014there are just a lot of things about you that remind me so much of Matt.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t seem offended. \u201cGranny Rose,\u201d he said seriously.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cOur grandmother. She was four foot eleven, in a stretch. A good eighty pounds. She was the toughest\u2014and sweetest\u2014old bird I ever knew. She landed here, married Granddad, had her kids. Her respect for America was enormous, but her tales of the old country were full of her love for the place. She was as Catholic as the day was long, but in her own way. She loathed people who went to church every Sunday, then turned around and behaved badly. The true measure of a man, she\u2019d always say, was the way he dealt with his fellow man. Of course, she was also fond of saying, \u2018Don\u2019t pee on me head and tell me it\u2019s raining.\u2019 She was quite an influence on us when we were boys. Our parents all worked, so we were with her a lot during our formative years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt mentioned her a few times. I wish I\u2019d gotten to meet her.\u201d</p><p>The bartender came at last, staring at them with a superior look. Joe glanced at her, arched a brow, then asked the man, \u201cAny beer?\u201d</p><p>The bartender looked at them as if they were utterly lacking in taste, but he shrugged and said that they carried one bottled beer. It was a new European brand, but Joe shrugged in return and ordered two. They arrived promptly.</p><p>Joe took a swallow, studying her. She looked back at him. \u201cCould you meet her\u2014if you wanted to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeet who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy grandmother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t get a chance to answer, didn\u2019t even know if he\u2019d been mocking her or if his question had been serious, because just then Brad spotted them.</p><p>\u201cLeslie!\u201d he called, walking over. \u201cUh...Joe,\u201d he added, with noticeably less enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cHey, Brad,\u201d she said. Joe acknowledged him with a nod that matched Brad\u2019s lack of enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cCool. You decided to check the place out,\u201d Brad said, then frowned at her. \u201cLeslie, did you see a doctor? Are you all right? Should you be drinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine\u2014I\u2019m only having the one beer\u2014but thanks for asking. And I can see why you like this place,\u201d she told him, smiling and indicating the bevy of very attractive women around the spot at the bar where Ken Dryer was still chatting. \u201cIt\u2019s a good pickup spot. You and Ken should do well. You\u2019re both gorgeous,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>Brad winked at Joe. \u201cYou can almost believe she thinks so.\u201d He grinned. \u201cDryer has been at the site a lot, and I thought he deserved a break. You know Laymon. He thinks the world lives to steal whatever it is he\u2019s looking for. He\u2019s bugging the cops constantly. He wants them to put out regular announcements that the police presence at the site is heavy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to find buried treasure. It was a very poor area,\u201d Leslie said. She couldn\u2019t help glancing over toward Dryer. The guy was perfect at his job. Suddenly, though, noticing one of the girls, a tall redhead in a very short skirt, sporting a white fur mini-stole, she had an uncomfortable feeling. High-priced call girl? If so, did she know she was flirting with a police officer? Silly, she told herself, thinking anyone dressed that way had to be hooking. Half the women in town dressed like hookers and weren\u2019t. Since this one had it, she was certainly entitled to flaunt it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Joe leaned in, resting an elbow on the bar. \u201cCollectibles are big these days,\u201d he said, drawing Leslie\u2019s attention back to the conversation. \u201cThat includes artifacts that might not have been worth much when they were new but are antiques now,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>Brad grimaced. \u201cI still don\u2019t see the criminals of New York suddenly deciding to loot an archaeological dig. But, hey, Laymon lives for nothing but his work and probably thinks everyone else lives for it, too. Scary. If I ever start turning into him, hit me, Leslie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see it happening,\u201d she assured him. Then she frowned as a flash suddenly went off in her face and turned to see what was going on.</p> <p>\u201cHey!\u201d Brad protested.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d the offending photographer said with complete insincerity. He looked young, maybe twenty-two, with slightly shaggy brown hair, a clean-shaven face and brown eyes. He was dressed attractively enough in casual slacks and a tweed jacket, but he wasn\u2019t quite up to the designer labels most people in the room were sporting. He grinned and turned to hurry out\u2014only to be met by a couple of burly doormen.</p><p>\u201cHey, buddy, no hassling the customers,\u201d one of them said firmly.</p><p>\u201cBut the world wants to know,\u201d the photographer protested.</p><p>\u201cOut!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe world wants to know,\u201d Joe repeated. To Leslie\u2019s surprise, he pushed away from the bar, heading after the receding bouncers and the photographer.</p><p>Brad stared at her blankly. \u201cWhat the hell is he doing? What was that all about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess we\u2019re the most important noncelebrities in the place, and he\u2019s from one of the tabloids,\u201d Leslie said.</p><p>\u201cI got that much,\u201d Brad said. \u201cBut what got Joe going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not going to wrestle the camera away and steal the film, is he?\u201d Brad said worriedly.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d She smiled. Brad never tired of having his picture in the papers.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should go out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s all right. Do you know what I think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you should head back to your position at the bar or Ken is going to steal the lady of your choice.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, then laughed. \u201cYou know, you could be the love of my life. And then I wouldn\u2019t have to barhop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrad, I don\u2019t think anyone is going to be the love of your life, or at least not for a very long time, and you wouldn\u2019t want to ruin a great partnership, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m ready to settle down.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike hell.\u201d</p><p>He grinned, then sobered, saying seriously, \u201cDon\u2019t go falling head over heels just because...well, because you\u2019re trying to turn this guy into Matt. I mean, he seems fine. Dryer says he\u2019s really respected, that people are willing to fly him all over the world for help, it\u2019s just that...he isn\u2019t Matt, and you can\u2019t turn him into Matt. I just hope you\u2019re not setting yourself up for...well, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m saying. I care about you, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. I care about you, too, and I\u2019ll be all right. Really. And you don\u2019t have to hang around until he comes back. I\u2019m a big girl. I\u2019m okay at a bar by myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to desert you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides, I want to know what he\u2019s doing out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAha! The truth is out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, there are wolves in this place. I really don\u2019t think I should leave you alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrad, you are one of the wolves in this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but not to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. So how was work? Anything new?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, workmen shoring up the walls. Only guys Laymon approves of, and even then he spent half his day on top of them, driving them nuts.\u201d</p><p>Leslie grinned. Maybe it was a good thing she\u2019d taken the day off. She looked toward the door, wondering herself just what had gotten into Joe.</p><p>The bouncers didn\u2019t take the camera, but when it looked like they were going to get a little rough, Joe stepped in.</p><p>\u201cHey, guys...you got rid of him. Let it go now.\u201d</p><p>The bouncers turned around. \u201cJust trying to protect you and your lady friend, buddy,\u201d one of them said.</p><p>\u201cAnd I appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>The kid stared at him, backing away. \u201cAre you going to take my camera?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Joe shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m free to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Let\u2019s take a little walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDown a dark alley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019re from The World Wants to Know, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d the photographer said carefully.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Phil Brynner, aren\u2019t you?\u201d When the kid looked at him warily, he added, \u201cI saw your picture next to your byline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...what do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo ask you a few questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour article on Genevieve O\u2019Brien.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d His brown eyes widened. \u201cI...uh...who are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name is Connolly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you a cop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, a private investigator. I\u2019d just like to know what you know about the scandal surrounding Genevieve\u2019s birth.\u201d</p><p>The kid still looked distrustful, but he wasn\u2019t ready to bolt anymore, and he wasn\u2019t cringing. \u201cI never met her, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re aware she\u2019s missing, though, right?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, looking a little ill. \u201cYou can\u2019t blame me for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly what were you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t right out there, huh? It made you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to play twenty questions with you,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>Phil swallowed. \u201cI went through a bunch of records. Public records,\u201d he said defensively. \u201cI sifted through gossip columns and all kinds of stuff\u2014I worked really hard on that, and it was a good article.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a masterpiece,\u201d Joe said wearily. \u201cI want to know what you were saying. Genevieve couldn\u2019t have been another man\u2019s child. Have you seen her aunt\u2019s face? She\u2019s the spitting image of the woman, an O\u2019Brien through and through.\u201d</p><p>Phil stared at him, then grinned broadly. \u201cThat\u2019s just it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEileen Brideswell isn\u2019t Genevieve\u2019s aunt.\u201d He stared triumphantly at Joe. \u201cShe\u2019s her mother.\u201d</p><p>Joe could feel his eyes widen in surprise.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Phil said, \u201cI found hospital records. I don\u2019t actually have proof per se, but that\u2019s why I danced around it. Eileen Brideswell wasn\u2019t married back then. Her upcoming engagement party was the talk of the city. I went through a million pictures, too. O\u2019Brien\u2019s wife didn\u2019t look pregnant, then all of a sudden she looked like she had a pillow under her blouse. Eileen Brideswell was supposedly in New England when Genevieve was born, but I couldn\u2019t find a single piece of proof that she was actually there. And then all of a sudden she was home. And the O\u2019Briens were all happy with their baby daughter and Eileen went on to marry a very rich man. You can come by and see my research, if you want. I\u2019m in Midtown.\u201d</p><p>Joe accepted the card the kid produced, then handed over one of his own.</p><p>\u201cThis can\u2019t have anything to do with the fact that she\u2019s...missing,\u201d Phil said, but though he clearly meant it to be a statement, it came out as a question. A hopeful one.</p><p>\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t think so. But...who knows?\u201d</p><p>The kid hesitated again. \u201cDo you care if I print the picture? I won\u2019t write anything horrible about you and your friends, honestly. I just saw Miss MacIntyre at the table, and she\u2019s been on television lately, so I took the shot. I\u2019ll just say she had a nice night out with friends, including her partner and her deceased fianc\u00e9\u2019s...brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCousin,\u201d Joe said flatly.</p><p>\u201cNothing bad, honest,\u201d Phil insisted. \u201cHey, do you think I\u2019d be working where I am if I didn\u2019t have to get experience somewhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrint it. But I\u2019d better like it. Let me put it this way\u2014you\u2019d better not say anything negative about Leslie MacIntyre, Brad or me\u2014or Matt. I mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe still have freedom of the press, you know,\u201d Phil muttered a little resentfully. \u201cSorry, just kidding, I swear. I\u2019m not out to hurt people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly. Come on, I have to write something titillating now and then. And I\u2019d seen Genevieve O\u2019Brien on the news, talking about society\u2019s lack of concern for the down and out. There she was, a socialite, gorgeous, and she was so passionate about working with the poor. Next thing I knew, I was delving into her past and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you ever overseas?\u201d Joe cut in irritably.</p><p>\u201cWell...I was over in Staten Island. Sounds better to say overseas. Sounds far more exciting\u2014and it is over water.\u201d</p><p>Joe shook his head in disgust, angry with himself for not having forced the issue with the man\u2019s rag magazine office. \u201cAll right,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAll right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know where to find me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet.\u201d</p><p>Phil grinned, then cradled his camera to his chest and started at a leisurely pace down the street. A few seconds later, he started running.</p><p>Joe watched him go, then reentered the bar.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Leslie said, when they\u2019d left the bar. \u201cSpill the details.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d explained to her and Brad that he had seen an article the kid had written that interested him and assured Brad that his picture would make the paper, but he hadn\u2019t explained any further. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They\u2019d wound up eating supper with Brad and Ken, though she\u2019d been surprised when Ken had come by to suggest it, having figured he was having fun at the bar and would probably be going home with one of the women surrounding him.

She wasn\u2019t sure exactly what that meant, but she was glad she\u2019d never fallen for the man. Not that there was anything really bad about him, but no way was she going to stand for being someone\u2019s secret.</p><p>She was glad when they spent the dinner arguing about the next election\u2014something different, for a change, she thought. Then Ken had talked about a new costume exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and she found herself fascinated and anxious to see it. Then, at last, they left, ostensibly heading home.</p><p>\u201cDetails?\u201d Joe asked her as he showed her into his car. \u201cThere are no details.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHave it your way,\u201d she said, not seeing any point in trying to force him to talk if he didn\u2019t want to. \u201cSo we\u2019re going to see your prostitute, right?\u201d</p><p>His brow furrowed. \u201cShe\u2019s not my prostitute,\u201d he said lightly.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t mean it that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ll like her. There\u2019s something about her...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I have no intention of judging her,\u201d Leslie said.</p> <p>They drove slowly along the street.</p><p>\u201cThere she is,\u201d Joe said. \u201cI\u2019m going to park.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me out first, will you? I want to get a feel for the street.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her gravely. \u201cDon\u2019t get into any trouble. I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat trouble can I get into?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He pulled over to the curb and she hopped out. She looked up and down the street. They were very near Hastings House. In fact, she could see the subway station she would have used if she\u2019d needed to.</p> <p>She was surprised by the number of women working the area. She never would have suspected it. By day, this was a business area. There were only a few hotels, and those median-range\u2014business range\u2014in price. Maybe not such a bad place to turn tricks after all, now that she thought about it.</p><p>She didn\u2019t look for Didi Dancer. She just stood on the street and closed her eyes, trying to get a feel for something.</p><p>\u201cHoney, are you all right?\u201d</p><p>She looked up at the tall woman in the very short skirt who had stopped to talk to her. Definitely dressed for business.</p><p>\u201cFine, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were going to pass out there, for a minute. Well, if you\u2019re all right...\u201d She hesitated, then shook her head. \u201cHoney, you look as innocent as a lamb. Are you lost? You really shouldn\u2019t be out here alone at night. I mean...crime is down big time in the City, but still...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you Didi Dancer?\u201d Leslie asked.</p><p>The woman stepped back, looking suspicious.</p> <p>Just then Joe got out of the car and started walking in their direction. Didi took another step back.</p><p>\u201cDidi,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>She just waited, keeping her distance, a frown furrowing her features.</p><p>Joe reached them. \u201cI got you that job interview,\u201d he reminded her softly.</p><p>Didi looked at him. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not till next week. Gotta eat till then,\u201d she murmured. \u201cThis the girlfriend? Looking for a three-way or something?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>Leslie had the feeling the woman was just trying to be harsh. \u201cI\u2019m trying to help Joe find the women who\u2019ve disappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you\u2019re trying to find the rich girl,\u201d Didi said.</p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s the matter, Didi?\u201d Joe asked. \u201cYou said you wanted to help.\u201d</p><p>Didi let out a sigh, but her eyes were still suspicious when she looked at Leslie. \u201cThere\u2019s something about her....\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cWill you show me where the car was\u2014the dark sedan\u2014when Genevieve O\u2019Brien got into it? Please?\u201d Leslie said.</p><p>\u201cRight there.\u201d Didi pointed ten feet down the block. \u201cI remember because of the fire hydrant. I knew when the guy pulled over that any idiot would know not to even pretend to park there.\u201d</p><p>Leslie walked over to the spot as Didi and Joe just watched her.</p><p>At first she felt nothing but the night air, heard nothing but the normal sounds of the city.</p><p>A cat meowed.</p><p>A dog barked.</p><p>A car backfired, and a horn blared.</p><p>Rap music shook the pavement as someone drove by with the radio cranked up.</p><p>What am I doing? she asked herself. It\u2019s not like I have ESP.</p><p>But she closed her eyes anyway, saw the picture of Genevieve O\u2019Brien in her mind\u2019s eye.</p><p>The sounds of night faded. She imagined the street as it must have been that night. She could see Genevieve, passionate, urgent, trying to convince Didi that she had to get out of this life and help herself. And then...</p><p>She heard the car horn.</p><p>Genevieve turned....</p><p>And recognized the person in the car.</p><p>Not a friend!</p><p>That sensation swept through Leslie fiercely. Not a friend, but still someone she knew. Someone who bugged her, who compounded the headaches of the system, who didn\u2019t care about the work that needed to be done.</p><p>Genevieve was irritated as she walked over to the car.</p><p>Leslie could almost hear the man\u2019s voice.</p><p>Get in and we\u2019ll talk about it. I\u2019ll even give you a ride home.</p><p>So Genevieve got in. She had no inkling of danger.</p><p>Not until they had been driving for several minutes. Then, with one hand on the wheel, he had turned to her while she was talking about the issue and snapped something with his free hand. She frowned, still not alarmed, until he pressed his hand over her mouth and a sickeningly sweet smell filled her nostrils....</p><p>No! She struggled, tried to fight, tried to push away his hand. He was still driving, and there were people around, if she could just scream, fight, bang on the window....</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t. She was losing consciousness. And she knew...</p><p>\u201cLeslie!\u201d</p><p>Leslie heard her own name and the spell was broken. The feelings, the vision, faded away.</p><p>The next thing she knew, Joe\u2019s arms were around her as she realized she had been about to crash to the pavement.</p><p>\u201cI knew there was more to that bump on the head,\u201d he announced. \u201cI\u2019m getting you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. Please,\u201d she protested, somehow finding the strength to stand. \u201cMy head is fine.\u201d</p><p>What on earth had just happened? She\u2019d never experienced anything like that before. And she\u2019d thought talking to ghosts was weird?</p><p>Didi was staring at her as if she were an alien.</p><p>Leslie gave her what she hoped was a reassuring smile. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou a psychic or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Leslie demurred, but the woman was still staring at her, as was Joe. \u201cWell, kind of,\u201d she admitted uneasily. \u201cSometimes I get...sensations. You know, when someone is...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDead?\u201d Didi asked flatly.</p><p>Leslie shrugged. \u201cI...I hope not. Genevieve did know whoever picked her up,\u201d she said with conviction, looking at Joe.</p><p>Didi sniffed. \u201cI could have told you that. He had to be a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s just it. He was someone she knew, but not a friend. Someone she did business with, worked with somehow. She was annoyed when she saw him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe got right into the car,\u201d Didi said.</p><p>\u201cRight\u2014because she knew him. Because even though she didn\u2019t like him, he was respectable, someone people trusted, but she wanted something from him that she wasn\u2019t getting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t that life,\u201d Didi murmured.</p><p>\u201cAny chance you can tell where they went?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>Leslie hesitated, then shook her head. \u201cAll I know is that they drove for a while before he drugged her. That\u2019s what he did, he drugged her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrugged her or killed her?\u201d Joe asked quietly.</p><p>Leslie frowned then. \u201cI...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Joe asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cListen, I\u2019m not a psychic. I really\u2014\u201d She broke off. No way was she ready to explain that her real talent lay in talking to ghosts.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you going to say?\u201d Joe demanded.</p><p>Leslie stared at him, letting out a long sigh. \u201cI...don\u2019t think she\u2019s dead. She was abducted, she was drugged...but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>Joe stared back at her. He didn\u2019t seem to doubt her, didn\u2019t question her. He looked thoughtful.</p><p>\u201cI mean...I don\u2019t know anything,\u201d she said. \u201cI just...I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t help but think I would have...felt it if she\u2019d died. I think she might be alive.\u201d</p><p>Joe folded his arms over his chest. \u201cThen it\u2019s imperative that we find her. Quickly.\u201d</p><p>11</p><p>I am with you. All is well....</p><p>Leslie didn\u2019t fall asleep easily that night, despite her desire to dream. She lay awake for hours, certain that the answer was there, but seeing it was like finding the proverbial needle in a haystack, the haystack being New York with its millions of denizens, and the needle being a single woman who was there somewhere.</p><p>So she had lain awake with the television on, keeping her company. Joe had somehow been loathe to leave her, despite the alarm system, and though she had absolutely insisted that he go home, she had the feeling he was sleeping in his car again. She should have suggested that he at least sleep in one of the other bedrooms, but she hadn\u2019t been able to bring herself to make the offer.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t afraid of her dreams. Quite the opposite: she welcomed them. She argued with herself that she had to be alone, that Matt was trying to reach her, and the presence of any other human being might keep him away.</p><p>That was true.</p><p>But equally true was the fact that she couldn\u2019t let go. Not yet...</p><p>And then, when she finally slept, he was there. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>First, the tenderness.</p><p>The sensation that she wasn\u2019t alone, that the past hadn\u2019t been lost to tragedy, that what should have been forever hadn\u2019t been ripped away from her. The sweetness of lying down on a soft mattress after a long day, of being held, the comfort of another human being, loved and cherished, at her side. Then...</p><p>Flesh against flesh. The feathery brush of his lips on hers, the weight of him on top of her. Light, teasing kisses that quickly filled with passion. Blankets tossed and discarded. The slide of cotton against her body as the nightgown was tossed aside. The whisper of his breath against her skin, moving from the valley between her breasts, over her abdomen and down to her thighs.</p> <p>I knew you would come, she said.</p><p>And his very simple answer.</p><p>I love you so much...</p><p>In her dreams she stroked his flesh, was seduced and aroused by the fire of his lips and tongue moving intimately and along the length of her. She looked into his eyes, blue like the sky. She saw his smile, the single dimple in his cheek. Caressed his jaw, hard and squared, almost as if it had been formed by the determination and sense of justice with which he had lived his life, rather than the lottery of genetics. She reached out and, with both hands, she cupped his face and drew his mouth to hers again. She initiated the ferocity of the kiss, so rapt herself that she needed to return each stroke and caress, needed to seduce as she was seduced, needed to tease and arouse.</p><p>She stroked the muscles of his shoulders and then, with the whisper-light touch of her fingertips, caressed the length of his chest to the quickening muscles of his belly. In a fever she followed that touch with taunting kisses, pushing him back, straddling him, looking down at him until, smiling, she bent, her hair wickedly teasing his flesh as she played and stroked, lower and lower. At last his hoarse cry sounded, and she herself writhed and twisted and arced, desperate and hungry, almost wild, savagely in need of him, body and soul. Sensation coursed through her, and despite the volatile thunder and erotic friction of their lovemaking, beneath it flowed a subtle tenderness, a swell of emotion that elevated what was so simply human and physical and made of it something so much more.</p> <p>She found herself beneath him, her breath frenzied, her heart in an uproar, and she lost the sense of being in her own body as he moved within her. All the while, his kisses fell on her breasts, her shoulders and then her lips. At last, locked to him by the joining of their flesh, she was rocked by the explosion of climax. Her limbs locked around him as she reveled in the cocoon of his embrace. Wonder filled her as she drifted back to earth, trembling in the aftermath of passion, her hot skin cooling, bathed in a fine sheen of sweat. He was damp at her side, their hair slick and tangled together on the pillow, and she marveled at how incredible it was to be so loved, so happy.</p><p>In dreams.</p><p>Because she knew she was dreaming, but she would not let the dream go. She entwined her fingers with his as she lay spooned against him, his hand resting on her belly. She felt the muscles of his chest where she rested her head.</p><p>This closeness was so familiar; they lay together just as they had so often when he\u2019d come home late and slipped into bed. First had come lovemaking, then a few lazy words about the day, or their plans for the future.</p><p>I\u2019m afraid for you, he whispered now.</p><p>Afraid for me? Matt, you were a reporter. You know what it feels like to see something wrong and feel obligated to set it right, and you know I have to discover the truth about what happened here.</p> <p>He listened, considered her words, carefully formed his own answer before whispering it into the lush silk of the hair against her ear.</p><p>Yes, I know that, but I can\u2019t help it\u2014I\u2019m afraid for you. He was silent for a minute, almost as if it were painful to continue. I can\u2019t be with you. Trust Joe.</p><p>She started to tell him that she was constantly surrounded by people\u2014including cops\u2014so how could she be in danger, but then she stopped as she remembered the dig. As the day had passed, she\u2019d convinced herself that the roof had caved in on her, but was that true? She had been focused on the niche in the wall where the record book had been, but she\u2019d been sure she\u2019d heard...something. Sensed...something. But she was certain no one else had entered after her, and she was sure no one had already been there when she came in. So...</p><p>I felt it this morning, a sense of fear for you, but there was nothing I could do. But Joe was here, and it was all right. Don\u2019t trust anyone else, do you hear me? Only Joe.</p><p>All right, she said slowly. But why?</p><p>\u201cThe basement.\u201d</p><p>Leslie woke with a start, certain someone had spoken the words aloud. She bolted up to a sitting position, the covers clutched to her chest. Her hair was a tangled, damp mess. Sometime in the night she had torn off her nightgown, and the sheets were hopelessly rumpled.</p><p>She groaned, feeling almost as if she had a hangover. She touched the top of her head, but the lump was almost gone.</p> <p>\u201cThe basement?\u201d she said aloud.</p><p>If she\u2019d expected a reply, she didn\u2019t get one.</p><p>She rose and showered, then dressed in a T-shirt and khakis with a half-dozen pockets, three on each leg, and hurried downstairs. She was still early enough to have the place to herself. She put the coffee on, then went through to the servants\u2019 pantry.</p><p>She pulled back the braided rug and found the trapdoor leading to the basement beneath. She\u2019d been in the basement before, of course, long before the night of the gala. They\u2019d hoped to find all kinds of treasures down there, especially because the simple cellar had changed very little since the house\u2019s early days, but in the end it wasn\u2019t a treasure trove as some basements and attics could be. Over the years, the owners of the house had cleaned out their own belongings, along with anything that had come before.</p><p>Now the hole in the floor gaped wide and dark, like the entrance to an abyss.</p><p>She left the trapdoor open and went back to the kitchen. The coffee was ready, so she poured herself a cup and sipped while rifling through the drawers, certain she would find a flashlight in one of them. Then she paused.</p><p>The spectral woman was back at the hearth, stirring her spectral pot. Finally she paused, turned and looked straight at Leslie.</p><p>\u201cHe wants you to help me,\u201d she said, a note of such poignant gratitude in her voice that empathy swept through Leslie with so much force that she nearly dropped her coffee cup.</p><p>\u201cI would love to help you. Who are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cElizabeth Martin. Please. I never left my child.\u201d</p><p>Leslie stared back at her, noting that she could see right through the woman\u2019s spectral body.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re...all gone now, you know.\u201d</p><p>The woman looked agitated. \u201cThey have to know the truth. I never left my baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElizabeth Martin,\u201d Leslie said. \u201cI\u2019ll do my very best.\u201d</p><p>The woman smiled. \u201cThe basement,\u201d she said.</p><p>Leslie did drop the cup then. It shattered on the floor just as Elizabeth Martin faded from view.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gone crazy, but am I going to stop her? Not in this lifetime,\u201d Melissa said.</p><p>Joe stared at her blankly. She\u2019d thrown open the door when he\u2019d rung the bell, and those were the first words out of her mouth at the sight of him.</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeslie. She\u2019s down in the basement with a pickax!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ask her why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe says that there\u2019s a body in the wall.\u201d</p><p>Joe frowned and hurried inside, along the hallway and straight to the back. When he entered the servants\u2019 pantry, he immediately shivered and realized he\u2019d entered the dead room, then wondered where that thought had come from.</p><p>The braided rug that usually covered the floor had been pulled away, and the trapdoor to the basement was open. He could see light from a work lantern rising up the stairs going down to the basement, strong wooden steps added recently to cover the dangerous brick stairway that had been there originally.</p><p>He hurried down.</p><p>The vertical line of fireplaces throughout the house was in evidence here, as well. A brick fireplace and hearth were set into one wall, and Leslie was standing to the left. She had apparently finished with the pickax and was digging away at the brick with her hands. She scared him a little. Her beautiful face was intent, her movements almost frantic.</p><p>\u201cLeslie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoe. Hey. Come help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeslie, what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...uh...found some old records. I think there\u2019s a body back here. Well, a skeleton, anyway. Come on.\u201d</p><p>He went to her side. One of the bricks was stuck. He had a Swiss Army knife in his pocket, so he pulled it out and chipped at the mortar to free the brick. She stepped back and took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you should be doing this?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeslie, this property is owned by the Historical Society.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf anyone is angry, I\u2019ll pay for repairs,\u201d she said. \u201cPlease, Joe?\u201d</p><p>The brick fell away in his hand. He stepped back, stunned. Even in the weak light and through the grime and dust of the ages, he could see bone.</p><p>Shit!</p><p>He almost swore aloud.</p><p>Leslie didn\u2019t look surprised in any way.</p><p>\u201cWell, there...all right. We can stop now. They\u2019re still shoring up the crypt at the site, I imagine. Laymon will be there, but Brad can come over and help me. Except,\u201d she said thoughtfully, \u201cI\u2019ll have to get into the crypt...no, St. Paul\u2019s has been there since 1766, and the crypt we just discovered wouldn\u2019t have been completed then. Hmm. I need to find more records. Maybe the library...Hey.\u201d She stared at him with a sudden smile. \u201cDid you check your basement wall yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I going to find bones, too?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI told you, you\u2019ll find music.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I guess I will,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better start looking for those records,\u201d she said, suddenly decisive. She walked over to him and gave him a fierce hug and big kiss on the cheek. \u201cDrop me off at the main library. I\u2019m going to start there.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said, and then he couldn\u2019t help himself: He yawned.</p><p>She frowned. \u201cYou didn\u2019t go home last night, did you? I bet you just made sure you had a clean shirt in the car.\u201d She smiled. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep worrying about me, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently, it\u2019s not a matter of can or can\u2019t. I simply do.\u201d</p> <p>She started toward the stairs, then turned around, her eyes carefully assessing the basement. It correlated in size exactly to the servants\u2019 pantry\u2014the dead room, he thought again\u2014above it.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cEverything is uneven down here, have you noticed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hundreds of years old. What would you expect?\u201d</p><p>She was still studying the walls. Then she shivered suddenly, hugging her arms around herself. \u201cThe subway runs near here, right?\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged. \u201cI guess. Probably much deeper, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. But still, there are all kinds of shafts and tunnels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant me to find an old subway map?\u201d he teased.</p><p>\u201cThat would be great,\u201d she told him, completely serious. \u201cOkay, I really have to get to work. What\u2019s your plan for the day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go back over the last-known movements of every prostitute who disappeared and see if I can find any connection to Genevieve O\u2019Brien,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a busy agenda. You\u2019ll still be able to find me some old maps?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou want maps? I\u2019ll get you maps,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>\u201cWill you drop me at the library?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. But you might want to shower and change again first. You\u2019re wearing a little too much brick dust to be fashionable.\u201d</p><p>She looked down at herself and laughed. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll hurry.\u201d</p><p>She was humming as she ran up the stairs.</p><p>Melissa and Tandy\u2014who was leading the tours that day\u2014were told about the discovery but sworn to secrecy. While Joe waited for Leslie, he found himself drawn to the main dining room, where Tandy was giving her speech to a group of college students from Columbia University.</p><p>\u201cImagine a very different place,\u201d she began. \u201cWhen the story of New York first began, the action was here, downtown. Times Square was a distant and savage land where the Algonquin-speaking natives still reigned. New York was first taken by the Dutch. The Dutch West India Company established a fur-trading post here in 1625. Peter Stuyvesant, the last Dutch colonial governor, was a tyrant. He closed the taverns at nine, for God\u2019s sake. When the English came in 1664, they easily ousted the Dutch without a fight and renamed the city\u2014which had been called New Amsterdam\u2014New York, after James, Duke of York, and brother of Charles II. We stand near the Five Points area of the Sixth Ward\u2014the area roughly bounded now by Broadway, Canal Street, the Bowery and Park Row. Disease and death were a hallmark of the poorer, more densely populated areas. People used ponds and waterways to dump refuse and sewage. And with poverty came violence and finally rebellion.</p><p>\u201cThis city is one of the places where liberty began, where battles were fought and riots surged. When you walk out the door, you\u2019ll see the vital, high-stakes city of today. But I hope that by the time you leave Hastings House, you\u2019ll also have a better understanding of the city beneath and all the sins buried by time.\u201d</p> <p>The city beneath.</p><p>Buried sins.</p><p>The words haunted Joe. How many people disappeared, simply vanished, as if they\u2019d never been? The rivers were too iffy\u2014sometimes bodies escaped whatever weights held them down and bobbed to the surface, and New York City wasn\u2019t an easy place to dig holes where they wouldn\u2019t be seen.</p><p>The city beneath.</p><p>But where to begin looking?</p><p>Leslie was grateful that her job allowed access to areas of the library where most people couldn\u2019t go, and that the records regarding Hastings House were in good order.</p><p>She waded through a lot of information on the many roles the house had played during the years, having been a school and an office building, among other things. So many facades and changes had been added over the years that the building\u2019s true contours had almost been forgotten. Only the threat of demolition ten years earlier had brought the true persona of the place to light. Additions, later ornamentation and other changes had been painstakingly researched and removed and the historic gem been brought back.</p><p>At last she reached the early history of the house. Built by a sea captain in the late 1700s, it had been left to his niece, Elizabeth, at his death.</p><p>Her heart quickened; she had never expected it to be this easy.</p><p>Elizabeth had married a merchant, Jacob Martin. Martin had remarried in 1803. The parish register commented that Elizabeth Martin, age twenty-one, was presumed dead. But there was also a notation left in the register by a priest who had not wanted to assume the task of remarrying Mr. Martin. \u201cJacob claimed earlier that his wife deserted him and their babe for Gordon Black, a sailor who often came to port but has not appeared since. In his haste to remarry, he has convinced the elders that Elizabeth must have perished on the journey, else she would have returned to take their babe, young Sarah. I fear that for a man to be so certain of his wife\u2019s death, he may have been witness to it. He appears, however, to be a pillar of our dear parish, and it is she, Elizabeth, who is scorned, dead or alive, by the men of character around us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor Elizabeth,\u201d she whispered, shaking her head sadly. She paused a minute, feeling as if her heart had suddenly become very heavy. Matt, were you with me? Did you try to tell me first? I can see Elizabeth, talk to her. Why can\u2019t I see you, talk to you?</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she murmured aloud. \u201cYou wanted me to help Elizabeth, and I swear I\u2019ll do my best. Please, though...let me help you. And myself.\u201d</p><p>She shut up. She was alone and talking to herself. Time to get back to work.</p><p>She\u2019d had access to all these records earlier. But at the time she\u2019d been looking for old delft plates, silver...other treasures left behind.</p><p>She went still suddenly. She was in a private section of the library; she was alone. But she\u2019d had the feeling of being watched. A creeping sensation teased the back of her neck. She looked up. It was the way she had felt in the crypt the other night. Not at all as if she were being stalked by a ghostly presence.</p><p>Ghosts were usually pale essences. They didn\u2019t want to hurt anyone; they wanted to be helped. Occasionally, they were bitter or liked to play pranks. Both Adam Harrison and Nikki Blackhawk had told her that they\u2019d never encountered a ghost that was actually vicious\u2014except against whoever had caused them to become a ghost.</p><p>She groaned softly, laying her head on her arms on the table. She could just see the conversation with a therapist. Am I paranoid? I don\u2019t think so. I\u2019m not afraid of the dark, and I\u2019m certainly not afraid of ghosts. Hell, some of my favorite people are ghosts. In fact, I may never date again. I have this spectacular ghost who comes to me at night...But the thing is, I feel like I\u2019m being stalked, but not by a ghost, by...evil.</p><p>She lifted her head, determined that she had far too much work ahead of her to fall prey to her imagination.</p><p>She dialed Brad\u2019s cell phone.</p><p>\u201cLeslie?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe library. Are the engineers still working at the site?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup. They think they\u2019ll finish around three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you meet me back at Hastings House? I\u2019ve got something exciting to show you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen? I\u2019ll need a little time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour o\u2019clock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. What did you find?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you.\u201d</p><p>First things first. Joe put in a call to Genevieve\u2019s old office and, after only a few minutes of exasperation, got through to the voice menu and then to Alice. Bless her. She\u2019d copied the files and agreed to meet him downstairs with them.</p><p>He took the files, giving her a big kiss on the cheek and promising her the best dinner the city of New York could offer. Flushed and pleased, she assured him it wasn\u2019t necessary but also that she would love it.</p><p>Then he hurried home. Time was of the essence\u2014he felt that keenly. But he still had to shower, shave, change and get organized.</p><p>But the shower could wait another few minutes.</p><p>In the basement, he impatiently took a pickax to his wall. Dumb\u2014it could have been done with much less damage\u2014but he didn\u2019t have time.</p><p>What was it with people choosing to wall up their treasures\u2014or their buried sins\u2014in the fireplace wall?</p><p>At first he found nothing. Great. He had destroyed half his basement on a whim. But on what he had determined would be his last stroke, he hit a hollow spot.</p><p>And there, behind the bricks, was a little shelf. On the shelf was a single Civil War-era tobacco tin.</p><p>And in the tin were sheets of handwritten music.</p><p>He stared at the tin and its contents for several minutes, disbelieving at first, then uneasy. He looked around the house. What? Was he suddenly going to start believing in ghosts?</p><p>Was it all logic and research, as Leslie sometimes claimed?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it to a music publisher,\u201d he said aloud. Then he was embarrassed. He was alone in his own house, talking to himself. Worse. Talking to someone who wasn\u2019t there. To someone who had been dead for more than a hundred years.</p><p>But he spoke aloud again. \u201cI promise. I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>He took the tin and left the basement, still feeling that sense of urgency, that certainty that time was of the utmost importance. He headed straight to the copies of the files from Robert Adair\u2019s folders and those Alice had given him, and started cross-referencing. He found one name in both.</p><p>Heidi Arundsen.</p><p>Genevieve had worked with her.</p><p>The cops had interviewed her regarding a girl who had disappeared about a month before Genevieve O\u2019Brien.</p><p>On his way to the door, he was waylaid by a phone call.</p><p>Didi Dancer.</p><p>\u201cJoe?\u201d she inquired almost hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cDidi. How are you? Is everything okay?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. I think I might have found someone who can help you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a Starbucks on my street. How about if we meet you there?\u201d she added. \u201cYou know where.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way.\u201d</p><p>As he drove, he organized his mind, much as he organized his papers. Fact one: He was now convinced that Genevieve O\u2019Brien had been kidnapped, and that she had been taken by the same person or persons responsible for the disappearances of the prostitutes. She had last been seen getting into a dark sedan.</p><p>She might still be alive somewhere.</p><p>Possibly beneath the city.</p><p>Buried sins.</p> <p>Fact two: The explosion at Hastings House had not been an accident. Okay, that wasn\u2019t a proven fact, but it was a supposition so strong that he felt comfortable treating it as fact.</p><p>Fact three: Matt, who had died in that explosion, had written a number of articles on the disappearances.</p><p>Theory: All three things were related. Matt\u2019s death, the missing prostitutes, Genevieve O\u2019Brien.</p><p>He felt a quickening in his heart. What had Matt known? What had he known that he hadn\u2019t realized he knew? Whatever it was, it had so disturbed a killer that he\u2019d conceived and carried out the perfect plan, a targeted execution that appeared, even after a thorough investigation, to be an accident.</p><p>He reached for his cell phone. Robert Adair\u2019s assistant got him a number, and in moments he was talking with Greta Peterson.</p><p>She was surprised to hear from him, and he forced himself to chat with her a few minutes, explaining that yes, he was busy, yes, he was fine, yes, he\u2019d seen Leslie, yes, they had a lot in common, yes...</p> <p>She was more surprised when he asked her for list of everyone who had attended the gala, and for every caterer, police officer and private security person who had worked it. He also asked for a list of anyone who had recently done work at Hastings House.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I gave all those lists to the police.\u201d She paused, then said sadly, \u201cIt was an accident, Joe. You looked into it yourself. The file is closed.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s been reopened, Joe thought. Aloud he said only, \u201cGreta, you\u2019re a dear, but I can\u2019t let it go, not yet. Will you get the lists for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could I refuse you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Can you messenger them over to Hastings House by this evening?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cSure. If it will help you come to terms with what happened, go over it all you want.\u201d</p><p>As he hung up, he had the strange sensation that he wasn\u2019t alone. The feeling was so strong that he actually looked to his right, at the passenger seat. There was no one there. Of course not, you fool. You would have known if someone had jumped in the car.</p><p>But he looked in the rearview mirror, as well, feeling even more like a fool.</p> <p>Suddenly he thought he heard a whisper. Something teasing in his ear, indistinct at first. It was the breeze, he told himself; he had the window rolled down. It was the sound of a radio on the street somewhere nearby. It was conversation coming at him from the crowded sidewalks of Manhattan.</p><p>Whatever it was, it seemed to form a name in his mind.</p><p>Leslie...</p><p>There was an urgency to the sound, which irritated him; common sense and logic were his bywords. Then again, ever since he had known Leslie, he had to admit that somehow what she saw was clearer, what she intuited was often real....</p><p>\u201cScrew it,\u201d he said aloud.</p><p>And then, despite his own plans, he headed to the library.</p><p>Leslie left the library with a roll of copies in her hands. She\u2019d thought she would grab a taxi, but it was midday and the traffic was insane. Actually, she liked the subway, she thought as she headed for the nearest station. It was usually fast and rarely got hung up by traffic jams.</p><p>She hurried down the steps, finding her MetroCard as she went. The entry smelled only slightly of urine. There was an obviously handicapped man with a sign sitting by one wall, and she stopped to drop a dollar in his cap. Before she could reach the turnstile, she saw a skinny old woman with a skinny dog. That demanded another pause for a dollar.</p><p>Since she\u2019d already opened her heart to the first two, she paused to give the twentysomething leaning against the yellow tiles and playing the flute a dollar, too.</p><p>As she dropped the bill into his flute case, she felt a sense of something again, a sense of being watched. This was the subway, for God\u2019s sake, she told herself. Full of people. Anyone could be watching her.</p><p>She paused. There was something in her head, a niggling piece of knowledge, but she couldn\u2019t quite get it to make sense. It nagged at her even more strongly as she stood at the top of the stairs leading down to the train platform. She was in the subway. Underground. There were miles and miles of subway tunnels. Maybe that was it. Over the years, subway workers had discovered any number of relics while digging new lines. And there were unused tunnels, too, so...</p><p>Great. The killer was probably burying his victims. Wow. Big break. But where?</p><p>Huge city. Huge underground.</p><p>She started. That strange feeling of being watched struck her again.</p><p>Sure, she was being watched. By the guy with the dull eyes in the corner. He wasn\u2019t really seeing anything, though.</p><p>It was just a feeling, she told herself.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t that simple. It was...disturbing. She looked around. And saw a dozen people, none of whom seemed to be staring at her.</p><p>New Yorkers were busy people on the move.</p><p>Oh, Matt, I\u2019m really becoming a total paranoid. If only...</p><p>If only you would speak to me....</p><p>Matt was dead.</p><p>He lived only in her dreams.</p><p>With a mental shake of irritation, she moved on, heading down to the train platform.</p><p>People walked fast in New York. She joined the throng, people-watching as she went. There were the tourists, carrying guidebooks and looking around with wide eyes. There were the businessmen and women, looking crisp in their dark suits. There were punks with ski caps and students reading textbooks, oblivious to the world around them, their iPods all the company they needed.</p><p>A train had just left when she reached her track. She found her mind wandering as she waited for the next one to arrive.</p><p>She was happy, she realized, and she hoped desperately that she would be able to bring peace to Elizabeth Martin. Poor Elizabeth. She wanted to be vindicated so badly. The thing was, so many years had passed...who remained to know or care? It wasn\u2019t as if she could go to Elizabeth\u2019s loved ones and explain or ease their pain. But Joe had met a reporter the other night\u2014heck, she knew dozens of reporters, she realized\u2014she could get someone to do a story. She could see that Elizabeth received a proper burial.</p><p>She noticed a group of people coming down the stairs, crowding onto the platform, surging and jostling behind her. She staggered a bit but held her position behind the yellow line.</p><p>As she did, she felt a gust of fear again.</p><p>Cold at the nape of her neck.</p><p>Unease.</p><p>As if she were prey and something was stalking her.</p><p>She started to turn.</p><p>She was hit in the back by a heavy shove.</p><p>The next thing she knew, she was flying toward the track.</p><p>And she could hear the shrill cry of the approaching train, speeding along the rails.</p><p>12</p><p>J oe couldn\u2019t find a place to park his car. What had he expected? This was New York.</p><p>But the sense of danger was so real that he didn\u2019t care. Even knowing he would be towed, he pulled into the first empty space he found along Fifth Avenue. He raced up the stairs to the library, past the magnificent lions, and inside. A second\u2019s hesitation sent him to research, where an attractive young woman told him that he had just missed Leslie MacIntyre, who\u2019d made the copies she wanted and headed out. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to get a cab this time of day, so she probably took the subway. She said she was heading back to Hastings House.\u201d</p><p>Joe barely thanked her. He hadn\u2019t seen Leslie on the street, which meant he had already lost precious time. For all he knew, she could already be on a subway downtown.</p><p>A voice inside his head kept mocking him. She\u2019s fine. She was at the library. You\u2019re acting like a madman. She\u2019s on her way home.</p><p>But another thought kept plaguing him endlessly.</p><p>Buried sins.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t heading down into a crypt, some dark hollow in the earth. Well, not really. She was going to ride the New York City subway, used by thousands of commuters on an hourly basis.</p><p>Still...</p><p>He saw the entrance and ran down the stairs, scanning the signs for trains heading toward the downtown financial district. He leapt over the turnstile, again damning himself as a madman. Great. His car was going to be towed, and if the subway attendant yelling at him had his way, he would also be arrested.</p><p>As he rushed headlong through throngs of people on the stairs, he felt a sense of dread as he headed toward the platform.</p><p>Screams echoed from below, and he ran faster, shoving people out of his way and taking the steps two at a time.</p><p>Move!</p><p>In a split second, Leslie was aware of so many things. The vibration of the ground beneath her. The bruises forming on her flesh. The awkward way she was lying. The fear that she was going to be electrocuted. The squeak and scurrying of the subway rats...</p><p>And that voice.</p><p>Move!</p><p>She couldn\u2019t move; she was stunned, breathless and in agony.</p><p>Move!</p><p>Suddenly, arms were reaching for her, pulling her up.</p><p>Matt...? Yes, it was Matt!</p><p>She blinked, and then she was up, moving with the speed of light. There were arms again, real arms, strong, powerful arms, grabbing her and dragging her up and...</p><p>She was lying on the platform. She heard the whistle of the train; felt the air rushing over her, the train so close that its passing rustled her hair, touched her face.</p><p>There were new sounds. People. Voices rising in indignation.</p><p>\u201cSweet Jesus\u2014did you see that? She was nearly squashed like a bug!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God someone got her out!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe got herself out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s horrible, Harold. I\u2019m always telling you, it\u2019s horrible\u2014people pushing and shoving down here all the time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey should be arrested!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho should be arrested? I couldn\u2019t tell who did it.\u201d</p><p>She just lay there, gasping for breath, staring up. Joe. Joe was there, hunkered down by her side. She tried to smile. He looked up as two policemen came running along the platform, calling for people to get back, to give her some air.</p> <p>\u201cThe paramedics are on their way,\u201d a young uniformed cop said, squatting down by Joe.</p><p>She tried to rise up on her elbows, looking at Joe for help, wondering how in hell he had managed to be there. \u201cI\u2019m all right. I\u2019m luckier than a lottery winner, but I\u2019m all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit tight,\u201d Joe said. He had the strangest expression on his face. \u201cDid you break anything? Are you in pain?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t have a chance to answer, because just then there was a break in the crowd, and two young paramedics, a man and a woman, made their way to her side.</p><p>Joe and the officer backed off as the paramedics started gently questioning her. She explained as best she could that she was all right, that she was just bruised and the wind was knocked out of her. In a few seconds they determined that she had no broken bones, her back wasn\u2019t injured, and she could be moved.</p> <p>The pulse of the city could keep thundering.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d the second officer asked when it became clear that there was no immediate medical emergency.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. It was really crowded down here,\u201d she said.</p><p>He looked fiercely concerned. \u201cWere you pushed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, of course I was pushed. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you didn\u2019t...you didn\u2019t jump, did you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d she replied indignantly.</p><p>\u201cDid you see anyone who looked like they wanted to hurt you? Did you see any gang members down here? Anyone out of the ordinary?\u201d</p><p>She stared back blankly. \u201cI don\u2019t come here every day. I didn\u2019t see any gang members. I think the platform was just very crowded, and people were getting edgy and worried about getting on a train when it did come. Look\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake it easy, Leslie,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>Then, while the paramedics continued to watch her gravely, the officer grilled Joe, who produced his ID and said that he\u2019d known she was at the library, and that he\u2019d come to find her, he hadn\u2019t just happened to be on the platform.</p><p>It was a nightmare.</p><p>And despite her protests, she was put into an ambulance to be taken to the hospital, where a doctor would officially ascertain the nature of her injuries. And though Joe rode in the ambulance with her, the police officer came, too, taking down her statement.</p><p>They both left her while the doctor on duty ordered X-rays and went through a long checklist of symptoms with her, and gave her a thorough physical exam. She had to explain that the little bump on her head was left over from an earlier accident. That seemed to concern him, which disturbed her. Did the man think she was suicidal?</p> <p>Robert Adair showed up with Ken Dryer. Leslie was ready to pull her hair out. She wanted nothing more than to be alone, to try to remember those fateful seconds in the subway, to remember them exactly, to understand what had happened.</p><p>The voice.</p><p>Had it been Joe\u2019s voice? Had he been there, down on the platform, with her?</p><p>She didn\u2019t know. All she remembered for sure was Joe being there, reaching for her, pulling her up off the track.</p><p>\u201cYou sure do like to create a lot of excitement,\u201d Ken Dryer teased, coming in once she was dressed and the doctor had moved on to his next patient.</p><p>Robert, who was right behind him, looked both irritated and anxious. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I have a bruise on my thigh, and it hurts. Is it anything bad? No. Please, I\u2019m desperate just to get out of here,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Ken asked.</p><p>\u201cIt was crowded in the subway. People push and shove. I should have been more careful. I should have stayed farther back. It was an accident.\u201d</p><p>Even as she said the word, she thought it sounded hollow.</p><p>An accident?</p><p>The blast at Hastings House had been an accident.</p><p>The ceiling giving way in the crypt had been an accident.</p><p>Move!</p><p>Who had whispered the word to her? Had Matt somehow been with her in a time of mortal danger, or had she seen Joe\u2019s face in the crowd and imagined that her dead lover had reached out from the grave to help her?</p><p>Joe pushed past the others to get to her where she lay on the hospital bed. \u201cYou should stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I have work to do,\u201d he said ruefully.</p><p>She stared at the drawn, but still striking, contours of his face and longed to touch him. \u201cHow did you happen to be there?\u201d she marveled.</p><p>\u201cI was afraid for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. But the doctor wants to keep you overnight for observation, and I think you should stay here.\u201d</p><p>She stared back at him. And lied.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Sure.\u201d</p><p>He arched a skeptical brow. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMy papers!\u201d she exclaimed, sitting up suddenly.</p><p>\u201cYour papers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a bunch of copies from the library,\u201d she said with dismay.</p><p>\u201cStuff you had from the library, huh? I\u2019ll, uh, see if the paramedics collected your things,\u201d Robert said. She could tell that he was humoring her. They all thought she was either insane or ungrateful. She had survived a fall onto the tracks when a train had been coming, saved by no more than a few seconds from a hideous death, and she was worried about some papers.</p><p>But...</p><p>It mattered. Somehow, it all mattered. And the \u201caccidents\u201d wouldn\u2019t stop happening until she figured out why.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Robert,\u201d she called after him as he left the exam room.</p><p>\u201cLooks like I\u2019ll be warning people to be careful on the subways tonight.\u201d Ken Dryer squeezed her hand. \u201cYou sure you\u2019re okay, kid? I know it\u2019s my job, but I\u2019m getting to be a regular on the news, and you seem to have a lot to do with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God you\u2019re good on TV,\u201d she told him. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>He left. Joe was still tarrying, but before he could say anything, Robert returned to the room. \u201cSome kind citizen apparently gathered your purse and whatever papers they could find. The nurses will see that your things are returned.\u201d He stared at her, then at Joe, then at her again. \u201cYou know...I\u2019d been anxious to see you myself. I thought maybe you could help with the missing hookers. But now...I think you ought to leave town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave town? I\u2019m in the middle of a project,\u201d Leslie protested.</p><p>Robert shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving town,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cRobert, please. This is ridiculous. If it hadn\u2019t been me, it would have been someone else. The subway was a zoo. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s all. Okay?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her, shook his head, started out, then turned back. \u201cStay safe,\u201d he said firmly. He shot Joe a look that seemed to blame him, then left.</p><p>She noticed that Joe looked thoughtful as he watched the other man leave. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He turned back to her, leaning over her, arms braced on either side of the mattress. \u201cI need to know. I need to know a lot. You are going to stay here, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet. As soon as they find me a room, I\u2019ll catch a nice nap. Some nice candy striper will bring me tea and lunch. It will be great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt had better be,\u201d he warned. And then, at last, he left her.</p><p>To Joe\u2019s amazement, Didi was still waiting for him at Starbucks. She was with another woman.</p><p>\u201cJoe!\u201d Didi called when he entered, and stood, smiling.</p><p>\u201cYou waited all this time,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who is this?\u201d Joe asked politely.</p><p>She was tiny, blond and blue-eyed. She looked a little edgy, though.</p><p>\u201cDo you want some coffee?\u201d he asked, trying to put her at ease.</p><p>\u201cHeidi wants a cigarette,\u201d Didi said.</p><p>Joe\u2019s eyes riveted on the woman. \u201cYou\u2019re Heidi Arundsen?\u201d</p><p>She nodded nervously. Her size and delicate bone structure made her look young. But there was a tension about her, a strain, that showed her age.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead. There are some tables outside. I\u2019m going to get myself some coffee. Can I get you ladies something while I\u2019m at it?\u201d</p><p>He expected an answer of \u201cJust regular coffee.\u201d Maybe with cream or sugar. But Heidi wanted a double latte with a shot of sugar-free vanilla syrup and fat-free milk. Didi was into a grande mocha, two pumps only, no whipped cream, and a piece of coffee cake.</p><p>In line, he chafed. But he had no intention of scaring Heidi away from spilling whatever she might be able to tell him. So he waited. And he was careful to get the order right. When he joined the two women at the table, he sat down casually, asked if he\u2019d gotten everything right, then waited.</p><p>\u201cHeidi saw the car, too,\u201d Didi informed him.</p><p>\u201cThe dark sedan?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Heidi looked at Didi, as if for reassurance. Then she turned back to Joe. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just dark, it was black. Tinted windows. Like Betty Olsen.\u201d</p><p>It took him a second to shift gears. Then the name registered as one he\u2019d seen in the files about the missing prostitutes. Betty Olsen had disappeared approximately a month before Genevieve O\u2019Brien. Betty hadn\u2019t been listed in Genevieve\u2019s case folders, but Heidi had been interviewed after Betty was reported missing.</p><p>\u201cBetty was a friend of yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetty lived in my building. I was out with her, chatting on the street, you know. And I saw her get into the black sedan. And that was the last time I saw her. Black,\u201d she repeated. \u201cI know it was black.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t remember the make or model?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Heidi shook her head. \u201cIt was sleek-looking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleek...clean, in good shape, that kind of thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike some kind of official car?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she said, but she sounded uncertain. \u201cI\u2019ve seen hundreds of cars like it on the street. To tell you the truth, a couple things ran through my mind. I was thinking the dude probably had money. And I was thinking Betty might have known him, \u2019cuz she didn\u2019t stand by the window negotiating, just got right in.\u201d</p><p>Joe leaned back, puzzled. Who would have been driving around in a black sedan who knew both Genevieve O\u2019Brien and a prostitute so well that they would both just jump in the car with him?</p><p>\u201cI wish I could tell you more,\u201d Heidi said.</p><p>\u201cTell me more about Betty,\u201d he said.</p><p>Heidi looked sad and shook her head. \u201cWell, for one thing, her name wasn\u2019t really Betty. She was in the country illegally. She couldn\u2019t get a regular job because...she doesn\u2019t have a social security number, and she doesn\u2019t pay taxes.\u201d She sniffed. \u201cShe lives in my building because the landlord is an asshole who doesn\u2019t ask questions \u2019cuz it\u2019s a roach motel. Half the tenants just name the rats and pretend they\u2019re pets. Genevieve talked to her one time about a way for her to get the right papers so she could stay in the country.\u201d She hesitated, looking at Didi again. \u201cI\u2019m the one who called the police. I called from the pay phone down the street. But they wanted me to fill out a lot of forms, and...anyway, they didn\u2019t do nothing. But I got Maria Rodriguez from my building to go down and file a report. She even took a day off work to do it. Didi and I made the time up for her, though. She scrubs floors.\u201d She hesitated, a strange look on her face. \u201cAre you thinking Didi and I should scrub floors, too? That anything would be better than what we do? Maria has a scar and she\u2019s self-conscious, otherwise she\u2019d be out here, too. Don\u2019t fool yourself that there aren\u2019t a lot of women out there tired of scrubbing and more than willing to hit the streets.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHeidi, I wasn\u2019t about to judge you, I swear. I\u2019m grateful for whatever you can tell me.\u201d</p><p>Heidi leaned back, not looking quite so friendly. \u201cRight. \u2019Cuz this time a rich girl disappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeidi, I was hired because a rich girl disappeared. I hope I can stop whatever is happening so no more girls disappear, rich or poor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget the Mimic,\u201d Didi said.</p><p>Heidi waved a hand in the air. \u201cWhen he dressed up, the Mimic was the prettiest girl I\u2019ve ever seen. He was taken by accident, I bet.\u201d She stared hard at Joe. \u201cAnd they\u2019re dead, aren\u2019t they? They\u2019re all dead. And you know what? I told the cops Betty disappeared in a black sedan, a nice sedan, but they think she disappeared after that. Even though they never found anyone who saw her after me. Why don\u2019t people ever want to believe that rich people can be perverts? Those assholes are looking for a bum, a dealer...some low-life creep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeidi, believe me, the cops aren\u2019t fools. They put policewomen out on the streets for a while, right?\u201d</p> <p>Heidi let out a sigh and nodded. \u201cYeah, they did. But I never saw that car when those girls were around. Though...hey!\u201d She sat back suddenly, staring at him. \u201cI know you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dead.\u201d Her mouth opened in an O. \u201cI saw your picture in the paper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw my cousin\u2019s picture in the paper. He was in the paper a lot. He wrote a column. He was killed last year in an explosion at Hastings House.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHastings House?\u201d Heidi murmured.</p><p>\u201cDo you know something about Hastings House?\u201d</p><p>Heidi shrugged sadly. \u201cNo...but I remember Betty saying how Genevieve wanted to go to that party thing there last year\u2014the one that ended up with that explosion. She told Betty some snooty society friend of her aunt\u2019s was in charge but she wasn\u2019t going to beg to be invited. She used to walk by the place all the time, though.\u201d</p><p>Those words stunned him into silence. He wasn\u2019t sure what this new information meant, if anything, but it was a link. A tenuous link.</p> <p>A \u201clink\u201d that might mean nothing.</p><p>Lots of people walked past historic sites. Some people walked by them every day, hurrying to work, never noticing them. But others loved the fact that they could walk by places that had a history, that meant something.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d he said at last. What the hell did he see?</p><p>\u201cHeidi, is there anything else?\u201d Didi asked for him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so....\u201d She brightened suddenly. \u201cI have Betty\u2019s things. That bastard landlord just dumped them in the hall, so I I took them. Just in case she came back, you know? You can see them. I mean, if you\u2019re interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would love to go through Betty\u2019s things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you\u2014I live in a roach motel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see if I can kill a few for you. Lead the way.\u201d</p><p>Leslie did stay at the hospital. She stayed for two hours. Then she checked herself out, collected her belonging and discovered that she had a dozen messages on her cell phone. One of them was from Brad, and she hastily called him as soon as she reached the street\u2014determined to catch a cab and not ride the subway again, at least not that day.</p><p>He answered his phone immediately and went off on a tirade. What had happened to her? Why hadn\u2019t she made sure someone called him? Was she all right? He was furious that he\u2019d had to hear about what happened on the news. How could she do this to him?</p><p>\u201cBrad, you\u2019re being dramatic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Do you remember calling me, asking me to meet you this afternoon?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cAnd I still want to meet you. At Hastings House.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be an idiot. You almost died today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t. And I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m on my way to Hastings House now. Are you coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. I\u2019ll beat you there.\u201d</p><p>He did.</p><p>He was lounging on the porch with Melissa when the cab dropped her off.</p><p>They both rushed to the curb to help her from the cab. It took her twenty minutes and more energy than she had to spare to convince Melissa that she was all right. Then she led Brad down to the basement, where she showed him the wall and the bones, and the records she had copied from the library, then told him what she wanted him to do.</p><p>He stared at her. He almost looked as if he were frightened of her.</p><p>\u201cShit. This is getting uncanny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrad, I\u2019ve studied the history of this house. It will work.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYou want me to pretend that I just walked into Hastings House and started on the basement wall with a pickax because I knew that I\u2019d find bones?\u201d</p><p>She took a step back from him, frowning. Actually, yes, that was exactly what she wanted.</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too good at this, and it\u2019s getting scary,\u201d he informed her.</p><p>\u201cBrad, please?\u201d</p><p>He crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cWhat does Wonder Boy think about all this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonder Boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be an idiot,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSorry. I guess I\u2019m jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been a very good friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo have I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, Brad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. But what does he think? I mean, is he getting a little freaked out, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you getting at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t keep pretending to be in on all your discoveries\u2014especially not when someone else knows the truth.\u201d</p><p>She started to laugh. \u201cI think you don\u2019t mind doing it, you just don\u2019t want to get caught.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d he admitted, laughing suddenly. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m pathetic. I love to get the credit. But it\u2019s not mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want any credit. I just want things...taken care of. Look, I know who this woman is. Her husband murdered her and told the world she\u2019d left him. We need to bring the truth to light.\u201d</p><p>He was silent for a moment, his head lowered. \u201cAll right. You read the records, got me to do the same. We shared some logic and a hunch. We\u2019ll prove who she is when we make the announcement, and we\u2019ll get her a nice burial with all the right...whatever. Like I\u2019m sure it makes a difference, all these years later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt makes a difference,\u201d Leslie insisted.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cAll right. Tomorrow we\u2019ll make the announcement and arrange to have the bones removed. I\u2019ll find a reporter and a priest\u2014Episcopalian? Do we know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll assume. New York at the time...mostly Episcopalian.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThe crypt you discovered is shored up now. Laymon is going to be going insane to move in that direction, too. And now you\u2019re going to be more famous than ever\u2014she has second sight, and she survived a cave-in and a subway accident. People will be talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrad, come on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not me, Leslie. That\u2019s just what people are going to say.\u201d</p><p>She let out a soft sigh. \u201cJust help me, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best. Hey, if you get any better at this ESP thing, maybe you can pick us some winning lottery numbers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve discovered bones, Brad. Not riches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, so work on that, will you?\u201d He looked exasperated, then pulled her to him and gave her a kiss on the forehead. \u201cLeslie...shit. I like you, but you really have gotten...eerie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks a lot, Brad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean anything bad by that, honestly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. I\u2019m creepy, but that\u2019s not bad.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cNo, you\u2019re creepy good,\u201d he assured her. \u201cAll right, I\u2019m going to get out of here. Get the ball rolling.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cBrad...at the site, when you found me, unconscious...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou and Laymon arrived at the exact same time?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, why?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo reason.\u201d</p><p>Brad suddenly frowned deeply. \u201cAre you going to ask where I was today?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>She stared back at him, stunned.</p><p>\u201cNowhere near the subway,\u201d he said curtly.</p> <p>\u201cOh, Brad! I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean...actually, I was hoping you\u2019d seen someone,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cNo. There was no other way in, no other way out. No one suspicious, and guards all over the site, Leslie. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d die before I\u2019d hurt you, Leslie,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m a coward,\u201d he added ruefully.</p><p>She stepped forward, kissing his cheek. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019d better get going. I\u2019m supposed to meet Laymon for dinner.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnthony\u2019s, just down the street. He doesn\u2019t like to leave the area. You know Laymon. He\u2019s always convinced someone is after his discovery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he can catch them from a restaurant?\u201d she asked, amused.</p><p>Brad shrugged. \u201cI guess he figures he can get back to the site quickly if he has to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink I should go with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want. Or I can tell him you\u2019re sore from the subway thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...I\u2019ll run up and take a shower. And call and invite Joe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoe. Yeah. Sure.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey, he\u2019s helping.\u201d</p><p>Brad took a deep breath. \u201cHelping? Or reminding you of Matt every single second?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re two very different people, and I know that, Brad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure of that?\u201d Brad persisted gently.</p><p>\u201cJoe is helping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoe\u2019s convinced the explosion here was intentional,\u201d Brad said wearily.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the hell would gain from it?\u201d Brad said.</p><p>She wondered if she should be dead honest when she was alone with him in a small underground room, then told herself not to be ridiculous. Melissa knew where they were, not to mention she had worked with Brad for years.</p><p>\u201cMaybe someone was trying to kill Matt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd didn\u2019t care about hurting a houseful of other people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot of people couldn\u2019t care less about who gets in the way when they have a goal in mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy kill Matt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause his voice mattered.\u201d</p><p>Brad looked down for a minute, then took a step toward her. To her amazement, he almost lost his balance and nearly fell face forward on top of her. She jumped, and he swore. \u201cWhere the hell did that box come from?\u201d he demanded irritably.</p><p>She reached out, steadied him, gave him a quick kiss on the cheek and retreated. \u201cLet\u2019s go on up.\u201d She hurried toward the stairs, suddenly afraid that he was going to drag her back.</p><p>He didn\u2019t. He followed her up, asking, \u201cSo you\u2019re coming to dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so. If I change my mind, I\u2019ll call your cell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot from down there, I hope,\u201d he told her, pointing back down the stairs. \u201cI doubt you\u2019ll get a signal down in your basement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going back to the basement,\u201d she said. \u201cDo me a favor? Tell Melissa I\u2019m going up to take a shower and not to worry about me, just to lock up when she leaves, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said, studying her. \u201cYou need a vacation, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve just started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still need a vacation.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cDo you really want to miss your chance to be famous? Or infamous? One or the other, anyway.\u201d She laughed. \u201cNow, get out of here. I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p><p>She waited until he was gone, listening as he talked to Melissa at the exit and then, when she was sure he was out the door, headed back down to the basement. She felt a desire so strong it was beyond resisting to go back to the basement.</p><p>Where the hell had the box that Brad had tripped over come from?</p><p>\u201cMatt?\u201d she whispered, then shook her head. Was there a feel to the room?</p><p>She had discovered the remains of a murdered woman, she told herself. It was natural that the basement would feel...haunted. But as she looked around, she could see various items that had been used to renovate the house. A few rolls of wallpaper, some paint cans, stirrers, boxes of nails and tools. She didn\u2019t feel as if it were a tomb, even though it had been exactly that for the poor woman in the wall. But there was something here that drew her, kept her from leaving. She needed to call Joe, she realized, and let him know that she\u2019d left the hospital, in case he was planning to go visit her, and invite him to dinner. She reached in her pocket for her cell phone, making a tour of the room as she did so.</p><p>It was exactly the size of the servants\u2019 pantry above. There was another basement beneath the main house; this area had been used strictly for food and kitchen storage.</p><p>From the hearth, she walked around the perimeter of the room, her phone forgotten in her hand. The wall was entirely bricked. She tried to estimate her whereabouts. If she were able to tunnel through the earth and went north, then a bit to the east, she would reach the dig. The crypt she\u2019d found there was quite a bit deeper than this basement, though. If she were to head further east, she realized, she would come to City Hall.</p><p>Curious, she laid out the subway construction records she had copied alongside those of the house. By the late 1900s, there had been elevated trains, or els, in Lower Manhattan. At the very beginning of the twentieth century, the first subway lines had gone in. The very first had run from City Hall to 145th Street. By 1910, there had been several lines. On a later map, she could see how many of the original tunnels had been abandoned. There were also work shafts that had once aided the subway workmen, and many of those had been abandoned, as well.</p><p>Okay, so there were a lot of holes in the Manhattan earth. What did that mean?</p><p>She hesitated, wondering if she was imagining the rush of air and looked around.</p><p>\u201cMatt?\u201d she said softly, hopefully. \u201cI know...oh, Matt, there\u2019s something of you here, I know it,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>It seemed, she thought, that she felt a touch. A caress, soft and tender, against her cheek. And then a whisper.</p><p>Leave...please, leave.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>You must.</p><p>\u201cLet me see you, touch you. I know you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>She waited.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>\u201cLeave the basement?\u201d she wondered aloud.</p><p>Go!</p><p>There was an urgency in the voice this time.</p><p>\u201cLeave the basement? Leave the house? Leave New York?\u201d Again, she spoke aloud. Again, all she felt in return was a movement of the air.</p><p>Or was it a cruel trick of her imagination?</p><p>\u201cMatt...in the subway, I saw you. I know Joe was there, too, and he pulled me out. But at the beginning...it was your face. Your voice.\u201d</p><p>Go. Go!</p><p>\u201cAll right!\u201d</p><p>She started to roll up her maps, and that was when she heard the sobbing.</p><p>13</p><p>T he place really was a rat hole. Joe wondered if there was an agency in the city that looked into situations like this. Probably. It would mean a lot of red tape, he was certain. Still, it was worth checking into, he decided.</p><p>Space was at a premium in New York, that was a given. But he knew there were laws to protect tenants against these kinds of situations. But since most of the inhabitants were either in the country illegally or made their living in a doubtful manner, he doubted their complaints drew much response, if they even dared to make them.</p><p>Still, Heidi Arundsen was a good hostess. She had a studio with a tiny kitchen, separated by a counter from the main room, and a screen that separated the main room from the little bedroom area she had created. She kept the place spotlessly clean, but that couldn\u2019t help the leakage marks on the ceiling and walls, or hide the fact that the plaster was peeling and that some of the wires weren\u2019t properly installed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Heidi said as they entered. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou keep a lovely home,\u201d he told her. \u201cUnder the worst circumstances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...thanks. Can I get you anything? I keep everything in the fridge. No bug eggs in my stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, honestly, I\u2019m just fine.\u201d</p><p>Didi had joined them. She strode across the room. \u201cHere are the boxes with Betty\u2019s things. The cops looked for a diary and didn\u2019t find one,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not much there, but I kept it all anyway. Just in case,\u201d Heidi said.</p><p>Her words seemed to linger on the air. Just in case. None of them believed Betty was ever coming back.</p><p>\u201cMind if I just dig in?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead,\u201d Heidi said. \u201cI\u2019ll go make some coffee.\u201d</p><p>Joe heard the women turn on a little television in the kitchen and talk softly to each other while he dug into the boxes. He didn\u2019t know what he expected to find. The first box was clothing. Washed, smelling pleasantly of fabric softener, neatly folded. Betty must have been tiny. She had skirts that would have served as a handkerchief for him.</p><p>He opened the second box and found pictures. Betty, looking young and innocent, hopeful, a brilliant smile on her face as she cradled a baby. People who might have been her parents. There was a picture of several women, Betty among them, playing softball in Central Park. There was a picture of a beautiful greyhound; on it, Betty had written, Someday! There were more pictures of Betty with friends in front of the sagging old tenement, at the zoo.</p><p>Then he found a picture that arrested his attention. It was of Betty and Genevieve O\u2019Brien\u2014and there was a man with them. He was turned away from the camera, but his stance spoke of assurance, and he was wearing a suit that looked to have been expensively tailored. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHeidi?\u201d he called.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d she asked, hurrying over to where he was, Didi on her heels.</p><p>\u201cWho is that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s Betty. And Genevieve. I thought you were hired to find her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, the man. Who\u2019s the man with them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea,\u201d she said. \u201cHey!\u201d she said, her attention caught by the television. \u201cHey, Joe, your girlfriend is on the news.\u201d</p> <p>He set the box down quickly and strode into the kitchen to join them. The mayor himself was on, sternly warning people to be careful in the subway.</p><p>Ken Dryer was at his side. He went on to announce that it was Leslie MacIntyre, the archaeologist who\u2019d been in the news recently, who had fallen and been pulled up just ahead of a speeding train. She had been taken to the hospital, but she was all right. There was a shot of Leslie, grimy and a bit tousled, smiling up at him as he walked beside the stretcher as the paramedics carried her up from the subway.</p><p>The anchorwoman went on to mention that in addition to her archaeological career, Leslie MacIntyre had been of help to the police on occasion.</p><p>\u201cThe girl must have special instincts,\u201d the co-anchor said, shaking his head. \u201cThink ghosts are coming out of the walls to give her a hand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to have her on the show,\u201d the anchorwoman said, then turned to face a different camera. \u201cIn late-breaking news from the Middle East...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she psychic?\u201d Heidi asked.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe she should go through Betty\u2019s things, huh?\u201d Didi asked.</p><p>Joe was already dialing the hospital on his cell, pacing the room as he was forwarded from extension to extension.</p><p>At last a nurse informed him that Miss MacIntyre had checked herself out a few hours after being admitted to the ER.</p><p>\u201cDamn!\u201d he swore violently, then turned to the two women. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go. Listen...\u201d He wanted to throttle Leslie. He really needed to work on Genevieve\u2019s disappearance, but he was growing more and more afraid to leave Leslie alone for a minute. \u201cDo you think I could hire the two of you?\u201d</p><p>They looked at each other in surprise.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2014\u201d Didi began, but he cut her off.</p><p>\u201cNo...no. I mean as assistants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAssistants?\u201d Didi murmured.</p> <p>\u201cDoes he mean...a threesome?\u201d Heidi asked.</p><p>\u201cI mean, to work for me.\u201d He picked up the picture of Betty, Genevieve and the mystery man. \u201cI need to get this picture to a man named Harry Barton, up in Soho. If I give you an address, can you get it to him for me? And tell him that I need the man in the picture enhanced as much as he can. I\u2019ll pay you for being messengers, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a relief,\u201d Heidi muttered. \u201cSorry\u2014I guess I didn\u2019t want you to turn out to be a weirdo. I can still dream, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t have to pay us,\u201d Didi told him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to pay you because you work for a living and I\u2019m using your time, plus I\u2019m being paid, okay?\u201d</p><p>They looked at each other again.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a rich lady\u2019s money,\u201d he said. \u201cYou might as well get your piece of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone deal. Give us the address. And if you think of anything else...?\u201d Didi said, a question in her tone as her voice trailed off.</p><p>\u201cActually, yes. I want you both on the streets tonight,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a real reformer, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Heidi asked Didi.</p><p>\u201cNot taking tricks. I want you to keep an eye out all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a black sedan,\u201d Didi said.</p><p>\u201cYou got it. Okay, address...and I\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d</p><p>Joe ran down the six flights of stairs, thinking again that something needed to be done about the place. He hoped he knew the right people to do it.</p><p>If Matt were alive, he would write a column that would have the landlord all but boiled in oil by enraged citizens.</p><p>But Matt wasn\u2019t alive.</p><p>When he reached the street, he paused. Strange. This morning it had been as if he was being warned to get to Leslie. Now...</p><p>Now, nothing. Where the hell had she gone? Back to Hastings House. He was sure of it.</p><p>The crying had faded.</p><p>Leslie walked around and around, listening for it, but it was gone. She sat on the box Brad had tripped over, frustrated. Then, suddenly, she heard it again.</p><p>She leapt up, trying to determine where the sound was coming from. At first, as she neared the hearth, she thought she had zeroed in on it. But when she got there, it seemed to be coming from the other side of the room. She walked around the small room, one hand on the wall as she went. It was all brick, and it all looked as if it had been there, getting grimy, forever.</p><p>The sound faded away again, and she went back to sitting on the box. Okay, so she was hearing ghostly tears. But she\u2019d dug the woman out of the wall. She was doing all she could. \u201cYou know,\u201d she said aloud, \u201cif you would all just show yourselves, I could be much more helpful.\u201d</p><p>She began to walk around the room again, this time pressing on the bricks, looking for...something.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help thinking that there was more here than met the eye. She thought about the underground railroad. And here, it might really have been underground. There were so many tunnels nearby. Underground tunnels, underground chambers. A city beneath the city.</p><p>\u201cLeslie!\u201d</p><p>She froze, stepping away from the wall, stunned.</p><p>The voice had come from above, from the servants\u2019 pantry.</p><p>\u201cLeslie?\u201d</p><p>Someone was coming down the stairs. Instinctively, she backed away, looking toward the stairs and the man coming toward her.</p><p>\u201cLeslie?\u201d</p><p>It was Hank Smith.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he greeted her. \u201cWhat are you doing down here? I saw the open hatch and came to check, but Brad said you were going to shower and meet him for dinner,\u201d he said, coming toward her, looking concerned. \u201cYou know, you\u2019re scaring the hell out of us. I can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t hurt yourself with that kind of a fall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few bruises, that\u2019s all. I was lucky,\u201d she said. He\u2019d closed the hatch behind him, she realized. It had gotten darker, with only artificial light around them. Corners became deep shadows.</p><p>Hank was, as usual, handsomely dressed, but his attire was GQ casual. White cotton shirt, beige jacket, jeans, Dockers. Hair clean and slick, smelling of a subtle aftershave.</p><p>\u201cSo...what are you doing here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI came to check on you, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that was sweet of you. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>He looked around the basement. Shuddered. \u201cDark and creepy down here, huh?\u201d</p><p>She laughed, aware that she sounded a little uneasy. The whole house seemed to be silent now. And she felt...unnerved to be alone down in the bowels of the earth with him.</p><p>I felt safer down here alone listening to ghostly tears, she thought.</p><p>\u201cNot at all, not to me,\u201d she said, forcing a bright tone. Was it overly bright? Did he know that she was suddenly afraid to be with him?</p><p>He looked past her then and walked over to the wall, then turned to look at her. \u201cYou found more bones here?\u201d he said incredulously.</p><p>\u201cBrad found them, actually,\u201d she said. The room was too small. There was no way to put enough distance between them. Why the hell was she suddenly afraid of him? Or was it just being alone here with him? Even being alone with Brad had felt frightening, especially when he\u2019d tripped and she\u2019d momentarily thought he was attacking her.</p><p>Why not be scared? a voice in her mind taunted. I was in the crypt and the ceiling fell. I was in the subway and someone pushed me onto the tracks. Sure, accidents. Like the accidental explosion right here at Hastings House.</p><p>Hank was staring at her as if she had just turned emerald-green.</p><p>\u201cHank, you\u2019ve got an engineering degree, and I\u2019ll bet you know when you\u2019re going to encounter an old post or wall or...whatever.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his shoulders, let them fall. \u201cWhen there are old building plans, I can read them,\u201d he told her. \u201cBut...how the hell did you\u2014and don\u2019t tell me it wasn\u2019t you, it was Brad, \u2019cuz I know that\u2019s bullshit\u2014find bones here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same thing\u2014I can read. You know how it is. When something doesn\u2019t jive, you have to look for whatever the truth might be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...who is this?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cA Colonial housewife. Supposedly she left her husband and child, quite a scandal in those days. But women seldom desert their infants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d he said, and he sounded a little weary, a little jaded. \u201cLook at recent history. There are women who kill their own infants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, honestly, it\u2019s not the norm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes, women are the fairer sex,\u201d he said.</p><p>Did he sound bitter, or was he just teasing her?</p><p>\u201cIn this case,\u201d she said, \u201cit didn\u2019t ring true to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how did you know right where to look for the body?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrad and I talked about a situation, about a time and place...a basement tends to be a good place, and because of the way a hearth is constructed, it\u2019s easier to remove bricks there than from a wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there you go,\u201d Hank said. \u201cHas Laymon seen this yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Brad has?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I just told you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah. Brad was in on the find.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows it\u2019s here, knows I\u2019m always poking around down here,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d He smiled at her. She didn\u2019t like that smile at all. Maybe it was the light. Maybe it was the irrational panic that began to assail her when she was alone in an enclosed space with anyone larger than she was.</p><p>She opened her mouth to reply.</p><p>She didn\u2019t need to. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was standing by a stack of boxes. One suddenly teetered and fell, right by his side.</p><p>He jumped like a jack rabbit. A wrench bounced from the box and caught him on the knee. He howled with surprise and pain.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not safe down here!\u201d he exploded.</p> <p>\u201cRight. We should go up.\u201d</p><p>As she spoke, the hatch above them swung open. \u201cLeslie?\u201d</p><p>It was Joe, and he sounded deeply irritated.</p><p>\u201cJoe!\u201d she called in relief.</p><p>\u201cYou little liar! You said you were going to stay at the hospital.\u201d He was walking down the stairs as he spoke, then came to a dead stop when he saw Hank Smith. \u201cHank, I didn\u2019t know you were into archaeology,\u201d he said, his tone skeptical.</p> <p>\u201cI came to see how Leslie\u2019s doing\u2014same as you, I suppose,\u201d Hank said.</p><p>Joe ignored that. He looked as if he wanted to throw Hank across the room. She set an arm on his shoulder. \u201cI did stay for a few hours, and I\u2019m sorry, I meant to call you right away when I left. I felt fine, and I wanted to get back. I\u2019d made an appointment with Brad earlier, and I didn\u2019t want to break it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you were going to show Brad the discovery the two of you made together, right?\u201d Hank inquired politely.</p><p>\u201cNo, I had to make some plans with him,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a problem, Hank?\u201d Joe inquired.</p><p>\u201cYou know, it\u2019s getting really musty down here,\u201d Leslie cut in quickly. \u201cI\u2019m going up. Oh, and Joe, we\u2019re going to meet Laymon and Brad for dinner. Mind waiting while I grab a shower?\u201d She was up the stairs as she spoke. Joe followed on her heels, his eyes narrowed thoughtfully. As soon as Hank reached the top, she quickly closed the hatch, throwing the rug back over it. \u201cHank, it was very nice of you to come by, but I\u2019m fine. I\u2019ll see you over at the dig in the next few days, I imagine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure. Take care of yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you out,\u201d Joe told him.</p><p>\u201cI know the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to key in the alarm,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>They left the pantry, and Leslie followed them. Joe looked at her after he\u2019d closed the door. \u201cThat was a lie, you know. I don\u2019t know the alarm code.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, walked over to him and set the alarm. Then she reached into her pocket for a pen, pushed up his sleeve and wrote down the numbers. \u201cNow you do.\u201d</p><p>He was silent for a minute. \u201cI wonder who else has these numbers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny of the big muckety-mucks in the Historical Society, I imagine, plus Melissa, Jeff and Tandy,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA friend tells a friend, who tells a friend...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoe, stop. I\u2019m not leaving this house.\u201d</p><p>He caught her shoulders and looked earnestly into her eyes. \u201cCome and stay with me in Brooklyn. I won\u2019t touch you\u2014not unless you want me to. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoe, you are...\u201d She broke off, laughing. \u201cYou\u2019re walking testosterone. You\u2019re also courteous, compassionate...cute as the devil. And I\u2019m so grateful to have you on my side. But...there\u2019s something here. Something that has to be solved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. So that explains why I tell you not to leave a hospital and you leave it anyway. You don\u2019t call me. I come looking for you\u2014and you\u2019re in a dark basement with an asshole who should never be trusted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t invite him down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy point exactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need a shower. And, um, I didn\u2019t mean to presume or anything, but would you mind having dinner with Brad and Laymon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, at the moment I only mind when I don\u2019t know exactly where you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoe, you don\u2019t have to be so responsible for me just because...because of Matt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt is in my mind constantly,\u201d he told her quietly. \u201cBut, honestly, I\u2019m feeling responsible for you because you\u2019re scaring me to death. You\u2019re an accident waiting to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither that,\u201d she murmured, \u201cor...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr,\u201d he said bluntly, \u201csomeone did murder Matt. And that someone may feel you\u2019re too close to figuring out the truth.\u201d</p><p>She was startled by the wickedly stabbing trickle of pure ice that snaked down her spine. She prayed she wouldn\u2019t betray herself.</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cJoe, are you really seeing a connection between Hastings House, Matt, the prostitutes...and Genevieve O\u2019Brien?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I did learn today that Genevieve wanted an invitation to the gala. Does that mean anything? Maybe not. Half the city probably wanted an invitation, if not for the history, for the media exposure and the all-star attendance. Matt was writing about the prostitutes. Genevieve was trying to help the prostitutes. That\u2019s what I know. So...is a connection a long shot? Probably. But I haven\u2019t got a hell of a lot more to go on, other than a black sedan. And,\u201d he added very softly, his gaze probing as he met her eyes, \u201cyour belief that Genevieve is still alive.\u201d</p><p>She was tempted to go to him. To feel the real, live, flesh-and-blood assurance of his arms around her, breathe in his scent. He was a good man. True, he wasn\u2019t Matt, but if she\u2019d met him on the street, at lunch, at a friend\u2019s house...she would have been attracted to him. If...</p><p>If there had never been Matt.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI\u2019m going to shower. I\u2019ll be right down.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll be in the dead room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. The servants\u2019 pantry.\u201d</p><p>Leslie hurried on up the stairs. In her room, she leaned against the door, closing her eyes. \u201cMatt,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI know you\u2019re here. I know...I know you\u2019re looking after me. If only...oh, Matt...\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t cried in so long, but tears welled up in her eyes now.</p><p>And then...</p><p>She felt something brush against her face. The slightest caress. Just a touch...that wiped away her tears. She opened her eyes.</p><p>But she was alone.</p><p>Dinner was...boring.</p><p>Professor Laymon spent all of two seconds assuring himself that Leslie was really okay. There was only one love in that man\u2019s life, and that was his work.</p><p>Then he spent a good half hour talking about the work done in \u201cLeslie\u2019s crypt,\u201d as he called it. Then he started on the find in the basement, and that turned into an argument, because Leslie was absolutely insistent. Those particular bones were not going to become a spectacle. She was going to contact a friend of Matt\u2019s from the paper to see that the story was written up properly, and then she was going to find an Episcopal priest who would see to it that the woman was given a decent burial.</p><p>She was a tigress when she wanted to be. Joe watched with admiration as, in the end, she bested Laymon, who finally agreed to her plans.</p><p>But in return she swore that she would be back to work in the crypt the following day.</p><p>Joe decided he liked Brad better that night. He was willing to throw his weight Leslie\u2019s way when it came to the burial for the woman in the basement at Hastings House. He was also irritated that Laymon wasn\u2019t more considerate regarding Leslie\u2019s health.</p><p>Laymon didn\u2019t even seem to realize he was there until they got to dessert.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t write?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, Matt was the journalist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were a cop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a few years.\u201d</p><p>Joe never felt the need to explain himself. He certainly wasn\u2019t going to do so now.</p><p>He was surprised when Brad chose to do it for him.</p><p>\u201cJoe has a degree from Columbia in criminology. Police departments all over the country fly him in when they hit a dead end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Laymon looked at him with a new respect.</p><p>Joe lifted a hand. \u201cFresh eyes see new things sometimes,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let him fool you. He solved a big cocaine thing out in Vegas recently. The casinos didn\u2019t know how the dealers were getting the goods through their private security systems. They were doing it with coffee cups,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he told Brad. \u201cBut don\u2019t go being too impressed. To tell you the truth, I got the idea because of a plot I\u2019d seen on a television show once. They\u2019d probably seen it, too, so there you go.\u201d</p><p>Laymon stared at Leslie. \u201cWell, I guess it doesn\u2019t much matter where an inspiration comes from when it pans out, hmm?\u201d</p><p>Delicate little Italian cookies arrived at the table just then, along with Laymon\u2019s espresso, Leslie\u2019s cappuccino, and the plain old coffee he and Brad had ordered.</p><p>\u201cI understand you\u2019re convinced that the explosion at Hastings House was no accident,\u201d Laymon said, his eyes surprisingly sharp as they met Joe\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cHey, Matt was my cousin. Can\u2019t blame me if I question what happened,\u201d Joe said lightly.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you get the idea that Joe was still investigating the house?\u201d Leslie asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, hell.\u201d Laymon was clearly annoyed at being asked to explain himself. \u201cBrad and Ken have gotten to be drinking buddies. Ken knows what you\u2019re up to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not exactly \u2018up to\u2019 anything,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing on your quest for that young woman?\u201d Laymon demanded.</p><p>\u201cHopefully, I\u2019m getting a little closer every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter now?\u201d Laymon asked.</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been gone a long time. She\u2019s undoubtedly dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne way or the other, I\u2019ll find her,\u201d Joe said. He wasn\u2019t sure why, but the tension was growing around the table.</p><p>\u201cPass a cookie, Brad, please?\u201d Leslie said lightly. Joe lowered his head. She was always determined to defuse a tense situation. Smart. He should have held his temper better with Hank Smith that afternoon. He didn\u2019t want to find himself persona non grata at the site or anywhere else Leslie might be. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s sad,\u201d Laymon murmured. \u201cThe aunt\u2014Eileen Brideswell\u2014she\u2019s a major contributor to the Historical Society.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine she\u2019s a major contributor to many charities,\u201d Leslie said.</p><p>Laymon nodded, leaning back, crossing his arms over his chest. \u201cStrange woman, Eileen. She still loves all the musty little pubs of her youth. But, I\u2019ll tell you one thing. Genevieve O\u2019Brien\u2019s grandfather was a tough old hickory stick. He wouldn\u2019t have approved much of Genevieve. He didn\u2019t feel that a bum in the street\u2014or a prostitute\u2014should ever be helped with a red cent. He gave to charities, all right, but he picked them carefully. He wasn\u2019t about to give a dime to anyone he felt wasn\u2019t helping themselves. The old fellow is long dead and gone, or else I\u2019d say there was a good chance he\u2019d walled his own niece up somewhere himself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut he is dead. Long dead, as you say,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>Laymon shrugged. \u201cFunny thing, I\u2019d see the girl now and then. She loved to come and look at the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe appreciated history?\u201d Brad said.</p><p>\u201cI guess. But it was strange. She\u2019d walk around and around it. It was as if...it was as if she wasn\u2019t looking at the house, exactly, but at something more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t she come to the gala?\u201d Joe asked. \u201cI mean, you knew her, knew she was interested in the place. You could have given her an invitation.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt never occurred to me,\u201d Laymon said with a shrug. \u201cAll she had to do was ask her aunt if she wanted to go.\u201d</p><p>But she wouldn\u2019t have done that, Joe thought.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think Genevieve O\u2019Brien blew the place up out of some kind of bitterness, do you?\u201d Brad asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>\u201cThen she must have known something about the house that intrigued her,\u201d Leslie mused.</p><p>\u201cSuspected, anyway,\u201d Joe said.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think this is all getting a bit farfetched?\u201d Laymon said. \u201cThe blast was over a year ago.\u201d He looked at Joe. \u201cGenevieve has been missing...what? About two months?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight around that,\u201d Joe agreed.</p><p>\u201cWell, then, at least you can be pretty sure that no one was trying to blow her up,\u201d Laymon said cheerfully. \u201cShe disappeared months later.\u201d</p><p>He realized they were all staring at him. \u201cSorry, but you three are the ones putting a lot of the truth of the matter that the blast was an accident. Some sicko is picking up hookers, and Genevieve just wound up in the mix. One day the bodies will turn up. Maybe they\u2019ll get the guy, maybe they won\u2019t. Sad, but that\u2019s the way it is.\u201d</p><p>Joe shook his head, staring at Laymon. \u201cThat\u2019s the way it can be, but not this time. Trust me. This guy is going down.\u201d</p><p>Dinner had ended. Laymon offered to pick up the tab, and Joe let him. He thanked him for the meal, pulling back Leslie\u2019s chair for her. \u201cI\u2019ll see you home.\u201d He forced himself not to look at the other two men with real warning in his eyes. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll be on guard. All through the night.\u201d</p><p>Leslie felt guilty. Horribly guilty.</p><p>Joe would sit in his car all night again. She knew it.</p> <p>But she just couldn\u2019t ask him into the house for the night. Not yet.</p><p>She tried to talk him into going home, and he assured her that he would do so in the morning, when Hastings House was filled with people, when the bones in the basement were being gently removed\u2014when she wouldn\u2019t be alone with anyone. He made her swear to that last point.</p><p>If he thought she should have the decency to suggest that he sleep in the house, he didn\u2019t say so. It wasn\u2019t that there wasn\u2019t something about him, his touch, his scent, the sound of his voice.</p><p>There were just...things that needed to be solved. Leslie couldn\u2019t begin to voice what was going on in her heart and mind, and she was grateful that he didn\u2019t seem to expect her to.</p><p>Before he left her to return to his car, however, he asked her to look around for the list that Greta was supposed to have sent over that day. She found it on the kitchen counter and gave it to him. He told her not only to key in the alarm, but to lock her bedroom door, as well.</p><p>At the very least, she could do that for him. Upstairs, she locked herself in her bedroom and went to bed.</p><p>As usual, she lay awake, longing for something real. Longing to see Matt...</p><p>As she saw so many others.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t appear.</p><p>Not until she dreamed.</p><p>That night, he lay by her side, watching her. In her dream, she opened her eyes and saw him. His expression was grave. Only the slightest hint of a rueful smile curled his lips. He stroked her cheek, curled his fingers around hers.</p><p>\u201cYou were there, in the subway,\u201d she told him. \u201cYou saved me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoe pulled you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you gave me the strength I needed to move, to save myself. And both of you were pretty fierce in that basement tonight.\u201d</p><p>Matt pressed a kiss against her fingers. \u201cI keep trying.... I guess it takes time and practice, and then...maybe the heart or the soul or essence or whatever we are...maybe there are fragments of this being that have life of a sort. I can only find anything real in me when it comes to you, when I\u2019m afraid for you. Leslie, I really want you to leave this house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. Soon.\u201d</p><p>His smile broadened. \u201cJoe was right. You are a little liar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt...I can\u2019t live without knowing the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just hope you can live with it,\u201d he murmured, then shook his head, his expression growing pained. \u201cLeslie...I love you. You have to move on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I have my dreams. We have my dreams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeslie, I had my time. No one knows the rhyme or reason. No one knows...well, except maybe me, now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that I\u2019m here for you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cPoor Brad,\u201d she told him with amusement. \u201cYou made him trip, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid of all of them,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He was quiet. She thought that she had lost him, except she still felt his arms around her. \u201cSay they were after me when they set the explosion and just didn\u2019t care that three other people died.\u201d There was anger in his voice, anger that others might have died because of him. \u201cSay that it did have to do with my writing about the prostitutes. That would mean that, whoever the killer is, the abductor...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know if the girls are dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but...say there is something out there, very clever, obviously sick, a pervert, but a clever one...then I\u2019d say that person was here that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt, so many people were here that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe killer is hardly going to be a Broadway star,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cWell, unlikely, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s still in this vicinity on a regular basis? Who knows the area? David Laymon, Brad Vernon\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrad\u2019s been in Virginia until now,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cIs that really so far away?\u201d he queried. \u201cFour or five hours by car, less by plane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you were afraid of him this afternoon, weren\u2019t you? And I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s Brad. There\u2019s Greta, but she would die before doing anything to hurt this place, and anyway, it\u2019s not a woman taking the prostitutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething would have been said, someone would have noticed. That kind of thing...the girls on the street, the other girls, would have taken a closer look if it had been a woman. The place was teeming with cops, including our good friend Robert Adair, and the ever-in-front-of-the-camera Ken Dryer. And then there\u2019s Hank Smith.\u201d</p><p>He really didn\u2019t like Hank Smith, she thought, burrowing deeper into his arms.</p><p>\u201cDid you ever meet Genevieve O\u2019Brien?\u201d she asked sleepily.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she everything they say? Passionate, selfless, generous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI met her at the paper once. She was being interviewed by one of our reporters for the local section\u2014she was furious with the slumlords. She was lovely, vivacious, charming...and, yes, passionate. She really did care about other people. You think she\u2019s alive, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he murmured. She heard such a terrible note of frustration in his voice. If I could just change something, she heard beneath his words. If I could just make life right for someone else, then...then it would make sense.</p><p>She turned and held him fiercely. \u201cI love you so much.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go,\u201d she pleaded, then spoke no more. She didn\u2019t want to awaken; she didn\u2019t want to interrupt the vision that came to her by night.</p><p>In her dream, she drifted and, half asleep, felt him again. She turned in his arms. God, the dream was so vivid. She could feel his heat, the dampness of sweat on his skin, the strength of his muscles beneath her hands, the hardness of his body and his erection. The hot-lava stroke of his tongue over her flesh. Inside and out...his being, his essence, around her, within her. Lips on her breasts, intimately between her thighs. The pulse and beat and hunger of melding together, striving and writhing...climbing, rising, exploding into the moment of climax with a strange mixture of tenderness and violence, all so vividly real...</p><p>She felt his touch on her hair, his cheek against hers. \u201cLeslie, I\u2019m afraid for you. I try, and sometimes, I find the strength to actually touch this world. But then I\u2019m drained and you\u2019re alone, and I\u2019m so afraid for you....\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d she assured him, then cuddled close and fell asleep in his arms.</p><p>She awoke suddenly, certain she could hear the sound of sobs coming from below, from the basement below the dead room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>14</p><p>A lone and awake in his car, parked just far enough away not to be conspicuous, Joe read over the list. He wished he\u2019d been there that night, and he tried to envision the scene in his mind\u2019s eye.</p><p>He kept coming back to a place where he froze, afraid.</p> <p>For Leslie.</p><p>Accident in the crypt, accident in the subway...accident in this house?</p><p>Like hell.</p><p>So if the first two weren\u2019t accidents and everything was connected, then he needed to look at the people around them now and compare those names to the list from the night of the gala. Professor Laymon? Absurd. He had no interest in anything but his work. Still, tomorrow he would assure himself that Laymon had been at the site all day.</p><p>Brad? But why?</p> <p>Jealousy?</p><p>Robert Adair had been the one to put him on the case, which seemed to rule him out. Hank Smith? He hated the guy, but that was no reason to suspect him.</p><p>And no reason not to.</p><p>Was Genevieve the connecting factor?</p><p>Or was it Leslie herself? What if someone had actually been trying to kill Leslie, not Matt?</p><p>It made no sense. But the idea continued to plague him.</p> <p>What about Ken Dryer? He was at the site far more often than a police spokesman needed to be, even with Laymon making demands and everyone trying to bow to his wishes, since the women behind him and the Historical Society were some of the wealthiest in the state.</p><p>Hank Smith. Ken Dryer. Brad Verdun. Laymon. Robert Adair. They\u2019d all been at the gala. and now they were all revolving in the same social circle again.</p><p>He set down his list, startled, as he saw lights go on in the house. He sat for a moment, then hurriedly turned off his dome light and exited his car. As he did so, he noticed something that he hadn\u2019t seen before.</p><p>A man.</p><p>He had blended with a lamppost at first. But now, with the car light off...</p><p>The guy had been standing there all along, watching the house.</p><p>He\u2019d thought himself completely hidden. Maybe he\u2019d seen the lights go on, too, and shifted his position, the movement attracting Joe\u2019s attention.</p><p>Joe raced toward the lamppost, but the man heard him coming and shot down the street like greased lightning. Joe could run, but the guy had a head start on him. Joe chased him down one street, around the block and toward the site, where he saw a uniformed cop striding along the fence.</p> <p>\u201cHey!\u201d he called out.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d the officer said, watching calmly as Joe headed toward him.</p><p>\u201cI just chased a guy around this way. Did you see him? Did you see anyone running?\u201d</p><p>The officer looked him up and down. \u201cI didn\u2019t see anyone running, but who are you? And what are you doing chasing people at this time of night?\u201d</p><p>Joe produced his ID.</p><p>\u201cOh, hell, you\u2019re him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Matt Connolly\u2019s cousin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d The guy looked confused. \u201cI just saw your picture with a story about a sting in Vegas. Good work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Are you sure you didn\u2019t see anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Connolly, I swear to you, no one went by here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, thanks. Keep an eye out for anything suspicious, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what they pay me to do.\u201d</p><p>Joe just nodded. He\u2019d lost the guy, plain and simple, and he was irritated with himself. He was also growing alarmed. He\u2019d left the house. He\u2019d left Leslie.</p><p>He turned and headed back toward the house, running full speed as soon as he was out of the cop\u2019s sight. As he ran, he blessed whatever random bit of luck had caused Leslie to give him the alarm code that day.</p><p>As soon as he reached the door, he punched it in quickly, terrified of what he might find on the other side.</p><p>There were no doubt plenty of people who would certify her as stark raving mad without question. She was in a reputedly haunted house, all alone, in the dead of night. And she wasn\u2019t content to stay safely in her room.</p><p>No, she just had to head down to the basement, where there were still bones interred in the wall.</p><p>Wide awake, wearing slippers and a robe, she took one of the lanterns from the kitchen table and went back to the servants\u2019 pantry. She lifted the braid rug, then the hatch door.</p><p>For a moment, even she hesitated. The stairs looked as if they led to a giant and eternal black abyss.</p><p>But she was certain that she had heard sobbing, a sobbing that tore at her heart.</p><p>She held the lantern out before her and started down the steps. The room began to fill with a diffuse light as she approached the bottom of the steps.</p><p>She could see Elizabeth\u2019s bones in the wall, but they didn\u2019t frighten her at all. She knew in her heart that she was doing everything she could for Elizabeth.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t afraid of ghosts, she realized.</p><p>She was afraid of the living.</p><p>She reached the bottom of the steps and walked into the center of the room. There was silence for the longest time, but then she heard it again. Sobbing. But try as she might, she couldn\u2019t ascertain where it was coming from. The sound faded before she could figure it out.</p><p>Then, to her astonishment, she heard something else. Footsteps, then two bangs. A door being opened and closed?</p><p>And then...</p><p>Silence.</p><p>She waited, not breathing. But still, she could hear nothing at all.</p><p>Elizabeth\u2019s empty-eyed skull stared at her in the strange lamplight.</p><p>Then she heard footsteps above her and froze.</p><p>\u201cLeslie?\u201d</p><p>She exhaled at last. It was Joe.</p><p>\u201cDown here!\u201d she called to him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re back in the basement?\u201d He sound incredulous. In a moment, he joined her.</p><p>\u201cJoe, what are you doing here?\u201d she asked, trembling.</p><p>\u201cI saw the lights go on.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cGod, I\u2019m sorry. I never meant to alarm you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing in the basement\u2014now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard crying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrying?\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth, suddenly not knowing what to say. She didn\u2019t want him to know that she was convinced she was hearing the heartfelt sobs of a ghost. He was beginning to trust in her, but...</p><p>\u201cI thought I heard something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you came down here alone?\u201d His tone was harsh, but he seemed to be trembling a little himself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell am I going to do with you?\u201d he demanded. He walked forward, grabbed her shoulders and pulled her against his chest. \u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoe, it\u2019s okay. You can\u2019t get to the basement except through the house.\u201d</p><p>He was silent.</p><p>\u201cJoe?\u201d She pulled slightly away.</p><p>He looked down at her. \u201cLeslie, someone was out there watching the house,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She looked up at him in alarm.</p><p>\u201cI chased him, but he got away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I knew, I\u2019d have every cop in the city on his tail.\u201d</p><p>She had to smile at that. \u201cJoe, I\u2019m not sure we can have someone arrested for watching the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here, shall we?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She nodded, heading up the stairs, with him in her wake. There was no sense in trying to get him to stay down there with her. Whatever she had been hearing, it had stopped, at least for now.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to stay in the servants\u2019 pantry, either. She quickly walked back into the main kitchen. Joe followed her.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it, anyway?\u201d she asked. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m so sorry. You\u2019re sleeping in your car to begin with, and then this. You must think I\u2019m trying to torture you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, it\u2019s not,\u201d she murmured. \u201cIt\u2019s five...pretty early, huh?\u201d It was, and she was exhausted.</p><p>\u201cJoe, there\u2019s another room upstairs that they keep for the Historical Society workers\u2014it doesn\u2019t open to the public. It\u2019s all made up. Why don\u2019t you try to grab a few hours\u2019 sleep? I\u2019ll do the same.\u201d</p><p>He arched a brow. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She smiled. \u201cI promise I won\u2019t run out on you.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cAll right. I guess it\u2019s going to be a long day tomorrow. Today. Whatever.\u201d</p><p>He followed her up to the second level, where she pointed out the door to the extra bedroom. He nodded, a smile on his lips. \u201cGood night. And lock your door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re here now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely,\u201d he teased. Then, \u201cSeriously, lock your bedroom door whenever you go to sleep, okay? Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she agreed. \u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>They went into their separate rooms. Leslie didn\u2019t think she would be able to sleep. Then she prayed that she would.</p><p>She did.</p><p>Sadly, she didn\u2019t dream. And she only woke up a few hours later because the morning light was streaming in on her face and there was activity below.</p><p>She flew out of bed. Wrapped in her robe, barefoot, she walked out to the landing. Melissa was there, along with Professor Laymon, Brad and several grad students walking in carrying wooden crates.</p><p>\u201cHey there, sleepyhead,\u201d Brad called up at her cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d Melissa said. She winked, then hurried halfway up the stairs as the others returned to the task of taking equipment toward the back of the house. \u201cHe\u2019s gone,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Melissa winked again. \u201cDon\u2019t worry\u2014your secret is safe with me. I looked for his car, and he\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...you mean Joe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMelissa, he was in the extra bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. But it\u2019s okay. My lips are sealed, I swear.\u201d She mimed zipping her lips.</p><p>Leslie rolled her eyes, then headed back to her room to shower and dress.</p><p>By the time she headed downstairs, she was greeted by an astounding surprise. For a moment she couldn\u2019t imagine who the tall white-haired man and slim blond woman talking to Professor Laymon might be. Then, while she was still halfway up the stairs, she recognized them. \u201cAdam! Nikki!\u201d she cried with pleasure. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nikki turned, her delicate features forming an instant smile. Adam had his calm, fatherly look in place.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know who to hug first. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re here. Why are you here?\u201d she demanded, hugging them each twice for good measure.</p><p>\u201cI guess you three really are old friends,\u201d Professor Laymon said dryly. \u201cI\u2019ve been telling them about the remains in the basement,\u201d he went on, then looked pointedly at his watch. \u201cYou are working today, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she assured him. \u201cYou\u2019re not just dropping by and leaving, are you?\u201d she asked, looking from Adam to Nikki. \u201cAnd where\u2019s Brent?\u201d she asked Nikki.</p><p>\u201cHe couldn\u2019t come. He\u2019s out in Los Angeles at the moment. Adam told me he was coming up here, so I decided to join him,\u201d Nikki said. \u201cI\u2019m meeting Brent out west, but I have tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving in the morning for London, but I\u2019m here tonight, too,\u201d Adam assured her.</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t call, so I assume things are going well,\u201d Nikki said.</p> <p>\u201cGoing well? She\u2019s incredible,\u201d Laymon said. \u201cShe found a crypt that could have taken us forever to uncover. I\u2019ve been champing at the bit to explore it, quite honestly. A ceiling came down almost immediately, but the workmen have shored everything up now. But, leave it to Leslie, she\u2019s gone and found more bones here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery discovery is an important one,\u201d Nikki said.</p><p>\u201cWell, in this case, I\u2019m trying very hard to see that the lady is given a proper Episcopalian burial,\u201d Leslie said.</p><p>\u201cHave you done anything in that direction yet?\u201d Adam asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019m sure we won\u2019t have any problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have an old friend in the church,\u201d Adam said. \u201cI can cut through some of the red tape for you, since I take it you don\u2019t want her sent out of the city?\u201d</p> <p>Leslie smiled at Adam. The man was a veritable miracle worker.</p><p>\u201cHey, maybe we could move this along some,\u201d Brad said, walking over to join the conversation.</p><p>As the introductions were made, Brad kept looking at the two newcomers strangely. \u201cI\u2019ve met you before,\u201d he told Adam. \u201cYou were at the hospital last year, when Leslie...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I was. Good to actually meet you,\u201d Adam said, shaking Brad\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you guys take a tour of this place this morning, then grab some lunch, and I\u2019ll be back by late afternoon,\u201d Leslie suggested to Adam and Nikki.</p><p>\u201cI love tours,\u201d Nikki said.</p><p>\u201cShe gives ghost tours in New Orleans,\u201d Leslie explained.</p><p>\u201cI thought she worked for Mr. Harrison,\u201d Brad said.</p> <p>\u201cI do research. Adam has researchers working all over the country,\u201d Nikki said.</p><p>Brad continued to look suspicious, and Leslie decided that he must be feeling proprietorial. A half hour earlier, he would have been certain he knew all her friends, and she suspected he wasn\u2019t enjoying knowing he\u2019d been wrong.</p><p>That guess proved to be correct. Down in the basement, the crates were ready, the tool boxes were open, and work had begun. Time had taken its bitter toll on the remains. Laymon had already given her a speech about how the removal of the bones should have been videotaped, but out of respect for her feelings, he had decided not to allow filming in the basement until after the remains had been taken away. After Nikki thanked him, he left to go back to the work he considered important, exploring the crypt. Leslie and Brad were busy at the delicate work of preparing the skeleton for removal. Down here, conditions hadn\u2019t been kind. There were a few patches of hair on the skull and a few bits of fabric so blackened by time that they were barely identifiable as cotton.</p><p>\u201cAre we test-tubing anything?\u201d Brad asked her.</p><p>\u201cNo. Let\u2019s just get her a real burial. Please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, someone with more power could step in on top of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a feeling they won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of your friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdam, you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is that guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn old friend.\u201d Well, Adam was old, even if she hadn\u2019t actually known him all that long.</p><p>\u201cI see. He has that air about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat air?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a guy who speaks softly but somehow everyone knows he\u2019s carrying a really big stick.\u201d</p><p>Leslie shrugged. \u201cHe owns his own company, and he\u2019s done work for the government.\u201d</p><p>Brad laughed. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t look like an assassin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because he\u2019s not an assassin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what does he do for the government?\u201d</p><p>\u201cResearch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of research?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHistorical, of course. Hand me that brush, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re evading me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you the honest-to-God truth,\u201d she vowed.</p><p>He held the brush for a minute, looking at her suspiciously, before finally handing it over.</p><p>A few minutes later, as they worked in silence, Brad gasped.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2014on the floor.\u201d He bent down to take a closer look. \u201cI take it you won\u2019t mind if we have this tested?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThe shot that killed her,\u201d Brad said softly.</p><p>When Joe got to the site he was glad to find out that Laymon and Brad had already gone on to Hastings House to oversee the removal of the bones by the basement hearth. He didn\u2019t want to see either one of them.</p><p>One of the workers directed him to the guard who had been on duty at the gate the day before. He remembered seeing Laymon early in the morning and Brad late in the afternoon.</p><p>He went on to question the grad students. They, too, had seen Laymon early and Brad late.</p><p>\u201cHow about Hank Smith? Was he around yesterday?\u201d Joe asked two of the students, a married couple in their early thirties who had met as undergrads on a dig. It had been a life of digging in the dirt for the two of them ever since.</p><p>\u201cCalvin Klein, you mean?\u201d the husband asked with a grin. \u201cThe guy with the suits?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hangs around here a lot,\u201d the wife said. \u201cWell, he hangs around for a while, goes to his trailer, comes out, hangs around...who knows what he does?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut was he around yesterday?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>They looked at each other, thinking. \u201cI get busy with a dig, and...\u201d The husband lifted his hands apologetically.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d the wife said decisively. \u201cI know I didn\u2019t see him. I actually look for him every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWendy!\u201d her husband said, surprised and hurt.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s his clothes, Cal. I love to see what he\u2019s going to wear next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere any of the cops around yesterday?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>They both stared at him. Cal cleared his throat. \u201cTake a look around. There are always a ton of cops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking of Robert Adair, older guy, heavy, but all muscle. And the good-looking one who does the public speaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see either of them?\u201d Wendy asked Cal.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Cal said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure about the older guy, but I didn\u2019t see the good-looking one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cI would have noticed,\u201d Wendy said.</p><p>\u201cOh, so it\u2019s not just the clothes?\u201d Cal asked wryly.</p><p>Joe left them to their friendly bickering and went on, still trying to put the pieces together in his mind.</p><p>Leslie was anxious about how Elizabeth\u2019s bones were being treated, but she was equally anxious to spend time alone with Adam and Nikki. For now, though, there was nothing more she could do for the evening. The bones were safely crated, and she and Brad had secured some of the fabric and surrounding earth for testing. In the morning, they would have to make a trip to the morgue, but once the remains were officially aged, Elizabeth could take her place in hallowed ground.</p><p>Leslie tried hard not to be rude to Brad, though she was aware that he was angling for an invitation to join her and her friends. She gave him a quick hug. \u201cFinish up with the tools, will you, please? I want to spend as much time as I can in with Adam and Nikki, and they both have to leave tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. You guys going barhopping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re a sedate crowd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s pretty cute to be sedate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s married. Happily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d he said. Then, \u201cI\u2019m teasing!\u201d he added when she stared at him. He let out a sigh. \u201cGo on. Have fun. I\u2019ll finish here.\u201d</p><p>She ran up the stairs, realizing that the basement had held no eerie mysteries all during the day. She hadn\u2019t heard or felt anything. Did that simply mean that she had been letting her imagination run wild? Was she inventing half of what she had been told was a \u201ctalent\u201d? Or maybe her mind had been so filled with the present today that she hadn\u2019t had time to dwell on the past.</p><p>She could hear two tours going on. Tandy was in the parlor, while Jeff had moved on to the dining room. She quickly popped her head into each room to see if Adam and Nikki were there, but there was no sign of them. She headed upstairs to her room. As she got ready to hit the shower, she remembered that she hadn\u2019t spoken with Joe all day. She hesitated. She desperately wanted to speak with Nikki alone; she needed to ask her why she couldn\u2019t communicate with Matt when she was awake. But she also felt she had to call Joe, given his concern for her welfare. And, whether it was because he was Matt\u2019s cousin or not, she felt an affinity for him, as if she had known him, been close to him, for years, rather than just days.</p><p>She called Joe, but he didn\u2019t pick up. She left him a hasty message, telling him friends had unexpectedly showed up in town and she would be out with them, but to please call her cell when he could. She tried Nikki then, and Nikki did pick up. \u201cWe\u2019re just down by City Hall, but we\u2019ll head back now. Oh, and Adam saw his friend Father Behan. Burial is all set, just as soon as the remains are cleared.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPerfect, thanks. See you soon.\u201d</p><p>She jumped into shower, then paused. The house seemed so...empty. There had to be at least fifty people downstairs, and yet she felt...</p><p>As if the house was quiet. As if it were silent, watching, waiting....</p> <p>\u201cMatt?\u201d she whispered. He wouldn\u2019t leave her. He would trust her. If he could, he would come to her. But she had no sensation of him being near.</p><p>Thank God she would be able to explain some of what was going on with her now, and to people who wouldn\u2019t immediately jump to the conclusion that she had become delusional in the wake of her loss.</p><p>The thought made her feel cheerful as she dressed in heels and a knit halter dress, then threw an embroidered shawl over her shoulders. When she went to transfer her essentials into a dressier handbag than she usually used, she saw that there was a message on her phone.</p><p>It was Joe. He wanted her to call and tell him where they would be, and said he would join them at some point during the evening.</p><p>By the time she went downstairs, the tours were gone, Melissa was getting ready to leave, and Adam and Nikki were waiting in the hall.</p> <p>Melissa, like Brad, looked as if she would like an invitation to hang around. Normally, Leslie would have asked her to join them at least for a drink, but not tonight. She was too desperate to spill her guts to her friends. \u201cI\u2019ll get the doughnuts tomorrow morning,\u201d she told Melissa in answer to her hopeful look.</p><p>\u201cOkay...cool. I\u2019ll be in early, like usual. Will I see you two again?\u201d she asked Adam and Nikki, trying to hide her disappointment at being excluded.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to be at the airport until around ten or eleven,\u201d Adam said, smiling. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll see you in the morning. Good night.\u201d</p><p>At last Melissa was gone, and the alarm had been set, and Leslie spun around on the stairs to face her friends. \u201cI\u2019m so glad to see you guys!\u201d she exploded.</p><p>\u201cWas it a mistake to come back here?\u201d Nikki asked gently.</p><p>\u201cNo...no, I would never say that, but...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs Matt here?\u201d Adam asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. And no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we find a place to eat and you can tell us all about it?\u201d Nikki asked.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a great pub around the corner, O\u2019Malley\u2019s. It\u2019s been there since before I first came to New York,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>\u201cSounds good to me. There\u2019s...a lot to tell,\u201d Leslie said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got all night,\u201d Nikki said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know where to begin,\u201d Leslie said.</p><p>\u201cStart with your arrival,\u201d Adam said. \u201cWe can talk as we walk.\u201d</p> <p>On the way back to his car, Joe realized with a touch of anxiety that there were no messages on his phone. He\u2019d thought he\u2019d simply missed Leslie\u2019s call while he was out of cell range down in the crypt, but it looked as if she hadn\u2019t called him back at all.</p><p>His association with her had apparently given him free access to the site, so he\u2019d decided it wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea to check out the work being done in the crypt for himself, just to make sure there wouldn\u2019t be any more \u201caccidents\u201d of any kind down there. He wondered how happy Laymon would have been to find out that the people working the find considered it to be far more Leslie\u2019s dig than his. He was certain Laymon wouldn\u2019t appreciate the fact that he was prowling around on his own.</p><p>The crypt yielded no clues to anything, though he stood there just looking around for a long time. While he stood there, he found himself talking aloud to his dead cousin again. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here, Matt? What the hell am I looking for?\u201d</p><p>Damn it, Joe, don\u2019t you think I\u2019d be doing more if I knew? It\u2019s a mystery to me, too. It has something to do with what\u2019s happening underground, I know that much. I mean, that room where I died is right over the basement, and there are bones in the basement...Watch out for her, Joe.</p><p>Was that his own wishful thinking talking? Yeah, Matt, give me your blessing. She was the love of your life, and she\u2019s still in love with you, but I\u2019ve got to be near her, at least. And I hope to God I\u2019m helping.</p><p>After a while he decided he\u2019d spent too much time by himself in a hole in the earth carrying on an imaginary conversation with his dead cousin, so he left and headed for his car. Once there, he looked at his watch, thought about what traffic was going to be like, swore and decided on the subway. As he was waiting on the platform, he found himself deep in thought again. He couldn\u2019t guarantee yesterday\u2019s whereabouts of any of the men who were becoming suspects in his mind. To imagine that any one of them could be an unbelievably crafty killer was beyond imagination. And yet, he was convinced that the missing hookers, the missing heiress and the explosion were all connected and that all he had to do was get the dots connected in the right order. He considered the possibilities as he stepped onto the train and grabbed the pole for support. The cops: Ken Dryer and Robert Adair. He\u2019d known Robert forever, and it was Robert who\u2019d connected him with Eileen Brideswell. Robert was a good old nose-to-the-pavement detective. Dryer was a peacock. Good at his job, though, a job that took him all over the city. The others: Hank Smith...the builder. He would know a lot about basements. Laymon. Seriously, did the man ever think about anything other than his work? Then again, maybe still waters ran deep, as the saying went. Laymon was so dedicated during his working hours that maybe he went off like dynamite when he wasn\u2019t digging. And Brad. Both Brad and Laymon had been working in Virginia when several of the disappearances had occurred. But the distance from New York wasn\u2019t that great.</p><p>The subway rattled on, the lights occasionally blinking off, then back on. They were deep underground. You had to love Manhattan. What it couldn\u2019t supply above\u2014speedy transportation\u2014it did beneath. Dark, damp and deserted, the tunnels down here seemed to stretch forever.</p><p>Had it been an accident when Leslie was pitched onto the tracks? It was actually surprising that things like that didn\u2019t happen more often than they did. So many people, a wave of humanity. The only way it could have been intentional was if someone had been following her. And he hadn\u2019t been able to clear any of his suspects; none of them had been at the dig.</p><p>So Leslie was very likely a target now, he thought.</p><p>What if she\u2019d been the actual target all along, not Matt?</p><p>But why?</p><p>Because she had an eerie ability to find human remains.</p><p>He reached his stop and made his way up through the crowds to the street, then the photo shop on Christopher Street. The storefront was simple, with cameras on display. It was narrow and looked like a hole-in-the-wall, but it stretched back forever. Cops and P.I.s used Harry constantly; he had a unique way with photos, no matter what their source.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Harry said, seeing him when he entered. He had been helping an elderly lady with her cat photos, and while she was busy oohing and aahing, Harry was able to excuse himself. \u201cJoe. How are you?\u201d</p><p>Harry pumped his hand. Harry always reminded Joe of Dr. Bunsen Honeydew from the Muppets. He had a thatch of white hair that stood straight out to all sides, huge glasses, and was impossibly tall and thin. And he always wore a lab coat.</p><p>\u201cDid you find anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. It would\u2019ve been easier with a digital image, but I\u2019ve been playing with it. Come on back and I\u2019ll show you what I\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>Harry led Joe along a narrow hallway to the rooms behind the public area. They entered an office to the left.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve run off a few copies for you,\u201d Harry explained, sitting down at his computer. \u201cBut I thought you might want to see it on screen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Harry hit a button, and the photo popped up. There was Genevieve, her beautiful eyes wide and her arm around Betty.</p><p>The man was a bit to the side. Had he actually been with them? Or had he simply been caught in the photo?</p><p>No photographic manipulation in the world could change the fact that he hadn\u2019t been facing the camera. But with the shot blown up and enhanced, Joe was able to get a sense of the man\u2019s profile. He stared for a minute, sensing that he should know who it was but unable to make an ID.</p><p>Then he swore softly.</p><p>\u201cDid I help?\u201d Harry asked.</p><p>\u201cYou bet,\u201d Joe told him, his heart racing. \u201cSon of a bitch, you bet.\u201d</p><p>15</p><p>E ven though she was the one who might be in trouble, Leslie had to find out how Nikki and Adam were doing\u2014she couldn\u2019t help it. She was curious about her friends. But Nikki, sensing that Leslie had something on her mind, quickly steered her back to her own situation. But though she loved Adam, she realized that she just couldn\u2019t quite explain everything that had been happening, not to him. She merely said that Matt had been coming into her dreams, even though he hadn\u2019t made contact in any other way. She also talked about the \u201caccidents,\u201d and she tried to explain Joe and the fact that he was so much like Matt...and yet not like Matt at all.</p><p>The hardest thing to explain, actually, was the incident on the subway platform. She\u2019d been so certain that she\u2019d seen Matt there at first, urging her to move, and yet, it had been Joe who pulled her out.</p><p>\u201cAccidents,\u201d Adam murmured.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you should get out of here,\u201d Nikki said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of ghosts.\u201d</p><p>Nikki smiled. \u201cWell, we\u2019ve both had the opportunity to learn that it\u2019s the living who are the most dangerous.\u201d</p><p>Leslie nodded; Nikki had voiced her own thoughts.</p><p>\u201cAnd then,\u201d Leslie said, \u201cthere are the prostitutes who\u2019ve gone missing, along with a young social worker who knew some of them and is also missing. Plus there\u2019s a good possibility that the explosion that killed Matt and almost killed me may not have been an accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother good reason for you to leave,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>\u201cAnd another good reason for me to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause...?\u201d Nikki prompted.</p><p>\u201cBecause I think I may be here because I can somehow help. There are ghosts in the house. I saw and spoke with Elizabeth\u2014and Matt was the one who told me she needed help.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a Civil War soldier in the entry, too,\u201d Nikki said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve seen him?\u201d Leslie asked.</p><p>\u201cBriefly. He seemed like quite the gentleman,\u201d Nikki informed her.</p> <p>\u201cReally? I would love to meet him,\u201d Leslie said.</p><p>Nikki smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve been at this a little longer than you. The first time I realized I was actually seeing a ghost...I thought I\u2019d die of shock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI pretty much thought I should be locked up,\u201d Leslie murmured. \u201cExcept that...well, I think I was with Matt. That I almost stayed with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was when you really had to admit that you see what other\u2019s can\u2019t,\u201d Adam said gently. \u201cWhat even I can\u2019t,\u201d he added wistfully.</p><p>Nikki set a hand on Leslie\u2019s arm. \u201cShould you really be staying at that house alone?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cWild horses wouldn\u2019t drag me out of it,\u201d Leslie said. \u201cAnd last night Joe stayed in the extra room. It was just for the one night, but I can ask him to stay from now on. You know...you guys should stay tonight. Please? You may...see something I can\u2019t. I guess you checked into a hotel, but...\u201d</p><p>Adam waved a dismissive hand. \u201cWe can check out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s also something I\u2019d love your help with tomorrow if you have time before your flights,\u201d she said. She went on to describe the little girl at the dig. \u201cHer name is Mary, but I don\u2019t know her last name, and there are so many Marys listed in the church register. I haven\u2019t seen her again, but I feel that it\u2019s urgent to reunite her with her mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best,\u201d Nikki told her. \u201cI wish Brent was here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Leslie can fix things,\u201d Adam said reassuringly.</p><p>Leslie started to speak, but then she realized that she\u2019d been staring at a woman sitting alone in a booth across the room from them. Apparently the waitresses all knew her. Whenever they stopped by to refill her coffee cup, they all had something to say.</p> <p>\u201cDo you see someone you know? Have you been here before?\u201d Nikki asked her.</p><p>\u201cNo. And, yes. I came here once with Matt.\u201d</p><p>Nikki and Adam subtly checked out the woman Leslie had been studying. \u201cThat\u2019s Eileen Brideswell,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Leslie murmured, wondering why she hadn\u2019t recognized the woman. Not only had she seen her before, she\u2019d even met her. Eileen Brideswell had been at the Hastings House gala the night of the explosion.</p><p>She looked exceedingly sad, though she tried to smile when waitresses talked to her. As soon as they left, though, the smile faded.</p><p>\u201cYou know her?\u201d Leslie asked Adam.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve met her over the years. In fact, excuse me, if you will.\u201d</p><p>He left them, joining Eileen, who brightened at his appearance. He sat down opposite her, and they began to talk.</p> <p>Leslie looked at Nikki. \u201cI think I really am going crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve all felt that way,\u201d Nikki assured her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m seeing ghosts. It\u2019s...\u201d She hesitated. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I love Adam like a father, but I couldn\u2019t talk about this in front of him. Nikki, Matt doesn\u2019t just talk to me in my dreams. It\u2019s as if we\u2019re together again. Nikki, I\u2019m having this wild sex life...with a ghost.\u201d</p><p>Nikki twirled her swizzle stick in her Irish coffee. Then she looked at Leslie. \u201cWe see ghosts,\u201d she said softly. \u201cDo we really know anything about them? No. Josh, Adam\u2019s son...you know he died at eighteen. He immediately appeared to his best friend, who told Adam. And even though Adam can\u2019t see him, Josh often travels with him, and he speaks to a lot of people. I think maybe being a ghost is...well, not that different from being alive, in a way. If we\u2019re energy, then for a ghost, that energy remains and is like a brand-new life. Perhaps most people do just go on to whatever the afterlife is. But some stay for months or years, even centuries, because they feel they have to remain on earth for some reason, that they have a function here. So take a man like Matt. From what you\u2019ve told me, he was someone who believed in what he could see and touch. So I bet it\u2019s difficult for him to learn the ropes, so to speak. Even more difficult than it is for most ghosts. Maybe he figured out how to enter your dreams, while it\u2019s still difficult for him to...well, materialize, for want of a better word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...when I see him in my dreams, it may not just be what I want more than anything in the world?\u201d Leslie asked.</p><p>\u201cI wish I had all the answers, but I don\u2019t.\u201d She smiled. \u201cI could be way off. Like I said, none of us has all the answers, and we\u2019re all surprised on a daily basis. But think about all the examples of ESP you\u2019ve heard about. A mother knowing when her child is in danger. A wife knowing suddenly that her husband has been killed. Maybe, living or dead, we all have the power to connect with that energy somehow. We just have to learn to use it. Maybe, sometimes, people live when they should have died, and maybe, sometimes, people have died when they should have lived, but there\u2019s still a trail of communication. You and I both know other people who see ghosts, but think about it\u2014this is New York, home to millions of people. And how many of those do you think see ghosts? Then again, ghosts can come in different ways. I had a friend who lost her dad when she was really young, and it nearly destroyed her. Then she had a dream about him, and he kept telling her how well he was doing, and how she needed to be happy, move on. And after that, she felt the pain, but she...adjusted, I guess. Who\u2019s to say she didn\u2019t see a ghost, that her dad didn\u2019t find a way to make life livable again for her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, that\u2019s a nice thought,\u201d Leslie murmured. \u201cI just wish I knew what to do from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure exactly how you mean that, but I don\u2019t think you can do anything, not emotionally, until...well, until whatever is going on is solved. I think Adam is about to cancel his trip to stay with you. He\u2019s worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat incident in the crypt? That fall in the subway? Do you really think those were accidents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ll be careful now,\u201d Leslie vowed. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll have Joe stay at Hastings House.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cNikki, I\u2019m certain that I\u2019m on to something. I keep thinking about tunnels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd have you found a tunnel\u2014or a solution?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not yet.\u201d</p><p>Nikki studied her. \u201cLeslie, Adam and I think you\u2019re in danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m around people all day, and Joe is around, too, even at night. Just not exactly with me.\u201d</p><p>Nikki lowered her head, then looked up at her again, a twinkle in her eye. \u201cFace it. You don\u2019t want Joe to stay\u2014even though I can tell you really like him, because you\u2019re afraid that if he\u2019s there, Matt won\u2019t show up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Leslie admitted.</p><p>Nikki squeezed her hand. \u201cMatt loved and trusted you. He trusted and loved his cousin. I\u2019m willing to bet Matt would be a happier man if he knew you were safe.\u201d</p><p>Leslie\u2019s cell phone suddenly started ringing. Saved by the bell, she thought wryly, and excused herself to answer it, knowing from caller ID that it was Joe.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cO\u2019Malley\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you with?\u201d He sounded tense.</p><p>\u201cAdam and Nikki. Why? What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way,\u201d Joe said, and hung up. She closed her phone just as Nikki came back to their booth, leading Eileen Brideswell.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Eileen said shyly.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Brideswell, how are you?\u201d Leslie asked. Bad question. The woman obviously wasn\u2019t doing well. But it was the polite thing to say.</p><p>\u201cI gather you\u2019ve met Leslie MacIntyre, Eileen,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Eileen replied, smiling.</p><p>\u201cAnd this is my colleague, Nikki Blackhawk,\u201d Adam continued.</p><p>\u201cHow do you do,\u201d Nikki said, smiling warmly.</p><p>\u201cThank you for inviting me to join you,\u201d Eileen said. The words were sincere. Given her power and position, Eileen could have dinner with the city\u2019s most elite residents, but Leslie thought she understood the other woman. She didn\u2019t want to be surrounded by the wealthy and powerful, forced to smile and nod and talk about the important events of the day. She wanted to be alone with her thoughts. But joining them was different.</p><p>\u201cI think we share a friend,\u201d Eileen said, sliding into the booth across from Leslie.</p><p>\u201cJoe? I know he\u2019s working for you,\u201d Leslie said.</p><p>Eileen nodded.</p><p>\u201cHe will find out what happened to Genevieve, you know.\u201d Leslie reached across the table and laid her hand over Eileen\u2019s in a gesture of assurance as she spoke.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t prepared for what happened next.</p><p>Her vision seemed to disappear, not in darkness, but in a flash of light. She didn\u2019t see Eileen\u2019s inner soul or her past; she saw Genevieve.</p><p>The other woman was standing in a black abyss, and it was damp and cold.</p><p>Like a grave.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t dead.</p><p>Her hair was twisted away from her face, knotted at her nape. She was thin and haggard-looking, but she was at work, her hands busy as she tore at something unseen. She worked and worked and worked....</p><p>And then gave way to exhaustion, falling to her knees, sobbing.</p><p>Leslie drew her hand back as the vision faded to total blackness.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, dear?\u201d Eileen Brideswell asked. \u201cYou look as if you\u2019ve seen a ghost.\u201d</p><p>Leslie forced a smile. Not a ghost. A living woman. Genevieve.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t say that. Eileen would think that she was insane. Worse. That she was offering her false hope, playing on her emotions.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should see a doctor,\u201d Eileen said. \u201cI saw on the news that you were in an accident at the dig when the roof gave way, and then I heard about that dreadful incident on the subway.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Honestly,\u201d Leslie said. \u201cBut thank you so much for your concern.\u201d She saw the pub door open and Joe walk in. He was scanning the room, looking for her. She could see the light reflect off his hair. Light, but not as blond as Matt\u2019s. No, he was darker. His eyes were a quicksilver shade between blue and green. Matt\u2019s had been such a piercing color; they had seemed to go from the color of the sky to indigo.</p><p>What the hell was she doing?</p><p>He strode over the table, seeming to note without surprise that Eileen was there, too, before he reached them. Leslie quickly introduced Joe to Nikki and Adam, who rose to shake his hand. She knew that Joe was assessing them warily, and that he would remain wary until he had spent more time with them.</p> <p>\u201cMrs. Brideswell,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cJoe, I\u2019m glad to see you.\u201d She tried to be casual, but her voice was anxious.</p><p>Joe looked unhappy. Leslie knew he was desperately wishing he had something concrete to tell her, even though she wouldn\u2019t come right out in this company and ask him how he was progressing. She tilted her head questioningly, and there was so much hope in that small gesture.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019re coming along,\u201d Joe said softly.</p><p>\u201cReally? Can you come see me tomorrow morning and tell me how things are going?\u201d she asked him.</p> <p>He hesitated.</p><p>Adam said, \u201cNikki and I will be with Leslie tonight, and we\u2019ll be with her tomorrow morning at the dig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. How about nine?\u201d Joe suggested.</p><p>\u201cRight here,\u201d Eileen said. She smiled self-consciously. \u201cThis place is my comfort zone. And it\u2019s the only pub I know that opens for breakfast. Good business, though, with everyone who works downtown.\u201d</p><p>Joe slid into the booth next to Leslie. She could feel the tension in his body.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>He shook his head, forcing a smile. \u201cLater,\u201d he murmured. Then, louder, \u201cIt\u2019s great to meet some of Leslie\u2019s friends. Are you both archaeologists, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHistorian,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>\u201cAnd I run a company that leads ghost tours in New Orleans,\u201d Nikki said.</p><p>\u201cGhost tours?\u201d Joe said. \u201cInteresting. How\u2019s the city doing? I\u2019ve heard a lot of people still haven\u2019t moved back.\u201d</p><p>Joe, Leslie realized, intended to talk about anything but what was going on. Eileen Brideswell was watching him, a slight frown creasing her brow, but she seemed equally glad not to be discussing matters that tore at her heart.</p><p>Joe, however casual he pretended to be, remained tense throughout the meal, watching the door.</p><p>\u201cAre we being joined by anyone else?\u201d he asked Leslie at one point.</p><p>She shook her head.</p> <p>\u201cYour work buddies are elsewhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrad and I finished in the basement, and I don\u2019t know where anyone went after that. Actually, I was in a hurry to leave. Nikki and Adam aren\u2019t here for very long.\u201d She gave him a broad smile. \u201cAt least tonight you can go home and get some sleep. I won\u2019t be alone.\u201d</p><p>He accepted that, though he didn\u2019t seem to be much happier. He went on to ask Adam if he was also from New Orleans.</p><p>\u201cAdam owns a company in Virginia called Harrison Investigations,\u201d Eileen inserted.</p><p>Leslie fought hard to keep her eyebrows from shooting up. Did Eileen know exactly what Adam did?</p><p>\u201cI see. Historical investigations?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>Leslie lowered her head, smiling. She was coming to know Joe. By tomorrow, he would know everything about Adam, Nikki and Harrison Investigations.</p><p>At last the evening ended. They waited on the sidewalk with Eileen while her driver brought the car around, and then they started walking back to Hastings House. Leslie pulled back a bit, linking her arm through Joe\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He looked down at her. \u201cTell me more about what you were doing in Virginia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVirginia. When you were working down there. You left New York City after you were released from the hospital, and you started working in Virginia. Were you working with Laymon and Brad from the beginning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It was Laymon\u2019s project. He approached Brad, and Brad approached me. Where is this going, Joe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe work was intense?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe worked fairly intensely, yes, but it was that kind of dig, a major project. An entire burial ground, an old churchyard. We made all kinds of finds. Civil War weapons and bullets, canteens...and Revolutionary artifacts, as well. It was slow-going, because there were so many separate layers to sift through. Which we\u2019ll find here, too, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you take days off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. No one works endlessly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you have weekends off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepending on what was going on. Joe, please, what are you getting at?\u201d</p><p>They had reached the house; Adam and Nikki were waiting politely ahead on the sidewalk.</p><p>\u201cYou can say anything in front of them,\u201d Leslie said. \u201cTrust me, Adam has had government contracts that far outweigh our problems.\u201d</p><p>Joe stared at her for a minute, then reached into his jacket pocket. He unfolded a large color photograph.</p><p>She frowned at him, then looked at the photo. She instantly recognized Genevieve O\u2019Brien, and her heart fluttered. She hadn\u2019t said anything to Eileen or anyone else about the image that had sprung into her mind when she had touched Eileen\u2019s hand, but now...seeing Genevieve\u2019s face, she felt a swell of empathy. She\u2019s alive and she\u2019s suffering, but she\u2019s fighting. She\u2019ll never give up, never.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Genevieve,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know who the other woman is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA prostitute\u2014one of the women who disappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who is the man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook closely, Leslie.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t complain that the light wasn\u2019t good, because they were standing directly under a street lamp. She stared at the photo, then gasped. She stared back at Joe.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Brad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s an explanation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever it is, I intend to get it from him,\u201d he said firmly.</p><p>She shook her head uncomfortably, suddenly aware that Adam and Nikki had walked over to stand by them and were looking at the photo, too. \u201cThis is Eileen\u2019s niece.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGenevieve, yes,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>\u201cAnd she\u2019s with your partner,\u201d Nikki added, having apparently recognized Brad more readily than Leslie herself had.</p><p>\u201cThere has to be an explanation. I mean, you can\u2019t assume someone is guilty of something just because he\u2019s in a photograph,\u201d Nikki said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s enough for me to get the police to bring him in for questioning,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>\u201cJoe, don\u2019t do that. Talk to Brad yourself first, please. It\u2019s just ridiculous to assume that he\u2019s been abducting women just because of a photograph, and even more ridiculous to think he blew up Hastings House. Or that he\u2019d try to hurt me or Matt. He\u2019s not like that, Joe. He\u2019s a good guy. Really.\u201d</p><p>Joe clearly wasn\u2019t convinced. Adam and Nikki kept silent on the subject.</p><p>Leslie set a hand on Joe\u2019s arm. \u201cPlease, go slowly with this. Don\u2019t...I don\u2019t want to create a problem while the dig is going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dig. Right,\u201d Joe said disgustedly. \u201cAmazing that a chunk of ceiling fell down just when you were there. Was Brad around when it happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told everyone. I had been in the crypt alone,\u201d Leslie said.</p><p>\u201cHad been. Who exactly was there after the collapse?\u201d Joe demanded.</p><p>She looked at him, blinking. She thought back, remembering.</p><p>\u201cA number of people\u2014including you,\u201d she said meaningfully.</p><p>\u201cI arrived later, I had to shove through a crowd to get to you. Who was there when you opened your eyes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaymon, Dryer, Adair...and Brad,\u201d she said wearily. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean anything,\u201d she added quickly. \u201cThere were dozens of workers around, too. Dozens of grad students, some of the development company people...tons of people.\u201d</p><p>He just stared at her. \u201cAll right. I\u2019m not going to bring this to the attention of the police until I have a chance to speak with Brad myself.\u201d He looked up at Adam. \u201cI\u2019m assuming you have a lot of connections in the area where Leslie, Laymon and Brad were last working. Do you think you could have some of them look into Brad Verdun\u2019s movements while he was working down there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I can manage that, yes,\u201d Adam said. There was a strange smile curving his lip. Joe might have startled him with the question, but he didn\u2019t bat an eye. Leslie could tell that he did think it ironic that Joe had apparently weighed and judged him so quickly, and that he was glad he had been approved.</p><p>\u201cSo for the moment, you\u2019re not going to turn Brad in, and you won\u2019t strong-arm him, you\u2019ll just talk to him, okay?\u201d Leslie asked.</p><p>Joe arched a brow. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019d like to, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Joe admitted.</p><p>\u201cThen how about driving Adam and Nikki to their hotel so they can check out and come stay with me instead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you? Where will you be while I\u2019m playing chauffeur?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can just wait here, at Hastings House.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way am I leaving you alone.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll come, too.\u201d</p><p>The drive was nice. The windows were down as they shot up Sixth Avenue, making for a nice breeze, and the city was beautiful by night. At the hotel, Joe left his car right in front, after tipping a young man heavily to see that it went around the block a few times and then came back.</p><p>Adam was fond of old places, so they had intended to stay at the Algonquin. Joe and Leslie sat in the comfortable lounge while they were waiting for the other two to repack and check out. He smiled at her ruefully. \u201cSo...do you see Dorothy Parker or any of her circle anywhere?\u201d he asked lightly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLook over there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLori Newman, the new Broadway sensation,\u201d Leslie said, smiling. But then she grew serious. \u201cJoe...I know this sounds strange, but I\u2019m absolutely convinced Genevieve O\u2019Brien is alive.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI feel it, too. That\u2019s exactly why I\u2019m so frustrated. I don\u2019t believe that she\u2019s going to stay alive much longer. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve got to find her soon, before he...\u201d His voice trailed off as he considered the cost of failure.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t Brad. Trust me, along with everything else, he really isn\u2019t clever enough to pull something like this off.\u201d</p><p>Joe actually smiled.</p><p>Leslie hesitated. \u201cI saw her, Joe. Tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was strange. When I touched Eileen\u2019s hand tonight...\u201d She stopped, wincing. \u201cI saw her...in a vision, I guess you\u2019d say. She was alive. But she was desperately trying to do something...escape, maybe. She had to give up. She didn\u2019t have the strength to keep going.\u201d</p><p>He just stared at her. \u201cYou...had a vision?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it was, exactly. But tonight, when I touched Eileen, it was almost as if I could reach out and touch Genevieve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf only you could,\u201d he mused softly.</p><p>\u201cMay I take that picture? The one you showed me with her\u2014and Brad\u2014in it?\u201d Leslie asked. \u201cI\u2019m sure you have other copies.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cSure.\u201d</p> <p>Adam and Nikki reappeared, and they headed outside as a group.</p><p>\u201cThink that kid is coming back with your car?\u201d Nikki teased Joe.</p><p>\u201cSure hope so.\u201d</p><p>But the young man, who in fact worked for the hotel, returned the car in less than two minutes. Traffic was light, and the drive back to Hastings House was quick.</p><p>Despite Adam and Nikki\u2019s presence, Joe came inside with them. Leslie was surprised when he walked through the house, upstairs and downstairs, then went back to the servants\u2019 pantry and down to the basement.</p><p>Adam and Nikki had already gone upstairs to get settled. Leslie waited for him in the servants\u2019 pantry. As she did, she looked around. It was amazing. If she hadn\u2019t been here herself when the room exploded into fire and splinters, she would never suspect now that any such thing had ever happened.</p><p>Joe came back up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cEmpty?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo my eyes,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>Hands on his hips, he turned away from her, staring thoughtfully at the hatch. She stood behind him, slipping her arms around him, leaning her head against his back.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, ma\u2019am, anything I can do,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>He turned. His eyes searched hers out as he lifted her chin with his thumb and forefinger. His head bent.</p><p>She thought he was going to kiss her full on the lips. She didn\u2019t know what she felt, what she would do.</p><p>But his lips landed lightly on her forehead, instead. \u201cLeslie, I\u2019m begging you, for the love of God, be careful.\u201d He backed away and looked at her. \u201cI don\u2019t get visions, but I do get hunches. And I feel nervous as hell right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear to you, I\u2019ll be careful. And don\u2019t forget, Nikki and Adam are here tonight,\u201d she said.</p><p>At last, with a last brush of his lips against her forehead, he left for the night. She keyed in the alarm after he left and headed upstairs.</p><p>Adam was in the room where Joe had slept the night before. Nikki was in her room, in a big cotton nightgown, sitting up in the queen-size bed, playing with the remote control. \u201cYou must be a real celebrity,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve just been on the news,\u201d she told Leslie.</p><p>Leslie groaned. \u201cI guess it\u2019s out that we found bones in the basement here,\u201d she said.</p><p>Nikki nodded. \u201cThere was just a shot of you and Matt dressed up for some kind of social event, then the story. Pretty low key, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d Leslie went into the bathroom to change for the night and brush her teeth. When she emerged and crawled beneath the covers, she couldn\u2019t help but think, Matt won\u2019t come tonight. I know he won\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou all right?\u201d Nikki asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019m thrilled you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Nikki smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s just for one night. And...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoe is alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you seen or felt Matt in any way?\u201d Leslie asked, feeling desperate.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry. I get hazy visions of others...but not Matt.\u201d Nikki smiled again. \u201cRemember what I said earlier. Entering your dreams might be Matt\u2019s only way to contact you. And he might want you to move on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI keep hearing that,\u201d Leslie said.</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s what you have to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do go on. I love my work. And when I can do something like bring out the truth about Elizabeth, it\u2019s wonderful.\u201d</p><p>Nikki nodded, then yawned. \u201cThe world is a mystery. That\u2019s for certain.\u201d She yawned again.</p><p>Leslie turned off the bedside lamp. \u201cMind if I watch TV?\u201d she asked Nikki. \u201cIt takes my mind off...things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo right ahead.\u201d</p><p>Despite the TV, after a little while Leslie\u2019s eyes began to fall shut.</p><p>She slept.</p><p>Someone was out there. Watching the house.</p><p>Matt felt that he should have been able to get out there. He was actually becoming more and more convinced that eventually he would be able to. When he had sensed with such certainty that Leslie was in mortal danger, the desperation of sheer will had propelled him to her. Yes, he had been there. Yes, she had seen his face. She had felt him, helping her up from the tracks.</p><p>Joe had been there, too. Joe, with his powerful, living arms. Arms that were probably the only ones he could trust her to himself. Matt couldn\u2019t stand her being alone with anyone anymore.</p><p>And soon he would be able to leave the house at will. He would reach the street lamp.</p><p>And he would see the watcher\u2019s face.</p><p>But tonight...</p><p>Tonight he was upstairs in the bedroom, watching the women sleep, quiet, beautiful. Two blondes, angelic-looking. He touched Leslie\u2019s hair with a rush of nostalgia and tenderness, and then he moved to sit on the floor, leaning against the wall, still watching.</p><p>He would stay through the night.</p><p>Leslie woke with a start.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what had roused her. Frowning, she saw that Nikki was still sleeping peacefully by her side.</p><p>It must have been something on the TV, she told herself.</p><p>She aimed the remote at the television and pushed the Off button, then lay back down and smiled wistfully.</p><p>\u201cMatt? Are you here?\u201d she breathed almost silently.</p><p>There was no answer. She thought she saw the curtain rustle; perhaps she felt a breeze. Maybe it was only because she was tired and so desperately hopeful, but in that whisper of movement she felt enfolded by love. Tenderness.</p><p>Then she bolted up to a sitting position again.</p><p>What she\u2019d heard hadn\u2019t been the television.</p><p>She heard it clearly now, the sound of sobbing.</p><p>Heart-wrenching tears.</p><p>Tears...</p><p>Just as she had heard them earlier...when she had seen that vision of Genevieve O\u2019Brien.</p><p>16</p><p>I t had been a hell of a long day. Joe knew damned well that there were things Leslie hadn\u2019t told him about her friends Adam and Nikki, just as he was sure there were plenty of things she thought and felt that she didn\u2019t say to him. But she trusted him. And that was enough for the moment. Though he ached to hold her\u2014and more\u2014he kept his distance. He had to.</p><p>As soon as he got home, he looked up Harrison Investigations on the Web. The official site was bare bones, giving little but contact information, but he did find several articles. He read them all, wondering whether to be amazed, amused or irritated at the allusions to the supernatural, including several strange situations that had required the government\u2019s intervention; situations that had been managed through Harrison Investigations. An apologetic call to a sheriff he\u2019d worked with once in a town west of Richmond supplied him with far more of a response than he\u2019d expected. His friend was friends with a fellow lawman, a Sheriff Stone, who was married to one of Harrison\u2019s associates and swore by the man.</p><p>At the least, Leslie was safe for the night, Joe thought. He could get some real sleep.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t.</p><p>He prowled back to his own basement, making a mental note to himself to make sure to do something with the music he\u2019d found.</p><p>He went back upstairs and pulled out his copy of the picture of Betty, Genevieve and Brad, and studied it some more. When he\u2019d first seen it, he\u2019d been ready to drag Brad out of whatever watering hole he might have been frequenting and tear him to pieces. But Leslie had been right. He had nothing to go on here. Or not enough, anyway. No proof. He had to get a few more answers before going postal on the guy. No, before notifying the cops so they could arrest him.</p><p>He was still restless. He tried a long hot shower and lying down to watch the news, then a book. Nothing held his attention.</p><p>He was never going to sleep.</p><p>At last he rose. Hell, he\u2019d gone several nights without sleep before in his life. He could do it again. He dressed, deciding that even though it was late, Didi and Heidi were probably still out on the streets.</p><p>Watching for a black sedan.</p><p>On his way out of the house, he paused. There, on a table by the door, was a picture of Matt. He\u2019d been in the Middle East, reporting on the condition of the children there. He\u2019d ridden with the Marines and had written a series of articles that chilled, tore at the heart and demanded thought. He had never been hesitant about going into danger. \u201cHell, Joe, if we can send our soldiers over there, you bet I\u2019ll go. It will be an honor to ride with them.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been shot at, spat on and, his personal favorite, nearly run over by a mad camel. But the stories had been important to him. And as he\u2019d said at the time, he\u2019d been able to come home. Not all their countrymen would. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Joe picked up the picture of Matt with a host of children and stared hard at it, as if staring at the man himself.</p><p>\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have been an asshole?\u201d he said aloud. A moment later, he put the picture down and headed out the door. As he did, it occurred to him that he had to forget the black sedan and tell Didi and Heidi to get off the streets for a while. Didi\u2019s job interview was coming up; he hoped that would change life for her.</p><p>But then there was Heidi. He wondered if Genevieve O\u2019Brien would have been able to change the woman\u2019s life if she hadn\u2019t disappeared.</p> <p>Leslie was convinced that she was alive.</p><p>But how long could she remain so?</p><p>Sitting up in bed, Leslie remained still and listened. The sound had disappeared.</p><p>She waited, certain it had come from the basement, hoping it would come again. She glanced over at Nikki, who was still sleeping. Leslie hesitated, thinking that she had promised Joe to keep the door to her room locked.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t alone in the house. Nikki was here, and so was Adam, who was sleeping just down the hall.</p> <p>She crawled out of bed carefully, found her robe and slippers, and tiptoed to the door. For a moment she thought about waking Nikki, but she had the strange sense that the house wouldn\u2019t \u201cspeak\u201d to her unless she was alone.</p><p>She must resemble a ghost herself, she thought, wafting down the staircase and heading to the foyer. She looked out to the street, almost expecting to see someone leaning on a lamppost, or to discover that Joe\u2019s car was parked across the street, despite the fact that she had friends in the house with her.</p><p>But the street was quiet.</p><p>In the shadows cast by the dim night-lights, she held very still for several seconds. Then she thought she heard it again and frowned. This time the sound was somehow different.</p><p>Muffled, faint, like an echo.</p><p>She went down the hallway to the kitchen, then into the servants\u2019 pantry, and hesitated again before lifting the hatch. As always at night, the basement entry loomed like an abyss.</p> <p>She went for one of the lanterns and then carefully walked down the stairs.</p><p>The crates remained from their work that day, but Brad had carefully tended to their tools. The cold and empty hearth seemed all the more depressing because of the broken bricks along one side.</p><p>She stood still, waiting, until once again she heard the sound.</p><p>She moved to the wall to the right of the hearth, facing northeast, toward the dig and the old subway lines.</p><p>As she stood there, literally putting her ear against the brick, she became aware of something in the room. A presence. She turned.</p><p>Elizabeth was standing there, though not, as Leslie might have expected, hovering over the crate that contained her bones. She stood, watching Leslie, a sad smile on her face.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Leslie said very softly.</p><p>The woman\u2019s smile deepened. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p> <p>Leslie shook her head. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have done it without your help.\u201d She hesitated for a moment. \u201cWithout Matt\u2019s help.\u201d</p><p>The apparition stood still for a minute, then said, \u201cHe loves you very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...Matt?\u201d Leslie said, her heart skipping a beat.</p><p>But Elizabeth didn\u2019t reply. The strange sound of distant sobbing came again. Still muffled, like an echo of the past.</p><p>\u201cShe needs you, too,\u201d Elizabeth said.</p><p>\u201cWho needs me? Can you help me?\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth lifted a hand. She seemed uncertain. Then she pointed toward the wall. Leslie felt as if a shaft of ice had pierced straight through her.</p><p>\u201cIs she buried there?\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth looked uncertain. \u201cShe cries,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIf I can just find her, get to her...can you help me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can try...it\u2019s not my time...I don\u2019t know...I can try.\u201d Elizabeth started to move, then stopped. She frowned suddenly, with a look of alarm.</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d she cried, and she suddenly faded away.</p><p>Then Leslie heard what the ghost had heard.</p><p>Something that was not an echo of the past in any way. Something real.</p><p>Footsteps. Furtive, stealthy, and somewhere on the floor above.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>Joe saw Didi leaning on a shop window, smoking.</p><p>Her face lit into a smile, and she walked over to the car.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you ever sleep?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cListen...I know I asked you to keep an eye out for that car, but I was wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen a black sedan all night,\u201d Didi told him with a yawn.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Heidi?\u201d he asked, suddenly anxious.</p><p>\u201cAround the corner. She was restless, so she went for a walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind her. Find her, and go home for the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Joe, you\u2019re a good guy, but you can\u2019t fix the whole world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidi, it\u2019s occurred to me that this guy may know that we\u2019re on to the black sedan.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he could start using another car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh.\u201d A shadow crossed her face as she realized the advantage that would give him.</p><p>\u201cFind Heidi, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, Joe,\u201d she said.</p><p>He pulled out a copy of the photograph. \u201cOne more favor. Do you recognize this guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Brad,\u201d Didi said flatly.</p><p>\u201cYou know him?\u201d He sounded surprised. \u201cJust how well do you know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat depends what you mean by \u2018well.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn every way, Didi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I know him in every way. Do I know him well? No. But he treats us decent. He doesn\u2019t act like an asshole. Sometimes he brings us movie tickets. He doesn\u2019t come a lot, though, just now and then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long has he been coming by?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor years,\u201d Didi assured him.</p><p>Joe felt the tension growing him. \u201cDidi, right now\u2014just for right now\u2014if he comes by, don\u2019t get in a car with him, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never gotten in a car with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy place isn\u2019t as bad as Heidi\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever. For right now, don\u2019t be alone with him. Got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Joe. Whatever you say.\u201d She shook her head, a rueful smile on her face. \u201cKnow what? You\u2019re the first man in ages who\u2019s ever cost me money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidi...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll be careful. I want to make that job interview, you know. I\u2019ll find Heidi, and I\u2019ll go to bed for the night. Alone. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood kid,\u201d he told her, and he watched her disappear out of sight around the corner before he drove away. He didn\u2019t intend to go far. He meant to park, and walk the area himself.</p><p>Matt knew Leslie had gone down to the basement because he\u2019d followed her there. He\u2019d tried so hard to touch her\u2014hell, he wanted to shake her. She was supposed to be locked safely in her room.</p><p>And then...</p><p>He heard footsteps.</p><p>He hurried upstairs. The servants\u2019 pantry was empty; the footsteps were coming from elsewhere in the house. Matt moved along the hallway.</p><p>The intruder had just gained entry and was standing in the front hall. About six feet tall, and wearing a dark jacket and ski mask. He clearly meant not to be seen and, if seen, not to be recognized.</p><p>He was in the house. And there had been no alarm, no cracking of glass, no snapping of wood. He had gained entry despite the alarm.</p><p>And now he had paused, listening to the silence and the settling of the old house.</p><p>The intruder started down the hall, heading toward the servants\u2019 pantry...and the basement below\u2014where Leslie would be trapped.</p><p>Matt rushed fiercely down the hallway, ready to tackle his adversary, as he had once tackled opposing players back in his football days. He was sure he would drive right through the intruder, making no impact, but...</p><p>The other man stopped. Staggered. Then he raised his arm to reveal that he was carrying a gleaming bowie knife, sharp and deadly.</p><p>Amazingly, he had felt Matt\u2019s attack.</p><p>Matt backed away, gathered all his force and raced forward again.</p><p>Again he made impact, and again the man swung the knife through empty air.</p><p>The sound of a siren suddenly penetrated from the street. The intruder seemed to feel a sense of deep panic. He turned, stumbling back toward the door, where he paused, as if regaining his senses. Matt got ready to gather all the strength he had left and attack again.</p><p>The intruder punched numbers into the alarm in seconds flat, solving one mystery and deepening another. Then he was out the door. Matt tried to follow. He had to go after the offender, rip off his mask, had to find out who had killed him. Who meant to kill Leslie.</p><p>He hit the door. Tried to get through it. Couldn\u2019t. He let out a groan of fury and despair.</p><p>Leslie knew she couldn\u2019t let the intruder corner her in the basement. She hurried up the stairs to the servants\u2019 pantry and stood there, listening. The house had grown silent. She waited, then silently shut the hatch, but still she hesitated, unsure whether to stay where she was or brave the return journey to the bedroom.</p><p>He might be out there. Standing dead still. Hovering in silence, as she was doing. Waiting, knowing he had been heard, biding his time...</p><p>Suddenly she heard the soft thudding of feminine footsteps on the stairs, followed by the sound of Nikki\u2019s voice. \u201cLeslie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch out!\u201d Leslie cried. \u201cNikki, be careful!\u201d</p><p>She rushed through the kitchen and along the hall toward the entryway, determined to keep any harm from coming to Nikki. But when she reached her friend, in sight of the front door, it was closed, the alarm blinking, and there was no sign of anyone having entered.</p><p>Stunned, she came to a complete standstill, staring wildly around.</p><p>\u201cLeslie?\u201d Nikki asked, flicking on the light.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on down here?\u201d Adam called out firmly. He was already halfway down the stairs, and he was armed. It was just a small pistol, but Leslie had never seen him with a weapon before. She was sure, however, that he knew how to use it, and that he wasn\u2019t afraid to do so. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI could have sworn there was someone in the house,\u201d Leslie said.</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019d better take a look around,\u201d he said.</p><p>Nikki was still frowning. \u201cWhat were you doing up?\u201d she asked Leslie.</p> <p>\u201cI...I was looking for a ghost,\u201d she admitted. \u201cOr something. I keep hearing the sound of sobbing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake that a really good look around,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>Before they could take action, they heard the sound of a car pulling to a sudden halt outside.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Joe,\u201d Leslie said in surprise, staring out the window. She saw him exit his car, looking at the house anxiously, and realized that he could see her staring out at him.</p><p>She walked over to the door, keyed in the alarm and threw it open. She was shivering, but she was also grateful to see him. She tried not to betray her sense of panic in her voice. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you to go home to bed?\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing up?\u201d he demanded worriedly, ignoring her question.</p><p>She waved a hand vaguely. \u201cUm...noises.\u201d</p><p>He entered, looking from her to Nikki, and then to Adam, who somehow managed to look dignified despite being clad in a terry robe and scuffed slippers\u2014perhaps because he was carrying a gun, Leslie thought half hysterically\u2014and then back to Leslie. Before Joe could say anything, Adam told him, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m licensed, and I know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><p>Joe looked back at him. \u201cI didn\u2019t doubt it for a minute. But...you thought that you had an intruder?\u201d He was clearly worried by the possibility.</p><p>\u201cI must have been mistaken,\u201d Leslie said.</p><p>\u201cI say it won\u2019t hurt to make a thorough search of the place,\u201d Adam said. He was amazingly cheerful for someone whose sleep had been so rudely interrupted.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take the downstairs,\u201d Joe said, taking Leslie\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cUpstairs for us, then,\u201d Adam said, nodding at Nikki. \u201cYou\u2019re armed?\u201d he asked Joe.</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d Joe said quietly. Leslie gave him a shocked look, and he shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m always looking for the bad guys, remember?\u201d he told her.</p><p>Adam and Nikki started back up the stairs, leaving Joe and Leslie alone in the front hall.</p><p>\u201cOkay, what\u2019s going on?\u201d Joe asked, staring intently into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cNothing. I\u2019m sure I imagined it all,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean...it\u2019s an old house. It creaks. And...Joe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d He was opening doors as he led her down the hall, turning lights on as he went, chasing the shadows out of the corners.</p><p>\u201cJoe, I think there\u2019s a shaft or a tunnel near here somewhere.\u201d</p> <p>He paused, looking at her. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think I\u2019m crazy?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, and she felt as if he were holding something back. \u201cI chased a man through this neighborhood the other night. He completely disappeared. So I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to hear that he found a bolt-hole like that somewhere around here. But what makes you think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear...noises. And I think they\u2019re coming from beyond the basement wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to look into that, then,\u201d he said seriously.</p><p>They went through the whole of the downstairs. In the servants\u2019 pantry, Joe paused, looking questioningly at Leslie, who ducked her head, unwilling to meet his eyes. Then he lifted the hatch. Light streamed up from below; she had forgotten to turn off her lantern earlier.</p><p>Joe didn\u2019t say anything, only started down the stairs. He waved a hand at her to stay where she was until he had made a circuit of the room.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he said.</p><p>She went down and found him studying the hearth and the wall beside it. He walked closer to the bricks and tapped them, pushed at them.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked at last.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He looked at her. \u201cI thought maybe there might be a hidden latch, a secret door, a room behind the room. Sort of like your city beneath the city.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She walked over and stared at the wall with him. The grout was almost as dark as the brick. She tapped at one brick after another, but she couldn\u2019t tell if there was a hollow space behind it or not.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d asked me for maps,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. I got them myself. At the library,\u201d she explained.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the first subway ran north from City Hall to 145th Street,\u201d she said.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cSomething to think about. Anyway...the house is empty. I guess I should go.\u201d</p><p>Not really, she could have told him. But as for any flesh-and-blood danger...</p><p>\u201cAdam is in the room you were in last night, and Nikki is with me. But please, don\u2019t sleep in your car again\u2014and don\u2019t try to tell me that\u2019s not exactly what you\u2019re planning to do. The bed in the master chamber upstairs actually has a brand-new mattress on it. Stay here,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAll right. It\u2019s going to be a busy morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. You have your meeting with Eileen.\u201d She paused. \u201cAnd you\u2019re going to speak to Brad, too, right?\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath. Exhaled. \u201cLeslie, he\u2019s been a customer of the girls on the street for a long time now. Years.\u201d</p><p>She felt the blood drain from her face, but she refused to believe it. Brad? A kidnapper, even a murderer? No. No way.</p><p>\u201cLots of men hire prostitutes,\u201d she said.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cHey, I\u2019m not with the vice squad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoe, if you get into a fight with him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no intention of fighting with him. I\u2019m just going to tell him what I\u2019ve discovered and see how he reacts. But if I ever find out he was behind what happened to Matt, or what\u2019s been happening to you...\u201d He didn\u2019t need to go on; the threat was obvious.</p><p>\u201cI promise you, Brad would never hurt me. For one thing, I\u2019m the one who makes him famous all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s call it a night, shall we?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and started up the steps ahead of him. They met Nikki and Adam back in the main entry hall. \u201cClear?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cClear,\u201d Adam agreed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I guess I heard the house creaking,\u201d Leslie said.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing like a good tour of a historic house in the middle of the night, I say,\u201d Nikki said with a casual smile.</p><p>\u201cAll right, then...back to bed?\u201d Adam suggested.</p><p>They all started back up the stairs. Leslie was surprised when Joe, who was bringing up the rear, paused on the top step, looking down.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Leslie asked.</p><p>\u201cThe house,\u201d he murmured. \u201cJust the house.\u201d</p><p>On the upper landing, they split up.</p><p>\u201cI promised Melissa that I\u2019d buy the doughnuts tomorrow morning,\u201d Leslie murmured. \u201cThis morning, now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll still make it up early,\u201d Nikki promised.</p><p>\u201cYour bed is in there\u2014just step over the cords that hold the tourists back,\u201d Leslie told Joe, pointing.</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d he said. \u201cI get to cross the line.\u201d He gave her a kiss on the forehead and said good night to Adam and Nikki. Adam gave Leslie a thumbs-up and headed for his room.</p><p>Nikki looked at Leslie and said, \u201cThis time, let\u2019s lock the bedroom door, too, huh?\u201d</p><p>Leslie nodded. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I scared everyone, but I know I heard something. I swear there\u2019s someone sobbing down there,\u201d she said as they headed toward their room. \u201cAnd it\u2019s so strange. Sometimes it sounds as if it\u2019s real, happening right now, but other times, it\u2019s like an echo of something that happened a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo is it real or ghostly?\u201d Nikki asked, closing the bedroom door behind them and locking it herself.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just it. I don\u2019t know.\u201d Leslie crawled into bed, then rolled over to face Nikki. \u201cI could swear that there\u2019s a shaft...a room, a tunnel, something, near here. I have the subway maps, but...Anyway, we\u2019ll start searching tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Nikki hiked herself up on an elbow. \u201cAt least Joe believes in you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never actually told him I see ghosts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he knows you have a special sense. And he believes in it. And if you don\u2019t plan on keeping him in this house with you, then neither Adam or I will leave.\u201d</p><p>Leslie laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m starting to frighten myself. Joe is more than welcome to stay in this house.\u201d</p><p>Nikki grinned and plumped her pillow. \u201cGood. Now, let\u2019s get some sleep. Doughnut time is near.\u201d</p><p>She rolled over, and Leslie sensed that she fell asleep almost instantly.</p><p>But she herself lay awake. She could sense that someone was in the room, and she was certain that...</p><p>That it was Matt.</p><p>She felt his warmth. She fell asleep at last, content in the sensation of being held in his arms.</p><p>The morning went surprisingly smoothly. By the time Leslie and Nikki headed downstairs, Adam and Joe had gone out to buy doughnuts and left coffee brewing. Melissa arrived and was delighted with the company. Then Tandy and Jeff came in, and Adam and Nikki admired their costumes before Nikki exchanged stories with them, New Orleans myth and legend vs New York.</p><p>But, inevitably, it came time to head to the dig. They circled the fence, said hello to the guards and were ushered through the gate. They were greeted by a number of the grad students, who seemed to know Joe as well as they knew her, Leslie thought.</p><p>She was dismayed to find, when they reached the crypt, that Professor Laymon and Brad were already there. She could feel the tension grip her when Joe greeted Brad, but apparently, whatever suspicion Joe was feeling, he hid it well. Brad clearly sensed nothing, and, true to his word, Joe kept from making a scene.</p><p>\u201cBrad, I\u2019d really like some time to talk later,\u201d Joe told him.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDrinks after work? I\u2019m buying,\u201d Joe told him.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re buying, it\u2019s a deal,\u201d Brad said.</p><p>\u201cGreat. O\u2019Malley\u2019s?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA fine place,\u201d Brad said, feigning a decent Irish accent.</p><p>\u201cYou staying here?\u201d Joe asked Adam a little while later.</p><p>\u201cThrough the morning, at least,\u201d Adam said. \u201cLonger, if you think it\u2019s necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go meet Eileen Brideswell, but I\u2019ll be back later.\u201d Joe said, offering Laymon a hand. Then he kissed Nikki on the cheek. \u201cI expect you\u2019ll be at the airport by the time I get back, but it\u2019s been a real pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLikewise,\u201d Nikki assured him.</p> <p>As Joe left, Leslie thought that Laymon couldn\u2019t be happy that she had brought Adam and Nikki, two \u201ccivilians,\u201d along, but he hadn\u2019t said anything. In fact, he had decided that so long as he was going to be burdened with extras at his site, they should work. Now Nikki was recording a list of their findings, while Adam had been handed a soft brush and told to carefully clear the etchings on the burial stones in the walls. She and Brad had already begun to carefully work on the stone tombs that littered the crypt.</p><p>Eventually, Laymon got a summons to come up to discuss something with a city official. Brad went along with him, anxious, as always, to make sure he was there if anything newsworthy came up.</p><p>While they were gone, Leslie showed Nikki and Adam the register with the births and deaths. \u201cSee? Mary...Mary...a few Kathleens...and more Marys,\u201d she said.</p><p>They were all facing the wall, but Nikki straightened suddenly. And turned.</p><p>Leslie did the same, while Adam just watched the two women and kept very still.</p><p>Mary was back.</p> <p>She gazed at them solemnly.</p><p>\u201cMary?\u201d Nikki said gently, walking toward her.</p><p>The spectral child edged away. To Leslie\u2019s surprise, she felt a tiny hand slip into hers. Like any shy child, Mary was hugging close to her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Leslie told her gently, squeezing the hand that so trustingly enfolded in her own. \u201cNikki is my friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m so glad to meet you,\u201d Nikki said. \u201cWe think Leslie found your mother, and we can make sure you\u2019re together, but...Mary, what was your last name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean...I\u2019m Nikki Blackhawk, and Leslie is Leslie MacIntyre. What\u2019s your last name?\u201d</p><p>The little girl whispered something.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Nikki asked.</p><p>Leslie dropped to her knees, praying not to be interrupted at this crucial moment. \u201cSherman. Mary Sherman,\u201d the little girl said at last.</p><p>Leslie stood, rumpling ghostly hair. \u201cMiss Mary Sherman, please don\u2019t worry. I promise that I\u2019m going to take good care of you and your mother. All I have to do now is find exactly where you are, and it\u2019s near here, right? Very near here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d Mary said.</p><p>Leslie smiled at Nikki, then at Adam, who was still just watching her and Nikki silently. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for a child\u2019s grave belonging to Mary Sherman. Let\u2019s get to work.\u201d</p><p>They began inspecting the crypt, Nikki using the register, Leslie and Adam covering the tombs on the floor and reading the plaques on the wall.</p><p>\u201cBingo,\u201d Adam said softly a little while later.</p><p>Leslie hurried over to him. He had dusted off a plaque on the wall. She read the old English carefully. There were six tiny coffins behind the slab; the children interred within had all died of a fever.</p><p>The last name was that of Mary Sherman. Leslie looked around, but the little girl was gone.</p><p>After the coffins had been discovered, Leslie kept staring at the walls, tapping them.</p><p>\u201cLeslie?\u201d Nikki said worriedly.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s another way in here,\u201d Leslie said. \u201cI realized\u2014as we found the coffins\u2014that I was here when I was supposedly knocked out by the falling ceiling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>They began a search together. Nothing. No secret door. At least, none that the ages would still allow them to find.</p><p>Nikki set an arm around Leslie\u2019s shoulders. \u201cWe did find Mary,\u201d she said.</p><p>Leslie sighed. It was true. Now all she had to do was convince Laymon that the bones in the crypt needed to be disinterred so those of the woman they had discovered in what would have been the churchyard could be carefully buried with those of her child.</p><p>\u201cMary?\u201d she called softly. \u201cMary, I need your help. Is there another way in here? Please, Mary, I need to know.\u201d</p><p>One moment the child was nowhere to be seen and the next she appeared. But just as she did, there were loud noises from above. Laymon was returning.</p><p>Mary faded away, but just before she disappeared, it looked to Leslie as if a look of pure panic crossed the little girl\u2019s face.</p><p>Because of Laymon\u2019s interruption? Or because of Brad, who was right behind him?</p><p>17</p><p>\u201cS he\u2019s your child, isn\u2019t she, Eileen?\u201d</p><p>Eileen Brideswell stared back at Joe for a long minute, her features giving away nothing. Then she lowered her head. He saw the tear she wasn\u2019t able to catch land on the hard wood of the table.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to upset you.\u201d</p><p>Eileen looked up, quickly wiping her eyes. \u201cYes. You don\u2019t understand. When I got pregnant...We were society. I couldn\u2019t marry her father. He was an immigrant, a bricklayer. In fact\u2014\u201d she looked sad again \u201c\u2014he died in an accident on the job before he ever knew about Genevieve. Back then...I was afraid that the stigma of her birth would follow her throughout her life. My brother and his wife wanted a child so badly...I was pressured by my parents...I had to give her up, and by letting Donald raise her, I at least got to be her aunt. I was supposed to marry well, and my marriage did turn out to be a good one. I don\u2019t expect you to understand...and I...I don\u2019t have to explain myself to you. Your job is to find Genevieve.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d learned over the years that defensive people could become angry and hostile. Still, he\u2019d wanted\u2014needed\u2014the truth. From her own lips.</p><p>\u201cEileen, I\u2019m not judging you. Not in any way. It\u2019s just that to find her, I needed the truth. I believe you\u2019re right\u2014Genevieve wouldn\u2019t have disappeared without a word to you. I also believe she\u2019s alive.\u201d She was staring at him with wide, pain-racked eyes. He set a hand on hers. \u201cI think we\u2019re close.\u201d He pulled out a manila envelope from his briefcase, producing a number of pictures, but not the one of Betty, Genevieve and Brad. He had found newspaper photos of the men who might have been involved in the case. \u201cI need you tell me how well you know each of these men, and how well you think Genevieve might have known them.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him, startled when he showed her the first. \u201cWell, that\u2019s Robert Adair, of course. I know him very well. And through her line of work, and through the family, Genevieve knew him well, too, of course. You\u2019re not suggesting that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not suggesting anything at the moment.\u201d He produced his second photo.</p><p>She stared across the table at him. \u201cKen Dryer. Everyone in the city knows him. He\u2019s on television every time anything happens and the police need to talk to the people of New York about it.\u201d She leaned back. \u201cHe\u2019s good at his job. He calms people down. He\u2019s not a personal friend, but I\u2019ve met him. And Genevieve must have met him, too. He spoke at the opening of a day care center that was a pet project of hers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d he said, handing her the next.</p><p>Eileen stared at him, nodding. \u201cProfessor Laymon. Of course I know him. Greta is a dear friend, and I\u2019ve been involved with the Historical Society forever. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Genevieve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know. I know she was fascinated with Hastings House. As I told you, I knew too late that she\u2019d wanted to attend the gala. If only I\u2019d known...but maybe it\u2019s good that she didn\u2019t go. She might have been...although maybe that would have been better than...\u201d</p><p>He gave her a moment to pull herself together, then showed her the next picture.</p><p>\u201cHank Smith,\u201d she said. \u201cYes, I know him and so did she. She wanted his company to start building affordable housing, rather than luxury highrises. She wanted to change the world.\u201d</p><p>Last, he produced the picture of Brad. Eileen looked at him. \u201cThat\u2019s Brad Verdun. Of course she knew Brad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe met him when he was working on Hastings House.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe asked her out. She thought he was cute and fun, but far too immature. Still, I think they stayed casual friends.\u201d She sat back, shaking her head. \u201cI don\u2019t understand where you\u2019re going with this. There\u2019s a lunatic out there killing girls, my niece may or may not be alive, and you\u2019re showing me pictures of upstanding citizens.\u201d</p><p>She was indignant. He wasn\u2019t surprised. \u201cCan you think of anyone who might have read that tabloid article? Anyone who might have known that Genevieve was your biological child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow on earth would I know who read what?\u201d Eileen asked him. \u201cAnd what does it matter, what someone read in some cheap rag?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey might have been taunting her with it. They might have lured her into a car to talk about it. Eileen, what I do know is this\u2014the last time Genevieve was seen, she was getting into a black sedan. Just like the girls who disappeared before her.\u201d</p><p>The color drained from Eileen\u2019s face. \u201cThen what makes you think she might still be alive?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cNo girls have been taken in the same way since,\u201d he said. He glanced at his watch. Adam was due to leave for the airport any time now, and he didn\u2019t know how long Nikki was staying. He wanted to think that Leslie couldn\u2019t be in danger, not in broad daylight, and not at a well-populated dig, but then he remembered what had happened the other day in the crypt and realized that had already proved to be untrue. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEileen, I\u2019ll keep you posted,\u201d he promised her. \u201cAnd if you think of anything at all that might be of help, tell me.

Why?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere are black sedans parked all over the financial district on a daily basis,\u201d she said dully.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in touch,\u201d he promised.</p><p>He reached the dig right at eleven. Both Adam and Nikki were standing outside the grid tapes but near the crypt, waiting.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he asked them.</p><p>\u201cA minor argument,\u201d Nikki said, her eyes sparkling. \u201cI think Leslie is winning. Somehow she\u2019s gotten Brad on her side.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you stayed to watch the fireworks? What about your flight?\u201d he asked Adam.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve rebooked,\u201d Adam told him. \u201cAs has Nikki.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Joe wasn\u2019t sure if he was relieved or a little dismayed. Would she still want him at the house if Adam and Nikki were there?</p><p>\u201cI can put things off for a few days,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>\u201cAnd I have a very understanding husband,\u201d Nikki told him.</p><p>They both sounded cheerful, but he had the feeling that if they were staying, it was because they were worried.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d he said, mostly meaning it. He had things he could be doing, and he wasn\u2019t meeting Brad until that evening.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to stick around the site, then?\u201d he asked the other two.</p><p>\u201cOne of us will be with Leslie at all times,\u201d Nikki assured him.</p><p>He nodded again. \u201cGreat. So what\u2019s the argument about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeslie wants the remains of a woman and a child interred together. A mother and child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaymon has a problem with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaymon usually wants the bones he finds studied and cataloged, but this time, he doesn\u2019t want the graves in the crypt walls disturbed.\u201d</p><p>A moment later Leslie emerged from the crypt, looking triumphant. Brad was right behind her. She didn\u2019t notice Joe\u2019s arrival at first as she turned and flashed a giant smile Brad\u2019s way, squeezing his arm. \u201cThank you,\u201d she told him.</p> <p>\u201cMy pleasure. But let\u2019s spend the day dusting and cataloguing and making the old ogre happy, huh? That was great, convincing him that you could make him out to be such a wonderful and compassionate man, not just digging into the past, but doing his best to lay it properly to rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall enjoy every long and tedious moment of the day,\u201d she promised. \u201cHey, if you run over to the trailer, I bet you\u2019ll find Hank Smith. Fill him in on what we\u2019re doing. It will be good P.R. for Tyson, Smith and Tryon, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are those TV cameras when you need them?\u201d Brad teased, running his fingers through his hair to smooth it back.</p><p>Leslie laughed, then saw Joe. She lifted her chin, clearly defying him to accuse Brad of anything as she walked over to where he was standing with Adam and Nikki.</p><p>\u201cI hear you have another success story going,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy. I think we\u2019re doing the right thing,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cGood. And Adam and Nikki are staying, so I\u2019ve been told.\u201d</p><p>Leslie frowned at that, looking at the other two. \u201cI don\u2019t like holding you guys back,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIf it weren\u2019t fine, we wouldn\u2019t be doing it,\u201d Nikki said.</p><p>\u201cWell, then, I\u2019m off to see a man about a map\u2014a bunch of maps, actually,\u201d Joe said. He didn\u2019t touch Leslie, not in that company, though he longed to. \u201cI want to check out some public records,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cI see. And you\u2019re meeting Brad for drinks this evening?\u201d Leslie asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. Can I find you all for dinner after?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got my cell phone number,\u201d she reminded him, studying his eyes. She was obviously still worried about his upcoming conversation with Brad.</p><p>\u201cAnd you can call me if you need me. Anytime.\u201d He looked from Leslie to Nikki to Adam, then back to Leslie. She was smiling again. She appreciated his concern, he knew, and he thought she really did like having him around.</p><p>With a wave, he left.</p><p>His ultimate destination was the office of public records, but he didn\u2019t head straight there. Instead, despite the traffic, he found himself driving around the area, putting together a mental map that included the prostitutes\u2019 street, the position of the dig, Hastings House and the subway. There was a lot of ongoing construction in the area. There were cranes, scaffolding and temporary wire fences on several blocks. Finally he headed past the tenement where he had talked with Heidi Arundsen and Didi, then he continued on at last to his destination.</p><p>Leslie was pleased with the day\u2019s work, especially because Laymon had accepted the ongoing help of both Nikki and Adam with little question once he\u2019d discovered that they knew how to move delicately and that Adam was a whiz at deciphering records. Besides, they were free labor, the professor had said with a smile.</p><p>They never left the site for lunch but sat in the shade and ate sandwiches from the back of a truck. When five rolled around, they were exhausted.</p><p>\u201cThat really was a good day\u2019s work,\u201d Leslie murmured, stretching her back, ready to call it quits.</p><p>Laymon sniffed. \u201cThe first in several days,\u201d he commented.</p><p>Leslie grinned at Nikki and Adam as they all cleaned up as best they could in a hurry. Brad actually seemed eager to meet with Joe.</p><p>\u201cWell...have fun,\u201d she told him, refraining from telling him that Joe suspected he might be a maniacal killer.</p><p>By the time she, Nikki and Adam walked back to Hastings House, it was closed to the public for the day, and the staff had all gone home. Adam excused himself, saying that he wanted to rest before dinner. Leslie and Nikki showered to rid themselves of the dust from their work in the crypt, and then Leslie said, \u201cWant to go for a walk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019m up for whatever you think will help.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later, they left the house.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Leslie demanded, seeing the troubled look that had suddenly come over Nikki\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Leslie insisted.</p><p>\u201cI...I might have seen Matt,\u201d the other woman said softly.</p><p>Leslie frowned, grabbing her arm. \u201cWhere? When? Why didn\u2019t I see him?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t realize what a death grip she had on her friend until Nikki gently removed her hand. \u201cI...I\u2019ve been at this longer, I guess. And I\u2019m not certain at all. It was such a pale image.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was he doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was as if...as if he was guarding the front door,\u201d Nikki said. \u201cAnd...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe reached out for you as we were leaving.\u201d</p><p>Leslie stared at her, then went running back up the steps to the house. She opened the door, almost forgetting to turn off the alarm as she burst into the entry hall.</p><p>\u201cMatt?\u201d</p><p>Nikki waited outside, behind her.</p><p>\u201cMatt, please!\u201d Leslie said urgently as she walked farther into the room. Suddenly she thought she felt it. Something gentle against her cheek, her hair. She stood there, waiting. She couldn\u2019t leave.</p><p>Nikki came back inside, closing the door behind her.</p><p>\u201cDo you see him?\u201d Leslie whispered.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Leslie couldn\u2019t see him, but she felt him. She was sure of it.</p><p>As she stood there, she suddenly heard the sobbing again. She spun around to stare at Nikki. \u201cDo you hear it?\u201d</p><p>Nikki frowned. \u201cI\u2019m...I\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>Leslie still couldn\u2019t see Matt, but she could hear him then.</p><p>Ignore whatever you think you hear, please. It\u2019s...it\u2019s dangerous for you. I\u2019ll find a way to help, I promise, but you have to get out. You have to leave. Dear, God, Leslie...</p><p>Ghosts were supposed to be accompanied by a chill, but all she felt was warmth. The warmth of his love. She shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t ignore it,\u201d she said aloud. \u201cI can\u2019t, Matt.\u201d</p><p>She turned and started walking through the house, through the kitchen, to the servants\u2019 pantry. She lifted the hatch.</p><p>\u201cLeslie, what are you doing?\u201d Nikki demanded from behind her.</p><p>\u201cListening.\u201d</p><p>The crying sound floated faintly in the air, hollow, haunting.</p><p>\u201cAre we going down?\u201d Nikki asked.</p><p>Leslie spun around to face her. \u201cDon\u2019t you hear it?\u201d</p><p>Nikki looked back at her and sighed. \u201cYes, I hear something, like a keening. But it isn\u2019t real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this time,\u201d Leslie said. Then, decisively, \u201cCome on. We\u2019re going for that walk.\u201d</p><p>She closed the hatch and started back toward the front of the house. Nikki followed her, questions in her eyes, but patient.</p><p>Leslie let Nikki leave first, then looked back into the house.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave me,\u201d she whispered. \u201cMatt...don\u2019t leave me.\u201d</p><p>She set the alarm, then closed and locked the door. \u201cI want to go around the block, if that sounds okay to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWherever you want to go,\u201d Nikki assured her.</p><p>They started walking.</p><p>There was no way out of the fact that a lot of investigative work was time-consuming and tedious. Such had been Joe\u2019s day.</p><p>But by the time he was due to meet with Brad, he had discovered several new links. For one thing, he now knew that Genevieve had almost certainly known Hank Smith well.</p><p>Furthermore, the building where Heidi Arundsen lived and Betty had once resided wasn\u2019t owned by a single man. It was managed by a drunkard with a record, a man named Sylvester Swanson. But Swanson was paid by something called the Jigger Land Corporation, which had been purchased by a megacompany two years ago.</p><p>Tyson, Smith and Tryon.</p><p>He had sifted through facts on the building and the facts on cars. Laymon drove a white Ford SUV. Brad had a refurbished classic Mustang. Hank owned a Mercedes, a Rolls and a Jaguar. Ken Dryer wheeled around in a beige Infiniti, and Robert Adair had a ten-year-old Buick. None of them owed a black sedan. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But as Eileen Brideswell had pointed out, there were hundreds of them parked in the financial district on a daily basis. He knew for a fact that both police officers, given their positions, would have access to city vehicles, plenty of which were black sedans. Hank could probably drive anything he wanted from the corporate motor pool.</p><p>Did that cut down on the possibility that Brad was the likeliest suspect?</p><p>With that information tempering the edge of his suspicions, he was able to meet Brad with a pleasant greeting. In a few minutes, they each had a Guinness and were seated in a corner booth. Joe had intentionally chosen the seat facing the door so he could see who else came and went.</p> <p>\u201cAll right, why am I here?\u201d Brad asked suddenly.</p><p>Good, Joe thought. No messing around.</p><p>\u201cYou were friends with Genevieve O\u2019Brien,\u201d Joe said flatly.</p><p>Brad didn\u2019t seem thrown by the question. \u201cYes. I knew her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou dated her?\u201d</p> <p>He laughed. \u201cShe turned me down flat. No, wait, I can\u2019t say that. She was charming, but she still said no. Said she was too busy to spend time on a casual affair with a guy who liked too many casual affairs. I tried to convince her that I was actually the perfect guy for her\u2014I wouldn\u2019t be too time consuming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly not\u2014especially since you were living in Virginia.\u201d</p><p>Brad waved a hand in the air. \u201cIt was a long time ago, a couple of years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you haven\u2019t seen her since?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure. Now and then. I\u2019d, um, run into her.\u201d</p><p>Joe set the enhanced photo with Betty, Genevieve and Brad on the table.</p> <p>\u201cThis you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure looks like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do realize that the other girl in that photo is one of the prostitutes who disappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Brad\u2019s jaw fell. He was either a hell of an actor or he was honestly surprised.</p><p>\u201cDid you ever, shall we say, enjoy her services?\u201d</p><p>Brad was studying the picture; he seemed distracted. \u201cNo...there were one or two girls, but not her.\u201d He looked up. \u201cHey, don\u2019t go judging me. I like the bar scene. I like women. Sometimes I\u2019d rather find a good whore than play games at a bar. Cut and dried. Payment up front. Look, my career means everything to me. I\u2019m not interested in getting involved at the moment. Who knows? I might have fallen in love with Leslie, but she was already in love with Matt from the time I first met her. She\u2019s still in love with him. Don\u2019t kid yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can be connected to at least one of the missing hookers. You were friends of a sort with Genevieve. Some people might say that makes you look mighty damned suspicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor hiring whores?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow often did you come up from Virginia?\u201d Joe demanded.</p><p>\u201cA few weekends, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be interesting to know what weekends.\u201d</p><p>Brad stared at Joe, his jaw set. Then he shook his head. \u201cYou want my calendar? I\u2019ll get it for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to clear you? Get off your back?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cHell, yes, I want you to clear me. Maybe I should have offered you some of this information before, but, hell. You didn\u2019t exactly explain that in a city of millions\u2014more than a few of them total loonies\u2014you\u2019d decided someone around Leslie had to be a murderer. Or kidnapper. Or whatever.\u201d He looked irritated. \u201cHey, you want to know who Genevieve had a beef with? Hank Smith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was her beef with him about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I do know that one night when I was out for a stroll\u2014looking to pick up a hooker, if you must know\u2014I saw her with him in a coffee shop. I\u2019d have said hello, but they didn\u2019t see me. They were too busy fighting.\u201d</p><p>Joe was glad he\u2019d taken the seat facing the door when he saw Eileen Brideswell come in. She was with Robert Adair.</p><p>\u201cYou want some wings?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWings. Chicken wings. They call them clovers here. I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure. Get some wings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless that\u2019s all you have to say and you want me to get the hell away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWings sound good,\u201d Brad said, sipping his Guinness.</p><p>Joe motioned to their waitress and put in the order. So far, neither Robert nor Eileen had noticed the two of them.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s up with you and Leslie?\u201d Brad asked, breaking into Joe\u2019s thoughts.</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>Brad leaned back. \u201cYou\u2019re not an old friend at all, are you? You may be Matt\u2019s cousin, but you just met Leslie recently, right?\u201d</p><p>He stared at Brad. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you this. I\u2019d die for her. And I\u2019d kill for her.\u201d</p><p>Brad was dead still for a minute. \u201cSee, here\u2019s what you don\u2019t understand about me. I wouldn\u2019t die for anyone. Les actually knows that about me, and she doesn\u2019t hate me for it. The whole world can\u2019t be as noble as Matt\u2014and you. What is it with her and dead people, do you think? It works out great for me. I get all kinds of credit I don\u2019t deserve. But how does she do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a great researcher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, bull. She was always good, but since the explosion...You know, she was actually more or less pronounced dead at the scene. They had her over with the corpses, but then one of the paramedics caught something...a pulse. They lost her, then zapped her back. Think she met a bunch of dead people and brought them back with her?\u201d</p><p>Joe leaned forward. \u201cMaybe she can smell out the dead. And maybe she can smell out the living\u2014who create the dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you, you need to question Hank Smith. You don\u2019t believe me? Ask your buddy about it, Sergeant Adair. He knew about it. Genevieve complained to him about the guy. I honestly don\u2019t know what her problem with him was, other than something to do with the company. But she wanted Robert\u2019s help\u2014she wanted Hank arrested.\u201d</p><p>Brad sounded on the up-and-up. And with the information he\u2019d recently gleaned, Joe knew exactly why Genevieve would have had a beef with Hank Smith\u2014and all of Tyson, Smith and Tryon. He really didn\u2019t like Hank Smith. It would be easy\u2014and convenient\u2014to discover the man was guilty.</p><p>The wings came. \u201cYou\u2019re not seeing Leslie tonight?\u201d Brad asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I am. I\u2019ll be staying at Hastings House.\u201d</p><p>Brad smirked. \u201cIt helps to look like the man she loved, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, it\u2019s none of your business.\u201d</p><p>Brad laughed. \u201cAll right. I suppose you\u2019re not sleeping with her. You\u2019re too noble for that, right? Or are you? Maybe you\u2019re just playing the good guy, strong and reliable, and when the time is right...You\u2019re a player, the same as any man. And don\u2019t go looking at me like that. She\u2019s never going to love me, so good luck to you.\u201d He shook his head. The wings had arrived, and he dipped one in hot sauce. \u201cI\u2019m not as big an asshole as you probably think. I love Leslie. She\u2019s a friend, one of my best friends. I was pretty nuts about Genevieve, too. I cared enough about her to respect her and not hit on her when she told me it wasn\u2019t happening.\u201d He chewed for a minute. \u201cI felt sick when I heard she had disappeared. Did you know her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was beautiful. Absolutely beautiful. Huge eyes, hair like a deep auburn blanket of silk around her shoulders. And her voice...The main thing, though, what a fighter. When she thought something was right...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking about her in the past tense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really think she could still be alive?\u201d he asked.</p><p>There was genuine hope in the guy\u2019s voice, Joe realized. He wasn\u2019t using the past tense because he knew for a fact that she was dead, only because he was afraid to think otherwise.</p><p>\u201cMaybe. No one\u2019s proved she\u2019s dead, so...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s proved that any of those girls is dead, either,\u201d Brad said dully. \u201cBut I\u2019ll bet they are.\u201d</p><p>At that moment, Joe\u2019s cell phone began to ring.</p><p>He noticed that Robert Adair\u2019s phone had just started ringing, as well.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I\u2019m wrong?\u201d Leslie murmured.</p><p>\u201cWhat if you\u2019re right?\u201d Nikki asked.</p><p>They had walked around the block. And around the block again. And each time, Leslie had slowed as they had got to a certain section of the sidewalk. The way she figured it, if she really had heard crying when she\u2019d been in the basement, it had come from somewhere around here.</p><p>Because of construction, there was a wire mesh fence surrounding the corner building, with a barrier of narrow boards across a gap about ten feet wide between the building being worked on and the one next to it.</p><p>Leslie tried to figure distances. Hastings House was on the opposite side of the block. But beyond the boards and wire, this building\u2019s basement would abut the basement below the servants\u2019 pantry.</p><p>The cocktail hour was still in full swing. There were people everywhere. Down the street, Leslie knew, cops would be on duty all night, guarding the perimeters of the dig.</p><p>\u201cWe can slip behind those boards,\u201d Leslie mused.</p><p>\u201cBut we shouldn\u2019t. Why don\u2019t we call the cops?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I call the cops and they just laugh at me or, worse, tell me to mind my own business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall a cop you know, then. Call Joe.\u201d</p><p>Leslie hesitated. \u201cHe\u2019s with Brad right now. If we just slip behind the boards and check out what\u2019s down that alley...Come on. Let\u2019s just take a quick look. And then we\u2019ll call someone.\u201d</p><p>Nikki took a look around. There were people everywhere. \u201cI guess we\u2019re safe. But it\u2019s pretty dark back there.\u201d</p><p>Leslie grinned. \u201cHey, you forget what I do for a living. I always have a flashlight.\u201d She reached into her purse, producing her slim but powerful flashlight.</p><p>\u201cOkay, we take a quick look and then we call someone else.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou heard the crying,\u201d Leslie reminded her firmly.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Nikki admitted. \u201cAnd I think we should call the cops.\u201d</p><p>Leslie grinned at her and ducked behind the barricade. Nikki swore, looked around, then followed her quickly.</p> <p>A few feet along the alley, they hit what looked as if it had once been a shaft.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Leslie said excitedly to Nikki.</p><p>They could see where the opening had been covered and the cover nailed shut. \u201cI think,\u201d Leslie said thoughtfully, \u201cthat this is an old subway entrance. In use sometime around 1915. See, you can just see a hint of tile there....\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly,\u201d Nikki agreed.</p><p>Leslie started pulling at one of the boards that covered the opening. To her amazement, it came free instantly, so easily that she staggered backward. \u201cSomeone has pulled up that board before,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cLeslie, we really need to call the police,\u201d Nikki said.</p><p>\u201cWait...just let me be sure.\u201d</p><p>She trained her flashlight into the opening. \u201cThere are stairs!\u201d she said excitedly. \u201cIt is an abandoned subway entrance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat, now let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust let me get a better view,\u201d Leslie implored.</p><p>She knelt down and rested her left hand on one of the boards that was still in place, leaning down to get a better view. The board gave way, and she gasped and went careening forward.</p> <p>\u201cLeslie!\u201d Nikki yelled as she made a grab to save her.</p><p>Too late. Leslie hit the stairs and began to roll. When she reached the bottom, she bumped up against something that broke her fall.</p><p>\u201cLeslie!\u201d Nikki yelled again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right!\u201d she shouted back. \u201cI\u2019m at the bottom of the stairs.\u201d</p><p>She trained her light over the wall. This area had been boarded up, as well, in an effort to keep anyone from getting onto the unused tracks. There were weeds growing here and there, and at some point people had managed to throw empty bottles and trash down the opening.</p><p>She trained her light on the barrier. It was old. She was sure that it had been put up decades ago. Shops, houses, the street itself, must have changed time and time again since the entrance had originally been abandoned and covered. Beyond the boards, she knew, there would be darkness. An old tunnel, dangerous, unused. She closed her eyes for a minute, trying to remember the old subway maps she had copied at the library. The tunnel was right where it should have been\u2014and very close to the basement under the servants\u2019 pantry at Hastings House.</p><p>She started to rise, then remembered that her fall had been broken by something at the bottom of the steps.</p><p>Curious, she trained her light downward.</p> <p>It appeared to be a bundle of old clothing.</p><p>Suddenly she realized that there was an unpleasant scent in the air.</p><p>The scent of decay...</p><p>She reached down, her light still trained on the bundle of clothing.</p><p>It was then that she realized she was looking at the body of a dead woman.</p><p>18</p><p>J oe\u2019s heart was in his throat when he arrived on the scene.</p><p>The street was crowded with police cars, the coroner\u2019s wagon and a dozen detectives. He arrived with Robert Adair, who immediately took charge. At first, Joe couldn\u2019t even find Leslie, there was so much commotion.</p><p>Then he saw her.</p><p>She was standing by one of the police cars, with Nikki beside her. She didn\u2019t appear to be hurt or even fazed. In fact, she looked incredibly calm.</p><p>He went over to her immediately, taking her by the arms, searching her eyes. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said, and he cast a reproachful glance toward Nikki. \u201cExplain to me how you happened to be down at the bottom of an abandoned subway entrance.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, opened her mouth to speak, then paused as if to rephrase her answer. \u201cI just...found it. The boards were loose, so I took a peek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell,\u201d Joe muttered. \u201cExcuse me. I need to see if they\u2019ll let me see the body.\u201d</p><p>Luckily, one of the cops guarding the entrance to the alley happened to be the guy Joe had talked to a few nights earlier. He sent Joe through to Robert Adair, who was down at the foot of the stairs. One of the detectives tried to stop him, but Robert shouted up that it was all right for Joe to come down.</p><p>The body was badly decayed, and insects and other scavengers had obviously been dining on it for a while.</p><p>The M.E. stood, dusting his gloved hands. \u201cShe\u2019s been down here a long time, probably four to eight weeks. Some of the flesh has been eaten entirely away. They\u2019ve got a serious rat problem here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s definitely a woman?\u201d</p><p>The M.E. nodded. \u201cI\u2019d say between the ages of twenty-five and thirty-five. She was about five and a half feet tall, maybe a hundred and twenty pounds.\u201d</p><p>One of the detectives nervously joked, \u201cHell of a way to lose weight, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right,\u201d Robert said. \u201cCause of death? Can you tell me that yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrangulation. Her own scarf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it one of the prostitutes?\u201d another officer asked.</p><p>The M.E. shrugged. \u201cGuys, as you can see, I don\u2019t have a lot to work with here. I\u2019ll get you facts as fast as I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Robert said, then swore. \u201cHell, we knew they had to be somewhere. Dead two months or so...has to be our last girl.\u201d</p><p>Or Genevieve O\u2019Brien? Joe thought.</p><p>\u201cUnless it\u2019s Genevieve O\u2019Brien,\u201d someone said, voicing his own fears.</p><p>Except that, despite the state of the body, Joe knew it wasn\u2019t. There wasn\u2019t so much as a hint of red in the hair. It was Betty. He didn\u2019t need the M.E.\u2019s report to settle that in his mind.</p><p>He prayed that whatever sixth sense Leslie had accessed during her \u201cvision\u201d was right and Genevieve was alive somewhere.</p><p>When he headed back toward the police car where Leslie was waiting, Joe discovered that she was giving a detailed report to one of the officers\u2014and she was lying through her teeth. She had stepped behind the barricade to pull up her panty hose, stepped on the boards over the opening without realizing it, and they\u2019d given way under her weight and she\u2019d fallen down the steps. Then Nikki had dialed 911 and made certain Robert Adair was alerted.</p><p>Robert had followed Joe up to the surface and joined them over by the car. \u201cDetective Langdon, are you done with these ladies?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake them home, Joe. As soon as I have anything on the body, I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d</p><p>Joe nodded. \u201cThanks. You know, this may not even be one of our girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay not be,\u201d Robert said with a shrug. \u201cBut their street is only a block away. Anyway, I\u2019ll call you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, you two,\u201d Joe said to Leslie and Nikki. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoe, don\u2019t be angry,\u201d Leslie implored.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019ve just found a murder victim, maybe helped solved a puzzle the police haven\u2019t gotten a grip on in almost two years. Was it at great personal risk? Yes. But am I angry? No. But, Leslie, why the hell didn\u2019t you call someone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was going to. I fell down the steps,\u201d she said. \u201cHonest.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, setting an arm around her shoulders and staring at Nikki.</p><p>\u201cWe were going to call for help just as soon as we got a look,\u201d she said.</p><p>Joe groaned. \u201cI\u2019m getting you back to Hastings House, and we\u2019ll send out for pizza,\u201d he said, starting down the sidewalk.</p><p>Leslie looked at him, puzzled. \u201cUh, sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to keep you off the streets and away from holes in the ground for a while. I\u2019ve got to go back out, but you\u2019re staying in. I\u2019m going to hire an off-duty cop to watch Hastings House tonight.\u201d</p><p>He was walking too quickly, he realized. Leslie and Nikki were both having to hurry to keep up. \u201cJoe, why do we need a guard at the house? Adam will be there, Nikki will be there, and later on you\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll get there. And I want the code on the alarm changed\u2014\u201d why hadn\u2019t he taken care of that before? he berated himself \u201c\u2014and another bolt added to the door. Also, I want a steel bar for the hatch cover in the dead room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dead room?\u201d Nikki asked.</p><p>\u201cThe servants\u2019 pantry,\u201d Leslie explained.</p><p>When they reached the house, they didn\u2019t have to explain to Adam what had happened. They found him in the kitchen, watching the news. He ignored Joe and looked directly at Leslie. \u201cYou knew she was down there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Adam persisted.</p><p>\u201cBut earlier, I heard crying,\u201d Leslie said.</p><p>\u201cYou heard a dead woman crying?\u201d Joe asked in disbelief.</p><p>She stared at him, standing tall and straight, hands on her hips. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNikki and Leslie can both...see things from beyond the grave,\u201d Adam said delicately.</p><p>\u201cYou see ghosts?\u201d Joe accused Leslie.</p><p>\u201cSometimes.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cMatt? Do you see Matt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, but her voice quavered.</p><p>\u201cAdam, let\u2019s you and I go get some takeout,\u201d Nikki suggested.</p><p>\u201cCome right back, please,\u201d Joe said, the words clearly an order, but his eyes stayed hard on Leslie\u2019s.</p><p>She was silent as they left.</p><p>\u201cYou actually see ghosts,\u201d he said at last</p><p>\u201cSometimes,\u201d she repeated. \u201cIn this case...I heard crying. But, Joe\u2014\u201d</p><p>He waved a hand to cut her off.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI do believe you. That\u2019s the problem,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeslie, you\u2019ve got to get out of here. I mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Joe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeslie, I think you were the target on the night of the gala, not Matt. I just don\u2019t know why. And now someone out there is kidnapping and killing women. And I think it\u2019s someone who knows you. Who knows you have a gift for finding the dead. For whatever reason\u2014maybe for lots of reasons\u2014someone sees you as a threat, don\u2019t you see that? And you\u2019re in danger here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was quiet. \u201cHow\u2019s Brad?\u201d</p><p>Joe frowned, startled by the question. \u201cHe\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you didn\u2019t...?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI told you I wasn\u2019t going to hurt him and I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you still think...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s a jackass, but one with a certain amount of integrity. Is he guilty? I still don\u2019t know. What I do know is that the area around here is honeycombed with underground passages. And there are a few things I have to do tonight, but I\u2019m going to see to it that you\u2019re safe. I\u2019m going to rejoin the police, and we\u2019re going to find the truth. Without you. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoe,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cMaybe things happen for a reason. Maybe I\u2019m back here to help, to stop this bastard. For all I know, maybe I wasn\u2019t supposed to survive the explosion, but now I have a chance to try to help. You have to let me. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have helped, Leslie. But now you have to let the pros take over.\u201d</p> <p>He took her into his arms then and cradled her against him. Every male cell in his body wanted more. Every caution in his mind warned him that he could offer no more than his support right now, his friendship, his strength...his life.</p><p>He drew away, even though she wasn\u2019t fighting his hold. She was staring up into his eyes.</p><p>She touched his cheek, a smile slowly curving her lips. \u201cI\u2019ll behave. Where are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to get back to Robert. The rest of that tunnel needs to be checked out.\u201d</p><p>She frowned and backed away from him, her words suddenly urgent. \u201cThat\u2019s the most important thing you can do. She\u2019s down there somewhere, Joe. Genevieve is down there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you be so certain?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause of the crying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard the echo of the dead girl\u2019s tears, but I hear Genevieve crying, too, and her tears are real. And she\u2019s not far from this house. I know it.\u201d</p><p>He pulled out his cell phone. Then he hesitated. It was ridiculous to suspect Robert. But Robert had been on his list, and Robert was the one handling what was now no longer a missing persons case but a homicide.</p><p>Leslie didn\u2019t want to suspect Brad.</p><p>No one wanted to believe someone they knew and liked was capable of evil.</p><p>He realized he was going to have to head straight over to police HQ as soon as Adam and Nikki got back. To be professional, he had to work this as he would any other case, and that meant involving law enforcement. Luckily, it wasn\u2019t far. His feeling of urgency seemed to be increasing by the minute.</p><p>Just then he heard the door open. \u201cPizza!\u201d Nikki called out.</p> <p>Leslie smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, go.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAnd you be careful. When I get back, we have to talk.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, rose on her toes and kissed his cheek.</p><p>He left the kitchen just as Nikki and Adam entered carrying pizza boxes and a bag of sodas.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not eating?\u201d Nikki asked.</p><p>\u201cLeslie will explain,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t leave her,\u201d he ordered as he left.</p><p>\u201cNot a chance,\u201d Nikki assured him.</p><p>After he left, Leslie ate pizza, drank soda and carried on what she thought was a calm conversation, but she felt as if she were going insane.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we try it?\u201d Nikki asked.</p><p>Leslie stared at Nikki blankly. Apparently she hadn\u2019t been managing the conversation as well as she\u2019d thought. \u201cTry what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA seance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA seance?\u201d She almost choked on her pizza. \u201cA seance? Nikki, isn\u2019t that pretty silly for people like us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not,\u201d Adam told her. \u201cMaybe Matt has some learning to do and this will help.\u201d</p><p>She stared at them both. \u201cOkay. If you think it can help.\u201d</p><p>Nikki shrugged. \u201cThe goal now is to find Genevieve alive. Whether any of the ghosts here can help with that or not, I don\u2019t know. But...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s try it. If there\u2019s anything we can do, we should do it,\u201d Leslie said.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Adam asked.</p><p>\u201cWhere else?\u201d Leslie said. \u201cThe dead room.\u201d</p><p>After several frustrating minutes in which he was continually told that the man to talk to was Robert Adair, Joe was tempted to give up. It wasn\u2019t as if he didn\u2019t have other suspects.</p><p>But Robert, Ken Dryer and Hank Smith were probably the only ones in his group to have access to a contemporary black sedan at a moment\u2019s notice. Tyson, Smith and Tryon would have a fleet of cars. And as high-ranking officers, both Dryer and Adair could use any car in the police motor pool.</p><p>He put through a call to Eileen Brideswell. \u201cI need help. Now,\u201d he told her.</p><p>In a few minutes he was ushered through to the office of Lieutenant Grayson. Grayson was nearing sixty, thin and haggard. He lowered his head in thought as Joe laid out what he knew, which was, sadly, mostly hypothetical. He refrained from saying that he didn\u2019t want to take this evidence to Robert Adair because he was on the suspect list; he managed to make out that Robert was overworked and he didn\u2019t want to burden him any further.</p><p>Before Genevieve O\u2019Brien was found as a rotting corpse, as well.</p><p>\u201cI can give you three men,\u201d Grayson said. \u201cAnd permission to enter the tunnels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I need. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank Eileen Brideswell,\u201d Grayson said. It was obvious that he was feeling pressured into offering help. Why not? He already had a key officer on the case.</p><p>Grayson put through a call to a man in charge of the Metropolitan Transit Authority, and then Joe was on his way with three uniformed officers in tow. In a few minutes they were met at the functioning subway entrance nearest Hastings House by an MTA employee named Gregory Breen.</p><p>He offered Joe a map. \u201cHow good this is, I don\u2019t really know. Once you leave the main system, you\u2019re in no man\u2019s land. No one has used a lot of the old tunnels since...hell, the twenties, maybe.\u201d</p><p>Breen took them down, leading them through an employee route to a tiny station somewhere below Broadway, where they came to a locked door. He unlocked and opened it, and they came face-to-face with a wooden barricade.</p><p>\u201cTold you,\u201d Breen said. \u201cThese tunnels have been blocked off for decades.\u201d</p><p>Joe reached toward the wooden barricade, which collapsed at his touch, the wood rotted and soft.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll be a monkey\u2019s uncle!\u201d Breen exploded.</p><p>\u201cDo we really need candles?\u201d Leslie asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy not set the mood?\u201d Adam replied cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cGot any good wine?\u201d Leslie asked dryly.</p><p>\u201cSit,\u201d Nikki told her.</p><p>They\u2019d brought a table into the servants\u2019 pantry, and set three candles on it. Some light still filtered in from the main kitchen, but the small room itself was shrouded in shadow.</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d Leslie asked.</p><p>\u201cWe hold hands,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>\u201cAnd then...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave it to Nikki.\u201d</p><p>As they sat there, Leslie closed her eyes. Somehow it seemed like the right thing to do.</p><p>She waited, wondering what words Nikki would say to try to conjure the spirits. But there was no hoopla.</p><p>\u201cMatt,\u201d Nikki said softly. \u201cIf you\u2019re there, we need help. We know that you\u2019ve been trying to reach Leslie, that you have reached her, but we need more help from you. Please, if you can...\u201d</p><p>Nikki was still speaking when Leslie first felt him. Somehow she knew he was by her side.</p><p>And when she turned, she could see him.</p><p>He was there, and yet he wasn\u2019t there. He was only the merest suggestion of a form in the air, but at the same time he was the man she had known, tall, handsome and, at that moment, serious. She forgot that Nikki and Adam were present and stood, slipping into his arms. He wasn\u2019t real, but somehow she could feel him, feel his touch on her hair, his strength as he pulled her against him. And she could hear him. \u201cLeslie, you\u2019ve got to get out of here, all of you. He came in by the front door. He knows the combination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Nikki\u2019s question was Leslie\u2019s first indication that she wasn\u2019t the only one hearing Matt.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I know he\u2019s close. I fought him last time, but I couldn\u2019t stop him. Please...get out.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly the house was pitched into blackness, only the candles offering a respite from the all-encompassing darkness</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s here,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>And Leslie felt suddenly cold.</p><p>Matt had left her.</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly are we looking for?\u201d Officer Dale Nelson was young, just out of the academy. Joe didn\u2019t mind that fact. Nelson was willing and adventurous. He was just uncertain. Whether Nelson or O\u2019Hara and Myers, the two older cops, believed in their quest or not, they had been told to listen to him and give him their best. He\u2019d sent the two veteran cops down a northeastern tunnel, while he had chosen the more westerly one for himself and Nelson.</p><p>Closest to the prostitutes\u2019 street, Hastings House, the dig\u2014and the site where they had found the body earlier. If Leslie really had heard sobbing from inside Hastings House, he had to be going in the right direction. If only the remains of the system didn\u2019t add up to such a labyrinth. Progress had left behind a bone structure that was now sad and dilapidated.</p><p>And dark.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re looking for a room of some kind. A room that might be used as a cell,\u201d Joe explained. \u201cLook for anything that might be a door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotcha,\u201d Nelson said. Suddenly he let out a hoarse cry.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Joe demanded.</p><p>\u201cRat,\u201d Nelson said apologetically. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>They kept on trudging.</p><p>\u201cDouse those,\u201d Adam said, and Nikki quickly put out the candles. They stood in the pitch dark, and Leslie nearly jumped a mile when she felt a hand on her shoulder. It was Adam. \u201cI\u2019m going for the gun.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUpstairs?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdam\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be careful.\u201d</p><p>He disappeared, but Leslie could hear Nikki breathing at her side. \u201cWe can\u2019t just stay here,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a better suggestion?\u201d Nikki asked.</p> <p>She did. Down in the basement. There were tools down there. Weapons with which they could fight back.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d They heard a sudden cry from the parlor. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on in here?\u201d</p><p>Brad! Leslie didn\u2019t know whether to trust him or not. Had he cut off the electricity to take them by surprise? Or was someone else in the house, too?</p><p>She didn\u2019t know the answers to any of those questions.</p><p>She dragged the table aside and moved the braided rug.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d she whispered urgently to Nikki.</p> <p>\u201cNo...you go down there. No one knows anything about me. You hide, and I\u2019ll cover the floor with the rug. Go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNikki, I can\u2019t leave you in danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the one in danger. I\u2019ll hide, too, but if I don\u2019t put the rug back, it will be obvious where you are. Now get down there!\u201d</p><p>Leslie did. She moved down the stairs blindly, trying to remember where she had left a lantern. She groped her way around the various boxes, until her fingers curled around a lantern at last. After more exploration she also found a scraping knife. Then she hesitated, listening, trying to see the room in her mind\u2019s eyes. A stack of boxes was piled to the right of the hearth. She slipped behind them, against the wall, the knife in one hand, the lantern in the other. She waited. And waited.</p><p>There was silence. Then...</p><p>Sobbing. She turned, staring in the direction of the sound, but the room was pitch black, and she couldn\u2019t hear a thing. She remembered the way Joe had been running his hands over the wall the other day. In the dark, she began to do the same thing herself.</p><p>She touched a brick, and it gave. Stunned, she paused for a moment. Then she fumbled in the darkness, found the uneven brick again and pushed until it gave even farther. Her hand met something cold and metallic. She felt it with her fingers, trying to picture what it was. Finally she pushed it, and the air itself seemed to fill with a loud, creaking sound.</p><p>The entire wall moved. She swallowed, blinked, still in darkness, aware of what had happened only because a gust of stale air struck her. The door, however, had made a sound loud enough to wake the dead. If there were indeed a killer in Hastings House, he had heard it, which meant there was no way she could go back upstairs.</p> <p>There was only one way to go.</p><p>Forward.</p><p>Someone was in the house. Adam Harrison knew it even before he heard the voice call out from downstairs. When neither Leslie nor Nikki answered that call, he decided to play it safe and made his way along the upstairs hall as silently as possible, reached his gun quickly and started back toward the stairway. Then he heard a whisper in the darkness.</p><p>\u201cAdam?\u201d</p><p>It was Nikki.</p><p>Before he had a chance to reply, there was a commotion from below. He hurried down the stairs. He could just make out a single figure in the entry hall, but it seemed to be fighting with an unseen opponent.</p><p>\u201cStop or I\u2019ll shoot!\u201d Adam shouted.</p><p>The figure stumbled out of the house, Adam in pursuit. \u201cStop, Adam!\u201d Nikki called. \u201cWe\u2019ll call the police!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! He\u2019ll be gone before they get here,\u201d Adam shouted without stopping.</p><p>As he tore out of the house, he realized that Nikki was right behind him.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d Nelson yelled.</p><p>Joe spun around, wondering if he should have saddled himself with such a rookie.</p><p>But this time there was a look of agony on the young man\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy fucking ankle. I stepped into some kind of rut...there\u2019s a twisted rail here. Hell!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t walk. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. I\u2019ll get you out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...hell, no. You go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to leave you in an abandoned tunnel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a light. My radio is shit down here, but the light is working. Just send help as soon as you can.\u201d He winced. \u201cI\u2019m serious. I\u2019ll be all right. Find that girl.\u201d</p><p>Joe nodded. \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll get someone back to you as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a plan. Go on.\u201d</p><p>Joe nodded and left.</p><p>Leslie turned on the light; there was no reason not to. She could hear footsteps overhead. It could be Nikki or Adam, she supposed.</p><p>But maybe it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>She hurried through the doorway, checking out the door as she passed. It seemed to her that the latch and the hinges should have been far rustier. When the hell had the door been put in?</p><p>It must have been during the Civil War, when the house had been part of the Underground Railroad. She wasn\u2019t in a subway tunnel. This passage might lead to an old one, but...</p><p>She shoved at the door, closing it as best she could. Then she lifted her light. There was only one way to go.</p><p>She started walking, and then she froze.</p><p>\u201cLeslie? Are you down here? What the hell is going on? The house was pitch dark and the door was open.\u201d</p><p>It was Brad, and he sounded truly baffled. But if Brad was in the basement behind her, where the hell were Nikki and Adam?</p><p>She kept silent. Then she heard the door opening and started running along the tunnel, quickly turning out the light. She heard the creaking of the door as Brad opened it.</p><p>\u201cLeslie, it\u2019s me. Brad.\u201d He sounded indignant. \u201cDammit, Leslie, you\u2019ve got me scared to death. Where the hell are you?\u201d</p><p>She went still, barely daring to breathe. But she had to move, so she inched forward in the darkness, feeling her way along the wall. It was tile here, she thought. Then more brick followed concrete, before it turned to tile again.</p><p>\u201cLeslie, it\u2019s dark in here!\u201d Brad called.</p><p>She heard a cry in the dark, followed by a thud, like something heavy falling.</p><p>Brad?</p><p>Then nothing.</p><p>She hurried along, silent, desperate. Someone was behind her. She was sure of it. And something told her that it was no longer Brad.</p><p>Tile...concrete...damp and slick beneath her hand.</p><p>Then...wood?</p><p>There was noise coming from the shaft ahead, but Joe couldn\u2019t tell what the hell it was. He drew his gun, holding his lantern high.</p><p>It seemed close...yet simultaneously far away.</p><p>Swearing, he paused to pull out the map again.</p><p>There was a tunnel that ran parallel to the one he was in. Apparently, it had never been part of the subway. There was a notation on it. Old passageway, unusable, storage.</p><p>Storage. That meant there had to be access to it somewhere. He strained to see the tunnel ahead. Was that something in the wall, about fifty feet ahead? He hurried forward to check it out.</p><p>There were bolts; she could feel them. A door! All too aware that someone was coming up behind her and with no idea how much distance there was between them, she felt for the bolts and began to work at them. She had no choice.</p><p>There was a snick as the first bolt gave. She moved faster, heedless of the noise she was making. Without meaning to, she began to scream. \u201cHelp!\u201d</p><p>The sound came back to her as an echo as she slid the last bolt back and the door gave. Suddenly there was light. She blinked furiously against the abrupt brightness of it. She was in a room, a room that smelled of death. There was a cot in it, and a table by the cot that held a few bottles of water.</p><p>There was something piled on the far side of the room.</p><p>And there was a woman. She was dark-haired and blue-eyed, thin to the point of emaciation. Her ankles were chained together, but she was on her feet, pale and sickly but ready to do battle. Genevieve O\u2019Brien.</p><p>\u201cGet in! I can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve found me, but he\u2019s right behind you.\u201d</p><p>Leslie turned. She screamed. He was almost on them.</p><p>\u201cGet in!\u201d Genevieve implored.</p><p>Leslie hurried into the room and quickly shut the door behind her. Both women laid their full weight against the door as someone pounded against it from the other side. Genevieve looked at her. \u201cWho are you? How did you get here? Now he\u2019ll kill us both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re alive,\u201d Leslie gasped, fighting to hold the door. How long could they manage it? Who knew she was here? Adam and Nikki.</p><p>If they were still alive.</p><p>\u201cWho is he?\u201d Leslie demanded. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>Even as she asked, their enemy hit the door with staggering force and sent them flying backward.</p><p>And she knew.</p><p>Joe found the door. He thundered his weight against it time after time, trying to break through the rust of decades. Finally it gave.</p><p>He was in another tunnel. At one end, he could see a gaping doorway. Hastings House. If he had his bearings right, that was Hastings House. The crypt. And he had been right. There was a false wall, and it was open now.</p><p>He heard groaning and hurried forward, his light high. There was a body on the floor. He knelt down beside it and heard another groan.</p><p>Brad.</p><p>The man blinked. \u201cWhat the hell...? Why did you hit me like that? I swear, when I got to the house it was dark and the door was wide open. I started looking for someone...I went down to the basement and...Look, I wouldn\u2019t hurt Leslie, I swear!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow should I know? You hit me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hit you.\u201d</p><p>It was then that he heard a bloodcurdling scream.</p><p>Robert Adair came in, a sad look on his face. \u201cLeslie, I knew you were trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRobert,\u201d Genevieve said, bizarrely cheerful. \u201cYou\u2019re here. Please don\u2019t be angry. I think it will be wonderful to have Leslie with us.\u201d</p><p>Leslie shook her head, stunned, thinking as fast as she could, playing for time. Playing for her life. \u201cRobert...think about what you\u2019re doing. I think you wanted to be found. You set Joe up with Eileen Brideswell. You\u2019re a good man. You don\u2019t want to hurt me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His gun was drawn. She knew that he had killed before. She swallowed, suddenly realizing what the pile on the far side of the room was. One or more of the other girls. He had left their bodies here with Genevieve so she would know her inevitable fate. So she would behave. So he could bend her to his will.</p><p>\u201cLeslie, why couldn\u2019t you have died in that blast? Then...you could have stayed away, but you didn\u2019t. Ask Genevieve\u2014there\u2019s only one way to handle women. She had such a fit about those hookers going missing. She was going to do something. So she had to come here. She\u2019s been a delight, I have to say. But then, she wants to live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeslie wants to live, too,\u201d Genevieve said.</p> <p>\u201cRobert,\u201d Leslie said, a shocked whisper of disbelief. \u201cI just can\u2019t believe it\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho else?\u201d he asked lightly. \u201cWho else had access to sites and houses and cars, and who else could go all over the city, doing as he pleased? These tunnels are quite something, you know. You can get right into Hastings House. Of course, you figured that out, didn\u2019t you, Leslie? But did you know there\u2019s an entrance right into that crypt you discovered? I would have taken care of things the morning you were down there alone, but then Laymon had to show up before I could drag you away. No one would have known. But he showed up and I had to leave in a hurry. You\u2019re remarkably hard to kill, young lady. Not even a push onto the subway tracks could do it. You\u2019ve got to understand. I never wanted to hurt you. But you know way too much. I don\u2019t know how you know, you just do. You would have discovered me eventually. You have some kind of a touch or a sight, and it got even stronger after you survived the explosion. A shame, that. Four people dead, but I missed the one I meant to kill. I\u2019m really sorry, Leslie,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>She saw that his fingers were twitching on his gun.</p><p>He was going to shoot her. Then and there.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d a voice roared. She heard running footsteps.</p> <p>Joe!</p><p>Robert turned and fired into the tunnel, but his arms jerked and the shot went wild. It looked as if he was fighting with himself\u2014or an invisible opponent. Despite that, he kept pulling the trigger.</p><p>Again and again.</p><p>The blasts were horrendously loud in the confined space, and he was cursing and screaming even as he kept firing, the shots still going wild.</p><p>Suddenly he was slammed up against the door, his mouth an O of horror, but he wouldn\u2019t let go of the gun.</p><p>Matt! Leslie thought joyously as Robert twisted, struggling to aim his gun up the tunnel.</p> <p>Suddenly Joe loomed out of the darkness, and it looked as if Robert couldn\u2019t possibly miss him. \u201cNo!\u201d Leslie shouted.</p><p>She jumped on Robert Adair\u2019s back. Genevieve shouted, desperately trying her best to distract him. A shot rang out from the tunnel, and Robert was spun around by the force of it, staring straight at the two of them.</p><p>He smiled.</p><p>Leslie wondered why.</p><p>Then she knew.</p><p>He fired one last time, even as he died himself.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>She heard Joe scream out the single word. But she was falling. Genevieve tried to catch her as she fell, but the other woman had no strength. Leslie could only imagine what she had endured over the past weeks. They fell to the floor together as Joe raced toward them.</p> <p>But she didn\u2019t see Joe.</p><p>She saw Matt.</p><p>He was down on his knees beside her, wrapping her in his arms.</p><p>There were tears in his eyes. \u201cNo, Leslie, no...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeslie!\u201d Dimly, she heard Joe shouting. He was desperately trying to staunch the flow of blood coming from her chest.</p><p>\u201cLeslie, hang on, hang on....\u201d</p><p>She was dimly aware that the tunnels were alive with footsteps.</p><p>She smiled. She\u2019d been blessed with good friends.</p><p>\u201cLeslie,\u201d Matt whispered, cradling her. \u201cFight. Fight.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t fight. And she knew it. She reached for Matt, saw his eyes, the tears. The love.</p><p>\u201cSome things,\u201d she whispered, \u201care meant to be.\u201d</p><p>EPILOGUE</p><p>Joe sat on a concrete bench in the cemetery, staring at the newly tamped ground. He was alone; he needed to be. The funeral had been far too huge; he\u2019d felt that he needed to take a step back, so this afternoon he\u2019d come back on his own. So many good people had loved her. Adam. Nikki, who had been with Leslie when she\u2019d discovered the street-level entrance to the tunnels, the route by which Robert had escaped the night Joe had chased him. Nikki and Adam had been there when the paramedics had desperately tried to save Leslie. They had been there when she was pronounced dead. They had suffered. As had Brad Verdun, who had cried like a baby. Even Dryer had broken down when he had to go on TV to talk about what had happened.</p><p>But that was over now. Just as the torture Robert Adair had inflicted on his victims was over. Genevieve had been able to shed some light on what had made the man crack, based on his lunatic ramblings when he came to visit her in her makeshift prison. He\u2019d never had much of a social life, so he\u2019d turned to hookers, then finally turned on them. In his opinion, prostitutes deserved whatever happened to them. Genevieve hadn\u2019t been alone there when he first grabbed her and he had hurt them all, she said. When he tired of a girl, when she angered him...he killed her. Joe was there when she stoically informed the police that she\u2019d done what she had to do to live. She\u2019d also informed them that she thought he\u2019d gone psychotic because he was impotent. A powerful respected man with no one to come home to\u2014because, in his way, he was powerless.</p><p>Joe\u2019s astonishment was fading. Despite the fact that he had listed the man as a suspect himself, he had never been on top of the list, even at the end. It was still almost inconceivable. And yet, and in retrospect, someone should have figured it out before. Except that Robert Adair had been the lead detective on the case.</p><p>The pain of Leslie\u2019s death seemed dulled now, but sometimes it struck him like a knife. He went over and over the series of events in his head, trying to create a scenario in which everything worked out differently. In which she lived.</p><p>He was carrying a single rose, and now he tossed it gently onto the grave. \u201cI failed you,\u201d he said softly. She had no tombstone yet, but Matt\u2019s was there, a handsome, simple memorial in white marble. He\u2019d chosen it himself. \u201cI failed you, too,\u201d he said.</p><p>He closed his eyes. It had been an oddly beautiful day, pure blue sky, soft breeze. He had waited, though, until it was late afternoon to come back. A time when the sun was gentle, when the air was balmy, and he\u2019d sat there until the colors of sunset had washed the sky, as if the pastel shades of the coming evening could somehow make sense of everything that had happened.</p><p>Why had he come?</p><p>Did he think one of them would talk to him? Maybe, he admitted.</p><p>He felt a hand on his shoulder. He turned.</p><p>Genevieve O\u2019Brien stood there. She was almost shockingly beautiful, with her eyes the color of the sky, her hair a muted flame color that seemed to promise an inner wildness. She was slim and very pale\u2014hell, she\u2019d spent two months as a terrified prisoner in an underground cell\u2014but other than that, she looked good. Her gaze was steady. But then, she\u2019d been strong from the beginning. Strong enough to survive.</p><p>She\u2019d spoken at the funeral. It had been an outstanding tribute to the woman who had died. For her. It had stirred every heart. For a while, at least, Joe had thought skeptically, it might improve man\u2019s behavior to his fellow man. Leslie had been a true heroine.</p><p>Earlier that day, Genevieve had been standing at the grave, ready to set her flowers on the casket, when a reporter had come up to her. That had been too much for Joe. He\u2019d interposed himself between the two of them, and he wasn\u2019t exactly sure what he\u2019d said, but the reporter had run, and Genevieve had looked at him with her immense blue eyes filled with tears, and she had said simply, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Now she joined him on the bench.</p><p>\u201cHow are you holding up?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He stared at her. \u201cI\u2019m good. You...?\u201d</p><p>She stared down at the graves. \u201cI\u2019m good. Grateful. More determined than ever to make my life count.\u201d</p><p>She was amazing, he thought, then looked back at the graves. \u201cI tried so hard,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She set a hand on his shoulder. \u201cYou two saved my life. And you stopped a monster.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. He hadn\u2019t been able to save Leslie.</p><p>\u201cI could use a drink,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you please take me somewhere\u2014O\u2019Malley\u2019s, maybe. I could really use a drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...yeah. Sure.\u201d What good did it do, sitting in a graveyard?</p><p>She stood first and offered him a hand. He accepted it, rising. They started out of the graveyard, down a gentle slope.</p><p>She stopped, turning back. \u201cShe\u2019s with him now,\u201d Genevieve said softly.</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook.\u201d</p><p>He turned.</p><p>\u201cLook over there. Right where we were sitting.\u201d</p><p>He did, and blinked. It was the fading sunlight. It was the wishful thinking of his numb and tangled mind.</p><p>And yet...</p><p>There they were. Matt. Tall, broad-shouldered, hair gleaming gold, smiling at the slender beauty standing beside him. Leslie. Leslie, elegant face lifted, eyes sparkling as she looked up at the man she loved. Matt caught her hand, laughed, took a seat on the bench and pulled her against him, cradling her there in the last rays of the setting sun.</p><p>Joe blinked. He looked at Genevieve, then back at the little rise. They were gone, of course. A cloud had dulled the brilliance of those last rays.</p><p>\u201cDo you ever think that maybe, just maybe, she escaped death the first time because she was meant to do, because she was still needed here?\u201d Genevieve asked softly. She squeezed his hand. \u201cMaybe someday we\u2019ll see them again,\u201d she said pensively.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just being whimsical,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help but look back again. The cloud was gone, but so was the last of the light. Maybe they were there, together, two wonderful beautiful people, impossibly in love with each other. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>He looked at Genevieve.</p><p>\u201cDid you really see...something?\u201d he asked her. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s possible...?\u201d</p><p>Genevieve laughed softly. \u201cKnow what I believe is possible now?
