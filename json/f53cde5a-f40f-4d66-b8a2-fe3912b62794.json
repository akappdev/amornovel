Suck it up. Attack. Use your powers. Instead I leaped up on the sweater table, shaking and screaming along with the mortals in the shop. No. Get down, Gloriana St. Clair, and face the enemy.</p><p>Weapons, I needed weapons and I sure as hell wasn\u2019t using my fangs this time. I glanced around. The two women perched on the chair next to the dressing room were no help. Their shrieks could have broken glass. Three more women crouched on the counter in front of the cash register. More mortals, totally useless, though one swung an umbrella at the horde. Impressive compared to me.</p> <p>I tossed a sweater at one. Stupid. Didn\u2019t even slow it down. I was a failure. A wimp. I couldn\u2019t quit shaking and couldn\u2019t force myself to get off the table. If a god from Olympus attacked, I\u2019d be right in his face, toe-to-toe. Or another vamp. Bring him on. But whoever had planned this had found my weakness. I thought I heard one right there, on the table, and moaned, horrified.</p><p>Mice! Dozens of them. Even Achilles had his heel thing. Glory St. Clair has hers. I don\u2019t like anything that\u2019s creepy or crawly. Now my reputation and the business I\u2019d built from nothing were in shreds along with my pride. Would you shop where you saw mice? I\u2019d have joined the stampede for the door myself if there\u2019d been time.</p><p>My clerk Lacy, a were-cat, was running around like a starving woman at an all-you-can-eat buffet in kitty heaven. She whipped past me with a smile on her face, making sounds too gross to think about.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, there\u2019s another one!\u201d The brave soul on the counter with the vintage umbrella slashed at the floor, knocking a mouse toward the door. That got the logjam there cleared with a chorus of screams.</p><p>I heard a smack near my feet. \u201cLacy, what the hell are you doing?\u201d I gagged and realized I was going to have to whammy every mortal in the place.</p> <p>\u201cGlory, relax. I\u2019ve got this under control.\u201d She held up a brown bag that rustled ominously. \u201cThere must be dozens of them. I wonder who sent them. An early birthday present from Mom?\u201d She scrambled after a dark shadow that streaked across the floor. \u201cNaw. She knows a stunt like this could get me fired.\u201d She glanced at me.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d be right.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to know what had made that smudge on her cheek. Lacy was a natural beauty, red hair, porcelain skin. She dressed in the vintage clothes we sold here and looked like a model in them. Tonight the seventies bell-bottoms and tie-dyed tee were taking a beating.</p><p>\u201cWell, not Mom. These are the pet store variety. Feeders. For snakes, that sort of thing. Someone brought them in here. Planted them. There goes another one.\u201d She dove and disappeared under a dress rack.</p><p>I heard a crash and a mannequin bit the dust. The women who\u2019d been balanced on the chair had made a run for the door but were tangled up in a dress display.</p><p>\u201cMy God! My God! Get it off of me!\u201d Loud sobs then the sounds of my mannequin being used as a sledgehammer.</p><p>Obviously I had to suck it up or we\u2019d have mass hysteria on our hands.</p> <p>\u201cLadies, please, calm down.\u201d At least I wore boots as I jumped in front of them, staring into first a pair of brown eyes, then blue. I had them mesmerized in a second. \u201cYou are fine, the store is fine. There are no mice, just a little game we\u2019re playing with discount coupons.\u201d I shivered as a mouse ran by and I kicked it toward Lacy. \u201cHere\u2019s a twenty-five percent off coupon for your next visit. We\u2019re closing for some minor repairs. Mugs and Muffins next door has great coffee if you want to wait. We\u2019ll reopen in about thirty minutes.\u201d I snatched coupons from behind the counter then tugged them both to the door, dodging even more mice. These things had been planted. I had a feeling I knew who\u2019d done it.</p><p>I got those two women out then went back for the three hugging their knees near the register. Ignoring Lacy\u2019s crows of triumph as she claimed more victims, I got the last customers whammied and out of the shop, coupons in hand. Finally, I hopped on the counter myself and waited for Lacy to finish.</p><p>\u201cWhew. That was amazing. I bagged at least three dozen.\u201d Lacy grinned, her mouth still smeared with something I didn\u2019t want to think about. \u201cWhoever pulled this stunt must have cleaned out a pet supply store.\u201d She stapled the wiggling bag closed then pulled out a wet wipe from the container under the counter and cleaned off her hands and face. Lacy glanced at me. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d I sighed. \u201cHad your dinner break?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah. Sorry about that. I got a little carried away. I need to clean up the floor too.\u201d She laughed. \u201cHey, I\u2019m a predator. Think how you\u2019d act if someone came in and offered you that negative blood type you love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it.\u201d I swallowed, not sure I wasn\u2019t going to hurl. \u201cThanks. You saved the shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. But I can sniff out a mouse a mile away.\u201d She wiggled her nose. \u201cThey weren\u2019t here yesterday. I wonder who . . .\u201d</p><p>The phone rang before I could answer her. \u201cVintage Vamp\u2019s Emporium, the best store on Austin\u2019s Sixth Street.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally? Is it? I heard it just closed.\u201d The female voice was full of satisfaction. \u201cMice infestation. Disgusting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is this?\u201d I jumped off the counter, pretty sure I already knew.</p><p>\u201cIs this the owner? Gloriana St. Clair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And is this the woman who thinks she can win Jeremiah Campbell back? Mel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you like my little gift?\u201d There was a throaty chuckle. \u201cDid you scream? Of course you did.\u201d</p><p>I bit my lip, refusing to answer. Had she been in here? Seen me make a fool of myself? Damn it, if I\u2019d known . . . What could I have done differently? Dematerialized and damn the consequences.</p><p>\u201cGive him up, Gloriana. Or I\u2019ll run you out of business. Leave town and leave him to me. It\u2019s the smart play.\u201d The line went dead.</p><p>I stared at the receiver, tempted to throw the cordless across the room. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Lacy had a mop in her hand. \u201cWho was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA woman Jerry used to be with.\u201d I carefully set the phone back where it belonged. Killing it wouldn\u2019t help. It was the woman I wanted to tear into pieces. \u201cClean up and I\u2019ll reopen. I\u2019m not going to let that bitch ruin my business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll take a minute.\u201d Lacy didn\u2019t move. \u201cTell me about this woman. Mr. Blade has an old flame? What\u2019s going on? She sent in the mice?\u201d She dipped the mop into a bucket of sudsy water that reeked of pine cleaner. \u201cI might want to write her a thank-you note.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you do, send it from the unemployment line.\u201d I shook my head. There was no reason to take my bad mood out on Lacy. \u201cSorry. I know you\u2019re kidding. Jerry knew her in Miami, thought it was ancient history. But the woman doesn\u2019t see it that way. You know he\u2019s been having issues with his hotel there, making trips to deal with them. It\u2019s been her, causing trouble, trying to get his attention. Now she\u2019s brought her game here and found out I\u2019m the competition. She wants Jerry back and thinks running me out of business and out of town will do it. This was just her latest trick. I\u2019m surprised she didn\u2019t use magic.\u201d I quit breathing. I hated that pine smell. \u201cIf she were a mere mortal, this would be a nonstarter. Unfortunately, she\u2019s a voodoo priestess, Lacy, with some nasty tricks up her sleeve. Have you seen anyone in here who looks like she might be into that stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVoodoo? Don\u2019t know. How do they look? Would she be wearing a caftan and a turban, have a scary vibe? Carry around a bottle of Love Potion Number Nine?\u201d Lacy shook her head and began mopping. \u201cThat would be too easy, Glo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. All I know is that Jerry says she\u2019s beautiful\u201d\u2014I made a face\u2014\u201cwith dark skin, black hair and unusual gray green eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBet you loved that description.\u201d Lacy leaned against the mop. \u201cYou know her name? I\u2019ll watch for her credit card.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea. Melisandra Du Monde.\u201d I sighed. \u201cOf course she\u2019s beautiful. I need more info on her. I\u2019m calling Jer right now. This mouse thing is just her latest in the war on Glory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLatest? What else has she done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere have been a few accidents.\u201d I headed over to turn on the ceiling fans to air the place out and dry the floors faster. \u201cI realize now that they were her work. Remember, I told you that big shelf in the back room fell on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think that was voodoo?\u201d Lacy\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cCrap. Maybe we should get out the holy water again.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cCouldn\u2019t hurt. But that loaded shelf sure did. It weighed a ton and went over for no reason that I could see. Luckily I have good reflexes and dove under the table back there to avoid the worst of it.\u201d I had actually broken my arm, but it had healed with a good night\u2019s sleep and lots of synthetic blood.</p><p>\u201cThat woman\u2019s crazy if she thinks you\u2019ll just give up your business after a few setbacks. We\u2019ve gone through plenty before, even been firebombed. But we reopened, better than ever. And you and Mr. Blade have gone through a lot. Yet you two have been together for hundreds of years.\u201d Lacy finished and headed back to the storeroom. \u201cI\u2019d better take my to-go bag and scoot. Shift\u2019s over. Will you be okay until the night crew gets here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I expect Megan in a little while. Please get that bag out of here. Are you sure all the mice are gone?\u201d I righted the mannequin and straightened her dress.</p><p>Lacy sniffed. \u201cAll clear. Open the doors. We\u2019re good to go. And be careful. If she really wants Mr. Blade back, she\u2019ll go for you harder next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see her try. A mortal? Bring it on.\u201d I headed for the door, surprised that most of the customers had stuck around. But we were close to Halloween and my shop had great vintage clothing and costumes. I flipped the lock.</p><p>\u201cCome in, everyone. We\u2019re having a sale. All furs, twenty percent off.\u201d That got a reaction, especially since we were having a cold spell. The crowd surged inside. I couldn\u2019t believe I had actually laughed about the crazy woman who\u2019d sworn to get Jeremy Blade back as her lover. A voodoo priestess? Okay, maybe I could buy that. Though I\u2019d never actually seen her, I\u2019d smelled the evil spirits she carried with her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But I could deal with evil. I\u2019d even fought Lucifer and won. You\u2019d think a mortal would be easy compared to him. Right? Wrong. First, Luc and I were both fairly reasonable people. Who knew? But the angel of darkness actually admired my spunk. Melisandra didn\u2019t admire anything about me. She just wanted me gone. In her warped worldview, I was an annoying speed bump on her fast track to bliss with Jerry.</p><p>Obviously she thought that once I was out of the way he would realize she was the one for him. She\u2019d tuned out when he\u2019d told her to take a hike. He had even changed his address and name to get away from her. Mel wanted Jerry and would do anything to get him, even if it meant chaining him in a mausoleum somewhere until he felt the love. I shuddered just thinking about it.</p><p>Of course picturing Jerry as a victim was ridiculous. My guy was strong, an ancient vampire. But I was more than a little aggravated that he\u2019d hooked up with a voodoo queen in the first place. What had he been thinking? More accurately, what had he been thinking with? Men.</p> <p>Despite his faults, I loved him. And I wasn\u2019t about to quit seeing Jerry. Jeremiah Campbell aka Jeremy Blade and I had been through way too much lately for me to call a halt while Mel moved in on him. Instead, I was going to show her just how not scared I was after her little trick.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>\u201cGloriana, you\u2019ve got that look again. What are you thinking?\u201d Jerry arrived less than an hour later. We were going to our favorite club for a little dancing, even meeting friends there. Did you expect us to keep a low profile? That would feel too much like giving in to the wicked witch.</p><p>\u201cThat I\u2019ve got to do something about Mel.\u201d I told him about the mouse invasion.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He put his arm around me. \u201cWhat can I do? I\u2019ve tried to talk to her, but my seeking her out makes her happy, no matter the reason for it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou sure you\u2019ve made it clear you\u2019re done?\u201d I could read his mind and he knew it. But I didn\u2019t even try. We had to trust each other now. I\u2019d come to terms with the fact that this was the man I wanted to be with forever. Not an easy decision. But this complication from his past was ruining what should have been a special time for us. I knew I\u2019d made some big mistakes with my choice of hookups in the past, but a wacko like this?</p><p>\u201cI said, \u2018Go away, I don\u2019t want you.\u2019 Is that clear enough?\u201d He held on to my shoulders, his eyes meeting mine.</p><p>\u201cOuch. Now you\u2019re making me feel sorry for the bitch.\u201d I sighed and leaned against him. \u201cNo wonder she\u2019s acting out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made it clear that she\u2019s not to hurt you or your business.\u201d Jerry rubbed my back. \u201cShe swore she\u2019d back off.\u201d He stared down at me. \u201cAre you sure she\u2019s responsible\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Jerry. Are you under a spell or something? She called to gloat. And then what about this gift box?\u201d I tapped a present I\u2019d received the day before. A voodoo doll. Clich\u00e9 much? Of course it looked like me, though she\u2019d padded the hips until I looked deformed. It was riddled with pins. Bitch. \u201cDid I send it to myself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not. But she laughs at those things. Calls them tourist trinkets. She\u2019s just pulling your chain. Don\u2019t let her play mind games with you.\u201d He pulled me close again. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s go. Try to have some fun. And I won\u2019t meet with her again. Obviously her word means nothing. I\u2019m not sure I can think straight when I\u2019m around her now because I\u2019m so damned sick of her and her tricks. She infuriates me, thinking she can just force me to take her back. I\u2019m surprised I haven\u2019t already put an end to her.\u201d</p> <p>I stiffened and pushed back staring into his dark eyes. He meant what he said. If Jerry hadn\u2019t been able to act on his homicidal impulses, then Mel must be working some kind of magic to keep him under control. I wasn\u2019t about to tell Jer I thought he was being handled by a woman with superior skills. But I knew I had powers and experience with evil that he didn\u2019t have. \u201cThat cinches it. I want a face-to-face with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlory, you and Mel in the same room? A recipe for disaster. She won\u2019t back down and you\u2019ll probably lose it.\u201d Jerry pulled me close again. \u201cYou aren\u2019t the kind of person who can just rip out a throat and walk away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d probably taste like raw sewage anyway.\u201d I\u2019d had a whiff of her when she\u2019d spied on Jerry and me, lurked in the bushes outside his house. Stalker. She\u2019d smelled like burnt sugar, evil left too long on the stove. I really didn\u2019t want to get close enough to her to touch her. Why didn\u2019t she just crawl back to Miami and pick a man who wanted her? I wasn\u2019t giving up on the idea of a meeting but figured Jerry was never going to like the idea.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. Our friends are probably already at the club. Your pal Israel Caine and Sienna Star are supposed to sing their new duet tonight.\u201d Jerry tugged me toward the back door.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that? Are you actually communicating with Ray or Rafe?\u201d I rested my hand on Jerry\u2019s chest. This was unlikely. Jerry was jealous of both guys because he knew I\u2019d had a special relationship with each of them. They were still my friends, but had been more than that in the past. I\u2019d made it clear to both of them that I was with Jerry now.</p><p>\u201cRichard told me. He and Flo get a newsletter from the club with the coming attractions. I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t get it.\u201d Jerry pulled open the back door, pausing to check out the security like he always did. \u201cCome on. We don\u2019t have much time. Caine doesn\u2019t float my boat, but I know he does yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got that right.\u201d I laughed when I saw his face. \u201cOh, come on. We both enjoy good music. I\u2019m way behind on e-mail or I\u2019d have seen the newsletter myself and dragged you there.\u201d I grabbed his hand and we hurried down the alley toward N-V, the club my former bodyguard Rafe now owned. It wasn\u2019t far and the shifter stationed at the door waved us in ahead of the line at the door. We settled at a table with my best bud, Florence da Vinci, and her husband, Richard Mainwaring. Then we ordered synthetic blood with alcohol, stocked here for us by Rafe, and settled back to watch the show.</p><p>\u201cAmica, how are you doing? Any more disastros in your shop?\u201d Flo leaned in to whisper.</p> <p>\u201cNightly. That bitch won\u2019t give up.\u201d I told her about the mice and she shuddered.</p><p>\u201cThat could ruin your business. I know I would never go back to a place where I saw topi.\u201d Flo patted my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cMe either.\u201d I sniffed the air. \u201cWhat perfume are you wearing, Flo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Ricardo says it destroys his defense. He needs to smell the enemy coming.\u201d She stroked her husband\u2019s arm. \u201cHe takes very good care of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet she\u2019s lurking around here right now. Following us.\u201d I glanced around. If he were a woman, Jerry would have pictures of her on his phone, but I\u2019d never seen him snap a photo. Too bad.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Flo grabbed Richard. \u201cRicardo! Glory says the bitch is here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d He leaned forward. \u201cBlade, do you see her?\u201d</p><p>Jerry stood and scanned the crowded balcony. \u201cNot up here.\u201d He sniffed the air. \u201cThere\u2019s a faint whiff . . . I\u2019m going downstairs to check it out. Richard, you stay here with the ladies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re all going.\u201d I got up.</p><p>\u201cHere? Puttana!\u201d Flo glanced around the narrow balcony. \u201cWe will make that creature sorry she bothers our Glory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t taunt her, Flo.\u201d I squeezed Flo\u2019s hand. \u201cShe\u2019s got some mean tricks up her sleeve. I told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMice, falling shelves. Child\u2019s play.\u201d Flo\u2019s eyes gleamed. \u201cI say we can take whatever she dishes out. Ti credi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d I smiled at her, feeling better than I had in days. The band was taking the stage, the people on the dance floor surging forward as we headed for the stairs. It was Ray\u2019s band and I knew the guys from a time when I\u2019d pretended to be engaged to the rocker. Publicity stunt. I\u2019d been Ray\u2019s mentor right after he\u2019d been turned vampire. Had even been his date to the Grammys. It had been a magical night. I could use another one about now.</p><p>\u201cI heard Ray and Sienna are a couple now.\u201d Flo studied me for a reaction as we stopped on the stairs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad. He needed someone.\u201d I saw Jerry and Richard waiting for us.</p><p>\u201cNo sign of her.\u201d Jerry held out his hand. \u201cLet\u2019s just enjoy the show. I can get us closer to the stage. Follow me.\u201d He rubbed the back of my neck. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Did you know Ray and Sienna are together and not just to sing?\u201d I stayed close to him as we eased around the crowd and the lights dimmed.</p><p>\u201cGlad to hear it. Keeps him away from you.\u201d Jerry kissed my cheek. \u201cBut he\u2019s stupid to pick a mortal. He\u2019ll screw it up, mark my words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush, Jer, they\u2019re getting ready to start.\u201d Very afraid he was right, I slipped my arm around his waist as we found a spot close to the stage. Ray was reckless, impulsive and a fairly new vampire. Sleeping with a mortal could have consequences and none of them were good. The house went dark except for spotlights on Ray at the piano and Sienna leaning against it. They started singing and you could have heard a mouse squeak in the huge club. The song was beautiful, the lyrics haunting. The way the two sang to each other, it was clear this love song had meaning for both of them.</p><p>Jerry turned me into his arms and we danced, making the song ours too. I was sure all the lovers in the audience felt the same way. He held me against him, his hands sliding down to rest on my butt as we moved slowly. I laid my cheek on his chest, my fingers delving into his hair while I breathed him in. We were together and no bitch from hell was going to pull us apart. If Mel was nearby, she could just watch and see how much we loved each other. I was sorry when the song ended.</p><p>\u201cWow. Meraviglioso! It makes me want to take you home and ravish you, Ricardo.\u201d Next to us, Flo kissed Richard on the lips. \u201cWhat do you think, Glory?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d I sighed, struggling to come back to earth. For a few moments it had been great just to dance and forget everyone but Jerry. I squeezed his hand. Ray and Sienna jumped up to sing together again. They put their arms around each other, bumping hips as they danced, and sang a rock song this time, Ray\u2019s band backing them up. It was high energy and fun.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Jerry said softly into my ear.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d I turned and ran my hand over his jaw. \u201cFlo\u2019s right. That song put me in the mood to make love to you. What do you think?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI could handle that.\u201d He grinned and pulled me toward the door. \u201cWe\u2019re out of here.\u201d He nodded to Richard.</p><p>\u201cRight behind you.\u201d Richard hauled a giggling Flo up into his arms and followed us. \u201cCaine has a hit on his hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRicardo, put me down.\u201d She hit his shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re embarrassing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese kids think it\u2019s funny. Look at them.\u201d He grinned and nodded. Sure enough, his stunt helped clear a path for us to the front door. Once I thought I caught a whiff of that sweet, nasty smell again but I never saw anyone fitting Mel\u2019s description. Then we were outside, the fresh October air a welcome relief after the crowd inside.</p><p>\u201cSee you later.\u201d Richard set Flo on her feet then hurried her toward his car, ignoring her protests about manners. He had a look that promised a passionate night for them both.</p> <p>\u201cWell, now what?\u201d I grinned at Jerry. \u201cYou know I have a roommate.\u201d And she was a terror. No way was I dragging my man home to that.</p><p>\u201cCome home with me. They don\u2019t need you in the shop again tonight, do they?\u201d He pulled me toward his car parked down the street.</p><p>\u201cNot unless Mel unleashes another invasion. Roaches maybe?\u201d I shuddered then patted my pocket. \u201cI\u2019ve got my cell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d He glanced around. \u201cIf that woman knows what\u2019s good for her, she\u2019ll leave you alone. This isn\u2019t the way to win my heart.\u201d He helped me into his convertible, then settled in, hitting a button to let the top down before steering into traffic. The cool air felt good and I let the wind blow my worries away.</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t understand how you ever got involved with a woman like Melisandra Du Monde.\u201d My comment made Jerry\u2019s hands tighten on the steering wheel. We were stopped at a red light.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a strong woman and there is something about her . . .\u201d He punched a button and the CD player came on. Trying to distract me? I punched it back off.</p> <p>\u201cCome on, Jerry, try to explain. This is important to me.\u201d I twisted under my seat belt to face him.</p><p>\u201cRight. So can you explain why Israel Caine has your panties in a twist every time you see him?\u201d He gave me a knowing nod, like he\u2019d made a point, before he stepped on the gas.</p><p>\u201cI guess so. He has musical talent and I\u2019m a sucker for that. He\u2019s handsome, tall, has those piercing blue eyes that make a woman feel\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough. I really don\u2019t want to hear a catalog of Caine\u2019s fine qualities. Mel got to me. She has a way of looking at a man that makes him feel powerful. Like he\u2019s a sex god.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear you\u2019re blushing.\u201d And I swear I was getting pissed. Well, I\u2019d asked for it.</p><p>\u201cYou make me feel that way too, Gloriana.\u201d He reached out and snagged my hand. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to protect you because you make me feel like I\u2019m invincible. It\u2019s something a man needs\u2014to be wanted, looked up to.\u201d He kissed my knuckles. \u201cYou and Mel have more in common than you know. But you\u2019re two sides of a coin. You\u2019re the good side. I discovered too late that she\u2019s the bad one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, gosh, Jer.\u201d I glanced around and realized we were in his neighborhood, almost to his house. \u201cThis is bizarre and yet I understand what you\u2019re saying. It\u2019s like when a man makes me feel that I\u2019m the most desirable woman in the world.\u201d I pulled our joined hands to my lips and ran my tongue across his knuckles. \u201cYou always do that to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t just see you as a sex object. I hope you know that.\u201d He pulled the car up in front of the garage and hit a button on the remote. He turned to face me as we waited for the door to open. \u201cYou are much more to me than a way to get my rocks off.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBack at you.\u201d I smiled and popped off my seat belt, leaning over to kiss him. I crawled right over the console to make sure I could reach his mouth and give it my full attention. The steering wheel cut into my back but I didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s put the car away and go upstairs.\u201d He gently lifted me off of him and drove the car into the garage.</p><p>I let him pull me out of the car and then followed him to the house. The garage door came down and we stepped into the kitchen. The house was quiet and smelled faintly of the cleaning supplies his housekeeper used. It was reassuring. At least Mel hadn\u2019t managed to come inside his home yet.</p><p>Jerry lifted me into his arms and was about to carry me upstairs to his bedroom when my cell phone buzzed in my pocket.</p><p>\u201cOh, no!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIgnore it.\u201d He leaned down to kiss me then strode toward the staircase.</p><p>The buzzing was insistent before the call went to voice mail. I gently shoved at Jerry\u2019s chest when he stopped at the bottom of the stairs. \u201cLet me check the message. I told them not to call unless it was an emergency in the shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead.\u201d He set me on my feet. \u201cI\u2019ll be upstairs in my office checking e-mail. Come and get me when you\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCount on it.\u201d I jerked my phone out of my pocket. The voice mail was from a number I didn\u2019t recognize. I hit play and pulled the phone to my ear.</p><p>\u201cIf you want our lover to live, you will meet me tonight. Be in the alley behind your shop in thirty minutes. Believe me, I would rather put a stake through his heart than see him with you forevermore.\u201d</p><p>I recognized the voice instantly, smooth yet determined. So I\u2019d finally get a face-to-face with Melisandra. If I was lucky, I could finish this once and for all. Either she saw the light, realized he was never going to be hers, or she was going down. Permanently. One problem. What was I going to tell Jerry? He\u2019d never let me meet her alone if he knew about it. I looked up the stairs toward his office. Damn. I really wanted to forget this woman\u2019s demands and enjoy an evening in Jerry\u2019s arms. But she was just crazy enough to kill him rather than let me have him.</p><p>Did I really believe my man couldn\u2019t handle her? I leaned against the banister, suddenly weak in the knees. Maybe he could, but I wasn\u2019t willing to take that chance. I\u2019d almost lost Jerry recently and it had been the worst time of my life. No way was I going to risk that again. Who knew what kind of tricks a voodoo priestess could pull?</p><p>So I put on my game face and headed up. I hadn\u2019t told Jerry, but in the nights before the voodoo doll had arrived I\u2019d had strange pains in my body in the exact spots where those pins had been in it. He\u2019d still been in Miami then and I hadn\u2019t known about Mel yet. Only hindsight made me realize the pains and the pins went together. Obviously this woman was more powerful than we realized.</p><p>Lying to Jerry was nothing new, even though I hated it. I invented a problem in the shop then kissed him good-bye until he was ready to carry me to bed anyway. Laughing, I promised him a date later. I just hoped that wasn\u2019t another lie.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>I was on high alert when I flew into the alley behind my shop. The smell hit me immediately. It was bad enough that Mugs and Muffins was baking at this time of night, but added to the sugary muffin scent was that overpowering reek of evil. Melisandra was waiting for me.</p><p>\u201cYou must be Gloriana St. Clair.\u201d The husky voice came out of the darkness near my parked car. I heard the click of high heels as a woman strolled into the light. A breeze brought the unmistakable evidence that she was mortal. She trailed her hand over the trunk, the smile on her face making me shiver.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to ask who you are, skulking here in the dark.\u201d I\u2019d hoped Jerry had been exaggerating, but she was beautiful, her dusky skin the color of milk chocolate. Her long black hair tumbled to her shoulders, and her unusual gray green eyes, framed by long lashes, examined me like she could see right down to my soul. I straightened my own shoulders when all I wanted to do was shift again and head back to Jerry\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cYes, I am Melisandra Du Monde. I\u2019ve been wanting to meet you for a long time, Gloriana. Gloriana. Ah, yes, the most interesting Gloriana.\u201d My name had become a chant. She gestured with her right hand, her scarlet nails gathering air around her.</p><p>I stepped back before I could stop myself when that air swirled and darkened around her. Magic. I recognized it and quit breathing, sure inhaling it would sear my lungs and either muddle my senses or make me pass out. I glanced around, almost expecting some familiar demons to leap out from behind the cars to sing backup for her.</p><p>Hey, I was no ordinary vampire. I could take her. Malicious tricks or not, she could die. I couldn\u2019t. I smiled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen your handiwork in my shop, Mel. Do you really think those stunts are going to help your cause with Jerry? So far you\u2019ve just pissed him off on my behalf.\u201d I couldn\u2019t help noticing her voluptuous figure under a sharp black business suit that came from a well-known designer. She would have fit right in at a conference table in any Fortune 500 company. She was just Jerry\u2019s type with full breasts and generous hips. Only her eyes betrayed the crazy beneath her professional demeanor. \u201cHe really doesn\u2019t like to see me upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Were you? Upset?\u201d She blew on her palm and dust peppered my face, making my eyes burn. \u201cThat makes me very happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear me?\u201d I blinked to clear my vision, refusing to rub my eyes which stung like a son of a bitch. \u201cYour dirty tricks are alienating Jerry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll get over it.\u201d She smiled. \u201cWhen we\u2019re back together, Jeremiah will forget all about you. I have ways to ensure it. I know what he likes, you see.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGet a grip on reality. He kicked you to the curb a long time ago. Where\u2019s your pride, woman?\u201d Taunting her probably wasn\u2019t my best move, but I really didn\u2019t like being reminded that she\u2019d had Jerry in her bed. I was trying not to lose my cool and jump her, rip out that beautiful hair and pound her head against the concrete. That would make me feel better but would probably give her the out-of-control reaction she was hoping for. I drew on every reserve I had and stared at her, trying for cold and disdainful.</p><p>\u201cDid he tell you how we met, Gloriana?\u201d She leaned against my car, drawing a line with her nail on the trunk.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I wanted to hear this.</p> <p>\u201cI had rented a ballroom at his hotel in Miami. It was a sellout. People pay small fortunes to hear me speak, get motivated.\u201d She smiled, her red lipstick perfect. All of her makeup was perfect. Damn.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine. What do they say? A sucker is born every minute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am worth every penny. As a life coach. People hear me speak and they are reborn. They leave my seminars and become successful, do great things.\u201d She flicked a disdainful look at the back door to my shop. \u201cSome people are satisfied with a little life. My clients are not. Check out my Web site. Read the testimonials.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know nothing about me or my life.\u201d Why didn\u2019t I just rip out her throat now? But that would make me as evil as she was. And then there was that cold, malignant wall surrounding her. I\u2019d be stained by it, my soul tarnished, if I gave in to my urge to kill her.</p><p>\u201cYou have worked your vampire wiles on my Jeremiah. But I will put an end to that. Then he will realize that I am his soul mate. The only woman to make him truly happy.\u201d She ran a fingertip down her throat. \u201cYou should see him when he drinks my blood, Gloriana. The pleasure, the passion\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShut the hell up!\u201d I vibrated with the need to tear her apart. Her smile was so sure, triumphant. Had Jerry actually kissed that mouth? I wanted to retch, or launch myself across the alley and obliterate her face so that she\u2019d never kiss anyone, ever again.</p><p>No.</p><p>I forced a laugh. \u201cSeriously? Don\u2019t you realize vampires will do and say anything to get mortal blood? Jerry played you, bitch. Used you as a donor and then moved on.\u201d I took a step toward her. \u201cYou were handy when he was in Miami, but that\u2019s over. He\u2019s lusty, I can attest to that. Obviously you were easy.\u201d I gave her my own cold smile. She didn\u2019t take it well, her teeth snapping together. If she\u2019d been a vampire, she would have been snarling, her fangs down. \u201cNow he\u2019s got his number-one lover back. Me. You are old news, Mel. He\u2019s throwing you out with the trash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOld news? I\u2019m not the one with hundreds of years invested in a failed relationship, Gloriana. Pobresita.\u201d The air around her swirled and pushed at me, frigid and menacing. \u201cYou are a bad habit that Jeremiah needs to break. But once you are gone, he will be all mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet a grip. Jerry\u2019s not some trophy you can pass around, the prize in your pissing contest. He\u2019s a man who knows what he wants and it\u2019s not you. Now, why don\u2019t you go back where you came from? Find some other man to terrorize.\u201d I shoved at her creepy air and met resistance. I hated that I was even arguing with her, sounding desperate. Damn it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d like that, wouldn\u2019t you? For me to just leave him to you?\u201d She raised her arms and howling creatures appeared around her. Spirits? Ghosts? Whatever, they gave me the creeps. \u201cAs long as you are between me and happiness, Gloriana St. Clair, you will never have peace of your own. This I vow.\u201d She muttered an incantation and the restless things around her wailed louder, rising and falling as she got more agitated. They zipped past me, tearing at my hair and snatching at my clothes.</p> <p>Okay, I admit it. I hit at them like they were real and got nothing but air. It was all I could do not to dematerialize, just vanish the hell out of there. I reminded myself that I was dealing with nothing more than a mortal playing with the dead. Yeah, dead. How much could they really hurt me? The ghosts I\u2019d dealt with before had been benign, helpful. But the chilled air brushing against me when one of those howling creatures darted past made me jump in spite of myself.</p><p>\u201cAll right, you want to play hardball? It\u2019s on.\u201d I showed fang. \u201cI don\u2019t think you know who you\u2019re messing with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will see.\u201d She threw her arms wide and my ears rang as her followers screeched a final time, twirling into some kind of otherworldly dust devil before they disappeared. \u201cHe will be mine, Gloriana. It is decided.\u201d</p><p>Decided? I couldn\u2019t stand it. I threw myself at her, finally giving in to my hatred. I landed on empty concrete. She\u2019d disappeared, just poofed. I jumped up and took a quick look around. She must have had an escape route figured out because she was really gone, nothing left of her but that stench of bad news.</p><p>I leaned against the back door into the shop, my stomach doing a pitch and roll as I hit the code for security and practically fell into the storeroom. I needed a bottle of synthetic blood. The first gulp helped, the second felt even better. A voodoo priestess. What next? I should know better than to ask that question.</p><p>Two</p><p>My phone buzzed in my pocket. I was almost afraid to answer it. Here it came. Cosmic payback. Caller ID made me feel a little better.</p><p>\u201cRay? That duet tonight was amazing.\u201d I smiled as I said it. A good memory to wipe out the bad.</p> <p>\u201cGlory, babe. I\u2019m in a shitload of trouble here.\u201d Ray\u2019s voice shook and I could have sworn he sobbed. I sank down in my one chair in the back room.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Sienna. We came back to my place after the concert. Hit the sheets, had some fun and then I did the whammy on her so I could drink her blood. You know, my idea of a nightcap these days.\u201d He sniffed.</p><p>\u201cRay, what the hell happened?\u201d I gripped my phone so hard the pink sparkles on the case cut into my palm.</p><p>\u201cI drank too much blood, Glo. I can\u2019t wake up Sienna. I think, I think she\u2019s dead. Come out here, Glory. Quick. Help me.\u201d He took a shuddery breath. \u201cI might be able to save her if I turn her vampire but I can\u2019t do it alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way.\u201d I stuck my phone in my pocket and threw open the back door, barely taking the time to lock it again. If Sienna was already dead, we were too late. If she had a little life left in her . . . I shifted and flew into the night sky. Either way, Ray and I were in a hell of a mess. And I\u2019d thought voodoo was my biggest problem.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>I landed next to Ray\u2019s front door. One of his bodyguards, Will, met me and let me in immediately. I knew all of them, thanks to my history with the rocker. Will Kilpatrick was a Scot, and knew me better than most.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s really shook up, Glory. They\u2019re in the master bedroom. I tried to help him, but he insisted we wait for you.\u201d Will stayed right on my heels as I ran through the house.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think? Is there hope for her?\u201d I hesitated in front of the closed door, dread making my stomach churn.</p><p>\u201cMaybe. But you never know. We should have done something right away. But Ray wouldn\u2019t hear of it. Had to call you.\u201d Will reached around me and opened the door. \u201cGood luck. You need me, give a shout. I don\u2019t have to tell you what this means if the girl doesn\u2019t make it, do I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither way, Ray\u2019s really screwed up this time.\u201d I took a breath of courage and ran into the room. It was bathed in moonlight, the centerpiece of the large room a king-size bed with black satin sheets in a tangle, the dark comforter in a heap on the floor at the foot. Ray jumped up, his eyes wild as he dragged me over to where Sienna lay in the middle of the bed.</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019s got a faint pulse but I can\u2019t rouse her.\u201d He jammed my finger against her pale throat. \u201cFeel. Isn\u2019t there a heartbeat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRay, calm down.\u201d I could see that she wasn\u2019t breathing but that didn\u2019t mean she was dead. I concentrated, listening for that subtle thump that meant her heart still beat. Yes, she was in there somewhere but didn\u2019t have long.</p><p>\u201cGod, Glory, I never meant for this to happen.\u201d He hovered over me, his hand on my back as I leaned closer, trying to feel for a whisper of breath.</p><p>\u201cBring me a mirror, Ray. I think she may be breathing after all. Hurry.\u201d I reached out and he slapped a silver hand mirror into it. Sienna\u2019s. Ray would never own a feminine piece like this. I held it over her nose and got just a bit of cloud. \u201cGood news. She\u2019s not gone yet, but there\u2019s no way to avoid it. We have to give her blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we take her to the hospital? Or give her some synthetic? Or is this it? Will we have to turn her?\u201d Ray sagged onto the side of the bed, his shoulders drooping. \u201cI swore I\u2019d never do this. Never turn another person. Not after what was done to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have a choice, Ray. Look at her. I can almost see her soul leaving her body.\u201d I leaned down and put my head to her chest. \u201cHer heart\u2019s starting to skip beats. We can\u2019t take the time to get her to the hospital for a real transfusion, and synthetic won\u2019t save her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d He picked up Sienna\u2019s hand then shuddered. \u201cShe\u2019s so damned cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSynthetic isn\u2019t real blood. It can keep us going, but a human\u2019s not equipped to metabolize it.\u201d I was quoting one of the vampire doctors I knew. \u201cYou want me to do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. I\u2019m sorry, but I just can\u2019t.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t let go of her hand. \u201cSave her, Glory. I hope to hell this is the right thing to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. Right or wrong, I don\u2019t see an alternative.\u201d I picked up her other wrist. First step, drain her completely. I\u2019d done this once before, when I\u2019d come across a woman bleeding out in my alley. It had turned out I\u2019d have been doing myself, Ray and the world in general a favor if I\u2019d left Lucky Carver to die. Instead I\u2019d played Good Samaritan and saved her skinny ass. At least I knew Sienna for a decent person who deserved to live. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But how would she feel about waking up a vampire? Ray had been horrified, waking up with fangs, and still hated some aspects of being a vampire. I guess we\u2019d find out what Sienna thought about this deal when\u2014oh, God, if\u2014she woke up. I fought back a wave of nausea and tried to remember I was the old pro here. Ray and Sienna were counting on me.</p><p>\u201cStand by, Ray. Watch what I do. You never know when you might need to know this.\u201d I said a quick prayer, then set about making my second vampire. Saving Sienna\u2019s life or not, this was so permanent. There would be no going back.</p><p>First, I bit into her wrist, sucking on her vein. There was pitifully little blood, a sign that we really didn\u2019t have a choice. No reaction, not even a moan, as I drained her. Ray? He was beside himself, cursing and pacing around the bed.</p> <p>Once I was satisfied that she was empty, I sat up and bit into my own wrist. It hurt like hell, but I didn\u2019t have a choice. This next step was important.</p><p>\u201cHold up her head, Ray. I\u2019ve got to get her to drink from me.\u201d I ran my bleeding wrist across her lips which were now almost blue. No reaction, of course. Mortals don\u2019t have a natural hunger for our blood. A vampire would have gone for it instantly. Even Ray\u2019s fangs were down and the idiot had already drunk his fill tonight. He sat behind Sienna and settled her head in his lap, tenderly stroking her short hair back from her forehead.</p><p>I had already noticed that he wore nothing but his trademark black silk boxers and had to remind myself that I wasn\u2019t here to appreciate his beautiful body or remember . . .</p><p>\u201cHow will you get her to drink?\u201d Ray didn\u2019t spare me a glance. He couldn\u2019t look away from Sienna\u2019s pale face.</p><p>\u201cOpen her mouth, force it open if you have to. I\u2019m going to drip it down her throat and make her swallow. Once we get enough in her, she\u2019ll come alive, vampire style, and begin to drink on her own. Or at least that\u2019s what happened with Lucky, when I turned her.\u201d I watched while Ray jammed a finger into her mouth and pried open her teeth. It was like working on a doll. Sienna was still lifeless.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, you did turn that skank. At least it gave you the experience to help Sienna.\u201d He kept brushing Sienna\u2019s hair back from her face. Rock star. Sienna had gone for platinum with pink stripes this year. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to save her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Ray. Just keep her mouth open.\u201d I squeezed my wrist to increase the amount of blood that dripped into her mouth. Then I rubbed her throat until I saw her swallow. She coughed and gagged.</p><p>\u201cHold her mouth closed now, we can\u2019t let her lose that.\u201d I watched her carefully. She settled down but was still unconscious. \u201cOkay, open it again, I\u2019m giving her some more.\u201d I couldn\u2019t remember how much blood I\u2019d had to give Lucky back then. I\u2019d been crazy with fear, caught off guard and forced by circumstances to turn a human I didn\u2019t even know into a vampire. This was different.</p><p>I felt almost clinical, like a doctor myself, detached, watching for signs, waiting to see if this worked. It was a freaky feeling and I didn\u2019t like it. I should be more upset, like Ray was, shaking and calling Sienna\u2019s name as he cradled her head between his thighs.</p><p>\u201cAre you feeling woozy? You don\u2019t look so hot, Glory.\u201d Ray finally spared me a glance. \u201cWill, get in here!\u201d he shouted as I swayed over Sienna. \u201cBring Glory a bottle of the premium synthetic. Quick!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Good idea. I can\u2019t keep giving her blood and not get some to replace it.\u201d I\u2019d been standing, leaning over Sienna. Now I sat down on the bed, hard. No wonder I hadn\u2019t felt much about this. It had been almost like an out-of-body experience.</p> <p>Will showed up on the run, a bottle of AB negative in his hand. He twisted off the top and handed it to me. \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s still not coming around.\u201d Ray glanced from me to Will. \u201cMaybe Will should take over. Give her his blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I think that might confuse her. I\u2019m going to be her sire.\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure about that. Frankly I wasn\u2019t thinking straight. But it seemed like the sire blood bond was kind of important. More important than any of us vampires wanted to admit. Switching donors in mid-transition didn\u2019t seem like a good idea.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d I drained the bottle. It really helped and gave me the energy to continue.</p><p>\u201cShe looks better to me. You guys probably don\u2019t see it, but I think there\u2019s a tinge of pink in her cheeks already.\u201d Will stayed near the foot of the bed. \u201cA little more should take care of it, Glory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re right.\u201d I bit into my other wrist this time and pressed it to Sienna\u2019s lips. Ray held her mouth open enough to allow another few ounces to dribble in. We all watched and waited as I rubbed her throat until she swallowed. Sienna should begin to drink on her own soon. If this was working. If she didn\u2019t, then we\u2019d been too late and it was time to admit she was dead, Will\u2019s pink cheeks wishful thinking.</p><p>I felt a tickle against my wrist then pressure as her lips pressed against my wrist. Suction! \u201cShe\u2019s drinking!\u201d I blinked, startled to realize I was actually crying with relief.</p><p>Sure enough, Sienna suddenly grabbed my wrist with both hands and latched on, a growl of pleasure rumbling up from her chest. She took a deep pull, starving. It was the same reaction I\u2019d gotten from Lucky. I remembered it now. I had to be careful. Too much and I\u2019d end up a victim and she\u2019d be more vampire than she needed to be at first. Wild, out of control.</p> <p>Of course it was important that we watch her for the next night or two. The transition wasn\u2019t easy. And she didn\u2019t have a clue that vampires even existed. Or did she?</p><p>\u201cRay, does Sienna know you\u2019re a vampire?\u201d I nodded toward Will and he helped me break Sienna\u2019s hold on my wrist. She opened her eyes and stared into mine. I caught her gaze and talked to her calmly. \u201cSleep now, Sienna. It\u2019s almost dawn.\u201d I relaxed when I saw her blink, close her eyes with a sigh then settle into sleep. \u201cRay? I asked you a question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Hell, no. I told you I mesmerized her to drink. I was working up to tell her, even hinted at it, but she always laughed off that stuff. She likes to read fantasy stuff, you know, books about vamps and shifters. But she never bought into it for real. I finally decided it wasn\u2019t a good idea. Not like how it went with Nate.\u201d Ray eased out from under Sienna and covered her with a sheet. No one had commented on the fact that the woman had been wearing nothing at all. Will was smart enough to look everywhere but at his boss\u2019s lady friend.</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess that means I stay here tonight and help you tomorrow night. Because we\u2019re going to have to explain our life to her. And it\u2019s not a laughing matter.\u201d I sat on the foot of the bed. \u201cI could use another bottle of that premium.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it.\u201d Will raced out of the room, obviously eager to get out of the way.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to take it badly. Like I did.\u201d Ray collapsed next to me. \u201cShit. I can\u2019t believe I did this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s done. No good will come from beating yourself up about it. We\u2019ll do the best we can to help her with the transition. She\u2019ll probably be mad at you, not want to be with you at first.\u201d I put my hand on his shoulder. \u201cI may have to take her home with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d do that?\u201d Ray kissed my cheek. \u201cDamn, girl, there\u2019s just no end to your generosity, is there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, there\u2019s an end. You do this again and I\u2019m going to make you sorry you ever got that pair of fangs, Israel Caine.\u201d I gave him a hard look. \u201cI can turn you to a statue and leave you there until the sun comes up. Make you fry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTough talk, Glory.\u201d He grinned and ran a finger down my arm. \u201cBut you know you love me, sweet thing. And this has taught me a hard lesson.\u201d He lost his smile. \u201cI\u2019m done with mortals. I like Sienna. But I\u2019m not in love with her, not like I was with you. Now I\u2019ve ruined her life. And it was just so I could enjoy a drink at her fountain.\u201d He jumped up and stared at the night sky, visible through the glass doors that led out to his terrace.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if you ruined it, Ray.\u201d I didn\u2019t like where this was going. Ray was volatile at the best of times. As an alcoholic, recovering now, he was always close to falling off the wagon again.</p><p>He faced the bed once more. \u201cI know what I am. A selfish bastard. I\u2019ve got to stop using people. I will stop. Helping Sienna . . . Well, maybe that\u2019s something I have to do to learn what\u2019s important in my life.\u201d He watched me, obviously hoping for approval.</p><p>\u201cI wish you meant that, Ray. But instead I feel like I\u2019m listening to one of your song lyrics.\u201d I was tired, drained, and I\u2019d heard his vows of change before. \u201cI\u2019m going to bed. Good night.\u201d</p><p>I left him standing there with his mouth hanging open, for once realizing his charm had deserted him. Good. I met Will in the hall, where he handed me another bottle of the good stuff.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost dawn. There\u2019s a guest room right here.\u201d He led me to it. \u201cAnything you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo call Jerry. I won\u2019t tell him about this yet. It will just reinforce his poor opinion of Ray. But he had been expecting me to come back to his house.\u201d I opened the door to a neat bedroom with a queen-size bed. It must be nice to be rich enough to hire paranormals to clean your house while you slept.</p><p>\u201cDo you think we should notify the vampire council about this?\u201d Will stood in the doorway as I kicked off my shoes.</p><p>\u201cIt was an emergency. I know they have rules about making new vampires, but this was life or death. Of course Ray made a mistake, no getting around that. Dumbass.\u201d I sat on the foot of the bed and drank my synthetic. \u201cI\u2019ll call Damian myself tomorrow night and explain things. First, let\u2019s see how Sienna takes the news that she now has fangs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOdds are she won\u2019t be thrilled. Only those of us who grew up in families of vampires knew what we were getting into.\u201d Will was from a Highland clan, neighbor to Jerry\u2019s Clan Campbell. Their parents were \u201cmade\u201d vampires, who then turned their adult children when they chose to become vampire. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably right, Will. I\u2019m not looking forward to it.\u201d I sighed and pulled out my cell phone.</p><p>\u201cYou did a fine job tonight, Glory. Saved her life. Now we\u2019ll see whether she\u2019s going to thank you for it.\u201d He smiled and closed the door, leaving me to my bed and death sleep as dawn drew closer.</p><p>Would she? Thank me? And did I want to take her home with me if she needed to get away from Ray? Too many questions for my tired brain. I stripped and crawled into bed, called Jerry and made up a story about shop complications, then cratered. Tomorrow was soon enough to worry about all of that.</p> <p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>I woke up to peace and quiet. Okay, either Sienna still slept or Ray hadn\u2019t told her the news. Was he waiting for me to do it? I wouldn\u2019t be surprised. I glanced at the bedside clock and realized I\u2019d slept past sunset. Unusual for me, but then I\u2019d lost a lot of blood last night. Not even two bottles of synthetic could make up for how exhausting the stress and blood loss had been.</p><p>My cell phone rang and I picked it up off the nightstand. I saw at a glance that this wasn\u2019t the first call I\u2019d received. Two voice mails waited for me. I just answered.</p><p>\u201cJerry? Sorry, I overslept.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you? I\u2019m at your apartment and Aggie says you didn\u2019t sleep here last night.\u201d</p> <p>Aggie was my roommate. She didn\u2019t know when to keep her mouth shut. In more ways than one. More about that later. \u201cI\u2019m at Ray\u2019s. He almost killed Sienna. Drank too much of her blood. I . . . I had to turn her vampire, Jerry.\u201d I suddenly choked up, the reality of what I\u2019d done hitting me.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right? Gloriana, are you still there? At Caine\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I had to sleep in his guest room. So I\u2019d be here when she woke up.\u201d I sniffled, getting myself under control. \u201cI\u2019m her sire, Jerry. I have to check on her, help explain to her about vampires. She doesn\u2019t even know we exist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming out there. You sound like you need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. Thanks.\u201d I ended the call. I\u2019m usually strong but for some reason this was getting to me and I liked the idea of Jerry beside me. I pulled on my clothes, wishing desperately for some clean underwear, and washed my face in the adjoining bathroom. I hated to be seen without makeup. Maybe if Sienna still slept I could borrow some of hers. A hairbrush would be nice too. I did find a new toothbrush and toothpaste in a drawer though.</p><p>Feeling almost presentable, I opened the bedroom door and walked down the hall toward the master bedroom. At the last moment I changed my mind and headed to the kitchen instead. I needed some of Ray\u2019s premium synthetic first. I still felt a little weak. Or was that fluttery feeling in my stomach dread? I wouldn\u2019t be surprised.</p> <p>\u201cGood evening.\u201d Will sat on a bar stool, sipping from a mug of synthetic. Obviously he\u2019d heated his in the microwave. I liked mine cold.</p><p>\u201cNothing from the new vampire yet?\u201d I opened the fridge and helped myself, twisting off the cap and taking a deep swallow.</p><p>\u201cNot a peep. I figure Ray is up and just watching her.\u201d He gestured with his mug. \u201cI can nuke that for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine.\u201d I drank some more. \u201cGuess I\u2019d better go see what\u2019s happening.\u201d I glanced up at a rap on the French doors that led to the deck outside. \u201cIt\u2019s Jerry. That was fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd one of the guards.\u201d Will grinned and walked over to unlock the door. He spoke to the guard who stood back but didn\u2019t leave. \u201cAre you here in peace or do I send you on your way again, Jeremiah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just here to see Gloriana.\u201d Jerry frowned at Will. They were old friends but Will knew Jerry was not one of Ray\u2019s fans. \u201cI\u2019ll not bother your boss as long as he doesn\u2019t bother me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has much more on his mind tonight than you or your lady, Jeremiah.\u201d Will nodded and the other guard took off. \u201cCome in. I\u2019d count it as a courtesy if you\u2019d leave your knives here in the kitchen before you go with Glory back to see Caine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to be kidding.\u201d Jerry glanced at me. \u201cGloriana?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHumor him, Jer. He\u2019s just doing his job. Surely you can respect that.\u201d I walked up to him and put my arms around his waist, coming away with the knife he always kept at the small of his back. \u201cHere\u2019s one, Will.\u201d I set it on the counter.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Gloriana.\u201d Jerry scowled but leaned over and pulled a knife from his boot and set it beside the other one.</p><p>\u201cGive me the one under your arm as well.\u201d Will grinned. \u201cCome on, you know Ray is going to say or do something that will make you go for his throat, it\u2019s his way. I can\u2019t have you tossing one of your knives into the mix.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right about Caine. He\u2019s an aggravating bastard.\u201d Jerry pulled the knife from the sheath under his arm and set it on the counter. \u201cThere. Satisfied?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood job, Will. I like to see Blade without his toys.\u201d Ray strolled into the kitchen in jeans and a black T-shirt. He was barefoot of course. He stopped next to me and slung his arm over my shoulders. \u201cGlory here saved Sienna last night. I hope you\u2019re not going to cause a dustup over that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m glad she could help.\u201d Jerry shook his head. \u201cToo bad you can\u2019t control your urges though, Caine. What\u2019s the woman going to say when she wakes up vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you guys talking about?\u201d Sienna wandered into the kitchen dressed in one of Ray\u2019s black silk shirts and nothing else. She rubbed her eyes. \u201cRay? You let me sleep all day again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sorry about that, babe.\u201d Ray shot Jerry a look that said shut up, then took her hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s to eat? I\u2019m hungry. Any of that pizza left?\u201d She headed for the fridge and pulled open the door. \u201cYeah. I just love cold pizza for breakfast. Anyone else?\u201d She pulled out the box and set it on the counter then looked around.</p><p>The four of us just stared at her then each other. I knew this was on me.</p><p>\u201cSienna, I don\u2019t think you really want pizza.\u201d I pulled a fresh bottle of synthetic out of the fridge and twisted off the cap. Hot or cold? I dumped it into a mug and Will grabbed it, setting it into the microwave.</p><p>\u201cSure I do. Look, it\u2019s pepperoni and mushroom, my favorite.\u201d She flipped open the top and pulled out a slice.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t put that in your mouth.\u201d I grabbed it before she could take a bite. \u201cI guarantee it will make you sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t yesterday. It was delicious.\u201d She frowned at me.</p><p>\u201cTonight it will.\u201d The microwave beeped and Will handed me the mug. \u201cHere, try this. You\u2019ll be surprised how good this tastes. It\u2019s just what you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the shit Ray drinks all the time, I want no part of it. I\u2019ve tasted it when he was in the shower. It\u2019s gross.\u201d She made a face and wouldn\u2019t touch the mug.</p><p>\u201cTrust me. You will have a whole new appreciation for it now.\u201d I took her hand and wrapped it around the mug. \u201cOne sip. That\u2019s all I\u2019m asking you to take.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you all staring at me?\u201d Sienna looked around the room. \u201cOkay, I know I\u2019ve got great legs.\u201d She glanced down. \u201cAnd maybe I should have buttoned a few more buttons, but I\u2019m getting a different vibe than male appreciation here.\u201d She sniffed the mug. \u201cIt does smell pretty good.\u201d She took a cautious sip. \u201cWow. It does taste good. This must be a different brand or something.\u201d She took a deep swallow. \u201cI could get used to this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so.\u201d Ray slipped his arm around her waist. \u201cBecause you\u2019ll have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, Ray?\u201d Sienna leaned against him. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m feeling a little funny. Wobbly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s natural. It\u2019ll take a while to adjust to this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdjust to what?\u201d She sipped some more. \u201cI\u2019d like some coffee too. Will? Did you make some?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no need now. I only made it for you, Sienna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m still here.\u201d She smiled at him. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, he doesn\u2019t need to make you coffee anymore. You\u2019re on the wagon now.\u201d Ray kissed her cheek. \u201cSomething happened last night. You don\u2019t remember because I did something to make you forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell, Ray?\u201d She jerked away from him. \u201cI told you from the get-go that I\u2019m over drugs. I went through rehab and I\u2019m not going there again. It was hell. I thought you understood. We have that in common. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t drugs.\u201d Ray sighed and looked at me.</p><p>\u201cSienna, maybe you should sit down.\u201d She looked pale, not surprising, considering. And I knew my news was going to knock her off her feet.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Glory? If Ray didn\u2019t drug me, why can\u2019t I remember something from last night? And why are you all here staring at me?\u201d Sienna\u2019s voice was rising and her mug was shaking. \u201cDamn it, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re vampires, Sienna.\u201d I glanced around the room and we all were suddenly showing her our fangs.</p><p>\u201cOh, God!\u201d She dropped her mug and ran out of the room. \u201cGet away from me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand, baby.\u201d Ray ran after her. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to drink from you. Not anymore.\u201d He caught her in the hall. \u201cCome back. Let Glory tell you what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore?\u201d Sienna hit Ray on his chest as he carried her into the kitchen and thrust her onto a bar stool. \u201cWhat the hell? Did you drink my blood? Ray? Is that why you slept with me? So you could drink my blood?\u201d She slapped his face, tears running down her cheeks. \u201cHow long has this been going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, please. Listen to me. I never meant\u2014\u201d Ray didn\u2019t defend himself, just let her keep hitting and slapping him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I was an asshole.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe sure was,\u201d Jerry muttered.</p><p>I gave him a quelling look. Not helping.</p><p>\u201cSienna, what Ray did was wrong. And it had consequences.\u201d Consequences I knew she\u2019d hate. I struggled for the right words. \u201cWe can\u2019t turn back the clock. If we could, he never would have used you like that. I\u2019m sure.\u201d I stared at him, his cue to apologize again.</p> <p>\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d Ray shook his head. \u201cI lost control. Stupid of me. But you were so fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Sienna lunged for one of Jerry\u2019s knives on the counter and stabbed Ray in the arm. \u201cVampire? I can\u2019t freaking believe it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d Ray backed away while Will, bodyguard that he was, wrestled the knife from Sienna and tossed it to Jerry. Jer, of course, instantly made sure his other two knives were back where they belonged, on his body.</p><p>I handed Ray a kitchen towel to press against what was essentially a minor wound and grabbed Sienna\u2019s hands while Will kept her pinned to the bar stool.</p><p>\u201cCalm down, Sienna. I know you are upset.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUpset? Are you fucking kidding me?\u201d She stared at me, her eyes wild. \u201cI saw your fangs, Glory. All of you have fangs. This is a nightmare. What the hell is this? A coven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we don\u2019t have those. We\u2019re just, um, friends.\u201d I glanced at Jerry\u2019s scowling face. \u201cSome of us anyway. I\u2019ll mentor you, help you figure this out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell does that mean? You going to tell me why I can\u2019t eat pizza?\u201d Sienna tried to jerk her hands away and I let her go. Will glanced at me and I nodded. She jumped to her feet, swaying for a moment before grabbing the counter.</p><p>\u201cTell me the truth, Glory. What happened last night? Why did you make me drink that red stuff? Is it blood?\u201d She grabbed her mouth. \u201cOh, holy fuck, I have fangs!\u201d</p><p>Three</p><p>\u201cExplain. How did this happen?\u201d Sienna collapsed on the long leather sofa in Ray\u2019s living room. I\u2019d managed to get her there during her freak-out. I figured the kitchen wasn\u2019t exactly the best place for this. Too many sharp objects.</p> <p>Ray sat beside her and started to pick up her hand. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet away from me!\u201d She shoved him, hard. \u201cYou think I haven\u2019t figured out this is all on you?\u201d She hit him again and again. \u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t try to defend himself, just took it. \u201cI deserve whatever you want to dish out. Stab me again. Blade, give her one of your knives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jerry leaned against the cold fireplace. He was just observing. Not exactly enjoying the show, none of us were. Seeing a mortal come to terms with our world wasn\u2019t exactly a treat. It made me want to cry for all she\u2019d have to face. The losses . . .</p><p>\u201cSienna, it was an accident.\u201d I managed to speak calmly, trying to keep things from going off the rails even more. \u201cRay made a mistake. He\u2019ll take care of you now. He owes you that. Definitely. But I\u2019m the one who made you vampire.\u201d I sat across from her, in one of the big overstuffed chairs Ray favored, and leaned forward. It would help if she\u2019d quit using Ray as a punching bag. \u201cLook at me and listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d She finally sagged back, her hands falling into her lap. \u201cWhy? This is nuts. Hell.\u201d Tears glittered on her eyelashes. Fakes. I\u2019d bet my last dollar on it. I wish I could afford such a gorgeous set.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I wouldn\u2019t have done it if there had been any other way to save you. You almost died, Sienna. Ray had just about drained all the blood out of you before he called me.\u201d I had plenty of time to analyze Sienna\u2019s makeup while she sobbed into her clenched fists. It was a good distraction from my churning stomach, a cross between guilt and pride. Hey, I had saved her. So I admired her tattooed eyeliner and eyebrows with those piercings she was famous for. Flawless skin even without any other makeup. Me? I didn\u2019t fare well with the fresh-scrubbed look, especially with three hot men staring at me along with Sienna.</p><p>Okay, the waterworks were now occasional sniffles and I had to get down to business. Sienna finally looked up at me, her eyes glittering like her trademark sapphire on the side of her nose.</p> <p>\u201cYou were a heartbeat away from meeting your maker. Turning you was the only way to save your life. Ray called me because he knew I could do it.\u201d I got up and sent Ray a mental message to move. He jumped up and got out of the way and I took his place at her side. \u201cI used my blood to bring you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrained me? Wait a minute. Ray? What the fuck?\u201d She shot Ray a narrow-eyed look.</p><p>\u201cRay got carried away and drank too much of your blood.\u201d I grabbed her when she lunged for him again. \u201cYes, he\u2019s a jerk. A selfish asshole. We all agree on that.\u201d I glanced around the room and everyone nodded, even Ray. \u201cIf it makes you feel any better, he\u2019ll have to go in front of a vampire council and defend himself. They don\u2019t like us making new vampires. It\u2019s against the rules here to drain mortals like he did. He was careless and he could be killed because of his mistake with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKilled?\u201d That took some of the steam out of her. \u201cThat\u2019s a little harsh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn eye for an eye, Sienna. You\u2019re not alive now. You\u2019re what some people call undead.\u201d I patted her knee. \u201cYour life is over as you knew it. Everything is changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s crazy. I don\u2019t feel all that different. What do you mean?\u201d She looked around. \u201cExplain. Pizza. I can\u2019t eat it?\u201d She glanced back toward the kitchen. \u201cOr drink coffee?\u201d</p><p>This had been the hardest part for me. Giving up mortal food and drink. Depending on her priorities, it could be for Sienna too. I knew Ray hadn\u2019t missed food. He\u2019d mourned the sunshine and booze more.</p><p>I tried for a sympathetic smile. \u201cBlood will be your only menu option now. That was a synthetic blood you drank earlier.\u201d</p><p>She was on her feet before I could stop her. \u201cBut Ray, he wasn\u2019t satisfied with a fake, was he? He just had to have the real deal. Right from the source. Me.\u201d She poked him in his healing stab wound and he winced. \u201cIs that right, lover boy? Was your seduction, the invitation to come here and make another record, all of that just an excuse to get to my blood?\u201d She was shouting now, and her pokes had turned into shoves until Ray was pinned against the wall. \u201cWhat the hell, Ray?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, I\u2019m sorry, babe. But you\u2019ve got to know you mean more to me than just a blood donor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I? Really? When every word out of your mouth is a lie? Your sleep schedule. Your energy drink.\u201d She sobbed, bit on her fist then screamed when her fangs must have pierced it.</p><p>\u201cWe do make good music together, Sin, don\u2019t we? The label loves us.\u201d Ray tried out a smile. He knew better than to reach for her, holding his hands out to his sides in a mock surrender.</p><p>\u201cBastard! User! Yeah, I helped you win a Grammy after you hit a dry spell.\u201d She wiped tears off her cheeks. \u201cWhat I want to know is how the hell you did it. Drank my blood and I didn\u2019t have a clue you were doing it.\u201d She whirled and we all got a flash of her bare butt. She really needed to go put on some clothes. \u201cGlory, how could he do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI call it the whammy. He mesmerized you, Sienna. Stared into your eyes and made you go into a kind of trance. He could erase your memory of the things he did to you. Or you two did together. Even put you to sleep.\u201d I took her arm, easing her away from Ray. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you and I go to the bedroom and you can shower, get dressed and I\u2019ll answer all your questions? We don\u2019t need to do this in front of an audience. Especially not with Ray watching. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding.\u201d She strode toward the hallway. \u201cI don\u2019t care if I ever see that jerk-off again.\u201d She stopped and turned around to glare at him one more time. \u201cYou could make me forget things we did together?\u201d Her voice rose. \u201cWhat else, Ray? What other perverted shit did you do to me besides take my blood while I was in la-la land?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, Sin, I swear it. Please believe me. Just your blood. I didn\u2019t need . . .\u201d He glanced at the two other men. \u201cYou know, we had fun. I wouldn\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust shut the fuck up.\u201d Sienna turned on her heel and kept going toward the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t believe I\u2019d have said that, Caine,\u201d I heard Jerry say as I headed down the hall. I couldn\u2019t have agreed more. Dumbass.</p><p>I heard the shower start and decided to leave her alone to clean up and clear away at least the smell of her last night with Ray with soap and shampoo. Her stash of makeup sat on the dressing table next to the walk-in closet and I helped myself after I shut the bedroom door. Putting on my face did a lot for my own attitude, that and using a hairbrush.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s better, darling.\u201d My mother appeared next to me as I brushed on some pink blush.</p><p>The brush landed on my nose and I reached for a tissue to wipe off the streak. \u201cSeriously, Mother? Here? Now? Can\u2019t you see I have my hands full?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. And I have a feeling you\u2019re going to offer to take her home with you. Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s already a little crowded in your tiny apartment?\u201d My mother, a goddess from Olympus no less, strolled around the room, kicking aside Ray\u2019s discarded boxers with a knowing look. \u201cThat was quite a show you put on last night, saving the girl. Not surprising that you\u2019d run to the rescue. You have the urge to play hero. You inherited that from me.\u201d She settled on the foot of the bed and crossed her legs.</p><p>Tonight she wore an expensive dress that matched her blue eyes, eyes the same color as mine. Of course her dress was about four sizes smaller than anything I\u2019d ever fit into. It didn\u2019t help that I wore the dress I\u2019d had on the night before that still seemed to have a stench of evil on it. As usual Mother made me feel dowdy and in need of a makeover.</p><p>\u201cYou play hero? I\u2019ve never seen evidence of that. You want a chance to be my hero? Get rid of Aggie for me. She\u2019s the reason my apartment is too crowded. Are you getting your jollies spying on me? Watching me lose my mind with that woman in my extra bedroom?\u201d I can\u2019t tell you how much I hated the fact that my mother did spy, eavesdrop and in general insert herself into my life whenever she felt like it. But come when called, actually help me? I wished. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSpying is such an ugly word.\u201d She admired her designer shoes and I paused in my tirade to do the same. The woman had exquisite and expensive taste. \u201cI came by to compliment you and offer to help you out. We could make a run up to Olympus right now, meet your grandfather and perhaps solve the Aggie problem for you.\u201d She smiled sweetly.</p><p>\u201cGive it up, Mother. I\u2019ve told you before. I\u2019m not going up there. You\u2019ll figure out some way to trap me and I\u2019d never see the human plane again.\u201d I sighed and sat at the dressing table. \u201cCome on. I\u2019m sure you could get hold of that Siren treasure if you really tried.\u201d You think I was being mean to my mother? We\u2019d only met recently. Blame it on the fact that she\u2019d hidden me away in a Siren harem for a thousand years or so under the power of the Storm God. When I\u2019d showed a lack of killer instinct, that creep had cast me out into the mortal world to die, wiping my memory of the whole deal. Where had Mom been then? Oh, she\u2019d forgotten she had a daughter.</p><p>Jerry had saved me, turning me vampire and giving me immortality. Now Mother was suddenly back in my life, a few hundred years too late, wanting a \u201crelationship.\u201d I wasn\u2019t so keen on the idea. She hated vampires, wanted me to dump Jerry and relocate permanently to Olympus. Need I say more?</p> <p>\u201cGloriana, I\u2019ve explained this. If you want to get rid of your roommate, I know she has a debt to pay. To get the Siren treasure for her, you\u2019ll have to go to your grandfather personally and ask for it.\u201d Mother frowned down at her nails and stood. \u201cI need a manicure. Let me know when you\u2019re ready to be reasonable. Take this new vampire home with you. Try living with two difficult women for a while. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be calling for me soon, eager to go to Olympus.\u201d She patted my cheek. \u201cYour grandfather will adore you.\u201d Then she vanished.</p><p>I rolled my eyes. Grandfather. Yeah right. When Granddad was the head honcho of Olympus, you didn\u2019t just drop by for a visit, ask for treasure and then return to your normal life. Who was she kidding?</p><p>\u201cWho was that? And did she just disappear, like a magic trick?\u201d Sienna swayed in the bathroom doorway. She had a towel around her body and a towel turban on her head.</p><p>\u201cHere, sit before you fall down. Yes, she disappeared. Welcome to the paranormal world. That was my mother.\u201d I did my best to explain what she was.</p><p>\u201cAnd your grandfather?\u201d Sienna stared at me, obviously seeing the resemblance now that she knew our relationship. My mother and I did look something alike, though I was a blow-up version.</p> <p>\u201cZeus. Can you believe it?\u201d I didn\u2019t need to see her stunned expression to know she wasn\u2019t buying it. \u201cNeither can I, but I\u2019ve felt the lightning bolts from up there as proof that Olympus is real, Sienna. I\u2019ve got some strange powers too. Cool powers. I\u2019ll give you a demo sometime. Mom and I have basically just met. Long story.\u201d I knew information overload was a danger in a new vampire. \u201cGet dressed and then ask any questions you have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I have plenty.\u201d She got up and wandered into the closet, a glazed look in her eyes. In a few moments she came out in a pair of jeans and a T-shirt. She walked over to the dressing table, picked up a brush, looked into the mirror and burst into tears. \u201cWhere the hell am I?\u201d</p><p>I put my arm around her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should have warned you. Mirrors don\u2019t work for us. Here, let me.\u201d I gently took the brush from her and ran it through her short hair, slicking it behind her ears. \u201cYou\u2019ll figure this out. You can use a computer video cam as a mirror. We do show up in pictures. I have a nice setup at my apartment.\u201d I tossed down the brush. \u201cI handle my hair and makeup just by feel. But then I\u2019m pretty ancient. They didn\u2019t have computers or even cameras when I was turned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old are you?\u201d She leaned back to stare at me.</p><p>\u201cA little over four hundred, give or take a decade.\u201d I tried not to smile when she gasped. I left off the thousand years as a Siren. She was already shocked enough. \u201cDon\u2019t look it, do I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is surreal.\u201d She shoved away from me then collapsed on the bed.</p> <p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d I sat beside her. \u201cAre you dizzy? Weak?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTired. Confused. Overwhelmed. But strong.\u201d She lifted her hands and flexed her fingers. \u201cDoes this vampire thing make you strong, Glory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it does. We\u2019ll test it later.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to start breaking things yet, though trashing Ray\u2019s bedroom would probably make Sienna feel better.</p><p>\u201cYou look early twenties. Will I always look this age, right now?\u201d She pushed herself into a sitting position. \u201cAm I, uh, immortal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes and yes. That\u2019s pretty good news, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I smiled as she processed that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say. Periods?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGone. Sorry but you\u2019ll never have children now.\u201d I held my breath. Was I crushing a dream?</p><p>\u201cOh, well, I\u2019d already decided I wasn\u2019t cut out for that trip anyway. So I won\u2019t have to worry about birth control. Cool.\u201d She plumped up a pillow and leaned back on it. \u201cWhat about disease, illness? Can I catch anything?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty rare. There are a few vampire doctors but they are mostly engaged in research, working on drugs to help vamps see daylight, eat solid food, stuff like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaylight?\u201d She glanced at the French doors which had automatic shades that closed at sunrise. They were open now and we could see the terrace with its steps down to the lake and Ray\u2019s boat dock. The moon was shrouded in clouds so it was dark except for deck lights.</p><p>\u201cWe sleep all day, wake up at sunset.\u201d</p><p>Surprisingly, Sienna took that news without much reaction. Then she jumped up and faced me. \u201cWhy did Ray call you, Glory? You two still have something going?\u201d</p><p>Was Sienna jealous? Hard to believe. \u201cNo, Jerry is my boyfriend. I\u2019m Ray\u2019s mentor. I helped him right after he was turned. So naturally he called me for advice when he saw he was in trouble. You would have died otherwise. He did the right thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive me if I\u2019m not grateful to the bastard.\u201d She paced around the bed, finally jerking the sheets off and tossing them out the sliding glass doors onto the deck. \u201cI\u2019m so mad I could kill him. Vampire! Can I go back? Be normal again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. This is it.\u201d I put a hand on her shoulder but she shrugged it away. She grabbed a crystal vase and threw it at the mirror over the dressing table.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t be needing that, will we?\u201d Her laugh gave me chills.</p><p>\u201cCalm down, Sienna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Why the hell should I? I\u2019m vampire. And you are going to tell me what I can and can\u2019t do. Thanks a heap, Glory.\u201d She stomped out to the deck and took a breath. \u201cShit. I don\u2019t think I can even breathe the same. Though I can smell everything, even the bird shit on that rock over there.\u201d She pointed to a spot yards away.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to. Breathe. But your enhanced senses are cool. Enjoy them.\u201d I stayed a few feet away from her. I saw the men standing around in the living room and knew they could hear us from here through the open terrace doors.</p><p>\u201cNot breathe? That\u2019s just plain creepy.\u201d She faced me, her eyes full of tears. \u201cYou meant it. Undead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you keep it a secret? This vampire thing.\u201d Sienna reached for me, squeezing my arm. \u201cI had no idea and I was, um, surrounded by you guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not easy. We use the whammy. If a mortal sees something he or she shouldn\u2019t, we make them forget it. Like Ray did with you.\u201d I hated to remind her. Of course that had her looking back at the living room. At Ray. The tears were gone, her mouth a hard line. I kept talking.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll teach you how to do that. You\u2019ll have to deal with mortals constantly if you continue your singing career. You\u2019ll have to be careful, Sienna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you mean, if I continue my career?\u201d Now she glared at me, her eyes blazing. \u201cI\u2019m on top, my records are hitting the charts and I\u2019m about to go on tour. I\u2019ve got\u2014\u201d I could see when her new reality hit her. \u201cOh, God. Radio interviews, talk shows. Can I stay awake but inside out of the sun?\u201d Her squeeze became a painful clutch.</p><p>\u201cNo. When sunrise hits, you\u2019re dead, out like a light. You can\u2019t function at all.\u201d I covered her hand with mine. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sienna. But Ray has managed to keep his career going. Much as you hate to deal with him, he can give you good advice. Or his manager can. Nathan knows about us and our world. Ray clued him in as soon as he was turned.\u201d</p><p>Before I knew what she was going to do, she ran inside and landed on top of Ray, taking him down to the floor. Her new fangs tore into his neck and she sank them into his jugular.</p><p>\u201cGuess she figured out how to feed on her own.\u201d Jerry just stood there, watching.</p><p>\u201cThink I should pull her off?\u201d Will, as bodyguard, had a duty, but Ray waved him off.</p><p>\u201cIf she takes too much, we\u2019ll have to do something.\u201d I stopped in the doorway. Sienna was crying and drinking, making an ugly mess of Ray\u2019s throat. Her bloodlust had kicked in and her anger had taken her straight to Ray to satisfy it. He had his head back, eyes closed while he stroked her back. I was silently counting, making sure this didn\u2019t go on too long.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Will, pull her off now. Killing Ray might make her feel better but I\u2019m not letting it happen.\u201d I knelt down and touched Sienna\u2019s cheek. \u201cLet go, Sienna, you\u2019ve had enough.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and held on. I could see the ragged wounds she\u2019d torn into his neck. Luckily Ray would heal fast or there could be ugly scars.</p><p>\u201cPinch her jaw, Glory. That\u2019ll get them open. I\u2019ve got her shoulders.\u201d Will knelt on her other side.</p><p>Strong pressure and her fangs popped loose. Then we heaved her up and off.</p><p>\u201cSelfish bastard. You ruined my life. My career.\u201d She kicked at Ray, connecting with his ribs. \u201cWe wrote that love song together. Did that mean anything to you?\u201d Tears ran down her cheeks to mix with the blood that smeared around her mouth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s all I can say. Your career will be fine. I\u2019ll help you.\u201d Ray propped himself up on one elbow with a wince.</p><p>\u201cDamn right you will. Vampire!\u201d She struggled against Will\u2019s arm around her waist. \u201cI hope that council ties you to a tree and lets the sun fry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ve heard enough. Let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d I glanced at Jerry. \u201cSienna, do you have a car?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, let\u2019s go. My rental\u2019s out front. I can\u2019t wait to get away from this asshole.\u201d She gave Ray one more kick then rushed back to the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you taking her?\u201d Ray struggled to his feet with Will\u2019s help.</p><p>\u201cWhere else? Home with me. Someone has to keep an eye on her and it\u2019s not going to be you.\u201d I saw that the wound on his neck had already stopped bleeding. \u201cJerry, why don\u2019t you meet us out front? Will, can you show him which car is Sienna\u2019s rental? We\u2019ll be out in a minute. Ray, do us both a favor and disappear now.\u201d I glanced back down the hall.</p><p>\u201cCall Damian and order whatever synthetic you need for her. Tell him to put it on my tab.\u201d Ray sighed and started toward the kitchen. \u201cTell her I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not ready to hear that.\u201d I knew Sienna would be out any moment. \u201cRemember how you felt when this was done to you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, too well. I took away her future.\u201d He ran his hand over his eyes. \u201cDamn it, if the council decides to end me, they\u2019ll be doing me a favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRay.\u201d Sienna stood in the doorway. \u201cI really don\u2019t want to watch your pity party right now.\u201d She stomped over to face him. \u201cYou can\u2019t fix this so now I expect you to make amends. We both know that\u2019s part of a twelve-step program. You\u2019ll be doing some big-time making up to me. Understand?\u201d She pressed a black-painted fingernail to his chest, drawing blood.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Sure. If that\u2019s what you want.\u201d He straightened his shoulders, smart enough not to grab her hand.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s what you owe me. First, from what Glory is telling me, I may need a new manager. Seems like Nathan is the only one who knows the vampire scene. Talk to him, persuade him to take me on because obviously I\u2019m going to have to let mine go.\u201d She took a shaky breath, tears glittering on those long and beautiful fake lashes. \u201cDamn, I hate this. But I can\u2019t put Ethan through this. Canceling shit for what he\u2019ll think are arbitrary reasons. And he\u2019d never get this vampire thing.\u201d She covered her eyes for a minute. \u201cI don\u2019t get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBabe . . .\u201d Ray obviously couldn\u2019t stand it and tried to take her hand. Sienna sprang back, startling herself when she landed across the room, near me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your babe.\u201d She looked down. \u201cHow far did I just jump?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbout eight feet.\u201d I settled my hand on her shoulder. \u201cA new manager. That\u2019s a good idea. Make Nate go along with it, Ray. Get busy. Make some calls. If you\u2019re already helping Sienna, the council will be impressed. I hope.\u201d I could feel Sienna shaking, her surprise at her new physical prowess obviously more upsetting than she let on. \u201cReady to go, Sienna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I have three bags in the closet. Will, can you get them?\u201d She picked up her tote. \u201cLet\u2019s jet.\u201d She stepped aside when Ray reached for her. \u201cTouch me and die, Ray. I will never forgive you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d He moved when Will appeared with Sienna\u2019s bags and followed us outside. The car was a small convertible. By the time we got Sienna\u2019s stuff crammed inside, Jerry had decided to fly to the apartment and meet us there.</p><p>\u201cWhat? He can fly?\u201d Sienna had overheard our discussion.</p><p>\u201cNot in my human form like Superman. I shape-shift. We\u2019ll teach you how.\u201d Jerry kept his arm around me. \u201cGloriana had a hard time with it at first but it\u2019s really a simple process.\u201d He kissed me on the cheek. \u201cWatch.\u201d He transformed into a blackbird and took off.</p><p>\u201cOh. My. God.\u201d Sienna leaned against the car. \u201cThis is getting weirder and weirder. What else can you guys do? Can you turn into other stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Will did the bat thing then easily became a dog before turning back into his human form.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m going to be sick.\u201d Sienna rushed over to the bushes and we heard her retch.</p> <p>\u201cGuess I should have saved some of that for another time.\u201d Will grinned and strolled over to pat her on the back and offer her a handkerchief.</p><p>\u201cDamned show-off.\u201d Ray had stayed near his front door.</p><p>\u201cYou got it, flaunt it. Sienna, you\u2019ll have fun with that once you try it. Don\u2019t be a wuss like I was.\u201d I helped her climb into the car, taking her keys and settling into the driver\u2019s seat myself. She was pale and shaky, our reality still too much for her. I could see that she couldn\u2019t imagine \u201cfun\u201d and \u201cvampire\u201d ever going together. \u201cAre you okay enough for me to start the car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. I asked Will for water and he said I couldn\u2019t even drink that.\u201d Sienna\u2019s eyes filled. \u201cThis is too much. Maybe the fresh air will clear my head. Just drive, Glory.\u201d She leaned back against the seat and closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou could have rinsed out your mouth.\u201d I glared at Will. It wouldn\u2019t have killed him to fetch her a bottle of water. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sienna. The first few days are the roughest. Take some breaths and try to relax.\u201d I started the car and took off. It had been so long since I\u2019d been turned I couldn\u2019t remember that early adjustment period. But Sienna had a lot more to lose than I\u2019d had back in 1604. I\u2019d been an actress of sorts and no one had missed me when I\u2019d stayed with Jerry instead of returning to the theater. Sienna was going to have to do plenty to make her career stay on track despite her new lifestyle.</p><p>Her display of bloodlust had reminded me that she\u2019d have a raging thirst these first few days. But I\u2019d have to make sure there were no more uncontrolled feedings. As soon as we got to my place, I\u2019d have to give her a lesson in drinking from a vein. Fun and games. Because you know whose vein it would have to be.</p><p>When we arrived in the alley behind my apartment and the shop, the lights were working and Jerry leaned against my car. No sign of you know who. Of course not. She\u2019d never let Jerry see her threaten me. Probably played innocent around him, though it wouldn\u2019t help her cause. Jerry grabbed Sienna\u2019s bags while I helped her out of the car. She was fading fast and sniffing the air. I knew I was going to have to feed her as soon as we got upstairs.</p><p>At the door to the apartment, we could all hear the TV blaring. Obviously Aggie was home and watching one of her favorite shows. She\u2019d given up Judge Judy after losing an important court case in her own life. Now she was hooked on other reality shows. If there was a Real Housewives on the air, she was there watching. I unlocked the door and saw she was riveted by a hair-pulling fight next to a pool. Looked like either Miami or Los Angeles. Seriously? These \u201chousewives\u201d in bikinis with spray tans had had enough plastic surgeries between them to finance a clinic.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d Aggie set a bag of rice cakes on the coffee table. She was supposedly on a serious diet these days though a Snickers wrapper peeked from under the couch cushion. \u201cSuitcases? Is she planning to stay here? Where is she going to sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSienna Star meet Aggie . . . Did you decide on a last name?\u201d I helped Sienna into a chair.</p><p>\u201cNot yet. Maybe I\u2019ll be like Cher. One name\u2019s enough.\u201d She glared when I snorted. \u201cHey, Star. Rock star Sienna Star. Didn\u2019t you do a guest appearance on Real Housewives of Malibu?\u201d Aggie was interested now.</p><p>\u201cA lifetime ago.\u201d Sienna collapsed in a chair.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? You look pale. Glory? What\u2019s up? Is she a vampire?\u201d Aggie glared when I nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s get something straight right now, lady. Famous chick or not, I\u2019m off the menu. Glory, you tell her.\u201d Aggie grabbed her rice cakes and a diet soda and clicked off the TV. \u201cI\u2019m going to bed. The DVR is set so I can watch this when I get home from work tomorrow. Maybe you should get a pullout couch, Glory, if you\u2019re going to bring home strays. Speaking of. I fed your cat.\u201d She made a face, then headed down the hall. We could hear her muttering about bloodsuckers.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Aggie.\u201d I looked for Boogie, but he was probably hiding. He did that when we had company. I\u2019d inherited him when a fledgling I\u2019d mentored had moved to California to enter med school.</p><p>\u201cWhat a bitch.\u201d Sienna sighed as she leaned back. \u201cWhat did I do to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. She\u2019s always like that these days. She tried to sue an ex-lover and lost. Now she has to clean his house every day as part of a settlement. Wouldn\u2019t that put a kink in your tail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019ll try to cut her some slack. She did smell pretty good though.\u201d Sienna covered her mouth with one hand. \u201cThese fangs are going to be a problem if they just pop out whenever I\u2019m around a, whatcha call \u2019em, mortal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive it time. You\u2019ll gain more control.\u201d I sat on the couch, smiling when Jerry settled next to me. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working on a way to get her out of here, but so far no luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much does she owe?\u201d Sienna\u2019s head wobbled. \u201cNo, don\u2019t tell me. I\u2019m not paying off anyone\u2019s debts. I have no idea how I\u2019m going to be able to work with this new life I\u2019ve got, so money may be tight for me too.\u201d She sighed and let her head drop until it rested on the back of the chair. \u201cGlory, I don\u2019t feel so hot. I need to lie down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Here, stretch out on the couch.\u201d I jumped up and grabbed one of her arms, Jerry the other. Soon we had her stretched out on the couch. \u201cYou need blood and this time I\u2019m going to show you how to drink properly. You need some ancient vampire blood. What you got from Ray held you for a while, but he\u2019s a fairly new vampire. My blood is a lot stronger. It will give you strength.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, Gloriana. You turned her last night and are still fairly weak. Go get a bottle of synthetic for yourself. I\u2019ll feed her.\u201d Jerry sat beside her on the couch. \u201cNow here\u2019s what you do, Sienna. You remember me, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, though you seem to have a couple of names. Is it Jerry or Jeremiah or Blade?\u201d She stared up at him, her face paper white.</p><p>\u201cI go by Jeremy Blade this century. We change our names if we think we\u2019ve used the same one too long. When you live for hundreds of years, it\u2019s sometimes necessary.\u201d He glanced at me where I stood in the kitchen doorway. \u201cNow I want you to take my hand and pull my wrist to your mouth. Smell it and see what happens.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSmell?\u201d She tentatively took his hand. \u201cThis is weird. My senses are totally out of whack. Like I\u2019m hyped up on something. Just like Glory told me they would be.\u201d She glanced around. \u201cIs there chocolate here somewhere?\u201d</p><p>I walked over and pulled out that Snickers wrapper. It left a smear on my upholstery. Damn Aggie. One name? She\u2019d be lucky to have that when I got through with her.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s what you smelled. But concentrate. Lean in, toward Jerry\u2019s wrist. Smell something else?\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and pulled his arm toward her. \u201cOh, geez, my teeth are shifting again. Your blood!\u201d Her eyes popped open. \u201cI smell it, Jerry. And it\u2019s, um, delicious. Better than the chocolate. Though I never would have thought . . .\u201d She wrinkled her nose. \u201cWow. I can actually hear your pulse too. It\u2019s like a drumbeat. Bu-bump, bu-bump, bu-bump. Singing \u2018Drink me,\u2019 clear as can be.\u201d She grinned and there were her fangs. She ran her tongue over them. \u201cDamn, my teeth are sharp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so you can bite into my vein there, in my wrist. Go ahead, pierce it carefully. We don\u2019t rip into skin like you did Caine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGuess that was pretty harsh. But the bastard deserved it. Am I right?\u201d She looked at me for validation. I nodded.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll heal and not even scar. I\u2019m sure it hurt. But you don\u2019t want to act like an animal when you drink. For one thing, you\u2019ll lose some of the blood you\u2019re after.\u201d I leaned over the back of the sofa and pointed to the blue vein that we could all see clearly in Jerry\u2019s wrist. I had my own thirst to contend with and took a deep swallow of synthetic then pointed. \u201cThere. Position your mouth like you\u2019re going to give him a hickey, but your fangs will sink in. When his blood begins to fill your mouth, suck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, man.\u201d She frowned at me. \u201cYou won\u2019t mind? This is your boyfriend I\u2019m getting groovy with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s feeding, not sexual. At least not like this.\u201d I ran my hands through Jerry\u2019s hair. \u201cTrust me, when you are with your lover and feeding is part of it, it can be quite a turn-on. You\u2019ll have to find your own man to experience that with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it. It sure won\u2019t be Ray again. Bastard. You think drinking my blood while I was unconscious turned him on?\u201d She pulled Jerry\u2019s wrist closer and inhaled. I could see her hands shaking. \u201cProbably did, the perv.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on and drink. My blood is vintage, about five hundred years old, even older than Glory\u2019s.\u201d Jerry reached for me with his other hand. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about hurting me. I\u2019m a warrior. I can take the little pain your bite will cause me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou sure? I . . .\u201d She licked his arm. \u201cOh, sorry. That was icky of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that was right. Instinctual. You just anaesthetized the area. Our saliva does that. It\u2019ll help dull the pain. Go ahead. Bite. I want you to feel better. It pleases me to help you. Because you are Glory\u2019s child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, geez. That\u2019s bizarre. Here goes.\u201d She closed her eyes, took a deep breath, her nostrils flaring. Then she sank her fangs into Jerry\u2019s skin. He winced. Obviously this newbie had no finesse.</p><p>I slid an arm around him, my cheek against his. \u201cThanks. You\u2019re being awfully cool about this. I wonder what I could possibly do to make it up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll figure out something.\u201d He turned his head and kissed me. His mouth on mine always made me realize how right we were for each other, his taste the perfect completion that I always searched for.</p><p>I pulled back with a sigh. \u201cDon\u2019t let her take too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t. I\u2019m timing her.\u201d He rested his free hand on her hair, then gently pressed on her forehead. \u201cEnough, Sienna. That\u2019s enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d She gripped his arm with both hands, refusing to let go.</p> <p>I walked around behind her and grabbed her shoulders. Together, Jerry and I managed to wrench her free.</p><p>\u201cOh, gosh. I\u2019m sorry. I was so into that.\u201d She was flushed and wiped her mouth with the back of her hand. When she saw the blood there, she shrieked. \u201cOh, shit. What have I become? Glory, am I some kind of mindless animal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, calm down.\u201d I took Jerry\u2019s place next to her on the couch. \u201cLook. It will take time for you to learn control. But you will learn it. You\u2019ve only been a vampire for twenty-four hours. Like he said, Jerry\u2019s blood is really ancient. Premium stuff.\u201d I smiled up at him. \u201cI have a hard time pulling away from him myself.\u201d I took a cloth Jerry handed me, wiped her face and cleaned off her hand. \u201cNow relax. Do you feel better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Jazzed. Almost high.\u201d She sat up. \u201cIt\u2019s hours until daylight. We should do something. Go out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather you not be around mortals just yet.\u201d I frowned down the hall. We had a mortal pretty close. \u201cAggie is right. She\u2019s not on the menu. When you smell her blood, it will tempt you. Don\u2019t give in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I? She\u2019s not very nice.\u201d Sienna got up and walked around the room, scowling at my Israel Caine shrine. I had one of her CDs there too.</p><p>\u201cNice has nothing to do with bloodlust. You want to go out, let\u2019s head downstairs to my shop. Now you know why my store is open twenty-four hours a day. As a vampire, I wanted to be able to work all night. I hire shape-shifters to work it during the day. This time of night there won\u2019t be many people there who aren\u2019t paranormal, no one Jerry and I can\u2019t help you handle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShape-shifters? Like Will? No, he was a vampire who could change into other stuff. Jerry too. So what are those? More paranormals?\u201d Sienna grabbed her purse like she was ready to go.</p><p>\u201cYes, you have a lot of things you need to know. Gloriana, we should stay up here.\u201d Jerry frowned, clearly not happy about a field trip with a new vampire.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m too hyped to stay here. And I sure can\u2019t stay in this tiny apartment all the time.\u201d Sienna smiled at me. \u201cNo offense, Glory. Just a few minutes, Jerry? I\u2019ll behave and maybe buy something in the shop.\u201d</p><p>I knew Jerry was right, but couldn\u2019t turn down the chance for the business. The mice fiasco had to have hurt sales. Sienna had shopped in Vintage Vamp\u2019s before and spent a bundle.</p><p>\u201cOkay, just for a while, but you\u2019re going to run out of steam soon, Sienna. This burst of energy won\u2019t last.\u201d I was desperate to change clothes. \u201cI\u2019m taking a quick shower first. Jerry, will you wait?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He reached for the remote and settled on the couch. He soon found a European soccer match.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I need to fix my makeup. You never know when the paparazzi will try to snap a picture. Glory, you said you had one of those computer setups here so I can see myself. Can I use it?\u201d Sienna dropped her purse and grabbed her tote from by the door.</p><p>\u201cSure. It\u2019s in the bedroom. Follow me.\u201d I led the way, then snatched clean underwear and a robe before I headed for the bathroom. \u201cYou can figure it out. It\u2019s there on my dresser.\u201d</p><p>She sat on the foot of the bed. \u201cThanks for this, Glory.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. What had I gotten myself into? \u201cNo problem. Just remember that there will be temptations down there. It\u2019s important for you to use self-control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019ve been stalked by fans, paparazzi, you name it, and never killed one of them yet. I think I can handle myself around, what do you call them?\u201d She grinned. \u201cMortals.\u201d She rummaged in her tote.</p><p>\u201cShe has the confidence of the innocent.\u201d Jerry stood in the doorway and pulled me close.</p><p>\u201cYes. Be prepared to use the whammy down there. I figure she\u2019ll get close to a mortal and show her fangs. I just hope no one gets a picture of it.\u201d I pulled him back into the living room, where the noise of the game would drown out our conversation.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a public figure. This is going to be about as bad as it was with Israel Caine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least she isn\u2019t an alcoholic.\u201d I ran my hand up his chest. \u201cBut, Jer, when are we ever going to be alone again?\u201d I\u2019d just pulled his head down to kiss him when we heard shrieks coming from my bedroom. What now?</p><p>Four</p><p>We ran into my bedroom to find Sienna with my comforter draped over her head, swatting frantically at . . . bees?</p><p>\u201cGet them off of me!\u201d She flailed her arms, a quilted butterfly on steroids. \u201cI\u2019m highly allergic. Look in my purse for my EpiPen.\u201d She sobbed and threw herself facedown on the bed, covered from head to toe.</p><p>Jerry ran to my window and jerked up the blackout shade then the window itself. \u201cWhere the hell could these have come from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a pretty good idea.\u201d I swatted at the bees\u2014there had to be dozens\u2014using a hardback book from my dresser. I\u2019m always interested in self-help. This one focused on inner peace. I wish. Right now I\u2019d take peace anywhere I could find it.</p><p>Jerry grabbed my hair spray and attacked them with that. It seemed to do the trick and most of them flew toward the fresh air coming in from the open window. With my fanning and Jerry\u2019s spraying, we soon had all but a few out of there. He smacked one with his bare hand when it landed on my arm.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that.\u201d He brushed it off. \u201cCheck on Sienna, I\u2019ll grab her purse.\u201d He strode to the living room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSienna, can you talk?\u201d I lifted the edge of the cover. She peered up at me, her face swollen and covered with stings.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, don\u2019t look at me.\u201d She jerked the quilted spread back over herself. \u201cBring me my pen before my throat closes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt may not. You\u2019re a vampire now. You\u2019re already healing. Look at the bites on your arms. Are they as bad as usual?\u201d I sat beside her. Jerry dropped her purse next to us.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not about to go purse diving. You look for it.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cHow is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe looks terrible but she\u2019s still able to talk. I think she\u2019s already on the mend. Aren\u2019t you, Sienna?\u201d</p><p>She sat up, cautiously looked around, then threw back the cover. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s a freaking miracle, but you\u2019re right. I\u2019d be dead if I were still a, um, mortal.\u201d She examined the backs of her hands which were covered with angry red dots but weren\u2019t as swollen as they\u2019d been even a minute ago. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just fed. So you\u2019re healing very fast. It helped that Jerry\u2019s blood was ancient.\u201d I leaned back against him. \u201cYour face already looks a thousand times better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God. I freaked when I opened your computer mirror thing and suddenly all those bees swarmed out.\u201d She glared at the laptop still open on my dresser. \u201cWhat the hell? Has this happened before?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d I looked back at Jerry. \u201cI think we had a visitor today, while no one was home. Sabotage and meant for me, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho would do such a thing?\u201d Sienna sighed and climbed off the bed. She grabbed my book and slammed it onto a stray bee that dared land next to the laptop. \u201cGot it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJerry has an old girlfriend who wants him back. I\u2019m pretty sure she did this. She wants me to give him up so he\u2019ll turn to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re jumping to conclusions, Gloriana.\u201d Jerry sat next to me on the bed.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me right now?\u201d I felt my jaw drop. \u201cHow else do you think we suddenly have a beehive in my laptop, Jerry? Obviously, Mel got in here and planted them while Aggie was at work and I was at Ray\u2019s.\u201d The very idea of that woman in my home during the day made me sick. No, terrified. If I\u2019d been dead to the world here when she\u2019d come in . . . All it would take is a stake to the heart.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have your key or the code to security here.\u201d Jerry clutched my hand. I could see the implications weren\u2019t lost on him either. \u201cThis building is supposed to be safe from intruders during the day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you defending her?\u201d I jumped up. \u201cAggie forgets to set the security system half the time and the woman practices voodoo. I imagine she has some kind of \u2018Open Sesame\u2019 spell to crack through any defense, any place she chooses.\u201d I jumped up. \u201cOh, my God! Boogie! Here, kitty!\u201d I fell to the floor and looked under the bed, his favorite hiding place. I managed to scoop him into my arms. \u201cHe seems to be okay.\u201d He purred against my chest. \u201cWhen I think what could have happened . . .\u201d My breath hitched.</p><p>\u201cCalm down, Gloriana.\u201d Jerry reached out and stroked the cat\u2019s head. That was Boogie\u2019s signal to leap down and race for his food bowl in the kitchen. \u201cFirst, we\u2019ll make sure Aggie never forgets again. That\u2019s intolerable. Second, I doubt Mel is that strong. A spell like that? I\u2019ve never seen her do anything more than make a few things disappear. Parlor tricks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and I both have smelled the evil around her. She\u2019s much more than a trickster. But if you saw her in Miami on business a while back, I suppose it\u2019s possible she got hold of your keys there while you were in your death sleep and had copies made. For future use.\u201d I walked over to stand next to Sienna, brushing a dead bee off the laptop.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see her. Not like you think.\u201d Jerry followed me. \u201cShe tried to start up again. I shut her down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess she didn\u2019t want to hear that. Maybe she hung around after sunrise and slipped past your security. Clearly she\u2019s obsessed with you, Jer.\u201d I couldn\u2019t look at him, still shaking from the idea that the woman had been in my bedroom during the day. \u201cBut why bees? Surely she knows vampires heal from stings in minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Mel did this, she wanted to irritate you. Make it inconvenient for you to keep seeing me. Obviously she\u2019s miscalculated. You and I both know this kind of nonsense isn\u2019t going to pull us apart.\u201d He slipped his arms around me, actually smiling. \u201cSeriously, Gloriana, I\u2019ve told Mel to leave you alone. That none of her tricks will bring me back to her. This might have been her last final desperate act.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re assuming she\u2019s rational, Jerry. And coming here during the day isn\u2019t nonsense. It\u2019s a death threat.\u201d I glanced at Sienna. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Are you all right?\u201d She was staring into the computer screen, her eyes welling.</p><p>\u201cYou said I\u2019d heal. But look at me. Everywhere one of those bees stung me, I have a blue dot. Blue! And they aren\u2019t going away.\u201d She whirled around, her eyes wild. \u201cDo you have any idea what this could mean to my career? How can I go out in public like this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRelax, Sienna. Whatever it is, death sleep usually heals everything. Tomorrow night you should be as good as new.\u201d Of course I\u2019d had some problems in the past that had managed to hang on past a good day\u2019s sleep. When I stepped closer and took her chin in my hand I could see that the bites had turned blue. And she was covered with them. There were at least ten on each cheek and a pattern resembling the Big Dipper decorated her forehead. No way could we pass this off as a fashion statement, and it would take a dump truck full of concealer to hide them. The fact that she had more blue dots on her neck, arms and chest made it worse.</p><p>\u201cThis is nuts. And you\u2019re right, Gloriana. Sneaking in here during the day was a death threat.\u201d Jerry stomped to the bedroom door. \u201cI\u2019m finding Mel and making her stop this vendetta against you once and for all. She\u2019ll fix this, Sienna, or she\u2019ll never draw another breath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Jerry.\u201d Sienna brushed tears off her cheeks. They weren\u2019t swollen now, just decorated. We winced when the front door slammed behind him. \u201cWill he really kill her? He\u2019s got to make her take care of this first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea. The woman has put a spell on him. He\u2019s told her many times he\u2019s done with her but if he gets a whiff of her blood . . . ?\u201d I sank down on the foot of the bed. \u201cI don\u2019t want to think about it, but I have a feeling he drank her blood the last time he saw her. Jer hates synthetics and has always preferred mortal donors.\u201d I saw that I had at least three blue dots on my arms too. \u201cHe won\u2019t admit it but he\u2019s a sucker, pardon the pun, for her flavor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s kind of cheating, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Sienna sagged down next to me. \u201cMaybe you should break up with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea what we\u2019ve been through together. I won\u2019t let that witch tear us apart.\u201d I got up and rummaged in my dresser drawer, coming up with a stick concealer that had always worked wonders for me. \u201cLet\u2019s see if we can make you presentable enough to go downstairs. If we hide up here, Mel has won.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want that.\u201d She grabbed the concealer and started rubbing it on. \u201cThis is pretty good stuff. I\u2019ll just have to stay away from close-ups.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cVoodoo is real too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid so. Ghosts, were-cats, even werewolves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve fallen down the rabbit hole.\u201d Sienna kept working on her spots. \u201cBut that\u2019s okay. I\u2019m cool with it. As long as these blue things go away. If I\u2019m living forever, I\u2019ll be damned if it\u2019s looking like a polka-dotted freak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, our death sleep usually finishes any healing we need to do. With luck, you\u2019ll wake up tomorrow after sunset good as new.\u201d I left Sienna to her face painting and finally got the shower I was desperate for. It made me feel marginally better but I was furious with Mel. Not happy with Jerry either. He\u2019d tried to make light of the woman\u2019s behavior. More and more it seemed he was under a spell of some kind. I needed advice. And it had to come from someone who knew the voodoo world. I remembered that Flo had gotten help for me once from a priestess in New Orleans. I had to call my best friend right away and get that expert\u2019s number.</p><p>Just explaining Mel\u2019s latest trick took a while, then Flo had to arrange to call me back after she\u2019d dug for that number. She didn\u2019t want to let Richard know what she was up to. He didn\u2019t approve of the dark arts and she\u2019d never admitted to her husband that she\u2019d consulted a voodoo priestess when they\u2019d been in the Crescent City.</p><p>I got dressed in a long-sleeved sweater and matching navy pants, then found Sienna in the kitchen staring at the bottles of synthetic blood I kept in the refrigerator.</p><p>\u201cReady to go?\u201d I grabbed a bottle of B positive and twisted off the cap.</p><p>\u201cIn a minute.\u201d Sienna slammed the fridge shut without selecting anything. I doubted if she was really thirsty after drinking from Jerry. \u201cWhy\u2019d you pick that, um, flavor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cheap, tastes pretty good, and I\u2019m in a hurry. I save the negative stuff for special occasions.\u201d I smiled at her. \u201cYou have a tasty blood type. You don\u2019t want to hear this, but Ray got carried away with you because you have blood that is like fine wine to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA negative.\u201d Sienna looked thoughtful. \u201cGood to know. But no excuse for Ray. I\u2019m going to get even with him somehow. Wait and see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you should. The man deserves some serious payback.\u201d I finished my bottle, rinsed it out and tossed it into the recycle bin. \u201cBe sure to put your empties in here. Save the planet. Ray\u2019s arranging to send over some expensive stuff. You\u2019ll like it better than what I stock.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the least he can do. You drink it too. Putting me up like this is a favor to him and me. And recycling? Sure. Guess that\u2019s important when you know you\u2019ll be around a long, long time.\u201d She smiled. \u201cI can\u2019t wrap my mind around that yet. Live forever, look twenty-five forever and I\u2019m in the best shape of my life thanks to that last stint in rehab.\u201d She gave me the once-over. It didn\u2019t take mind reading to know she felt bad for me, stuck in a less than perfect body.</p><p>\u201cYes, you\u2019re lucky. I didn\u2019t have a clue when Jerry turned me.\u201d I smacked my butt in pants that had the spandex I loved. \u201cHe stuffed me like a Christmas goose before my big V-day. I\u2019d been close to starving before then. A widow with no skills.\u201d I sighed, remembering. \u201cAfter I became vampire I found out too late that I should have fasted or something beforehand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he likes you the way you are, that\u2019s all that matters. And you know how to dress to look good.\u201d Sienna leaned against the kitchen counter.</p> <p>\u201cThanks, Sienna. I know my figure\u2019s not in style, but lots of ancient males like a little padding on their women. Lucky for me.\u201d I pulled open a drawer and found an extra set of keys. \u201cHere\u2019s the key to the door here and the one downstairs. Though now I\u2019m thinking I should get the locks changed on this door.\u201d I shared the security code to the building.</p><p>\u201cAm I safe here? I heard you say that woman sneaked in here and planted those bees during the day and that she could have killed you while you slept. It\u2019s scary to think what would have happened if Ray hadn\u2019t called you over to help with me last night.\u201d She shuddered. \u201cDoes that happen a lot? People coming after you while you\u2019re, um, dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s always a possibility. Usually we\u2019re okay with normal security and blackout shades.\u201d I put my arm around her shoulders while she slipped her feet into platform sandals. She\u2019d changed clothes, and her whole outfit, from the nude long-sleeved silk T-shirt with a logo from an Italian designer to brown leggings, screamed casual rocker with a killer body. \u201cTry not to freak out about it, Sienna. We\u2019ll figure out a way to stay safe.\u201d</p><p>She sat on my couch with a sigh. \u201cYou want to tell me the whole story? About this bitch who can do magic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. Later. Obviously I need better daylight security again until we put her out of commission. I used to have a bodyguard, a shifter who stayed with me twenty-four/seven. Jerry paid for it. I finally cut the guy loose and have been counting on the building security to do the job ever since. Guess that isn\u2019t enough right now.\u201d My knees turned to water and I grabbed the back of the couch while the reality of what had happened hit me hard. Aggie left us every day not long after daylight and was gone most of the day. That gave Mel hours to come in and . . . I had a horror movie going in my head that made me want to scream.</p> <p>\u201cGlory? You think we need a bodyguard again? What do you want to do?\u201d Sienna got up and touched my arm. \u201cI can pay the freight. I usually travel with a posse anyway. I know I griped about money, but it\u2019s really not an issue. I don\u2019t blow it like some rockers do, and I have plenty socked away. I\u2019ve always known my singing days are limited.\u201d She touched her wild hair and wrinkled her pierced nose. \u201cCan you see this when I\u2019m forty? Sixty? I\u2019m not planning to be one of those geriatric rockers who doesn\u2019t know when to call it quits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never look geriatric now, Sienna.\u201d I touched her shoulder. \u201cBut you\u2019ll have to face a different issue with your looks later. When you don\u2019t age. That\u2019s years away. Something you can figure out when the time comes. As to the guard? We could split it, I suppose. That might make it easier on both of us. And it sure would make me feel better.\u201d I tried to run calculations in my head but knew I really couldn\u2019t afford to pay for even half of top-notch security. As long as Sienna was staying here though . . .</p><p>Hey, maybe she shouldn\u2019t. If I put her in danger . . . I sat down again. Overwhelmed.</p><p>\u201cSo where do we go for this help? Obviously not my usual sources.\u201d Sienna frowned and pulled out her cell. \u201cI need a whole new contact list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know who to call. Jerry won\u2019t like it, but I know who always made me feel safe during the day.\u201d I pulled my own phone out of my purse. His number was third on my speed dial, right after Jerry and Flo. He answered on the second ring.</p><p>\u201cGlory. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing good, Rafe. Can you meet me in the shop? Soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. We\u2019re closing right now. Give me thirty minutes. Is that okay?\u201d His voice was deep and comforting. I felt better already.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Rafe. I knew I could count on you.\u201d I ended the call. \u201cLet\u2019s go on down to the shop. You can see what\u2019s new.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I love your store. I have a gig on Halloween night and a party afterward. Maybe I can pick up a costume.\u201d Sienna jumped up, purse on her arm.</p><p>\u201cSure, costumes are one of our specialties.\u201d I followed Sienna down the stairs and watched her try out the security code. She had a good memory and we were soon out on the street. Luckily there were no paparazzi around and we ducked into my shop unnoticed.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Rafe?\u201d Sienna stopped in front of a rack of costumes and fingered the fringe on a flapper dress.</p><p>\u201cMy ex-bodyguard. He and I . . . Well, we got pretty close for a while. That\u2019s why Jerry won\u2019t be too keen on the idea. You know Rafe. He\u2019s the owner of N-V, where you sang the other night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cValdez! Sure. He\u2019s hot, Glory. So you two hooked up.\u201d Sienna gave me a high five. \u201cNice work. But no wonder Jerry won\u2019t like him hanging around. Will Rafe have time for a bodyguard assignment?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. But he can always recommend someone. He\u2019s a shape-shifter and knows a network of them. Most of the people who work at N-V are paranormals.\u201d I pulled out a two-piece genie costume that would show off Sienna\u2019s perfect figure. \u201cYou\u2019d look hot in this. Make Ray wish he\u2019d behaved himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I like it. I\u2019ll try both of these on.\u201d She headed for the dressing room. \u201cI never would have guessed . . .\u201d She shut up when two more customers came into the shop. We\u2019d been alone except for my clerk Megan until then. \u201cWhat about here? Mortal or . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot. It\u2019s just good policy to hire people like us. When you\u2019re not, um, normal, it\u2019s nice to help each other out. I struggled for a lot of years, trying to find work that would allow for my crazy sleep pattern.\u201d I glanced back at Megan, who was unlocking the jewelry case for the new customers, and lowered my voice. \u201cMegan is my day manager\u2019s cousin, a were-cat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, wow. I just can\u2019t imagine.\u201d Sienna stepped into the dressing room. \u201cThis world is crazy freaky. If the tabloids only knew . . .\u201d She grinned and closed the door.</p><p>I turned away. There was something about her grin that made me uneasy. No, I was freaked because of Mel and her tricks, that was all. And worried that there could be more mice. Though I was sure Megan would have ferreted out any strays and made short work of them. I shuddered at the thought.</p><p>Sienna came out and modeled the flapper costume, not short enough. The blue dots on her arms showed and we both decided to take her business to the back room before a customer noticed. She was already getting looks, recognized. I was surprised she hadn\u2019t been approached for an autograph yet. She was getting into the genie outfit in my bathroom when Rafe showed up. I couldn\u2019t help myself. I ran into his arms.</p><p>\u201cI am so glad to see you.\u201d I let his warmth surround me with safety. It was tempting to linger. Finally I pushed back with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cOkay, now tell me what\u2019s up. You\u2019re obviously upset about something.\u201d</p><p>I dragged him to the back room, shut the door and told him the whole story. I let him know about Melisandra and her tricks, her determination to have Jerry for herself and our confrontation. When I got to the bee invasion Rafe grabbed my arms.</p><p>\u201cShe got into your apartment during the day?\u201d He said it so loudly I was afraid the customers up front could hear him through the door.</p><p>\u201cYes. That\u2019s why I called you. Do you know someone I can hire to watch over us while we sleep?\u201d I covered his hands. His concern made it clear to me that he still had some work to do before he was totally over what we\u2019d had. And me? Just being this close, looking up into those warm brown eyes so full of caring, made me remember how he always made me feel. Safe, cherished, respected.</p><p>\u201cKnow someone? As if I\u2019d trust anyone else. And who is us? Blade going to be there?\u201d He let go and stepped back.</p><p>\u201cNo. Sienna Star. Ray had an accident and she\u2019s now a vampire. I had to turn her to save her life.\u201d I saw his face harden. Okay, so he and Ray weren\u2019t buddies. And having to ask about Jerry hadn\u2019t been easy for him either.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re shittin\u2019 me. An accident? Don\u2019t excuse him, Glory. What an idiot. And now that sweet young thing is stuck as a vampire.\u201d He glanced at the door into the shop. \u201cI thought I smelled her as I came in. You know she\u2019s been at the club, rehearsing, performing. Caine just made that go all to hell, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he didn\u2019t. Not if I have anything to say about it.\u201d Sienna opened the bathroom door and stepped into the room, proving that men dream of genies because they are hot, hot, hot.</p><p>\u201cSienna.\u201d Rafe finally managed to pull his tongue back into his mouth and speak. \u201cLooking good.\u201d Understatement, if the way his eyes swept up and down her body was any indication.</p><p>\u201cThanks. So can you find us someone to hire? To do the bodyguard gig?\u201d Sienna leaned against my worktable.</p><p>I tried not to stare. The costume fit perfectly, if cramming D-cup breasts into a B-cup bra was perfect. Rafe obviously thought so. He couldn\u2019t look away. The sheer harem pants clung low, well below her navel, and I saw that Sienna had a piercing there, a ring with a diamond. It was a nice touch. She\u2019d kept her feet bare, her turquoise polish matching the trim on the gold outfit. The top had sheer long sleeves which helped disguise her blue dots and she must have brought along the concealer because the dots on her chest were barely noticeable. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t hand this off to someone else. I\u2019ll figure out a way to do it myself.\u201d Rafe tore his gaze from Sienna long enough to take a breath and stare at a spot between us.</p><p>\u201cYou have a club to run. And, frankly, I can\u2019t afford your rates.\u201d I knew he was expensive, I\u2019d seen the bill he\u2019d sent to Jerry.</p><p>\u201cAs if I\u2019d charge you, Glory.\u201d He grabbed my hand before I could stop him. \u201cSeriously, this is messed up. How Blade got involved with a nut-job like this woman is bad enough, but to put you in danger . . .\u201d He squeezed my fingers, focused on me now. \u201cI\u2019m going to have a talk with him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, Rafe. You two don\u2019t talk and you know it. That conversation will end up in a fight.\u201d I laid my other hand on his chest. His heart was thumping, fast. And he was so warm, shifter warm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave you two to thrash this out, but, Rafe?\u201d Sienna stopped with her hand on the doorknob. \u201cI can afford to pay you. We need security. Whether this woman is an issue or not. I\u2019ll need it when I go out on the road again too. Maybe you can hook me up with some guys you trust to be my new security team.\u201d She looked down at her toes, curled under. \u201cI\u2019m still figuring things out but I\u2019m not letting Ray take my career away from me. I\u2019ll be back onstage no matter what I have to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for you.\u201d Rafe smiled at her. \u201cGlory can help. She\u2019s figured out how to live among mortals for centuries. Blending, she calls it. It\u2019ll be tougher for you because you\u2019re a public figure, but even that asshole Ray Caine has managed it for the past year. That should show you it\u2019s possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. If he can do it, I can. I can\u2019t believe we sang together at the Grammys.\u201d Sienna glanced at me. \u201cHe was vampire then, Glory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure was. And you didn\u2019t have a clue, did you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, just got pissed because of his weird rehearsal schedule. And you know the label went along with it. Is Chip?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cNaw. Now I\u2019m thinking everyone, even the label\u2019s owner, is a vampire. How stupid is that?\u201d She looked down at herself. \u201cWhat do you think, Rafe? Is this the costume I should wear on Halloween? We\u2019re singing at your club. Or we\u2019re supposed to. Ray and I. Not sure I can stand to be onstage with him again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPublicity has gone out. You\u2019re committed. I\u2019ve got your signed contract. Of course you can do it.\u201d Rafe let go of my hand and stepped toward her. \u201cAnd wear that costume. Let Caine see what he lost by being a stupid jerk. Used you as his blood donor, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. And lost control. Typical addict behavior.\u201d She shuddered. \u201cDamn, I\u2019m going to have to watch myself. Stay away from mortal boyfriends.\u201d Her eyes filled and Rafe settled his hands on her narrow shoulders. I thought for a moment that he was going to pull her close and my stomach did a three-sixty. Stupid. I had no right to be jealous.</p><p>\u201cIf you learned nothing else from this fiasco, it\u2019s that mortal bedmates are the wrong play. Look what happened to you. Stick to paranormals who can hold their own around you.\u201d He nodded toward me. \u201cHave a long talk with Glory about the joys of paranormal sex.\u201d He grinned and winked. \u201cHard to beat, right, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Rafe.\u201d I felt my cheeks go hot. \u201cSienna, you look great. Buy it. I\u2019ll give you a discount.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She winked at me. \u201cParanormal sex. Oh, yeah. I want all the details.\u201d She brushed a fingertip down Rafe\u2019s black tee with the red N-V logo. \u201cBut a demo would be even better.\u201d</p> <p>Rafe cleared his throat. \u201cSlow down, Sin.\u201d He glanced at me. \u201cHow long you been a vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty-four hours, more or less.\u201d She smiled. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not a fan of slow unless it\u2019s\u2014\u201d She leaned close and whispered in his ear.</p><p>Rafe actually flushed. \u201cOh, yeah, I hear you. If I hadn\u2019t just told my girlfriend I was all in, I\u2019d be up for that.\u201d He stepped back from her with a grin. \u201cBut just now the timing\u2019s off.\u201d He turned to me. \u201cGuarding you again, Glory. Not sure how that\u2019s going to go over with my girl either. But I\u2019ll handle it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, Rafe! Maybe you shouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d I knew Lacy wouldn\u2019t be happy that he was riding to my rescue again. Of course he\u2019d be there when I was dead. Lights out. Maybe Lacy would be cool with that.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. She lives across the hall from you. She can keep me company when you\u2019re out during the day.\u201d Rafe shrugged. \u201cIf she can\u2019t handle that, then maybe we aren\u2019t meant to be, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. I can talk to her.\u201d I really didn\u2019t want to make his love life fall apart. I\u2019d caused him enough pain in the past. And Lacy was my day manager. I didn\u2019t want to alienate her either. This had been a bad idea all the way around.</p><p>\u201cStay out of it. I\u2019m doing this, no arguments.\u201d He didn\u2019t smile, suddenly all business. \u201cNow, Sienna, get dressed. Glory, does Blade know you called me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, no.\u201d I pulled my cell out of my pocket, dreading the conversation. \u201cHe was going to see Mel. To try to get her to back off.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, how\u2019s that worked so far?\u201d He watched Sienna strut into the bathroom with a twitch of her hips then shook his head as she shut the door with a finger wave.</p><p>\u201cIt hasn\u2019t. I\u2019m calling him now.\u201d I tried and my call went straight to voice mail.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it, Rafe. Jer always answers.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cHas it occurred to you that this woman may get tired of Blade\u2019s rejection?\u201d He put his hand on top of mine that was holding the phone.</p><p>\u201cSeriously? Oh, God. Maybe Jerry is the one who needs the bodyguard.\u201d I looked down at the phone and tried his number again. No answer. A woman scorned. Maybe I wasn\u2019t her only target.</p><p>Five</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll worry about Blade later.\u201d Rafe glanced at his watch when Sienna emerged from the bathroom back in her own clothes. \u201cWind up this transaction then let\u2019s head up to your place. I want to look around. See if there are signs of a breakin. You said she got in yesterday, during the day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I think so. Otherwise how could she manage to tamper with my laptop camera, the one I use for a mirror? Fill it with freakin\u2019 bees?\u201d I followed Sienna out to the register. \u201cMegan, give Miss Star a twenty percent discount on this outfit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Megan took the two pieces and carefully wrapped them in tissue paper. She gushed over Sienna, running her credit card then asking for an autograph after she signed the receipt.</p><p>\u201cDo we have to hurry back upstairs?\u201d Sienna glanced around. \u201cI see a few other things I might want to buy. My mother collects vintage jewelry. It\u2019s never too early to shop for Christmas.\u201d She grabbed my arm. \u201cOh, my God. My mom and dad. I\u2019ll have to tell . . .\u201d She squeezed until I yelped.</p><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re hurting me. Relax. We\u2019ll figure things out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. I\u2019ll never get old and they will.\u201d Tears filled her eyes. \u201cHow can I handle that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSienna, I honestly don\u2019t know.\u201d I patted her hand, realizing she was right to be upset and I didn\u2019t know how to make her feel better. I\u2019d been through this with Ray but it wasn\u2019t any easier the second time around. \u201cTake this change one step at a time. You can come back here tomorrow night. Shop some more. And we\u2019ll talk. About what to tell your family. Right now Rafe\u2019s right. We need to go back up and let him assess the situation. Dawn is only a couple of hours away.\u201d Which worried me. Why wasn\u2019t Jerry answering his phone? Had he found Mel? What were they doing? Or worse, what was she doing to him?</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019m freaking out, but I can\u2019t seem to relax.\u201d She glanced out the plate glass window. \u201cAnd check it, paparazzi. Those people who were here earlier must have taken a picture and posted it online. That\u2019s all it takes to get those creeps to crawl out from under their rocks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go out the back. The door into the apartments is just a few steps from there.\u201d Rafe grabbed Sienna\u2019s bag and hustled us toward the storeroom. \u201cHurry and we can beat them there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should face them, say something.\u201d Sienna held on to the counter, halting our progress.</p><p>\u201cLike what, Sienna?\u201d I again had that feeling, my instincts warning me that she was up to something I wouldn\u2019t like.</p><p>\u201cGive them a scoop. Tell them Ray isn\u2019t what he seems, the bastard. That would teach him to suck a woman\u2019s blood when she\u2019s basically unconscious.\u201d Her eyes flashed and her fangs were down.</p><p>I darted glances everywhere. No customers inside but I saw flashes that meant the photographers outside were trying to get a picture through the window. Luckily my new Halloween displays, spiderwebs and all, and the lighting would keep them from getting a clear shot.</p><p>\u201cStop it! Are you crazy?\u201d I dragged her into the back room, Rafe helping. \u201cYou will not start rumors that could out all of us. We fly under the radar and it\u2019s going to stay that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? I think it\u2019s cool that we\u2019re superstrong and run and jump better than Olympic athletes. And that shape-shifting thing? Totally awesome.\u201d She jerked her arm out of my grip. \u201cWe could rule the world, Glo. Staying hidden in the shadows is nuts. Think of the lost opportunities. Why I\u2019d have millions more fans who\u2019d come hear me sing just on the off chance that I\u2019d show fang or jump off the stage and bite one of them.\u201d She laughed. Laughed!</p><p>\u201cShut the hell up. You have no idea what you\u2019re saying. I\u2019ve been on the sharp end of a stake, stalked by a vampire hunter. Trust me, there\u2019s no way we\u2019re going public.\u201d When she started to argue, there was no help for it. I grabbed her chin and looked into her eyes. In a moment she was mesmerized and staring into space. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to be trouble.\u201d Rafe picked her up and heaved her over his shoulder. He bumped into a chair which fell over with a crash.</p><p>\u201cNo kidding.\u201d I flinched when Megan stepped into the storeroom to see what the commotion was about. She stared wide-eyed and speechless at Sienna, a limp accessory that Rafe adjusted as he reached for the back doorknob. I shrugged, not ready to explain too much though I was sure she\u2019d heard everything. Damned paranormal hearing.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a shame, Megan. These rock stars. Blame Sienna\u2019s erratic behavior on something she must have taken. I hope she hasn\u2019t fallen off the wagon again.\u201d I knew Megan could smell her, had figured out Sienna was now vampire. But this raving about letting vampires be known to the world was the worst kind of betrayal of our kind.</p> <p>\u201cGlory, are you sure? I heard her. Rule the world? That\u2019s crazy talk.\u201d Megan followed us to the door that led to the alley. \u201cYou are going to nip this in the bud, aren\u2019t you? Because first it\u2019s the vamps, then the shifters can\u2019t be far behind. I\u2019ll report her to the vampire council myself if I think she\u2019s a danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I\u2019ve got this. Sienna\u2019s staying with me. I\u2019m mentoring her and giving her the four-one-one on the life. Trust me. She\u2019s still really new but I\u2019ll get her under control.\u201d I tried for a confident smile. \u201cI know you\u2019ll keep her crazy outburst our secret. She had no idea what she was saying. When she understands how outnumbered we are, she\u2019ll cool it with the going public thing.\u201d</p><p>Megan held the door while Rafe checked the alley then made a beeline for the door into the apartments and hit the code to open it.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d better. You\u2019ve had enough trouble with the few vampire hunters who have figured out you guys exist. I remember how it was when that fellow Westwood was after you. Nightmare.\u201d Megan shivered, wrapping her arms around herself. \u201cThank God the cats are still a secret. But make vamps common knowledge and there\u2019d be stake kiosks popping up in malls everywhere before you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for that image, Megan.\u201d I hurried after Rafe. \u201cLock this door behind us. If anyone asks, Sienna shopped and left, going out the back to avoid the paparazzi. You have no idea where she\u2019s staying.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGot it. Just take care of this. None of us, my cat family, the other paranormals, want to go public. We like our life in the shadows. It\u2019s the only safe place.\u201d She jumped when car lights appeared at the end of the alley. \u201cHurry, you may have company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall if you need me.\u201d I darted inside and locked the door into the apartments behind me, arming the security system with a shaking finger. First Jerry was out of pocket and now Sienna had gone off the rails. How much more could I take? My phone rang. A number I didn\u2019t recognize. I couldn\u2019t afford to ignore any calls.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlory, it\u2019s Cait. Bart and I are sitting outside Jeremiah\u2019s house. He\u2019s not answering his phone and the house is dark. Do you know where he is? Is he with you?\u201d</p><p>Cait, Caitlin Campbell, Jerry\u2019s sister. I\u2019d forgotten she and her new boyfriend, Dr. Bartholomew O\u2019Connor, were arriving from Scotland tonight. They\u2019d arranged to pick up a rental car at the airport and meet us at Jerry\u2019s house. But with everything going on . . .</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m sorry. Of course you\u2019re supposed to stay with Jerry. He keeps a key in the birdhouse, behind the garage.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI see it. You\u2019ve got to be kidding me. I have to shift or climb that pole?\u201d Cait said a few choice words in one of the many foreign languages she knew.</p><p>\u201cIt seemed like a good idea at the time.\u201d I laughed at the idea of Cait shimmying up the pole. \u201cDo the bird thing then push it out to Bart on the ground with your beak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, thanks. Like I couldn\u2019t figure that out. Stay on the line. I\u2019m making Bart shift because he just laughed at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Cait. Let yourself in the back door. I\u2019m sure Jerry\u2019ll be sorry he missed you, but make yourself at home. Hopefully he\u2019ll be there soon.\u201d I trudged up the stairs and saw my apartment door standing open. Guess Rafe still had one of my keys and had let himself in. He\u2019d dumped Sienna on the couch, where she stared vacant-eyed at the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cCait?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it. Bart pushed it out but it\u2019s got bird poop on it. Oh, but my brother\u2019s never going to hear the end of this. Where did you say he went?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t. He took off, said he had an errand, and that\u2019s the last I heard from him. I\u2019d say come over here but I have a full house at the moment.\u201d I tried not to groan at the thought of cramming two more into my tiny apartment. Vamps don\u2019t like to use hotels, problems with housekeeping during the daily death sleep.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong, Glory? You don\u2019t sound right. You did say Jerry got his memory back, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Cait sounded distracted and I heard water running. Washing bird poop off that key I guess.</p> <p>\u201cOh, his memory\u2019s fine and he was looking forward to your visit.\u201d I gestured when Rafe glanced at me with a question in his eyes. He finally just sat in a chair and waited for me to get off the phone. \u201cThere are some things going on though, Cait. I\u2019ll explain tomorrow night. I imagine you and Bart would like to get settled. Rest up after your flight. I heard Bart flew you here in his own plane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s right. We had a layover in Miami, did a bit of sightseeing, then came on here. He\u2019s an excellent pilot. Okay, we\u2019re going in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Explore Jer\u2019s house. He has a couple of guest rooms. Pick out one or two, however many you need, and unpack. Hopefully he\u2019ll get there before dawn.\u201d I sighed. \u201cIf I hear from him, I\u2019ll have him call you. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute. You said there are things going on. Glory, I don\u2019t like the sound of that.\u201d Cait murmured something to Bart. \u201cIs Jeremiah in danger, Glory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe may be. Look, it\u2019s a woman who wants him for herself. She\u2019s being a pain but I doubt she\u2019d hurt him. It\u2019s me she\u2019s after.\u201d I realized Rafe had moved closer and laid his hand on my back, comforting me. \u201cBut I am worried about him. He took off earlier, looking for her. To tell her to quit hassling me. I expected to hear from him before now, to tell me how she took that ultimatum. Not well, I\u2019m sure. She\u2019s extremely jealous but, like I said, I can\u2019t believe she\u2019d hurt him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she should be jealous. Of course Jeremiah is in love with you. I can\u2019t imagine him with another woman.\u201d Cait said something to Bart. \u201cWhat do you need? We want to help. We can search, stay here and call if he shows up, whatever you think best. Just tell us what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Caitie.\u201d Tears filled my eyes. I did count her as a good friend. \u201cThank Bart too. Just stay there and make Jerry call me when he shows up. I\u2019m worried sick. This woman is into voodoo. I have no idea what she might be doing to him when she hears what he has to say. He was determined to break it off with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlory, it\u2019s Bart. Voodoo? I know something about that. I studied in the Caribbean for a while. It\u2019s an interesting practice but can be dangerous in the wrong hands.\u201d Bart had taken Cait\u2019s phone. Vamp hearing. Of course he\u2019d been listening to our conversation. \u201cDo you have any idea if she\u2019s used any spells on Jerry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t think so, but then he seems almost addicted to her blood. He doesn\u2019t have a problem when he\u2019s not around her, but when he\u2019s near . . . I don\u2019t know. She\u2019s done some things to his hotel in Miami, caused problems, accidents. To get him to go there. That\u2019s her base of operations. He won\u2019t tell me details but he can\u2019t seem to stay away from her when he gets close enough to smell her blood.\u201d I gripped the phone hard, my hand hurting from the crystal case that bit into my palm. I kept seeing Jerry at Mel\u2019s vein. Such an intimate act. Sexual with the right person.</p><p>\u201cGlory, you still there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarely. Does that sound like a spell to you, Bart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly could be. Have you met her? What can you tell me about her?\u201d</p><p>I told him all I knew, even about the recent breakin during the day. He was as horrified as I\u2019d been.</p><p>\u201cThis woman sounds very proficient in the arts. You\u2019re right to take her threats seriously. It\u2019s possible Jerry is under a spell of some kind. Let me do some research. What\u2019s her name?\u201d</p><p>I could almost visualize Bart taking out his ever-present notebook. He was old school, preferring pen and paper to a tablet computer.</p><p>\u201cMelisandra Du Monde.\u201d The very name made me sick and I finally sat in a chair, taking the bottle of synthetic Rafe handed me. \u201cIf she\u2019s put Jerry under some kind of spell . . . Oh, God. I don\u2019t want to think about that. Thanks, Bart. I could use some help. I\u2019m also reaching out to a voodoo queen in New Orleans. I\u2019m hoping she has some ideas about how to shut this woman down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s worth a try, though there are different kinds of voodoo. I\u2019ll see what I can dig up on Ms. Du Monde. Maybe I can find out which practice she\u2019s likely to use. Don\u2019t give up, Glory. Cait and I are here for you. Now she wants to talk to you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlory, Bart\u2019s right. We\u2019ve got your back. You need anything, call or text. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Now I\u2019ve got something going on here. Talk to you tomorrow night.\u201d I ended the call and took a deep swallow of my drink.</p><p>\u201cBlade\u2019s sister is here?\u201d Rafe sat in the chair opposite me.</p><p>\u201cYes, with her boyfriend, a doctor. Smart man, and I just found out he knows about voodoo. That\u2019ll come in handy. Bart tried to help Jerry in Scotland when Jer first got amnesia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know.\u201d Rafe glanced at Sienna. \u201cFirst things first. What are we going to do about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wake her up and then she\u2019s going to have to get a freaking clue.\u201d I leaned forward. \u201cDamn it, Rafe. I don\u2019t need this right now. I\u2019m worried about Jerry, about myself for that matter, and now she thinks we ought to go public? No way in hell.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRelax, Glory. You can handle her. Wake her up.\u201d Rafe took my empty bottle then sat back to watch.</p><p>\u201cGlad one of us is confident.\u201d I snapped my fingers in front of Sienna\u2019s eyes. \u201cWake up, Sienna. We need to talk.\u201d</p><p>She sat up, her eyes wild. \u201cWhat the hell did you do to me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMesmerized you. It\u2019s a handy skill, the same one Ray used when he drank your blood. But it\u2019s one I won\u2019t be teaching you just yet. You have to earn the privilege.\u201d I sat in my chair again. \u201cThat stunt you pulled in the shop pissed me off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStunt? What did I do?\u201d She brushed back her hair with one hand and swung her legs down from the couch to sit facing me.</p><p>\u201cYou raved about making vampires public. That\u2019s never going to happen. Never. If you start that kind of talk again, I may let the vampire council have you. They\u2019ll lock you in a coffin in the council leader\u2019s basement until you come to your senses. Learn to behave like a proper vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a damn minute.\u201d She jumped to her feet. \u201cNo one locks me up. No one. For one thing I\u2019m claustrophobic. I\u2019d go crazy. For another, I\u2019m a public figure. Don\u2019t you think people will notice if I just disappear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRehab. Again. We can put out the story and no one will doubt it. Poor Sienna Star just can\u2019t stay off the pills, booze, whatever your drug of choice is these days. You\u2019ve been hustled off to a secret location to dry out.\u201d I watched her pace the room.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare. I worked too damned hard for my sobriety.\u201d She pulled a coin out of her pocket. \u201cThree hundred and sixty seven days and counting. I\u2019ll never go back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for you. But the public will believe anything we tell them.\u201d I frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem. You start spouting stories about vampires being real and there\u2019ll be a panic. Sure, the movies are cool, the idea of vampires is sexy. But the reality of fanged monsters in alleys, wanting to drink mortal blood? Scary as hell. We\u2019ll become targets and innocent people will be killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInnocent? Are you telling me you\u2019re innocent?\u201d Sienna collapsed on the couch again. \u201cCome on, in four hundred years have you always been satisfied with sipping bottled juice or taking an occasional drink from a mortal? And tell me, Glory, did you always leave that mortal able to walk away in good shape after you quenched your thirst? Look at what Ray did to me. I almost died. Are you telling me you never had one of those little accidents back in the day?\u201d She stared at me, probing my mind. Fast learner.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not telling you anything. My past is my business. What I am making clear is that you will never kill anyone. You\u2019ll drink synthetic or find a mortal now and then who\u2019ll give you blood willingly. Cautiously, not with a shout-out to the tabloids. Maybe this mortal\u2019ll do it out of love or for money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I heard that.\u201d Aggie stood in the doorway. Her nightgown was right out of my shop, a vintage piece that, if I\u2019d known she\u2019d taken it, I would have ripped right out of her greedy hands. It was damned expensive and way too revealing to wear in front of Rafe. He was noticing of course, one eyebrow raised.</p><p>\u201cAggie, go back to bed or put on more clothes.\u201d I didn\u2019t need this right now.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I heard what you said. Sienna can pay a mortal for her blood?\u201d Aggie trailed a finger along her jugular. \u201cIan always told me I had delicious blood. I\u2019ll be happy to donate. For a price.\u201d</p><p>I jumped up and got a robe from my bedroom. \u201cPut this on.\u201d I wasn\u2019t going to stop the negotiations. If this helped Aggie pay off her debts so she could get out of my apartment sooner, she could sell her entire body to Sienna if she wanted to. Consenting adults. I could care less.</p><p>\u201cSeriously? You\u2019d let me bite you? For money?\u201d Sienna got up and strolled over to sniff Aggie. She leaned in, putting her nose close to Aggie\u2019s neck. \u201cIt does smell really good. And you\u2019re clean, though I could do without that perfume. Lose it if you become my donor.\u201d She sneezed then glanced at me. \u201cYou seem to be calling the shots here, Glory. Am I allowed to pay this woman for her blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? I\u2019ll have to teach you how to count, so you won\u2019t take too much blood at a time. We\u2019re not taking a chance on another incident like Ray\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to be responsible . . .\u201d Sienna kept eying Aggie. \u201cI\u2019d probably prefer a hot guy but I guess if we do it at the wrist . . . Really? Can I do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so. Aggie needs the money and you can do it here, in the apartment. At least until I think it\u2019s okay for you to be on your own. It\u2019s a pretty safe arrangement.\u201d I glanced at Aggie. Of course she hadn\u2019t closed that robe, still flashing Rafe. Aggie was always about impressing men and hadn\u2019t given up the idea of finding a rich man to support her. Rafe was doing well, but wasn\u2019t nearly rich enough to afford the former Siren.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m game.\u201d Aggie plopped down on the couch. \u201cGlory\u2019s right. I need the cash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cName your terms, Aggie.\u201d I wondered how much she\u2019d ask for.</p> <p>\u201cFive hundred bucks a pop.\u201d Aggie leaned back and crossed her legs. \u201cSeems reasonable to me. I\u2019m like takeout. Right here, curb service, so to speak. Feel free to leave a tip.\u201d</p><p>Sienna narrowed her gaze. \u201cThree. I think you\u2019re trying to rip me off.\u201d</p><p>Of course Aggie was, but it surprised me that Sienna was into negotiating. By the time they were done, Aggie was getting four hundred and some perks to be named later. I had a feeling Sienna would regret that last part. But at least we weren\u2019t still arguing about the vampire publicity issue.</p><p>Rafe had been prowling around the apartment, checking windows, the door, all the locks. Now he pulled me into the kitchen while Sienna took her first drink from Aggie\u2019s wrist. I had told her how to count but wanted to watch the time myself and to keep an eye on them.</p><p>\u201cYou have a pretty tight situation here. I\u2019m not sure how this woman got in. She must\u2019ve used her powers.\u201d He was serious.</p><p>\u201cI hate to hear that. How do we fight it?\u201d I was counting in my head, ready to stop Sienna if she drank too long.</p><p>\u201cI want to use the element of surprise. Much as I hate to do it, we\u2019ll lure her in. Make her think you\u2019re unprotected during the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSienna, that\u2019s enough. Pull out.\u201d I was relieved when she actually did, using a paper towel I\u2019d left on the coffee table to wipe her mouth. \u201cLick the puncture wounds closed. It makes them disappear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I have to? That seems, um, icky.\u201d Sienna jumped up from the couch where Aggie lay, moaning, like she\u2019d suffered great pain.</p><p>\u201cReally? You want to leave me scarred too? I think a rabid dog would bite with more finesse than you just did.\u201d Aggie waved her arm in the air. \u201cCheck it out, Glory. This newbie gnawed me like an old bone. I\u2019m mangled. Don\u2019t you think she should kick in a bonus for pain and suffering?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive it up, Aggie. You knew donating wasn\u2019t going to be a joyride. You\u2019re already charging plenty for this. Go ahead, Sienna. We never leave evidence of a feeding on a mortal.\u201d I crossed my arms, giving the rocker a stern look.</p><p>\u201cFine, whatever, but no bonus.\u201d Sienna licked her finger and swiped it across the puncture marks on Aggie\u2019s wrist.</p><p>\u201cI hope you get better at the biting. Glory, give her some lessons. Make her bite her own wrist till she gets it right.\u201d Aggie yawned and stretched, showing us all that the robe had slipped off and her gown was sheer.</p><p>\u201cNo pain, no gain. Deal with it.\u201d Sienna pulled her checkbook out of her purse, her cheeks flushed from feeding. I moved aside when Aggie got up and headed for the fridge. She picked out a pineapple yogurt and grabbed a spoon.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a bitch about it. Now I\u2019m hungry.\u201d Aggie swallowed a spoonful then suddenly grinned. \u201cHey, this blood donor thing might help with my diet. You vampires don\u2019t know how lucky you are, stuck in your bodies. Oh, except for Glory, of course. Glo, you should sue Jerry for turning you on one of your fat days.\u201d She tossed the lid in the trash. \u201cI\u2019m going back to bed. I\u2019ll take a check or cash, Sin. No credit cards. You can leave it on the kitchen table. I have to get up early tomorrow. Did Glory tell you? I have to clean my former lover\u2019s house. Bastard. I\u2019m getting my own little revenge, though. Washed his sheets in a detergent that\u2019s sure to make him itch. Underwear and socks too.\u201d She cackled, stopping in the door to the hall to take another bite of yogurt. \u201cAnd the glasses he uses to drink his synthetic blood from? Washed them in the toilet. Hah!\u201d She strutted down the hall with a wave of her spoon. \u201cNight all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBitch.\u201d Sienna and I said it together, then exchanged looks.</p><p>\u201cYes, she is. Long story to explain why I\u2019m stuck with her here. I\u2019m seriously wondering if I\u2019ve lost my mind. She\u2019s one more cutting remark away from being tossed out on her butt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho would blame you? I sure wouldn\u2019t want to be on her bad side though.\u201d Sienna grabbed her tote. \u201cI\u2019m going to shower. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. And you\u2019re right. I\u2019ve been there. On Aggie\u2019s bad side. Of course that was before she was mortal. She goes too far around me now and I can definitely make her regret it.\u201d Rafe and I slapped palms. \u201cHow was the blood, Sienna? Worth it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotally. So much better than synthetic.\u201d Sienna dropped a check on the kitchen table then started toward the bathroom. She stopped in the doorway. \u201cHow often should I feed from her? This could get expensive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can supplement with synthetic. Try once a week, twice if you just can\u2019t stand the synthetic after the real deal. The bloodlust hits new vamps pretty hard. Luckily, the older you get, the less often you have to feed. The main thing is to not let yourself get too thirsty. It can make you lose control and do something you might regret.\u201d I had to admit I envied her the funds that allowed her to have a mortal donor like that. The real thing was better, but I wasn\u2019t about to stalk hapless victims like a lot of vamps did, including Jerry. It was a subject he and I didn\u2019t discuss since he knew I disapproved of his drinking habit. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou mean like attack an innocent bystander. Taking down one of those assholes with a camera wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea.\u201d Sienna laughed when I started to squawk. \u201cKidding. I have been listening to you, Glory. And the last person I\u2019d drink from would be a member of the paparazzi. Bunch of user losers.\u201d Sienna scowled and disappeared into the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cFinally, a few minutes of alone time. Tell me quick, Rafe, about this plan of yours. How are you going to give the illusion that we are unprotected?\u201d I settled onto the couch.</p><p>\u201cDo the dog thing again. Valdez back in action.\u201d He grinned and shifted. Now he was a black Labradoodle, cute with curly fur and dark eyes that were the same as they\u2019d been for five years while he\u2019d guarded me, employed by Jerry.</p> <p>\u201cOh, no, you can\u2019t do that to yourself. You hated it.\u201d I shook my head as he jumped on the couch. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>Back then he\u2019d communicated in my mind, especially when we were in public. This time he just spoke using his mouth, which looked freaky in a dog but was something I could handle. \u201cI figure that if she tries to come after you and sees you asleep in your bed with only a dog to protect you, she\u2019ll try something, figure she can stake you. I can take her, I know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you could if she were a mere mortal. But, Rafe, if she\u2019s using voodoo spells . . . ?\u201d I ran my hand over his head and tugged one ear. So soft. \u201cThis is dangerous. We need to find out more about her powers. Have some magical weapons of our own. Flo is getting me the phone number of a voodoo priestess down in New Orleans. Even if it\u2019s a different kind of voodoo, maybe we can get some spells of our own to throw at Mel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you tell Bart that. That\u2019s good. But in the meantime, I\u2019ll be here during the day today. And Blade certainly can\u2019t object if I\u2019m in my dog persona. You know how he can be.\u201d He lay down, his head in my lap. Trust Rafe to get close while he had the chance. I couldn\u2019t push him away.</p><p>\u201cIs that why you\u2019re doing it, the dog thing? To keep things cool between Jerry and me?\u201d I rubbed his ears. \u201cI know he\u2019s been jealous in the past, but I think we\u2019ve worked through that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood. But staying in dog form can\u2019t hurt. I\u2019m mainly doing it to trick the bitch who came after you. She invaded your space when you would\u2019ve been defenseless. I\u2019m scared for you.\u201d He raised his head and bumped my chin.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Rafe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this? Where\u2019d the dog come from?\u201d Sienna emerged from the bathroom in a tank and boxers. Obviously she was ready for bed. She was going to have to sleep on the couch and we were sitting on it. Which was a problem. If Mel came into the apartment, the first vampire she\u2019d encounter would be Sienna. Would she attack her? Just because she hated vampires who weren\u2019t Jerry? I couldn\u2019t run that risk.</p><p>\u201cTake my bed for today, Sienna. I\u2019ll sleep out here. We\u2019re dead during the day so it really doesn\u2019t matter where we land and Rafe wants to be close to the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut where is he? And what about the dog? Where\u2019d he come from? I thought Rafe was supposed to be protecting us.\u201d She had scrubbed off her makeup and I was glad to see that her recent feeding had done some good, fading those blue spots on her face and arms.</p><p>\u201cRafe\u2019s here.\u201d I patted his back. \u201cThis is how he protected me when he was my bodyguard. Cute, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou are shittin\u2019 me.\u201d Sienna moved closer. \u201cYes, he\u2019s a cute dog, but I can\u2019t believe . . . Say something, Rafe. So I know it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true. And Glory\u2019s right. We\u2019ll sleep out here. Close to the door in case anyone tries to bother you guys during the day. If they do, I can be in human form in a heartbeat and take them down.\u201d Rafe woofed for good measure when Sienna squealed.</p><p>\u201cThat is so freaking amazing. Shape-shifter. Holy crap. I remember you now, the cute Labradoodle hanging around Glory when I first met her. I had no idea . . . I wouldn\u2019t have believed this if I hadn\u2019t seen it with my own eyes.\u201d She yawned. \u201cMust be close to dawn. I can hardly keep my eyes open. Thanks for the bed, Glory. Night.\u201d She smiled before she headed into the bedroom. \u201cAnd thanks for guarding us, Rafe. Appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>I pushed Rafe off my lap and got up to get bedding out of the linen closet. It was no problem to make up the bed. I could feel the dawn too but worry about Jerry made me resist the pull. I tried his cell one more time. No answer. Where could he be? Had Mel done something to him? I headed into the bathroom to wash and change into a sexless sleep shirt, my Snoopy one, to razz Rafe.</p><p>Just before I passed out, I tried Jerry once more. Voice mail. I didn\u2019t bother leaving a fourth message. If he had his phone, he knew I was worried and looking for him. Obviously he couldn\u2019t call me or he would have. Dawn edged even closer and I prayed he was where daylight couldn\u2019t touch him. Surely Mel wouldn\u2019t hurt him. Unless she finally got the message that he didn\u2019t want her. I needed to check out her Web site, but dawn hit before I could reach for my laptop.</p><p>Six</p><p>I woke up with a start at sunset. The worry I\u2019d gone to bed with was still there. I smelled coffee and knew that Rafe must have morphed back into his human form and was fixing breakfast for himself. In the bad old days, when he\u2019d been forced to stay in dog form twenty-four/seven, he\u2019d subsisted on Twinkies, his favorite snack, and rare steaks when I\u2019d cook for him.</p><p>I tried Jerry\u2019s cell again. No answer. So I got dressed and took my laptop into the living room before I found Mel\u2019s Web site. She had quite a professional setup. And there was a place to contact her. I composed a message. But when I found myself begging her to let Jerry go, I deleted it. I had no way of knowing if Jerry was even with her. Maybe he\u2019d lost his phone and had arrived home just before dawn. I ran through various scenarios in my mind but kept coming up with no real excuse for him not to call me back unless he was hurt . . . No, impossible. Mel claimed to love him. She would never hurt him.</p> <p>So I scrolled through the woman\u2019s Web site. No wonder she was so successful. Even I got sucked in by her inspiring message. \u201cBe the master of your own fate. Take control of your life. You can own the world. The only thing limiting your reach is your own fear.\u201d Her words resonated and if I hadn\u2019t met the bitch I\u2019d be tempted to sign up for one of her seminars. In fact, she was holding one here in Austin this weekend, at a hotel downtown. I gasped when I saw the price she was charging. Yeah, I bet she owned her world. Unbelievable. The large ballroom was almost sold out.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s doing?\u201d Rafe stood behind me, reading over my shoulder. \u201cShe actually gets that price?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently. Look, only three spots left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should go. It\u2019ll be nice to get our minds off the vampire drama.\u201d Sienna had joined Rafe and read the description too. \u201cI\u2019ll buy the tickets. The woman sounds fabulous. Look, Glory, you could take your shop to a whole new level. End up with a string of Vintage Vamp\u2019s Emporiums all over the world.\u201d She patted me on the shoulder. \u201cI want to thank you for mentoring me. Let\u2019s go to this. It sounds good.\u201d She bumped against Rafe\u2019s shoulder. \u201cAnd the bodyguard can come. In human form. I doubt they\u2019d let the dog in. Even though your Labradoodle thing is cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d do it again if that\u2019s what she needed to stay safe.\u201d Rafe wasn\u2019t taking Sienna up on the flirting. Guess he was serious about Lacy.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea why I\u2019m looking at this Web site, Sienna. And take you to a ballroom full of mortals? Not a good idea.\u201d We\u2019d never mentioned Jerry\u2019s stalker chick by name other than Mel. Her picture here showed a professional woman who looked nothing like a voodoo priestess.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ll fill up before I go. Come on, Glory. You hit this site for a reason. You going to deny she\u2019s got something you want?\u201d Sienna flashed me a smile.</p><p>The bitch\u2019s head on a plate. But I didn\u2019t say that. Instead, I took a breath. Did I want to hear Mel speak? Definitely. Even if it was only to get a better idea of the enemy I faced. What would she do if I walked into one of her seminars? Probably smile smugly and go right on with her spiel.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing you want more out of life than a small boutique. Not that it isn\u2019t great. I love your little shop. It\u2019s cool and you have great taste. But it could use more marketing. Expansion.\u201d She glanced around my tiny apartment with its used furniture. The only new piece was the massive coffee table Jerry and Rafe had bought after they\u2019d destroyed my old one during a fight. \u201cSeems like you need to increase your income. This seminar could be a good thing for you.\u201d</p><p>I exchanged glances with Rafe, who\u2019d moved around the couch to settle into the chair across from me. He\u2019d made himself an egg sandwich. Now he took a bite and raised an eyebrow. Okay, he was thinking this might not be a bad move. I decided then and there that Sienna didn\u2019t need to know the truth about this woman\u2019s identity.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019ve got a small life, that\u2019s what this woman calls it, and I\u2019ve been satisfied with it. But maybe it\u2019s time to think bigger. Going to this seminar might give me some ideas. Thanks, Sienna, I\u2019ll take you up on the offer. You handle the tickets. Do you have a name you use when you don\u2019t want to be recognized?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure. And a special credit card for just that purpose. I\u2019ll put the tickets on that one.\u201d She snatched her purse off the kitchen table. \u201cI\u2019d better hurry before they\u2019re sold out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I patted the seat next to me then handed her the laptop.</p><p>\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t at night, we wouldn\u2019t be able to do this. I still can\u2019t wrap my head around all the limitations . . . Well, you don\u2019t want to get me started on that.\u201d She pulled her credit card out of her wallet and began typing. \u201cI need this distraction so I won\u2019t go over to Ray\u2019s and try to kill him again. This night out will be nice. The three of us going somewhere together. I\u2019ll be in disguise of course. I have a long black wig and sunglasses that I wear when I\u2019m hiding from the paparazzi. You\u2019ll see. No one will have a clue I\u2019m there.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll wear a disguise too. Just for fun.\u201d I winked at Rafe. \u201cWhy not go? It couldn\u2019t hurt to hear some new ideas. I would definitely like to increase my cash flow.\u201d I glanced around my apartment too. Why had I been satisfied with such a subpar lifestyle? I hated to admit that Mel\u2019s words were getting to me. Live large. Go for it. Don\u2019t be satisfied with less than the best.</p><p>Since I\u2019d refused to let the men in my life help me and I lacked a formal education, my life had always been a struggle. Well, I was tired of living hand to mouth, never knowing if I\u2019d have enough money to pay my bills at the end of the month. Mel hated me but I wasn\u2019t above using her. If I could just hear from Jerry, be assured he was safe, I could almost get excited about this seminar on Saturday night. Almost.</p><p>My phone rang just as Sienna shouted, \u201cScore!\u201d and got a confirmation number for our tickets.</p> <p>\u201cJerry, where the hell have you been?\u201d I know, not the most loving greeting, but he\u2019d left me worrying and waiting for hours.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Gloriana. I had a, um, blackout.\u201d He sounded tentative. Not like the Jerry I knew at all. \u201cI\u2019m afraid it might be a residual effect from my amnesia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God, no!\u201d Then I thought about it. \u201cWait. How can that be, Jerry? You were cured. It was a sorcerer\u2019s spell that took your memory and you got it all back thanks to another sorcerer. Were you with Mel when your blackout started?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so. When I finally got her on the phone last night, she insisted on a face-to-face. In her room at her hotel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Then I bet she put the moves on you. Do you remember that?\u201d I\u2019d lost all sympathy for him. Going to her hotel room when she snapped her fingers. Surely he could have figured out a better meeting place.</p> <p>\u201cI remember her opening the door. After that . . . nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was she wearing when she opened the door?\u201d Hell, did I have to drag every last detail out of him? Apparently.</p><p>\u201cGloriana, is that relevant? I\u2019m telling you I\u2019m losing my mind. If my amnesia is coming back again, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do. The last thing I recall is seeing her in her hotel room. Then I woke up in my car in the garage this evening right after sunset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God, Jerry.\u201d I could hear how upset he was so I didn\u2019t press him. But since he wasn\u2019t sharing, I just bet Mel had greeted him wearing the skimpiest thing Victoria\u2019s Secret carried in an extra large. \u201cDidn\u2019t Bart or Cait hear you come in last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently not. Look. I\u2019m weak and have to feed. I got your messages, knew you were worried so I called first thing. Now I\u2019ve got to go. I\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201d He ended the call abruptly.</p><p>I stared at the phone in my hand. Excuse me? He\u2019d sounded almost angry at the end of that call. What had I done? Amnesia? He wasn\u2019t angry at me, of course. Just scared. I didn\u2019t blame him. I looked up, hoping my mother would pop in for a visit. She\u2019d caused the last memory loss. I needed to know if she\u2019d had any part in this one. No answer. Of course not. She only came on her own schedule.</p> <p>I found Cait\u2019s number. She answered on the first ring.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d be hearing from you, Glory. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with Jerry.\u201d She sighed.</p><p>\u201cDoes Bart think he could be having some kind of flashback? Going through the amnesia thing again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me put him on. Jerry\u2019s gone out. You know my brother. He wants to find a mortal to feed from. Jerk. We can talk freely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlory, it\u2019s Bart. My first thought was that Jerry had been drugged. He\u2019s the one who assumes his amnesia was coming back. I explained about flashbacks. That it was possible he could have some brief episodes . . . That was all it took. Now he\u2019s convinced this is the start of something bad even though he\u2019s just missing a few hours.\u201d Bart swore. \u201cYou know how the amnesia made him feel. I couldn\u2019t reason with him. If he thinks he\u2019s losing his mind again, I don\u2019t know what he\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God.\u201d I closed my eyes. Mel must have done something to erase his memory of their time together. Did she have any idea how horrific that would be for him? It was like tapping into his worst fear. Maybe she did know and this was his punishment for trying to dump her.</p><p>\u201cI got him to give me a blood sample. I called Ian MacDonald and I\u2019m headed over to his place to use his lab and run a test. I\u2019m going to find out if Jerry was drugged. I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s what it must have been. There are several common substances that can erase a few hours. The date rape drug for one, though I\u2019d be surprised if it worked on a vampire. The woman probably drove him home herself then did her vanishing act. You did say she could do that, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought so, but now I\u2019m wondering if it wasn\u2019t more of a magic trick. She is mortal, you know. I\u2019ll just bet it was all smoke and mirrors. But then again I don\u2019t know a damned thing about voodoo.\u201d Date rape drug? I barely held on to my temper. If I showed up at Ms. Own-the-World\u2019s room, would she manage to dose me too? I was on my feet, pacing. I really needed to know more. Fury rode me hard and I had to stuff it back down and try to think things through, rationally. \u201cShe could have help, Bart. Backup to drive her away after she left him there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course. You\u2019re right. I looked at her Web site. She\u2019s bound to travel with a few flunkies, people to help her set up for her seminars and so on. Apparently she\u2019s quite charismatic. They\u2019d do whatever she told them. Even help her move an unconscious man.\u201d Bart was a scientist and always the voice of reason.</p><p>\u201cWhat gets me is that the bitch claims to love Jerry. If she drugged him and then . . .\u201d I had to stop and clear my throat. \u201cThanks, Bart. If you can prove she did such a horrible thing, then that should convince Jerry to stay away from her. Or to take some reinforcements the next time he sees her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s definitely an evil woman. I sure wouldn\u2019t want to be on her to-do list. Cait asks if you\u2019re coming over. She\u2019d like to see you, but doesn\u2019t want to leave until Jerry comes back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see her too. And to check on Jerry of course.\u201d I glanced at Rafe. \u201cBut I have a new vampire I\u2019m mentoring. Let me try to make some arrangements. I\u2019ll call Cait before I come if I can swing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. And I\u2019ll let you know what I find out at MacDonald\u2019s lab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Bart.\u201d I ended the call then met Rafe\u2019s interested gaze. \u201cThat bitch made Jerry forget half of last night. You have any idea how that made him feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike he\u2019s losing his mind?\u201d Rafe got serious. \u201cThat\u2019s cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you talking about the woman who\u2019s stalking Jerry?\u201d Sienna was interested.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I really didn\u2019t feel like sharing with her. She was now a problem I had to handle. \u201cYou wanted to do some more shopping tonight? Rafe, can you stay with her down there in the store while I go visit with Cait and check on Jerry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to be protecting you.\u201d He wasn\u2019t happy with the assignment.</p><p>\u201cPlease do this. It will really help me out. I promise I\u2019ll shift and jet straight over there. Once I\u2019m in Jerry\u2019s house, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be okay. What mortal would take on a vampire when she\u2019s awake and alert?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems like that mortal handled Blade last night.\u201d Rafe followed me when I got up and headed into my bedroom. Wardrobe. I wanted to look tough because it helped me feel that way. I pulled out black leather pants and a black satin blouse. My leather jacket was vintage and would help me blend into the night. Perfect.</p><p>\u201cGlory, the woman probably drugged Blade and he was at her mercy for hours he can\u2019t remember. You know I could hear your phone conversation, right?\u201d Rafe had Sienna on his heels.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a babysitter. If you want Rafe to be with you, take him.\u201d She pouted, then got distracted. \u201cCool jacket. I love the look. Got anything like that downstairs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do. Ask Megan to show you. There\u2019s one in the back room I haven\u2019t priced yet. If you like it, tell her to call me for a price check.\u201d I pulled open a drawer and collected clean underwear. Rafe raised an eyebrow at the sight of a black thong and pushup bra. So what? He\u2019d seen me in less. I headed for the bathroom but stopped to pin both of them with a stern look.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me a hard time about this. Sienna, you\u2019re too new to be left alone. Rafe, I need this favor. I can\u2019t have my new vamp around mortals unsupervised. I\u2019ll be fine. I hope I do run into Mel. I\u2019ll rip her throat out and we\u2019ll be done.\u201d I smiled, full fang, ignoring the fact that I hadn\u2019t been able to get near her the last time we\u2019d met. \u201cJerry\u2019s mistake is that he tried to reason with her. I won\u2019t bother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee, Glory. I\u2019ve never see you like this.\u201d Sienna shivered. \u201cYou\u2019d really kill her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she probably wouldn\u2019t. For all her tough talk, Glory\u2019s not like that. Which is what worries me. Let me call someone else to stick with Sienna so I can go with you, Blondie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t have time for that. And I can kill if I have to. Quit underestimating me, Rafe. I\u2019m into my powers now and I\u2019m not letting this woman get the best of me.\u201d I tempered my message with a smile. \u201cI know where you\u2019re coming from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, years of watching over you.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019ve changed. That\u2019s good. But don\u2019t get cocky. This voodoo thing is a new threat. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re up against.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d I touched his cheek. So dear. How did I get so lucky? To have this strong man care . . . \u201cI\u2019m on it. Flo\u2019s connecting me with a voodoo expert. I\u2019m going to find out what I need to know so I\u2019ll have even more weapons to work with. In the meantime . . .\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBe careful.\u201d He pulled me close. \u201cI mean it. Watch your back since I won\u2019t be there to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Rafe. I will.\u201d I gave him a brief hug then pushed him away gently. \u201cNow run along. Get shopping.\u201d I headed into the bathroom, refusing to listen to Sienna\u2019s questions or Rafe\u2019s answers about our relationship. I tried to tune into Mel\u2019s message. Yeah, I wanted to own the world and I was starting tonight. Taking charge of my universe and the people who were important to me. Too bad for Mel if she got in my way.</p><p>My phone rang as I was about to leave the blessedly empty apartment. Flo, coming through for me.</p> <p>\u201cAmica, I\u2019m worried. Are you sure you want to deal with a sacerdotessa vud\u00f9?\u201d Flo always lapsed into Italian when she was nervous. \u201cThose people scare me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax, Flo. The last time we used your contact\u2019s help, it worked. Remember when we got that demon out of me? We used love. It was great. Not scary at all.\u201d I smiled at the memory. \u201cOr at least not as scary as that demon was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right about that. Okay, I give. But be careful, my friend. This stuff is nothing to play with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Mel means business. You won\u2019t believe what she did to Jerry just last night.\u201d I told her, sinking down on the couch as I did. I hoped he was there when I got to his place. I wanted to hold him, comfort him. If Bart found a drug in his blood, surely that would make Jerry feel better about his memory loss. At least convince him that his amnesia wasn\u2019t returning.</p><p>\u201cThis is terribile! That strega cattiva! Call the woman in New Orleans. I hope she can help you get rid of this creature permanently.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks, pal.\u201d I glanced down at the paper where I\u2019d written the number. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know what happens.\u201d I hung up then dialed. The woman who answered the phone had a soft Creole accent that convinced me I had the right number.</p><p>\u201cIs this Madame\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not say my name. Who told you to call me, ch\u00e8re?\u201d</p><p>Hmm. Paranoid much? \u201cFlorence da Vinci. She used you a few months ago. For a sensitive problem with one of her friends. I\u2019m that friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I remember. I assume you have another problem, ch\u00e8re. Tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, um, there\u2019s a woman, a practitioner of voodoo, who is determined to trap a man and keep him. He\u2019s told her he wants to be with another woman, but she won\u2019t let him go. Now she\u2019s doing all kinds of things, including drugging him, I think, to make him stay with her. I\u2019m his girlfriend and she\u2019s threatened me. Wants me to give him up. What\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere is this woman from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiami.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer name?\u201d</p><p>Uh-oh. That question made me think there might be a history here. \u201cMelisandra Du Monde. Have you heard of her? Can you help me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChild, you are in trouble. Yes, you are. This is one powerful sorci\u00e8re. She uses Haitian magic. And she\u2019s dealing with the dark arts. I work with the light. The dark can bring much bad luck to the one who deals with it. A malheur, curse, on one of them . . . Well, I hope that is not what you have come to me for.\u201d She muttered something, an incantation, a prayer?</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s evil, Madame. I can smell it on her. I am way too familiar with the stench. I was possessed by a demon, have had dealings with Lucifer himself.\u201d I heard her exclaim. \u201cBut I triumphed over him. I\u2019m a good person. I swear it. Worthy of your help. And I\u2019ll pay. I have a credit card ready right here, if you have something to offer me, something that will help break her hold on my man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat will be very difficult, child. She is strong. And to face a powerful sorci\u00e8re . . . Are you sure you want to risk it? Is this man of yours really worth it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! He\u2019s the love of my life. You have no idea what we\u2019ve been through. I have to do this. Whatever it takes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen I will send you a book. It will have a recipe for a special potion. Follow it exactly with every ingredient as listed, no substitutions. It will be powerful, strong. You can use it to poison this woman\u2019s mind. It will taint her thoughts and send her screaming into the night, away from your man and your place. Does this sound like something you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d It actually sounded perfect. \u201cBut I\u2019ve tried to reach her, Madame. I am . . .\u201d I hesitated. Okay, go for broke. \u201cI\u2019m vampire. I thought if I could just jump her, tear out her throat, I could end this. But I can\u2019t get near her. She\u2019s shielded somehow.\u201d</p><p>I heard her muttering prayers this time, a Hail Mary? Not sure. Anyway there was a long silence. Finally she came back on the line, her voice hard but determined.</p><p>\u201cVampire. Of course. I should have guessed. Your friend was one also. There are so many of you. I try not to think about it. You will remember that I helped you. In case I need a favor? In the future?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sure. But what about this potion?\u201d I was getting desperate. If this woman didn\u2019t want to help a vampire, I was wasting my time.</p><p>\u201cYou must somehow lull her into trusting you. Better yet, get the man to do this. My potion will kill her love for him and make her go away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you throw it on her or does she have to drink it?\u201d I had visions of Mel dissolving like the Wicked Witch in Oz, only her expensive high heels left afterward. I\u2019d sell those in the shop of course. If I was going to own a chain of Vintage Vamp\u2019s shops someday, I couldn\u2019t miss a trick.</p><p>\u201cInstructions are in the book. As long as I know we are committed to helping each other . . .\u201d She paused.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes. I promise. A favor in the future. You have my word.\u201d Easy to promise when I doubted I\u2019d ever cross paths with a voodoo woman from New Orleans again.</p><p>\u201cFine. It\u2019s a deal. I\u2019ll even give you a discount.\u201d She quoted a price that still put a good dent in my credit limit. I read her my card number and expiration date then gave her my shipping information. She promised to overnight the package.</p><p>\u201cLet me know how this goes, ch\u00e8re. I\u2019ve heard of some of Du Monde\u2019s tricks. She gives all of us a bad name. It would not break my heart to hear that she has lost something this time.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. Good to know. \u201cCertainly, Madame. And thank you. I\u2019m sure you will mark the right page? This whole thing is new to me, I wouldn\u2019t want to screw it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Just don\u2019t try anything else in the book. In the wrong hands some of the other potions can be dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries, Madame. This is a one-shot deal. I\u2019ll be very careful. Thanks again.\u201d We ended the call.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re into voodoo now?\u201d Aggie smiled at me from the doorway. I can\u2019t believe I hadn\u2019t heard her come in.</p><p>\u201cNo, not really. I\u2019m just desperate enough to try anything. With Jerry being hassled by a voodoo priestess, I figured why not use the same weapons.\u201d I stuck my phone in my bra since I was going to shift to Jerry\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI get it. Good move. Where\u2019s Sienna? Surely you didn\u2019t let her go out on her own.\u201d Aggie dug into a pint of Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s downstairs shopping. Rafe\u2019s keeping an eye on her. Why? It\u2019s too soon for her to drink from you again if that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking. And what\u2019s with the ice cream? I thought you were dieting.\u201d I walked to the door.</p><p>\u201cFlo\u2019s coming over. She\u2019s decided to be my trainer. I have been dieting but I\u2019m not losing. That diet book I got from your shop sucks. I think it\u2019s out of date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it is. I sell vintage books, Aggie.\u201d I was in a hurry to leave and check on Jerry. \u201cWhy is Flo helping you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe feels sorry for me.\u201d Aggie looked me over. \u201cNice outfit. Going all black is slimming. Not that I can afford leather anything. Ian only lets me keep a few bucks a week for myself, the rest goes toward what I owe him. That pittance barely covers food and hair spray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you could buy the store brands instead of\u2014\u201d I opened the door.</p><p>\u201cBlasphemy!\u201d Aggie waved her spoon. \u201cYou can\u2019t taste this, but there\u2019s no comparison. Store brands don\u2019t have half the nuts, the cherries, the everything!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPah! Look at you, stuffing your face with calories.\u201d Flo practically flew into the room and snatched the carton out of Aggie\u2019s hands and dumped it into the kitchen garbage can.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Aggie actually tried to dig it out. \u201cDamn it, who put coffee grounds in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRafe. Flo, thanks for the phone number. Madame in New Orleans is coming through for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, but be careful. This is creepy stuff, no?\u201d She stalked over to where Aggie was leaning over the trash can and swatted her on the butt. \u201cGo! Put on workout clothes. You\u2019re running tonight. I have it all planned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, creepy.\u201d I stepped out of Aggie\u2019s way when she flung coffee grounds at both of us. Her language would do a rock star proud. No, I think even Ray might blush at one combo.</p><p>\u201cMy tennis shoes are from Goodwill. I doubt they can take much running. You know I\u2019m not good on dry land.\u201d Aggie glared at Flo.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a Siren now. You\u2019ll run or I drag you.\u201d Flo herself looked cute in a designer jogging suit and matching Nikes that had to be fresh out of a box.</p><p>\u201cAre you actually running too?\u201d I smiled at the idea.</p><p>\u201cMe? You must be kidding. No, I drive, Aggie runs alongside. I have the top down on the convertible. I\u2019ll shout words of encouragement like \u2018Move your lazy ass.\u2019\u201d Flo grinned. \u201cYou know how we hate that bitch.\u201d</p><p>I laughed and hugged Flo. \u201cGot to go. Have fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you headed?\u201d Flo got serious. \u201cBe careful. You said that woman is after you. She hasn\u2019t given up, has she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m shifting to Jerry\u2019s. I don\u2019t think Mel can fly. If she can, I\u2019ll take her down. Surely a vampire can take a voodoo woman in a fight.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWait. I want to hear about the voodoo.\u201d Aggie appeared dressed in loose gray jogging pants and a sweatshirt with the University of Texas logo on it that made her look twice as big as she really was. The shoes were neon pink and had obviously been donated because they matched nothing, certainly not the burnt orange UT logo.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you. After the run.\u201d Flo looked at me for permission. \u201cJust a little?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, why not? Ian\u2019s already getting an earful so why not Aggie too?\u201d I shrugged. \u201cWe\u2019re using Ian\u2019s lab to see if Jerry was drugged last night. Just keep the woman\u2019s name a secret for now. Okay, Flo?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGot it. Come on, Aggie. Move your butt.\u201d She dragged a griping Aggie toward the door and down the stairs. Then up again. Then down. By the third time, I just laughed and headed up toward the roof, Aggie\u2019s colorful curses ringing in my ears.</p><p>Once on the flat rooftop, I gazed up at the clear night sky. The stars were beautiful and it was cold and crisp. I took a deep breath and caught a whiff of something really bad. Dead. Worse than dead, coming from the alley. I glanced down and saw two figures lurking near the Dumpster in back of the shop. I had to check it out so I shifted into bird form and landed on the light pole above them.</p><p>The smell was almost unbearably strong this close, so I quit breathing. The two were dressed in business suits. The woman had on what had once been a high-quality pants outfit in navy. The blouse under the jacket had dirt stains. And a trip to the edge of the Dumpster showed me why. I could see her face or the ruin of it, and her matted hair. Zombie. The walking dead.</p><p>Her partner was a man, older, but dressed much as she was in what had been an expensive suit. His gray hair was cut close but grass stained. And I could see that his eyes were vacant and staring. What the hell? While I watched, Mel came out of the shadows at the end of the alley.</p><p>\u201cYou are to stay here and wait. If she comes out, take her down. Do you understand?\u201d She stared at first the woman, then the man.</p> <p>Their grunts must have satisfied her because she smiled and stalked off down the alley. I sat there, trying to decide whether to pursue her or just to fly to Jerry\u2019s. Zombies. How were they supposed to take me down? By killing me with their smell? A worker came out of the back door of Mugs and Muffins and one of the zombies moaned and started forward. The woman shrieked and dropped her garbage bag, running back inside.</p><p>Okay, this was going to be a problem and not just for me. Diana Marchand, the owner of Mugs and Muffins and a fellow vampire, peeked outside her back door and gagged.</p><p>\u201cWhat the ever lovin\u2019 hell is this? I\u2019m gonna have to do some serious mind erasin\u2019 tonight.\u201d She stared at the zombies, almost as if she was waiting for them to make a move, and one did start to shuffle forward again, raising its arms. \u201cYou\u2019d better not come after me or my people, you creeps. I\u2019ve got a blowtorch inside that will turn you into ashes before you can say, \u2018Hello, Lucifer.\u2019\u201d That stopped the man in his tracks. Diana looked around. \u201cGlory? Are you around, hon? You in trouble with demons and such again? \u2019Cause you\u2019re the only one I know hereabouts who gets into these kinds of jams.\u201d</p><p>I chirped, then sent her a mental message to look up. I waved my wings then sent a second message to meet me out front. She nodded and headed back inside. It didn\u2019t take me long to fly to the end of the alley and shift then walk to the front of our shops, which are next door to each other.</p><p>\u201cWhat the devil is goin\u2019 on, Glory?\u201d Diana was waiting for me, hands on her hips. \u201cI had to calm Louisa down then convince her she\u2019d seen a homeless couple doin\u2019 the nasty by the Dumpster.\u201d</p><p>I gave her a quick summary of my situation. \u201cI don\u2019t know how long they\u2019re going to be camped out there. I\u2019m the target, but it looks like they\u2019re too far gone to recognize me versus anyone else. You have any experience with, uh\u201d\u2014I glanced around, there were mortals nearby on the sidewalk\u2014\u201cthese things?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI hate to say it, but yes. I\u2019ve seen them a time or two. That\u2019s how I knew about the blowtorch. Guess you heard my threat. Actually, it\u2019s just a little acetylene thing I use to brown meringues, but they don\u2019t know that. Those creatures can\u2019t handle fire. It\u2019s the only sure way of taking them out.\u201d Diana grabbed my arm and steered me into my shop.</p><p>\u201cGood to know.\u201d I had visions of a zombie roast, the stench would be unbearable. I sure didn\u2019t want it behind my shop.</p><p>\u201cYou warn your people to stay out of that alley. I\u2019m pretty sure they won\u2019t know the difference between one woman and another. Either that or you and I can go torch those suckers right now. You got a broomstick and newspaper handy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, not on me.\u201d I had a new admiration for this delicate southern flower. \u201cBut I\u2019ll definitely give the staff a heads-up. Thanks, Diana.\u201d I smiled. \u201cSorry about this. I\u2019m working on ending the threat. Will let you know when it\u2019s safe to resume normal activities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake it fast. My store produces a lot of garbage. We need the Dumpster back there.\u201d She tapped her foot. \u201cThough they\u2019re after you, so I guess they won\u2019t be there during the day. Fine. All garbage will go out in daylight from now on. Tell your staff the same. The Dumpster\u2019s emptied in the mornings anyway.\u201d She smiled and gave me a hug. \u201cGood luck with this. Fight for your man. That\u2019s my motto.\u201d</p><p>We parted on those words, with me having to take a few minutes to warn Megan and my other clerk before I slipped over to the park across the street. There I was finally able to relax and shift again. I settled just feet from Jerry\u2019s walkway and changed into human form. Then I inhaled again. Was there evil on the wind? I heard footsteps and turned quickly, ready for fight or flight. What I saw didn\u2019t reassure me.</p><p>Seven</p><p>Jerry\u2019s face was grim. \u201cWhat are you doing out here alone? Don\u2019t you know how dangerous Mel can be?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJerry!\u201d I ran into his arms and held on to him. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>He pushed me away. \u201cLike shit. Come inside.\u201d He hustled me into the house then locked the door behind us. \u201cCait! Gloriana\u2019s here.\u201d He practically shoved me toward the kitchen. Cait sat at the bar with a glass of synthetic in front of her.</p><p>\u201cHi, Cait.\u201d I hurried over to give her a hug and a questioning look. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, if you can stand being around sourpuss here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Caitie.\u201d Jerry stomped into the living room and collapsed onto the leather couch. \u201cIf I\u2019m not all smiles, who can blame me? I think I\u2019m losing my mind. Not exactly cause for celebration.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed a bottle of synthetic out of the fridge and carried it into the living room. I was boycotting the couch, visions of Jer\u2019s daughter and a couple of guys playing a scene straight out of a \u201cShades\u201d novel there forever seared on my brain. So I sat in a chair across from Jerry and twisted off the cap. I took a swallow while Cait sat next to her brother and patted his knee.</p><p>\u201cThis is nothing like what happened in Scotland. You recognized Glory. You can drive a car, work the TV remote, hell, even troll the Internet looking up your symptoms. Does that sound like amnesia to you, Jeremiah?\u201d Cait exchanged glances with me.</p><p>\u201cYeah. When I can\u2019t remember hours last night.\u201d He stared at me. \u201cI know Bart is blaming a drug, but how\u2019d Mel manage to drug me? She never offers me a synthetic. And I sure as hell wasn\u2019t going to drink her blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Jer. This voodoo thing is way over my head.\u201d I caved and skirted his coffee table to claim a spot on his lap. He looked so lost. \u201cBut maybe her drug can be passed on by touch, like the substance on that knife you were stabbed with when you got amnesia in Scotland.\u201d Boy, did I hate bringing that up. My own mother had orchestrated the fiasco. But it was a viable option and couldn\u2019t be ignored.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, Gloriana.\u201d Jerry pulled me against him. \u201cAll right then. She grabbed my hand and pulled me into her room. Maybe that\u2019s when she transferred some kind of drug to my skin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t remember anything that happened after that?\u201d</p><p>Jerry dropped his head to the back of the sofa and stared up at the ceiling. \u201cNot a bloody thing.\u201d He sat up, his eyes hard. \u201cBut I know what was in my heart. I was there to tell her, Gloriana, to leave you the hell alone. That I loved you, only you. That I would never touch her again, no matter what she did. No matter what games she played.\u201d He ran his fingers through his hair. \u201cSometimes, when she\u2019d cut herself, the smell of her blood . . . You know how I am about mortal blood. But I made it clear. I was done. I wasn\u2019t drinking from her again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet she didn\u2019t take that well.\u201d Cait leaned forward. \u201cThis woman used to be your mistress, Jeremiah? How in hell did you get involved with a voodoo priestess in the first place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s also a motivational speaker, Caitie. When I met her, it wasn\u2019t obvious what else she was into. By the time I realized . . .\u201d He looked at me. \u201cNo excuses, but I think she did something. She\u2019s into spells. I had to have her blood. It became an addiction that I had to fight my way out of. It was one reason I moved to Austin. Not the main one. Gloriana drew me here of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d I jumped off of his lap, twisting away from his hold. I couldn\u2019t get the image out of my mind of Jerry with Mel. The intimacies they\u2019d shared. I fell back onto the chair, a gulf between us much wider than his chrome and glass coffee table. \u201cI wish you\u2019d never gone near her last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see how you hurt her?\u201d Cait slapped his thigh. \u201cDamn it, Jeremiah. Next time send a text message to the bitch. Obviously you can\u2019t get close to that Mel woman without complications.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. And I hope to God nothing happened during those hours I\u2019ve lost. But I was sure I could handle her last night, Gloriana. I certainly wasn\u2019t there to drink from her. Your blood is like home to me.\u201d Jerry\u2019s gaze burned as he stared at me, willing me to believe him. \u201cAfter centuries, it is the one source that means the most to me. Yet I can be near you, Gloriana, and not feel consumed by the need to feed from you. Not like it was with Mel.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood to know.\u201d If I slapped him, would he shut the hell up?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be mad, Glory, I heard a sweet compliment in there. Go on, Jeremiah.\u201d Cait rubbed his thigh where she\u2019d hit him pretty hard.</p><p>\u201cIt was a compliment. I\u2019m trying to explain how it was with Melisandra. When I was around her in Miami, my thirst was out of control. I could barely think about anything but having her blood. It had to be some kind of voodoo spell she\u2019d worked on me. Then, when we were close . . .\u201d He stared down at his boots. \u201cWell, I finally refused to fuck her again. I won\u2019t call it making love. She\u2019d always tried to turn my feeding into something sexual. Then she showed up here, wanting to start up again. I still had that unnatural thirst, but I managed to fight it. I guess her spell was wearing off.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t helping, Jerry.\u201d I dug my nails into the arms of the chair to keep from leaping across the room and wrapping my hands around his neck. Jerry was a wonderful, powerful lover. I had a picture now of his body against Mel\u2019s, his mouth on her . . . everywhere.</p><p>It was all I could do not to scream my pain, turn Jerry to stone, or toss his precious coffee table around the room until glass rained over us and the chrome was a twist of metal that I used to castrate him.</p><p>Cait obviously saw my evil smile at that idea and didn\u2019t like it. \u201cNow, now. Let\u2019s get this straight. Miami? I gather this was when you and Glory were taking a break?\u201d Cait was trying to soothe troubled waters. Obviously I looked pretty scary. \u201cCome on, Glory, you know you\u2019ve had other men when you two were apart. Cut him some slack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I have. Cut him slack and had other men.\u201d I finally threw off my jacket, leaned back and crossed my legs. I moved my arms so that the satin stretched over my breasts. Jerry took note of course. He liked me in satin. Tough shit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you all about them sometime, Caitie.\u201d I showed just the tip of my fangs and licked my lips to bug Jerry. \u201cBut we\u2019re done with our extracurricular activities now. Since this bitch has threatened me, we\u2019re supposed to be working together to get rid of her. What do you say, Jerry? Are you on board with that? Or has she got you under her spell again?\u201d The devil made me do it? Lame but possible.</p> <p>Jerry jumped up. \u201cGod damn it. I want her gone for good. That\u2019s the only reason I confronted her last night. I had my knives ready, fully prepared to kill her if I had to. You know that, Gloriana. How the hell things went so wrong . . .\u201d He ran his hands through his hair. \u201cThis memory thing is driving me mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe drugged you.\u201d Bart stood in the door from the kitchen. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind, but I kept that extra key and let myself in the back door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoctor.\u201d Jerry turned, clearly jumpy. \u201cSeriously? It was a drug. Not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot amnesia. Or at least not a recurrence of your old problem.\u201d Bart came into the room and kissed Cait on the cheek. \u201cGloriana, you look, um, dangerous tonight.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cThanks, Bart. That\u2019s exactly the look I was going for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA drug, you say. Any idea what kind?\u201d Jerry sat again, clearly relieved.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to discuss this now.\u201d Bart glanced at me.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, he does.\u201d I leaned forward. \u201cWas it the date rape drug? Did that voodoo vixen make Jerry have sex with her under the influence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Jerry shot to his feet again, one of his knives in his hand. \u201cNo one can force me to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to bet?\u201d Bart faced him. \u201cSorry, Jerry, but this drug makes you lose track of time, forget what happened, and does a number on your libido. While you were under its influence you had to have sex, were wild for it. It scrambles your brain, makes you lose touch with reality and of course wipes out your memory. While you were drugged you might have even imagined you were with another lover. Gloriana for example.\u201d Bart glanced at me. \u201cIf you said her name during the act, I\u2019m sure that would make the woman who drugged you hate Glory even more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, I need a shower.\u201d Jerry looked sick and staggered away, holding on to the banister when he headed up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cBart! Surely there\u2019s been a mistake.\u201d I felt like crying, my urge to talk tough vanishing. \u201cYou really think Jerry might have had sex with Mel and not realized who or what he was doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Bart sat in Jerry\u2019s spot and pulled Cait against him. \u201cIt\u2019s a hell of a drug. The bitch was clever. Ian and I are still trying to figure out how she got it into Jerry.\u201d He spouted some scientific jargon that went right over my head.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t want to drink from her. He wanted to kill her.\u201d I looked toward the stairs. I wanted to go to Jerry, console him somehow. But the idea that he\u2019d been intimate with that woman . . . My stomach churned.</p> <p>\u201cIan is all over it. He\u2019s fascinated by the voodoo connection. We\u2019re wondering if she mesmerized Jerry somehow, then made him drink a tainted blood. I don\u2019t know.\u201d Bart kissed the top of Cait\u2019s hair. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine how you feel, Glory. Knowing how she used Jerry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel, Glory?\u201d Cait\u2019s eyes filled with tears. \u201cAre you furious, hurt, ready to give up on my brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMad at Mel of course. But I can\u2019t abandon Jerry now. You heard him. He loves me. He was trying to protect me.\u201d I stood.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t blame yourself, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d Bart was on his feet. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure he could use your support right now. She made a fool of him. He\u2019s a proud Scot. We can\u2019t stand to be exploited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s the worst kind of humiliation. If I abandon Jerry now, she\u2019s won, hasn\u2019t she? No way in hell I\u2019m giving her my man.\u201d I stalked to the stairs and ran up them. When I got to Jerry\u2019s bedroom door I heard the shower running. Steam filled the bathroom but I could see Jerry through the glass shower doors. He was leaning against the tile, the hot water hitting his back, his head bowed, the picture of despair. I couldn\u2019t stand it. I stripped off my clothes, piling them on a chair in the bedroom before I slid the glass shower door open.</p><p>\u201cGloriana. How can you want to be with me now?\u201d He didn\u2019t reach for me. His eyes were bleak when he looked over his shoulder. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever feel clean again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let me help you.\u201d I grabbed the bar of soap and a washcloth. \u201cAnd of course I want to be with you. You\u2019re my lover, my best friend, Jerry.\u201d I smiled, kissed the spot under his right shoulder blade where he had an old scar, then ran the cloth over his broad back. \u201cRelax and let me take care of you. This is just another battle wound. It will heal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t deserve you.\u201d He turned to me, letting me soap his chest and his earth brown nipples as the water hit us both.</p><p>\u201cQuit talking, Jerry.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I just said that. How many times have I begged you to communicate, to share your feelings? But this moment is too important. I know you don\u2019t want to hear it, but you were Mel\u2019s victim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy God!\u201d Jerry\u2019s fists clenched.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, you should be livid, not up here feeling sorry for yourself. You\u2019re a virile, dynamic man who always makes my knees weak when you look at me, touch me.\u201d I gave his body a good checking out, my heart pounding as I saw how aroused he was. I ran that soapy washcloth down to scrub away any hint of voodoo priestess from his cock. I couldn\u2019t bear the thought that she\u2019d taken him inside her.</p><p>\u201cIf that woman were here now, I\u2019d break her neck with my bare hands.\u201d He pressed his fist against the tile wall and I could see his muscles jump. \u201cGloriana, you are the only woman I want. I hope you believe that.\u201d Jerry pulled me against him, our bodies slick and warm, easily finding our fit from years, no, centuries of practice.</p><p>\u201cProve it.\u201d I wrapped one leg around his, his hard cock nudging my inner thigh. \u201cYou\u2019re mine, Jeremiah. Take me with your eyes wide open. Know you\u2019re with me every minute. I don\u2019t need to cast some lame-ass spell to have you, do I?\u201d</p><p>He lifted me, wrapping both my legs around his waist as he pushed into me. He pressed my back against the tile, the warm water cascading around us. Feeling him inside me, I thought about what he\u2019d said. That my blood was home to him. Sweet words. And so very true for me as well.</p><p>\u201cDrink from me, Jerry. Get more of her poison out of your system. Drink until you can\u2019t remember what in hell she tasted like.\u201d</p><p>He growled and leaned forward, striking hard, his mouth rough at my jugular. I\u2019d stoked the anger simmering inside him. I wanted him in fighting form, not moping around like a wounded little boy. As he began his rhythm, coaxing an answering arousal in me with a clever finger, I had proof again that he was far from an inexperienced child. Jerry knew all my pleasure points and easily brought me to a screaming crest. Then he turned off the water and wrapped me in a towel.</p><p>On his bed, he stripped away the cover to stare down at me.</p><p>\u201cMy beauty. Let me love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave at it.\u201d I smiled and held out my arms. He fell into them, kissing me breathless before he rolled me over to lick a path from my shoulder blades to behind my knees with stops in between. I moaned when he pressed open my legs and pulled me up to kiss me intimately. His clever tongue made me call his name and beg him to come inside me again. He did, mounting me and riding me like he was the bull in a barnyard. He held my hips, his arms strong, his cock filling me and making me gasp as he surged into me time after time.</p><p>He said my name over and over, as if to reassure himself that he was with me, only me. I came apart, crying out his name, my heart demanding it. When he rolled me over to face him, I felt loose-limbed, replete.</p><p>\u201cDrink from me, Gloriana. Or are you afraid my blood might be infected by that creature?\u201d</p><p>My answer was to pull him down so I could sink my fangs into his vein. I tasted his blood and couldn\u2019t help the questions that haunted me. Did it taste different? Contaminated by Mel\u2019s evil? I didn\u2019t stop for long, his sweet familiarity reassuring. I drank until satisfied, licking the punctures closed with a sigh. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI love you, Jeremiah.\u201d I snuggled against his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you, Gloriana. Will you forgive me?\u201d He kissed my wet hair.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do? That bitch tricked you. Scared the hell out of you with her mind games. Let\u2019s forget it ever happened. We need to plan what we\u2019ll do next. I\u2019m going to try to use voodoo against her. I\u2019ve even got a book coming, with a recipe for a potion in it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou think you can cook up something to send her away?\u201d His voice was skeptical. \u201cSince when do you know voodoo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called an expert. Hang loose for a few days. Avoid her and let\u2019s wait for the book.\u201d I rubbed my hand over his chest, thinking about maybe going another round.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I left town? I still have that management problem in Miami and I thought I could do some investigating. Maybe I can find out more about Melisandra\u2019s background if I go back there and ask some questions. There might be something I could find out that could help us.\u201d Jerry had caught on to my idea of another round and slid his hand down my waist to the curve of my hip.</p><p>\u201cNot such a bad idea. I know Mel\u2019s stuck here all weekend because I saw an ad for her seminar in Austin Saturday night.\u201d I sat up. \u201cBut you\u2019ve known her for years, Jer. Didn\u2019t you have a pretty good idea of her background then? Meet some of her friends and family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d Jerry actually flushed. \u201cIt was a hot and heavy affair, Gloriana. We would meet at my hotel and, you know, get together. I have no idea if she has anyone important in her life. So this is worth a shot. Maybe I can find out if she has any vulnerabilities.\u201d</p> <p>I lifted his hand off my hip. Counted. Put it back. Okay, I couldn\u2019t be mad at him for an affair he\u2019d had when we\u2019d been apart. I\u2019d had my own, two actually. One when Jer and I had kind of been together. Anyway, it was an area we didn\u2019t need to explore right now. Instead we had naked bodies and healthy appetites that deserved exploration.</p><p>Shallow? Sure. Too much introspection can lead to short and sad relationships. That\u2019s one reason Jerry and I had lasted for centuries. We skirted deep issues, kept things light. It helped that he was usually all action and did very little talking. Now he proved he was still that way, rolling me under him and kissing me silent.</p><p>Finally, he pulled back and stared into my eyes. \u201cAre we okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose. Go to Miami. Get the dirt on Mel. Give me time to get that picture of you two being \u2018hot and heavy\u2019 out of my head. In the meantime, a demo of \u2018hot and heavy\u2019 here and now might help.\u201d I tugged on his hair, just to show him I was semiserious.</p><p>\u201cGloriana, she\u2019s mortal. There\u2019s no comparison. I was making do until I could be with the woman who takes \u2018hot and heavy\u2019 to a whole new level.\u201d He grinned and rolled until I sat astride him. \u201cLook at you, perfect, tasty and able to read my mind. What more could I ask for?\u201d</p><p>What more indeed? I leaned down to kiss him, shoving my old insecurities into the dark corner of my mind where they usually skulked. Perfect? Not hardly. But he didn\u2019t seem to mind my extra pounds or the way my ass dimpled. So I put a little extra enthusiasm into my lovemaking, to give him something to remember while he was in Miami. With luck, he might even find something useful there.</p> <p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>\u201cThis book came while you were at Jerry\u2019s.\u201d Aggie tossed it at me when I walked into the apartment after sunset the next night. \u201cPretty creepy stuff if you ask me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask you. What are you doing opening my mail?\u201d I frowned. It was an old book and Aggie\u2019s rough handling hadn\u2019t helped it any.</p><p>\u201cI thought it might be something I ordered online. A new diet book. I figured you owed me. Nice that you\u2019ve got a credit card on file at Amazon.\u201d Aggie groaned when she settled on the couch. \u201cFlo is killing me. I swear my thighs are paralyzed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo pain, no\u2014 Hey! How did you get my password anyway?\u201d I grabbed my laptop. Sure enough, it didn\u2019t take me long to see she\u2019d ordered a book and a couple of other things. Candy? How did that fit on her diet? I started to change my password.</p><p>\u201cPlease. You used your cat\u2019s name. Boogie. How easy was that?\u201d</p><p>I stopped typing. I\u2019d been about to change it to something equally easy, the name of my shop. I smiled and typed in Aggie\u2019s name. She\u2019d never guess that. I closed the computer.</p><p>\u201cStay off the Internet. Don\u2019t use my credit card. Are we clear?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDesperate times.\u201d Aggie frowned when Sienna came in wearing a vintage leather jacket. She\u2019d had Megan call for the price and had ended up buying it in the shop. \u201cLook. Everyone is shopping but me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodwill has leather jackets. Check it out.\u201d I smiled at Sienna. \u201cLooks good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I think so. Thanks for the great deal. I also bought some early Christmas presents but I can\u2019t imagine how I\u2019m going to handle giving them out.\u201d Sienna\u2019s eyes filled with tears. \u201cGuess I\u2019ll tell the family I have to be in the studio, recording, so I can\u2019t come home like I usually do. I\u2019ll just mail the gifts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis first Christmas it would probably be for the best.\u201d I patted the couch next to me. \u201cBy next year you\u2019ll be able to work out a way to be with them only at night and not arouse suspicion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell them I\u2019m a vampire? Seriously?\u201d Sienna blew her nose. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a promise I can keep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink about it. They\u2019d freak if they realized vampires really exist, wouldn\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, my baby sister would probably be cool with it. She\u2019s a big Twilight fan. But Mom and Dad?\u201d Sienna sniffed. \u201cNo, I can\u2019t imagine it. I\u2019m from a nice little town in Oklahoma. We have football on the weekends, you know high school games where everyone goes. I actually went back for homecoming last year and my first boyfriend got me a corsage. One of those big mums with streamers.\u201d She smiled, obviously remembering.</p><p>\u201cSounds . . . nice.\u201d I couldn\u2019t imagine it. It was like a movie I\u2019d seen once.</p><p>\u201cIt was nice, though I didn\u2019t realize it back then. Everything\u2019s so normal. I was always a freak in high school. So I ran away. Which broke my folks\u2019 hearts. We\u2019ve made our peace and they\u2019re over it now. Proud of me. But a vampire? No, can\u2019t see it.\u201d Sienna collapsed with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cYour sleep cycle would give you away. If you went home, how would you explain that you conk out when the sun comes up and simply can\u2019t wake up until sunset? It\u2019s just too bizarre for \u2018normal\u2019 people to deal with. Forget church on Sundays.\u201d Picturing Sienna\u2019s \u201cnormal\u201d family made me wistful. Not that I had a clue about how a real family acted. My only exposure had been TV reality shows and I hoped that wasn\u2019t how most families lived.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. The lunch after church is always a big deal. You should see the way my mom feeds me when I\u2019m home. Cooks all my favorites. And even if I stayed in a hotel, which my folks would never allow, it wouldn\u2019t work. My mom would be pounding on the door of the Holiday Inn before noon, wanting me to drive over to the mall in the next town to shop the after Christmas sales.\u201d Sienna wiped her wet cheeks. \u201cI love that shit. What did Ray do to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrewed you over, hon.\u201d Aggie had microwaved a diet dinner and was busy scarfing down spaghetti and meatballs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say.\u201d Sienna licked her lips, tears drying up fast. \u201cGod, whatever you\u2019re eating smells delicious.\u201d She turned to me. \u201cSeriously? We can\u2019t eat anything solid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a drug that allows eating temporarily. Ian MacDonald invented it and sells it. Costs the earth. It gave me some bad side effects, but most vampires can probably tolerate it. He also has a daylight drug. It\u2019ll give you enough time to watch a sunrise, but that\u2019s about it. I can\u2019t tell you how many thousands of dollars Ray\u2019s sunk into buying that stuff. He\u2019s addicted to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Once an addict, always an addict. He\u2019s just transferred the behavior to something else. Tell me about Ian MacDonald. Vampire?\u201d Sienna got up and took off her new jacket. The outfit underneath was pure Hollywood, the latest in skinny jeans and antique lace blouses. The blouse alone must have cost four figures.</p><p>\u201cYes, and a doctor. He\u2019s the one Aggie sued.\u201d I tried to keep a straight face. No one had been rooting for Aggie in that trial.</p><p>\u201cSeriously? What\u2019s the deal?\u201d Sienna sat across from Aggie again.</p><p>\u201cWe were in love. I was a Siren, that\u2019s a woman who lures men to her, takes their money then, um, finishes them off.\u201d Aggie waved her fork. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that. Glory was one too, back in the day. At least I was a good Siren. Had plenty of kills to my credit. Glory sucked. Was kicked out of the sisterhood for refusing to follow through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I lacked the killer instinct.\u201d I hung my head. \u201cI\u2019m so ashamed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet.\u201d Sienna winked at me. \u201cGo on. This is getting good. So what about MacDonald?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Ian and I were a couple. He\u2019s brilliant and hot. In bed . . . Well, don\u2019t get me started. So I fell hard. Decided he was worth leaving my day job for.\u201d Aggie sighed, obviously going through her personal highlight reel.</p><p>\u201cNot much of a job. Sounds like you were a hit woman.\u201d Sienna glanced at me. \u201cGlory was lucky to be kicked out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I\u2019d come to see there wasn\u2019t much future. No room for advancement. You get my drift. So I decided to give up the Siren life to become mortal.\u201d She looked down. \u201cI had a perfect body, perfect. Didn\u2019t I, Glory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. It\u2019s a Siren requirement. When I was kicked out, the Storm God, the man in charge of the Sirens, played a dirty trick on me, rearranging my parts so I wouldn\u2019t be perfect anymore.\u201d I slapped my hip. \u201cGo on, Aggie, finish this fascinating tale.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t mock me, Glory. It\u2019s a tragedy.\u201d Aggie chewed her last meatball. \u201cThese things are too damned skimpy. I\u2019m zapping another one.\u201d She got up. \u201cAnyway, I arranged to leave the Sirens, hit the dirt as a mortal and took Ian at his word that he\u2019d give me back my immortality by making me vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, the plot thickens. Ian promised to turn you? Yet here you are, still mortal and cleaning his toilets.\u201d Sienna laughed. \u201cThis is where the lawsuit came in. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I continued because Aggie was in the kitchen microwaving another dinner. \u201cWhen Ian smelled Aggie\u2019s mortal blood, he decided to just keep her as a blood slave. Use her kind of like you\u2019re doing but without the paycheck. He also lost interest in her physically. He\u2019d figured out, you see, that she\u2019d done the Siren song thing to make him fall in love with her. Once she lost her Siren magic, Ian lost the love.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe rat bastard wouldn\u2019t touch me.\u201d Aggie stood in the kitchen doorway, waiting for her dinner to finish. \u201cSo what if I used a little magic on him? We were hot together and I thought maybe we had the real deal.\u201d Big sigh. \u201cWell, you won\u2019t find me talking about love again, that\u2019s for sure. So I was stuck, mortal, and no lover. I took Ian to the local vampire court for breach of promise but those ass-hats are all about their own. Seems they don\u2019t like Sirens. Can you believe they ended up fining me a hundred thousand dollars for harming him?\u201d</p><p>Sienna glanced at me. \u201cCan you do that too, Glory? Make a man love you with music? Sounds like the coolest power ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was cool.\u201d Aggie frowned. \u201cGlory sings now like a frog in pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore. My mother gave me my song back.\u201d I almost laughed at the look on Aggie\u2019s face. Shock to put it mildly.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me? Hebe can do that?\u201d Aggie looked up like maybe she was ready to ask my mother to do her the same favor.</p> <p>\u201cApparently. But I wouldn\u2019t hold my breath waiting for her to do it for you, Aggie. You know Mom isn\u2019t going to give you anything without expecting a big payback.\u201d I saw her face fall. \u201cBesides I\u2019m not about to try to call a man to me. When Jerry thought that\u2019s how I\u2019d made him fall in love with me when we first met, he left me. Guys hate being manipulated. I\u2019m not risking another breakup over that Siren shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re nuts. You ought to try out your voice. At least see if it works. I\u2019ll bet you can do some kind of whammy with your vampire mojo to erase the love thing if it doesn\u2019t work out. What do you think?\u201d Aggie leaned forward. \u201cI mean that\u2019s a serious power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to hear you sing. Come on. Hit me with your best shot, Glory.\u201d Sienna\u2019s eyes gleamed.</p><p>\u201cNot now. What if you fell in love with me?\u201d I grinned. \u201cMaybe sometime when we\u2019re not in the middle of a crisis.\u201d I wasn\u2019t about to get into that now. \u201cHave you tried your own song, Aggie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. First thing. I figured a sugar daddy could be a perfect rescue from my situation. Oh, my voice is still great.\u201d Aggie preened for a moment, then sagged. \u201cBut men just look at me like I\u2019m nuts for breaking out in song at odd times. I can\u2019t call squat.\u201d She jumped when the microwave dinged. \u201cSo I\u2019m working off my debt to Ian the hard way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re so desperate for money.\u201d Sienna sat back but she kept giving me a speculative look. I felt sure this wasn\u2019t the end of her determination to hear me sing. She\u2019d produced her last album herself. Surely she didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be interested in a career in music. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have any savings? What about all those men you tricked out of their cash when you were a Siren?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, we weren\u2019t allowed to keep any of it. It\u2019s all up on Olympus, in the Siren treasure chest. Glory could get hold of part of it for me, if she\u2019d go up there. Play nice with her kinfolks.\u201d Aggie had her new dinner on a tray and she carried it back in, blowing on it to cool it off. \u201cChicken in peanut sauce. Not sure about this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, darling. A quick trip to Olympus with moi and Aggie would have enough cash to pay off Ian and get a place of her own. Even leave town. Where would you like to go, Aggie?\u201d My mother shimmered into view and sat on the other end of the couch.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been fond of the Amalfi Coast. I speak Italian, of course. And the water there is beautiful.\u201d Aggie grinned. \u201cLooking good, Hebe.\u201d</p><p>Sienna had jumped when Mom had popped into the picture. Now she stared openmouthed. Mom did look good. She wore the traditional Olympus garb tonight, which fit her figure perfectly. Her diamond pin at the shoulder gleamed and her blond hair was shining as it tumbled in waves down her back.</p><p>\u201cMother. I see you decided to join us. I called you the other night. Didn\u2019t you hear me?\u201d I kept a grim face. I wasn\u2019t about to take off for Olympus now.</p><p>\u201cOh, dear. No, I guess I didn\u2019t. What did you want?\u201d She looked innocent as she studied her silver nail polish.</p><p>\u201cNever mind. I had a question. It\u2019s been answered.\u201d I thought about asking for help with the Mel problem. No, like I\u2019d told Aggie, my mother didn\u2019t do favors without asking for serious payback and she didn\u2019t want me to be with Jerry at all. Of course if I told her I was in danger . . . I\u2019d wait and see if my recipe for a stay-away spell worked first. I\u2019d make Mom my contingency plan.</p><p>\u201cNice to know you actually wanted to see me for a change. Now about the fortune. Have you given it any thought? Look at poor Aggie, suffering because you\u2019re too selfish to take a little trip to get the money she needs.\u201d My mother glanced at Aggie shoveling chicken and some kind of noodles into her mouth. When a noodle landed on her robe, Aggie picked it up with her fingers and sucked it in. Mother wrinkled her nose. She didn\u2019t need to say \u201cdisgusting,\u201d we could see it on her face.</p> <p>\u201cHey, I am suffering,\u201d Aggie said after she swallowed. \u201cI can\u2019t wear rubber gloves for everything. I\u2019ve broken all my nails and can\u2019t afford a manicure. My body is completely ruined, with bulges everywhere. And I\u2019m getting older by the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could afford to move away if you had the money.\u201d Sienna obviously saw the most important benefit to me. \u201cBut are you nuts? You want to be a vampire? How about all this food you\u2019re scarfing down? I\u2019ve seen you with the Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s. You want to give that up on purpose?\u201d Her eyes filled. \u201cAnd give up daylight. I just don\u2019t get it. Why would anyone deliberately\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all about the immortality, hon. Mortals have ridiculously short lives. If I had money, the first thing I\u2019d do would be to pay a rogue vampire to turn me. Then I\u2019d be immortal again.\u201d Aggie slurped down another bite of the diet dinner. \u201cAfter I get back my perfect figure, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this about a rogue vampire? There are such things? People who turn you vampire for a paycheck?\u201d Sienna dragged her gaze from Aggie to me.</p><p>\u201cYes, and it\u2019s strictly against the council rules. You\u2019d be in a world of trouble if you got caught soliciting any more vampires to turn you, Aggie.\u201d I ignored her one-finger salute. \u201cMother, thanks for dropping by but I\u2019m in the middle of something important here. There\u2019s no chance I\u2019m going to Olympus with you anytime soon. You want to help Aggie, give her the Siren magic back.\u201d I smiled at Aggie, who looked like she was about to choke on her chicken.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Mom ignored Aggie\u2019s squeal of dismay. My mother picked up the book on the coffee table. \u201cWhat\u2019s this? Recipes for spells. Voodoo? Oh, my dear, this is so beneath you.\u201d She tossed it back on the table. \u201cIf you need to get rid of someone, say no more. I can make anyone vanish just like that.\u201d She snapped her fingers and Aggie was gone. Poof. The only thing left was the sweet tangy odor of peanut sauce and Aggie\u2019s discarded bunny slippers on the floor in front of the couch.</p><p>I took a moment to savor it. \u201cWhere\u2019d you put her, Mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d She snapped her fingers again and Aggie reappeared, cursing and shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the name of Zeus was that? Who sucked me into the black void? I was like, gone.\u201d Aggie narrowed her eyes on my mother and slapped her tray down on the coffee table. \u201cHebe, I thought we had an understanding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay no more.\u201d My mother waved her hand and Aggie was frozen in her spot.</p><p>\u201cUnderstanding? Now, this is interesting. Are you behind this whole thing? Aggie needing cash, staying here? I should have known you were in on this plot. It\u2019s all a ploy to get me to come to Olympus, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I jumped to my feet. My mother had made a fool of me. Aggie had made a fool of me. Did she really need money? No doubt about it. But I just bet my mom was slipping her some cash on the side. To get her to cooperate and make my life a misery, so I\u2019d be more open to taking that trip upstairs.</p><p>\u201cNow, calm down, Gloriana. I didn\u2019t orchestrate all of this. Some of it just fell into my lap. Aggie fell in love on her own. Made her foolish choice to leave the Sirens on her own. If I took advantage to press my little agenda . . . ? Well, who can blame me?\u201d Mother gestured, like she was practically a victim of circumstance.</p><p>\u201cI can blame you. Have fun waiting till eternity for me to go with you to meet Zeus. Grandpa Zeus. I wonder what he would think of your manipulations.\u201d I tapped my foot. If the woman had needed a door to make her exit, I would have flung it open.</p><p>\u201cDarling, don\u2019t be na\u00efve. Manipulation is how we survive up there. Zeus would be proud.\u201d Mother stood and tried to put her arm around me. I darted across the room, out of reach. Sienna stared at us both, wide-eyed. No need to freeze her, she wasn\u2019t about to move and miss a reality show worthy of prime time on the Syfy channel.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t go up there and that\u2019s final.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot even to save your man?\u201d Mother actually smiled.</p><p>Eight</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you mean?\u201d I stepped closer to her.</p> <p>\u201cYou think I haven\u2019t been following along? That I don\u2019t know what that voodoo person has been up to? I would never have let her hurt you, you know. Rest assured. But your Jeremiah? She can have him and good riddance.\u201d Mother flicked her fingers then just disappeared.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh, you are the most infuriating creature I have ever had the misfortune to meet!\u201d I kicked the wall, making a hole in it and scratching my good black boot. Damn it.</p><p>\u201cUh, Glory. What are you going to do about Aggie? I don\u2019t think she can move.\u201d Sienna had crept over to the couch and touched Aggie on the shoulder. Sure enough, the former Siren was still frozen.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should leave her like that. Serves her right, colluding with my mother.\u201d I sighed and trudged over to where Aggie sat, her fork halfway to her mouth. \u201cGet out of the way, Sienna. She\u2019s liable to come out swinging.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t thaw her yet.\u201d Sienna grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of fun, seeing her like this. Speechless.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, no, you didn\u2019t say that.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cShe can still hear us, just not move. Stay back. I\u2019ll handle this.\u201d I watched Sienna scurry to the bedroom and heard her lock the door. Famous rock star, scared of Aggie. I wasn\u2019t, but then I knew how to deal with backstabbing traitors. I touched Aggie and she did come out fists flying, noodles and chicken going everywhere.</p><p>\u201cStop it.\u201d I grabbed her hand. \u201cYou realize you\u2019re an inch away from being homeless?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell did I do?\u201d Aggie subsided quickly. \u201cSienna was mean to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s your paycheck. You can take it. Now listen up. You\u2019ll behave yourself from now on or I\u2019ll kick your butt out of here. Understand?\u201d I got right in her face, making sure she knew I meant every word. \u201cWorking with my mother? Not cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been nice to me when no one else around here gave a rat\u2019s ass. See? My feet were cold. She bought me these slippers.\u201d Aggie stuck out the bunnies. \u201cPassed me a few bucks at the grocery store too. I have to eat you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave you money for food.\u201d I let her go, refusing to feel guilty. When Aggie had complained I hadn\u2019t given her enough cash, I\u2019d ignored her, figuring she was just being greedy. Maybe prices had gone up since I\u2019d shopped for steaks and snacks for Valdez.</p> <p>\u201cThat pitiful amount you spotted me barely covered staples. You expect me to live on bread and water?\u201d Aggie sniffed. \u201cThose diet dinners don\u2019t come cheap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute.\u201d I wasn\u2019t buying into this guilt trip. I stomped over to the kitchen and pulled on the freezer door. \u201cStaples? Since when is a premium brand of ice cream a staple?\u201d I opened a cabinet. \u201cHah! There are three kinds of chips in here, even Cheetos.\u201d I whirled on her. Had someone told her I\u2019d had a thing once for those little orange puffs?</p><p>\u201cWhat? We didn\u2019t get junk food where I came from. Fancy banquets can be such a drag. I . . .\u201d Aggie shut up at what must have been a wild look in my eyes as I pulled open a drawer.</p><p>\u201cLook at all this candy! What did you do? Hit the Halloween treat aisle?\u201d My mouth watered. Chocolate.</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah. What if we get trick-or-treaters? That\u2019s all they were talking about at the grocery store.\u201d Aggie\u2019s food tray was shaking.</p><p>\u201cTrick-or-treaters?\u201d My voice rose. \u201cAre you freaking kidding me? Here? Where vampires live and there are double dead bolts on every door? You have to have a code to even get in this building, Aggie!\u201d I ran my hands over a particularly delicious-looking bar. Dark chocolate, the label said, with coconut and almonds. The reminders of my unfair life made me whirl around and land in front of Aggie again, my vamp powers in overdrive.</p><p>\u201cYou took money from my mother and now you\u2019re torturing me.\u201d I thumped her on the shoulder with my fist. \u201cTraitor! Ingrate! I brought you into my home. Gave you a roof over your head when you had nowhere else to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOw! That hurt!\u201d Aggie cringed and rubbed her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Glory. I didn\u2019t think about you when I bought that stuff, I swear. Just me. I wanted it. Even though it\u2019s not on my diet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s sure as hell not.\u201d I could smell that chocolate from where I stood, inches from Aggie. I jerked her stupid diet dinner from her hand and practically threw it on the coffee table. What a farce. Expensive diet dinners followed by who knew how many trips to the kitchen for snacks. No wonder she wasn\u2019t losing weight. I imagined Aggie enjoying a bag of Cheetos and snarled.</p><p>\u201cGlory, calm down!\u201d Aggie scooted to the other end of the couch and looked like she wanted to make a run for her bedroom.</p><p>\u201cStay put, we aren\u2019t done.\u201d I blocked her escape route.</p><p>She shook and held a hand to her throat. \u201cAre you going to kill me? Over my food choices?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I did kill you, it would be because you plotted against me, with my mother.\u201d I frowned down at the scratch on my boot. \u201cDid she tell you what to buy at the store? She\u2019s probably trying to make me regret being a vampire. This would be just like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I got a craving. Hebe has the power . . .\u201d Aggie kept staring at me. \u201cShit, look at your big honkin\u2019 fangs. I get it. I\u2019m just a weak mortal now. At your mercy.\u201d A tear ran down her cheek. \u201cOkay, I was wrong. I shouldn\u2019t have listened to Hebe. But she was the one who gave me a chance to be with Ian and she freed me from Achelous.\u201d Big tears were rolling now, dripping off the end of her chin. \u201cCome on, Glory. Surely you can relate. I had to get away from that controlling son of a bitch. And you don\u2019t take a favor from a powerful goddess without expecting to pay her back.\u201d</p><p>Well, well. For once, Aggie did look scared. I realized her mortal blood had taken over in the delicious smell contest and my fangs were fully extended. I wasn\u2019t about to do something stupid and had never been a killer anyway. Obviously Aggie was as much a victim of my mother\u2019s plotting as I was.</p><p>\u201cAggie, you drive me nuts.\u201d I fell back into a chair and took a steadying breath. \u201cI thought you had a goal. To get into Flo\u2019s size-six cast-offs.\u201d</p><p>Aggie wouldn\u2019t look at me as she wiped tears off her face. \u201cI do. I\u2019m desperate to lose weight. But it\u2019s so hard.\u201d</p><p>I could see she meant it. \u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry. Look. You\u2019re a good size right now. Own it, work it and quit obsessing about the stupid diet. I\u2019ll give you a few more things from the shop if you\u2019ll stop worrying about the size number in the label and concentrate on being proud of yourself now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d Aggie\u2019s wail was straight from her heart. \u201cGlory, size matters. I want to hook up with a guy who\u2019ll take care of me. When I was a Siren, the Storm God handled everything. If I\u2019m little and cute, I\u2019ll stand a better chance of snagging a rich man.\u201d She sniffled. \u201cLook at you, vampire, able to do stuff like freeze people, shape-shift, scare me shitless. I\u2019m just an ordinary human now. You have no idea how helpless that makes me feel.\u201d</p><p>I gritted my teeth. Okay, I got it. Before I\u2019d decided to use my powers, I\u2019d acted like her for years, no, centuries. But I\u2019d grown past that now. And there were plenty of mortals who managed to take charge of their lives and they didn\u2019t have power one.</p><p>If my own powers were suddenly stripped away, would I be so sure I could handle things on my own? I did a gut check. Hell, yes. I could take care of myself now. My dependent days were over.</p><p>I studied Aggie. She\u2019d been a force to be reckoned with for centuries. I had a feeling that pushy broad was still in there somewhere.</p><p>\u201cGet a grip, Aggie. I\u2019ve never known a woman more capable of handling herself than you. Quit looking for someone else to take care of you and look inside. You have what it takes to make it on your own. You\u2019re smart, beautiful\u2014not that that matters\u2014and talented. You have skills, lady, you just need to discover them.\u201d</p><p>Aggie\u2019s mouth quivered. \u201cSkills? I get it. You want me to turn tricks? Those are the only skills I\u2019ve got and you know it. Sex. Sirens are famous for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I jumped up and gave her shoulders a shake. \u201cStop it. Sex isn\u2019t all you know. I\u2019m thinking you must be pretty smart and I know you\u2019re manipulative. There\u2019s got to be some way to make that work for you. You can still sing too, can\u2019t you? Even though it isn\u2019t magical, it\u2019s a good skill.\u201d</p><p>Aggie firmed her mouth and I could see the wheels turning. \u201cHey, maybe you\u2019re right, Glory. I know I\u2019m sick of my own whining. Part of it was to bug you. Hebe had me do it.\u201d She brushed aside my hands and slapped her fork down on her unfinished dinner on the coffee table. \u201cOf course I have a line of fancy patter I can use when I need to. I could even wrap the Storm God around my finger from time to time. Ian admitted I was smart too. Yes, my voice is golden. Maybe I could get a singing gig. We\u2019re here on Sixth Street where there are a dozen clubs open every night needing entertainment.\u201d She took a deep breath, her robe rising and reminding me she had a good figure that an audience would appreciate.</p><p>\u201cThere you go. So you\u2019re not powerless.\u201d I could easily imagine her in one of the clubs, tossing her blond hair as she sang.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, I\u2019m going to cut my hours at that bastard Ian\u2019s house and start looking for something else. A way to make money on my own.\u201d She grinned and winked.</p><p>\u201cCut your hours? Won\u2019t his men tell on you?\u201d I knew she was supposed to work a certain number a day, according to their agreement.</p><p>\u201cNaw. His day guards are putty in my hands. I think they feel kind of sorry for me.\u201d Aggie got up and stretched.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sound so surprised. Like you said, I can be manipulative when I need to.\u201d Aggie polished her nails on her robe and fluttered her eyelashes. \u201cThey even let me watch my shows, the Real Housewives reruns, every afternoon after lunch. It\u2019s not like Ian\u2019s house is really dirty, and he won\u2019t let me touch his lab.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I had a creepy feeling that Aggie\u2019s manipulation used more than charm to get the shape-shifters who watched Ian during his death sleep to give her breaks. I started to read her mind then decided the fewer details I knew the less grossed out I\u2019d be.</p><p>\u201cOkay then. Maybe you\u2019ll find a second job that you can do in the evenings.\u201d I was for anything that would get her out of the house when I was awake.</p><p>\u201cFirst, though, I\u2019ll do a little shopping downstairs tonight. Thanks, Glory. I figured once your mom outted me I\u2019d be toast here.\u201d She stopped in the hall doorway. \u201cI\u2019m in the mood for a long soak. I hope you aren\u2019t planning to use the bathroom anytime soon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, go ahead.\u201d Bathing. That reminded me. \u201cDon\u2019t use the alley. I saw a, um, rat out there. Huge.\u201d I had to give her the warning before she disappeared into the bathroom. Sure, I\u2019d like her out of here, but I wasn\u2019t desperate enough to make her a zombie sacrifice.</p><p>I stared down at her dirty dinner tray, then thought about what she\u2019d said. What was wrong with me? Aggie should have been toast. Instead I was giving her good advice. I could almost hear my mother\u2019s laughter. And what about Mom\u2019s conviction that she\u2019d never let Mel hurt me? Really? What if the witch came after me when Mom was \u201cbusy\u201d? She seemed able to tune in and out of my life at will.</p><p>I picked up the book Madame had sent me and glanced at the page marked with a slip of paper. I was going ahead with this plan. Too bad there were enough ingredients to create Frankenstein\u2019s monster. And how on earth was I going to find all this stuff? Maybe my mother was right and I had no business messing with voodoo. When someone knocked on the apartment door, I jumped and ran to the peephole, careful to look before I threw the lock.</p><p>\u201cRafe. I wondered where you were. I thought you were supposed to stay here during the day.\u201d I opened the door.</p><p>\u201cI was here. When I got your text that you were with Blade, I slept on the couch, but left as soon as Sienna woke up. I had a few things to do at the club before I could come tonight. Plus I wanted to go home and shower, pick up a few things.\u201d He came in with a duffel bag. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d He sniffed the air. \u201cWhat\u2019s that smell?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA combo of spaghetti and peanut sauce. Aggie\u2019s diet dinners.\u201d I locked the door behind him. \u201cI need to go down to the shop tonight. Are you sure you can spare the time away from the club?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. But if you can see your way clear to go over to N-V for an hour or two later, it would help me out.\u201d He rummaged in the kitchen and came out with the carton of ice cream. \u201cIs this part of Aggie\u2019s diet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s struggling. Do her a favor and finish that off. There are Cheetos and candy in there too.\u201d I sat on the couch. \u201cI can go to the club. First I want to wait for Jerry to come by. He\u2019s leaving tonight for Miami, to do some checking on the voodoo woman. He had a bad encounter with her last night and we decided it might be best for him to leave town for a while.\u201d I told Rafe about the drug, leaving out the date rape. I knew Jerry wouldn\u2019t appreciate Rafe knowing that detail.</p><p>\u201cNo way. She made him forget the whole night? That\u2019s harsh.\u201d Rafe spooned up chocolate ice cream. \u201cYeah, leaving town is a good idea. We know Mel\u2019s stuck here and we can scope her out at that seminar. Did that book come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but look at these ingredients.\u201d I picked up the book and opened the page. \u201cNew leaves from a baobob tree. Three legs of a Peruvian cave whip scorpion. A feather from a pileated woodpecker.\u201d I moaned. \u201cI could go on and on. It could take forever even if I could find a place to order this stuff from on the Internet and not be put on a terrorist watch list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sounds pretty dicey. Let me see that.\u201d Rafe scraped the last bite out of the pint and walked into the kitchen to dump the empty carton into the garbage can. When I heard him rinsing off his spoon, I had to smile. He did make a nice roommate. Aggie\u2019s dirty dish still sat in the middle of the coffee table.</p> <p>\u201cDo I hear Rafe?\u201d Sienna came out of the bedroom. \u201cHey, glad you got here. Are we going to N-V? I got a text from Ray. We need to rehearse tonight. I don\u2019t want to go to his house so I thought we could practice in that soundproof room you\u2019ve got above the club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to stick close to Glory. She needs to go to the shop.\u201d Rafe was leafing through the voodoo spell book. \u201cGlo, can we drop Sienna off at the club first, then do our thing at your shop? You trust her alone with Ray and the band?\u201d</p><p>I was about to answer when there was another knock on the door. What was this? Didn\u2019t anyone need the code downstairs? What had happened to ringing for entrance from the street? I inhaled though and sensed Jerry on the other side of the door. Of course. He had the code and a key. He\u2019d knocked as a courtesy. I flung open the door.</p><p>Jerry dragged me into his arms for a long kiss then looked over my shoulder. \u201cValdez.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not surprised he\u2019s here?\u201d I eased out of Jerry\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jerry smiled and kept his hand on my waist. \u201cI called him and asked him to meet me here. Did you really think I could leave town with you unprotected?\u201d</p><p>I glanced from Rafe to Jerry and back again. This was huge, Jerry asking Rafe for help. \u201cThat\u2019s nice. I guess Rafe told you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I\u2019d be happy to arrange guard duty for you, Glory. But that I don\u2019t want to delegate it. Blade understood. That you and I have a special bond.\u201d Rafe relaxed into a chair. \u201cSo what are your plans, Blade? What do you think you can accomplish with this trip?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a line on Mel\u2019s sister. She\u2019s in Miami and may have something to tell me that could help with this situation. Mel\u2019s business is very important to her. If I can get something that could endanger her reputation publicly, ruin her business, I think that will cool her off toward me. Problem is, it has to be something that keeps my name out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I get that.\u201d Rafe smiled. \u201cGood plan. Drag a skeleton out of the lady\u2019s closet. Blackmail her. She should hate you for it and back off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I have to, I\u2019ll drag her sister back here. I think she may be the key to getting this done.\u201d Jerry pulled me down to the couch beside him then finally noticed my guest. \u201cSienna. How are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Sienna smiled nervously. \u201cOkay, I guess. We were just trying to figure out the night\u2019s schedule. I have to practice, Glory needs to go to her shop. It\u2019s complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. That\u2019s the vampire life.\u201d Jerry leaned back, his arm around me. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t get any easier. Valdez, sounds like you need backup. Can\u2019t you bring in another shifter, someone to help with the ladies?\u201d</p><p>Valdez frowned. \u201cSure, I guess so. Let me get on it.\u201d He got up, pulled out his cell and strode to the kitchen. We heard him talking to someone.</p><p>\u201cI do need my own bodyguard. I usually travel with one but had done without while I was staying with Ray. He has a whole crew.\u201d Sienna stood in the hall doorway. \u201cI\u2019m going to finish getting ready if I can blast Aggie out of the bathtub. I dread seeing Ray again. I\u2019m still so mad at him.\u201d She turned and disappeared into the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a full house, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Jerry sniffed. \u201cAggie in the tub, she said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. She\u2019s still hung up on water. It\u2019s a Siren thing.\u201d I told him about our latest fight, including my mother\u2019s manipulation.</p><p>\u201cI hate to say it, but you might be better off in Olympus right now.\u201d Jerry stared into my eyes. \u201cMel is capable of anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m not going to Olympus. Once my mother gets me there, I have a feeling I\u2019d have a serious problem getting back.\u201d I sighed and snuggled up against him. I still hadn\u2019t told Jerry about the zombies. Since he hadn\u2019t mentioned them, I had to assume he\u2019d shifted here and come in through the roof. Still, I was surprised he hadn\u2019t smelled them when he\u2019d landed. \u201cI hate for you to leave, Jerry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for the best. Now, if you\u2019re sure you won\u2019t go, then I had a couple of ideas to keep you safer while I\u2019m gone. Lily\u2019s apartment is ready upstairs. Her new furniture was delivered today.\u201d Jerry pulled a key out of his pocket. \u201cHere\u2019s the key. I told her she can\u2019t move in yet. You and Valdez can stay there until I get back. Mel won\u2019t know where you are and you\u2019ll have some peace and quiet. How does that sound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike heaven.\u201d I snatched the key. \u201cThanks, Jerry.\u201d I kissed him. \u201cLily won\u2019t get mad?\u201d I knew his daughter had been counting the nights until she could have her own apartment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m paying the rent, so she can wait a few days.\u201d Jerry kissed me again. \u201cI explained the situation. She understood.\u201d He pulled me to my feet when Rafe walked into the room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a man meeting us down in the shop in twenty minutes. He\u2019ll stick with Sienna so I can take care of Glory. That work for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfect.\u201d I glanced at Jerry. \u201cYou said you had a couple of ideas. What\u2019s the other one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you upstairs.\u201d He stared at Rafe. \u201cWe\u2019re going to apartment three B.\u201d He tossed Rafe a key. \u201cMeet us there in five minutes, Valdez. We need some privacy.\u201d Jerry pulled me to the door.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t take orders from you, Blade.\u201d Rafe didn\u2019t look happy.</p><p>\u201cDid you miss the part where I said I\u2019d pay you?\u201d Jerry wasn\u2019t cracking a smile. \u201cOr is this a favor to Glory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a favor. You don\u2019t owe me jack.\u201d Rafe stepped closer.</p><p>\u201cCalm down, both of you. I appreciate the favor, Rafe. Jerry, you don\u2019t need to pay him but thanks for offering. Rafe is doing this out of friendship. I\u2019d say shake hands but I know better. Now let\u2019s go, Jer.\u201d I pulled Jerry up the stairs. We stopped at the third floor and he pointed out Lily\u2019s new apartment. Privacy. I wasn\u2019t fighting it. I waited until he\u2019d unlocked the door of 3B and we were inside the freshly painted apartment before I asked the burning question. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay, Jer. What else did you do to keep me safer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called Mel. Told her you broke it off with me. That I\u2019d come home reeking of sex with her and you didn\u2019t buy my memory-loss story.\u201d He stared down at me. \u201cI\u2019m lucky it didn\u2019t go that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuck had nothing to do with it.\u201d I slipped my arms around his waist. \u201cWhy did you tell her that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo get her off your back. I figured she would leave you alone if she thought we weren\u2019t together anymore.\u201d He pulled me tight against him. \u201cTrouble is though she said she wasn\u2019t buying it. I cursed her. Told her she\u2019d ruined my life with her shit and that I never wanted to see her again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet that didn\u2019t go over well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the truth. Then I added that you were moving on to someone without baggage. Told her I was taking a few days in Miami to fix the mess she\u2019d made there in my hotel.\u201d He rested his chin on my hair. \u201cI hope that\u2019ll give her something to think about. That she\u2019ll leave you alone. She\u2019s got that seminar you mentioned right here in town so she can\u2019t follow me to Miami.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a good idea.\u201d I rubbed his back. \u201cI hate the fact that you goaded her, Jer. But if she believed you, I shouldn\u2019t be on her radar at all.\u201d I kissed his skin where his collar was open over his throat. I could see his pulse and kissed my way to it. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me, I\u2019ll be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one more thing you can do, Gloriana, while I\u2019m gone. It should help keep you safe.\u201d He pushed me away and looked into my eyes. \u201cI hate this like hell, but it\u2019s the best way to go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I didn\u2019t like the way he was staring at me, so solemn. His mind was blocked too, though I really shouldn\u2019t have tried to probe it. I could have pushed through the block, but didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou and Valdez. I want you to act like a couple while I\u2019m gone. Throw Mel off. Show her that you really have moved on.\u201d He smiled but it was a sad fake. \u201cLike you did when you pretended to be with Caine. Only I don\u2019t think you have to flash a big engagement ring this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt she\u2019d buy that. It\u2019s too soon, Jerry.\u201d I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cYou know Valdez won\u2019t mind the charade. Hell, he usually can\u2019t keep his hands off you anyway.\u201d Jerry rubbed my shoulders, pulling me close again. \u201cOf course I hate like hell to imagine you two together. But there\u2019s no better way to convince her that you and I are history.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRafe\u2019s even willing to go back to dog form for me, Jer. To fool Mel into making a move during the day. That\u2019s how loyal he is.\u201d I wanted Jerry to know how much this would cost Rafe. \u201cTo pretend to be lovers again . . . That\u2019s really not fair to him. He\u2019d do it, no doubt about it. But it\u2019s a cruel joke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can take it, Glory. I have my own woman now. And Blade\u2019s right. It\u2019s a great way to keep Mel from making another move on you.\u201d Rafe stood in the doorway. I guess we\u2019d left the door ajar. \u201cYou did say five minutes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou heard.\u201d I knew my face was red. \u201cSorry. Jerry had this crazy idea that Mel would back off if you and I were having a wild rebound affair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorks for me.\u201d Rafe grinned.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to enjoy it too much, Valdez. Besides, I know Gloriana is committed to me. I trust her completely.\u201d Jerry had me snug against his side.</p><p>\u201cWell, then.\u201d I was actually at a loss for words. I\u2019d waited literally centuries to hear Jerry say those words. \u201cSo that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do. Play the game and hope Mel buys it.\u201d I walked Jerry to the stairs. \u201cWe\u2019re going to the roof, Rafe. I\u2019ll be back in a few.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t come looking for her.\u201d Jerry growled as he followed me up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d Rafe was grinning as he shut the apartment door.</p><p>\u201cTake care of yourself. Don\u2019t fly too long.\u201d Up on the roof I held on to Jerry, wishing he didn\u2019t have to go. It hadn\u2019t been that long ago that he\u2019d been drugged.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019ll lay over in one of my safe houses. You know I\u2019ve made this trip many times. I have the route well laid out.\u201d He smiled and brushed my hair back over my shoulders. \u201cTake care. Don\u2019t leave Valdez\u2019s side. I don\u2019t particularly like the bastard but he\u2019s good at what he does. If he gets carried away with this fake relationship, you know what to do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can turn him to stone in a heartbeat. But he won\u2019t push things. He takes good care of me.\u201d I pulled Jerry\u2019s head down for a final kiss. \u201cI love you. Hurry home.\u201d I watched as he shifted into a black bird and took off. He blended into the night sky, his final squawk his own good-bye to me.</p><p>I looked over the ledge down to the alley. No sign of the zombies tonight. Did that mean Mel had believed Jerry\u2019s tale of our breakup? It was a good sign anyway. I was smiling when I found Rafe setting his duffel bag in front of Lily\u2019s door.</p><p>\u201cNice digs. He doesn\u2019t stint when it comes to his daughter, does he?\u201d Rafe opened the door and stepped inside. \u201cTwo bedrooms. What does she need with two bedrooms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know but I\u2019d love to foist Aggie on her. I need a plan for just that.\u201d I wandered into the kitchen and opened the refrigerator. Fully stocked with premium synthetic blood. I helped myself to my favorite flavor, AB negative. What a treat.</p><p>\u201cDo the two women get along?\u201d Rafe looked in vain for human snack food in the empty cupboards. \u201cWe need to go shopping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes anyone get along with Aggie? Do her a favor and go shopping in my kitchen.\u201d I sat on the black and white print couch. The living room was done in a contemporary style. Black and white with touches of red. There was a fluffy white flokati rug on the refinished hardwood floor. I loved it, even though I\u2019d always been more into antiques and the retro look. There was something about everything being brand-new that appealed to me. A fresh start. What a concept.</p><p>\u201cActually though, the two are pretty friendly. Two contrary females. I\u2019ve seen them with their heads together more than once.\u201d I drank my blood, sighing with pleasure. \u201cMake a shopping list, Rafe. We\u2019ll hit the grocery store too. Aggie made me realize I haven\u2019t been giving her enough food money. I need to see what things cost now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let her guilt-trip you, Glory. The woman\u2019s taking advantage of you all the way around.\u201d Rafe stood by the door. \u201cWe need to go. I\u2019ve got to meet that new guard, bring him up to speed on Sienna\u2019s needs and take care of some things. Remember?\u201d</p><p>I got up reluctantly. Break over. I drained the bottle, rinsed it out and set it aside. We\u2019d start a recycle bin up here. Lily should learn to do that. I followed Rafe out and locked the door. I had a serious case of apartment envy. My feet dragged as I headed downstairs to my noisy, cramped and tired old place.</p><p>When we got to my door, I heard singing. A duet. Somehow I had a feeling this was not going to turn out well.</p><p>Nine</p><p>When I opened the door, Sienna and Aggie glanced my way but didn\u2019t stop singing. Sienna was playing her guitar while Aggie tapped out a beat on my coffee table. It was a familiar tune, a hit that had been playing on the radio recently.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t believe it. A happy sing-along? Obviously Aggie had decided to use Sienna to launch a singing career. And Sienna? She grinned and winked when Aggie took a solo turn. Hmm. So maybe Sienna thought she could stick it to Ray if she brought Aggie along to their rehearsal. She must have heard that he hated the former Siren. Aggie had tortured Ray and me when we\u2019d first met. She\u2019d almost sacrificed us to save her own skin when she\u2019d been in trouble with Circe, a goddess who hated vampires on general principle. I\u2019d sort of moved past it. Ray never had, nursing an urge for revenge almost to the point of obsession. And what Ray despised, Sienna now loved.</p><p>The song ended and they both laughed, obviously pleased with their sound. Who wouldn\u2019t be? They both had tremendous voices, clear and powerful. The harmony had been spot-on.</p><p>Rafe clapped. \u201cAmazing. You two sounded great together. What brought that on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a little experiment. Aggie mentioned she used to sing for a living. I wanted to hear her. Some voice, huh?\u201d Sienna tapped Aggie\u2019s knee. \u201cThose men didn\u2019t stand a chance.\u201d</p><p>I just stared. Did Sienna not get that Aggie had used her song to bring men to their deaths? I thought we\u2019d made it pretty clear earlier. I guess the rocker didn\u2019t care. Her recent experience with Ray must have made her so down on men that Aggie\u2019s taking out over a million men had seemed like a public service.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Sin. Coming from you, that\u2019s quite a compliment.\u201d Aggie managed to sound humble. \u201cYou really think I have a shot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. We\u2019re going to make it happen.\u201d Sienna handed her guitar to Rafe when he stuck out his hand. \u201cYou\u2019re going to the club with me tonight, Aggie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be interesting.\u201d Rafe grinned. \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShop first. I know Glory needs to check in down there and Aggie should have some decent clothes for her new singing career. Then I\u2019m taking her to my practice with Ray. I think Aggie would make a great backup singer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBackup?\u201d Aggie started to argue but stopped when she saw my frown. \u201cWell, I guess it\u2019s a good place to start.\u201d She grabbed her coat. \u201cI\u2019m used to being a solo act, Sin. I was hoping to start checking out places on Sixth Street, trying for my own singing job. A night gig of course. I can\u2019t give up my day job at Ian\u2019s. Yet.\u201d She wrinkled her nose. \u201cHe won a judgment against me. If I default, the vamp council will lock me up in a coffin in Damian\u2019s basement. Can you believe it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a little extreme. Are they serious, Glory?\u201d Sienna gathered up her own coat and purse. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAs a heart attack. She\u2019s got years to go to pay off Ian unless she comes into some big bucks.\u201d I looked around my crowded place. Aggie wasn\u2019t the only one who needed big bucks. Worn chairs, drapes, kitchen table. I\u2019d given up on an area rug after Boogie had upchucked his fifth hair ball. Since my last fledgling vampire, Penny, had left her cat with me, I\u2019d learned to deal with having a few kitty calamities. Any way you looked at it, compared to Lily\u2019s new place, mine was a dump.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t audition anywhere else yet, Aggie. I\u2019m going to see what I can arrange. We pay our backup singers pretty well. You could probably give this Ian whatever he says you\u2019re working off each week and still have money left over.\u201d Sienna laughed when Aggie lunged, throwing her arms around her.</p><p>\u201cHoney, you have no idea how desperate I am to be free of that egomaniac.\u201d Aggie pushed back, tears in her eyes. \u201cI never see him anymore, thank the goddess. Instead, he leaves me lists of things he says I do wrong every day. He wants his towels folded a certain way. I should bleach his jockey shorts.\u201d She got an evil grin. \u201cDid that, even his black silk ones.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBet he loved that.\u201d I had to admit that Ian could be a real bastard.</p><p>\u201cThe latest list told me to scrub the grout in his bathroom with a toothbrush. If I did, it would be with the one he uses on his own stupid fangs.\u201d Aggie danced around the room, singing a song she must have made up on the spot. It featured four-letter words and invited Ian to shove his lists.</p><p>\u201cI guess we\u2019d better make this happen then. And won\u2019t it be fun, singing together?\u201d Sienna put her hand on Rafe\u2019s when he set her guitar in its case. \u201cDo you mind bringing that along? We may do an acoustic number. Though how Ray and I can still go on together when I don\u2019t want to see or speak to that bastard ever again is beyond me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cContract, Sienna.\u201d Rafe carried the guitar to the door. \u201cLet\u2019s go, ladies. Glory, you got what you need?\u201d</p><p>I grabbed my purse then at the last minute shoved the voodoo book and my computer into a tote and brought them along. If I had time, I\u2019d like to get started on that list of ingredients. Even if I didn\u2019t have to worry about Mel coming after me, a stay-away potion could help Jerry. I wanted it. And maybe one of my staff would be able to help. With ancient shifters you never knew what kind of connections they had.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m ready.\u201d I locked the door with my new key. A locksmith had changed the locks during the day, thanks to Jerry. He had a shifter who arranged such things for him. I\u2019d have to pack when we got back, before sunrise. The idea of that peace and quiet upstairs put a smile on my face despite the fact that Aggie and Sienna started bickering on the way down about which musical group they thought had the best sound.</p><p>\u201cYou guys are arguing about the wrong decade.\u201d Rafe put in his two cents. He named bands from the sixties, some of which were still playing. This set off Sienna, who had strong opinions, and the commotion was pretty loud by the time we stepped into the alley. Rafe came to an abrupt halt, his arm out like he was ready to shove us all back into the building.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sienna peered around him. \u201cPaparazzi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Something much worse. Use one of your new vampire senses and take a whiff.\u201d He set her guitar down inside the hallway and motioned us back. \u201cWhat do you smell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCandy?\u201d She sniffed and made a face. \u201cBut there\u2019s something off. Did the muffin shop burn a batch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, is she here?\u201d I had already ruled out the zombies. Aggie and Sienna scurried out of the way when I stepped to Rafe\u2019s side. \u201cThat\u2019s the smell of evil. Memorize it, Sienna. You and Aggie stay in here until we give you the all clear. I mean it. Do not come out. This is serious.\u201d I glared at both of them.</p> <p>\u201cI get it. Voooodoooo.\u201d Aggie shook her hands in the air. \u201cGo. Run her off. I know I\u2019m not interested in tangling with a psycho bitch.\u201d Aggie pulled on Sienna\u2019s sleeve. \u201cCome on back upstairs. Glory, call us on your cell when we can safely come down again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Sienna snatched up her guitar. \u201cTake care of yourselves, you two.\u201d She patted my back, gave Rafe a worried look, then rushed back up the stairs after Aggie. \u201cHey, wait up. I\u2019m no hero either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Now follow them, Glory.\u201d Rafe grabbed my arm and tried to ease me back inside.</p><p>\u201cNot on your life. This is my fight. If she\u2019s planning an ambush, it\u2019s for me. I\u2019m dying to hear what she has to say.\u201d I brushed past him, firmly taking his hand off of me. \u201cCome out, come out, wherever you are.\u201d I taunted her and why not? I wasn\u2019t convinced I couldn\u2019t take Mel in a fair fight.</p><p>\u201cCareful, Glory. I\u2019m reading your mind. Just what makes you think this woman\u2019s into fighting fair?\u201d Rafe stayed close, his eyes narrowed as he scanned the dark alley. The lights were out again.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s this with you, Gloriana? Moving on already?\u201d Mel stepped out of the darkness. No business suit tonight. Instead she wore a black silk outfit that flowed loosely around her body. A dozen necklaces sparkled in the dim moonlight. I thought I saw a bone dangling from one of them. Or was it a tooth? Did those things help her with her powers? Maybe I\u2019d rip them all off and find out.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my business, Melisandra. What do you want? Seems like you\u2019ve caused enough trouble around here already. Time to hit the road and go back where you came from.\u201d I grabbed Rafe\u2019s arm. We were supposed to be a couple now. Might as well start acting like one.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do that. I have obligations. And one of them is to make you pay for hurting Jeremiah.\u201d She stretched her long fingers toward me and I saw her creepy dead people come out to play again. Spirits, I guess you\u2019d call them. The tiny wisps of howling creatures flew up from her fingertips to gather in a circle above her head.</p> <p>\u201cYou think I hurt Jerry? What are you smoking, lady?\u201d I let her see my fangs. I had to remind myself of the part I was supposed to play. \u201cHe hurt me, but he won\u2019t ever again. I\u2019ve had it with Jeremiah Campbell and his lies. As if the Jerry I know ever had to be drugged to have sex with a woman.\u201d I brushed off my sleeve, the picture of Don\u2019t give a damn. Mel\u2019s face had hardened. Good, my shot had hit the target.</p><p>\u201cIs that what he told you?\u201d She managed to sound outraged. Nice try.</p><p>\u201cForget what he told me.\u201d I snuggled up to Rafe. \u201cI\u2019ve got a man now who I know won\u2019t cheat on me. Rafe and I have a history and now we\u2019re back together for good. Isn\u2019t that right, baby?\u201d I didn\u2019t give Rafe a chance to answer before I planted a big kiss on him to show Mel I was serious. Rafe cooperated, but I could feel the tension in his body, the way his bicep flexed where I held his arm. He was still on high alert, obviously worried about the woman standing a few feet away with her ghosts and ghouls doing an aerial ballet above her head. I had a feeling they were waiting for orders.</p><p>I pulled back and quirked an eyebrow at Mel. \u201cStill here? Why? Jeremiah\u2019s all yours. If you\u2019re sure you want him. But if my man ran around claiming he only had sex with me because I drugged him?\u201d I put a hand on my hip. \u201cWell, I can\u2019t tell you how fast I\u2019d kick him to the curb.\u201d I gave her a look, up and down. \u201cOh. But maybe you did have to resort to a little help in that department. Seriously? Slip a little something into his blood last night, Mel?\u201d</p><p>Mel\u2019s hands shook and her creatures became more agitated. \u201cShut the hell up. Of course I didn\u2019t have to drug Jeremiah. He\u2019s crazy about me.\u201d She laughed suddenly, her scarlet mouth reminding me of the silent scream in the mural Flo had painted on my wall inside the shop. Insanity lurked in her eyes. Oh, yeah, this woman knew crazy all right.</p><p>\u201cIf you did drug him, that would make you pretty damned pathetic, wouldn\u2019t it? Desperate.\u201d I couldn\u2019t resist. \u201cJerry begged me to take him back last night. Hands and knees, the whole nine yards. Even brought out an engagement ring. Now, that was pathetic.\u201d</p><p>Mel\u2019s eyes flashed, the spirits above her flinging themselves into a chaotic circle dance. \u201cLiar. Jeremiah would never demean himself that way. Now who\u2019s pathetic?\u201d She smiled, her teeth very white and even. \u201cDoes it sting to know that if you\u2019d truly satisfied him he never would have turned to me in the first place, Gloriana?\u201d</p><p>I tensed, desperate to throw myself at her. Rafe\u2019s strong arm clamped around my waist, holding me back.</p><p>\u201cJeremiah says my blood is like fine wine. He can\u2019t get enough of it.\u201d She waved her arms, clearly in the middle of building her own fantasy.</p><p>I pulled myself back from the brink of joining her in Crazyland, happy to burst her bubble. \u201cHe\u2019s a vampire, Mel. Get a clue. We suck mortal blood to survive. The man would build you a temple and worship you like a goddess if it would get him a bite at your vein, honey.\u201d And didn\u2019t I hate that fact. My don\u2019t-give-a-damn attitude was wearing thin. At least Mel didn\u2019t look too happy either. \u201cIf Jerry\u2019s so into you, where is he? Why isn\u2019t he with you now?\u201d</p><p>The ghosts and ghoulies above Mel went wild, screaming as they darted around like lightning bugs on speed. Her dark hair rose, a nimbus around her head. The freakish squeals became so high-pitched that I wanted to cover my ears.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d Rafe started forward.</p><p>\u201cNo, leave her alone, lover. I can take it.\u201d I kept a hand on his arm, willing him to stay safe. \u201cHear her howls of pain? Lost him, didn\u2019t you, Mel?\u201d It was my turn to laugh and I managed a pretty good one.</p><p>Mel\u2019s eyes blazed and her creatures paused in mid-screech. \u201cLast night we made love, Gloriana. Jeremiah and I. It was incredible. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be back.\u201d She raised her hands and we were rushed, those ghostie things suddenly tearing at my flesh. Rafe cursed and lunged at her. I touched his back, turning him to stone. I knew he\u2019d hate that, but I didn\u2019t want him getting into it with a voodoo woman. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a damn if Jerry wants you or not. I\u2019m over the unfaithful bastard.\u201d I said it one more time. I wanted to be sure she heard me and knew I meant it.</p><p>\u201cThen you won\u2019t care what happens next.\u201d She smiled, smoke and mist filled the alley, then she and her entourage disappeared.</p><p>I released my hold on Rafe.</p> <p>\u201cDamn it, Glory. Why\u2019d you do that? I could\u2019ve taken her.\u201d Rafe stomped over to where Mel had been standing and began searching the alley. \u201cShe\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you could have handled her. Maybe not. I still don\u2019t know what she can do. Did you feel those creatures hit you?\u201d I looked down at my arms, expecting to see blood or at least some red marks. Nothing.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Stung like a son of a bitch.\u201d Rafe rubbed his cheek. \u201cBut I still think . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet it go. Looks like she\u2019s done with me. But I\u2019m afraid she\u2019s still after Jerry. We\u2019ll see.\u201d I pulled out my cell and called upstairs, giving Sienna and Aggie the all clear to come down. \u201cWhen we go to the seminar Saturday night, we\u2019ll see how she acts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still want to do that?\u201d Rafe looked at me like I\u2019d lost my mind. Maybe I had. I either had a bad case of \u201cKnow your enemy\u201d or I was letting Lily\u2019s fab apartment get to me.</p> <p>\u201cWhy not? Sin bought those expensive tickets and I\u2019m interested in Mel\u2019s message when she\u2019s doing her motivational thing and not channeling evil spirits. Own the world. I could get behind that. The woman may be a few ghosts short of a gaggle, but she\u2019s got plenty of confidence. And her Web site impressed me. It\u2019s about time I got ambitious, don\u2019t you think?\u201d I heard the back door open.</p><p>\u201cNot touching that one.\u201d Rafe shrugged. \u201cGuess you want to spare the ladies the details of what just went down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely. Just another ordinary night in this alley.\u201d I laughed, relieved to have gotten through the confrontation with Mel without either of us getting hurt.</p><p>Rafe shook his head. \u201cLet\u2019s go then. Shop first, but only for an hour. I need to get to N-V.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Rafe. You were awesome. Sorry about the kiss and turning you into a statue.\u201d I hugged him then kissed his cheek.</p><p>\u201cI figured the kiss was a perk. Feel free anytime.\u201d He didn\u2019t let me go. \u201cThe freeze thing? Lose it. Makes me crazy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d I touched his cheek. \u201cIt comes so easily . . .\u201d I kept my arms around him. Maybe Mel was still lurking close enough for a glimpse, though I couldn\u2019t smell her now.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well. Use it on bad guys, not your friends.\u201d He stepped back and grabbed Sienna\u2019s guitar when she handed it to him as soon as she cleared the door. Then he made up a story about a false alarm when Aggie and Sienna peppered us with questions.</p><p>We headed into my shop. Aggie couldn\u2019t quit talking about new clothes, and flashy stage clothes didn\u2019t come cheap. We were trolling through my evening wear when the candidate for Sienna\u2019s bodyguard came in.</p><p>Danny Potter was a shape-shifter who\u2019d worked for Rafe in the club for a while but had been looking for something that paid more than bouncing out unruly college kids. Rafe vouched for him and we all liked him on sight. He was big, could look mean when he needed to, and his size was intimidating. He stood about six foot six and had a neck the size of Sienna\u2019s waist. His dark skin and eyes matched his black cotton shirt and jeans.</p><p>\u201cCall me Danny.\u201d He shook hands with everyone except Rafe, who got a serious fist bump. Then he proceeded to stand back and watch the room. I immediately felt safer.</p><p>\u201cHey, Danny.\u201d Sienna called him over. \u201cHave you met Israel Caine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. He\u2019s played the club several times since he moved to town. Great guy.\u201d Danny smiled.</p><p>\u201cWrong answer. From now on, he\u2019s on your shit list.\u201d Sienna pulled Danny to the back room, I assume to fill her guard in on why she hated Ray.</p> <p>Fine by me. If she wanted to use her bodyguard to intimidate Ray, that was between them. That left me with Aggie, who had an armful of cocktail dresses and was headed for the dressing room.</p><p>\u201cHold it. Let me look at your choices.\u201d I grabbed the stack.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You said I could shop.\u201d Aggie glanced around the store. We were fairly busy, with only a week until Halloween. I wasn\u2019t going to let her pick my best looks for herself when I might never get paid for them.</p><p>\u201cThese are going back.\u201d I took the most expensive and separated them from the pile. \u201cTry on these two, then I\u2019m finding you a pair of good silky black pants and a few glitzy tops to go with them. You\u2019re going to have to be practical. If you don\u2019t get a regular gig, you may have to bring this stuff back and let me resell it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously? What are you? The fashion police?\u201d Aggie frowned down at my choices. \u201cThese are the cheapest things you\u2019ve got. And I hate black. I need color! Pizazz!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need black if you\u2019re singing backup. And it\u2019s kinder on those new bulges you developed when you pigged out on Halloween candy, Aggie.\u201d I had no sympathy when all I could do was sniff the candy she\u2019d brought home by the bag.</p><p>\u201cHalloween candy? I hear you.\u201d A woman stopped on her way to the costumes. \u201cI\u2019m a sucker for candy corn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCandy corn?\u201d Aggie got interested. \u201cI haven\u2019t tried it yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPure sugar and pure heaven. No fat grams either.\u201d She looked Aggie up and down. \u201cYou look great to me. Honey, quit ragging on her.\u201d This was addressed to me with a glare. \u201cThe girl\u2019s got a nice rack. She should go low cut and the muffin top won\u2019t be noticed. Am I right?\u201d The stranger gave Aggie a friendly elbow.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve always said. Show off your boobs and the men never look past them.\u201d Aggie snatched back a green dress, the color of her eyes. It did have a deep vee neckline. \u201cThis one will look fantastic.\u201d She turned to her new friend. \u201cI\u2019m a singer. These will be my work clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding? Here\u2019s my card. June Raymond, wedding planner. If you call me, I might be able to try you out. If you\u2019re interested in another gig. We\u2019re always looking for entertainment. I\u2019d have to hear you sing first of course.\u201d The woman slapped a gold-trimmed card into Aggie\u2019s hand. \u201c\u2018Wedding\u2019s by June.\u2019 Catchy, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Clearly Aggie didn\u2019t have a clue about that but she smiled and nodded. \u201cI may be singing backup on Halloween at N-V for Sienna Star and Israel Caine. Come catch the show and see for yourself if I\u2019ll do for your weddings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. Seriously? You\u2019d have to be good to sing with those two.\u201d The woman walked with Aggie toward the dressing room. \u201cThat show\u2019s a sellout. But I heard they may be adding another one at midnight. Know anything about that?\u201d</p><p>I felt a presence at my back. \u201cRafe. Are you adding a midnight show? Can I get a ticket?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever needed one?\u201d He rested his hand on my shoulder. \u201cYes, I\u2019m in talks with Nate about a midnight show. Agents. He\u2019s being tough with the negotiation but I think we\u2019ll have a deal. You definitely have to come. Get Flo and Richard to come too. Even Damian. I\u2019ll reserve a table for you guys. The usual spot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish Jerry . . .\u201d I sighed. \u201cWell, maybe he\u2019ll be back and this Mel thing will be over by then.\u201d I turned to the customer. \u201cThis is the owner of N-V. Give her the scoop, Rafe.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at June. \u201cMidnight show is in the works. Check our Web site for ticket info. News really soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it a costume party? Halloween night at N-V?\u201d June looked Rafe over and clearly liked what she saw.</p><p>\u201cYes, there will be a contest too. Big prizes. Buy one here. This shop has the best costumes in town.\u201d He glanced at his watch. \u201cI hate to break this up, Glory, but I need to get over there. Nate is meeting me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think I could just stay here?\u201d I watched June rush over to the costume rack. She glanced back at Rafe then grabbed a naughty pirate girl outfit. I could tell from here that it was going to be too small, though maybe that was the look she was going for\u2014too tight and skimpy.</p><p>\u201cNo, I promised Blade I\u2019d stick close. Come with me. It should be worth it just to watch what happens when Sienna drags Aggie in there to sing with Ray and the band.\u201d Rafe grinned.</p><p>\u201cYou are so right.\u201d I looked up in time to see Aggie come out in the green dress. I had to admit, it was the right look. I nodded and she squealed and rushed over to hug me.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Glo. I\u2019m wearing it to N-V right now.\u201d She handed me the tag. Obviously she\u2019d counted on winning that decision. \u201cCan Megan hold my old clothes behind the counter for me?\u201d She thrust the bundle into my hands.</p><p>\u201cGuess so. Good luck tonight. I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d I watched her scurry to the back room where Sienna and Danny waited.</p><p>\u201cShe did look good.\u201d Rafe hadn\u2019t missed the amount of cleavage she was showing.</p><p>\u201cOn my dime.\u201d I walked over to the counter and told Megan what to do with Aggie\u2019s clothing. After a brief conference to make sure the shop was in good hands, Rafe and I headed to N-V. Sienna waved us off, still interested in shopping. Now she had Danny to help her with any paparazzi who might show up, and obviously she wanted Ray to have to wait for her. More games. This night had already worn me out and I figured there was more excitement yet to come.</p><p>The club was busy of course. I was glad for Rafe\u2019s sake. He\u2019d been able to buy out his partner recently and it was all his now. He headed for his office and I trailed along. Sienna and Aggie were supposed to stop by the office before they went up to the practice room. I wanted to go over some guidelines with Danny. The bodyguard claimed to be familiar with vampires, but had never taken on a new one before. I had to be sure he had a handle on how Sienna might react around mortals during these early nights after her transition. Rafe opened his office door and we found Nate and Ray had beat us there. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGlory, good to see you. Valdez.\u201d Ray jumped up from where he\u2019d been lounging in Rafe\u2019s desk chair and managed to catch me in a hug. I turned my face when he tried to kiss me.</p><p>\u201cNot happening, Ray.\u201d I pushed him away. \u201cHi, Nate. How\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, I guess. Ray\u2019s been telling me about what happened with Sienna. I\u2019m sorry about that.\u201d Nate stood next to the desk and came close to hug me.</p> <p>I was happy to let him kiss me on the cheek. Nathan Burke had been nothing but understanding since he\u2019d found out about his best friend\u2019s \u201ccondition.\u201d If you could call being turned vampire a condition. Anyway, Nate was a brilliant manager and had helped out with the logistics of keeping Ray\u2019s career on track when everything had to be done at night. He\u2019d also served as a mortal blood donor in an emergency. Now we were asking him to help Sienna with her career too. Was it too much?</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to do it. As a favor to me.\u201d Ray stayed next to me. \u201cCome on, Glory. You know it was an accident. Are you ever going to forgive me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me some time, Ray. I have Sienna living with me, a constant reminder of your inability to restrain yourself. It\u2019s not a good way to forgive and forget.\u201d I pushed past him and settled into a chair. \u201cSienna\u2019s going to ask you to do her a favor tonight. Granting it might help my attitude toward you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Ray sat in the chair next to me. We both ignored Rafe and Nathan, who had started going through some paperwork. Probably those contracts for the extra performance. I hoped the bombshell I was about to drop wouldn\u2019t affect Rafe\u2019s big Halloween special.</p><p>\u201cYou know who else I have crammed into my tiny apartment?\u201d I spotted a fridge in the corner of Rafe\u2019s office and jumped up to check it out. Hah! Rafe had put a couple of bottles of my favorite synthetic blood in there. I glanced at Ray and he nodded so I handed him one.</p> <p>\u201cPenny\u2019s not back in town, is she?\u201d Ray twisted off the cap and took a swallow.</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019ll be here for Christmas. Guess again.\u201d I opened my own drink. \u201cForget guessing. It\u2019s Aggie. I\u2019m stuck with our favorite Siren.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you get so lucky?\u201d Ray put his hand on my knee. \u201cKick her out. You don\u2019t need to be puttin\u2019 up with her shit.\u201d</p><p>I gave him a brief rundown of Aggie\u2019s problem with Ian. \u201cI\u2019m trying to get her out of there and tonight\u2019s the first step. She\u2019s been working off her debt but it will take years. Now she\u2019s got a chance to make some real money. Singing. It will make that debt disappear a lot faster.\u201d I took a drink.</p><p>\u201cShe does have a great voice. Good looks too.\u201d Ray smiled. \u201cPity the people who have to deal with her though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can behave if she knows it will get her what she wants, Ray.\u201d I let his hand stay where it was, even though he had started rubbing my leg, his hand slipping under the edge of my dress. I\u2019d worn a blue one, a gift from my mother, and he was eyeing the low neckline. I\u2019d put it on for Jerry. Rafe glanced over his shoulder at the two of us and frowned.</p> <p>\u201cRay, Glory\u2019s with Blade now.\u201d Rafe just had to say it.</p><p>\u201cBet that makes your tail droop, Valdez.\u201d Ray grinned. \u201cI\u2019m having a nice talk with our gal. Tend to your papers. Nate, I want a bonus if we go to standing room only on the extra show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsshole,\u201d Rafe muttered then went back to the negotiations.</p><p>Nate laughed and made a note on the papers. \u201cGot it, bud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRay, Sienna\u2019s bringing Aggie with her to the club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit. Why?\u201d He set his bottle on the floor. \u201cAre those two actually hitting it off? Has Sin lost her mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible, Ray. You ruined her life when you made her vampire against her will. Or at least that\u2019s her take on it. Remember what that\u2019s like? How waking up vampire can mess you up?\u201d I took a swallow of my drink. \u201cShe\u2019s lost, grasping at anything that makes her feel in control. She and Aggie sang together and liked the sound. Now Sienna\u2019s got an idea\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me\u2014\u201d He jumped to his feet, knocking over the half-empty bottle of synthetic. The red liquid spread across the hardwood floor. Rafe cursed and grabbed a wad of paper towels from the bathroom next to his office.</p> <p>\u201cMeet your new backup singer, Ray.\u201d Sienna swept in through the door Rafe had left open.</p><p>\u201cOver my dead body.\u201d Ray grabbed the empty bottle. Surely he wasn\u2019t thinking of using it as a weapon. I turned him to stone before he could make another move.</p><p>\u201cThat can be arranged.\u201d Sienna touched his cheek. For once Aggie showed good sense and didn\u2019t say a word. \u201cOh, Glory. Can you show me this trick? I kind of like Ray when he can\u2019t shoot off his mouth.\u201d She made it worse by punching him in the stomach.</p><p>\u201cHey. Stop it!\u201d I glanced at Ray. Of course he couldn\u2019t even wince, still a statue. Sienna ignored me. She was in Ray\u2019s face, stabbing a black-painted fingernail into his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea how much I hate you. If I say Aggie sings with us, she sings.\u201d She poked him twice for emphasis. \u201cHell, if I want her to headline, she\u2019ll be front and center.\u201d Poke. \u201cYou owe me, Ray. And don\u2019t you forget it.\u201d One more poke then she kneed him, right in his family jewels.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God!\u201d I couldn\u2019t stand it. I froze Sienna and let Ray go. I had to stop using this power whenever it was convenient. Not only was it unfair, but look what it had done. Ray dropped like a rock, moaning and holding himself as he went to the fetal position.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d he gasped. \u201cI don\u2019t know who to blame here. Sienna, damn it!\u201d His fangs were down and I stepped back when he glared at me. \u201cGlory, don\u2019t you ever, I mean ever do that to me again.\u201d Ray closed his eyes, his knees tucked against his chest as he cursed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ray. I had no idea . . .\u201d I glanced at Rafe. He just shook his head. He and Nate looked pained, obviously members of the \u201cguy\u201d club and full of sympathy for Ray, who still couldn\u2019t stand.</p><p>I jumped in front of Sienna and poked her. \u201cListen to me, Sienna. What you just did was wrong on so many levels. I know you\u2019re mad at Ray, but to hit him when he can\u2019t defend himself is unfair.\u201d I stopped. Hadn\u2019t he drained her blood when she\u2019d been unconscious? I stepped over to Ray and nudged him with my foot. \u201cGet up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan, that was fast. Sympathy gone already?\u201d He used the chair next to him to get to his feet, though it wasn\u2019t without a moan. \u201cWhat now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right. If she wants Aggie to sing with you guys, then you have to let her.\u201d I looked toward the door, trying to communicate to the former Siren that now would be a good time to try a little humility. She actually did look embarrassed, her cheeks pink and her eyes down, like maybe she wasn\u2019t going to be her usual I\u2019m all that Aggie.</p><p>\u201cGive her a chance, Ray. Listen to her sing with Sienna. They sounded really good together at my place.\u201d I touched Sienna, hoping she\u2019d heard me and would come out of her freeze with the right attitude.</p><p>\u201cJeez, but I hate that statue thing you do, Glory. Not that I don\u2019t want to learn it.\u201d Sienna brushed at her hair, sneezed and shivered.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t teach it to you. It\u2019s an inherited skill. From Olympus.\u201d I was really glad few people had it. All eyes were on me and several people in the room would have turned me to stone in a heartbeat and left me there to stew for a good long while if given the chance. \u201cSorry.\u201d I gave them all a repentant look. No one was buying it.</p><p>\u201cI get it. If I had it, I\u2019d use it too. Especially around here.\u201d Sienna wheeled on Ray, who still looked ready to throw up. \u201cHell, I am sorry. I won\u2019t hit you again, Ray. But I still haven\u2019t forgiven you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Fine.\u201d Ray frowned at Aggie. \u201cI still haven\u2019t forgiven Aggie either. You don\u2019t know what she put Glory and me through, Sin. Obviously Glory has the memory of a gnat or she just doesn\u2019t give a shit what people do to her. Me? I remember every bit of your torture, Aggie. You\u2019d better sing like a fuckin\u2019 angel. That\u2019s all I\u2019m sayin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll let me do it?\u201d Aggie\u2019s face lit up in a grin. \u201cJust wait. I still have my song, Ray, my beautiful Siren\u2019s voice. It doesn\u2019t work to enchant men anymore, but it\u2019s pretty damned good, isn\u2019t it, Sin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say.\u201d Sienna walked over to lean against Rafe\u2019s desk. \u201cNate, did Ray tell you my management problem?\u201d She wasn\u2019t smiling. \u201cI had to call Ethan this evening and tell him I was thinking about making a change.\u201d Tears filled her eyes. \u201cYou have no idea how hard that was. The man\u2019s stuck with me through two stints in rehab. And\u201d\u2014she gulped\u2014\u201che was so nice on the phone. Just said he\u2019d be happy to help whoever I chose to replace him.\u201d Big sniffle. \u201cHe\u2019s such a classy guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sienna.\u201d Nate put a hand on her shoulder. \u201cYes, Ray told me everything. I know Ethan. You\u2019re right. He\u2019s top-drawer. I\u2019ll give him a call. No need to fire him. We\u2019ll work together. Coordinate. I can\u2019t take on your full load anyway. Ethan can handle most of your business and all I\u2019ll need to cover is your scheduling. Since Ray went vamp, I\u2019ve gotten pretty good at figuring out how to make everything happen after dark.\u201d He smiled at Sienna. \u201cNo one will ever suspect a vampire is on their books. Not even Ethan. Leave it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Nate. That\u2019s seriously a huge relief.\u201d Sienna headed over to the door where she linked arms with Aggie. \u201cNow let\u2019s get upstairs and show Ray how you\u2019ll fit in with the band, Ag. Prepare to be amazed, Israel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d Ray rolled his eyes. \u201cGlory, come with us. I need moral support.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was my turn to roll my eyes. \u201cNo thanks. I have my own problems to deal with. You guys go ahead.\u201d I sat back down and pulled out my phone. I needed some ingredients and had an idea where I might be able to find them. I opened my voodoo book then hit speed dial, ignoring Ray\u2019s grumbling as he left the room.</p><p>Maybe this wasn\u2019t the best idea in the world, but I was desperate. If Mel still wanted Jerry, I had to do something to kill her interest and the potion was my best bet. If I had to deal with the devil to make that happen, so be it.</p><p>Ten</p> <p>When the man answered, I got right down to business. \u201cHey, Ian, do you have any, um, Periplaneta americana? I need some. Two to be exact. Crushed. Though I guess whole ones would work and I could pound them out myself.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. I mean, big guffaws. I could picture him wiping away tears he was so overcome.</p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s so funny? Is it something gross? Tell me. Do you have it or not? I\u2019m making a potion and that\u2019s an ingredient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlory, Glory, Glory. Yes, I\u2019m sure I could scrounge up a couple. And I\u2019d love to watch you crush them. Need anything else?\u201d He was still chuckling. Obviously there was a joke here I was missing.</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s a long list.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen come on over.\u201d He started laughing again. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see what else goes into this, um, potion. What does it do? Or dare I ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it. Obviously I pronounced it wrong or it\u2019s the name of an extinct dinosaur.\u201d I had to wait while he went into another fit of hysterics at my expense. Honestly, for a usually dour Scot, Ian was being downright out of control.</p><p>\u201cSorry. Coming or not?\u201d He finally settled down.</p><p>\u201cYes. But not tonight. I guess I should say thanks for offering despite finding me hilarious. It\u2019s late and my bodyguard has too much going on. Tomorrow night. I\u2019ll tell you more then.\u201d I saw Rafe smile with relief and go back to his papers. Nate had taken off for upstairs, muttering about signatures. Apparently their deal had been hammered out.</p><p>\u201cBodyguard? What kind of trouble are you in now?\u201d Ian dropped the teasing.</p><p>\u201cVoodoo trouble. That\u2019s why I need to make this potion. I\u2019ve got a book here that has a recipe to help me get rid of someone. You ever had a run-in with voodoo?\u201d I settled back. It would be a bonus if Ian had some experience.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to mess with that stuff, Glory. You need to get rid of someone, tear out his or her throat. If it\u2019s a mortal, it would be for your dining pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, yuck. I don\u2019t kill mortals. Second, I want her to leave us alone, not die.\u201d Honestly, Ian had no conscience whatsoever.</p><p>\u201cFine. But forget voodoo and let me call my sorcerer again. Of course you know that comes with a price.\u201d Ian had his groove back now, definitely figuring out an agenda. \u201cWe can work together. I told you I was interested in getting to know you better. Your powers fascinate me. Especially your Olympus connection. Perhaps in exchange for my help, you\u2019d spend some quality time with me. Just the two of us.\u201d</p><p>I heard it in his voice. Unbelievable. Ian had seduction on his mind. Apparently my goddess parentage suddenly made me desirable. I bit back the names I really wanted to call him and took a breath.</p><p>\u201cIan, I\u2019m with Blade. Period. I\u2019m not about to get cozy with a MacDonald, feud or no feud.\u201d The Campbells\u2014Jerry\u2019s Scottish clan\u2014and MacDonalds had called a truce but Ian\u2019s history didn\u2019t inspire trust. Too bad he was the go-to guy in Austin for all things science related when you were dealing with the weird and wacky in our world.</p><p>\u201cGlory, you wound me. Shutting me down before you\u2019ve given me a chance? Aggie always swore I was the best lover she had ever had. High praise coming from a Siren with a cast of thousands for comparison. Ask her. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s still there sponging off of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAggie isn\u2019t singing your praises about anything, Ian. Scrubbing a man\u2019s toilet kills the love every time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom the looks of things around here, I doubt she\u2019s done much scrubbing. But she\u2019s been busy. I\u2019d like to know what the hell she\u2019s done to my bed linens. They feel like cardboard, no, make that sandpaper. I think I\u2019m developing a rash too.\u201d</p> <p>It was my turn to laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re whining, Ian. Surely you didn\u2019t expect a pampered Siren to be good at housework, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. I just wanted her to suffer. Is she suffering, Glory?\u201d His whine had disappeared. He was back to Ian as usual.</p><p>\u201cWe both are. Now about this voodoo. I am messing with it. The person I need to get rid of is making my life miserable. Jerry\u2019s too. I know you\u2019re already working with Bart. So will you help me too? I\u2019ll pay you for whatever ingredients you can find for me. That\u2019ll have to be the deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you can afford my rates, Glory. Here\u2019s my usual fee for consulting work.\u201d Ian quoted a figure and I gasped. \u201cThought not. But we\u2019ll work out something. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow night. Be sure to bring the book. Voodoo. I suppose this could be interesting. But I hope you aren\u2019t getting in over your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, so do I.\u201d I realized I hadn\u2019t sounded grateful when he was actually doing me a favor. Too bad there were always strings attached when dealing with Ian. \u201cThanks, Ian. Seriously. But don\u2019t expect anything more from me than a business relationship. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow night.\u201d I ended the call. Memo to Glory: Ian was a hard man and could be an even harder enemy. I needed him but I also needed to watch my back when I was around him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to see Ian tomorrow night?\u201d Rafe pulled me up out of my chair.</p><p>\u201cYou heard. Yes. Guess you\u2019re going to insist on being there too.\u201d I slipped the book back into my tote.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t miss it. Now let\u2019s head upstairs. We don\u2019t want to miss Aggie\u2019s audition either, do we?\u201d Rafe aimed me toward the door.</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d I left the book and my purse in his office, which he locked, then followed him to the practice room. Even before we got to the room, which was supposed to be soundproof, we could hear the arguing. I should have known getting rid of Aggie wouldn\u2019t be that easy.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to be quieter?\u201d Aggie\u2019s voice could probably be heard blocks away. \u201cMaybe I should turn off the mic, or, hey, lip-sync. I could just stand back here and be stage decoration.\u201d</p><p>Rafe and I slipped inside. Ray, Sienna and Aggie were standing close to the band. Those guys saw me and waved, but their attention stayed on the argument going on beside the makeshift stage.</p><p>\u201cYeah, do that. \u2019Cause the way you\u2019re blasting away back there, you obviously think you\u2019re the headliner.\u201d Ray examined her through narrowed eyes. \u201cYou may have the pipes and you\u2019re not bad window dressing, but you\u2019re disposable, Aggie. Quit stepping over my vocals. Sienna, back me up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate to admit it, but Ray\u2019s right. Tone it down, Aggie. Are you looking at the music? You aren\u2019t supposed to sing along with us. Instead just drop in at the chorus and hit the harmonies where it says to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew it. I don\u2019t need this. I\u2019ll just go on down the street. There are half a dozen clubs where I\u2019m sure I can talk my way into a gig.\u201d Aggie stomped away from them and shoved past Rafe, headed for the hall. I stopped her before she could escape.</p><p>\u201cQuitting already?\u201d I wouldn\u2019t budge, even though she slapped at my hand on her arm.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t going to work.\u201d She had tears in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right. Let her go.\u201d Ray was gleeful. \u201cI gave her a chance and she blew it.\u201d</p><p>Sienna ran over to wave sheet music in front of Aggie. \u201cJust look at the music, girlfriend. It tells you when to go high, low, loud, soft. Easy as pie.\u201d</p><p>Aggie shook her head. \u201cPie? I\u2019d give my left tit for a piece of pie right now.\u201d She leaned her head on my shoulder and I was too stunned to do more than allow it. \u201cHelp me, Glory. I can\u2019t read music.\u201d</p><p>We all just stared at her. How was that for a news flash?</p><p>\u201cQuit looking at me!\u201d She jerked away. \u201cWhy would I have to learn? I can hear a tune once and pick it up. That\u2019s a good skill, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Ag, it\u2019s amazing.\u201d Sienna touched Aggie\u2019s shoulder. \u201cBut it makes things tough here. There are marks on the page that indicate where you come in, when you should just hum, that kind of thing.\u201d She glanced at Ray. He wasn\u2019t looking sympathetic. \u201cI\u2019m sure we can walk you through it, if you\u2019ve got such a great memory. That should\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious.\u201d Ray wasn\u2019t in a conciliatory mood. \u201cAggie is trying to take over the performance. That was clear from the first note out of her mouth.\u201d Ray strolled over to my side. \u201cShe\u2019s a stage hog, Glory. People are paying to see and hear Sin and me, not some unknown.\u201d He glared at Aggie.</p><p>\u201cDid you like her voice though?\u201d I was relieved that Aggie had dried her tears and had her head close to Sienna\u2019s where they were going over the sheet music. Apparently the rocker was explaining the various marks. Aggie could read words at least. For a moment there I\u2019d wondered if she was illiterate. It wouldn\u2019t have surprised me. When I\u2019d been dumped out of the Siren system way back when, I hadn\u2019t been able to read word one.</p><p>\u201cGloriana, you must introduce me to Israel Caine.\u201d We all turned at the sound of that voice.</p><p>\u201cMother. What are you doing here?\u201d I wished Sienna\u2019s new bodyguard, who\u2019d stepped forward, would bounce her right out of there. Unfortunately, when he heard me call her mother, Danny went back to his post next to the door. Mom had on her version of rocker chic\u2014black leather pants and vest with a blue silk blouse, all of it with high-heeled boots. The result was more rocker stage mom. I smiled and sent her that mental message, earning a frown.</p><p>\u201cWhy, I came to tell your friend Israel something important since you seem reluctant to do it.\u201d My mother held out her hand. \u201cGloriana\u2019s told me so much about you, Mr. Caine. And I know a little about your history with my daughter.\u201d She smiled, like she was eager to begin dropping some bombshells. \u201cSteamy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMother!\u201d It seemed like a good time to dematerialize. Of course I couldn\u2019t. My mother had a habit of disabling my powers when she was around. \u201cForget Mr. Caine. You and I could hit the mall, do some shopping.\u201d I grabbed her arm, desperate to get her out of there.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. The mall has been closed for hours.\u201d She lifted my hand off of her. \u201cCareful, you\u2019re wrinkling my silk. Now where was I?\u201d She glanced around the room. \u201cAh, yes. Mr. Caine. May I call you Israel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake it Ray. What\u2019s up?\u201d He moved closer to me. Ray wasn\u2019t stupid and he could tell I was worried and embarrassed. Rafe had my other side. It didn\u2019t make me feel better. My mother had way too many powers for any intelligent person to relax around her.</p> <p>\u201cRay, then.\u201d Mother was practically purring. \u201cDid you know that I restored Gloriana\u2019s beautiful singing voice not long ago? Once I heard it had been taken from her, I had to right such a grievous wrong.\u201d She threw out her arms, like she was bestowing blessings on all of us. I almost expected twinkling stars and fairy dust.</p><p>\u201cNo kidding!\u201d Ray\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cGlory? Is that true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother, please. You sound like an actor in a bad superhero movie.\u201d I glanced meaningfully at the group of humans on the bandstand. \u201cYes, it\u2019s true.\u201d I gasped when Ray grabbed me, almost knocking me down.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s incredible!\u201d He kissed my cheek then grinned at my mother. \u201cYou are a superhero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother.\u201d I nodded toward the band again. The guys had started to stare at us.</p> <p>\u201cOne moment. I can take care of that.\u201d She flicked her wrist. \u201cNow they can\u2019t hear a thing we say.\u201d Her smile was wicked. \u201cSuperhero. Yes, I can live with that. Thank you.\u201d She focused on Ray. \u201cYou attract such handsome men, darling. Well done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother, what\u2019s the point of this little visit?\u201d I realized we were now in a virtual cocoon. The band couldn\u2019t hear us and we couldn\u2019t hear the band, which had settled down and started playing something on the other side of my mother\u2019s invisible wall. Even Nate, who\u2019d been sitting at a table against one wall with his laptop, had gone back to work, apparently lulled by whatever spell my mother had cast.</p><p>\u201cGloriana. Absolutely glorious. I named her so aptly, don\u2019t you think?\u201d She gave Rafe and Ray measuring looks before smiling at me. I was wrinkling her silk again, trying to drag her out of the room. \u201cPatience, darling. I have this situation well thought out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen were you going to tell me, Glory? This is tremendous news.\u201d Ray held me close.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been busy, Ray. With Sienna, Aggie, a lot of things.\u201d I dredged up a smile for him. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know how that ate at me. Your loss. I couldn\u2019t stand the fact that the Storm God . . .\u201d He shoved back and looked over his shoulder, then seemed reassured that the band still wasn\u2019t paying attention to us and that they were making music we couldn\u2019t hear. Ray shook his head, obviously amazed that my mother could arrange such a thing. \u201cWell, I hated what he\u2019d taken from you. You know that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do know it, Ray.\u201d I laid my hand on his cheek, the dark stubble covering it only making him more beautiful. No matter what Ray had done, I knew his love of music trumped almost everything else in his life. The loss of my song had hurt his artist\u2019s soul. \u201cYes, she gave me back my voice. I can sing again and not hurt your ears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fantastic, Glory.\u201d Rafe dragged me into his arms this time. His hug was fierce. \u201cI want to hear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! You should all hear her.\u201d Mother was levitating she was so excited. I jerked her back to the floor.</p><p>\u201cCalm down,\u201d I hissed.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s so exciting.\u201d She focused on the men. I had a feeling it was a habit with her. \u201cUnfortunately Gloriana doesn\u2019t have her Siren power anymore. So men won\u2019t fall at her feet.\u201d She winked. \u201cUnless they just love her for herself, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who doesn\u2019t?\u201d Ray dragged me toward the band at the other end of the large room. Mother\u2019s invisible wall suddenly disappeared. \u201cCome on, babe. I know you\u2019ve got every song I\u2019ve ever recorded memorized. I\u2019ve even heard you mangle a few when we were pretending to be engaged and shared a hotel room.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cYou remember, Valdez. She sounded like a stomped chicken when she sang in the shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo lie.\u201d Rafe was right with us. \u201cSing for us, Glory. I can\u2019t wait to hear you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, seriously. This is embarrassing.\u201d My mother\u2019s hand landed on my back. \u201cMother, stop manipulating me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut it\u2019s what I do best, darling. Sing for the boys. It\u2019s just not right that Aggie\u201d\u2014Mother frowned\u2014\u201cshould get to sing with this band and not you. Who deserves it more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe two of us don\u2019t compare. Aggie needs the money.\u201d I stopped at the foot of the stage.</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t?\u201d Mother took Ray\u2019s place by my side when he began conferencing with the band, deciding what I should sing without even asking me what I wanted. \u201cYou think I don\u2019t know how you feel about your tawdry little apartment? How your friend Florence hurt your feelings when she insisted you take her gifts because she hated to see you wearing used clothes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother, I\u2019ve told you how I feel about you snooping into my thoughts and conversations.\u201d My face burned. I was mortified that she would say this in front of Rafe. Sienna and Aggie were close enough to hear her too.</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t deny it.\u201d Mother glanced at the others. \u201cIf you\u2019re embarrassed, it\u2019s your own fault. It\u2019s high time you came into your own, Gloriana. If you won\u2019t come to Olympus and claim the fortune owed you, then perhaps you\u2019ll start showing off some of your other talents. Earn your own fortune here.\u201d Mother shoved me up onto the stage where Ray handed me a microphone. \u201cYou could be a star, darling. Bigger than that Sienna girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey! I heard that.\u201d Sienna had Aggie next to her. \u201cLet\u2019s hear what you\u2019ve got, Glory. We don\u2019t have to compete, you know. You mentor me for\u201d\u2014she glanced at the band\u2014\u201cyou know. So maybe I can mentor you in the music biz. Even steven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, uh, I never thought . . .\u201d My throat went dry and I caught Rafe staring at me. I\u2019d known him for years. Sung show tunes to him when we\u2019d driven to Texas from Las Vegas in my aging Suburban. He grinned, remembering how he\u2019d been in his dog form then, howling to drown me out. That relaxed me a little. I could actually sing decently now and wouldn\u2019t he be blown away? He nodded, like he was eager to hear me show off. That was my friend, always in my corner.</p><p>My mother stood beside him, beaming. I wasn\u2019t about to catch her eye again or she\u2019d toss one of her spells at me so I\u2019d sing, ready or not.</p><p>Ray sat at the piano. \u201cOkay, babe, you know this one. Come in when you\u2019re ready.\u201d He started playing, the tune one I knew instantly. The band joined in.</p><p>This was one of my favorites from Ray\u2019s first album. It was a love song and I closed my eyes. Jerry. I hoped he was okay and coming home soon. I kept my love for him in mind when I opened my eyes, focused somewhere on the wall above everyone and started to sing.</p><p>When the song ended there was complete silence. I felt my face get hot and quickly handed Ray the mic. So much for my \u201cglorious\u201d voice. Then everyone started talking at once.</p><p>\u201cDamn, girl, that was awesome. I never knew you had it in you.\u201d Ray passed off the microphone and grabbed me around the waist to swing me in a circle. \u201cYour mom\u2019s right. A star is born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Ray. You\u2019re not thinking straight.\u201d I wiggled my way down to my feet, sure he was exaggerating.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right for once, Glory. Your voice is amazing. If I hadn\u2019t heard it, I\u2019d never have believed it.\u201d Rafe helped me off the stage. \u201cYou should do something with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s different, nice and low. I\u2019m so glad you weren\u2019t shrill.\u201d Sienna exchanged looks with Ray. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe some of the wannabes who\u2019ve pushed their way in front of us with voices that could crack glass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo lie. Can\u2019t see her rocking out though.\u201d Ray moved closer to Sienna. \u201cWhat do you think, Sin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. I think we could do something cool with her though. Go retro.\u201d Sienna grabbed my arm. \u201cI\u2019m thinking ballads, Glory. Standards. The kind of thing Bubl\u00e9 does or maybe Adele. You sound like a combo of Amy Winehouse and Peggy Lee. What if you deck yourself out in fifties clothes? Do the whole look, along with the songs?\u201d Sienna was on a roll. \u201cCan you read music?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sure. I\u2019ve picked up a few skills along the way.\u201d I thought about the guitar I had shoved way back in the corner of my closet.</p><p>\u201cThat settles it. I could arrange some tunes for her. She can do covers, then original material with that same sound.\u201d Ray unzipped a backpack and pulled out a sheaf of paper. \u201cI wonder if I brought anything like that along . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea, Ray. And I\u2019ve always wanted to dig deeper into producing. I can see how this could go down. We\u2019d do a little showcase on Halloween night. Put Glory up for a number or two to open for us.\u201d</p><p>I just stood there in a daze. Obviously the two pros had this all figured out.</p><p>\u201cHey, what about me? Where\u2019s my showcase?\u201d Aggie wore a pout. \u201cI have the same kind of voice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue enough. But you don\u2019t have the heart Glory has when you sing. Sound\u2019s there but nobody\u2019s home if you know what I mean.\u201d Sienna stared at Aggie\u2019s blank look. \u201cGuess not. Sorry, Ag.\u201d She patted Aggie\u2019s hand. \u201cWork on learning that material we gave you. Right now your best bet is backing up Ray and me. Maybe someday you\u2019ll have a chance to do a single.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis sucks.\u201d Aggie stomped over to the door. \u201cI\u2019m out of here.\u201d</p><p>I started to follow her but my mother was still in the room, her eyes on Ray. What did she have up her sleeve, which was now part of a cute tie-dyed tee? Oh, God, had any of the mortal band members noticed her magic? She nodded to acknowledge my thoughts then waved her arm at them, probably to erase their memories of what she\u2019d been wearing before. I felt a headache coming on while Sienna kept chattering about Ray\u2019s musical arrangements and finding someone to play the piano.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it. Play for her.\u201d Ray slipped an arm around me. \u201cAre you listening to this, Glory girl? Can you see it? Spotlight on you, you\u2019re sitting on my piano in one of your vintage thingies. It\u2019s a costume party anyway. \u2019Cause of Halloween. What do you think?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI, I don\u2019t know.\u201d This was moving too fast.</p><p>\u201cSure you do.\u201d Ray kissed my cheek. \u201cI can pick up one of those fifties suits in your shop, match the look. We can meet and go over some musical numbers. Can you stand to work with me, Sin? For Glory?\u201d He knew better than to lay on the charm. Ray was being all business.</p><p>\u201cSeems like I can.\u201d Sienna grinned at me. \u201cThis is your shot, Glory. Come on. Say you\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGloriana, snap out of it.\u201d Mother pinched my arm.</p><p>\u201cOw.\u201d I guess I\u2019d spaced, more than a little overwhelmed.</p> <p>\u201cAnswer him. How do you feel about making your singing debut on Halloween night?\u201d My mother linked her arm with mine. \u201cI\u2019m sure your friend Rafael will pay you. And, Nathan, is it? Can you write up a contract with advantageous terms for my daughter?\u201d Mother had obviously been busy, introducing herself to Nate, who\u2019d been out of the loop until I started singing. Now he hurried forward.</p><p>\u201cYes, sure. Glory, are you in? I have to know. Rafe, what do you say? It would certainly make for a full evening. Guarantee a big draw for that new midnight show. Glory, I\u2019ll just put you down for the one appearance, at midnight. Opening act. What do you say?\u201d Nate pulled a legal pad out of his briefcase, ready to take notes, as if he could whip out a contract on the spot. He probably could.</p><p>\u201cThis is moving too fast.\u201d The room started to spin around me. What had I gotten into?</p><p>\u201cDarling, take your opportunities when they appear.\u201d My mother wasn\u2019t taking no for an answer. \u201cOf course she\u2019ll do it. Halloween. I think it\u2019s an auspicious night for a debut. Full moon if I\u2019m not mistaken. I\u2019ll have to consult my astrologer.\u201d She smiled. \u201cGloriana, answer the man.\u201d</p><p>My mother had an astrologer? Oh, what the hell. I had wanted to redo my apartment. Own the world. Whatever. If singing on Halloween would help me move forward, then why not? It was one night, one performance. If I bombed, no biggie. And if I didn\u2019t . . . ?</p><p>I felt a flutter of excitement. No, not getting my hopes up. Instead, I realized I was getting way too overscheduled. Rehearsals, potion making, seminar on how to own the world, reunion with Jerry, running my shop . . . I dropped down to the edge of the stage, my head between my knees before I threw up on my mother\u2019s shiny black boots.</p> <p>\u201cGlory?\u201d Rafe rubbed my back.</p><p>\u201cOffer her your vein, Nate.\u201d Ray didn\u2019t care who heard him.</p><p>\u201cGive her air.\u201d Sienna was too new to know that didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>\u201cEveryone stand back.\u201d My mother took charge. \u201cGloriana, look at me.\u201d</p><p>I raised my head, her face swimming into focus. Her hand felt cool under my chin, her voice clear inside my head.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do anything you don\u2019t want to. I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m bullying you.\u201d She sighed and kissed my forehead.</p><p>A calm came over me, my stomach settled, and I took her hand. She pulled me to my feet. Ridiculous to fall apart like that. This was the chance of a lifetime. Two famous rock stars were going to let me be their opening act? I\u2019d have to be crazy to turn that down. I grinned and actually hugged my mother.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p> <p>That started a chatterfest. Ray and Sienna argued about which songs I should do. Rafe and Nate headed over to the table and his laptop to discuss my compensation. My mother began an excited conversation about what I should wear. Then I glanced at the doorway. Aggie was back. She stared at me, her mouth a straight line that made it clear I\u2019d made a bitter enemy tonight. Was there any way to fix that?</p><p>\u201cAggie?\u201d I gestured for her to come over. My mother wasn\u2019t happy with it and tried to get between us when Aggie marched over.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not stupid. I know I need to take this gig. It pays well. Nathan showed me what I could earn. I\u2019ll sing in a whisper if it\u2019ll get me away from Ian\u2019s house.\u201d She smiled at one of the band members. \u201cHey, Jake. While all these other people are busy, would you run through that last number with me?\u201d She shoved past me, headed for the lead guitar player.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I needn\u2019t have bothered saying a word. Aggie had zeroed in on the newly single man who was straight, liked her cleavage and certainly could be in the market for her kind of action.</p><p>\u201cWatch her. She isn\u2019t going to be satisfied until she has that spotlight on her.\u201d My mother dragged me toward the door. \u201cI know her type well. Olympus is full of them. Jealous, vindictive. Next thing you know, you\u2019ll find a viper in your bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that would be courtesy of a certain voodoo woman. If you want to interfere in my life, how about taking a run at that situation?\u201d I stopped her in the hall. I knew Rafe would be mad if I went any further. He was taking his bodyguard role seriously and I had orders to stay close.</p><p>\u201cNo need. You handled it beautifully. You can\u2019t know how happy it made me to hear you say you were through with that Scot. Now if only you\u2019d meant it.\u201d She frowned. \u201cGive up this potion nonsense. I imagine your man\u201d\u2014she shuddered\u2014\u201ccan take care of himself. He did go off somewhere with that intention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I give up.\u201d I turned to go back inside. I needed to have input if I was actually going to sing on Halloween. Obviously my mother and I were never going to agree about Jerry. \u201cSince you\u2019re so big on snooping into my business, can you at least tell me if he\u2019s all right? If he\u2019s made it to Florida yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGloriana, you are too funny. Why would I care where that man is? It\u2019s you I follow closely. The woman seems satisfied that you are out of the Scot\u2019s picture. That\u2019s good enough for me.\u201d Mother studied my dress. \u201cMall shopping. I would like that but fear they wouldn\u2019t have anything up to my standards. We should go to New York, Paris, no, Rome!\u201d Her eyes lit up. \u201cThe spring showings are next week. What fun to take my daughter there and pick out next season\u2019s wardrobe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot happening, Mother. I just committed to sing next weekend. Remember? And I\u2019ll have to wear a fifties outfit. Maybe a cute shirtwaist, cocktail dress or a poodle skirt. See what you can find and put it in my closet.\u201d I touched her shoulder. \u201cThanks for my voice. I felt good up there. Singing. It was an amazing gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarling.\u201d She materialized a hanky and dabbed at her eyes. \u201cIt was the least I could do. I was so proud seeing you onstage. If you\u2019d come to Olympus, I could fix your figure too. Size six or four. Tiny waist and little butt. I know you\u2019d love to wear some skinny jeans like that Sienna girl wears.\u201d She leaned closer. \u201cDid you know her real last name is Starkowski?\u201d She waved her hanky. \u201cYou will be so much greater than she is as a performer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother, Sienna and I are friends. She\u2019s going to help me. And be satisfied with the relationship you\u2019ve got with me. I\u2019m talking to you. Maybe after the dust settles we can do a little shopping together. Flo would love to join us. How\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA girl\u2019s night out. Oh, Gloriana.\u201d Mother wrapped me in her arms and I endured it. Then she pushed back, eyeing my hips and shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cAnd forget my body. I\u2019m okay with it. I\u2019m not going to Olympus. Just forget it. Please?\u201d The very idea of the place terrified me. Every hint she threw out made it seem like the penthouse level of hell.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d She looked disappointed. \u201cShopping though. You promised.\u201d She tapped her forehead, her brow wrinkling. \u201cOh, I must go. I hear Zeus calling and when my father wants me, I can\u2019t afford to ignore him.\u201d She smiled. \u201cNot like you ignore me, you bad girl.\u201d Then she got serious. \u201cDarling, I may have misled you just a teeny bit. I didn\u2019t actually tell Zeus about you yet. If or when he finds out . . . Well, he may insist you come. I won\u2019t be able to fight that. You may have no choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother . . .\u201d I tried to grab her. For an explanation. Details. Something. But of course she chose that moment to vanish. Coward.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Rafe stuck his head into the hall. \u201cNate and I have a deal worked out. I think you\u2019ll like it. Two songs, nice compensation. Ray\u2019s jumping around like he\u2019s swallowed a grasshopper. Can you come sign this contract on Nate\u2019s tablet? If you\u2019re still up to doing this thing.\u201d</p><p>I took a breath. Up to it? \u201cI don\u2019t know about Ray, but I think that grasshopper\u2019s doing its thing in my stomach. Give me your honest opinion, Rafe. Did I sound okay? Or will I be making a fool of myself?\u201d I leaned against the wall, my knees suddenly Jell-O. My mother must have done a calming spell on me because now that she\u2019d left, I was trembling again.</p><p>\u201cOkay? Blondie, you were dynamite.\u201d Rafe put his hands on my shoulders. He stared into my eyes. \u201cWe\u2019ve got no reason to lie. You\u2019ve got the pipes and Sienna\u2019s right. The heart. I felt the emotion when you sang the song. Even imagined for a few beats that it was me you were singing for. Then I kicked myself. Of course it was Blade you were picturing in your head. Love song. Am I right?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. I hated to hurt him but he knew the truth and it was old news. \u201cThanks, Rafe. Singing in public. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s freaking me out. If you think I\u2019ll be okay . . .\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMore than okay, babe. Come inside and look at the songs we\u2019re talking about.\u201d Ray stepped into the hall. He took in the scene but seemed to realize there was no romantic vibe to it. \u201cYou can pick the ones you\u2019re most comfortable with. Since you said you can read music, does that mean you can play an instrument?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never tried to sing for my supper, obviously, but played in a few girl bands, back when they were the thing. I can hold my own on the piano, guitar, trumpet in a pinch. But I\u2019m really rusty. It was a long time ago. Back in the fifties actually.\u201d I laughed when Ray suddenly hauled me inside.</p><p>\u201cAre you shittin\u2019 me? You\u2019re a musician?\u201d Ray couldn\u2019t shut his mouth, gaping at me, his hand in mine as he dragged me across the floor to the stage again.</p> <p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t look so surprised. I\u2019ve had plenty of time to learn quite a few things, you know. And I love music. Always have. Since I couldn\u2019t sing, I had to do something besides just sit around and listen.\u201d</p><p>He plunked me down on his piano bench. \u201cShow me. Here.\u201d He shoved a sheet of music in front of me. \u201cWe found some old tunes in the piano bench. Valdez says you like Broadway stuff. It\u2019s not what I\u2019d want for the showcase, but good enough for a demo here. Play a little of that.\u201d He turned around. \u201cHey, Sin, come give a listen. You\u2019re not going to believe this.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at the sheet music. It was an old show tune from a Broadway hit, the fifties classic Brigadoon. \u201cAlmost Like Being in Love\u201d was a song I knew very well. I didn\u2019t even have to look at the music. I\u2019d played it often for Jerry when we\u2019d had access to a piano. Anything Scottish did it for him. He had a great voice and he liked to sing to me. I\u2019d been forced to sit and listen, playing his accompanist and adoring fan. What a cool surprise if I could sing it for him when he came home. He had a piano in his house that had come furnished. We\u2019d been busy ever since we\u2019d gotten to Austin. Too busy for one of our musical evenings. And wasn\u2019t that an interesting thought. I loved Austin but it seemed like I\u2019d had a lot of problems since I\u2019d moved here. Jerry too.</p><p>I realized the room had gone completely still when I started playing the opening notes. I did a few flourishes just because I could. Sienna and Ray grinned and high-fived each other. They settled down again when I began to sing.</p><p>I imagined how Jerry and I could sing to each other like the two lovers had done in the play I\u2019d seen on Broadway when I\u2019d lived in New York decades ago. I did put my heart into the song. I always had. Music meant as much to me as it did to Ray and I was glad it showed. When I finished, everyone clapped and I ducked my head, embarrassed.</p> <p>I\u2019d gotten so carried away by the music, I\u2019d almost forgotten there was anyone else in the room. I hoped it would work that way Halloween. It would help me get through the performance in front of a crowd.</p><p>Ray laughed, sliding onto the bench next to me to go through a sheaf of other music. He was beside himself with my musical ability, talking a mile a minute about possible tunes. I wanted him to slow down and let me think. I had some ideas and needed to hit the Internet, to look up songs that might work with my own agenda. When I whispered a possible song title, Ray called Sienna over to discuss it with her, picking up his phone to find a demo on YouTube.</p><p>I glanced up and saw Aggie\u2019s sneer. She was furious. She mouthed, \u201cShow-off.\u201d I nodded and smiled, stroking the keys in a little musical taunt. Why not? If you\u2019ve got it, flaunt it. I should have known better.</p><p>Eleven</p><p>I woke up the next evening with my schedule buzzing in my brain. I would head to Ian\u2019s as soon as possible but I wasn\u2019t going to spend much time there. I had to hit my shop and check on inventory and see if I could scrounge up a costume for Halloween in case my mother didn\u2019t come through.</p><p>I didn\u2019t have time to worry about my new vampire and had left her in Danny\u2019s capable hands. He knew not to let her be alone with mortals and was strong enough to physically control her if she got a bad case of bloodlust. Still, I did need to check in on her. Of course I\u2019d see her at rehearsals. Another piece of my double-stuffed night.</p> <p>I rolled out of my comfy bed and smelled coffee. Yes, Valdez was in the apartment and making his own meal. We needed to talk. Sure, she had some creepy creatures around her, but if Mel had bought the breakup story, then I could hope she would back off with the threats. At the very least, with her reputation to think about, the woman wouldn\u2019t come at me with an audience. I could see the headlines: \u201cLife coach melts down with own life in chaos.\u201d Talk about bad for business. Maybe Rafe didn\u2019t need to be around me as much as he thought he did. I slipped on a robe and walked into the living room. I wasn\u2019t prepared for the scene I interrupted.</p><p>Lacy and Valdez were stretched out on the couch and in each other\u2019s arms. Naked. Okay. I knew they were a couple but I really, really didn\u2019t want to see them making it. I turned on my heels and jogged back into the bedroom. Seriously, where were my bodyguard\u2019s shifter senses that he hadn\u2019t heard me wake up and come in? I could have been staked in my sleep. Voodooed to hell and gone and he\u2019d never have noticed. I slammed the bedroom door.</p><p>\u201cGlory?\u201d Rafe tapped on the door a minute later.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m busy.\u201d I got out my laptop. \u201cI have some research to do. Go on about your own business. Pretend I\u2019m not here. That\u2019s what you were doing anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He opened the door. He\u2019d pulled on a pair of jeans.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to see his bare chest, but it was way too fine to ignore. Lacy had been all over it. At least they hadn\u2019t been in cat form. The thought made me want to puke.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry. You have a life. I\u2019m glad. Tell Lacy I\u2019m okay with it. Go on, take care of your lady.\u201d I opened the laptop and turned it on, pulling a pillow under it for a cushion. I leaned back against the padded headboard. Nice. Maybe I\u2019d get one similar to it. Very comfortable. If I came into some extra money, I could redecorate. This bedroom was feminine in lavender and cream. Lily must have picked out everything. I typed in my password.</p><p>\u201cGlory, look at me.\u201d Rafe moved to the side of the bed. \u201cLacy\u2019s gone. She didn\u2019t like the way I threw her across the room when I realized you saw us together.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGee, Rafe. That was a little extreme. Is she all right?\u201d I looked again. How could I not? The way those jeans dipped low, the zipper not quite done up? Oh, God, but I remembered how we\u2019d been together . . . Shifter blood is so hot. And Rafe made love so fiercely. I dragged my eyes away when I saw heat flare in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a cat. She landed on her feet.\u201d He moved around the foot of the bed. \u201cWe\u2019ll be fine. She just needs time to cool off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSend her flowers.\u201d I relaxed, glad I hadn\u2019t ruined things for him.</p><p>\u201cLacy\u2019s not into flowers. If I can get hold of some bluefin tuna, she\u2019ll forget all about that interruption.\u201d He sat beside me on the bed, making the computer slide off my lap. \u201cYou okay? I was supposed to be guarding you. Won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d I bumped my shoulder against his arm. \u201cThis bodyguard thing has put a crimp in your social life. You and I have been done for a while now. I\u2019m glad you have someone. Lacy\u2019s nice.\u201d His hand was dark against the white sheets. I itched to pick it up. To prove I could and it wouldn\u2019t mean anything? That would be plain stupid.</p><p>\u201cYes, she is. I was lucky to find her. Can\u2019t say it\u2019s going anywhere long term but we\u2019re having fun.\u201d He grinned, like he was remembering that fun. Then he got serious again. \u201cYou know Blade showed me how much he loves you by swallowing his pride and feelings about us and asking me to take care of you. For the first time, I can see you two together and understand why you stick by him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. You\u2019re my best friend, Rafe. I want you two to get along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try. But when he starts ordering me around, you know I don\u2019t take it well.\u201d He kissed the top of my head. \u201cYou and I had better get going. I\u2019m showering while you do your research. Then I guess we hit Ian\u2019s first. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I leaned back. Rafe showering. I watched him stride to the bathroom. The bad boy dropped his jeans and kicked them away just before he hit the door. Reminding me of what I\u2019d given up? Of course.</p><p>I sighed and fell back on the bed. Lucky Lacy. If she played her cards right, she could have Rafe forever. The girl wasn\u2019t getting any younger and her mother had been dropping by the shop regularly lately, reminding her of that fact. Not that Mom-Cat wanted her daughter hooked up with a shifter. No, she had eligible were-cat males lined up. Lacy\u2019s affair with Rafe was probably her way of sticking it to her mother. I could relate to that.</p><p>I got comfy with the computer again. Music. I was very familiar with what Ray and Sienna considered retro. I\u2019d lived with that music. The fifties had been a fun time. I could go back a lot further but knew the rockers would be confused by it. It didn\u2019t take long for me to pick out two songs that I hoped would be crowd-pleasers on a Saturday night. I sent the links to Ray and Sin then got up and dressed, glad I\u2019d showered the night before. By the time Rafe was ready, I was good to go, the voodoo book and my laptop in my tote again.</p><p>The ride out to Ian\u2019s was fairly quiet after we made a stop at a twenty-four-hour copy center near the University of Texas. I wasn\u2019t about to just hand over a voodoo book to Ian MacDonald. Jerry\u2019s distrust of the man and my own experiences with him made me more than reluctant to do that. I told Rafe Ian had tried to talk me out of messing with voodoo.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right, Glory. I can turn around right now. Even that book gives me the creeps.\u201d Rafe was driving his SUV. It was one of those big black powerful cars that men liked. We could probably go off road if we had to. Rafe would enjoy that.</p><p>\u201cI want Mel to stay away from Jerry. If this potion will do the trick, then I have to try it.\u201d I\u2019d called Sienna before we\u2019d left and she\u2019d told me Aggie was with her, bragging that she hadn\u2019t bothered to go to work. I wondered what Ian would say about that. I didn\u2019t have long to wonder. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ian greeted us at the door. \u201cYour Siren sister didn\u2019t show up today, according to my guards. Know anything about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not my sister. And I\u2019m not Aggie\u2019s keeper either. I don\u2019t know what she did today.\u201d I walked in, Rafe close behind me.</p><p>\u201cDo I have to call the vampire council and tell them she\u2019s in breach of our contract?\u201d Ian closed the door. \u201cThey can throw her in the clink.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe coffin, you mean.\u201d I set my tote on Ian\u2019s massive glass coffee table. \u201cShe probably didn\u2019t show because she\u2019s starting a new job that pays enough to get you off her back. Guess she decided to quit here and send you a check every week. She should have notified you though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not how our agreement works.\u201d Ian stalked over to his bar and poured a drink. It was a synthetic blood with alcohol. \u201cWant one?\u201d He ignored Rafe. He had always treated my bodyguard like a piece of furniture, and nothing had changed.</p><p>\u201cSure. Why not? Rafe? I\u2019m sure Ian has something without blood.\u201d I was determined to nip this elitist attitude in the bud.</p><p>\u201cScotch if you have it.\u201d Rafe grinned, happy to goad Ian into treating him as a guest.</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell not?\u201d Ian pulled out a bottle of good Scot\u2019s whiskey. \u201cSeems the servants are determined to take over these days.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPour us all some of that, Ian. I learned in Scotland that vamps can drink it straight. As long as we don\u2019t get carried away. You\u2019re working with Bart O\u2019Connor. He told me you two hit it off. He\u2019s done experiments to prove a little can\u2019t hurt us.\u201d I smiled, happy to teach Ian something for a change.</p><p>\u201cYes. Sharp guy. He didn\u2019t mention this. Good to know.\u201d Ian filled three glasses, bringing one of them to me. \u201cDown the hatch.\u201d He clinked his glass against mine. Apparently Rafe was supposed to pick up his own from the bar. He didn\u2019t hesitate.</p><p>\u201cCheers.\u201d Rafe sipped. \u201cExcellent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s from my family\u2019s distillery. I just didn\u2019t think I could enjoy it again. Thanks, Gloriana.\u201d Ian took a drink, a look of satisfaction on his handsome face. \u201cWell, now. I guess I owe you some help with this potion. Show me that book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can look at it from there but I\u2019m not about to give it to you. I\u2019ve copied the page you\u2019ll need. You won\u2019t believe all the ingredients in this potion. Really weird ones too. I started a search on the Internet but finally gave up. They aren\u2019t things you\u2019ll find in a supermarket.\u201d I pulled the book out of my tote and held it up. \u201cThe recipe we need was marked with a slip of paper.\u201d I handed him the copy.</p><p>\u201cThis is ridiculous. Let me see the book, Gloriana. What do you think I\u2019ll do? Steal it?\u201d Ian snatched the copy but stayed close.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Ian. Wouldn\u2019t put it past you.\u201d I stuffed the book back in my tote. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t up to this, say so. I heard there are a few Energy Vampires setting up shop out at the old site. Maybe I can connect with them.\u201d</p><p>Ian frowned and glanced at the recipe in his hand. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t want them to get hold of something like this. You\u2019d never see it again.\u201d He sat in a leather chair and gestured for us to sit. \u201cI\u2019ll play by your silly rules. I have to admit you intrigued me with your phone call and here it is. Periplaneta americana.\u201d He grinned and looked up at me. \u201cHate to burst your bubble, Gloriana, but that\u2019s the common cockroach. You probably have one or two on hand yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Gross.\u201d I leaned forward. \u201cI should have looked that up. I\u2019d had such a hard time with the other stuff that I quit before I got to that. Anything else common there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Old Man\u2019s Beard is commonly referred to as tree moss. That\u2019s easy enough to find around here.\u201d Ian gestured to the French doors that led to his deck. It had a view of the lake and the woods surrounding it. \u201cAnd I\u2019d assume Mother Nature\u2019s Tears to be rainwater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t put that together.\u201d I felt like smacking my forehead. \u201cBut Ian, there are some exotic insects there too. I did find those on the Net.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I see. I\u2019ll have to check with my suppliers. I can have the bugs here tomorrow night if they are in stock.\u201d He stood. \u201cCome to my lab and let me see if I have everything else. You sure this keeps people away? It could be quite handy. Like a bug zapper for people.\u201d He looked distracted as he strode down the hall.</p><p>\u201cOnly without frying them.\u201d I hurried after him.</p><p>Rafe wasn\u2019t letting me out of his sight. \u201cBe careful, Glory. Remember what this guy has done in the past.\u201d He nodded to a guard stationed next to the lab door.</p> <p>\u201cI know. He\u2019s out for himself. Always. But if you\u2019ve got something he wants, you\u2019re golden. Right now, he\u2019s interested in me because I have Olympian powers.\u201d I smiled at Rafe before I followed Ian. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m always alert around him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d</p><p>Rafe and I glanced at each other then ran into the lab.</p><p>\u201cSir? Has there been an intrusion?\u201d The guard shouldered us aside, his gun out while he did a sweep of the room. He hurried to Ian\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cYou told me no one had been here today.\u201d Ian\u2019s face was flushed. Obviously the fact that he was holding two broken beakers in his bleeding hands had done that. The smell of his blood dripping to the floor brought my fangs down and probably flushed my face too.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened, Ian?\u201d I fought my fangs back where they belonged.</p><p>\u201cThompson, why don\u2019t you tell us?\u201d Ian threw the beakers to the tile floor where they shattered. \u201cWhat the hell happened here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, I don\u2019t know, sir. She said she\u2019d left something undone here. Just stayed a minute.\u201d Thompson backed toward the door when Ian snarled.</p><p>\u201cShe. I don\u2019t have to guess who she is. Were you fucking Aggie, Thompson? Is that how she persuaded you to let her into my lab? You and she both know this room is off-limits. To everyone!\u201d Ian\u2019s eyes bulged, a vein throbbed in his forehead and we all stepped back this time. I\u2019d never seen him so out of control. I pressed against Rafe in case Ian forgot we weren\u2019t the enemy.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, sir. She came in just this once. She needed to clean up a spill, she said. Claimed you\u2019d texted her about it. One last order before she quit.\u201d Thompson gasped when Ian grabbed his throat and threw him against the wall.</p><p>\u201cYou know I can read your stupid shifter mind, don\u2019t you?\u201d Ian thumped the man\u2019s head against the wall, making a hole in the Sheetrock. \u201cIdiot! She played you. I hope that blow job was worth it. You\u2019ve just lost your job and are a heartbeat away from losing your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIan, calm down!\u201d I tried to go to him but Rafe held me back. \u201cWhat happened here that set you off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay out of this, Glory.\u201d Ian didn\u2019t spare me a glance. \u201cObviously you have shit for brains, man, but hear me. If I find one single thing missing, you\u2019re dead. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir! I swear. She\u2019s a mortal and was only in here for a minute. What could she take? She didn\u2019t have on enough to hide anything.\u201d He choked, Ian\u2019s fist in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cOut of my sight!\u201d Ian threw him toward the door. \u201cDon\u2019t stop until you\u2019re out of the state, the country. If I see you again, you\u2019re a dead man.\u201d Ian paced the length of the room, picking up containers and sniffing them then flinging them to the tile floor.</p><p>\u201cDamn it to hell!\u201d Ian ranted as he went up and down each aisle, throwing things like a wild man. The room had hardly been disturbed before. Soon it was a complete disaster and reeking of strange and very unpleasant odors.</p><p>\u201cIan! Tell us. What happened? What did Aggie do?\u201d I didn\u2019t dare approach him. He finally stopped in front of a glass-fronted case filled with notebooks and glass bottles. It was locked. He sighed when he realized the lock hadn\u2019t been broken.</p><p>\u201cThat bitch contaminated every experiment I had going. Bleach. She poured common household bleach into everything.\u201d He swept his arm across a table full of test tubes in metal holders. They all crashed to the floor. The smell was so overpowering I quit breathing altogether. \u201cYou realize how much work that represented? How much money?\u201d His voice rose and trembled. I swear, if he\u2019d been a woman, he would\u2019ve been sobbing. Instead, he hit the metal tabletop until his fist bled.</p><p>\u201cAggie hated him this much?\u201d Rafe whispered.</p><p>\u201cOf course she did. That cursed Siren. She knew just how to pay me back for making her work for once in her useless life. Thank God I keep my computer locked in my office or she\u2019d have dumped bleach on it too.\u201d Ian kicked over a table. It slid into another one and started a chain reaction. \u201cEllis, Desmond, Cox! Get the fuck in here!\u201d</p><p>Three men ran into the room. Why they hadn\u2019t already come when the crashes started I couldn\u2019t imagine. Unless they were used to Ian\u2019s temper fits and had instructions to ignore loud noises until called. Whatever. They focused on Ian, who still looked totally out of his mind.</p><p>\u201cSir?\u201d Ellis took the lead. \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, get a crew and have this room completely emptied and scrubbed down. I want everything replaced. Brand-new equipment. By tomorrow night. I\u2019ll have to start all my experiments over again. No one is to touch this cabinet.\u201d He pointed to the locked one behind him. \u201cI expect you to oversee this personally. Is that clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. Do you have a list of what you need?\u201d Ellis whispered to the other two men and they started carrying out the tables.</p><p>\u201cIt will be in your e-mail by the end of the night.\u201d Ian strode over to me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Gloriana. I\u2019ll work on your potion tomorrow night. I swear it. It will be a good distraction from this.\u201d He swept his arm toward the chaos he\u2019d created. \u201cNow I need to go.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWait.\u201d I grabbed his arm. \u201cWhere are you going? What are you going to do, Ian?\u201d I was afraid I knew.</p><p>\u201cFind that bitch and kill her. What did you think?\u201d His fangs were down and I knew he meant it.</p><p>\u201cStop. No.\u201d I searched for the right words. Were there any? \u201cShe\u2019s simply not worth it.\u201d I held on to him. He was shaking with rage. \u201cShe\u2019s a mortal, suffering because she\u2019ll grow old and has no powers. Let that be her punishment. She\u2019s broke too. I\u2019m kicking her out of my apartment tonight.\u201d I glanced around at the destruction. \u201cThis is the last straw. Yep, she\u2019s gone. As soon as I leave here. So she\u2019ll be homeless.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe whore will find another bed. One with some unsuspecting man no doubt. Let me go, Glory. She\u2019s gone too far.\u201d Ian kicked a beaker aside. \u201cFuck! This is my life\u2019s work. You have no idea what she\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. It\u2019s important work too. But she did this to get a rise out of you, Ian. Do you really want her to see how hurt you are?\u201d I touched his shoulder. Surprise. He was trembling. Aggie had definitely found his vulnerability.</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m hurt?\u201d Ian tried to shrug away from me but I wouldn\u2019t let go, just gripped his arm instead. He wasn\u2019t about to admit to such a weak emotion. \u201cI\u2019m pissed. Furious. And determined to make the bitch pay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. But if you let her see you like this, she\u2019ll revel in how she affected you.\u201d I stood between Ian and the door.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right. Mine will be the last face she sees.\u201d Ian looked like he was prepared to drag me to the door. Rafe stepped closer. I couldn\u2019t let it become a battle. Especially since the men working to clear the room were paying attention to our conversation and had only one loyalty and it wasn\u2019t to me.</p> <p>\u201cSeriously, Ian? Why not make her think this stunt didn\u2019t even make a ripple in your world? She\u2019s beneath contempt.\u201d</p><p>Ian did pull me out of the room then, but gently. He was stronger than I was, older by centuries. Rafe kept his eyes on us, ready to intervene if he thought Ian was hurting me. When we got to the living room, Ian stopped and faced me. I guess he didn\u2019t like having his bodyguards as witnesses to his pain.</p><p>\u201cPretend this didn\u2019t matter?\u201d He ground his teeth. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough, Glory. My work is my life. And she betrayed me. Made me think that I loved her with her Siren magic. She made a fool of me. I\u2019ll never forgive her for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut then you made a fool of her. Let her believe that you\u2019d turn her vampire. Like you\u2019d ever meant to do that.\u201d I smiled. \u201cWhat did you call it? Pillow talk. She told me you were the best lover she ever had. That you talked her into your bed, promised her eternity, then used her, just like she\u2019d planned to use you. I saw how that devastated her. How she hated working here. No wonder she acted out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did hate the housekeeping. Bitched about it enough. Not to me. I wouldn\u2019t see her. But I got reports.\u201d Ian was at least listening to me now. \u201cSo she\u2019s been crying on your shoulder? How about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. She\u2019s so desperate to get away from here, she\u2019s trying to sing for a living.\u201d I glanced at Rafe. \u201cAsk Valdez. He was there. Aggie got the job but was humiliated. She has to work as a backup singer for a band. Backup. When she expected to be a star. Fat chance of that. The bitch can\u2019t even read music.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally. I\u2019d like to see Aggie humiliated.\u201d Ian walked over to the French doors to stare out into the night.</p><p>\u201cGood. Come with us Halloween night. She\u2019ll be singing at N-V. You can enjoy the show and let her see how little her idea of revenge affected you.\u201d I could see that he\u2019d calmed down. He was thinking, not just reacting.</p><p>\u201cGlory\u2019s making her stage debut too. Showing off her voice. She got it back, courtesy of her mother.\u201d Rafe finally relaxed and finished the drink Ian had poured him earlier. I picked up mine.</p><p>\u201cReally? Hebe gave you your singing voice back?\u201d Ian turned, looking intrigued. \u201cI\u2019d like to hear you, Glory. And Aggie is just doing some kind of doo-wop in the background?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for me, for Israel Caine and Sienna Star. Come to N-V and hear for yourself. Rafe has a table reserved for vampires. If you can stand to sit with Jerry, you can be part of the party.\u201d I crossed my fingers that Jer would be back by then.</p><p>\u201cAll right, Gloriana, relax. You\u2019ve talked me down. For now.\u201d Ian patted my arm. \u201cI know what you were doing and it worked. I won\u2019t kill her. Yet. But I will have payback. You have no idea what those experiments meant to me. Years of work. With the possibility that vampires could walk in the sun for hours at a time. Eat whatever they wished.\u201d He sighed. \u201cShit. I may cry yet.\u201d</p><p>I squeezed his hand, actually sorry for him. \u201cDon\u2019t cry, don\u2019t kill, get even. We\u2019ll think of something.\u201d</p><p>Ian nodded, definitely thinking and planning. Which was almost as scary as his murderous rage. Rafe and I said our good-byes and got out of there. We were in the car on our way back to the city when my cell phone rang. Jerry. Finally.</p> <p>\u201cAre you in Florida?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It was a long trip but I made it safely. I found Mel\u2019s sister. I\u2019m going to talk to her later tonight.\u201d Jerry sounded tired.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope she has some ideas about how we can make Mel give up on you.\u201d I wished I could touch him, make him feel better.</p><p>\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t say much on the phone. She wants to meet me. Meet Mel\u2019s latest crush. Apparently Mel has quite a history with the men in her life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring her back to Austin if you have to. But I\u2019m anxious to see you again and get this whole Mel thing behind us.\u201d I tried to imagine a future without that woman and her threats hanging over us and couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if this sister, Alexandra, is into voodoo or not. But I\u2019ll see what I can get from her to help us. Any luck with that book of spells you ordered? You know I\u2019m not in favor of you trying your hand at any of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It scares me too. It\u2019s a last resort. I just left a recipe for the potion at Ian\u2019s.\u201d I told him about Aggie\u2019s latest trick and my determination to kick her out of my place.</p><p>\u201cGood. She doesn\u2019t deserve a damn thing from you. I\u2019m glad you finally realize that.\u201d Jerry told me a few details about his trip but I could tell he was anxious to get off the phone.</p><p>\u201cCall me after you meet with the sister. I love you.\u201d I smiled into the phone when he said it back then ended the call.</p><p>\u201cThere was a lot you didn\u2019t tell him,\u201d Rafe said as I stuffed the phone back in my purse.</p><p>\u201cI want the singing to be a surprise. And let\u2019s keep the seminar our secret. Hopefully we\u2019ll go, learn something and definitely convince Mel I\u2019ve moved on to you for good. What could go wrong?\u201d I shivered. I hate when I tempt fate like that.</p><p>Rafe didn\u2019t say anything but I knew he felt the same way. \u201cWhere to now? The shop or your place to see if Aggie\u2019s there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me check.\u201d I pulled out the phone again. I called my apartment and got voice mail. \u201cAggie, if you\u2019re there, pick up. I need to talk to you.\u201d I waited but no answer. \u201cI guess she\u2019s with Sienna. They probably had rehearsals. Or went down to the shop for costumes. Let\u2019s hit Vintage Vamp\u2019s. I need to do some costume shopping of my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t, darling.\u201d My mother materialized in the backseat and Rafe hit the brakes.</p><p>\u201cShit. Was that necessary?\u201d He looked around, checking for other cars. Luckily we were still on the back roads near Ian\u2019s and there was no traffic. \u201cDo that in town and you\u2019d have caused a wreck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d Mother clearly wasn\u2019t. \u201cGloriana, I\u2019ve found the most darling fifties dresses for you to choose from. I brought them to your shop and put them in that back room. You can wear what you want and sell the rest. See how I think of your benefit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mother!\u201d I patted her hand where she gripped my seat. \u201cThat\u2019s really very thoughtful.\u201d And unusual for her. I was waiting for her ulterior motive. What did she want?</p><p>\u201cDarling, you shouldn\u2019t be so skeptical. But I do have a plan. I was thinking. If your grandfather were to discover your existence, it would be helpful if I could prove your worth to him. He\u2019s a music lover, you see.\u201d She leaned back. \u201cHonestly, Valdez, could you drive a little faster? I\u2019m eager for my daughter to see those clothes. I outdid myself this time. It\u2019s not easy finding vintage designer dresses in mint condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d Rafe grinned and stepped on the gas.</p><p>I grabbed the armrest between our bucket seats. \u201cGo on, Mother. What\u2019s this plan?\u201d I was sure there was something I wouldn\u2019t like about it.</p><p>\u201cOh, relax. I was just thinking that I want to make a video of it, or maybe just an audio.\u201d She sighed. \u201cYou will insist on that figure.\u201d She waved her hand. \u201cAnyway, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll absolutely love your voice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, that\u2019s actually nice.\u201d I turned and smiled at her.</p><p>\u201cI do try. You see I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s going to be royally peeved at me for keeping you a secret all these years.\u201d She looked upward and lowered her voice. \u201cIt\u2019s been over a thousand, you know, counting your time in the Sirens. And Zeus really does hate a secret. Especially in the family. If he loses his temper . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will he do to you?\u201d Of course there was the question of what he\u2019d do to me.</p><p>\u201cStrip me of my powers. Make me a pariah. Sentence me to time in a really horrible place. I won\u2019t describe it. You\u2019d have nightmares.\u201d She shuddered.</p><p>\u201cVampires don\u2019t dream, Mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s another thing!\u201d She gripped my shoulder, suddenly way too close. \u201cWhen he finds out a child of his blood is one of those . . . Well, I can\u2019t imagine his reaction.\u201d She rested her forehead on the seat back. \u201cHis temper is legendary. He gets a hangnail? Volcanos erupt. Stubs his toe? Earthquakes. Why do you think dinosaurs are extinct? He caught one of his favorite mistresses in bed with a hobbit.\u201d She shuddered. \u201cYou don\u2019t see those creatures around now either, do you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUh, no.\u201d I glanced at Rafe, who was fighting a grin. \u201cI\u2019d just as soon stay a secret from him. But it makes me wonder why you\u2019re so determined to drag me up there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo many of the gods know about you already. The clock\u2019s ticking on this secret coming out. I really want to be the one to tell him. Not have him find out from someone else. If I didn\u2019t wield so much power, one of the men you met would have already tattled to him.\u201d Big dramatic slide as my mother collapsed on the leather seat. \u201cYou have no idea how tedious my life can be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a recommendation for my ever venturing up there. I\u2019ll do whatever I can to help you keep that secret.\u201d I saw that we were getting close to town. Ian lived in the boondocks because he liked his privacy.</p> <p>\u201cSo glad to hear you say that, darling. I may need you to be extra nice to one of the men I\u2019m afraid wants to cause trouble for me.\u201d Mother perked up. \u201cOh, we\u2019re almost there.\u201d She pulled out her compact and lipstick from a designer handbag. Tonight she was in a gray wool pencil skirt and white fuzzy sweater. She wore ropes of luminous freshwater pearls that set off the outfit perfectly. Her knee-high boots in gray suede made my mouth water.</p><p>I\u2019d dressed casually for Ian\u2019s in black slacks and a black cashmere sweater. My vintage red leather jacket was my pop of color. I didn\u2019t look bad, just not sophisticated like my mother did. She smiled as she stroked on red lipstick.</p><p>\u201cGloriana, I can give you an outfit just like this one. Or at least replace those boots. You\u2019ve scuffed the toe.\u201d She dropped the lipstick back into her purse. \u201cYes, I saw you kick that wall. I suppose you\u2019ve inherited your grandfather\u2019s temper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo tricks now, Mother. Let\u2019s just go see what you left for me in the back room.\u201d I already owed her too much. And she\u2019d added the worry about Zeus. Rafe pulled the car around to the alley and we all got out. No sign of Mel or her zombies. Yay!</p><p>\u201cReally, darling. My tricks give me great pleasure. It\u2019s my way of making up for my neglect, don\u2019t you know?\u201d She held my arm when I started to go inside. \u201cClose your eyes, Gloriana. Valdez, would you come with me?\u201d She smiled at him, turning on the charm. \u201cI might need your help.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGlory, you okay back here?\u201d He scanned the alley.</p><p>\u201cSure. It seems fine. Go. I\u2019ll scream if I need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, darling.\u201d My mother dragged him into the shop. \u201cI can\u2019t wait till you see my little surprise.\u201d</p><p>I heard screaming and very unladylike curses. Doors opening and closing. \u201cThere she is. That Aggie person. I know it must be short for aggravation. Don\u2019t let her slip out the front door, Valdez.\u201d My mother stuck her head out the back. \u201cStay there, Gloriana. There\u2019s been a slight delay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Aggie done now?\u201d I put my tote down on the ground. The book and computer inside made it heavy.</p><p>\u201cYou really don\u2019t want to know. I\u2019m handling this.\u201d She grimaced, her eyes flashing. \u201cHow you have tolerated that cow in your home is beyond my understanding.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m kicking her out tonight.\u201d I smiled at the thought.</p><p>\u201cGood to know. And high time. Wait here.\u201d She darted back inside.</p><p>I tapped my foot, hummed one of the songs I planned to sing and even tried out a few bars. The echo in the alley was pretty good and I was tempted to sing out loud. No, better not. This was going to be a surprise for that night and the fewer people who heard me ahead of time, the better. I sniffed the air, relieved that it still just smelled of the muffins cooking next door and the full Dumpster a few yards away. I leaned against the door. A scuffling noise, muffled shrieks and sobbing. Finally there was silence.</p><p>The back door opened and Rafe waved me in. \u201cAll clear. Brace yourself. Your mother does know how to plan a surprise.\u201d</p><p>Have I told you how I hate surprises?</p><p>Twelve</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I picked up my tote and stepped inside. The bathroom door was closed and I sensed someone in there. Aggie. Interesting. My mother stood in front of a dress rack that had been wheeled in from the shop. She was beaming.</p><p>\u201cVoila!\u201d She waved at the five dresses hanging on the rack.</p> <p>I gasped because they were so exquisite. One of the popular fashions from the fifties had been the smart cocktail dress. My mother had found five of the smartest. The first was a black velvet number with crystal beads in a floral design that ran from the heart-shaped bodice down to the ballet-length hem. I ran my hand over the material. It was deliciously soft. Silk velvet. I didn\u2019t think they even made it anymore.</p><p>\u201cMother!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love that one. You\u2019d look stunning in it. But then the blue is perfect too. See? It has a little bolero jacket. And matching hat with a veil. Veils are so mysterious and sexy.\u201d My mother pulled the second dress out and held it up.</p><p>\u201cThey are absolutely gorgeous. I can\u2019t imagine where you found them.\u201d I ran my hands over a purple and gray floral print silk which had its own petticoat. The full skirt would swish when I walked.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy, Gloriana. I raided the closets of some serious collectors. There is one in Barcelona who will die if she discovers that iridescent number is missing.\u201d She laughed. \u201cFoolish woman. She\u2019ll never know. She has all these amazing clothes in storage and never even looks at them.\u201d</p><p>I pulled out the dress she was talking about. The fabric actually changed colors, from pink to red to coral, when the light hit it.</p><p>\u201cI saved the best for last, darling. What do you think?\u201d She pulled one more dress from the rack. \u201cThis is the one I had to rescue from the clutches of that grasping creature currently shut inside the bathroom.\u201d My mother draped the dress over the worktable. \u201cYou\u2019re a vampire, Gloriana. Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s time you put those fangs to work? Kill the bitch. Or at least suck out so much of her blood that she\u2019s a prune, too ugly to step foot outside of these walls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother! For wearing a dress?\u201d I glanced at Rafe. He just stuck his hands in his pockets, not saying yea or nay. I had a feeling he wouldn\u2019t stop me if I decided to go for it. \u201cI don\u2019t kill mortals. Not unless I\u2019m defending myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at this dress and tell me you weren\u2019t attacked.\u201d My mother slammed her fist on the table. \u201cIt was perfect and that, that thing had the nerve to come into your private quarters and put this on her disgusting body. It didn\u2019t even fit her. So she pinned it. Pinned it! See the holes on the sides?\u201d I swear my mother was going to stroke out. \u201cI wanted to strike her dead but that might draw attention from someone upstairs.\u201d She sat down, her hands shaking as she straightened one of her ropes of pearls. \u201cI swear, Gloriana, I am quite beside myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that.\u201d I patted her shoulder then finally took a good look at the dress that had her so upset. This was the best of the lot. White velvet. Sticking holes in a vintage masterpiece like this was the equivalent of tossing paint thinner on a Picasso.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful, Mother.\u201d The full circle skirt was trimmed in\u2014brace yourself\u2014white fox. There was a fitted waist with a wide belt featuring a sparkling buckle. \u201cAre they\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cReal diamonds?\u201d My mother\u2019s laugh bordered on hysteria. \u201cOf course they are. This dress once belonged to a Scandinavian princess. She wore it to a winter solstice ball and then it was archived. I managed to get it from a museum storeroom.\u201d She fanned her face with a hanky. \u201cHonestly, Gloriana, the idea of that creature putting it against her sallow scaly skin . . . Well, she must pay. And this isn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s abused your hospitality. Think it over. Are you really such a doormat that you\u2019ll let her get away with this too?\u201d</p><p>Think it over. It didn\u2019t take long. The list of abuses was pretty long: Aggie wasting all my hot water while she took endless baths. Aggie lounging around on my couch complaining because I hadn\u2019t forked over enough of my hard-earned cash to buy her food I sure couldn\u2019t eat. Aggie making mess after mess that she couldn\u2019t be bothered to clean up, including that disaster in Ian\u2019s lab.</p><p>I examined the beautiful white dress closely. If she\u2019d managed to ruin this fabulous piece . . . Of course. Her favorite red lipstick smeared on the neckline.</p><p>I stalked over to jerk open the bathroom door. Aggie sat on the closed toilet lid wearing only a bra, panties and her last pair of Manolos.</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d I could barely spit out the words.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She tried to look innocent. \u201cThe dress was here. You said I could shop. I shopped.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed her arm and dragged her out of the bathroom, ignoring her yelp of pain. \u201cYou\u2019ve shopped here for the last time.\u201d I opened the back door and threw her into the alley. She stumbled but didn\u2019t fall. \u201cYou will never come into my shop again. Never step a foot into my apartment again. Whatever shit you left there will be dropped into the alley later tonight. I don\u2019t care where you sleep, where you live or if you live at all.\u201d I took a breath.</p><p>\u201cWhoa. Cool your jets, Glory. I made an honest mistake.\u201d Aggie looked past me at my mother. \u201cCome on, lady. I didn\u2019t mean anything by it. How was I to know it was a present for Glory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have taken advantage of my daughter\u2019s generous nature for the last time. She\u2019s done with you. Don\u2019t push your luck, Agony. If it were up to me, you\u2019d be dead on the ground right now.\u201d My mother slipped her arm around my waist. \u201cTake her down, Gloriana. She doesn\u2019t deserve to live.\u201d</p><p>Aggie backed up, shivering, tears running down her cheeks. \u201cYou can\u2019t do this. I\u2019m standing here in my underwear. It\u2019s cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the hell cares? I sure don\u2019t.\u201d I slammed the door in her face. My heart pounded. I really hoped I never saw her again. First my apartment, now my shop. Aggie acted like they were hers. Because I\u2019d let her. I needed to reread some of my self-help books on assertiveness. My mother was right. Doormat. When had I turned into one? But I was sure of one thing. Aggie had wiped her feet on me for the last time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWow. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen you this mad, Glory.\u201d Rafe picked up the dress from the table. \u201cWell, maybe I have. A time or two.\u201d He grinned and winked at me. \u201cAnyway, this would look great on you. You\u2019d be like a snow princess.\u201d He flushed.</p><p>\u201cThat was a nice compliment.\u201d My mother looked him over. \u201cYou may not be as disgusting as I thought, Valdez. Shift out of here and I might start to like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother, please. Don\u2019t ruin this.\u201d I refused to spare Aggie another thought, though she was beating on the back door and calling my name. Finally she stopped. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to try all of these on. We\u2019ll have a little fashion show. Wouldn\u2019t you like that?\u201d I took the white dress from Rafe and hung it back on the rack. With luck, the lipstick wouldn\u2019t show. I\u2019d save it for last.</p> <p>\u201cLove it. Valdez, perhaps you should make sure that female outside can\u2019t get into my daughter\u2019s apartment. A little bird told me she was busy at that doctor\u2019s place today. Sabotage. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she tried to do something like that to Gloriana.\u201d My mother seemed determined to get Rafe out of the room. I didn\u2019t argue. Checking on my place was a good idea.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m on it. I can start tossing her clothes out the back window. You two will be busy here awhile, won\u2019t you?\u201d Rafe pulled open the back door. \u201cNo sign of her. Which makes me wonder where she went.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be here. Go. Maybe the zombies got her. But if they were looking for brains to eat, they\u2019d go hungry. I don\u2019t think Aggie has any.\u201d I bit my lip. Suck it up, Glory. You are not worried about her. But old habits die hard. I had to wonder where she\u2019d gone without a purse or, um, clothes. Aggie was always enterprising. I tried to put her out of my mind as Rafe took off, making me promise to lock the door behind him. I stepped into the bathroom with the first dress. Beautiful clothes. Surely I could enjoy a few minutes with some of my favorite things.</p><p>I came out in the blue. My mother was zipping me up and exclaiming about the sad state of my underwear when the door from the shop banged open.</p><p>\u201cListen, lady. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re the freakin\u2019 queen of the Nile. Aggie and I are going to be late for rehearsal.\u201d Sienna stopped when she saw me. \u201cGlory. When did you get here? And wow. Love that dress.\u201d She saw the rack and her mouth fell open. \u201cSo this is where you keep the good stuff.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not for you.\u201d My mother inserted herself between Sienna and the clothes. \u201cThey are my gift to my daughter and wouldn\u2019t fit you anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Whatever. Where\u2019s Aggie? You dragged her back here a while ago.\u201d She glanced into the bathroom. \u201cI have her purse so she can\u2019t have gone far. And her clothes are in the dressing room out here. Surely she didn\u2019t take off in that fabulous dress. She was supposed to save it for Halloween.\u201d</p><p>My mother\u2019s smile gave me chills. \u201cAggie\u2019s gone. Gloriana threw her out. She never should have touched that dress. It was not for her either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Sienna turned to me. \u201cYou tossed her out? Without her clothes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did. You have no idea the crap she\u2019s pulled. The dress thing was the final straw. I\u2019ve had it with her.\u201d I refused to feel guilty. \u201cRafe checked the alley. She\u2019s not there so I assume she got help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope like hell you\u2019re right.\u201d Sienna stared at me like she didn\u2019t know me. I just stared back. I wasn\u2019t backing down or apologizing.</p> <p>\u201cGloriana could and should have done much worse, Miss Starkowski.\u201d My mother held on to my arm, in protective mode. \u201cI\u2019d recommend you watch yourself around that agitator. The woman is not to be trusted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, point taken. And it\u2019s Star. I left Starkowski behind a long time ago.\u201d Sienna moved to the back door. \u201cIs she in the apartment? Like her or not, she\u2019s my backup singer and we really need to get going. Ray\u2019s already called me twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not letting her back in there. Rafe\u2019s upstairs getting her things together. He\u2019ll be putting them in the alley as soon as he can.\u201d I slipped on the bolero jacket that matched the dress.</p><p>\u201cI love that color on you, Gloriana.\u201d My mother held the matching hat in her hand. \u201cBut hats can be a pain. What to do about your hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two are just going to stand there talking fashion when Aggie is out in the night, in her underwear?\u201d Sienna\u2019s voice rose. \u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you, Glory? I thought you were a nice person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven nice people can be pushed too far, Sienna.\u201d I faced her. \u201cMy mother\u2019s right. Aggie\u2019s a user. She\u2019s reckless and will stab you in the back if she gets a chance. And she just made a very dangerous enemy in Ian MacDonald.\u201d Not that Aggie cared. She\u2019d been eager to hurt Ian. My own anger was wearing off and I couldn\u2019t help worrying about the woman. A mortal in her underwear in an alley that had had more than its share of bad happenings?</p><p>\u201cShe and Ian were already enemies. She told me the whole story.\u201d Sienna gestured to Danny, who\u2019d been right behind her since she\u2019d stepped into the room. He\u2019d been the one to shut the door into the shop. Smart, since we didn\u2019t want my customers to hear this conversation. \u201cWill you at least help me look for her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I stepped back into the bathroom. \u201cWait a minute. I have to change clothes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGloriana, don\u2019t be foolish. You don\u2019t care what happens to that woman.\u201d My mother tried to keep me from closing the door. \u201cWe were having fun together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can try on the rest of the dresses another time, Mother. No one else will disturb them. I\u2019ll leave instructions with the clerks.\u201d I patted her shoulder before gently easing the door shut. Maybe Aggie deserved to be tossed out on her fanny, but I didn\u2019t want to become just like her, treating others with callous disregard. I threw on my clothes and led the group out to the alley. Rafe was already there, setting boxes of Aggie\u2019s things next to the back door.</p><p>\u201cAny sign of her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she didn\u2019t show up at the apartment.\u201d Rafe joined us. \u201cYou decided to help her now?\u201d</p><p>I stopped next to my car, glad it was still there. \u201cI don\u2019t know. She is just a mortal.\u201d I turned to Sienna. \u201cDo you have her purse with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, here.\u201d She handed it over.</p><p>I took out my extra set of car keys. I\u2019d let Aggie drive my car to Ian\u2019s. Had even paid for the extra gas. Doormat didn\u2019t begin to cover it. I didn\u2019t owe her all that help. But still a niggling worry about what would become of her now wouldn\u2019t go away.</p><p>\u201cAll right. I get it. We\u2019ll look around. But if we find her, it will just be to hand her a coat from one of her boxes.\u201d Rafe bumped against my shoulder. \u201cRight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. I\u2019m not backing down. She\u2019s out for good.\u201d</p><p>Sienna just walked off, calling Aggie\u2019s name as she headed toward one end of the alley and looked between cars. I stood where I was and sniffed the air.</p><p>\u201cRafe. Do you smell what I smell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVampire? Yes. It\u2019s familiar but I can\u2019t place it.\u201d He started toward the other end of the alley. \u201cStay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot on your life. You\u2019re right. Familiar and unique. I met the guy once. He\u2019s a rogue. Just the kind of vampire who\u2019d be happy to turn Aggie if she could come up with enough cash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely she wouldn\u2019t have arranged to meet him already. He charges big bucks and Aggie just started the band gig. What she gets for giving Sienna blood wouldn\u2019t cover a down payment.\u201d Rafe stopped at the entrance to the alley. \u201cHard to tell which way they went but I think Aggie must have been with him.\u201d</p><p>Sienna came running up behind us. \u201cDid you find her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly. But we have a lead. Did you give Aggie some money, Sin?\u201d I saw her face. Of course she had.</p><p>\u201cShe needed an advance. For something really important to her. I knew we could work out her musical issues so she\u2019d be able to stay with the band. I wanted to help her.\u201d Sienna frowned. \u201cYou don\u2019t know my real history, Glory, though obviously your mother has done some snooping. When I landed in L.A. as a teenager, I could have been in big trouble and, yeah, I was messed up for a while. But then I got lucky and met a musician who helped me out, kept me safe and got me started. Aggie just needed someone to believe in her. I figured it was my turn to give back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you had it rough, Sienna.\u201d I really was. \u201cBut Aggie\u2019s not you. She didn\u2019t tell you what she wanted the money for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It was a big secret. A surprise, she said. I made her swear she wasn\u2019t on drugs.\u201d Sienna bit her lip. \u201cYou think she made a fool of me, don\u2019t you? Damn it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not for drugs, if that makes you feel better.\u201d I glanced at Danny. He\u2019d been a silent witness to this. But it wasn\u2019t his job to interfere. As usual, his face didn\u2019t give anything away as to what he was thinking.</p><p>Sienna looked down the alley, staring into the darkness. \u201cJust tell me, what did she want the money for? Will I ever see her again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is just a guess, but here\u2019s what we think happened.\u201d I glanced at Rafe and he nodded. \u201cWe recognized a scent back here. It\u2019s a vamp who will do just about anything for money. I have a feeling Aggie had arranged to meet him to pay this guy to make her a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sienna\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cShe\u2019s already found one of those rogue vampires?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but it\u2019s illegal according to our local vampire council.\u201d I saw Danny nod. Guess he\u2019d brushed up on our vampire rules. Good for him. \u201cYou know how desperate Aggie was to become vampire. I bet when she got you alone she mentioned it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. She wanted me to turn her. Of course I didn\u2019t take her seriously. Talk is cheap, and what do I know about that stuff anyway?\u201d Sienna stroked a fang. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine . . .\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRemember how crazed she was about gaining immortality again? Tonight she trashed Ian\u2019s lab. One reason was because she\u2019s still furious that Ian reneged on his promise to turn her. She\u2019s been in a hurry to become vampire ever since she dropped out of the Siren system. So as soon as you gave her some cash, she must have arranged a meet for tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much do you think this guy charges? I didn\u2019t give her that much.\u201d Sienna looked around wildly. \u201cAnd what\u2019s she thinking? You don\u2019t recover from the change overnight. I can attest to that. We have obligations. Commitments. Shit!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis fee will be pretty high. I have a feeling Aggie probably thought she could give him a down payment and he\u2019d go ahead and make the change. Then she\u2019d work off the rest with her usual fast talking and\u201d\u2014I glanced at the guys\u2014\u201cyou know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRogues don\u2019t take sex in payment, Glory.\u201d Rafe shook his head. \u201cAggie may be in trouble. If she did meet Miguel, I\u2019m pretty sure of it. He was in N-V the other night. I warned him not to hang around. He\u2019s bad news. He\u2019s working for Lucky Carver now, collecting debts. When some of my paranormal customers or work crew see him, they take off. You don\u2019t want to mess with Miguel. He\u2019s a heavy-duty enforcer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think he\u2019ll hurt her? When he realizes she can\u2019t pay the whole freight?\u201d Sienna dug in her purse when her phone blasted out a shrill tune. \u201cMaybe this is her. I really am an easy touch. I bought her a phone too. She had it stuck in her bra. Said you do that sometimes, Glory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I shape-shift. Not all the time.\u201d I listened while Sienna answered. Obviously it was Ray again. Sienna told him she was on her way and didn\u2019t mention that Aggie would be a no-show. \u201cCall her now. See if she answers,\u201d I said when Sienna hung up.</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d She hit speed dial. \u201cAggie! Where are you? We\u2019re worried sick.\u201d She listened for a while. \u201cYes, her too.\u201d She handed the phone to me.</p><p>\u201cThis is Glory. Where are you, Aggie?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike you care.\u201d Her voice was hard. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Thanks for asking. Are my things in the alley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Rafe stuck everything in boxes. They\u2019re by the back door. He was going to toss them out the window, but took pity on you. I\u2019ll let him know you appreciate that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell. You both will pay for being so mean to me. Count on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know who you\u2019re with, Aggie. Not a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you. I can hang out with whoever I want to. Miguel and I have worked out a deal. None of your business, that\u2019s for sure. I\u2019ll send someone to pick up my stuff. There\u2019d better not be anything missing. Tell Sienna I\u2019ll meet her at N-V in a few minutes.\u201d She ended the call.</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess Aggie\u2019s not a vampire yet. She\u2019s meeting you at the club, Sienna. Let\u2019s go.\u201d Then I noticed my mother still by the door into the shop. Pouting. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo need to hurry. Ray and I are going to practice first. You can work with him after that.\u201d Sienna sighed. \u201cAggie really was using me, wasn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid so. She\u2019s pretty clever about figuring out angles. Just be on your guard. If she doesn\u2019t work out singing backup, fire her. She\u2019s not your responsibility and she does have a good voice. I\u2019m sure she can find other work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m not thinking straight, being a vampire now and all. It\u2019s a weird deal. Having to keep so many things secret. I hate it.\u201d She glanced at Danny. \u201cHe had to step between me and a couple of your customers tonight. My fangs were shooting down, sticking right out of my mouth. Embarrassing. But, God, their blood smelled so fine.\u201d She clutched my hand. \u201cWhat would it hurt to drink from one now and then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSienna, think. They\u2019d freak if you came at them, fangs down. You and I need to get together and I\u2019ll teach you how to wipe their minds. So if they do catch a glimpse of your vamp bloodlust, you can make them forget it.\u201d I smiled at Danny. \u201cGood job, Danny. You saved her butt.\u201d He just shrugged, his own smile barely a grimace.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we do need time together. Tonight was horrible. There\u2019s so much I haven\u2019t learned yet. The mirror thing.\u201d Sienna brushed at her hair. \u201cShit. It was insane the way I had to hop around your store to avoid the mirrors once I realized I didn\u2019t show up. At. All. If a mortal had seen that . . .\u201d She swiped at a tear that ran down her cheek. \u201cI\u2019m a freak, Glory. How do you stand it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA freak who\u2019ll live forever and look hot and young while doing it.\u201d I gave her a quick hug. \u201cCome on, Sienna, look at the positives. Or try to anyway. Don\u2019t most mortals have trouble with their singing voices when they get older? I know Ray worried about his. The weather affected it, smoke, lots of stuff. Not anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. That part\u2019s totally cool. But then I can\u2019t stay in the spotlight like that indefinitely, can I? Not without telling the world what I am.\u201d She frowned when she pushed away from me. \u201cIf I could just come out of the closet, I\u2019d be so on board with this.\u201d She squared her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cComing out of the closet is never happening. You know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d I stared into her eyes, willing her to take me seriously.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, yeah. I know. The big bad council wouldn\u2019t like it.\u201d She tossed her hair and, for a moment, looked just like Aggie at her defiant worst. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve got to run. Did I tell you Danny\u2019s teaching me how to shape-shift? We\u2019ve already done it a few times. It\u2019s majorly cool. We\u2019re going to fly to N-V right now. See ya there later.\u201d She smiled. \u201cWatch.\u201d She shifted into a bat. Clich\u00e9. Danny, in sympathy I guess, did the same and they took off.</p><p>\u201cI need to spend more time with her. Her attitude needs adjusting.\u201d I sighed and glanced at my mother again.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I noticed that.\u201d Rafe followed me to the back door. \u201cBut, as usual, you\u2019ve got a lot going on. Like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too softhearted, Gloriana.\u201d My mother took me by the shoulders. \u201cWhat do you care if that Aggravation lives or dies, freezes in her underpants or gets drained dry? Toughen up, darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Mother. I\u2019m a disgrace to a goddess from Olympus. Perhaps you should just wash your hands of me.\u201d I kissed her cheek. This made her gasp and her eyes watered.</p><p>\u201cDarling! Come inside. Try on just one more dress. I must see you in the black velvet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Just one more.\u201d I stroked it with a fingertip. \u201cYou know, Mother, if there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned about men in my years on Earth, it\u2019s that they love to feel something soft. Pushes their \u2018on\u2019 button.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, my dear, you are my daughter, aren\u2019t you?\u201d She actually pulled a hanky out of her clutch. \u201cThat dress just might be the one. Try it and see. I have the most cunning shoe and handbag collection too. I\u2019ll fetch it while you get dressed.\u201d</p><p>Rafe stepped closer as soon as my mother disappeared. \u201cYou\u2019re right. We\u2019re suckers for anything soft. Soft material, soft skin.\u201d He touched my cheek. \u201cSoft heart. Total turn-ons. But be careful, Blondie. Aggie isn\u2019t to be trusted and I\u2019m afraid I put your mother in the same category as that Siren. Manipulators. Beware. That\u2019s all I\u2019m sayin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I hear you.\u201d I sighed and leaned against his hand for just a moment. Tempting. And off-limits. I took the dress into the bathroom and pulled it on. Perfect. Yes, the others were spectacular in their own ways, but this dress fit the mood for the songs I\u2019d chosen. I imagined myself onstage, spotlight hitting the black velvet, beads sparkling and Ray at the keyboard. It would be a night I\u2019d never forget.</p><p>I shivered. What did they say? Like someone had walked over my grave.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>When I got to N-V, the first person I saw, leaning against the bar, was Miguel. My memory of him was pretty vivid. For one thing, he\u2019d been one of the most powerful vamps I\u2019d ever met. I\u2019d just learned how to freeze people when I\u2019d run up against him. He\u2019d assured me he knew how to thaw them out. Which made me wonder exactly what else he could be besides a vampire. Demon? Or, now that I knew that gods and goddesses had \u201caccidents\u201d aka children, could he have a little Olympus blood in him like I did?</p><p>Rafe was furious and went toward Miguel ready for a confrontation. I stopped him with a hand on his back.</p><p>\u201cStop and think. If he\u2019s with Aggie, I want to find out what their deal is. You throw him out and we\u2019ll learn zilch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told him to stay out of here.\u201d Rafe nodded toward the bathrooms. Sure enough, one of his waiters was headed for the break room, his head turned so Miguel couldn\u2019t see it. Debt issues? \u201cHe\u2019s bad for business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me talk to him.\u201d I rubbed Rafe\u2019s back. \u201cMaybe he\u2019ll agree to wait in the practice room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my place, Glory. And he\u2019s dangerous. I don\u2019t want you anywhere near him.\u201d Rafe grabbed my hand. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you wait in the practice room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can handle him, Rafe. Let me do this. You can watch us from over here. If he does something you don\u2019t like, come help me. And he\u2019s drinking, running up a bar tab. Can you really afford to turn away another paying customer?\u201d I saw Miguel smiling at us from across the room. Obviously he had heard every word and thought we were hilarious. For thinking that I could handle him or that either of us could? I didn\u2019t wait for Rafe to answer me, just headed over. The music was loud and had a sexy beat. I found myself strutting to it, shoulders back, hips swaying. Miguel\u2019s smile got broader and he raised his glass to me then downed his drink in a single swallow.</p><p>\u201cChica. Looking good. Can I buy you a drink?\u201d He pulled out the bar stool next to him.</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019ll have whatever you\u2019re having.\u201d I settled on the stool. I still wore all black under my red leather jacket. I slipped off the leather and let Miguel see that my black sweater had a low neckline. He noticed with a slow smile. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTwo top shelf tequila shots.\u201d He gestured to the bartender. \u201cAre you sure you can handle that, Gloriana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you can, I can.\u201d I lifted the small glass when it was set down next to me, determined to prove I was his equal or better. Stupid? Maybe. Time would tell. \u201cWhat shall we drink to? Powers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, I like that.\u201d He grinned and clinked his glass against mine. \u201cPowers. Yours, mine. May we never have to test them against each other.\u201d He tossed back his drink then watched me.</p> <p>I downed mine then gasped. Ooookay. I\u2019d never had one of those before. I didn\u2019t dare try to talk. I had a feeling I\u2019d just burned out my throat lining. I managed a grin, glad breathing was optional. My eyes watered and Miguel laughed.</p><p>\u201cLightweight.\u201d Miguel gestured and two more shots were set down on the bar.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d Rafe was between us. \u201cYou trying to get her drunk? Glory, you trying to kill yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou trying to piss me off?\u201d Miguel lost his smile.</p><p>\u201cStop. Rafe, I\u2019m fine.\u201d I picked up the tequila, said a quick prayer and tossed it off again. \u201cSee? Nothing to it. Now go away. I want to talk business with Miguel. Take care of your own. I see one of your guys waving at you from the stairs.\u201d I hadn\u2019t made that up. Rafe was always on call once he got to N-V. As for me, I was trying to act okay when I most definitely was not. My throat was on fire and the flames had spread to parts south. The warmth was welcome. The numbness that was taking over my face? Not so much.</p> <p>\u201cBusiness, chiquita? I can\u2019t wait.\u201d Miguel stared at Rafe. \u201cYou heard the lady. She is perfectly safe with me, shifter. Yes, I can read your mind. I have a woman to warm my bed later right upstairs. I think I can resist adding Gloriana to my little black book for now.\u201d He saluted Rafe with his glass then drank. \u201cAdios.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me if you need me, Glory. Someone will be watching you every minute.\u201d Rafe touched my cheek then strode off.</p><p>\u201cHe is very protective.\u201d Miguel stood. \u201cShall we get a table? More private and more . . . comfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Rafe\u2019s always taken good care of me.\u201d I followed Miguel to a table in the balcony. There wasn\u2019t a band tonight, just a disc jockey, and the place wasn\u2019t too crowded. We had our pick of tables and he chose one in a dark corner, away from mortals. He pulled out a chair for me and I collapsed into it.</p><p>He settled into a chair close by, his knee brushing mine under the table. \u201cNow what is this business you wish to discuss? See? I\u2019m being polite and not reading your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said once you could read past my blocks. Was that true?\u201d I leaned my face on my hand. It slipped off. Uh-oh. I was really not used to tequila.</p> <p>\u201cWant to test me? Go ahead. Think something and block your thoughts. Then we\u2019ll see if I can get it right.\u201d He leaned closer. \u201cI love games like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d I realized I was leaning toward him and jerked upright. \u201cI mean, here goes.\u201d I thought about Mel the voodoo woman and how much I hated her. \u201cOkay, what did I think about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is Mel? Voodoo? I can help you if this woman is troubling you.\u201d Miguel picked up my hand. \u201cI have some experience with the dark arts. They are very dangerous in the wrong hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. That was good. Let me try to break your block.\u201d I wiggled my fingers free. \u201cGo.\u201d I stared at him. My thoughts were fuzzy. Damned tequila. Suddenly I had a picture of him in a bed stretched out on top of white cotton sheets. He was naked and touching himself. \u201cHey! That\u2019s unnecessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you like what you saw?\u201d His grin was wicked.</p><p>\u201cI saw way too much.\u201d My head wobbled. \u201cIsrael Caine has a piercing there too. Does that prove I got through your block?\u201d</p><p>His grin was my answer. \u201cSo, you and Caine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a history. And it\u2019s none of your business.\u201d I shook my head and the room did a three-sixty. \u201cCan we stop with the games now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course, but I must say I\u2019m most impressed. Where did you get your powers?\u201d He stared into my eyes for a long moment then moved his dark gaze down to where my top stretched low over my breasts. \u201cThey are amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assume we\u2019re still talking about my powers.\u201d I pulled up my top, suddenly self-conscious. \u201cMy mother is a goddess from Olympus. Hebe. I just found that out recently. Discovered my powers too.\u201d I sighed. \u201cShe dumped me into the Siren system when I was a baby. It\u2019s a long story but I was a mere mortal when Jerry found me and turned me vampire a little more than four hundred years ago.\u201d Why was I blabbing my life story to this guy?</p><p>\u201cFascinating. We are much alike, with powerful parents.\u201d He traced a pattern on the back of my hand. \u201cI\u2019m descended from Mayan priests who were connected to gods that many claim may have come from Olympus too. You must ask your mother. Since we have some of the same powers, it might be so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMayans. About that end of the world thing . . .\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cPlease. Are you disappointed it didn\u2019t end?\u201d He squeezed my fingers. \u201cI am not and I\u2019ve heard enough of that prediction to last me three lifetimes. We are here now. You wanted to ask me something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout Aggie. What are you going to do with her? Besides use her to warm your bed. You going to turn her vampire?\u201d I snatched back my hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in the loan business. She wants to borrow a considerable sum. She had a small down payment, but it wasn\u2019t nearly enough. She needed collateral. Becoming a vampire is an expensive proposition. I don\u2019t take making a vampire child lightly, and I charge accordingly.\u201d He leaned back in his chair and crossed his long legs. He was tall, lean, and I flashed on that spectacular body I\u2019d glimpsed in his thoughts. Mayan. No wonder his looks were dark and exotic.</p><p>\u201cCollateral. What the hell does Aggie have for collateral, Miguel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer body, mi vida. What else?\u201d Miguel leaned forward, his dark eyes intense, the table practically vibrating between us. \u201cShe explained that she is a former Siren. I see value there. She wants the loan to pay me. It\u2019s a win/win.\u201d His grin was a slash of white in his dark face. \u201cI will be her sire. As my child, she can become an earner for me if I so desire.\u201d He laughed at what I was sure was my look of revulsion.</p><p>\u201cGloriana, you are too easy. You think I\u2019m a pimp?\u201d He stood and held out his hand. \u201cPerhaps I am. But let\u2019s go to this practice room and see how Aggie is doing, shall we?\u201d He pulled me out of my chair. I wobbled. \u201cNo more tequila for you, chica. You can\u2019t hold your liquor worth a damn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t.\u201d I followed him to the practice room. It wasn\u2019t easy. My steps weren\u2019t steady and my mind was spinning. How much of what Miguel had said was the truth and how much of it was just for shock value? I was afraid to find out.</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>Aggie was actually doing a decent job when we arrived at the practice room. She was singing harmony, quietly enough that Ray ignored her and Sienna threw her a smile over her shoulder. Rafe was waiting for us, his eyes on Miguel when we walked in.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Rafe grabbed my arm.</p><p>\u201cSure. Mickey and I had a little chat.\u201d The room was swaying to the music. No, maybe I was.</p><p>\u201cSit down, you\u2019re loaded.\u201d Rafe shoved me into a chair. \u201cWhat did you do, Miguel, buy her another round?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe likes tequila, Valdez. But I would think a descendent of a goddess could hold her liquor. Es verdad?\u201d Miguel\u2019s smile didn\u2019t reach his eyes. \u201cThis music isn\u2019t what I expected. Loud rock and roll?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think Aggie was backing up chamber music, Miguel?\u201d I giggled at the thought. Oops, Rafe was right. I was more than a little tipsy. I\u2019d enjoyed another couple of tequila shots at the table. It had been a novelty and the liquor had quit burning my throat, the heat in my stomach welcome.</p><p>\u201cShe has a beautiful voice, chica. But you can barely hear her for the noise of the band and those other two singers.\u201d Miguel was frowning. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the best use of her talent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s being paid well, man. Besides working to pay her debt to MacDonald, it\u2019s the first money she\u2019s ever earned that didn\u2019t end with a kill.\u201d Rafe pulled up another chair. \u201cThose other two singers are the stars who sign her paycheck. We should shut up and let them finish rehearsal before they kick us out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d she get the clothes?\u201d I couldn\u2019t stay quiet, still focused on Aggie. The last time I\u2019d seen her she\u2019d been in her underwear. \u201cYou keep stuff like that in your closet, Miguel?\u201d I wagged a finger at him. \u201cDo a little cross-dressing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think they would fit me, chica?\u201d He pulled up a chair too. When he sat his knees brushed mine.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I looked him up and down, almost falling over. I steadied myself with a hand on his hard thigh. \u201cYou\u2019re way bigger than she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlory, get hold of yourself.\u201d Rafe jerked my chair closer to his and whispered in my ear. \u201cDamn it, if we weren\u2019t surrounded by Ray\u2019s mortal band members, I\u2019d make you drink from my wrist just to sober you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmm. Hot shifter blood. Yummy.\u201d I licked my lips, the very idea sending my fangs down. \u201cGimme.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. I\u2019m taking you out of here.\u201d Rafe jerked me up out of my chair.</p><p>\u201cStop. That hurt.\u201d I rubbed my wrist when he let me go. He was right, I was bombed and out of control. I glanced at the band. They couldn\u2019t hear us over the song they were about to finish. Good thing.</p><p>I put my hand over my mouth. Two reasons: One, my fangs just wouldn\u2019t retract. Two, I thought I was about to hurl.</p><p>\u201cYes, take her away and hurry. She\u2019s going to be sick.\u201d Miguel laughed. \u201cNot a drinker, are you, Gloriana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s not.\u201d Rafe put his arm around me. \u201cThere\u2019s a bathroom around the corner. Come on, sweetheart.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not your sweetheart.\u201d To my horror, tears filled my eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ve moved on. I\u2019m g-g-glad.\u201d I sniffled and wiped my cheeks with a shaky hand. \u201cOh, run, I\u2019m going to throw up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m running.\u201d Rafe hustled me to the unisex bathroom, threw open the door and held me while I barfed up my toenails. When there wasn\u2019t anything left in my stomach, I stood and wobbled over to the sink. Rafe wet a paper towel and I wiped my face. Then he waited patiently for me to rinse out my mouth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Rafe. That was disgusting.\u201d I leaned against the counter, trying to wipe away more of what I was sure was the mess I\u2019d made of my makeup.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I blame Miguel. What\u2019s the bastard\u2019s last name anyway?\u201d He took the paper towel from me and cleaned off mascara from under my eyes. \u201cThere. Can\u2019t have you running around with raccoon eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I sighed. \u201cIf he has a last name, he hasn\u2019t shared it with me. Where\u2019s my purse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d Miguel stood in the doorway. \u201cAnd my last name is Cisneros this century. Not that my name will help you in an Internet search. We\u2019re off the grid, all of us, are we not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sure.\u201d I took my purse and pulled out a hairbrush. I went to work, finding my lipstick and compact too. \u201cBut thanks for telling us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be working together. It\u2019s a courtesy.\u201d He walked away.</p> <p>\u201cWorking together? What the hell does that mean?\u201d Rafe snatched the lipstick out of my hand. \u201cDid you agree to something, Glory? With this guy?\u201d</p><p>I pressed a hand to my forehead. Had I? The tequila haze was gone but I had a blank spot from my time with Miguel. I remembered that he\u2019d asked me to check Olympus for his possible parentage. Was that it?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Rafe. I can\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you two through in here? Mortals actually use a bathroom.\u201d Aggie stood in the doorway, tapping her foot. New shoes. Not Manolos but good quality. Miguel was really investing in her. Why? I didn\u2019t trust him. Rafe and I agreed on that.</p><p>\u201cGet in here.\u201d I stepped out of the way and Aggie hurried inside.</p><p>\u201cUh, privacy?\u201d She hesitated before she closed the door on my foot.</p> <p>Rafe and I exchanged glances. I moved so she could shut the door and lock it.</p><p>\u201cHumility? I don\u2019t believe it.\u201d He leaned a shoulder against the wall. \u201cAre we waiting for her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I want to ask her a few questions.\u201d I dropped my purse on the floor, suddenly too weak to carry it. \u201cI feel like shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay away from tequila. I can\u2019t believe you even went there.\u201d Rafe shook his head. \u201cYou think Miguel did some kind of mind control on you? If he did, I\u2019m taking that bastard apart.\u201d</p><p>I rubbed my forehead, a memory teasingly close. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have to, Rafe. I was just too wrecked to remember. Let\u2019s see what he says. Business. He did ask me to check with Mother about something. That could be all he meant.\u201d I jumped when I heard the lock turn. \u201cHere she comes. Let me handle this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Aggie came out ready for a confrontation. The humility had been a temporary thing.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you have going with Miguel? He buy you that dress, those shoes?\u201d I blocked her with my arm when she started to flounce off without answering. \u201cSpill, Aggie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t owe you any explanations. You tossed me out like so much garbage. If he hadn\u2019t happened along, I\u2019d be sick with pneumonia or worse from exposure. And I don\u2019t heal in my sleep like some people. Yet.\u201d She tried to move around me. Rafe stepped in front of her.</p> <p>\u201cAnswer her, Aggie. Glory took you in when nobody else would. You do owe her. Maybe it\u2019s stupid, but Glory\u2019s worried about you. Miguel\u2019s a dangerous character. And we know he didn\u2019t just \u2018happen\u2019 along.\u201d Rafe smiled at me. \u201cGlo\u2019s got a soft heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore like a soft head. What\u2019s with you, Glory? One minute you\u2019re done with me, now you want to check up on me?\u201d Aggie lifted her chin. \u201cMiguel and I made a deal. I\u2019m his blood donor and he\u2019s loaning me some cash to get started, before I get paid for this gig.\u201d She smoothed down the green wool skirt that matched her sweater. \u201cHe even ran out and bought me this to wear tonight. Lucky thing a little boutique was open late. This is new, not used.\u201d Her smirk said what she thought of my shop.</p><p>I looked her over. \u201cYeah, lucky. An expensive boutique that also carried shoes. Just wait till you get the bill.\u201d I wanted to shake her, standing there so clueless. \u201cYou have any idea what his interest rates are? He works for one of the worst loan sharks in the paranormal world.\u201d</p><p>Aggie smiled, suddenly worldly wise in a way I never would be. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ve got my own way of paying off the interest, Glo.\u201d She laughed when Rafe made a noise which I took for disgust. \u201cLook at her, Rafe. She\u2019s blushing. You forget, Glory, I\u2019m used to trading my body for what I want. It\u2019s no big deal. The man\u2019s hot too. That\u2019s a bonus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAggie, where\u2019s your self-respect?\u201d I had to say it.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t afford that kind of high and mighty crap. Besides, Miguel\u2019s going to turn me vampire. His price for that is way more than I can come up with, but somehow I\u2019m going to make it happen.\u201d She tossed her hair, still sure she was a sex symbol. And maybe most men agreed. I didn\u2019t see it.</p><p>\u201cEarth to Aggie. Never trust a rogue vampire. You\u2019re over your head here.\u201d I wanted to slap some sense into her. Of course slapping Aggie would be fun anyway. She was getting on my last tequila-soaked nerve, especially when my head ached and her blood smelled like heaven on the hoof.</p><p>\u201cNot even close.\u201d Aggie stepped back from me. Obviously she\u2019d learned to recognize the signs of hunger in a vampire. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure the more I please him, the better deal he\u2019ll give me. Or, here\u2019s a thought, maybe he\u2019ll get carried away some night. Then he\u2019ll have no choice but to turn me. How\u2019s that for a plan?\u201d She smiled, sure of her sexual prowess. And why wouldn\u2019t she be? The woman had thousands of years of experience. My stomach cramped but I was too empty to throw up again.</p><p>Rafe had heard enough. \u201cHe\u2019d have a choice, you idiot. He could let you die. Sorry if this hurts you, Glory, but I\u2019ve known too many vampires who\u2019d suck her dry and not give a rat\u2019s ass about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re right, Rafe. I\u2019ve known plenty like that too. And I have a feeling Miguel is one of them. He has two jobs, Aggie. The other is hit man. He snuffs out life without a qualm. Kind of like you used to do.\u201d I tried to catch Aggie\u2019s eye but she was too smart for that. She\u2019d been mesmerized before and was obviously afraid that was my intention.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well. Maybe that makes him the perfect man for me.\u201d She smiled, completely immune to our warnings.</p><p>\u201cJust be careful, Aggie. Being a vampire\u2019s blood slave\u2014and that\u2019s what you are, make no mistake about it\u2014is dangerous. If Miguel accidentally lets you bleed out, he\u2019ll dump you like trash, for real this time.\u201d I let the wall hold me up, truly queasy again.</p><p>\u201cGloriana, you wound me.\u201d Miguel suddenly appeared in the hallway. \u201cI\u2019m very careful with my, as you crudely call them, blood slaves.\u201d His smile was pure predator. \u201cIt\u2019s so difficult to find a donor who is healthy, willing and beautiful.\u201d He pulled Aggie to him. \u201cAggie is exceptional.\u201d He frowned. \u201cAggie. I do not like this name. It\u2019s ugly. We will pick a new one for her. A stage name. Stay tuned.\u201d</p><p>Aggie leaned against him, practically purring. \u201cSee? Miguel appreciates me. I can spare a little of my juice and he treats me well. Buys me decent clothes and he has a nice house in the hills. Right, baby?\u201d</p><p>Miguel brushed back her hair, then tightened his hand in the strands so that we could see he was exerting pressure. \u201cI am nobody\u2019s baby. Respect, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, sure.\u201d Aggie\u2019s eyes widened and we saw her swallow. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Miguel. Rehearsal\u2019s over. If I\u2019m going to feed you later, I need to eat now. Okay?\u201d Her voice trembled.</p><p>\u201cFine. Red meat and perhaps a glass of red wine. There\u2019s a nice restaurant down the street that serves a late dinner.\u201d He released her hair, smoothing it down over her shoulder. \u201cAdios, Gloriana, Valdez. I will speak to you tomorrow night, Gloriana, about our deal. We can meet here again, I suppose. These rehearsals continue.\u201d His glance at the practice room made me wonder for how long.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll have to be late. I have an appointment early in the evening. Make it after midnight.\u201d I saw him nod. Then he pushed Aggie ahead of him down the hall, his hand firmly on her elbow. \u201cI hope Aggie knows what she\u2019s doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s probably happier with him than scrubbing Ian\u2019s toilets. Let it go, Glory.\u201d Rafe pointed toward the practice room. \u201cI think Ray\u2019s ready for you. Sienna\u2019s just come out and is gesturing at us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d I really shouldn\u2019t have tried the tequila. Now I\u2019d have to sing with a raw throat. Plus the liquor was still buzzing around inside my brain and doing cartwheels in my stomach. I hoped I remembered the words to the two songs I\u2019d picked.</p><p>Rafe and I passed the band on our way into the practice room. They\u2019d packed up and were heading out. The guys wished me luck and promised to stay for the next rehearsal so they could hear me sing. Sienna grinned and handed me sheet music.</p><p>\u201cI love your song choices. Perfect. Especially this last one. This is going to be a Halloween hit! I could even imagine hearing it on the radio.\u201d She hugged me. \u201cIs Blade going to be back by then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI certainly hope so.\u201d I glanced down at the music. \u201cI\u2019m glad the words are here. I\u2019m a little under the weather tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine. I wish I could stay but I have a radio interview scheduled. Good thing it was a late night show. I\u2019ll see you at home later.\u201d She waved then left. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Feeling like a condemned woman, I walked up onto the stage, where Ray was running through the first song. I pasted on a smile and fought back my nerves.</p><p>\u201cHey, Ray. What do you think of my song choices?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove \u2019em, babe. Let\u2019s work out your key first.\u201d He jumped up and kissed my cheek then we got down to business.</p> <p>Business. Yes, that\u2019s what this was. I\u2019d done a lot of stage work in the past but always in the chorus as a dancer or as part of a band. Now the spotlight would be on me. And singing. At least Ray was so utterly professional that he calmed me down. By the time we\u2019d run through one song a few times, I began to feel comfortable and it helped that Ray was full of compliments.</p><p>\u201cYou really think this will work? The song\u2019s pretty old-fashioned. N-V attracts a young, hip crowd.\u201d I still had some doubts about my choices.</p><p>\u201cRetro is in. Sienna was right about that. The college kids will get it and I think this vibe suits you. I just wish we could do a duet. Let\u2019s add a third number, something upbeat to start. Maybe a song you and I can sing to each other.\u201d He thought for a minute then played a tune that I recognized.</p><p>\u201cRay! That\u2019s perfect. I like the retro thing but it\u2019s good to mix in something more contemporary like that. You\u2019re a genius.\u201d I sat beside him at the piano. \u201cOf course this may get the paparazzi worked up again. Rumors flying that we\u2019re back together singing about \u2018sweet love.\u2019\u201d It might help Jerry convince Mel that he and I were through too. But I wasn\u2019t sharing that with Ray.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that chance. I can\u2019t wait to see the audience reaction.\u201d He started the song again and we worked on our harmony. Ray got really excited. \u201cThis needs the band behind it. Damn it, I have a notion to keep them onstage. Give you the full treatment.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Ray. That\u2019s a big commitment from the guys.\u201d I felt embarrassed. My first public performance as a singer. It was one thing to sing to Ray. Now he was talking about fronting the band. I still hadn\u2019t wrapped my head around that live audience, and it would be big with Israel Caine and Sienna Star on the bill.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll kill it, Glory. Never doubt it.\u201d He jumped up and hugged me. \u201cI wish your mother was here. I want to thank her. Damn, I can\u2019t believe she gave you your voice back! It\u2019s amazing.\u201d I swear he was about to tear up.</p><p>\u201cAt last someone appreciates me.\u201d My mother shimmered into view.</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Mother. Be careful. Did you check to see if any of the mortals were still around?\u201d I scanned the large room.</p><p>\u201cOf course, darling. All clear. Relax. I believe this handsome man is going to hug me.\u201d She laughed when Ray lunged off the stage and grabbed her, twirling her around the room.</p><p>\u201cDamn right, I am. Glory has a tremendous voice and you gave her back her instrument. I, for one, owe you a debt. Anything you want, lady, anytime.\u201d He set her down on her feet.</p> <p>\u201cRay, be careful. Mother can use that statement against you.\u201d I stepped off the stage. \u201cIt was just an expression, Mother, not a vow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. Your Israel Caine sounded very serious just then. Call me Hebe, Ray. That is what you said I should call you. I may hold you to that promise. If things need doing and you\u2019re the best man for the job.\u201d She smiled and patted his cheek. \u201cYou never know what might come up someday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlory, I meant it. This lady worked a miracle for you. Where\u2019s your gratitude?\u201d Ray picked up my hand. \u201cDid you hear her, Hebe? Her voice is incredible. I know it doesn\u2019t call men to her, like it did when she was a Siren, but it still stirs something in me. I said it before. She puts her heart into the music. Sienna and I see a real future for Glory on the stage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you want, Gloriana? A stage career?\u201d My mother pursed her lips. Tonight they wore a luscious shade of pink to compliment a deep purple velvet dress.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure yet. Let me survive my first performance and then ask that question.\u201d I rubbed my damp palms on my black jeans. I\u2019d shed my jacket and was all in black now. Purple. I should wear that color more often myself. It looked good on blondes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine. But I haven\u2019t forgotten my quest to get you in front of Zeus. Not sure how that will work if you pursue a public singing career.\u201d Mother tapped her chin. I\u2019d noticed it was a habit with her when she was thinking.</p><p>\u201cJust calm down. I\u2019m not going up to Olympus anytime soon. I have my own stuff going on down here now that I\u2019m not about to leave.\u201d I saw Rafe waving from the doorway with my purse in his hand. He held out my phone. \u201cLook. I have a phone call. I hope it\u2019s Jerry. Remember, he\u2019s my priority now.\u201d I saw my mother exchange looks with Ray. \u201cNo, you will not ask Ray to interfere in that relationship. No, no, no.\u201d I turned to Ray. \u201cJerry and I are solid. You do know that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Sorry, Hebe. I can\u2019t get into the middle of Glory\u2019s love life much as I\u2019d like to.\u201d Ray\u2019s smile was full of his usual charm. \u201cAsk me to do something else.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid I ask you to do anything at all yet?\u201d Mother held out her hands, the picture of innocence. \u201cReally, Gloriana, paranoia is very unbecoming. Go answer your phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I hurried across the hall. Rafe hadn\u2019t answered my phone but he must have heard it ring. I saw that I had voice mail. Two messages. One from Jerry and one from his sister. I listened to Cait\u2019s first. She and Bart were at Ian\u2019s helping him restart some of his research. Good. I felt guilty that I hadn\u2019t spared them a thought. Especially since I\u2019d promised Jerry I would keep his sister and her boyfriend entertained while he was gone. I called her back and made sure they were still occupied.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re fine. Bart is in his element, helping Ian with these experiments. I would like to see you sometime though, Glory. Tomorrow night?\u201d Caitlin sounded distracted. \u201cOh, good grief. Those two men are arguing about an experiment. I\u2019ll be glad to get away from here for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand. But I\u2019ve got a pretty full night tomorrow. How about Sunday? And next weekend, if you two are still here, is Halloween. That\u2019s a big deal in Austin. Lots of fun on Sixth Street. I\u2019ll, uh . . .\u201d I felt shy suddenly but plunged ahead. \u201cI\u2019ll be making my singing debut at N-V, a club here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Cait was surprised and I didn\u2019t blame her. For all she knew I still sang like I\u2019d been shocked with high voltage.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve got a new voice, courtesy of my mother. It\u2019s the singing voice I had as a Siren. Pretty awesome actually. I won\u2019t disgrace Jerry.\u201d I laughed. \u201cSeriously, I\u2019d love for you and Bart to come. The club owner is a friend and he can make sure you have good seats. He caters to vamps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that sounds great. Costumes?\u201d Cait laughed this time. \u201cYou had me going, chum. I was trying to figure out how to be diplomatic and beg you not to publicly humiliate yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can imagine. Good. I\u2019ll set you up. You remember Florence da Vinci?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Is she going to be there?\u201d</p><p>I realized I hadn\u2019t clued my best bud in on this new development. \u201cI bet she wouldn\u2019t miss it. I\u2019ll set all of you up in a big table on the balcony. Best seats in the house.\u201d I was aware that Rafe was within earshot. \u201cMore details later. Come by the shop on Sunday and we\u2019ll find you a cool costume. Call first because we\u2019re closed. But I\u2019ll meet you and open so we can pick out something. Think Bart will want one too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnowing him, he\u2019ll wear his plaid. The man doesn\u2019t travel without it.\u201d She said something to those quarreling men in the room with her. \u201cIan wants me to remind you that you already invited him to come too. Can you squeeze him in at our table?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d I could see this becoming a huge deal and my stomach turned. \u201cAnd Bart\u2019s plaid is perfect. Nothing sexier than a man in a kilt in my opinion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess my brother will be back by then and probably wear his as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so.\u201d I said something else, whatever was necessary to get off the phone, then ended the call.</p><p>\u201cSounds like we\u2019ll have every vampire in Austin on the balcony for your big debut.\u201d Rafe grinned at me. \u201cIs that nerves I\u2019m seeing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Just because my hands are shaking and I\u2019ve gnawed off half my cuticles, doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m nervous.\u201d I paced the room, glancing back to where my mother and Ray were getting way too cozy. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I can do this, Rafe. Sing in front of all those people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you can. Now go out in the hall and call Blade back. You\u2019ll feel better once you talk to him. Won\u2019t you?\u201d He smiled and gently pushed me out the door.</p><p>\u201cYes, I hope so. Especially if he says he\u2019s on the way home with some solutions to our problem.\u201d I smiled at Rafe. \u201cThanks. You\u2019ve gone above and beyond, as usual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy to help. I\u2019m keeping an eye on your mother. You think she has the hots for Caine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEww. Now I have that picture in my head.\u201d I slapped his arm then stepped into the hall and shut the door. I listened to the voice mail from Jerry first. He was clearly tired but excited when he said to call him as soon as I got the message. I hit speed dial and he answered on the second ring.</p><p>\u201cGlory. What are you doing?\u201d He sounded winded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m at rehearsals. I\u2019m going to sing, Jer. In public on Halloween. Can you believe it?\u201d I sat on the floor across from the door. It was so good to hear his voice. \u201cWhat did you find out? Where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way home. I have a plan, Glory. What\u2019s this about singing? At N-V?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere else? You mean you were flying when I called? Be careful answering so fast. You must have hit the ground hard.\u201d I pictured him shifting and answering in one swift motion. It was dangerous, out there in the dark, God knows where. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m okay, Gloriana. I just wanted to tell you what I found out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo tell me.\u201d I gripped the phone, praying he had a solution to get rid of Mel once and for all.</p><p>\u201cWell, her sister was a big help. Seems she disapproves of Mel\u2019s voodoo tricks. Is a little jealous of her success too, the whole inspirational talk thing, though I had to read her mind to get that from her. Anyway, she said Melisandra has a pattern with men. She gets tired of them quickly once she knows they are hers.\u201d I heard him swear.</p> <p>\u201cWhere are you? Did you fall? Hurt yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, just landed in some thorny bushes. I\u2019m fine. Did you hear what I said? Do you get the implications?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Mel likes the chase, but once she catches a guy she loses interest.\u201d I stared up at the ceiling. \u201cWhat\u2019s your plan? To come back and turn into her love slave?\u201d My phone cracked and I wiggled my fingers to loosen my grip. I couldn\u2019t afford a new phone right now.</p><p>\u201cNow, Gloriana, calm down. I can hear the tension in your voice.\u201d He coughed. \u201cDamn, I dropped into a swamp. Hang on.\u201d I heard water sloshing. \u201cThere, I\u2019m on dry land now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJerry, maybe you should call me back.\u201d I was trying not to dwell on the whole idea of Jerry convincing Mel he was hers.</p> <p>\u201cNo, let me tell you what I want to do. I\u2019ll come back and throw myself at Mel\u2019s feet. Tell her how desperately I missed her when I was in Miami.\u201d He slapped something. \u201cDamned mosquitos. And people call us bloodsuckers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you have sex with her? Seems like that would be the best way to convince her.\u201d The ceiling blurred but I blinked it into focus again.</p><p>\u201cNo. Absolutely not. I intend to mesmerize her, Gloriana. I know she\u2019s got powers, but her sister thinks that I can do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen mesmerize the bitch to quit loving you, Jer. That would solve all our problems.\u201d I was so frustrated I wanted to scream. A quick look around convinced me that wasn\u2019t a good idea. A waiter hurried into the practice room with a glass of synthetic for Ray. He glanced at me curiously.</p><p>\u201cYou know I can\u2019t do that. That\u2019s not how it works. We can mesmerize someone to forget they ate a piece of chocolate, but not that they love chocolate. Trust me, I\u2019ve tried with Mel already. She\u2019s wary of me. It\u2019s going to take some doing on my part. Alexandra gave me a potion to help get Mel to let down her guard with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this sister\u2019s a voodoo priestess too?\u201d What a family. \u201cWhy not a potion to get Mel to hate you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTrust me, I asked. No go. They\u2019re Haitian. But Alex practices voodoo in what she calls its pure form. None of the dark arts. Or so she says.\u201d More rustling. \u201cDamn that\u2019s a big snake. Not poisonous though. Anyway, she was sure that I could plant a suggestion in Mel\u2019s mind that we had sex when we didn\u2019t, especially if I could slip this potion into her meal beforehand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, kind of like how she drugged you, had her way with you and you didn\u2019t remember only in reverse?\u201d I was on my feet now. He sounded way too cozy with this Alex. Was she as beautiful as Mel? I wasn\u2019t about to ask. My black boots already had one scuff on the toe, another one wouldn\u2019t matter. I kicked the hell out of the wall. Too bad for the Sheetrock.</p><p>\u201cGloriana, that doesn\u2019t even make sense. There will be no sex. I swear it. I\u2019ll leave her in bed with false memories. She\u2019ll think I\u2019m her willing sex slave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave her in bed, Jerry. Oh, yeah. I\u2019m loving that picture.\u201d I had a feeling my phone was a goner. The floor was littered with pink rhinestones and I\u2019d lost a piece of plastic.</p><p>\u201cMy love, I swear nothing will happen. I\u2019ll tear out her throat first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Because I couldn\u2019t get near the bitch.\u201d I swallowed, my urge to cry about to take over.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t trust you. She lets me close, maybe because she wants to believe I return her feelings. If I declare my undying love . . . Hell, if I can\u2019t mesmerize her, I\u2019ll kill her and damn the consequences.\u201d His voice was firm.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s famous. The consequences will be many and messy.\u201d I was calming down.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s my last resort. Are you with me on this plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe plan sucks swamp water. But I guess it\u2019s all we have. I just want you safe, Jer. And back here with me.\u201d I heard my voice wobble. Shit.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I want too. Now about Halloween. You say that\u2019s when you\u2019re singing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Whoopee. Good to have something to look forward to. Caitie and Bart will be there. Maybe you can have Mel drag you along as her slave. Meet your sister. Hell, announce your engagement.\u201d Okay, so I was still mad about the whole thing. I kept picturing Jerry crawling into bed with that viper. He\u2019d have to kiss her, touch her or she wouldn\u2019t believe him. My stomach churned again. Tequila was off my menu forever.</p><p>\u201cCalm down, Gloriana. You know you\u2019re the only woman I love. But I\u2019ll do what it takes to end this and keep you safe. If I\u2019d so demean myself as to literally become her love slave, do you think Mel would still want me?\u201d His voice was low and determined.</p><p>\u201cI would. I\u2019d want you any way I could get you.\u201d I slid down the wall again. \u201cI don\u2019t like it, Jerry. You and that woman, together. She has all these tricks and potions. She could drug you again. Do . . . anything to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she could. But I plan to beat her to it. And why would she have to if I\u2019m offering myself to her willingly? Especially if she thinks you and I are through, Gloriana. She still thinks that, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so. I\u2019ll keep doing what I can on this end to make sure of it. It\u2019s the only thing I can do to help you now.\u201d I pressed a hand to my eyes. \u201cDamn it, Jerry. You\u2019d better sneak over to see me as soon as you get back. Any idea when that will be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLate tomorrow night. I have to stop soon for the sunrise and I\u2019m in Louisiana now. I have a safe house a couple of hours from here.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cAre you okay, Gloriana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure. Just trying to process this stupid plan. You have to know how much I hate it.\u201d I sighed.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Gloriana.\u201d His voice became husky. \u201cBelieve that, if you believe nothing else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay safe, Jer.\u201d I ended the call then barely restrained myself from throwing the phone across the hall. Playing as Mel\u2019s love slave? I sure as hell did hate the idea. This could not end well. The woman was too powerful.</p><p>At least tomorrow night I\u2019d have a chance to see if she truly believed Jerry and I were done. I struggled to my feet. Through the almost soundproof door, I heard Ray at the piano. Singing to my mother? I needed to get in there and break up that twosome.</p><p>Time to practice another song. I didn\u2019t have the heart for it. But if everything hinged on Halloween night, I\u2019d do it and make it the show of my long lifetime. For Jerry.</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>Saturday night Sienna, Rafe and I headed for the large auditorium, tickets in hand. I was ready to see Mel in her natural habitat as an inspirational speaker. Own the world. Really? Why not the universe?</p><p>\u201cGlory, you look a little tense. If I understand this situation correctly, you want this woman to believe you and Rafe are a couple. If so, then you\u2019d better loosen up a little instead of the current touch-me-and-die vibe you\u2019ve got going on.\u201d Sienna reached forward from the backseat of the SUV and tapped me lightly on the shoulder.</p><p>I laughed, caught out. She was right. I had to lighten up. Rafe was driving and I had my fists clenched in my lap. I\u2019d barely spoken since we\u2019d gotten in the car.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, guys. I haven\u2019t told you Jerry\u2019s plan yet. He\u2019s getting back tonight.\u201d I told them his idea for getting Mel to dump him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s crazy. He\u2019s taking a big chance that she\u2019ll follow her usual pattern. What if she decides he\u2019s the one man who could be a keeper?\u201d Rafe steered into the parking lot and into a vacant spot. We were early because I wanted to get a good seat, but the lot was already half-full.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need you to bring me down, Rafe. I\u2019ve got enough doubts of my own.\u201d I unbuckled my seat belt. \u201cThis might work. It\u2019s all we\u2019ve got for now anyway. What else can we do? Aggie destroyed Ian\u2019s lab. He was planning to work on making a potion to use against Mel. I doubt he\u2019ll come through with that now.\u201d I needed to check on the status of that. It still might come in handy if Mel did react differently than Jerry expected.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019ve known women who just like the chase. I say it\u2019s worth a shot. Some people just want the unattainable. Then once they\u2019ve got it, they move on. Kind of like I\u2019ve seen your friend Flo do with clothes, Glory. I swear she wears something once and then that\u2019s it for her.\u201d Sienna leaned between the seats again.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s about right.\u201d I turned to Rafe. \u201cSee? It\u2019s possible that\u2019s the way Mel is about men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it. But is Blade really going to be able to keep from having sex with her?\u201d He touched my hand. \u201cSorry, Glory, but you know he may have to go all the way to be convincing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right. If this woman\u2019s as powerful as you guys say she is, I don\u2019t see how he can avoid it.\u201d Sienna just had to add her two cents.</p><p>I jerked open my car door. \u201cI think we\u2019ve talked about this enough. Don\u2019t forget, Mel\u2019s mortal and Jerry\u2019s a powerful vampire. I trust him to make this work without sleeping with her. Okay?\u201d I wouldn\u2019t look at them, just hopped out of the SUV. \u201cComing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Sienna opened her own door. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s not my business anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I get it. You were just trying to help.\u201d I felt Rafe at my elbow.</p><p>\u201cCome on, we need to hear what the woman has to say. Glory claims she wants to become more ambitious. I say it\u2019s high time.\u201d He slammed my car door, then smiled. \u201cCan you look a little more excited, Glory? Tonight, you and I are a couple. Let\u2019s see if you can play that part with conviction.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI think I can manage.\u201d I twined my arms around his neck but stopped with just a kiss on his cheek. \u201cThanks, Rafe. You know just how to keep me on track.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so after all these years. Come on, ladies. I may learn something in there too.\u201d Rafe offered both elbows and we walked into the building like we were off to see the wizard. Inside, I slipped into an aisle seat not too far back with Rafe between Sienna and me.</p><p>There was a large stage up front as well as a podium. A picture of a spinning world, as taken from space, was showing on a big screen with Mel\u2019s catchphrase, \u201cOwn the World,\u201d printed in scarlet letters across it. We had a brochure on our seats which offered private sessions with Mel at a thousand bucks an hour. Or we could buy packages with tapes of different sessions she\u2019d conducted in the past. She even had a series on building a business from the ground up.</p> <p>\u201cShe must have a personal fortune. Look at these prices.\u201d Sienna stuffed the brochure in her purse. \u201cI would have to be really impressed to spring for any of this at that cost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding.\u201d I saw the auditorium was filling rapidly. There were several people in dark blue blazers with the world logo on the pocket\u2014who obviously worked for Mel\u2014helping people find seats. They were also doing sound checks and setting up some equipment on the stage. No sign of her zombie pals. I guess she kept her creepy creatures away from her regular business. Music played softly as the lights began to dim. It was a haunting tune, the kind you expected in an ashram or Indian temple.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me.\u201d A woman in her forties or fifties pushed her way into our row and plopped down on the other side of Sienna. \u201cOh, I\u2019m so excited. Have you been to one of Ms. Du Monde\u2019s lectures before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, no.\u201d I answered since no else seemed to be interested in picking up the conversation.</p><p>\u201cThis is my fifth one. Ms. Du Monde is so inspiring. I\u2019ve actually taken my business nationally now. I had a little start-up coffee bar before. Nothing great.\u201d She smiled at Rafe, who was suddenly paying attention. \u201cWell, after the first lecture, I got focused. Realized I was wasting my time, what with a Starbucks on every corner, you know?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, you\u2019re right about that. So what did you do?\u201d Rafe looked her over. She was attractive and he didn\u2019t mind the age thing, though, as an immortal, he\u2019d always look early thirties. I gave him an elbow and rubbed his thigh, reminding him we were supposed to be a couple.</p><p>\u201cI sprang for one of the private sessions with Ms. Du Monde. It was so enlightening!\u201d The woman lit up like a cheerleader at the playoff game. She dug in her purse and pressed business cards into Sienna\u2019s hand, Rafe\u2019s, and even stretched over to give one to me. \u201cShe helped me see what I really wanted to do.\u201d</p><p>I looked down. \u201cYou\u2019re in scrapbooking?\u201d The card was cute, eye-catching and a good advertisement for that kind of shop.</p><p>\u201cYes! It was my passion, you see. I did it all the time and had a great network of contacts in that world, online and locally. I knew what people wanted and it\u2019s a multimillion-dollar industry. Can actually bring in billions over time. There were no specialty shops meeting our needs. You have to go into the big box stores and dig for what you want. So frustrating. I started with one shop in a strip center in my hometown and I hit at just the right time.\u201d She giggled. \u201cI have twenty stores now in some of the biggest cities in the southwest. I\u2019m looking to expand east now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s amazing. And Mel, I mean, Ms. Du Monde helped you figure that out?\u201d I noticed that the woman\u2019s outfit was expensive, her hair expertly colored and cut. Her watch was a Rolex and her purse one I would have killed for. Okay, I believed she was doing extremely well.</p><p>\u201cShe made me realize I hadn\u2019t tapped into my potential, or my true passion. It was what I needed to hear at the right time. And there\u2019s the fear, honey. It\u2019s so easy to let that hold you back. I dumped that naysayer I was married to. Boy, did that help me grow and change!\u201d The lights flickered. \u201cOh, we\u2019re going to start.\u201d She laughed. \u201cBrace yourselves. You\u2019re in for a life changing event. Good luck to you!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Rafe picked up my hand which I\u2019d forgotten was clutching his thigh. \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to it.\u201d</p><p>Sure enough, at the exact starting time, the massive doors at the back closed with a loud click and the lights went out completely.</p><p>Then the spotlight came on. There she was, Melisandra Du Monde standing center stage. She wore one of her expensive business suits, this one gray silk, with a microphone clipped to the lapel. She had a strand of pearls around her neck and small pearl studs in her ears. Her dark hair was swept back from her face and done up in a French twist. She looked calmly over the packed house.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to own the world?\u201d She sounded like an evangelist at a prayer meeting. The audience shouted \u201cYes!\u201d and the place erupted into applause. We all joined in. If nothing else, we appreciated the drama.</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re ready to open your minds and your hearts to a new way of thinking. Some of you have been content to live small lives. Is that you? Have you been limiting yourself? Telling yourself this is all you deserve? That to seek more would make you grasping or perhaps even, dare I say it, greedy?\u201d She leaned toward us, resting her elbows on the wooden podium. Her dark eyes raked the room, seeking out the weak. I wanted to shrink down in my seat. Guilty as charged.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Why are you content to be less than you can be? Why do you let others walk on you as if it is their right to be better, greater, have more, be more? How many of you have stood by and watched someone else take what you wanted and done nothing? Raise your hands. Come on. Hold them high. No, I can\u2019t see you. The room is too dark, but your neighbor can. Are you ashamed?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cYou should be. How can you be so spineless?\u201d There was a murmur of outrage in the room.</p><p>I was a charter member of Doormats Anonymous. That had become clear to me lately. I wondered if she could see my hand in the air. I stared right at her. But I was pretty sure she was on a roll, her speech canned, and we were just a faceless crowd.</p><p>\u201cOh, have I hurt your feelings? Too bad. Put your hands down. I don\u2019t want to see cowards here. That\u2019s over. I spit on that.\u201d To our shock she did just that. Elegant, ladylike Melisandra leaned over and spit on the hardwood floor. We all reared back in our seats and gasped.</p> <p>\u201cAh, I\u2019ve shocked you. Good. I\u2019m acting out. Aggressive women are called bitches. Men are hardasses. Ladies don\u2019t spit on polished floors. Neither do gentlemen. Why not? Because society doesn\u2019t like it?\u201d She strode out from behind her podium. \u201cWhat if I tell you I don\u2019t give a damn what society thinks?\u201d She pointed a silver-painted nail around the room. \u201cWho is society? You? You? Or perhaps you are the one who decides what is acceptable.\u201d She stabbed the air in my direction. \u201cI don\u2019t accept your rules. Your restrictions. If I think I\u2019m capable of something, if I want it badly enough, then I will do it, get it, have it. I will find a way. And I sure as hell won\u2019t allow you to take what I want away from me.\u201d</p><p>I had chills. Jerry. She\u2019d wanted him and now she was getting him. He thought he could play her. Could he? She seemed so determined, so in control. Not the wild-eyed voodoo woman I\u2019d seen before at all.</p><p>She began to pace the front edge of the stage. \u201cFind a way. Did I tell you to break laws? No. But you say you can\u2019t get what you want. There are blocks, people, problems in your way. Are there really? Or is it just your fear holding you back?\u201d Her eyes were bright as she stabbed the air. \u201cYou build your own roadblocks, my friends. With your fears, your imagined inadequacies. Oh, poor me. I cannot do it. I am weak. I\u2019m afraid I will fail.\u201d She stopped in the center of the stage. \u201cYes, you will fail. If that is the tape running in your head. Failure breeds failure. Fear breeds failure. Stop it!\u201d Her voice rang out in the silent hall. \u201cGet off the pity train right now!\u201d</p><p>I was pretty sure it wasn\u2019t only the vampires here who had stopped breathing.</p><p>\u201cToday is a fresh start for you. There are no failures here. You have arrived at a new beginning. That pitiful person who let everyone else walk all over them is gone and you will never go back there again. It\u2019s time to decide. What do you want? Have you even dared name it to claim it?\u201d She gestured with her hands. \u201cBring up the lights. Now!\u201d she commanded her unseen minions.</p><p>\u201cNow look under your seats, all of you. You have paper and pens. Pick them up and write down one thing you want. Must have. Think hard. Don\u2019t write down something trivial like a new house or car. Those are things, people. Things you will buy when your success comes to you. I don\u2019t want to see a feeling like success either. That\u2019s too vague. We must define it to see what it means to you, no one else.\u201d She paused, her eyes scanning the crowd, looking for something.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019d better not put a sappy thing like love.\u201d Her laugh haunted me. I\u2019d heard that creepy cackle before. \u201cPlease. That won\u2019t get you what you want. That\u2019s the reward you get once you\u2019ve made it, reached the brass ring and turned it into gold. Love can slow you down, make you weak. Unless it\u2019s your love for the work you do and is part of your passionate drive to the top. I see your faces. Some of you want to argue. Then why are you here? If you want to own the world, focus!\u201d She slammed her fist into her palm.</p><p>I shifted in my seat. Of course I\u2019d gone to love first.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking about a deeply desired something that will make you feel whole again. Change you from the sad sack who never has the best, the promotion, the money to do what your friends or coworkers do. What will make you into the take-charge person who everyone looks up to, the guy or gal who makes a difference, turns the ordinary into the extraordinary.\u201d She paused for breath and we all did the same.</p><p>\u201cAre you thinking? Maybe it\u2019s a business, an idea for an invention you\u2019ve never had the nerve to pursue, a book you want to write, the job you\u2019ve always dreamed about. What do you want? It should be something concrete that you can get if you set goals and realize there are logical steps to achieving them. Come on. You\u2019re here because you needed me. Something was clawing at your gut, aching inside you and it has to come out. You have a hole that must be filled.\u201d She paused, staring around the room one more time, as if searching out the weak so she could shore us up. The woman next to Sienna was practically vibrating with excitement. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to help you find ultimate fulfillment and happiness. Aim you toward your greater good and get you moving in the right direction. You\u2019re going to take control of your life and make it become what you want it to be. Better, greater. With the world at your feet.\u201d She paused and I could see her gathering energy from the crowd that was absolutely mesmerized by her. Hey, even me. I couldn\u2019t look away.</p><p>\u201cSo think, people. Dig deep and find the truth. What do you want? This is the first step. I give you ten minutes. This is your idea. Don\u2019t talk to your neighbor, friend, lover or whoever came with you. This is your deepest desire, not theirs. Go!\u201d She waved her hands then we all dove under our seats for our pads and pens.</p><p>My hand shook as I stared down at the paper with her logo on it. The pen had the same. My deepest desire? I had to think about it. Love? No, not allowed. Money? I always needed it. But that was too abstract. I could get it if I went to Olympus. I needed a way to earn it myself without nasty strings attached. I\u2019d never been afraid to work for what I wanted. Security. My heart thumped. Oh, boy, did that resonate. I could have had it with Jerry centuries ago, but at a price. Okay. Independence and security. Bingo.</p> <p>Work that I enjoyed could get me that. Was it a singing career? Somehow I didn\u2019t think so. I hadn\u2019t really missed singing that much through the centuries. Probably because my subconscious associated it with murder. The idea of being in the spotlight, the focus of the crowd, wasn\u2019t thrilling me either. I\u2019d spent centuries in the shadows, blending. I couldn\u2019t bear the thought of changing that much. True entertainers like Ray and Sienna got off to the attention and they\u2019d had it prefangs. Me? I just couldn\u2019t see it.</p><p>But I did love my little shop. I\u2019d always wanted to make it more successful, to have more capital to spend and to grow the business. Kind of like the scrapbooking lady. I\u2019d seen her excitement at taking a hobby and making it into a moneymaking success. Yes! I wanted a thriving business, the best vintage clothing shop in Austin, hey, maybe in Texas. Successful enough that I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about paying the bills at the end of every month like I did now.</p><p>I was getting excited, sure I was on to something. My mother had shown me high-quality vintage things. I\u2019d never been able to afford to travel and acquire that kind of merchandise. I would love to be able to do that. The hunt was the thrill I was looking for. I was tired of being looked down on by my friends who wore only the very best of everything. I liked vintage. Why not specialize in buying and selling the best of it?</p><p>I got busy writing. I glanced right. Rafe was writing, so was Sienna. Then I looked up. Mel was standing a few feet away. She smiled, a cold smile that sent shivers up my spine. I nodded, then casually rested my hand on Rafe\u2019s thigh, making it clear who I\u2019d come with to her program. He glanced at me and smiled, then covered my hand with his. Mel moved closer. Anyone watching would think she was pausing to help me.</p><p>She bent down to whisper in my ear. \u201cYou aren\u2019t fooling me. Why are you here?\u201d</p> <p>I felt a chill brush past my face. One of her ghouls? I showed her my paper, full of notes. \u201cI saw your Web site, I\u2019m here for help.\u201d I tightened my grip on Rafe\u2019s leg. \u201cWe both are.\u201d</p><p>She smiled tightly. \u201cA wise decision. Focus on a new beginning. Because your old life is behind you.\u201d She flicked her fingers so near my face that I flinched before I could stop myself. Rafe was halfway out of his seat when I pulled myself together enough to hold him back.</p><p>\u201cNo, Rafe, I\u2019m fine.\u201d I kept my eyes on her as she moved on down the aisle. She stopped to speak to a woman who seemed frozen over her pad of paper. Mel was calm and acting totally professional. But then this was her business. I doubted she\u2019d jeopardize it over a personal matter. But I hadn\u2019t imagined the threat or warning in her voice.</p><p>Still, three hours later I knew Mel was on to something. Despite my resistance, I\u2019d learned from her and I felt drained but exhilarated. I wanted a thriving vintage clothing business and it was time to take it seriously. It seemed like everything and everyone else had come first lately. I was easily distracted. Because I\u2019d never really nailed down my goals. Now I had a list. My pad was full of the insights Mel\u2019s program had helped me figure out.</p><p>I\u2019d had offers before to get my inventory on computer and I hadn\u2019t followed through with them. I\u2019d turned down his help when Jerry had wanted to help me with a business plan. Stupid. The man was a genius with stuff like that. I had a great manager in Lacy but I was underutilizing her talents. My list was loaded with things like that. By the time we headed to the car, I was bursting to share. I could tell Sienna and Rafe had also gotten a lot out of the session.</p><p>\u201cI hate to admit it, but the woman has something to sell. She may be weird off the stage, but her seminars are powerful.\u201d Rafe started the car. \u201cI\u2019m seriously jazzed about some things I can do with N-V. What about you, Sienna?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI got a lot out of it.\u201d She clutched her pad. \u201cTell you later. I want to think it through. Glory? What was your big revelation? Is it a singing career?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Sorry to disappoint you, but I\u2019m really focusing on my shop.\u201d I smiled at Rafe. \u201cVintage Vamp\u2019s. I think Halloween will be a one-shot wonder with the singing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding. With your talent?\u201d Sienna kicked the back of the seat. \u201cI had high hopes for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my thing, Sienna. Truly? The singing is a gift I didn\u2019t earn. Making a success of the shop is a real challenge. I started it from practically nothing and it\u2019s lasted longer than some shops on Sixth Street. It feels good to be able to say that. I want to make it bigger and better.\u201d I leaned back and stared out at the night. \u201cAre we headed to N-V? I have rehearsals. Ray wants to use the band with my set and he was going to tell them about it tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess if it\u2019s your one shot, it might as well be a good one.\u201d Sienna sighed. \u201cDamn, I wanted to produce your first record.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing in the public eye is tricky for a vampire. I\u2019d rather not deal with it, Sienna.\u201d I glanced at Rafe. \u201cSo. Big plans for the club?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to get in name bands more often. Maybe try to attract an older crowd. College kids don\u2019t spend much money. I want to expand the cocktail menu, do some specialty food items. I really haven\u2019t explored that side of the business.\u201d He talked on about his plans as he drove down Sixth Street. \u201cOkay, we\u2019re here. Didn\u2019t you tell Miguel you\u2019d meet him here? You ever figure out what you two have going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m definitely off tequila forever. I can\u2019t figure out how, but I\u2019m going to make it clear to him that I have no business with him. Unless it\u2019s to my benefit.\u201d I got out of the car when he stopped. Sienna was right behind me.</p> <p>\u201cWait. What do you mean?\u201d Rafe leaned over the console. \u201cGlory, don\u2019t start something with Miguel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRafe, I know what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019ll see you inside. There\u2019s Danny, waiting for you, Sienna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I called him when we left the auditorium. He made me promise. He\u2019s a great guy.\u201d She waved when Rafe took off to park his car around back in the alley behind the club. \u201cRafe\u2019s still acting as your bodyguard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of. If things work out as we hope, I won\u2019t need one much longer. But hold on a minute. I realize I haven\u2019t done my job as your mentor. When the craziness of Halloween dies down we need to talk. I haven\u2019t taught you all the stuff you should know as a newbie.\u201d I walked into the club beside her.</p><p>\u201cNo kidding.\u201d Sienna frowned at me. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for Danny, I\u2019d have been in trouble several times. I\u2019m holding you to that, Glory. Mesmerizing, maybe some other vamp stuff I should have learned by now is important, and I\u2019m clueless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. We\u2019ll get to it, I promise.\u201d Then I saw Miguel at the bar. \u201cOh, there\u2019s trouble. One thing is for sure. I\u2019m not doing tequila shots again. Not recommended for vamps, Sienna. Trust me on that.\u201d</p><p>Ray came up behind me. \u201cYou drank tequila, Glory? I thought we couldn\u2019t touch alcohol.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to vanish. Unfortunately there were mortals all around who would wonder about that. \u201cWe can. I just found that out. But in limited quantities. I had a blackout after a few tequila shots last night. It\u2019s dangerous, Ray. And, as an alcoholic, I know you\u2019re not going to try it.\u201d</p><p>His smile didn\u2019t reassure me. \u201cAs an alcoholic, all I can say is, I hope not. I\u2019m heading upstairs to give the boys your songs. You coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a little while. I\u2019ve got to meet with someone first.\u201d I rubbed his shoulder. \u201cThat hope is good enough for me. I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnock it off, Glo. I\u2019m doing the best I can. I don\u2019t need your pity.\u201d He shook off my touch and headed up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cTouchy.\u201d Sienna frowned. \u201cToo bad. He\u2019s got few enough friends as it is. I still won\u2019t forgive him for what he did to me. I\u2019ll tell him to practice with me first, then you can take your time with Mr. Tall, Dark and Dangerous over there.\u201d She licked her lips. \u201cHe has a certain appeal. I always did like a bad boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is that. He\u2019s using Aggie now for his dining companion so I guess your arrangement with her is off. I\u2019d stay as far away from that scene as I could get if I were you.\u201d I smiled. \u201cFair warning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAggie. Figures. And I\u2019m fine without her. Except she is supposed to sing with us. I guess she\u2019s upstairs. Might as well get this over with then.\u201d Sienna headed up the stairs herself with one last look over her shoulder at Miguel. He caught her eye and nodded. I walked over to join him.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a young one. Has barely broken in her teeth, I would say.\u201d Miguel met me halfway across the room. \u201cShall we go up to a table? I\u2019ll have them bring you straight synthetic this time. So you can\u2019t claim I got you drunk.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, she\u2019s young. Made only a week ago. I need to do something about training her. All I\u2019ve done so far is taught her to drink synthetic.\u201d I let him lead me up the stairs to a table far away from any occupied ones on the balcony.</p><p>\u201cYou must pay attention, Gloriana. I believe her shifter bodyguard is giving her his blood. Much as your guard once gave some to you. Verdad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I saw Danny follow Sienna closely up the stairs, his hand on her waist. Thinking back, I realized her cheeks had been flushed from recent feeding when we\u2019d picked her up earlier to go to the auditorium, a deeper flush than a mere synthetic would have given her. Danny had been with her, of course. I\u2019d smelled shifter on her but figured it was just because he\u2019d been guarding her during her death sleep.</p> <p>\u201cThey seem very close. As you and Valdez are.\u201d Miguel just wouldn\u2019t let it go.</p><p>\u201cI never used Rafe as my blood slave, Miguel. I rarely drank from him. Only in emergencies or when . . . Never mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, I see.\u201d He winked. \u201cI can read your mind, you know. There is no better time to feed than after making love.\u201d He laughed at what must have been my furious expression.</p><p>\u201cStay out of my mind. I mean it.\u201d I sat down, spreading my skirt over my knees. I\u2019d dressed carefully for my excursion to see Mel. I had on a red and black print wrap dress that was as slenderizing as anything I owned. My black heels made me taller than usual but I still felt small next to big, muscular Miguel. I shrugged off my black jacket that had given me a professional touch and set my clutch on the table.</p><p>\u201cYou are so easy. I didn\u2019t even have to read your thoughts. Your facial expressions give you away, Gloriana. But enough play, we are here to do business.\u201d He nodded to a waitress who brought over our drinks, slipping her a large bill for her trouble. She blushed and backed away.</p> <p>\u201cWhat business? I have no business with you. I don\u2019t need a loan and that\u2019s all the business I know that you conduct in Austin.\u201d I picked up my drink and took a cautious sip. My favorite flavor and nonalcoholic. I took another drink.</p><p>\u201cGloriana, relax. We were talking about a simple exchange of information. You seem to run with what is considered the legitimate crowd of vampires in Austin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLegitimate? You mean the law-abiding citizens? Then, yes, I do. While you are one of the illegitimate.\u201d I smiled. \u201cOops, I didn\u2019t just call you a bastard, did I?\u201d I couldn\u2019t resist. The man had deliberately gotten me drunk and continued to flaunt powers he considered superior to mine.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be wrong.\u201d His smile was tight. \u201cI want to break away from Lucky Carver and her operation. It has a stench that taints everyone who comes in contact with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean the stench of sleazy, ill-gotten gains.\u201d I set down my drink. \u201cShe\u2019s not my favorite person, obviously. When she turned Ray vampire against his will, I became sorry I ever saved her life. She loans money to desperate people at an exorbitant rate of interest. When they can\u2019t pay, she threatens them, sometimes hiring hit men to make a statement about what happens to deadbeats. You know anything about that?\u201d I was glad we were in a public place. I\u2019d met him in a dark alley once and hadn\u2019t doubted he could have killed me if he\u2019d wanted to. But Miguel had let me go. Yes, he could be bad, but even then I\u2019d sensed a better man somewhere inside his hard exterior.</p><p>\u201cOf course. You know I do. But I\u2019m through with her. I want to settle down, become an honest man. I need your help with that.\u201d He signaled the waitress for another round. \u201cYou promised last night to assist me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy should I?\u201d What the hell had we talked about when I\u2019d been in my tequila tailspin? \u201cI can\u2019t imagine promising you anything.\u201d I picked up my drink.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had too many threats to your shop and you want them to stop. The latest one is by that voodoo woman your lover Blade hooked up with.\u201d Miguel put a hand over his heart. \u201cSurely you remember this conversation. You told me everything. How you hate this Mel person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? I\u2019ve handled threats in the past and I\u2019ll handle her too. I\u2019m sorry I unloaded on you. Won\u2019t happen again.\u201d I drained my first glass just as the second one landed on the table. I was never touching tequila again.</p><p>\u201cI was happy to listen. But you confided in me that you are tired of the men in your life running to your rescue. You need someone who\u2019s not emotionally involved with you to provide protection for your place. Right?\u201d He\u2019d barely touched his first glass. Now he drank it down while he waited for me to process this bombshell.</p><p>Why had I told him all this? Yes, I hated that Jerry, Rafe, even Ray were always coming to my defense. It not only made me feel obligated, it pushed me into the role of helpless female. But the worst thing was that it put the men I loved into harm\u2019s way. I looked Miguel over. If there was ever a man who could take whatever crap came at him and survive unscathed, it was this guy. Not only would he survive, but whoever dared mess with him would regret it if they lived long enough. I\u2019d love to see how he handled Mel and her zombie bookends.</p><p>\u201cMy blessing with the good guys in exchange for your protection?\u201d I traced a circle in the moisture on the table. I\u2019d just written down my future goals. If I\u2019d added protect the business, things could not have fallen into place more perfectly. Mel would have said it was the universe providing what I needed. I just had to pay attention. Too bad I knew this guy for a loose cannon of the most dangerous variety. How confident was I that I could handle him?</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the deal.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t look away when I finally met his gaze.</p><p>\u201cWhat if nothing I do can get you the sweet smell of legitimacy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have faith in you, Gloriana. And if you can find out from your mother that I might be descended from the gods . . .\u201d He raised his hands in an almost Italian gesture. \u201cWell, we know that kind of pedigree goes a long way toward buying forgiveness for past sins with the upright citizens of the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaving Aggie around you isn\u2019t going to add any luster to your image.\u201d I had to say it.</p><p>\u201cHer name is now Angel. I\u2019m hoping she will start acting more like her new name. And she\u2019s disposable.\u201d He leaned back like he hadn\u2019t just hauled Aggie to the dump.</p><p>\u201cNice name. Good luck with that. But rethink disposing of her. Your new image demands a kinder solution. Maybe you can find her a new sucker, uh, I mean protector.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll do it?\u201d He leaned forward, elbows on the table. \u201cI want to start immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen prove you know something about voodoo. This woman Melisandra Du Monde wants my boyfriend Jerry for herself. Can you check on her? See what she\u2019s got going? I don\u2019t want her to hurt him or to get a chance to drug him again. She did that once and it almost destroyed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do that.\u201d He reached across the table.</p><p>I stared down at his outstretched hand. \u201cWhat? You want to shake on the deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. You\u2019ve not agreed formally. I insist on it, Gloriana. I know if you give your word, you will keep it. In my business, I\u2019ve learned how to read people and I\u2019ve done my homework. You do have integrity, do you not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately. It hasn\u2019t always been my friend.\u201d I remembered Mel exhorting us to do whatever it took to get what we wanted. I\u2019d never been ruthless. Mel would see it as a weakness. I looked into Miguel\u2019s deep brown, almost black eyes. He wouldn\u2019t hesitate to do what needed doing. Right now, that was an asset I could use.</p><p>\u201cDo you swear you will honor your half of our bargain, Gloriana?\u201d He just kept staring.</p><p>I swallowed then glanced down at his hand again, dark, big and calloused from years of handling weapons. I laid my hand in his and felt a shock of power bind us together.</p><p>\u201cDeal. Don\u2019t make me regret this, Miguel.\u201d I glanced up in time to see a satisfied smile soften his harsh but handsome features.</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t let me down either, Gloriana.\u201d He raised my hand to his lips, then lightly dragged a fang over it. \u201cI don\u2019t take disappointment well.\u201d</p><p>Fifteen</p><p>I headed upstairs slightly light-headed from all the power exchange. I wasn\u2019t sure what I\u2019d done but, with Miguel checking out Mel, at least I\u2019d done something. Ray was waiting for me and the band clapped when I entered the room.</p><p>\u201cOh, wow. Thanks. But you haven\u2019t heard me sing yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Ray says you\u2019re good, that\u2019s enough for us.\u201d The drummer gave me a cymbal crash. \u201cHop up here and let\u2019s see what you\u2019ve got.\u201d The rest of the band echoed the sentiment.</p><p>Aggie aka Angel made a noise as she walked out of the room. Sienna stopped her and spoke to her quietly. They both left, I guess to hash out the right attitude. I couldn\u2019t worry about it now. I had to prove myself to seasoned musicians.</p><p>When Ray and I were ready, the band started the music, an eighties hit. We looked at each other and smiled. It was fun and the beat with the drums became irresistible. When we finished, the band made appreciative sounds with their instruments.</p><p>\u201cStop! You\u2019re embarrassing me. But I had no idea we could sound so good.\u201d I hugged Ray. \u201cThanks for doing this, Ray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. Now we\u2019ll run through the other two songs. You ready?\u201d He sat down at the piano. We\u2019d talked about how it would go, but now he included the band on these numbers too. I knew it would sound better and it did. By the time we were done, going through the songs time and time again, I was exhausted but elated. We\u2019d rehearse a few more times but basically we\u2019d gotten the songs worked out.</p><p>\u201cThanks, guys.\u201d I gave each band member a hug and made sure we were all happy with how it went. I didn\u2019t tell them this was the one and only time I\u2019d sing in public. I had a feeling it would take the edge off the performance. But I owed it to Ray to let him know. I was surprised Sienna hadn\u2019t told him. But then Sienna probably didn\u2019t say a whole lot to Ray anyway. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou were awesome. What\u2019s next?\u201d</p><p>I stretched. \u201cI\u2019m going home. Jerry may be back late tonight. I want to meet him. The shop closes at midnight on Saturdays so I don\u2019t have to worry about stopping by there for a change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou going to give it up? For a music career?\u201d Ray stacked his music on top of the piano.</p> <p>\u201cNo, the opposite. Music isn\u2019t my passion. Sorry if that disappoints you, Ray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? With all that talent you\u2019re going to just walk away from it? After one gig?\u201d He helped me down from the stage. \u201cI don\u2019t get it, Glory. You could have an amazing career.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it? Amazing?\u201d I let go of his hand. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the strain you\u2019re under, balancing a successful career with a vampire\u2019s schedule. And I know how the paparazzi hound you. I really don\u2019t want to be that public. I had a taste of it when we were supposedly engaged and I hated it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, they weren\u2019t too kind to you. You wore a blue dress and they called you a blueberry.\u201d He grinned. \u201cI think blueberries are delicious.\u201d He grabbed at me playfully.</p><p>\u201cThanks for reminding me.\u201d I walked to the door and checked my phone. \u201cOh, a message from Jerry. Sorry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I get it. He\u2019s won.\u201d Ray made a face. \u201cBut this singing thing. I\u2019m not giving up on you, Glory. You should sing. Share the gift. You owe it to the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I owe it to myself to do what I really want and need. Believe it or not, I learned that tonight from a voodoo priestess.\u201d I kissed his cheek. \u201cNow I\u2019ve got to go. Rafe\u2019s waiting for me downstairs. See you Tuesday for practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. See you.\u201d Ray had decided to pout. I left him to it while I listened to Jerry\u2019s voice mail. He\u2019d stopped at home to shower and change clothes. He would see me on the roof of my building.</p><p>By the time I got home, which was still Lily\u2019s apartment, I was pretty tired. I left Rafe watching a sports show on TV while I showered and changed into a gown and robe. Then I headed for the roof. Rafe left me to it. He could certainly hear if anyone entered the building and tried to go past him to the roof.</p><p>I settled on a lawn chair someone had left out to watch the stars and had just dozed off when I sensed movement above me. A familiar black bird drifted down from the sky. Then the man I loved shifted in front of me.</p><p>\u201cJerry!\u201d I jumped up and ran into his arms. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the kind of welcome a man dreams about.\u201d He pulled me close and kissed me. When he finally let me go, he ran his hands down my body. \u201cHmm. What\u2019s this? Ready for bed? Rafe around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call him. You can stay with me. Mel probably thinks you\u2019re still in Miami anyway.\u201d I pulled my phone out of my robe pocket and gave Rafe instructions. \u201cAll clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still in Lily\u2019s apartment?\u201d He followed me downstairs.</p><p>\u201cYes, I love it.\u201d I unlocked the door. When we were both inside, I threw off my robe. \u201cBut not as much as I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t deserve this.\u201d He brushed my hair back from my face. \u201cGloriana, you\u2019re so beautiful. When am I going to hear you sing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget singing.\u201d I pulled his hand to my breast. \u201cMake love to me, Jerry. Show me that you\u2019re mine, all mine. And that Mel doesn\u2019t have any part of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t speak that woman\u2019s name in this place. I won\u2019t have her here.\u201d He pulled me roughly to him, his mouth on mine. He swept me into his arms and carried me into the bedroom, where he laid me gently on the bed. He threw off his clothes until he was naked.</p><p>I gazed up at his strong male body, the muscles, the scars, every inch of him so dear to me. He reached down and slid my nightgown up and off over my head. Then he began a leisurely exploration, kissing a path up one of my legs and down the other. He stroked my breasts and slipped his tongue around each nipple until he sucked one into his warm mouth. I gripped his hair and urged him on, begging him to take me sooner, harder.</p> <p>God, but he was being patient. I wanted to flip him over and force him to finish this. No. Why the rush? I bit my lip and let him continue his erotic torture as he kissed his way down to the pleasure point between my thighs. He pulled my legs up and over his shoulders, grinning at me wickedly before he licked inside, his tongue toying with me and bringing me to a screaming peak that had me twisting his ears.</p><p>\u201cBastard! I\u2019ll make you pay for that.\u201d I shuddered on the bed, beside myself with pleasure.</p><p>\u201cOh, will you?\u201d He leaned back enough for me to see the light in his eyes while he slid his hand down to squeeze my buttocks. Then he ran his fingers inside to tease me mercilessly. \u201cDo you hate this? Or this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I panted. \u201cOh, God, but I hate that even more.\u201d I writhed on the bed as the sensations spiraled out of control again. He knew what he was doing to me and laughed before sliding me down his body to plunge inside. This was what I\u2019d been craving, needing so desperately. Oh, the way he filled me. I grabbed his arms, my nails biting into his flesh. I smelled his blood and my fangs were down, eager to take his vein.</p><p>\u201cTake me, Gloriana. I want you to have all of me.\u201d He fell on top of me, his neck just where I needed it.</p><p>I gasped as I held him close, my lips on his warm, salty skin, my bite clean and true. His blood flooded my mouth and I filled myself with him even as I felt him come inside me, warm and perfect just as I was clenching around him.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Gloriana. No one else. Ever.\u201d He whispered in my ear as he thrust one last time.</p><p>I wrapped my arms and legs tight around him, afraid to let him go. He was mine. Only mine. I told him that in my thoughts then gave him my vein, offering him strength that I knew he needed after his long trip. Finally we slipped apart, holding each other and falling on our pillows moments before dawn.</p><p>I tried not to imagine him in Mel\u2019s bed. He\u2019d have to hold her before he looked into her eyes and convinced her that they\u2019d made passionate love even though they hadn\u2019t. Would it work? Were we crazy to even try to fool a voodoo priestess?</p><p>I lay dry-eyed, his arm heavy around me, and prayed we wouldn\u2019t regret this plan just as dawn began to pull me under. Jerry already snored beside me, exhausted from his shift across country.</p><p>Then I heard the hall door open. Rafe. We\u2019d arranged for him to slip back inside the apartment to keep us both safe during the daylight hours. I inhaled once, just to be sure. Yes, it was him. I relaxed and turned to kiss Jerry\u2019s bare chest, then his sleepy smile. It couldn\u2019t be our last time together. I\u2019d know it, surely. Then the sun rose and I knew nothing at all.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Jerry was about to sneak out after sunset when I took a call from Caitlin and arranged to meet her at the shop. He decided to go down and wait for her with me.</p><p>\u201cYou actually went to one of Mel\u2019s seminars?\u201d Jerry stood beside me while I unlocked the door. \u201cShe can be impressive, can\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, though I hate to admit it. She got me fired up to get serious about the shop. Focus my energy. I guess I can see why you might, might have been attracted to her in the first place.\u201d</p><p>Jerry leaned against the door before I could open it. \u201cI\u2019ll always regret it, Gloriana.\u201d He rubbed my cheek with his thumb. \u201cI hope it\u2019s taught me to control my bloodlust from now on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Jer. It wasn\u2019t just bloodlust at work. She\u2019s a beautiful, intelligent, dynamic\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush.\u201d He pressed that thumb over my lips. \u201cYou\u2019re all the woman I want or need. No more time-outs, Gloriana. Promise me. When we\u2019re apart, I obviously go mad.\u201d</p><p>I reached for his hand. \u201cPoor Jerry. Do you get lonely without me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, yes.\u201d He pulled me to him, kissing me hard, then just as suddenly pulled back. \u201cDo you smell blood?\u201d He reached behind me and threw open the door.</p><p>I froze and grabbed his arm. \u201cYes. It smells like something died in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay here and I\u2019ll check it out.\u201d He had on his warrior face.</p><p>\u201cJer, we go together. This is my place of business.\u201d Dreading what I would find, I flipped on the lights and proceeded with caution, trailing behind him since he wasn\u2019t about to let me go first. Was this Mel\u2019s doing? Who else? I thought we\u2019d resolved our issues. I\u2019d shown up with Rafe, clearly moving on from Jerry. Hadn\u2019t I been convincing enough? What did she want? For us to rip off our clothes and get busy in the aisle during her brief intermission?</p><p>\u201cWell, shit.\u201d He stopped in his tracks. \u201cThere\u2019s a dead goat lying on your counter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn her! You know who has to be behind this, Jer. What do you bet she\u2019s done some kind of voodoo spell work here.\u201d The gutted animal was spread out on top of my fine jewelry case. Thank God the lock wasn\u2019t broken so the gold and silver trinkets weren\u2019t harmed. But there was blood everywhere, ruining any paperwork left lying around and spreading to the edge of a display of silk scarves. I snatched them back, relieved that they weren\u2019t touched.</p><p>\u201cThat crazy bitch.\u201d Jerry strode around the shop. \u201cAnd look at this. Dead chickens. She\u2019s done one of her ceremonies all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d A symbol was drawn in blood on the floor in front of the entrance to my shop. It didn\u2019t take a voodoo dictionary to know that Mel was trying to keep customers from entering.</p><p>\u201cGuess she wants to ruin your business.\u201d Jerry walked over and dropped to his knees to examine a circle of dead chickens. \u201cI\u2019d say Mel\u2019s trying to put some kind of spell on you. How do you feel? Any weird aches or pains?\u201d He was up and by my side in an instant.</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t be ridiculous. Are you telling me you believe in that stuff? I\u2019m, uh, fine.\u201d But my throat tightened and I panicked. Could I talk, sing? I swallowed and cleared my throat. Of course I was all right. Mind games. The blood, the dead animals. It was all designed to freak me out. Too bad it was working. I shivered and grabbed a shawl from a display to wrap around me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBelieve in it? Just the evidence that I\u2019ve seen with my own eyes that she\u2019s got some kind of power. In Miami, I saw her stare at people until they sickened. And you and I have seen her ghosts and her zombie-like creatures. Hell, I don\u2019t know what I believe anymore.\u201d He kept his arm around me. \u201cYou look pale, Gloriana. Sit down and I\u2019ll clean up this mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, seriously, I\u2019m just disgusted, horrified and trying to figure out what that bitch will do next. You know Mel\u2019s determined to have you and now we\u2019ve decided to let her think she\u2019s got you.\u201d I held on to him and couldn\u2019t seem to let go. \u201cGod, Jerry. I don\u2019t think I can stand the thought of you that close to a crazy woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s never going to have me, Gloriana.\u201d He brushed the hair back from my face. \u201cI can kill her tonight and make sure no one ever finds her body.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo! I won\u2019t have that on your conscience. You\u2019re not a stone cold killer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo protect the woman I love\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said no, Jer. So far she\u2019s done nothing but a little vandalism. I\u2019m not even going to call the police about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you should. If she left fingerprints . . .\u201d He let me go and walked over to the dead chickens. \u201cLook here. She obviously wrung their necks then sliced them open and drained their blood into a goblet. She shattered the goblet when she was done. See? There\u2019s a piece of the pedestal and the rest rolled under the dress rack. Bet the cops could get a fingerprint off the glass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it. The police already think this shop is strange with the vamp mural and some of the reports we\u2019ve put in. Remember when we were firebombed? All reporting this would do is make Mel mad at me. Do we really want that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. But she picked your lock.\u201d He\u2019d walked over to the back door. \u201cWhat happened to your security system? Cameras?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t afford to keep them, Jerry. We\u2019re rarely closed anyway. Sunday and Monday are the only times someone\u2019s not here twenty-four hours a day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFalse economy, Gloriana, but too late to think about that now.\u201d He grabbed a garbage bag and began picking up chickens and dumping them in the bag like it was no big deal. I didn\u2019t want to touch one. \u201cI tell you this. If you won\u2019t let me kill her, I\u2019m making damn sure she doesn\u2019t spend a moment out of my sight until that potion is ready. Any word on that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s been a setback.\u201d I told him about Ian\u2019s breakin. \u201cBut Cait should be able to tell us more when she gets here.\u201d I grabbed a bucket and mop. I had to get rid of every sign of Mel\u2019s intrusion. What kind of spell had she cast? I looked over the setup she\u2019d used. I\u2019d get on my computer and see if I could find out anything with Google.</p><p>\u201cWhat about during the day?\u201d I stopped next to Jerry. He\u2019d just knocked the goat into another garbage bag.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep Rafe watching you and I\u2019ll hire a shifter to follow Mel. It\u2019s the best I can do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut what about you, Jerry?\u201d I clutched his arm. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in your death sleep, she could do anything to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d He stared at the smear of blood on my counter. \u201cDo you trust me, Gloriana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buts. Trust me to do whatever I must to keep you safe. Mel won\u2019t hurt me as long as she thinks I\u2019m in love with her. I\u2019ll mesmerize her if I can to convince her of that.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed, the determination in the set of his jaw scaring me. \u201cAnd if you can\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do whatever it takes.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Two hours later I was on my way to N-V. I\u2019d found Caitlin a costume after she and Jerry had gotten together about that potion. Ian hadn\u2019t shared his progress with her, but she knew he was working on it. Since he wasn\u2019t answering my calls, that would have to satisfy us. I didn\u2019t dare call Rafe and tell him that Mel apparently still considered me a threat to her happiness. Otherwise Rafe would never have let me take the ten-minute walk to his club alone. He was at the door when I got there though.</p> <p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d He kept me from going inside. \u201cYou look upset.\u201d</p><p>I unloaded on him. Jerry had made me promise to tell Rafe about Mel\u2019s mess in the shop. \u201cSo Mel must have been asking her gods or whatever about her future. I guess she\u2019s still not sure if it\u2019s with Jerry. Or if I\u2019m going to get him. That\u2019s what we got when we checked the Internet. She examined goat\u2019s entrails. Drank chicken blood too. My shop got her action so she could hurt me, I\u2019m sure. She\u2019s still jealous. Can you believe it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch. I thought we\u2019d solved at least one problem.\u201d Rafe peered down the street. \u201cNow we\u2019ve got a new one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you seen Sienna tonight?\u201d He finally moved aside to let me into the club.</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t think to stop by my apartment. I assumed she would have rehearsed first tonight and had already left. Why?\u201d I stepped inside. Miguel was at what I was starting to think of as his usual bar stool and he nodded in my direction.</p><p>\u201cRay\u2019s been trying to reach her. She\u2019s not answering her cell and hasn\u2019t shown up for rehearsal. Then there\u2019s this.\u201d He handed me a paper. It was a tabloid, one of the same ones that had labeled me a chubby blueberry. I hated those gossipy rags.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I didn\u2019t want to touch it.</p><p>\u201cRead the headline, Glory.\u201d Rafe held it up so I couldn\u2019t avoid seeing it.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Rock star claims she\u2019s a vampire. Drug meltdown on the air.\u2019 What the hell?\u201d I knew my mouth was hanging open. I closed it with a snap. \u201cSummarize the article.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll love it. The only thing missing is a picture of Sienna with her fangs down.\u201d Rafe pulled me toward his office. \u201cThat\u2019s because this all came out when your girl did a radio interview the other night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told me she had one scheduled but not that she planned to say anything like this.\u201d I snatched the paper and read through the article. Yes, it was all there. Sienna\u2019s claim that she\u2019d become a vampire. She\u2019d bragged about how strong she was and that she would live forever young. Bonus claim? She drank blood now, no more dieting. I moaned. My only hope was that everyone would think she was as crazy as a bedbug with fangs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t warn you or you\u2019d have gagged her and sat on her to keep her from doing it. It was a nationally syndicated show. Goes to hundreds of stations. There\u2019s an audiotape on YouTube. I listened to the whole interview. You won\u2019t believe how many downloads it\u2019s had already. When Sienna comes clean, she doesn\u2019t miss a trick. Apparently she even showed her fangs to the deejay. Volunteered to take him down a pint if he was interested too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. My. God.\u201d I collapsed in a chair inside his office. Nate was there, his ear to his phone. When he saw us, I heard him say something about rehab before he ended his call.</p><p>\u201cYou told her.\u201d Nate\u2019s phone buzzed. He glanced at it then turned it off. \u201cSienna\u2019s manager and agent are forwarding all inquiries to me. And, trust me, there are plenty. You heard what I just said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou going along with blaming it on drugs? Sending her to rehab? Or pretending to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else can I say, Glory? That she\u2019s telling the truth?\u201d Nate rubbed his eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine the fallout if this goes any further. I\u2019m sticking with the drug story. Hoping this blows over fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to hate that. You know how proud she is of her sobriety.\u201d My own phone vibrated in my jeans pocket. I looked at the caller ID. \u201cHere she is. Let\u2019s see what she has to say for herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSienna, where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m at Danny\u2019s place. Um, did you hear what I told the deejay last night? Isn\u2019t that amazing?\u201d She sounded tentative, despite her brave words. I hoped that meant she was getting a clue.</p><p>\u201cYes, I heard about it. Saw the tabloids.\u201d I\u2019d managed to stay calm so far. Then I lost it. \u201cAre you freaking nuts? We do not tell the world we exist, much less offer to drink from a mortal on national radio.\u201d I was yelling. Okay, maybe I should stop and take a breath. Rafe and Nate just sat back and watched.</p><p>\u201cI listened to Mel last night, Glory, just like you did. I thought about what was holding me back from being the best I could be. It\u2019s all this secrecy. I can\u2019t stand to sneak around. It was keeping me from reaching my potential. I have power now. Why can\u2019t I use it to show the world what I am? Fans will love it. I\u2019ll be breaking new ground. Can you imagine? The first vampire rock star!\u201d She sounded excited now.</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not going to happen. And Ray has that honor, if you want to call it that. Not you.\u201d I said it as firmly as I could. \u201cListen to me. Going public isn\u2019t in your best interests. There are powerful vampires out there who will make sure that no one believes you. They will take you out before they let you spread the word like you tried to do last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake me out? What the hell does that mean? Don\u2019t be ridiculous. What I did was great. People are fascinated by us. Look at the books and movies out there. Vampires are cool. And mortals don\u2019t know what we can really do. All they know is just fantasy.\u201d Sienna wasn\u2019t paying attention. \u201cI\u2019ve come out of the closet and I\u2019m staying out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to me, Sienna. I\u2019m not kidding. People aren\u2019t fascinated by vampires, they\u2019re scared of them. When they see the reality of what we are, they want to kill us. Face a vampire hunter with a stake in his hand and then tell me coming out is cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re wrong. Once they see how normal we are\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNormal! Are you freaking kidding me? You drink blood. Have fangs. Are dead all day. Are you saying that\u2019s normal?\u201d I was yelling again. I tried to calm down. Counted to three. \u201cPlease. We have a small window of opportunity to fix this. We can put out that you were high. That you were tripping and made up this vampire nonsense. We\u2019ll send you to rehab. Not really but you\u2019ll have to lie low for a while. Until the talk dies down and some other star jumps the shark.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo!

Ray can tell you that they stick by you when you relapse.\u201d I heard her curse Ray. Nothing new there.</p><p>\u201cLook. This will give me time to work with you, teach you what you need to know to be a successful vampire. I can introduce you to some experienced vamps who can help you deal with the daily grind of keeping a low profile. Some people who will be better mentors than I\u2019ve been.\u201d I glanced at Rafe. \u201cI know I\u2019ve let you down or you never would have done something so stupid.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStupid? I don\u2019t appreciate that, Glory.\u201d</p><p>I stared at my phone. \u201cShit. She just hung up on me.\u201d I slid the phone back into my pocket. \u201cShe\u2019s at Danny\u2019s. I think we\u2019d better go over there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill it do any good?\u201d Rafe jumped to his feet.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better try something. Her career is circling the drain right now. Reps from her label have called me twice, wondering if she\u2019s stable enough to make the next record. They have grounds for canceling her contract.\u201d Nate pulled out his phone again. \u201cIf I can assure them she\u2019s on her way to rehab, we might have a shot at fixing this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll tell her that.\u201d I turned to Rafe. \u201cDid you know she\u2019s using Danny as her blood donor?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s not good. I thought he knew better.\u201d Rafe jerked open the office door. \u201cIt can make him too weak to do his job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey may be sleeping together too. I got a bit of a vibe about that before.\u201d I followed him out of the office.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t be the first time a guard and his employer got involved. Remember?\u201d Rafe stalked across the dance floor. It was crowded and he had to weave around the dancers.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen if Sienna has to disappear right away?\u201d I stopped him next to the bar.</p><p>\u201cYou lose one of your lead singers? I have a suggestion.\u201d Miguel was right there, his smile predatory. \u201cI saw the tabloids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now, Cisneros.\u201d Rafe clearly wasn\u2019t in the mood.</p> <p>\u201cJust keep in mind, amigo, that you have a big night coming. Israel Caine singing alone? Okay. Maybe. But with a new singer? Even better. Gloriana has her little set, yes. But what if Angel were to step in for Sienna? She knows the songs and her voice is certainly up to the task.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngel?\u201d Rafe looked clueless.</p><p>\u201cAggie.\u201d I had to give Miguel credit. He knew how to take advantage of a situation.</p><p>\u201cTalk to Caine about that. I\u2019m going with Glory now to see what we can do about Sienna.\u201d Rafe took my elbow and marched me to the door. \u201cWait here. I\u2019m pulling the car around.\u201d He strode off.</p><p>\u201cToo bad about the rock star. Can\u2019t keep her mouth shut.\u201d Miguel stayed close while I waited by the door.</p><p>\u201cYes, well, I\u2019m going to set her straight on that.\u201d I didn\u2019t like the way Miguel was almost enjoying this crisis.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better. I\u2019ve already had three calls, requesting hits on her. There is no wish among powerful vampires for our world to be exposed.\u201d He leaned against the brick wall, looking totally at ease discussing murder. \u201cI told the clients I\u2019d have to get back to them.\u201d His smile gave me chills. \u201cIt would be smart to wait anyway. There may be more. So far the contracts were from people who don\u2019t speak to each other. I could accept them all and get paid for each one. I like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t.\u201d I hated how calm he was about this.</p> <p>\u201cWhy not? It\u2019s a simple business deal. And this woman is endangering all of us. I might even be tempted to do it for free, except I won\u2019t have to.\u201d His smile widened. \u201cI think this vampire council the A-list here in Austin thinks so highly of would be quite happy if Ms. Star were to simply disappear one night. Don\u2019t you? I\u2019m sure they hate troublemakers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be happy. Leave her alone, Miguel.\u201d I poked him in his powerful chest. \u201cShe\u2019s my responsibility. Let me handle her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems to me you failed. She\u2019s out of control.\u201d He grabbed my hand, squeezing just enough to make me bite my lip. \u201cShut her up, Glory, or I will. And I\u2019ll make it look like an overdose. Entiendes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I get you. Let me go or Rafe will jump out of that SUV that just pulled up and go shifter all over you.\u201d I jerked my hand away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see him try. I really would.\u201d Miguel stepped back inside the club.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that about?\u201d Rafe asked as I slid into his car.</p><p>\u201cNothing. Let\u2019s go. I assume you know where Danny lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, got it off his employee records. I accessed it and Google Maps from my phone.\u201d He gunned his motor. \u201cI don\u2019t like seeing you with Cisneros.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad. He\u2019s useful. I\u2019m using him.\u201d I looked out at the passing houses. \u201cIs it far?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot too. What\u2019s with the attitude?\u201d Rafe glanced at me.</p><p>\u201cNo attitude, I\u2019m just taking Mel\u2019s advice. Focusing on my goals. Miguel\u2019s a scary dude. Sometimes it\u2019s handy to have one on call, that\u2019s all. You have your own business to run, Rafe. You don\u2019t have to always be available to take care of mine.\u201d I realized we were stopping already. \u201cHe lives here?\u201d It was a nice home, almost an estate with the size of the grounds around it.</p><p>\u201cIn an apartment over the garage out back. We\u2019ll leave the car on the street. I\u2019m afraid if we let them hear us coming they might take off. Danny\u2019s no fool, though he certainly acted like one when he let Sienna shoot off her mouth on the radio. By now he\u2019ll have realized we\u2019ll try to shut Sienna down.\u201d Rafe pocketed his keys and helped me out of the car.</p><p>\u201cYou think he knew what she was going to say during the interview?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope not. Surely he would have told you or me what was coming or stopped her himself. Shifters also fly under the radar you know. This isn\u2019t cool for any of us.\u201d Rafe led the way toward a stone three-car garage with a second-story apartment above it. \u201cLooked like there\u2019s an entrance on the right.\u201d</p><p>We slipped quietly up the stairs then listened. There was a TV going and the murmur of voices. Finally, I just knocked. Someone immediately cut off the television and there was complete silence.</p><p>Sixteen</p><p>\u201cCome on, Sienna, Danny. We know you\u2019re in there. Answer the door.\u201d I knew I sounded insistent. \u201cPlease? We just want to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s with you?\u201d Sienna\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cJust Rafe. Can we come in?\u201d I jiggled the doorknob. Locked of course. \u201cYou know either of us could break the door down. Don\u2019t make it come to that. I\u2019m sure Danny has a security deposit he doesn\u2019t want to lose.\u201d</p><p>Finally we heard the door unlock. Sienna opened it, Danny\u2019s arm around her. \u201cWhat do you want? I said all I\u2019m going to on the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we sit down and you listen to me for a few minutes?\u201d I didn\u2019t wait for permission, just stepped inside. Rafe stood in front of the door. I guess he wanted to make sure they didn\u2019t make a break for it. Smart.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to call me stupid again, save it.\u201d Sienna glared at me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I was upset. But I don\u2019t think you realize what danger you\u2019re in.\u201d I walked over and sat on the couch. \u201cSit and let me explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stand. I told you, I\u2019m not pretending I\u2019m back on drugs. I worked too hard to get clean.\u201d She crossed her arms over her chest and leaned back against Danny. Clearly their relationship was more intimate than just a bodyguard and his client. Fast work.</p><p>\u201cHow else are you going to explain that what you said to the deejay wasn\u2019t true?\u201d I leaned forward, totally serious. \u201cBecause you have to retract your statements, Sin. Your life depends on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re exaggerating. No one would try to kill me over this.\u201d She looked away, unwilling to meet my eyes.</p><p>\u201cYes, they would. I talked to a hit man tonight. He\u2019s already received calls. Requests to take you out. You\u2019ll be dead in days unless you make sure no one believes your tales of fangs and blood drinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know a hit man?\u201d Sienna looked bewildered as she finally sat beside me.</p><p>\u201cIs that all you got out of that? I\u2019m serious, Sienna. Your record label is ready to dump you. Ranting about vampires to the media on a national broadcast made you a liability.\u201d I grabbed her arm. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to tell you something and trust you will not repeat it. There\u2019s an executive with your label who\u2019s a vamp. He could very well be one of the clients that hit man heard from. When people start looking for vampires? They find them. He\u2019s an important man who can\u2019t afford close scrutiny. Threaten his business and you\u2019re expendable, Sienna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Someone from my label? Who?\u201d Sienna couldn\u2019t have looked more startled.</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019d trust you with that information?\u201d I laughed. I guess it was a good thing Sienna and Ray weren\u2019t on speaking terms or she\u2019d already know who it was. \u201cHoney, you\u2019ve gone way past getting me to share any more confidences with you. Now assure me that you\u2019re ready to check yourself into the vampire version of rehab. Nate can handle a public statement for you. It\u2019s the only way to keep that career you\u2019re so proud of. And your life.\u201d</p><p>To my complete astonishment, she didn\u2019t even take time to think about it. Instead she got a mulish look on her face that I\u2019d never seen before. Didn\u2019t she believe me?</p><p>\u201cNo. Figure out something else. I simply can\u2019t say I\u2019m doing drugs again.\u201d She reached out and Danny moved close to take her hand. \u201cAnd there\u2019s the concert on Halloween. I won\u2019t miss it. I honor my commitments.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, yeah? I guess your commitment to keep vampires a secret doesn\u2019t count. Since you never wanted to go there in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got that right.\u201d She held my gaze, obviously deadly serious.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll just let your singing career go down in flames?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe it will. It\u2019s a bluff by the label. There\u2019s no such thing as bad publicity. Wait and see. I\u2019ll attract new fans. Pick up some Goth bodyguards to go along with the new image. I\u2019ve got it all worked out.\u201d She smiled up at Danny before aiming a defiant look at me. \u201cScrew your fake rehab.\u201d</p><p>I fumed for a minute. Clueless newbie. But the set of her jaw convinced me she wasn\u2019t budging. Finally I thought of something.</p><p>\u201cTrust me that this isn\u2019t the right time for your, um, coming out. Maybe later.\u201d Like never. \u201cWhen you\u2019re more used to our ways, you can consider alternatives, not be so impulsive.\u201d I at least had her attention.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I would have liked to have been on national television. At least TMZ. Showing off the fangs loses its punch on radio.\u201d Sienna laughed.</p><p>Oh, boy, did I want to smack some sense into her. Instead I plowed ahead with my diversion tactic.</p> <p>\u201cThere you go. Now, the Halloween gig gives me an idea of how we can at least put this one fire out. To delay things.\u201d I caught Rafe\u2019s eye. He obviously wanted a private word with Danny. \u201cI need to teach you something first. Danny, I believe Rafe needs to speak to you outside.\u201d I sent Rafe a mental message to be sure to let Danny know that he\u2019d dropped the ball with Sienna. She wasn\u2019t out of the woods by any means, especially if what I had in mind didn\u2019t work.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to teach me?\u201d Sienna stood and paced the floor. By the time I\u2019d outlined my plan, she was excited. \u201cThis is perfect! Even my publicist will love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see. Now, you sure you can do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so. Call in the guys and let me practice.\u201d She grinned.</p><p>\u201cShifters aren\u2019t as easy as mortals, Sienna. But you can try.\u201d</p><p>When Danny and Rafe came back inside, both of them were pretty grim. There\u2019d obviously been a scuffle. Danny had a scrape under one eye.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re all set. You figure out what to do?\u201d Rafe still wasn\u2019t smiling and kept flexing his right hand.</p><p>\u201cI hope so. Danny, would you look at Sienna?\u201d I was anxious to see if my fledgling could carry this off.</p><p>\u201cSure. Honey, I need to apologize. I let you down. Rafe explained the danger I\u2019ve put you\u2014\u201d He stopped. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing? Trying to mesmerize me?\u201d He pulled her to him. \u201cSweetheart, that\u2019s never going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it. Then this plan won\u2019t work.\u201d She turned to me. \u201cGlory, you\u2019re going to have to come along. I keep getting distracted. I was thinking about how serious Danny looked instead of the whole whammy thing. I know once we get there I\u2019ll be nervous too. I won\u2019t be able to concentrate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was afraid of that, and we don\u2019t have time to find anyone else for you to practice on.\u201d I glanced at my watch. \u201cCall the deejay and find out if he can see you tonight. We have to do this now. On top of everything else, you know Ray is probably throwing fits, don\u2019t you? Because you didn\u2019t show up for rehearsal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet him.\u201d She brushed Danny\u2019s cheek with a fingertip. \u201cBaby, are you all right? Rafe didn\u2019t hurt you, did he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can take care of myself, Sin. Rafe pointed out that I should have done a better job of watching you. Letting you shoot off your mouth last night wasn\u2019t smart. It\u2019s on me. From now on, you\u2019ve got to let me take the lead and you should talk over your plans with me first. I do have years of experience in this world.\u201d He pulled her to him.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve found out. Lots of experience in everything.\u201d She sighed then ran her fingertip down his chest. \u201cI\u2019m sorry too. I got you in trouble, didn\u2019t I? But I\u2019m still not convinced outing vampires isn\u2019t a good idea.\u201d She stared at me. \u201cI mean it, Glory. You may have talked me down this time, but I\u2019m coming out someday. Wait and see.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSienna . . .\u201d I was beginning to think I should mesmerize her and see if I could change her whole attitude. Would it work? Probably not. To paraphrase what Jerry had said, you could make someone forget breaking a particular rule, but not that they loved breaking rules in general. Damn it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about this anymore. Ray\u2019s called so many times that I turned off my phone.\u201d She pulled it out of her purse. \u201cOh. I\u2019ve got three missed calls from a Damian Sabatini. Who\u2019s that, Glory? Do you know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet I do. He\u2019s the head of the vampire council. Call him back. You\u2019ll see that I\u2019m not exaggerating your problems if you persist in trying to make the vampire thing public.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take your word for it.\u201d She stared down at her phone.</p><p>\u201cNo, you can\u2019t ignore him. Hand me that phone.\u201d I hit the button to call Damian back. \u201cDamian? It\u2019s Glory. I\u2019m mentoring Sienna Star.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re doing a piss-poor job, I must say. What the hell is going on, Gloriana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you read the tabloids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. But I\u2019ve received plenty of irate calls and been directed to a YouTube audiotape. Your fledgling is out of control. What are you doing about it, signorina? Eh?\u201d His Italian accent was coming out, a sure sign of agitation.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s under control. She\u2019s recanting. But maybe you should hear her say that.\u201d I passed the phone back to Sienna.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d She listened to what had to be a long speech about the importance of vampire secrecy. \u201cYes, sir. I\u2019m going back on the radio tonight.\u201d Another long pause. \u201cYes. I\u2019ll call Marvin now. He\u2019s the deejay. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be all over this. It\u2019s a scoop he can\u2019t resist.\u201d Tears in her eyes. \u201cNo, sir. I don\u2019t want that.\u201d Her eyes widened. \u201cNo! I don\u2019t!\u201d She hit the end button with a shaky fingertip. \u201cWow!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d I knew Damian had a temper but he must have pulled out some big threats to make her go pale and turn her face into Danny\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cNever mind. I\u2019m going to call. Give me a minute.\u201d She took a breath then began scrolling through her contact list.</p><p>Rafe pulled me outside. \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait and see. You\u2019re not going to want to miss this if we can pull it off.\u201d</p><p>Sienna and Danny met us on the porch. \u201cLet\u2019s go. Marvin\u2019s eager to talk. This whole kerfuffle has given him great ratings. I think it\u2019s going to work, Glory. It has to work.\u201d Sienna ran down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cThe radio station is on I-35, Rafe. You want to drive?\u201d Danny ran after Sienna.</p><p>\u201cGuess I\u2019d better.\u201d Rafe shrugged as we followed them. \u201cI hope you know what you\u2019re doing, Glo. Putting that loose cannon on the radio again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so too.\u201d By the time we arrived at the station, Sienna and I had worked out her spiel. We were met at the door by the night manager and ushered into the booth during a commercial break.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t expect to see you again so soon, Sienna.\u201d The deejay was a middle-aged man who\u2019d obviously been in the business quite a while. \u201cHere to add to that rant last night? Let me see those fangs again.\u201d</p><p>I leaned forward and looked into his eyes. \u201cYou never saw any fangs, Marvin. Sienna doesn\u2019t do drugs anymore. You and Sienna were playing a little trick on your listeners, but especially on the tabloids. It was to promote her Halloween gig. Do you understand?\u201d He nodded, definitely mesmerized.</p><p>Sienna\u2019s mouth was open. \u201cYou make it look so easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get the hang of it.\u201d I noticed Rafe and Danny had just brought the technician back to the control room since the commercial break was about over. The men had been our necessary distraction during this part of the process. \u201cOkay, Marvin, looks like you\u2019re on with Sienna Star.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelcome back to Marvin at Midnight, America. Have I got a surprise for you. Guess who\u2019s with me here in the booth again? It\u2019s the lovely Sienna Star. Yes, you heard me. She\u2019s here and she\u2019s just as sober as she was last night. Yes, I said it. Stone-cold sober.\u201d Marvin laughed. \u201cShall we let them in on the joke, Sienna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Marvin. Did you see the headlines today? I don\u2019t know about you, but those tabloids make me crazy. How many alien babies have I had this month?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. And there was that time you and Israel Caine supposedly got married in Tahiti.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. I\u2019ve never been to Tahiti and I sure haven\u2019t married Ray. Though we make some great music together.\u201d Sienna chuckled. \u201cHow about that vampire joke? They jumped on that fast enough. Like I\u2019d have fangs. And ruin these pearly whites?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding. I can\u2019t believe the tabloids fell for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHook, line and blood bag. You and I know it was all to promote the fantastic gig Israel Caine and I have coming up here in Austin on Halloween night at Club N-V. Two shows, one at midnight. And for a special treat, my pal here, Gloriana St. Clair, will be making her singing debut.\u201d She grabbed my arm and pulled me toward a microphone. \u201cSay hi to the folks, Glory.\u201d</p><p>I stammered out something, suddenly tongue-tied.</p><p>\u201cA new rocker, Sienna?\u201d Marvin looked me over with interest. \u201cI have to tell the crowd out there that she\u2019s a blond bombshell. A real looker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making her blush, Marvin.\u201d Sienna laughed. \u201cGlory has a retro style fans will love. Think Michael Bubl\u00e9 only in a miniskirt. Totally hot.\u201d She went on to talk about her upcoming album. I relaxed back in my chair, glad to be done.</p><p>Rafe winked at me through the glass and I figured Sienna had redeemed herself. Now I had to get us all back to the club and settle things with Ray. I bet he was unhappy that we\u2019d never called him back. A glance at my phone let me know he\u2019d tried to get me a half dozen times. I was late for our rehearsal too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Back at the club, I hurried up to the practice room. I could hear Ray and Aggie singing when I got to the door. So he\u2019d really agreed to give her a chance to take Sienna\u2019s place. Had Miguel used some kind of persuasion technique on him? Ray was still a relatively new vamp. I bet Miguel could mesmerize him and Ray wouldn\u2019t even know it.</p><p>\u201cAh, Gloriana. What do you think?\u201d Miguel stood by the doorway, listening. \u201cPretty good for an early run-through. Of course Caine is being hard on her. He\u2019s disappointed that Ms. Star let him down.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not letting anyone down. We got it all fixed. Didn\u2019t you hear? The vamp thing was a publicity stunt. It\u2019ll be all over the regular newspapers tomorrow. I doubt the tabloids will print it.\u201d Sienna strolled in. She calmly stood in front of the stage until Aggie noticed her. To her credit, the former Siren finished the song then jumped off the stage.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be on your way to rehab?\u201d Aggie put her hands on her hips. \u201cAs you can see, I managed to fill your shoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry to disappoint you, but I\u2019m not on drugs and won\u2019t ever go there again. Also, my shoes aren\u2019t the issue here, chickie, so get out of my way.\u201d Sienna brushed past her and took Ray\u2019s hand to climb onto the stage. \u201cSorry, I\u2019m late. I guess you heard I had a kind of meltdown last night. It\u2019s all good now. Glory helped me see the light.\u201d</p><p>Ray stared at me. \u201cYeah, she\u2019s pretty good at that. You okay?\u201d He glanced back at the band. \u201cSienna looks good, doesn\u2019t she, guys?\u201d Their answer was a raucous cacophony of sound and cheers.</p><p>Aggie flounced over to Miguel\u2019s side. \u201cI quit. If they can\u2019t appreciate me, they can do without a backup singer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, you will not quit. There is publicity. Right, Glory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, national publicity after tonight. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if someone from Sienna\u2019s label shows up just to make sure she isn\u2019t using. A good backup singer won\u2019t go unnoticed.\u201d I felt kind of sorry for Aggie. She looked pale and had lost weight. The weight thing was a positive, still leaving her far from skinny. However, if it was because Miguel was taking too much of her blood each night, then I had to hate that.</p><p>\u201cBut they keep disrespecting me.\u201d Aggie was in a full pout now.</p><p>\u201cEarn their respect. Be a professional. Now get back on the stage and do what you\u2019re paid to do.\u201d Miguel swatted her bottom. \u201cDo you hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her lower lip quivered but she did what he said.</p><p>\u201cWow. You\u2019ve got her trained.\u201d Bully. Aggie wasn\u2019t a friend, but no one deserved to be brought so low.</p> <p>\u201cShe responds to a firm hand.\u201d Miguel shook his head. \u201cThe rock star managed to clean up her mess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I can assure you, the contracts for the hits will be withdrawn. Wait and see.\u201d I smiled at his look of disappointment.</p><p>\u201cLucky for her.\u201d He glanced at the stage. \u201cBecause I got two more calls since we talked. I hate to miss such lucrative opportunities. I will leave the clients hanging until we\u2019re sure the matter is properly taken care of.\u201d He smiled and glanced at his phone like he was waiting for a text.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you can afford the financial loss.\u201d I couldn\u2019t help noticing that his clothing was of the finest quality. His silk shirt, fine woolen trousers and leather shoes were custom Italian. He was all in black, a habit with him apparently. He seemed to like to disappear into dark corners and alleys.</p><p>\u201cGlory! Here you are. Rafael sent us up.\u201d Flo tugged on my arm. \u201cCome out here and talk to us. Richard had a friend call him. He heard on the radio that you\u2019re singing here on Halloween. I couldn\u2019t believe it. First, because he has a friend who actually listens to the radio, and second, that you would do such a thing and not tell me.\u201d</p><p>I began to explain the strange happenings that had led to my performing on the N-V stage. I found myself pouring out the entire Mel situation too. Even Jerry\u2019s plan to make her dump him.</p><p>\u201cNo! I can\u2019t imagine Jeremiah loving anyone but you. I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be able to fake it and make her believe him.\u201d Flo hugged me. \u201cAnd how will you stand seeing him pretend to adore the woman you hate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just have to suck it up. If they do come here on Halloween.\u201d It would be a great way to prove to Mel that she could have Jerry. But could I calmly sing my songs while Mel watched and gloated?</p> <p>\u201cHave you seen him? Talked to him lately?\u201d Flo\u2019s look of sympathy just about broke the layer of calm I kept covering the worry that was eating a hole in my heart.</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s committed to staying with her every waking moment until she tosses him aside.\u201d I flashed back to that gutted goat. A woman who had such disregard for life . . . I had no idea what more she was capable of. No idea at all. And Jerry was with her. At her mercy.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Halloween night already. I\u2019d agreed to let my staff close the shop at eleven so they could come to the show. Had even arranged tickets for them. Hey, if I was going to humiliate myself, might as well have a full house with plenty of friendly faces.</p><p>\u201cGlory, I guess I\u2019d better tell you about the table I booked last week in the center of the balcony.\u201d Rafe had come backstage to make sure I had everything I needed. We\u2019d laughed when I\u2019d asked for a one-way ticket to anywhere else.</p><p>\u201cThe vampires? I know about Flo, Richard, Cait and Bart. Oh, and they\u2019re dragging along Ian.\u201d I added some more dramatic eye makeup. Sienna had warned me that the spotlight would wash me out otherwise.</p><p>\u201cDamian too. He\u2019s bringing Diana. But that\u2019s not the one I mean.\u201d Rafe pulled up a stool. \u201cYour mother booked a table, a big one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy am I not surprised? But I wonder who she\u2019ll bring? Not Zeus. She\u2019s still trying to figure out how to break the news that she has a daughter. I can\u2019t imagine that he comes down to Earth on a regular basis anyway.\u201d I gave up on more eyeliner. My hand was shaking too badly.</p><p>\u201cI hope to hell not Zeus. If he gets pissed off, I imagine everything around him takes a hard hit.\u201d Rafe picked up a blush brush and grabbed my chin. \u201cI\u2019ve worked too hard to make this club a success. I won\u2019t see it go down now. Hold still. You look even paler than usual. Nerves?\u201d He expertly stroked blush over my nonexistent cheekbones. I guess he\u2019d watched me do it enough over the years to get the hang of it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m terrified. There\u2019s so much riding on this. Not that I want a music career. I think I\u2019ve finally convinced Ray and Sienna that this is a one-time thing. But what if Mel and Jerry come? The idea of that bitch watching me . . . She could shoot one of her creepy creatures at me when I\u2019m in the middle of a song!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, they\u2019ll be here. Blade called in a favor and asked me to book a table for two next to the dance floor. As for Mel, I\u2019m sure she\u2019s way too aware of her professional reputation to pull a stunt like that.\u201d Rafe frowned at me when I handed him my eyebrow pencil. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I made a mess of my eyebrows.\u201d I should have brought along my computer mirror setup.</p><p>\u201cPretty much. Unless you want to look surprised.\u201d He wiped them off and started over. \u201cBlade sounded like shit, Glory. I actually feel sorry for him.\u201d He laid down the pencil.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s going through hell.\u201d I shuddered. \u201cIt freaks me out that he spends his death sleep in her bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not good. If she decides he\u2019s playing her, she could just stake him in his sleep.\u201d Rafe stood. \u201cShouldn\u2019t have said that. I\u2019m sorry. You have enough on your mind tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, I think about that constantly.\u201d I sighed. \u201cGuess you\u2019d better get out there and take care of business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. The first show was packed. Then we had to empty the place to get ready for this midnight gig.\u201d He was trying not to let me see how happy this made him but I\u2019d known him too long not to pick up on it.</p><p>\u201cSounds like it\u2019s a success. I\u2019m glad for your sake.\u201d I took his hand. \u201cThanks for everything, Rafe. Lacy okay that I\u2019m your date tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. It\u2019s tough though. You should see her in a mermaid costume Aggie would kill for. I\u2019d like to be out there right now beating off the single guys.\u201d He frowned. \u201cI guess she\u2019s punishing me. This better be over soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s got to be. I can\u2019t thank you enough for what you\u2019ve done. As usual.\u201d I managed a smile and let him go. \u201cAll we have to do is get through tonight, get rid of Mel, and maybe we can both have what we want. If I survive this performance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheer up, Glo. I\u2019ve heard you practice. You\u2019ll be dynamite.\u201d He stopped at the door, suddenly very serious. \u201cNow about this deal with Blade. I know you\u2019re trying to trick Mel into thinking you two are through. But as a man who has loved you, I\u2019ve got to tell you, that last song of yours is going to make it impossible for Blade not to show how he really feels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that! We need for her to think he\u2019s over me, Rafe. What was I thinking?\u201d I dropped my face into my hands.</p><p>\u201cYou were thinking that you don\u2019t give in to any woman. You want Blade, you go after him. Voodoo? Forget about it. In a face-off, I\u2019m betting on you.\u201d Rafe leaned against the door.</p><p>\u201cThis is so screwed up.\u201d I raised my head. He was right. I\u2019d never wanted to meekly hand Jerry over to Mel without a fight.</p><p>\u201cPull yourself together, Blondie. You look beautiful. Knock \u2019em dead. I\u2019ll help both of you, any way I can.\u201d He opened the door before I could say another word. \u201cYou have company. I\u2019ll leave you to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Rafe. For everything. It means . . . so much.\u201d I would always love him, as a friend. I pasted on a smile when Flo, Richard next to her, waved at me from the doorway. \u201cCome in, guys. Rafe was just leaving. He\u2019s the one who makes this place run smoothly, you know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt looks like tonight\u2019s a big success, Valdez. The place is packed. We gave up on parking and shifted here. Congratulations.\u201d Richard shook Rafe\u2019s hand then Flo hugged him.</p><p>\u201cYes! I can\u2019t wait to hear our Glory sing. She is good, no?\u201d Flo glanced at me, clearly anxious.</p><p>\u201cOh, she\u2019s great. Just wait till you hear her.\u201d Rafe winked and left, closing the door behind him.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a message from Jeremiah, Glory.\u201d Flo sat on the stool Rafe had vacated. \u201cLove the dress. Designer?\u201d She smiled. \u201cOf course it is. You look perfect except for that lipstick. Here, let me put my new shade on you, Scarlet Woman. It will be amazing under the lights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlo, what message?\u201d I could have cared less about lipstick right then.</p><p>\u201cHold still. Ricardo, you tell her.\u201d Flo carefully wiped away my old lipstick and pulled out liner and a black and gold tube.</p><p>\u201cBlade called me. Said he couldn\u2019t phone you directly.\u201d Richard looked serious.</p><p>\u201cI know. That bitch has him on a short leash.\u201d I wanted to slap Flo\u2019s hand away but finally just let her line my lips.</p> <p>\u201cAnyway, he\u2019ll be here with her tonight. They\u2019ve been together almost every moment since he got back from Miami and he\u2019s finally seen signs that she\u2019s getting tired of him.\u201d</p><p>I had a break while Flo switched to the lipstick. \u201cWhat signs? Did he, um, say how things were going?\u201d I blinked, refusing to cry, but I kept seeing Jerry in that woman\u2019s bed. \u201cIf he and Mel . . .\u201d I couldn\u2019t say it.</p><p>\u201cYou want details? You know he wouldn\u2019t tell me and I certainly wouldn\u2019t ask. It\u2019s better you don\u2019t know, Gloriana.\u201d Richard moved closer and put a hand on my shoulder. \u201cBlade said she asked the spirits for guidance, that kind of nonsense.\u201d If Richard ever rolled his eyes, this would have been the time. Instead, he got very serious. \u201cAnyway, she got a message from the spirit world\u2014her words\u2014that she would get what she deserved. She took it to mean that she would win Blade and triumph over you. You\u2019d think that would make her happy, but Blade read her mind. She\u2019s not satisfied and has started to criticize him constantly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArrogant puttana!\u201d Flo had finished with my lipstick and stabbed the tube back into her silver evening bag. \u201cI have a message for her. She deserves to burn in hell!\u201d She gripped my hand so hard I gasped. \u201cSorry, mia cara amica.\u201d</p><p>I felt a tear roll down my cheek and Flo exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cGlory! Don\u2019t cry and ruin this makeup. That bitch is not worth it. You know Jeremiah\u2019s heart is yours. S\u00ec?\u201d She hurriedly blotted my cheeks when I nodded.</p> <p>\u201cThank God you used waterproof mascara. There now. Tonight that brutta cagna will see that you and Jeremiah are done. She will let the man go and move on. Am I right? That is the plan. S\u00ec?\u201d She looked at Richard then slid her arms around me when I nodded dumbly again, afraid if I tried to speak, I\u2019d break down. \u201cCome now. You mustn\u2019t be upset like this right before your big performance. Promise me.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes and pulled on reserves of strength I hadn\u2019t known I had. Yes, I knew I had Jerry\u2019s heart no matter what that cagna, whatever that meant, had done to him in the meantime. We would settle this tonight, even if one of us had to do something we might regret.</p><p>\u201cI hate this, Flo. Having to go onstage, smile and sing while Jerry is forced to serve that woman and take her abuse.\u201d I shuddered but took comfort from Flo\u2019s gentle touch as she leaned back and patted my shoulder. \u201cBut you\u2019re right. I can handle it. I\u2019ll do what I have to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will all be over soon, amica. You have never looked better and I can\u2019t wait to hear you sing.\u201d Flo stood and reached for her purse again. \u201cForget the woman and enjoy your night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. No one could have a better friend.\u201d I took a hanky from her and touched it to my nose. The linen was exquisite, trimmed in lace with her initials embroidered on it in silver thread. It had a faint scent of jasmine that made me smile. Richard had forbidden Flo to wear perfume because the smell interfered with his defense but she had put a little of her favorite scent on this wisp of perfection.</p><p>I realized I hadn\u2019t even complimented Flo yet and she looked wonderful, dressed in a vintage costume to look like Marie Antoinette. She\u2019d skipped the wig but, knowing Flo, she\u2019d actually worn that very dress to the queen\u2019s court back in the day.</p><p>\u201cLook at me now.\u201d She raised my chin. \u201cPerfetto. Black is your color. Am I right, Ricardo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you look wonderful, Gloriana. Blade will have quite a job keeping his heart from showing in his eyes. But he\u2019s the man who can do it.\u201d He helped Flo to her feet. \u201cWe must go, darling. Gloriana will have things to do before she goes onstage. Everyone at our table wishes you well, my dear. You\u2019ll hear us cheering for you.\u201d He leaned down to lightly kiss my cheek. He\u2019d been trained by Flo not to smudge my makeup. \u201cBreak a leg.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRicardo! What a mean thing to say.\u201d Flo looked indignant.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s traditional, Flo. It means good luck in the theater. Thanks, Richard. And, Flo, you look spectacular. I meant to say that when you walked in.\u201d I stood and shook out my dress.</p><p>\u201cThis old thing.\u201d But she looked pleased. \u201cYou should see Diana. She\u2019s trotted out her same old southern belle costume. The woman still thinks the south will rise again. I swear she\u2019s going to burst into one of Scarlett O\u2019Hara\u2019s famous speeches from Gone With the Wind any minute now and \u2018frankly, my dear, I don\u2019t give a damn.\u2019\u201d</p><p>We laughed and I finally relaxed. What else could I do? How the night would end was anyone\u2019s guess.</p><p>Seventeen</p><p>Flo and Richard left. A few minutes later the door opened again.</p><p>\u201cIan! You should have knocked.\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure if I was glad to see him or not. It depended on the reason for his visit.</p><p>\u201cI was hoping to catch you with your pants down, so to speak.\u201d His grin was wicked. \u201cGuess it\u2019s not my lucky night.\u201d</p><p>I ignored that, not in the mood for his flirting. \u201cHave you brought me a potion Jerry can use against Mel?\u201d I sat down to slip on my black velvet heels.</p><p>\u201cI managed to come up with something. I followed the recipe you gave me.\u201d He moved closer and rubbed my shoulder. \u201cLike the dress. Velvet. Feels good.\u201d He smiled and handed me a small vial. \u201cYou want this now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could have used it days ago. Couldn\u2019t you at least have answered my calls? What took you so long to get it to me?\u201d I knew my nerves were making me short with him, but he was cutting things awfully close.</p><p>\u201cYou know what. My lab was decimated. I had to start many vital experiments over. Thank God Bartholomew O\u2019Connor is almost as smart as I am. He\u2019s been a great help. I\u2019ve persuaded him to stay on for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, at least it\u2019s here now, and thanks. But I\u2019m not who needs it. Jerry should have it. He\u2019s the one stuck next to the voodoo priestess.\u201d I gave the vial back to Ian. \u201cWill you find him in the crowd and slip it to him? Maybe you can arrange to meet him in the men\u2019s room or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in it for me?\u201d Ian looked me over. \u201cYou know I don\u2019t do favors without expecting something in return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I was distracted or I never would have used Ian for anything. Now I saw that calculating look in his eyes that I hated.</p><p>\u201cThe rest of that voodoo book. You have no use for it and I want to study it.\u201d He grinned. \u201cI enjoyed making this potion. If Blade does use it tonight, I hope I\u2019m around to see if it works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you telling me you didn\u2019t test it? That\u2019s not like you.\u201d I was thinking fast. Give Ian a potentially harmful book? I couldn\u2019t like the idea. But I had, gulp, less than five minutes before I had to go onstage.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to test it, but this recipe made precious little after it was distilled and decanted. Look. This is all I\u2019ve got.\u201d He held the glass container up to the light. I could see that it was a shade of mustard yellow and there wasn\u2019t very much of it. \u201cWhat\u2019s it to be, Glory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll find someone else to take it to Jerry. I really don\u2019t trust you with the book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know I have a photographic memory? I saw the cover and the title. I\u2019ll troll the Internet, work my connections, call in favors, but I will get a copy. Eventually. And you might miss your chance to get this vial where it needs to be in time to help Blade.\u201d He tucked it into his pocket. \u201cI warn you, I\u2019m like a dog with a bone when I want something badly enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIan, you\u2019ve just insulted dogs everywhere.\u201d I frowned. \u201cPromise you won\u2019t use any of those potions on me or the ones I love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious. What would be the fun of that?\u201d He glanced at his watch. \u201cDon\u2019t you go onstage in a few minutes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn you! Fine. I\u2019ll give you the book. After this is all over and the woman is gone. Okay?\u201d I pushed him toward the door. \u201cTake it to Jerry now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like those terms. The book is mine no matter how this goes.\u201d He stopped in the doorway. \u201cDeal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you agree that I\u2019m off-limits and so are my people. And don\u2019t pretend you don\u2019t know who I mean. I can play hardball too, Ian.\u201d I snatched the vial from his pocket. \u201cDecide. How badly do you want my copy of the book? It could take you a long time or you might never find one of your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Gloriana. You are most appealing when you negotiate.\u201d He smiled and held out his hand. \u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I laid the vial in his palm. \u201cNow find Jerry and slip that to him. Give him instructions. I\u2019m sure you have some.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. He should toss it in her face if he can manage it while she\u2019s looking directly at him. Once I got the text translated from the Creole language, that\u2019s what it said to do. It should make her hate the sight of him. Not exactly the repellent we thought it would be but I think it will do the trick.\u201d Ian stared down at the potion. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, that should be perfect.\u201d I could tell from the way Ian kept glancing from the potion to me that he\u2019d had another idea. A quick peek into his mind made me sure of it. \u201cStop thinking, Ian. Right now. This is only to be used when Jerry is face-to-face with Mel. No one else is going to use it. Are we clear?\u201d I could see his usual scheming brain at work. \u201cIf anything goes wrong and I hear it was your doing, I\u2019ll burn that book before I give it to you. Or maybe Bart O\u2019Connor would like it. I\u2019m sure he could make a fortune selling potions from it to paranormals around here. Fancy some competition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSettle down, Gloriana. What did I say? Of course I\u2019ll hand it off to Blade.\u201d Ian tried to look innocent. It wasn\u2019t a look he wore well.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll count on that. If this potion works, it\u2019ll solve our problem.\u201d</p> <p>Ian tucked the vial into his jacket pocket. He wasn\u2019t in costume, of course. I couldn\u2019t imagine him relaxing his image enough to play a part other than brainiac doctor. Tonight he had on a black velvet blazer and white silk shirt. The look suited him and women would notice him in a crowd anyway. He stepped into the hall but stopped so abruptly that I bumped into his back.</p><p>\u201cAggie!\u201d I jumped in front of Ian as soon as I saw her. She\u2019d just come out of her dressing room. \u201cUh, you\u2019re not on yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Glory. Good luck tonight.\u201d She smiled, a really fake effort. \u201cIan. I see you came dressed as yourself, the devil.\u201d She literally ran back down the hall toward the restroom before Ian could react.</p><p>\u201cBitch. What\u2019s she doing here?\u201d He was tense where I held his arm.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the backup singer for Ray and Sienna\u2019s set. Remember? I told you. Trust me, she hates that I\u2019ll be in the spotlight and she\u2019s not.\u201d I saw Miguel come out of Aggie\u2019s dressing room and look down the hall. \u201cYou\u2019d better go. Please? Get to Jerry before the lights go down.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine. At least she wished you luck. I do as well.\u201d He kissed my cheek before I could stop him then took off, fortunately away from Miguel.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the man Angel hates so much?\u201d Miguel was beside me in moments.</p><p>\u201cYes. Ian MacDonald. I\u2019m surprised you haven\u2019t crossed paths before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s used my services. We just haven\u2019t met face-to-face. I recognize him from Angel\u2019s description.\u201d He looked me over. \u201cYou are beautiful tonight, Glory. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing and hearing your performance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I gripped the doorjamb. \u201cI just want to get this over with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might be interested to know that Jeremy Blade has arrived here with that voodoo woman you asked me to check out. She\u2019s a minor talent in the dark arts. Yes, she could do you harm. But your powers should be much stronger. Don\u2019t let her intimidate you with her tricks and evil spirits.\u201d He studied his perfectly manicured fingernails.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s Jerry I\u2019m worried about.\u201d I did enjoy hearing that Miguel thought my powers were stronger. So why had I failed to overpower her before? Mind games. I had to be more confident if I got the chance to confront her again.</p><p>\u201cYou should be. He\u2019s dressed as her slave.\u201d He glanced up and his face was grim. \u201cHe allowed her to lead him into the club in shackles. She was pulling him by a chain around his neck. The man has lost his pride, Glory. I would kill a woman who treated me so disrespectfully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you would. But it\u2019s an act, Miguel. We\u2019re trying to get her to lose interest in him. Jerry learned that it\u2019s her pattern. She doesn\u2019t want what she thinks she\u2019s captured.\u201d I hated that Jerry had let people\u2014our friends, my mother\u2014see him like that.</p><p>\u201cThat plan sucks.\u201d Miguel turned and walked away.</p><p>I wanted to call him back, say something to defend Jerry, but Ray emerged from the dressing room across from me, all smiles.</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s time, Glory girl. You ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in a million years.\u201d I took his hand though and walked with him toward the stage. I could hear the band playing the intro to the song we\u2019d arranged to start the set with. The drums were sounding out a great beat and I could feel it from my toes to my tummy. I had to do this. I wanted to do it. Ray and I hurried up onto the stage to thunderous applause, screams and cheers. It had started. There was no turning back now.</p><p>The lights were still bright enough in the club that I could see the audience from the stage. I knew it would be darker as soon as I started my second song. I was singing my duet with Ray before I knew it, all that practice making it easier than I\u2019d thought it would be. I could even scan the room while we sang.</p> <p>There was the group of my friends on the balcony. Flo grinned and waved. As one, the gang raised their glasses full of a ruby liquid that I knew was blood and sent me a silent toast. I licked my lips while Ray took his turn in the song. I really should have fed or at least finished my glass of synthetic before coming onstage.</p><p>\u201cWhenever I call you friend . . .\u201d Ray and I sang together. The song was full of meaning for both of us. Yes, we were friends and would always love each other on some level. The fast beat made it a fun way to start the set and the packed crowd on the dance floor moved to the music, everyone smiling and seeming to enjoy themselves.</p><p>I grinned, jazzed by their reaction. I hadn\u2019t spotted Jerry yet but another glance at the balcony made it impossible to miss my mother\u2019s table. She was reigning like a queen over her court. A queen of Olympus. My God, they\u2019d all come dressed in their togas. All except Mom\u2019s date for the evening. Mars was in full battle regalia. At least he\u2019d taken off his helmet with the red plume and it was sitting on the table. I recognized Circe, the goddess who\u2019d made sure Jerry had found me back in London centuries ago so that he\u2019d give me immortality. Apparently that had earned her a seat at the table. She and Mom hadn\u2019t always been friends, but they\u2019d forged a bond over their mutual hatred of Achelous the Storm God.</p><p>Ray and I leaned in. We were coming close to the end of our song when I saw Jerry. He and Mel were at the edge of the dance floor. Damn, but Mel was leading him around by a chain. His buff body couldn\u2019t have looked better in what was little more than a leather loin cloth belted at the waist with a wide studded belt. With his powerful chest and legs bare, he drew eyes in a crowd where more than one person had gone for a skimpy look. Then I saw the choke collar around his neck.</p><p>My proud Highlander wore a choke collar. I wanted to cry or scream or throw up. What I didn\u2019t want to do was sing. Good thing I was on autopilot by now.</p><p>When she caught my eye Mel smiled and gave the chain a tug. I looked away from Jerry, trying not to add to his humiliation, but I couldn\u2019t help myself. One more glance. How was he taking this? He wouldn\u2019t look up at me, just kept staring at the woman in front of him. Oh, God, Jerry. My heart was breaking for him.</p><p>Ray nudged me with an arm around my waist and I realized I\u2019d dropped the ball, forgotten to come in when it was my turn in the song. I quickly focused again as we came to the final chorus.</p><p>\u201cI know forever we\u2019ll be doin\u2019 it right.\u201d I looked into Ray\u2019s eyes and saw sympathy. It was almost my undoing. Of course he\u2019d noticed Jerry and Mel. Sing, Glory. We harmonized, in sync, as we sang the final notes. Friends. Thank God for them. Ray had his arm around me, supporting me in more ways than one, as we took a bow.</p><p>The applause was deafening and the building shook with the sound of stomping feet. Then the lights went out for mere seconds. It was enough to quiet the crowd before twin spotlights hit me and Ray, who was now sitting at his piano. He nodded and the band started my first solo. I wasn\u2019t about to sing to Jerry, though in my heart this song was for him. So I leaned on the piano for the opening notes, deliberately sultry as I sang to Ray.</p><p>\u201cYou give me fever.\u201d</p><p>The crowd went wild. I\u2019m sure they thought that meant Ray and I were an item again. Whatever. Ray certainly knew we weren\u2019t. Working together had been fun, but he realized there was no romantic future for us. I sashayed around the stage, putting a wiggle into my walk and holding the microphone like Ray had taught me. He\u2019d been a wonderful musical mentor.</p><p>\u201cFever all through the night.\u201d Oh, yeah. I was selling that song. It was an oldie, but had a timeless message. I thought about Jerry and the first time we\u2019d been together. We\u2019d been so hot for each other. Ridiculous but we were still that way. He could touch me and I\u2019d go up in flames. I put that feeling into the song and became almost breathless.</p><p>I could feel hundreds, maybe a thousand pairs of eyes on me. It was a heady experience. The room was silent except for the band and my voice. This was a new kind of power. I should be getting off to it. But I\u2019d had too many years of trying not to be noticed. All this attention and a roomful of mortals only a few feet away . . .</p><p>My fangs started to come down and I fought them back. No, no, no. With the spotlight in my eyes, I couldn\u2019t see anyone out there but they sure as hell could see me. Jerry, my friends and my mother who was either proud or horrified, take your pick, they were all out there watching my every move.</p><p>That rush of power suddenly evaporated and I wanted to run and hide. I couldn\u2019t. The only thing I could do was stroll over to Ray again and touch his shoulder. Get strength from him. His smile encouraged me and he sent me a mental message to just sing. That I had the audience in the palm of my hand. I squeezed his shoulder, trusting him, and kept going.</p><p>By the time I came to the end of the song, I knew Ray was right. I\u2019d made it through and no one had a clue I\u2019d been close to a meltdown. Ray\u2019s grin as he played the final notes said it all. He was proud of me. I was Gloriana the Siren as I worked my hips and stood behind him at the piano to sing that last line, twining my fingers in his hair. Finally, I leaned forward and blew in his ear. I was an actress and I\u2019d played my part. It hadn\u2019t been comfortable, but I\u2019d survived.</p><p>The crowd loved it, especially when he jumped up, grabbed me and gave me one of those big fake Hollywood kisses that leaned me back over his arm. We hadn\u2019t rehearsed it but the moment was right. We both came up laughing, Ray fanning himself like he did have a fever. The applause was deafening as the lights came up briefly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen, Gloriana St. Clair!\u201d Ray held my hand while I took a bow. He let the applause roll over us for a few moments then held up his hand for quiet.</p><p>\u201cNow for her final number, if you\u2019ve got a light on your phone or a lighter, let\u2019s see it. I think you\u2019re going to get a kick out of this. It\u2019s a special song for Halloween. Are you ready?\u201d</p><p>There was a howl of agreement as hundreds of lights came on until the room looked like a mass of twinkling stars when the overhead dimmed again. I had enough light to see Jerry\u2019s reaction to this song, if I could still find him in the crowd. I waved at the audience then nodded to the band. Ray sat back at the piano, all of us waiting for the mood to hit the room as the drums throbbed and the music started. It was a really old song but perfect for the night.</p> <p>\u201cI put a spell on you . . .\u201d I wanted to sing straight to Jerry, but didn\u2019t dare. Not when the next line made it clear I considered him \u201cmine.\u201d I put everything I had into the song. I wanted Mel to think that, despite my act with Rafe, I was pining for Jerry. She could kill chickens in my shop and examine the insides of a thousand goats, but she\u2019d never deserve Jerry. I\u2019d cast my own spell on him centuries ago. A love spell. He\u2019d been mine first, would always be mine. Mel had come way too late to the party.</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t goin\u2019 to take none of your foolin\u2019 around.\u201d Was Mel laughing at that? Sure of herself and her ritual sacrifice? Was she gloating and tugging on Jerry\u2019s chain? If I could have reached her, I would have wrapped that chain around her neck and squeezed the life out of her. What would her ghosts and ghouls think about that?</p><p>I forced myself to slink over to Ray and aim some of my smolder at him. I could probably still put a spell on him and end up in his bed tonight. His bright blue eyes telegraphed that message loud and clear. I shook my head as I fell back across the piano like I was making love to it, just short of giving Ray a glimpse down my vee-neck. Too much of that wouldn\u2019t be fair to the man. On the next line I was up again and making love to the audience instead.</p><p>I noticed couples entwined, dancing to the slow pulsing beat. Ray\u2019s lead guitarist had fallen in love with the song and had worked up a fantastic solo that showed off his skill. He sounded great and I stood aside, swaying as he worked the electric guitar strings.</p><p>It gave me a chance to scan the audience again. What I saw made me swallow. No! This couldn\u2019t be happening. Jerry was pushing his way toward the stage, carefully moving aside dancing couples as he strode closer and closer, his eyes on me now. The chain Mel had been flaunting earlier was wrapped around his fist. Mel stumbled along behind him, trying not to trip because the cuff at her wrist was connected to the other end of that chain. Was he crazy? This wasn\u2019t the plan.</p> <p>I realized my cue was coming. I had to sing again and I knew what I had to do. Okay, change of plans. I\u2019d sing to the man I loved and put my trust in Jerry and that potion I hoped to hell he had handy.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re mine.\u201d I couldn\u2019t have made it any clearer as I sang straight to him. Jerry was close to the stage now. He took the chain in both hands and broke it like it was a toy made of plastic. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s what the mortals close by thought. I could see Mel\u2019s face clearly now. She was livid. So much for showing off her love slave. The last note lingered in the air, the lights went out and I gasped when Jerry leaped up onto the stage and swept me into his arms.</p><p>\u201cDamn right, I\u2019m yours and nobody else\u2019s.\u201d He kissed me and kept kissing me, even when the lights came on and the audience went into a frenzy.</p><p>I didn\u2019t push him away. Couldn\u2019t. His strong arms were my safe haven. His mouth on mine gave me the very air I didn\u2019t have to breathe but yearned for anyway. When Jerry finally pulled back, he glanced at the audience and seemed to realize that he was stealing my big moment.</p><p>\u201cTake a bow, Gloriana. You were incredible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right, she was.\u201d Ray stood on my other side. \u201cGet off my stage, Blade.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCalm down. The audience loved it. They thought it was part of the show.\u201d I said this as an aside to Ray, bowing as the audience cheered, whistled and stomped their feet. I gestured toward the guitarist and he took his own bow. Then I held up Ray\u2019s hand and kissed his cheek.</p><p>Before Ray could say another word, I dropped his hand and dragged Jerry off the stage, toward the dressing rooms. We paused next to Aggie and Sienna, who stood waiting in the wings, ready to go onstage to do their set. Aggie ignored me.</p><p>\u201cGreat job, Glory.\u201d Sienna grinned and gave me a thumbs-up. \u201cBlade, that was some surprise at the end. Good showmanship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may regret it.\u201d He looked down at me. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t help myself. I had to follow my heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJerry.\u201d I brushed his cheek. \u201cWhat about Mel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sick to death of that woman and that charade. We\u2019ll deal with the fallout together.\u201d He pulled the vial from his belt where he\u2019d had it tucked next to his skin. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll see her again before the night is out. If this works, problem solved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you two move out of the way? Miguel says there\u2019s a big producer in the audience.\u201d Aggie had on a costume that hadn\u2019t come from my shop. It was an expensive harem outfit that complemented Sienna\u2019s but was in the green that Aggie loved. It revealed more than it concealed and had enough jewels in the trim to catch the spotlight. She was sure to be noticed.</p><p>\u201cRelax, Aggie. Ray has a solo first, remember?\u201d Sienna frowned at her. \u201cI thought I told you to lose the headband. I\u2019m the star here. You\u2019re background.\u201d She reached out and snatched a jeweled piece off Aggie\u2019s hair. \u201cNow, don\u2019t screw around up there. The producer will ask me if I think you\u2019ll be easy to work with. If he\u2019s interested. You want a good recommendation, do as we\u2019ve practiced.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI get it, Sienna. I\u2019m sorry. Miguel made me wear that thing.\u201d Aggie looked anxiously down the hall. \u201cI do what he tells me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Jerry kept his arm around me and I leaned into him. \u201cYou and Miguel, Aggie? Isn\u2019t he that hit man, Glory? The one who works for Lucky Carver?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Let it go, Jer. Aggie has made it clear that she doesn\u2019t want or need our help. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. I\u2019m fine. After tonight, I might even be on the fast track to a record deal.\u201d She cocked her head. \u201cThere\u2019s our cue, Sienna.\u201d She followed Sienna to the stage. \u201cWish us luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck.\u201d I turned to Jerry. \u201cI\u2019d like to see her get a record deal. Maybe head to Hollywood to record it. Far away sounds good to me.\u201d I pulled him toward my dressing room. I wanted some alone time with my guy.</p><p>\u201cYou want to stay out here and listen to the music?\u201d Jerry offered. I knew he could care less about it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard it all week during rehearsals. Come into my dressing room. Tell me about your week.\u201d I followed him into the room and shut the door.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it. I\u2019m done with that woman now, whether she wants me or not.\u201d He looked away, not meeting my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you had to go through that.\u201d I slid my arms around him. We obviously weren\u2019t going to touch the subject of whether or not he\u2019d had sex with Mel. Did I want to know? Could I handle the truth if it wasn\u2019t what I wanted to hear? Maybe not knowing was for the best. I was dropping it. And I sure wasn\u2019t going to read his mind.</p><p>He rested his cheek on my hair. \u201cGod, it feels good just to hold you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you do it, Jer? Why\u2019d you come up onstage when we\u2019d planned . . .\u201d I studied his dear face. He looked tired. Vampires weren\u2019t supposed to have circles under their eyes. It made me wonder if Mel had tampered with his blood again.</p><p>\u201cSimple. You must have known it when you picked that song. You did put a spell on me. Centuries ago, Gloriana. Seeing you up there, looking so beautiful. Hearing your voice, golden and pure. It was like falling in love all over again. How could I just stand there, shackled to that insane creature when the woman I really wanted was just feet away? I moved before I could stop myself.\u201d He ran his thumb across my lips. \u201cGod, how I\u2019ve missed you.\u201d He leaned down and kissed me, his mouth moving over mine for endless moments.</p><p>I sighed into his mouth, reveling in his taste again and having him this close. When we finally parted, I stared into his eyes. \u201cYou took a big chance, Jer. I expected to see ghosts and ghouls any moment when you jumped on that stage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou missed them? They were there. I guess the spotlight blinded you.\u201d He grinned. \u201cWhen I started dragging her toward the stage, Mel went into her usual death-will-get-you mode. I felt the cold fingers of her familiars all around me. The crowd loved it. They thought they were special effects Valdez had managed to produce. Part of your song.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding. But you kept coming.\u201d I held him close, listening to the slow thump of his barely beating heart as I pressed my cheek to his chest.</p><p>\u201cNot even Viking berserkers could have held me back, Gloriana.\u201d He rubbed my back. \u201cYou\u2019re everything to me. I had to get closer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you, we, don\u2019t regret it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I,\u201d he said as the dressing room door flew open.</p><p>Eighteen</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better get out here, Blade. That woman is a nightmare.\u201d Rafe actually looked frazzled. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever seen him that way.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s she doing?\u201d I didn\u2019t want Jerry anywhere near her, though he\u2019d started toward the door anyway. \u201cStop. Wait, Jer. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s unleashed what I\u2019m thinking are the hounds of hell. And she\u2019s got two creepy people with her who I swear are zombies. Ray and Sienna are in the middle of their set and Mel is disturbing the crowd. At least on her side of the stage. When I sent some of my bigger guys over there to move her, they couldn\u2019t even touch her. She froze them out somehow.\u201d Rafe moved when Jerry pushed past him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen her do this. I hope your customers are still thinking it\u2019s a light show you put on as part of the entertainment. As for the zombies? Mel won\u2019t let them act out in public. Trouble will start if anyone tries to push her around.\u201d Jerry shoved aside a curtain and looked out at the crowd.</p><p>I peered around him. Sure enough, we could see Mel waving her arms. She totally ignored the music, the singers on the stage and the hundreds of dancers milling around her. She was obviously trying to find Jerry. She must have sensed him because she whipped her head around and glared in our direction. When she pointed at us, I felt an immediate chill.</p><p>\u201cGet back here, Jerry. Please. We can\u2019t have a confrontation in the middle of that crowd.\u201d I grabbed his arm. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t toss the potion at her there and take a chance that your arm will be jostled and you\u2019ll miss.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGlory\u2019s right. We need to take this outside.\u201d Rafe pulled the curtain closed. \u201cCome on. Go out the side door. Mel will just have to follow you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and I\u2019m sure she will.\u201d Jerry glanced back at the drawn curtain. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Valdez. This night is important to you and my problems are ruining it.\u201d I could tell he meant it.</p><p>\u201cNot at all. You saw the crowd. The people closest to her were a little freaked out, but then they just moved away and kept dancing to the music.\u201d He glanced at the stage. \u201cRay and Sienna are pros. They\u2019re ignoring the disturbance and have never missed a note. Those creepy apparitions floating over Mel\u2019s head look like a cool lighting effect if you don\u2019t know that they\u2019re the real deal. Even the zombies could be bankers who\u2019ve marinated too long.\u201d</p><p>Jerry put his arm around me. \u201cNo kidding. Their blood smells fermented. Nasty. And those ghouls are certainly real to Mel. The woman speaks to them constantly. Right now she\u2019s probably getting ready to make me pay for leaving her like I did. And she\u2019s going to want to hurt Gloriana too.\u201d He stopped at my dressing room door. \u201cLock yourself in here, my love. I\u2019ll be back once I\u2019ve taken care of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me? Don\u2019t you know me better than that by now, Jer?\u201d I poked him in his bare chest. \u201cI\u2019d never let you face her alone. We\u2019re going out to the alley together.\u201d I turned to Rafe. \u201cIf she comes through here, tell her that\u2019s where we\u2019ll be. We need to get her away from the show.\u201d We\u2019d kept our voices down but I didn\u2019t want to take a chance that we\u2019d disturb the performers onstage.</p> <p>\u201cThe alley, Gloriana? Why are you going there? You should come up to the balcony. Meet my handmaidens.\u201d My mother had appeared in the hallway. \u201cDarling, you were absolutely brilliant.\u201d She dabbed at her eyes with a handkerchief. \u201cI was so proud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mother. Later. After I deal with a little problem, I\u2019ll come up and meet everyone. Say hi to Mars for me.\u201d I tugged Jerry toward the exit. \u201cQuiet. Remember, there\u2019s still a show going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this? Introduce me to this fellow, Gloriana.\u201d Mars suddenly stood behind my mother. \u201cI must judge if he\u2019s worthy of you. Since you have no father to vet your suitors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think I\u2019m old enough to skip such customs?\u201d I smiled though as I finally got the group outside. \u201cI\u2019m touched at your concern. Mars, this is Jeremiah Campbell, currently known as Jeremy Blade. He and I are a couple. With or without your approval I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGloriana! It would be wise of you to indulge us. Mars could certainly give you good advice and is an excellent judge of men.\u201d My mother looked Jerry over from his head down to his toes which looked nicely masculine in leather sandals. \u201cSo am I. He does cut a fine figure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe physical form is the least important aspect of a man, my dear Hebe. It\u2019s his substance that must be of worth.\u201d Mars studied Jerry from beneath lowered brows. \u201cI did like the way he charged the stage. Broke that chain and went right up to Gloriana. Took her away from that singer who struck me as a lightweight. Glad you\u2019re not taking him as your lover, Gloriana.\u201d Mars patted my shoulder. \u201cBut coming in on a leash, as it were, Campbell. Not well done of you, my man. Not at all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf it helps my cause, I hated every minute of it.\u201d Jerry\u2019s shoulders were back, his jaw stiff. \u201cIt was part of a scheme Gloriana and I\u2019d set up. Stupid now that I think back on it. If you\u2019ll excuse us, we were about to finish things with that bitch who led me in.\u201d He nodded as if he\u2019d dismissed the god. Mars stopped him with a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHold. I didn\u2019t say I don\u2019t like you for Gloriana. Of course I know you\u2019re vampire. But so\u2019s the girl. Damnable thing, but she seems used to the blood drinking.\u201d Mars took my hand in his other one. \u201cPerhaps you two are well suited. You strike me as a warrior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. Was. When it meant something to be handy with a weapon.\u201d Jerry shrugged away from Mars\u2019s touch. I was surprised the god let him. \u201cThese days I have little use for the old ways. It\u2019s more important to be clever. This mess with the voodoo woman should have been resolved long ago. Somehow we weren\u2019t clever enough for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, by Zeus\u2019s right hand, I say we all stay out here and have a little fun with her. I\u2019d like to see her fight all of us with her dark powers.\u201d Mars linked arms with my mother. \u201cWhat do you say, Hebe? Are you up for a little witch hunt?\u201d He finally let go of my hand. I felt released in more ways than one. His touch had paralyzed my body and my tongue. Now I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take all the help we can get,\u201d Jerry said when the back door opened and Rafe signaled before going back inside. \u201cI think she\u2019s coming.\u201d He scanned the alley, shoving aside a pile of wooden crates and positioning himself with his back to a Dumpster.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the plan?\u201d Mars was suddenly wearing his helmet, the red plume waving above us all.</p><p>\u201cI have a potion that\u2019s supposed to make her hate me on sight. As soon as I\u2019m sure I have an open shot at tossing it in her face, I\u2019m taking it.\u201d Jerry held the vial in his hand. \u201cGloriana, I wish you\u2019d stay behind those crates since you insist on being here for this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy daughter isn\u2019t one to cower in the shadows, Blade.\u201d My mother stood proudly next to Mars. \u201cWhy does everyone here on Earth have such absurd names?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet over it, Mother. Are you just here to fuss about trivialities?\u201d I touched her hand. \u201cSorry, I\u2019m stressed. Thanks for the compliments. About the singing and not cowering. You\u2019re right. I guess I do have a little goddess in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than a little, darling.\u201d She looked very pleased then wrinkled her nose. \u201cOh, what have we here? Zombies? Honestly, Blade, Gloriana should have dismissed you just for consorting with such disgusting creatures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother!\u201d I had to admit, the reek warned us that Mel was getting closer and she hadn\u2019t even emerged from the building yet.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have them with her during her seminars,\u201d Jerry grumbled.</p><p>\u201cWell, they\u2019re here now. And your friend that shifter is here too, Gloriana. You do inspire loyalty, don\u2019t you?\u201d My mother smiled at me proudly. \u201cSay the word if you want me to use a lightning bolt on the woman. It would be my pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d I braced myself, startled when Jerry swept me behind him despite my protests. The exit door crashed back when Mel charged out, surrounded by screaming banshees, her two zombies shuffling along behind her. They had deteriorated badly since the last time I\u2019d seen them. It made me wonder what their shelf life was.</p><p>\u201cThere you are. What in the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d She stopped inches from Jerry.</p><p>I waited for him to toss the potion then and there. Instead he seemed frozen in place.</p><p>\u201cHow dare you embarrass me by running away!\u201d She swept her arm in a circle. He shuddered and fell to his knees.</p><p>\u201cJerry!\u201d I dropped down beside him. \u201cWhat have you done to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me incinerate her, Gloriana. I can blast her to ashes right now.\u201d Mars grinned and stepped forward. \u201cVoodoo. Child\u2019s games.\u201d</p><p>Mel\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cI don\u2019t know who or what you are, but I wouldn\u2019t taunt the spirits if I were you.\u201d</p><p>I stood when it became obvious that Jerry couldn\u2019t move or speak. \u201cI asked what you did to Jerry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little spell I put on him.\u201d She laughed, the cackle of a crazy woman. \u201cI took his blood while he slept. Used it to make a powerful conjure. You and your song. Pathetic. How you wish you had my kind of power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy \u2018spell\u2019 is love, freely given. Something you will never understand. What you do is evil.\u201d I quit breathing when her zombies lumbered closer. I avoided their dead eyes. My mother watched them closely and I had a feeling if one of them had reached for me, she would have zapped it with a few thousand watts of lightning.</p><p>Mel screeched and her ghostly minions flew about my head, making a mess of my hair and hitting my arms. My mother shouted and would have jumped into the fray but I signaled her to stay out of it.</p><p>\u201cJerry doesn\u2019t love you, Melisandra. Let him go.\u201d I made myself say that calmly even though all the dead things whirling around me were seriously freaking me out.</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d She smiled, obviously proud of herself. \u201cWhile Jeremiah slept, dead to the world, I spoke to Loa and used my most powerful charms to bind this man to me. Yes, I used his true name. Jeremiah Campbell. He gave it to me. That\u2019s how much he loves me. See? You are wrong.\u201d She swept me aside and knelt in front of Jerry, running her fingers through his hair.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch him.\u201d I wanted to jerk her back, make her scream in pain. But her sharp red nails were inches from his eyes. Would she hurt him to hurt me? I couldn\u2019t take that chance. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy love. I\u2019ve done much more than touch him, vampire. He craves me and my hot blood, pulsing with life. That\u2019s something you can\u2019t give him, can you?\u201d She gazed at me triumphantly. \u201cNo, I\u2019m sure your blood is cold and dead.\u201d</p><p>I just stared at her. What could I say? Jerry had admitted he liked hot mortal blood. But from her? I doubted he could stand the taste of it anymore. I didn\u2019t dare provoke her so I stayed silent.</p><p>\u201cI see you don\u2019t deny it. And just look at what he gave me.\u201d She held out her left hand and I gasped. It was the engagement ring Jerry had offered me months before.</p> <p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t give you that. You stole it.\u201d I remembered what Miguel had said. I had the power. I read her mind. Of course she\u2019d stolen it. She\u2019d crept into Jerry\u2019s house during the day while everyone staying there, all vampires, had been in their death sleep. Thank God she\u2019d left without hurting any of them.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see you wearing his ring, do I, Gloriana?\u201d Mel shot a triumphant look around the alley. \u201cNo! He hasn\u2019t claimed her as his woman. I\u2019ve claimed him now. Jeremiah Campbell is mine. And he\u2019s just where I want him.\u201d She backed up and pointed a bloodred fingernail at me. \u201cYou, Gloriana, you have nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want him helpless?\u201d Tears stung my eyes just before I threw myself at her. I had surprise on my side and she didn\u2019t have time to protect herself. She fell back, her dead spirits vanishing when I wrapped my hands around her throat and began to squeeze. \u201cTake it off, take off this horrible spell you\u2019ve put on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should I?\u201d She wheezed, the life draining out of her. I didn\u2019t care if she was dying or not. I couldn\u2019t ease up on her throat, not even when her face turned red. \u201cK-k-kill me and he\u2019ll never be yours again.\u201d She glanced at her zombies. \u201cAttack! Take her out!\u201d</p><p>There was a sizzle and a pop and the smell of something nasty burning. My mother blew on her gold-lacquered fingernail as if it were a gun barrel.</p> <p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t going to be attacking anyone. Get her, Gloriana.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t have time to see what Mother had done because I was too busy trying to squeeze answers out of Mel. I kept holding her throat but let up enough to shake her, knocking her head against the concrete.</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Tell me why he won\u2019t be mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not telling you anything.\u201d She gasped and waved her arms wildly, trying to summon her spirits. I trapped one arm under each knee, straddling her.</p><p>\u201cStop it. Now tell me what you\u2019ve done to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll always belong to me, heart and soul. There are words that must be spoken or he won\u2019t ever love another.\u201d Her eyes were wild, her smile triumphant. \u201cYou\u2019d better believe I won\u2019t speak them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t yours a few minutes ago. He came to me on the stage. He said he loved me.\u201d I snarled, let her see my fangs and the urge to kill in my eyes.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019d failed to mark him. But I did just now. Look and see. He carries my mark and will be mine forever or until my mark is removed.\u201d She was still defiant, even though I could almost see the life draining out of her with each gasp as I tightened my grip on her throat.</p><p>\u201cGo, Gloriana. See if she\u2019s telling the truth. I\u2019ve got this.\u201d My mother touched Mel and she was instantly paralyzed. \u201cSee if you can find this mark she\u2019s bragging about. We will make her take it off. No matter what we have to do to her.\u201d Mother\u2019s smile was cold and determined.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t have a better ally. I glanced at the zombies. Or what used to be the walking dead. Now they were two piles of ashes.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do to help?\u201d Rafe was there beside my mother.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let anyone come into the alley. Can you stay by the door?\u201d I\u2019d been worried about that. This bizarre scene didn\u2019t need any spectators or distractions.</p><p>Rafe helped me to my feet. \u201cYou can count on me.\u201d He squeezed my shoulder then rushed to stand against the door.</p><p>I ran back to Jerry. Mark. I hadn\u2019t seen her touch him but maybe she could have thrown something or her spirits might have been capable of carrying it. Did I even believe her? But she\u2019d done something to make him first freeze, then fall unconscious to the ground. Then I looked closer. He wasn\u2019t unconscious. He stared at nothing, now just like one of her walking dead. Oh, God.</p> <p>\u201cGloriana, let me help.\u201d Mars stood next to me.</p><p>\u201cHow? Do you know anything about these voodoo curses?\u201d I ran my hands over Jerry\u2019s shoulders and back. I knew his body so well. If there was anything new here, I wasn\u2019t finding it.</p><p>\u201cLoa. Melisandra claims she talked to Loa. Believe it or not, that\u2019s one of my other names. This religion is one of my minor ones. I am a god, you know. Some people choose to worship me. Gods of war are popular. We have power and that appeals to people. But I don\u2019t like it when their worship is twisted like this.\u201d He frowned at Mel where Mother stood guard over her.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019d say Mel\u2019s gone off the deep end.\u201d I still hadn\u2019t found a mark. Where could it be?</p><p>\u201cThis woman has invoked my power and abused it in a way that displeases me.\u201d He lifted Jerry to his feet, making it look effortless. \u201cCheck out his upper right thigh, under that loin cloth. That\u2019s where such marks are usually found.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe . . .\u201d I shook my head. \u201cNever mind. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever figure out Olympus and all the bizarre happenings there.\u201d I sank down to study Jerry\u2019s thigh, tracing an old scar. He\u2019d won it in a battle centuries ago, before he\u2019d been turned. There, just inches above the edge of that skimpy leather, was a small black mark like a brand. It looked like an x, with the bottom turned into an upside down heart. I rubbed my finger over it and it throbbed, hot to the touch.</p><p>\u201cThis must be it. Can you take it off?\u201d I wished Jerry would moan, something. Instead, when Mars let him go, he just slumped in place, like a puppet left to hang from a hook by its strings.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid, my dear, that only the one who puts on the mark can remove it.\u201d He stalked over to Mel. \u201cLet her up, Hebe.\u201d He stood glowering down at the priestess.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d My mother frowned down at the frozen woman. \u201cI could end her here and now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd leave Jerry like this? I don\u2019t think so. Thaw her out, Mother, and back off. Please?\u201d I stood next to Mars.</p><p>\u201cI hope you know what you\u2019re doing, both of you.\u201d She tapped Mel then moved back. Mel jumped up, wild-eyed.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d She raised her arms, ready to bring in the ghouls.</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d Mars fixed her with a commanding gaze. \u201cI am Loa, the god to whom you pray. Do you know me, my child?\u201d His voice had gone deep and guttural. It made my insides quiver.</p><p>Mel fell to her knees. \u201cMy lord Loa. You honor me.\u201d She bowed until her forehead touched the rough pavement. \u201cHow can I serve you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemove your mark from this man, daughter. Set him free. Your attachment to a blood drinker does not please me. Have you not learned that we despise such creatures?\u201d Mars stalked around Mel in a circle.</p><p>\u201cHow can that be your wish when you helped me gain his love in the first place?\u201d Mel hadn\u2019t looked up, and said this to the pavement.</p><p>Mars sighed. He touched the top of her head and she froze again. \u201cThis is what comes from having so many supplicants. I should listen more closely to their pleas. Get a few more assistants to handle incoming calls. If I\u2019d known it concerned you, Gloriana . . .\u201d He shrugged. \u201cWell, this is a tough one. I\u2019m not supposed to intervene once I\u2019ve given the green light.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me talk to her. Like Jerry said, we have this potion. If he can thaw out and then toss it at her, it\u2019s supposed to make Mel hate him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it called?\u201d Mars gestured. \u201cLet me look at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t pronounce the name but here it is.\u201d I slipped it out from behind Jerry\u2019s belt.</p><p>Mars opened the vial and sniffed. \u201cGood news. This will work. Talk her into thawing out the man and then, if he throws it in her face while she\u2019s looking straight into his eyes, it will make her despise him. She\u2019ll take off the mark willingly, unable to bear the sight of him carrying it.\u201d He glanced at my mother. \u201cHebe, we need to get out of here. The woman will be insufferable if she remembers Loa himself deigned to speak to her. I think Gloriana can handle things from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you, dear?\u201d My mother glared at Mel. \u201cI don\u2019t like leaving you with that woman. She means you harm. And of course she\u2019s taken her religion to a very dark place. Sorry, Mars.\u201d She linked her arm through his. \u201cPerhaps I can comfort you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind that at all. But we must go back inside. I saw someone I think I recognize. You must tell me if I am right or not.\u201d He smiled at her. \u201cGloriana? I\u2019ll erase her memory of ever meeting me. Are you happy with this plan? Sure you can carry it off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to get her to thaw him out. Jerry knows what to do with the potion. Unless what she\u2019s done to him will erase that memory.\u201d</p><p>Mars walked over to Jerry and stared at him intently. \u201cI think he\u2019ll be fine. Inside his muddled brain he knows two things. He loves you and hates that bitch. I take that to mean this Melisandra.\u201d He swept his gaze over her one more time. \u201cGood thing Hebe didn\u2019t incinerate her. She\u2019s one of my priestesses. From now on, I\u2019ll pay closer attention to what\u2019s going on down here. In the future, this woman will have a rude awakening. Loa will come to her in her dreams and she\u2019ll see the light, so to speak. Voodoo is a fine religion when practiced properly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad to hear it. Now please go. I can\u2019t stand to see Jerry like this.\u201d I brushed my lover\u2019s cheek but he didn\u2019t move a muscle. Finally I tucked the open vial into his hand and sent him a mental message, reminding him what it was for. I tried to read his mind but I wasn\u2019t as powerful as Mars because I couldn\u2019t make the connection. \u201cReady.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll release her, and your mother and I will vanish at the same time. Good luck, Gloriana.\u201d He touched Mel and, true to his word, he and Mother disappeared.</p><p>\u201cHow do you like Jeremiah now, Gloriana?\u201d Mel was back in her usual bitingly sarcastic form.</p><p>\u201cYou can have him. When I think of all the nights you two were together it makes me sick. Yes, it was cool that he came up onstage like that. I couldn\u2019t have planned it better myself. It made for great theater. But, honestly? Why would I want your leftovers?\u201d I shrugged and started toward the exit door where Rafe had been a silent observer. \u201cHere\u2019s my guy. Rafe, baby, can you take me somewhere not polluted by evil spirits and crazy women?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure, Glo.\u201d Rafe pulled me close. \u201cMel, enjoyed the pep talk the other night. Gave me lots to think about. Big plans for the club here for instance. Glory and I may come to another one of your seminars. You give great advice. We left there totally inspired, didn\u2019t we, baby?\u201d He kissed my cheek.</p><p>\u201cI admit it. I want to own the world.\u201d I patted Rafe\u2019s butt. \u201cI hear the music\u2019s still going. Let\u2019s go inside and dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll take your money.\u201d Mel turned to Jerry and waved her hands again. \u201cJeremiah, lover. Are you ready to go?\u201d She stared into his eyes.</p><p>\u201cMore than ready.\u201d He tossed the liquid in the vial into her face.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d Mel\u2019s screech would have been heard inside except Ray\u2019s band was loud enough to hear through the closed door. She wiped away the liquid, which looked like egg yolk, from her eyes and face. \u201cThis burns! What the hell is it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA little something a doctor I know whipped up in his lab. It\u2019s supposed to be a love potion. What have I done? I\u2019ve shown you just how I feel about you.\u201d Jerry watched her closely as she pulled a black handkerchief from between her breasts. She\u2019d worn what I\u2019m sure the audience had thought was a costume but were probably her work clothes when she was talking to Loa. The floor-length black caftan plunged low in front and her headscarf had symbols in gold around the edge.</p><p>\u201cLeave the potions to the experts, Jeremiah. Clearly you were tricked.\u201d She looked him over, her lips curling. \u201cHow pathetic. What did I ever see in you? A bloodsucker.\u201d She shuddered.</p><p>\u201cYou said you liked for me to drink your blood, Mel.\u201d Jerry smiled, showing every inch of his very long fangs.</p><p>\u201cNo! I seem to remember . . .\u201d She put a shaky hand to her forehead. \u201cBy Loa\u2019s light, what was I thinking? I don\u2019t know why I wasted my time with you. You\u2019ll not wear my mark another moment!\u201d She swept her arms around in a circle, murmuring words that I certainly couldn\u2019t understand. Then her whole body jerked as if she\u2019d pulled something out of Jerry. I hoped that meant what I thought it did.</p><p>\u201cAre we done then?\u201d Jerry crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cYou\u2019re leaving me? Just like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, we\u2019re done. Do not cross my path again.\u201d She snarled, while spirits came howling out of her fingertips to circle her in a frenzy before finally disappearing like they\u2019d gone down a drain. She faced Rafe and me and, eerily, there was no sign of crazy Melisandra.</p> <p>\u201cMy next seminar is in Dallas, next weekend. I\u2019m sure you signed up for my e-mail list. Perhaps I\u2019ll see you there.\u201d She looked down at the two heaps of ashes. If she had any regrets for her two minions, she didn\u2019t waste time sharing them. Instead, she swept down the alley, her head held high.</p><p>We all stared after her, frozen in place, as if afraid that wasn\u2019t the end of it. But she finally turned the corner and walked out of sight. Then I ran to Jerry.</p><p>\u201cIt worked! You\u2019re free.\u201d I held on to him then smiled at Rafe. \u201cThanks for helping. I didn\u2019t think this would ever be over.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cCan you believe she plugged her business at the end? That woman is a trip.\u201d He leaned against the door. \u201cAnd don\u2019t you have friends in high places. Mars. Wow.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cGlad it worked out.\u201d He disappeared inside.</p><p>\u201cShe is a trip. And I\u2019ll believe she\u2019s gone when I get the e-mail that she\u2019s in Dallas and ready to do her seminar.\u201d I sighed, still afraid to relax.</p><p>Jerry kissed me, taking a good long time with it. \u201cAt least Ian\u2019s potion worked as promised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was worried about it. And what about Mars? Could you hear everything when you were in that weird state Mel put you in?\u201d I couldn\u2019t let go of him.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. Mars/Loa. Whatever you call him, he seems a true warrior. And very fond of you. Did something go on with him I should know about?\u201d Jerry raised an eyebrow.</p> <p>\u201cAre you kidding? You heard him make a date with my mother. Olympus is hinky with lots of inbreeding, but I think I\u2019ll leave him to her.\u201d I shivered in the cold night air. I knew Jerry had to feel the chill in his next-to-nothing outfit. \u201cHey, you promised me a turn with this sex slave thing. You still willing?\u201d I really wasn\u2019t so sure I wanted to go there. I\u2019d hated the way Mel had treated him and he still had the collar around his neck. Part of a chain dangled down his chest.</p><p>\u201cGlory, I\u2019ve always been your sex slave. The clothes or lack of have nothing to do with it.\u201d He kissed my sudden smile. \u201cYou want to head to my place and pull my chain, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>I ran my hands over his back then patted his butt. \u201cOne thing first. Let me see your right thigh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can see more than that at my place.\u201d He kept touching my velvet dress. \u201cDid I tell you how beautiful you looked on that stage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Really. Now hold still. I need to make sure Mel\u2019s mark is gone. Humor me.\u201d I pulled back. \u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Whatever. I don\u2019t remember any silly mark. But she could have done anything during my death sleep. And don\u2019t think that wasn\u2019t hell. Hitting the sheets at sunrise and not knowing what would happen while I slept.\u201d He looked grim.</p><p>\u201cGod, Jerry, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d I dropped to my knees and studied his thigh, going past the scar to the place where the mark had been. Then I spotted it. Oh no. The x was still there. The only thing that had changed was that the heart at the bottom was missing and it was cool, not hot, to the touch. What did it mean? Was he still in danger?</p><p>\u201cSee anything there that interests you?\u201d He was smiling because of where I had my fingertips.</p><p>\u201cOf course. But I\u2019m not taking this further in a dirty alley.\u201d I stood and looked into his eyes. He seemed fine so I wasn\u2019t going to share my concerns. The mark wasn\u2019t in a place where he\u2019d notice it, especially since we couldn\u2019t see our reflection in mirrors.</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s head to my place and my king-size bed. Unless you\u2019re determined to go inside and speak to your adoring fans.\u201d He took my hand.</p><p>\u201cI can live without that. Let\u2019s do it.\u201d I held on tight. \u201cShall we shift?\u201d</p><p>He grinned and we did just that. Love slave. I felt like one too. Jerry\u2019s love slave. If there was more to worry about, I\u2019d let it go till later. Tonight was for celebrating. And that\u2019s what we\u2019d do.</p><p>Nineteen</p><p>The next night Ray asked me to meet him at N-V. I felt I owed him that much, since he\u2019d let me have my moments in the spotlight. Jerry and I arrived about an hour after sunset, too early for much of a crowd. Rafe met us at the door.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re upstairs in the practice room. Go on up.\u201d He nodded toward the bar. \u201cMiguel wants to talk to you too. I\u2019d ignore that one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a minute.\u201d I turned to Jerry. \u201cDo you mind? Miguel helped me last night. Gave me a pep talk when I needed it.\u201d</p><p>Jerry studied the man sipping tequila at the bar. \u201cReally? I can\u2019t imagine what he could say or do that would be helpful. I\u2019ll stay close. I can\u2019t like the guy or his reputation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll just be a minute.\u201d I walked over to the bar. \u201cHey.\u201d I smiled at Miguel. \u201cYou know what you said last night? About my power? It helped me get through things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did you vanquish the evil woman?\u201d He nodded toward Jerry and then downed his drink. \u201cI see your man has left his chains at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mel\u2019s gone and we\u2019re all good.\u201d I sat down on the bar stool next to him and shook my head when he offered to buy me a drink. \u201cNo tequila. I know I can\u2019t handle it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you can\u2019t.\u201d He put down his empty glass. \u201cI have a question for you. Your mother. She is a goddess from Olympus. How did you find this out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe claimed me. One of the other goddesses saw our resemblance and alerted her.\u201d I frowned at him. \u201cI haven\u2019t had time to ask her about you yet. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget. It is important to me.\u201d He picked up his fresh drink and studied it. \u201cI have wondered if I could be . . .\u201d He shook his head. \u201cMayans have many myths and legends.\u201d His grin was startling, the more attractive because I\u2019d so rarely seen his smile. \u201cOkay, so the world didn\u2019t end. But we have many other prophecies that are more correct.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. You told me before that you think maybe you have a god or goddess in your background too, because we share some of the same powers. Is that one of the prophecies you\u2019re talking about? You descended from some Mayan god who\u2019ll raise the tribe to new heights or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mock, Glory. I\u2019m serious. It\u2019s not that simple. And you don\u2019t need to know what I\u2019m talking about. But I saw you go out to the alley with a man dressed as a warrior. A man who sat at your mother\u2019s table full of toga-wearing women. Is he a god?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was Mars.\u201d I studied Miguel\u2019s face. Could there be a slight resemblance? The coloring was different. Miguel definitely had the Indian black hair and eyes. But the shape of the nose and chin . . . It was possible. And Mars had said something to Mother about recognizing someone. How funny if he\u2019d left some offspring in Mayan territory. Maybe that was another place where he was worshipped. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to think I\u2019m crazy.\u201d Miguel looked away, pretending to examine the dance floor.</p><p>\u201cNo, I think you might be on to something. We do have the same superpowers.\u201d I touched his hand. \u201cReading thoughts through blocks, paralyzing people. With time we could probably figure out some more. I remember you can dematerialize too. I just learned that one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d He gripped my hand. \u201cSo you\u2019ll follow up on this for me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNext time I see her, I\u2019ll ask my mother to check on it for you.\u201d I saw Jerry heading our way. \u201cI don\u2019t think my lover is too happy that we\u2019re holding hands, Miguel. Listen, she never comes when I call. It\u2019s a control thing with her. But I\u2019ll be in touch as soon as I find out anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, I\u2019ll owe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know.\u201d I got up and he dropped my hand just as Jerry reached my side.</p><p>\u201cReady to go, Gloriana?\u201d Jerry didn\u2019t acknowledge Miguel.</p><p>\u201cJerry, you know Miguel Cisneros, don\u2019t you?\u201d I wouldn\u2019t let him play that game. \u201cHe and I might be working together so I hope you\u2019ll be civil to each other.\u201d I had noticed Miguel wasn\u2019t bothering to get up or even pretend to care that Jerry had an attitude where he was concerned.</p> <p>\u201cWorking together? On what?\u201d Jerry narrowed his gaze. \u201cI know what you do, Cisneros. Ugly business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoan sharking? Or murder? I\u2019m planning to get out of both occupations. Gloriana and I won\u2019t be involved in either, I can assure you.\u201d He tipped his glass and then finished his drink. \u201cExcuse me. I have an appointment.\u201d He got up, dropped cash on the bar and walked away.</p><p>\u201cTell me that was a joke of some kind.\u201d Jerry frowned at me.</p><p>\u201cNo joke. But let\u2019s go on upstairs. I\u2019ll tell you later.\u201d I pulled him toward the stairs.</p><p>\u201cYou certainly will. The man is bad news.\u201d Jerry dropped my hand. \u201cDon\u2019t drag me, Gloriana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d I looked at his set face. I was pretty sure just being here after last night wasn\u2019t exactly a treat for him. We were silent as we headed up to the practice room.</p> <p>Inside, Ray, Nate and Sienna were sitting at a table with a couple of men I didn\u2019t recognize. Ray jumped up immediately with a smile.</p><p>\u201cHere she is. Glory, this is Steve Jessup, producer from our label. He was very impressed with your performance last night. Sit down and listen to what he has to say.\u201d</p><p>I shook hands with him and was introduced to Steve\u2019s assistant who was taking notes on a tablet computer. \u201cWhat is this, Ray? I told you that was a one-shot deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Ms. St. Clair, or may I call you Glory?\u201d Steve was determined to start the ball rolling.</p><p>\u201cGlory is fine.\u201d I gave Ray a look that meant I\u2019d talk to him later.</p><p>\u201cGlory, Ray here didn\u2019t do a thing. I was here to make sure Sienna was feeling well. And weren\u2019t we thrilled with the work she and Ray did last night.\u201d He and his assistant were beaming and high-fiving all around.</p><p>Sienna\u2019s smile looked strained. She knew now that I hadn\u2019t been bluffing about her career being in jeopardy with her vamp announcement. Seems some publicity was bad publicity. At least at her label.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, then you get up there and just knock my socks off. I mean, look!\u201d He actually pulled up his pants and showed me he didn\u2019t have on socks with his loafers. Oh, big laugh for that one.</p> <p>\u201cThanks, Steve, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, hear me out. I\u2019m telling you this is a fresh sound. I know, I know, the songs have been around for a while. More than a while. But look at what singing standards has done for Rod Stewart. Tony Bennett is still crooning just like he did back in the fifties. There\u2019s a hot market for that retro sound.\u201d He beamed at Sienna. \u201cI know Sienna spotted the potential right away, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Sienna smiled at me and started talking about how we\u2019d come up with the songs and costume. She was in her element, eager to produce a record and eager to smooth things over with the record execs. I really hated to burst her bubble but I\u2019d already made my decision.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d I stood and looked around at the group. \u201cYou are very kind. I\u2019m flattered. But I have a business to run. One that I love. I\u2019m not interested in a singing career. It\u2019s not for me. Aggie, the backup singer, is eager to make a name for herself. Please consider working with her. She\u2019s beautiful and has a wonderful voice.\u201d I started to say more, but bit my tongue. Hey, she could get it or not on her own.</p><p>\u201cNow, don\u2019t be hasty. Did you know you were taped last night by at least three cell phones? You\u2019re up on YouTube already. Over ten thousand hits and climbing hourly. You looked good, sounded good. Ours won\u2019t be the only offer you receive, but remember we were first. And you\u2019d have your friends here to work with.\u201d Steve was serious now. \u201cThink it over. We\u2019ll be in town for a few days. Contract talks with Sienna and Ray. Here\u2019s my card. You can call me anytime.\u201d</p><p>I took it. It would have been rude not to. \u201cThanks, now good night.\u201d I turned and almost ran out of the room, Jerry right behind me. He hadn\u2019t said a word the entire time.</p><p>\u201cThat sounded like a great opportunity.\u201d He caught me at the bottom of the stairs.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want it.\u201d I kept going. \u201cI enjoy my shop. I want to spend more time making it a success. Maybe you can help me draw up a business plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d He stayed next to me as we walked down the street toward the shop. \u201cAnd all this talent you have? The singing? It will just go to waste?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can sing to you, if you like. \u2018Loch Lomond.\u2019 And now I won\u2019t drive you to earplugs. How\u2019s that?\u201d I stopped in front of the shop. I noticed Megan was taking down the Halloween decorations. Good. Time for turkeys and then Christmas. I loved the holidays. We usually did a good business.</p><p>\u201cIt sounds great. I\u2019d much rather you sing a duet with me than with Caine, any night.\u201d Jerry pulled me close for a long kiss.</p><p>\u201cJerry, we\u2019re in public. But I\u2019m not complaining.\u201d I laughed and kissed him this time. \u201cMel\u2019s gone and I got an e-mail tonight confirming that the Dallas seminar is filling up. She also posted a list of even more dates in cities farther north\u2014Kansas City, Chicago, then on to New York. I think we can take it as a sign that she\u2019s moving on from her obsession with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. I sure haven\u2019t heard from her.\u201d He kissed me again.</p><p>\u201cThere you go. I\u2019m as happy as I\u2019ve been in a long time.\u201d I sighed and leaned against him.</p><p>\u201cMe too. There\u2019s just one thing that would make this night better. Perfect.\u201d Jerry pulled away then dropped to one knee and dragged a Tiffany\u2019s blue box out of his pocket. \u201cThis one was in a safe-deposit box.\u201d He snapped it open and the streetlight hit it, dazzling me. \u201cGloriana St. Clair, will you marry me?\u201d</p><p>I blinked, totally shocked that he\u2019d do that here and now. Megan had dropped a fake pumpkin and stared out at us. She must have signaled Lacy because she was suddenly at the window too, pushing aside spiderwebs to gawk at us. People walking down the sidewalk stopped in their tracks. Everyone knew what the down-on-one-knee thing meant. Jerry had done this before. How many times? I\u2019d lost count.</p><p>But this time it was different. I\u2019d finally figured out what I wanted in my life. For my life. Forever.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
