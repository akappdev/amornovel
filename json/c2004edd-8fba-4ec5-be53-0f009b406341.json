Fool me twice...come on, why aren\u2019t you guys saying this with me?\u201d Paige McCarty complains. She cocks her gorgeous blonde head to the side and stares us down with her big, crystal-blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cBecause this is dumb. We do not need to chant our motto every time we get together.\u201d I signal the waitress for another round of drinks.</p><p>I need booze. Lots and lots of booze to get through this meeting. I love my best friends, but sometimes, I want to punch them in the face. Lovingly, of course.</p> <p>\u201cYes, we do, Kennedy O\u2019Brien. We started this company because men are scum-sucking pigs who deserve what\u2019s coming to them,\u201d Paige says with an angry huff as her bright-pink fruity drink is set down in front of her.</p><p>\u201cThank you so much, you\u2019re a doll!\u201d she exclaims to the waitress.</p><p>Not only is Paige insanely beautiful, she can flip her moods faster than anyone I\u2019ve ever seen. At thirty years old, her face has graced the cover of every beauty magazine in existence and she\u2019s got the charm of a Southern belle, but don\u2019t cross her or she will cut you. And this, folks, is why we are friends.</p><p>\u201cI, for one, need to be reminded of why I abhor all things male,\u201d Paige tells us as she blots her lip gloss with a cocktail napkin. \u201cAll of the money I made modeling was blown on Andy\u2019s secret gambling trips. This motto reminds me of how I felt the day I walked into Jimmy Choo and all of my credit cards were declined, and the sense of satisfaction I felt when I went home and set fire to all of Andy\u2019s clothes on the front lawn.\u201d</p><p>A dreamy sigh escapes her heart-shaped mouth when she thinks back on the inferno of revenge, and it reminds me to never get between a model and her need for shoes. Ever. Underneath all that beauty is a brain that is fast thinking, conniving, and perfect for our business.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m certain we will never forget that men are lying, cheating imbeciles.\u201d Lorelei Warner brushes off an imaginary piece of lint on her black suit pants. \u201cGary sent me his wedding invitation yesterday. \u2018We hope you can join us for the joyous celebration of Gary and Doug as they pledge their endless love to each other.\u2019 Can you believe that rat bastard actually invited me?\u201d</p><p>Lorelei, my other best friend, means business when she swears. Sure, \u201crat bastard\u201d isn\u2019t up there on the swearing chart, but it is for her. She\u2019s actually the type of person who will say, \u201cCheese and rice!\u201d instead of Jesus Christ.</p><p>\u201cSee? Lorelei is swearing. The world is coming to an end,\u201d Paige laments to me. \u201cIf we don\u2019t stick together with this motto, she might forget about coming home to find Doug sampling some sweet Italian sausage.\u201d</p><p>Lorelei makes a gagging noise and covers her mouth with her hand. Unfortunately, Paige isn\u2019t talking about food. She\u2019s talking about Nuncio, the hot waiter at Villa Macri Ristorante\u2014the place where Doug proposed to Lorelei and where they celebrated their anniversary every year.</p><p>Lorelei met Doug at Harvard Law and once they both graduated and were well established in their respective law firms, they tied the knot. I always suspected Doug played for the other team. He was too pretty. And do you know any straight men who have hair pomade shipped in from Paris?</p><p>\u201cWhat cases do we have on the schedule this week?\u201d I ask as Lorelei pulls out a few files from her leather briefcase now that she\u2019s composed herself after remembering the night her ex-husband became a gay man.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a bail jumper, a cheating spouse, and a subpoena delivery. Who wants what?\u201d Lorelei asks as she sets the files down in the middle of the table so we can flip through them.</p><p>\u201cI do believe I\u2019ve had enough of cheating spouses, so count me out for that one.\u201d I grab the bail-jumper file and flip through it. I was trained by Uncle Sam in the army, so firing a gun at bad guys and being in the midst of danger is what I thrive on.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of cheating rat bastards, have you talked to Alex lately?\u201d Paige asks as she tests her froufrou drink and finds it to her liking.</p><p>\u201cHa! Yeah, right!\u201d I reply with a snort. Finishing off my Bud Light Lime, I slam the empty glass back onto the table with a clunk. \u201cHe was supposed to pick up the girls last weekend and never showed or called. I hope his penis falls off. I hope it rots and falls off inside of Miss Teen USA, therefore causing her perfect, twenty-two-year-old vagina to rot and fall out of her thong when she sneezes.\u201d</p><p>Paige and Lorelei stare at me with open mouths once I finish with my tirade.</p><p>\u201cWow, tell us how you really feel,\u201d Lorelei replies sympathetically with a pat to my arm.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s fine. I\u2019m perfectly FINE with the fact that while I was fighting for our country, he was fighting to singlehandedly ruin our marriage. What\u2019s NOT fine is the fact that he\u2019s ignoring his daughters. How did I not know he was a worthless human being when I met him?\u201d I ask with a disgusted shake of my head.</p><p>\u201cHow did I not know Andy was playing ten-thousand-dollar hands of Texas Hold\u2019em instead of going to software conferences? How did Lorelei not know that Doug likes to play slap and tickle with balls instead of boobs? Because men are rat bastards, that\u2019s how,\u201d Paige explains.</p> <p>\u201cRat bastards,\u201d Lorelei and I agree with a nod of our heads.</p><p>Continuing my quick scan of the case file, it looks like this should be a pretty easy one to handle. The guy tried to rob a house while the owners were still home. He panicked when he saw them sitting in the kitchen, dropped the laptop he had in his arms, picked up their Chihuahua instead, and bolted out the front door.</p><p>He got out on bail and then skipped his court date. Which is a no-no when you use a bail bondsman to help you get out of jail. You should never piss off a bail bondsman. It will always end badly.</p><p>In this case, Martin McFadden pissed off my father, who owns Buddy\u2019s Bail Bonds, his pride and joy after he retired from the army. All the men in my family served in the army. My grandfather, my Uncle Wally, my two cousins Beaver and Ward (my Aunt Janet loved the TV show Leave It to Beaver\u2014don\u2019t ask), and both of my older brothers, Bobby and Ted. (Bobby, Ted, Kennedy. Go ahead and get it out of your system now. My Irish-American mother always wanted to be Jackie O, sue me.) My mother died when I was a baby and since I was the only girl, army was all I knew. I enlisted right out of high school just like everyone in my family. Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t really do it to make my family happy; I did it to make a boy happy. THE boy. Alex Bradford, my high school sweetheart. I met him in twelfth grade when his father retired from the army and they moved to our small town. We were in gym class together and when I was assigned to his dodgeball team, he leaned down and whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t let anyone hit you with any of the balls.\u201d It melted my heart and pissed me off all at the same time.</p><p>According to the file, the Chihuahua Martin snatched is a two-year-old named Tinkerdoodle that I could punt like a football. He took her from her comfy, pink, bedazzled dog bed, and the owners haven\u2019t stopped crying since then. No, he didn\u2019t go back for the TV, the jewelry, or the artwork; he went back for a yappy, ankle-biting dog. What an idiot. This will be an easy paycheck for the week, I can feel it.</p><p>CHAPTER 2</p><p>Sliding into the front seat of my silver Ford Explorer, I get the SUV started just as my cell phone rings. My dad starts complaining before I even say hello.</p><p>\u201cYour uncle is pissing me off this morning. Pick me up a black-cherry slushie on your way in.\u201d</p><p>While most people need coffee to function properly each day, Buddy O\u2019Brien needs black-cherry slushies from Circle K, the best convenience store in the entire world. I know for a fact that he picks one up every morning on his way to work, so if he\u2019s calling me for a second one, it must be bad.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he do now?\u201d I ask with a sigh as I back out of my driveway and head toward Granger, a suburb of South Bend, Indiana, where both of our offices are located.</p><p>\u201cHe messed up all of my fucking files. I don\u2019t know where a GD thing is in this place. Fucking hell.\u201d</p><p>Word to the wise, my father is a tough guy, but he is Irish Catholic. He will find a way to add the word fuck into every single sentence, but he will never, ever take the Lord\u2019s name in vain. Hell hath no fury like my father if he hears you say Goddamn. When it rains, I can still feel the sting of his hand when he smacked me upside the back of my head the one time I said it when I was twelve and Scooby-Doo didn\u2019t end the way I wanted it to.</p><p>GD Scooby-Doo.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just tell him to stop touching your files,\u201d I suggest as I turn onto Heritage Square Drive and make my way to Circle K.</p><p>\u201cIs that Kennedy? Tell her you\u2019re being unreasonable and that I can\u2019t work under these conditions!\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes at Uncle Wally\u2019s shout in the background and the fact that my father completely forgets that he\u2019s on with me and yells back.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to take this outside, Wallace? I will kick your ass into next week!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you use that tone with me, you old bastard. You couldn\u2019t kick the south side of a barn!\u201d</p><p>Finding a parking spot right in front of the store, I set the phone down in the front passenger seat without hanging up. I grab my father\u2019s super-size black-cherry slushie and a hazelnut coffee with hazelnut cream for myself. Normally, I drink my coffee black. When you\u2019re in the army, you have to get used to the bare essentials. But something tells me I\u2019m going to need a hell of a lot more than just the basics to get through this morning.</p><p>Climbing back into my car, I can still hear my father and uncle shouting through the phone line. My father is two years older than Uncle Wally and I have never seen two people fight more, aside from my brothers. Whatever made them think they should work together is beyond me. When my father retired from the army, he opened Buddy\u2019s Bail Bonds. Two years later, when Uncle Wally retired, he cashed in his pension, invested the money into the business, and became my father\u2019s partner. Once a week, they argue about changing the name to Buddy Wally\u2019s Bail Bonds. You would think that since they share the same last name, one of them might be bright enough to make that suggestion. O\u2019Brien\u2019s Bail Bonds has a nice ring to it. But that would mean the two of them would have to come to a compromise and that\u2019s not happening anytime this century.</p><p>I find a spot on the street in front of Buddy\u2019s and thank the traffic gods that I didn\u2019t have to drive around for twenty minutes looking for a place to park. With my coffee and my dad\u2019s slushie in my hands, I take a fortifying breath before opening the glass door to the office. I immediately have to duck as a stapler comes flying through the air and crashes into the wall.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the dumbass who doesn\u2019t know how to alphabetize!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me a dumbass one more time. Go ahead, do it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDUMBASS!\u201d</p><p>Setting the cups on the nearest desk, I rush in between my father and Uncle Wally as they charge toward each other in the middle of the room.</p><p>\u201cAll right, that\u2019s enough! Back to your corners!\u201d I shout at them, pointing in the general direction of their desks, which are on opposite sides of the room.</p><p>\u201cHe started it,\u201d Uncle Wally complains under his breath as he turns and stomps back to his desk.</p><p>I swear to God it\u2019s like having two more children dealing with these two. A few years ago for Christmas I bought them each a set of boxing gloves. When it gets really bad, I make them go out back and duke it out. This is actually one of the milder arguments and I think we can skip fight club today.</p><p>\u201cI need the rest of the information you have on Martin McFadden,\u201d I tell my dad as I hand him his slushie and he begins gulping it down while he sifts through a pile of files on top of his desk.</p><p>\u201cIf your father would have started using my new filing system, he could have e-mailed you that information in three seconds,\u201d Uncle Wally muses from his desk.</p><p>Dad slams down his cup and starts clenching his fists.</p><p>\u201cCan it, Uncle Wally. Dad, just drink your slushie.\u201d</p><p>With a heavy sigh, he starts slurping through the straw, just to annoy my uncle.</p><p>My dad has a few part-time bounty hunters on his payroll and in the past when he got slammed with requests, before I opened Fool Me Once Investigations and I wasn\u2019t busy with army duty, he\u2019d have me fill in for him. I love the thrill of the chase and the rush of adrenaline when you find your man (or woman) and slap the cuffs on him (or her). After my marriage went down the shitter six months ago, I decided not to reenlist with the army so I could spend more time with my girls and they wouldn\u2019t feel like both parents abandoned them.</p><p>\u201cAhhhh, here we go,\u201d my dad states brightly as he finally finds the McFadden file and hands it over to me. \u201cHis last known address is in there as well as a list of all of his relatives. I haven\u2019t had time to dig any deeper into his criminal background, but I figure Lorelei can pull some strings for you and get whatever else you need. Speaking of Lorelei, how are she and Paige? And when are you going to stop being so stubborn and just come work for me full time instead of just taking a case for me every once in a while?\u201d</p><p>I sigh and shake my head at him. \u201cLorelei and Paige are fine. And we\u2019ve gone over this a thousand times, Dad. I appreciate the offer of a full-time job, but I need to do something on my own. I need to keep busy so I don\u2019t continue filling up notebooks with all of the ways I can remove Alex\u2019s penis from his body. While fun, it\u2019s not very constructive. Or healthy. Fool Me Once is the perfect distraction for me.\u201d</p><p>Grabbing the file from my dad\u2019s hand, I lean over his desk to kiss his cheek.</p><p>\u201cI get it. You need to be independent. Just know, you\u2019ll always have a job here if you decide adding things to the penis-removal list is more worthwhile,\u201d he says with a smile. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I should have known Dad would be on board with that idea. He\u2019s the reason I even started the notebooks in the first place. He\u2019d told me the next time he saw Alex he was going to rip his dick off with his bare hands and then smack Alex across the face with the stump.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Dad. We still on for the Notre Dame game this weekend?\u201d I ask as I grab my coffee and start walking backward to the door.</p><p>\u201cYou bet your sweet ass we are! Kickoff is at noon, so don\u2019t be late,\u201d my dad warns.</p> <p>When you live in South Bend, Indiana, and a stone\u2019s throw away from the University of Notre Dame, football is a way of life. Every Saturday in the fall is dedicated to watching our favorite team and pigging out on beer and junk food.</p><p>\u201cOh, and I hired a new guy for a few of our cases. He\u2019s an ex-cop, so I\u2019m giving him a shot at some bounty-hunter work. He\u2019s going to meet you at McFadden\u2019s house in thirty minutes so you can show him the ropes. Be nice to him,\u201d Dad tells me with a raise of his eyebrow.</p><p>I work alone. I\u2019ve always worked alone. The fact that I own a business with two other women hasn\u2019t changed that. We each bring something different to the table and we each have our own separate jobs to do. Alone.</p><p>My father knows this and I\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t need another bounty hunter, but he hired one anyway to make sure I wouldn\u2019t get into any trouble. For some reason, trouble always seems to find me no matter how hard I try to stay away from it.</p><p>\u201cDad, I don\u2019t need any help on this case. I\u2019m thirty-five years old and I\u2019ve fought in Afghanistan, for fuck\u2019s sake,\u201d I complain as I shake my head at him.</p> <p>\u201cHumor me, Kennedy. I\u2019m old. I\u2019m going to die soon. I\u2019d like to die knowing you\u2019ll be safe.\u201d</p><p>My dad has many skills. But his best one is his guilt trips. He is as healthy as a horse and the most stubborn human being on the face of the earth. He isn\u2019t going to die anytime soon. He\u2019ll outlive cockroaches and Twinkies.</p><p>I throw my hand in the air in an irritated wave and head back outside to my car. I swear to God if this guy doesn\u2019t stay out of my way or screws anything up on this job, I will take my dad out back and beat his ass myself.</p><p>GD newbie bounty hunters.</p><p>CHAPTER 3</p><p>I pull up to the address for Martin McFadden and even though I googled the area and I\u2019m a little familiar with the neighborhood, I\u2019m still a bit surprised that this is the house of the criminal I\u2019m hunting. It\u2019s not the typical residence of a person I\u2019m tracking down. Those people lean more toward houses on wheels with Spider-Man bedsheets for curtains and one-room apartments that make crack houses look like the lap of luxury.</p> <p>This house looks like a sweet, little old lady lives here, not a bail-jumping criminal. It\u2019s a ranch with a gorgeous white wraparound porch and there are hanging baskets of flowers all along the railing. As I get out of my vehicle, I notice the lawn has been manicured right down to those crisscross patterns you see on baseball fields. I make my way up the front walk and when I see a decorative flag stuck in the ground by the porch steps that says \u201cWelcome Friends!\u201d I\u2019m once again bolstered by the fact that bringing this guy in will be a piece of cake.</p><p>According to the file, he\u2019s fifty years old, has never been married, and is kind of a hermit. I get to the top step and the loud rumble of a motorcycle has me whipping my head around and my hand automatically going for my gun. I didn\u2019t see anything in the notes about McFadden owning a motorcycle, but you can never be too sure about these things.</p><p>I watch as a Heritage Softail Classic Harley pulls to a stop right in front of the house and feel my insides quiver. Even though this guy is wearing a helmet and I haven\u2019t seen his face yet, I can already tell this isn\u2019t my guy. McFadden is five foot five and a hundred twenty-five pounds soaking wet; this guy is wearing a tight, white T-shirt and the muscles in his biceps tighten as he clutches the handlebars and swings his leg over the seat of the bike.</p><p>With his back to me while he pockets the bike key, I have time to appreciate him. And by appreciate, I mean ogle. I\u2019m staring at his ass and I\u2019m not ashamed to admit it. Whoever this guy is, he has an amazing ass. I watch as he reaches up and slides his helmet off and I take note of the way his shirt stretches across the muscles of his back.</p><p>I need to get laid. I really, really need to get laid. I\u2019m standing on the front porch of a bail jumper\u2019s house panting like a dog.</p><p>This must be the guy my father hired. I can see his service pistol secured in the waistband of his jeans at his back. It\u2019s a Beretta M9\u2014the exact same gun I use. Maybe my father had the right idea hiring this guy. I don\u2019t need the help, but at least he\u2019ll be pretty to look at. And maybe if he\u2019s lucky, I\u2019ll throw him a bone. Or he can throw me his bone. My girly bits tingle just thinking about being anywhere near this guy and his bone.</p><p>\u201cCome on, pretty boy. Turn around so I can see your face,\u201d I whisper to myself as he secures his helmet to the back of the bike and finally turns to face me.</p><p>All thoughts of bones, humping, and great asses fly out the window and my mouth drops open in complete and utter shock.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t happening. This is SO not happening right now.</p><p>The corner of his mouth tips up in a panty-dropping grin, showcasing the dimple on his left cheek, and I want to stomp my feet and throw a temper tantrum right now because he knows I was staring at his ass. He knows I was standing here on this porch thinking about all of the dirty things I could do to him. He knows it and he\u2019s enjoying every minute of it, the rat bastard.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d I shout angrily as I stomp down the steps and meet him in the middle of the sidewalk.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you too, gorgeous. It\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p><p>Griffin Crawford. My ex-husband\u2019s best friend and the guy I once had a massive crush on in high school. Even though I never did anything stupid like act on my attraction to him back in the day, he still knew. Somehow, he knew and he used it to piss me off on a regular basis. Griffin went to high school with me and Alex and he also followed us into the army. On my last tour in Afghanistan, it was Griffin whom I spent months with in the desert, fighting for our lives. It was Griffin whom I confided in that I thought something was off with Alex back home. It was Griffin who convinced me that Alex and I were just going through a rough patch, and that once I got back home, everything would be fine, and we\u2019d work things out.</p><p>A few months after I kicked Alex\u2019s sorry, cheating ass out of the house, I found out Griffin knew about the affair the entire time.</p><p>He knew and he had let me cry on his shoulder wondering what the hell was wrong. He let me pour my heart out to him day after day and he never said a word. Childish teasing aside, through the years, Griffin became one of my best friends too. You would think that would guarantee me a little bit of loyalty. But obviously, since I don\u2019t have a penis, I wasn\u2019t cool enough for the truth.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me gorgeous and don\u2019t waltz in here like it\u2019s no big deal,\u201d I growl at him. \u201cI don\u2019t know what angle you\u2019re playing at by getting my father to hire you, but you can just get your ass back on that bike. I am NOT working with you.\u201d</p><p>Griffin takes a step closer to me and pushes his hands into the front pockets of his jeans.</p><p>\u201cAre you referring to the ass you were staring at when I pulled up? I just want to make sure I\u2019m understanding you correctly,\u201d he says with that stupid, cocky grin.</p><p>\u201cOh, get over yourself! I have a job to do and I don\u2019t need you fucking everything up. I prefer to work with honest, loyal people. Not backstabbing, lying assholes,\u201d I fire at him.</p><p>I\u2019m actually shocked to see the cockiness wiped right off his face, replaced by a look of regret and anger as he stares down at me.</p><p>\u201cI never lied to you, Kennedy. I was in the dark about Alex just as much as you were. If you stopped avoiding me and ignoring all my calls and texts at any point over the last few months, I could have explained it to you,\u201d he tells me, moving even closer until I have to crane my neck to see his face.</p><p>I\u2019m pretty tall, but Griffin towers over me at six foot four. Alex and I are the exact same height. Maybe that\u2019s why I always felt more safe and protected when I was in combat with Griffin. Or when I was anywhere in the same vicinity as him. Griffin always has a five-o\u2019clock shadow and I\u2019ve never seen him in anything other than a T-shirt, jeans, and shit-kicker boots. Where pretty boy Alex is a lover (of anything with a vagina), Griffin is a fighter and intimidates everyone he comes in contact with. Except for me.</p><p>If he didn\u2019t have such a big attitude and so many muscles, I\u2019d say he could pass for a surfer boy with his blue eyes and dark blond hair that he usually keeps military short, but it had grown out a bit on top since the last time I\u2019d seen him.</p><p>\u201cYou tried to feed me that same bullshit six months ago, remember? I didn\u2019t believe it then and I sure as hell don\u2019t believe it now. Are you forgetting about the fact that I heard you? I heard you talking to him. I listened to you tell him not to say anything to me.\u201d</p><p>I can feel myself starting to get choked up as I remember the day I walked into Griffin\u2019s house a few hours after I\u2019d seen Alex with the nanny. Alex had no idea I\u2019d seen him. I was too stunned to do anything other than run back out of the house and drive around aimlessly. When I came back to my senses, I immediately went to Griffin\u2019s house to get his advice. I walked into Griffin\u2019s kitchen that day and overheard him talking to Alex on the phone. I stood there while Griffin advised my husband to continue to lie to me about the affair and never, ever tell me the truth. I thought my heart was broken when I found out Alex had been screwing around on me, but it was nothing compared to having one of your best friends deceive you.</p><p>\u201cKennedy, that\u2019s not how\u2014\u201d</p><p>I cut him off and cross my arms angrily in front of me. \u201cOh, shut the hell up! I don\u2019t want to listen to your excuses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t want to listen to reason either. You shut me out for six months, but enough is enough. We are going to hash this out once and for all. I\u2019m not going anywhere this time, Kennedy.\u201d</p><p>Turning my back on him so I don\u2019t have to see his face, I walk away and head back toward the front porch so I can case the house and see if McFadden has been back here since he skipped out on his court date.</p><p>\u201cGo away, Griffin. I don\u2019t need your help on this job and I sure as hell don\u2019t need you in my life,\u201d I shout over my shoulder.</p><p>No sooner have the words left my mouth than gunshots ring out from somewhere in the house. I don\u2019t even have time to reach for my gun before I\u2019m tackled from behind and pushed down into the grass. Griffin\u2019s body completely covers mine and his arms shield my head as shots echo above us for a few more seconds. When silence finally descends on the neighborhood, I feel Griffin slowly push himself up off me just enough so I can roll over underneath him.</p><p>This was a bad decision. A really bad decision considering how pissed I am at him and how sex deprived I am right now. Our bodies are touching from feet to chest and I can feel every inch of his hard, muscled body on top of mine. It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve had a man\u2019s body pressing into me and I am not happy with how good it feels right now.</p><p>Griffin is hot. I\u2019ve always thought he was hot, but he was my friend. Friend only, because even though I may have had a silly crush on him at one point, I was already dating Alex and obviously I had better morals than Alex did. And now, Griffin is no longer my friend because he lied to me.</p><p>Someone needs to get that message to my vagina because she isn\u2019t having any of this \u201cI\u2019m pissed off at Griffin and want nothing to do with him\u201d nonsense. Her engine is running and she\u2019s screaming at me to shift into high gear.</p><p>I swallow thickly and look up into Griffin\u2019s face. He\u2019s scanning the yard and the house to find the threat and I can\u2019t help but stare at his throat and chiseled jaw and wonder what his skin tastes like.</p><p>Jesus, what the hell is wrong with me? Am I that desperate that I would lie here in the grass after being shot at and fantasize about my ex\u2014best friend? Thirty seconds with this man and I\u2019ve already lost my freaking mind.</p><p>The sounds of a crash and squealing tires pull my attention away from the man above me and I crane my neck to see a red Honda Civic crashing through the closed garage door of McFadden\u2019s house. The man behind the wheel, whom I assume is McFadden because of the tiny little Chihuahua sitting on his lap, screams at us as he floors it backward out of the driveway and into the street.</p><p>\u201cYOU\u2019LL NEVER TAKE ME ALIVE!\u201d</p><p>His threat is punctuated by a short, yippy bark from Tinkerdoodle before he throws the car out of reverse and takes off down the residential street.</p><p>\u201cSo, what was that you were saying about not needing help on this job?\u201d Griffin asks, the cocky grin back on his face as he stares down at me and makes no move to get the hell off me.</p><p>Placing my palms flat on his muscled chest, I shove him roughly away until he rolls to the side. I scramble up from the ground, wiping grass and dirt off my jeans and out of my hair before stalking across the yard toward my car.</p><p>\u201cSo, I guess I\u2019ll talk to you later and we can go over our strategy?\u201d he yells with a chuckle as I get in my car and angrily slam the door closed without answering him.</p><p>I am never going to be able to get any work done with him around, trying to worm his way back into my life.</p><p>GD Griffin Crawford.</p><p>CHAPTER 4</p><p>I walk through the door of Fool Me Once Investigations and avoid my friends\u2019 stares at the condition I\u2019ve returned to the office in as I sit down at my desk. I realize my hair is filled with grass and my clothes are dirty and askew, but I was kind of hoping they wouldn\u2019t notice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBoy, I could use some more coffee. Did anyone make a pot?\u201d I ask as I drum my fingers on top of my desk, waiting for my Mac to come to life.</p><p>Neither of them answer me and I can see them looking at me out of the corner of my eye. Just act natural. Nothing to see here, folks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in the mood to go shopping. Maybe buy some new shoes!\u201d I exclaim.</p> <p>Shit! I hate shopping. What the hell am I saying?</p><p>\u201cHa ha, just kidding! Shopping is dumb. We should sign up for a cooking class. Wouldn\u2019t that be great?!\u201d</p><p>What? NO! STOP TALKING!</p><p>\u201cSo no one made any coffee? I think I\u2019ll make a pot. Who wants a cup?\u201d I ask in a rush as I get up from my desk and make a beeline for the kitchenette in the back of the office.</p><p>Paige intercepts me halfway, her eyes narrowing as she looks me over from head to toe.</p> <p>\u201cOh my God! Why do you have leaves in your hair? Sweet Jesus. Lorelei, get Sven on the phone, I can see Kennedy\u2019s roots.\u201d</p><p>Son of a bitch.</p><p>I don\u2019t have time to sit in a chair for four hours and listen to Sven tell me about his Yorkshire terrier, Mrs. Justin Bieber, and her bowel movements. That dog is as dumb as her namesake. She walks in circles until she gets so dizzy that she falls down. Like those fainting goats on YouTube. Her legs go all stiff and then she just falls to her side and Sven leaves me in my chair with enough foils on my head to communicate with Mars to go running up to her in a screaming panic telling people to call 911. Then the dumbass dog immediately jumps up and starts the process all over again. Mrs. Justin Bieber is an asshole.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I have to be in court in twenty minutes,\u201d Lorelei states, getting up from her own desk and walking toward me. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>I do my own shrugging in response and continue with the act that this is just a regular day at the office. A regular day of being shot at and snuggling in the grass with a guy who makes my blood boil.</p><p>\u201cHey, I need you to pull up whatever information you can find on McFadden. My dad didn\u2019t have time to get everything.\u201d Time to change the subject.</p> <p>\u201cI figured as much. Here you go,\u201d she tells me, handing me a file filled with papers. \u201cNow, back to the issue at hand. Or should I say, tree bark in hair. What happened?\u201d</p><p>Taking the file from her hand, I make a production of flipping through the pages, oohing and ahhing at what I see as she stands there tapping her high-heeled foot on the floor.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Lo. Speaking of the bail jumper, how about we switch cases? I think it\u2019s about time you got your feet wet out in the field,\u201d I tell her as Paige begins pulling leaves and grass out of my hair, mumbling to herself about wasted beauty.</p><p>Lorelei snorts, shaking her head. \u201cNice try. I\u2019m pretty sure we have a rule somewhere in our mission statement about how each individual assigned to a case will see the entire thing through, right, Paige?\u201d</p><p>Paige nods her head absently as she gives me a reassuring pat on the back before noticing another grass stain by my hip.</p><p>\u201cThou shalt not covet thy friend\u2019s cases. Why do you want to trade?\u201d</p><p>I smack Paige\u2019s hands away from my hip and shoot her a dirty look.</p><p>\u201cReally? The Ten Commandments are in our mission statement?\u201d I ask irritably.</p> <p>\u201cWhy are you changing the subject?\u201d Lorelei demands.</p><p>Because I cannot work with Griffin.</p><p>\u201cBecause this is going to be a pretty boring, easy case. Perfect for one of you to handle to get some experience behind you,\u201d I lie.</p><p>\u201cA boring, easy case doesn\u2019t usually involve coming back to the office looking like roadkill,\u201d Paige says.</p><p>\u201cGee, thank you so much,\u201d I tell her sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cFresh roadkill, but roadkill nonetheless,\u201d she replies with a shrug. \u201cSpill it.\u201d</p><p>I can question insurgents in the middle of war-torn Afghanistan, but I am no match for these two. It only takes a few seconds of their stare-down before I cave.</p><p>\u201cI WAS SHOT AT! I saw my life flash before me!\u201d</p><p>Lorelei rolls her eyes at me. \u201cYou love being shot at\u2014it gives you a cheap thrill. Try again.\u201d</p><p>GD friends.</p><p>\u201cFINE! Griffin Crawford showed up at McFadden\u2019s house. On a HARLEY. And dove on top of me to protect me when McFadden started shooting. And my father hired him to work on this case. Can you believe that? My own father is a traitor.\u201d</p><p>Paige lets out a low whistle under her breath. \u201cA Harley? Oh, man. You\u2019re screwed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe speaks the truth,\u201d Lorelei adds as she grabs her leather briefcase and Coach purse and moves toward the door. \u201cYou\u2019ve watched every season of Sons of Anarchy thirty-seven times and instead of porn hidden under your mattress, you have American Iron and Harley-Davidson\u2019s HOG magazines. You\u2019re definitely screwed.\u201d</p><p>Lorelei blows us a kiss as she exits the office to get to court and I turn to face Paige with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cSo, what kind of bike does he have?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, it\u2019s a Heritage Softail Classic with a Twin Cam engine, laced wheels with whitewalls, and studded leather. It\u2019s beautiful,\u201d I tell her as I close my eyes and picture the bike in my head. The bike with me on the back of it, my body draped around Griffin, and my arms clutching his waist.</p><p>Shit!</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell am I supposed to do? I can\u2019t work with Griffin,\u201d I complain.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. You\u2019re absolutely right. There is no way you can work with that man under these conditions. It\u2019s a tragedy and I am going to do something about it.\u201d Paige grabs her cell phone from her desk and starts scrolling through her contacts.</p><p>What would I do without my friends? Seriously? I knew Paige wouldn\u2019t let me down. I know my father gave me this case and transferring it to another firm is going to piss him off, but he\u2019ll just have to deal with it. Paige understands what a bad idea it would be for me to be anywhere near Griffin, Harley or no Harley. I don\u2019t trust him. I can\u2019t work with someone I don\u2019t trust. Especially when he\u2019s a cocky smartass with too many muscles. And a Harley. A fucking Harley.</p><p>\u201cHello, darling, it\u2019s Paige,\u201d she says into her phone. \u201cI need your help. It\u2019s an emergency.\u201d</p><p>I can always count on my friends. This makes me feel warm and fuzzy to know she\u2019s got my back.</p><p>\u201cNo, not for me, for Kennedy,\u201d she continues, before turning to face me and staring me up and down before shaking her head sadly at me.</p><p>What the hell is she doing? She doesn\u2019t need to look at me like that just to call another PI firm a few towns over for some additional help.</p><p>\u201cYes, I think it has to be today. She can\u2019t go on like this anymore,\u201d Paige adds. \u201cPerfect! You are a lifesaver. Kiss, kiss. We\u2019ll see you in twenty.\u201d</p><p>Paige hangs up the phone and walks around her desk to retrieve her purse from one of the drawers.</p><p>\u201cWhy do we need to go see the guys at Osborne Investigations? Can\u2019t they just send someone over so I can fill them in on the case?\u201d</p><p>Paige pulls her keys out of her purse and walks back over to me, linking her arm through mine and pulling me toward the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? I didn\u2019t call Osborne. I called Sven. Your roots are atrocious. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m letting you anywhere near Griffin Crawford again with hair like that.\u201d</p><p>She clutches my arm with both hands when she feels me start to resist, I don\u2019t even bother hiding my contempt by calling her every bad name I can think of from A to Z, starting with asshat and ending with...</p><p>GD zoo animal cray-cray.</p><p>CHAPTER 5</p><p>Get away from me, you little rat,\u201d I whisper to Mrs. Justin Bieber as she sniffs the toe of my boot and then walks away in an angry huff.</p><p>I glare at Paige as she happily chats up Sven a few feet away, hoping she\u2019ll feel my stare of death and get me the hell out of here. I don\u2019t have time for this. I have a bail jumper to catch and a Harley man to get rid of.</p><p>I reach my fingers up to the neckband of the black plastic cape and tug on it, trying to relieve some of the choking sensation. My head itches like crazy so I use one of my fingernails to dig in between the foils.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch anysing. Vhat is vrong viff you. You mess up my masterpiece,\u201d Sven scolds as he walks over to me, smacks my hand away, and lifts up some of the foils on my head to check them.</p><p>I know for a fact Sven\u2019s name is really Steve and he was born and raised in Jersey. Every time he speaks I want to borrow a page out of my dad\u2019s handbook, smack him upside the head, and ask him what the hell is wrong with him.</p><p>\u201cCan you please remoof da gun? It making me so nervous. You shoot Sven on accident,\u201d he tells me with a nervous shiver as he stares down at my gun in its holster at my hip.</p><p>\u201cHow much longer is this going to take? I have work to do,\u201d I complain as I unclip my gun and holster and set it on the tray of unused foils next to me.</p><p>\u201cBeauty takes time, Kennedy. Be a good girl and maybe I\u2019ll take you out for ice cream when we\u2019re finished,\u201d Paige says with a smile.</p><p>Is it illegal for me to pull my gun in the middle of a salon? I need to check the rules of my CCW permit.</p><p>\u201cHere, why don\u2019t you read through McFadden\u2019s file while you\u2019re sitting there so patient and well behaved.\u201d Paige picks up the folder on the floor by my feet and drops it into my lap.</p><p>While Sven walks over to the front desk and Paige flips through a magazine next to me, I watch as Mrs. Justin Bieber whizzes on the floor in the middle of the room. Rolling my eyes, I suck it up and try to get some work done while I\u2019m slowly tortured to death with foil and hair color.</p><p>Flipping through the pages of the life and times of Martin McFadden, I almost can\u2019t believe what I\u2019m seeing. This guy is nuts. According to what Lorelei found in his court records, he\u2019s been to jail twenty-two times for making erroneous phone calls to the police. Phone calls about tiny little green men from Mars that were trying to break into his house and eat his brain. Two years ago he was arrested outside of a costume shop at Halloween, screaming at anyone who would listen that if they bought alien costumes, it would anger the little men and they would kill us all. Six months ago he petitioned for a patent for his \u201cAlien Safety Helmet,\u201d a pile of tinfoil that he believes should be mandatory for all citizens to wear to protect them from their thoughts being stolen in the middle of the night. He even wrote a book called They\u2019re Reading Our Minds, Watching Us Sleep.</p><p>Sweet Jesus. This is the guy I have to track down?</p><p>As I continue reading, I hear the bell as the door opens and someone asks if they handle dog grooming. As I continue to read and try to ignore the conversation going on by the reception desk, I hear a word that makes me whip my head up and my eyes bug out of my head: Tinkerdoodle.</p><p>My eyes meet McFadden\u2019s across the room as he cradles a trembling brown Chihuahua in his arms. I didn\u2019t get a very good look at him when he sped off in his Honda, but I have one of his mug shots and it\u2019s definitely my guy. If he hadn\u2019t already shot at me, I\u2019d say he looks harmless. Almost like a professor of literature with his dark brown corduroy pants, blue button-down shirt, and light brown, cable-knit sweater, his brown hair graying at the temples.</p><p>Even with all the foil on top of my head and the cape draped around me, he recognizes me immediately and lets out an ear-piercing shriek before turning and running for the door.</p><p>\u201cSON OF A BITCH!\u201d I shout as I scramble to get out of the chair. My feet immediately get caught in the yards of plastic cape and I land in a cursing heap on the floor.</p><p>\u201cPAIGE, STOP HIM!\u201d I shout to my friend as she immediately bursts into action and easily leaps over Mrs. Justin Bieber in her four-inch Manolo Blahniks and runs toward the door. McFadden shoves Sven out of the way and into a shelf of hair products and everything comes crashing to the ground, Sven included.</p><p>Even though he\u2019s lying in a pile of shampoo and conditioner, Sven reaches out with one arm and grabs McFadden\u2019s pant leg to try and keep him in place while Paige makes her way closer by kicking hair products out of her way with her heels.</p><p>Pushing myself up off the floor, I race across the room as McFadden continues to go for the door, dragging Sven across the floor on his belly behind him while Mrs. Justin Bieber begins yapping and racing around in circles. I watch Paige easily jumping through the maze of fallen bottles and almost grab him when her heel punctures a shampoo bottle and she stops to try and kick it loose. With Paige distracted, McFadden sees me coming for him and starts grabbing anything he can find and pitching it at us one-handed as he heads for the door. Aerosol tins of hairspray fly past my head and Paige takes a gallon jug of conditioner to the shoulder before Sven finally loses his hold on McFadden\u2019s pant leg.</p><p>\u201cMAN DOWN! MAN DOWN!\u201d Sven screams hysterically as Paige and I jump over his body and fly out of the door right behind McFadden, poor Tinkerdoodle shaking in fear in his arms as he runs.</p><p>When we get out onto the sidewalk, I quickly scan every direction until I spot him sprinting full speed to his Honda parked along the curb a block away. I take off at a dead run, my black cape flying behind me like I\u2019m a superhero and I hear Paige\u2019s heels smacking against the cement as she races behind me.</p><p>\u201cSTOP! MCFADDEN!\u201d I scream as I race down the sidewalk and watch him jump into his vehicle and start it up.</p><p>He peels out of his parking spot and does a U-turn in the middle of the street, pulling his car right up to Paige and me as we stand there trying to catch our breath.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wearing my Alien Safety Helmet!\u201d he exclaims through his open window as he stares in awe at the foil on my head. \u201cYou believe! I feel like under different circumstances, we could really be friends.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Stepping down off the curb, I reach for my gun in its side holster, but quickly realize Sven made me take the fucking thing off.</p><p>\u201cSHIT!\u201d I yell in frustration as my hands get tangled in the plastic. \u201cMcFadden, don\u2019t you dare move. Get out of the car right now. You skipped bail and stole someone\u2019s dog.\u201d</p><p>Tinkerdoodle lets out a high-pitched yap and McFadden cradles the dog to his chest.</p> <p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t appreciate her! She\u2019s my best friend. YOU\u2019LL NEVER TAKE HER AWAY FROM ME!\u201d he screams before gunning the car and taking off down the street.</p><p>He\u2019s too far away at this point for me to take a shot at one of his tires to slow him down even if I did have my gun on me. And as I glance around and see all of the people out on the sidewalk watching what just happened, I assume they wouldn\u2019t have appreciated me firing my gun at a car in the middle of the day anyway.</p><p>I can hear sirens in the distance. Sven must have called the police. I can\u2019t believe that idiot was right there in front of us and we didn\u2019t get him. This is appalling. Thankfully, my brother Ted and my cousin Ward both work for the local police department so the odds are pretty good that one of them will show up. And if I threaten their lives, they\u2019ll keep this whole thing a secret. No one needs to know that I had my bail jumper within arm\u2019s reach and couldn\u2019t get him because I was getting my hair highlighted. I would never live that shit down.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe that asshole got away,\u201d Paige complains with her hands on her hips as she stares off down the street.</p><p>Turning toward her, I look down at her shoes in awe. \u201cHow in the hell did you run so fast in those things?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat was nothing. Try being at a Gucci sample sale. Those bitches will cut you if you\u2019re not fast,\u201d she says with a shrug.</p><p>As we turn to make my way back to the salon, the rumbling sound of a Twin Cam Harley engine makes me freeze in place. I slowly turn around.</p><p>GD McFadden.</p><p>CHAPTER 6</p><p>You really shouldn\u2019t have prettied yourself up just for me,\u201d Griffin says with a laugh as he saunters over to me.</p><p>Catching my reflection in the storefront window next to me, I realize I still have foils in my hair and they are sticking up in every direction. Not to mention the splendid cape that\u2019s draped around my body making it look like I\u2019m a member of McFadden\u2019s Anti-Martian army.</p> <p>Wonderful. Just wonderful.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d I mutter through clenched teeth as I stand up as straight as I can and pretend like the fact that I\u2019m out on the sidewalk looking like an ass in front of this man doesn\u2019t bother me in the least.</p><p>\u201cI heard the news on my police scanner. Figured I\u2019d stop by and commend you on catching our criminal. But I\u2019m assuming by the pissed-off look on your face that he got away,\u201d he mocks.</p><p>\u201cMcFadden is not our criminal. He\u2019s my criminal. I already told you I don\u2019t need your help. He caught me by surprise, that\u2019s all. I wasn\u2019t expecting him to show up at a salon in broad daylight.\u201d</p><p>If he doesn\u2019t stop smirking at me, I\u2019m going to rip this stupid cape off, wrap it around his neck, and choke the life out of him.</p><p>\u201cSince when do you go to salons? I thought you wouldn\u2019t be caught dead in one of these places,\u201d he questions. I can see him pressing down hard on his lips, his eyes glancing to my hair and then quickly back to my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t go to these places. I have friends who go to these places and drag me here against my will. And it\u2019s just highlights, nothing drastically life changing. Golden blonde highlights that will bring out the gold specks in my eyes.\u201d</p><p>Overshare much, Kennedy?</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need highlights for that. Your eyes are gorgeous enough all on their own,\u201d he says softly as he looks into said gorgeous eyes.</p><p>Holy hell, is it hot out here or is it just me? And what the devil is he playing at, flirting with me like this? Yes, I said flirting and I realize how outrageous that sounds. Griffin Crawford is fucking flirting with me. I\u2019ve known him long enough to know when he\u2019s turning on the charm. I\u2019ve seen him charm the underwear right off a stranger in two point three seconds just by complimenting her legs. My underwear is staying right where it is, thank you very much.</p><p>Before I can tell him exactly what I think about him and his stupid gorgeous-eyes compliment, a police cruiser pulls up to the curb next to us. I thank my lucky stars when I see my cousin Ward get out and come around to stand next to us.</p><p>\u201cNice hairstyle, Kennedy. Trying to make a phone call to your motherland?\u201d Ward asks with a laugh as he reaches up and flicks one of the foils on my head.</p><p>Never mind. I take back my thankfulness.</p><p>\u201cKiss my ass, Ward. I\u2019ve had a bad fucking day.\u201d</p><p>I know what you\u2019re saying to yourself right now: this sounds like June Cleaver finally had enough of Beaver and the gang\u2019s shit.</p><p>Ward can see by the look on my face that he should leave me alone. I won\u2019t hesitate to put him in a headlock in the middle of the sidewalk. I don\u2019t care if he is wearing his police uniform.</p><p>\u201cGriffin, my man! How\u2019ve you been?\u201d Ward asks, turning his attention away from me.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t complain,\u201d Griffin replies as the two men exchange handshakes and start talking back and forth about Notre Dame\u2019s upcoming season. As teenagers and into early adulthood, we all hung out together: my brothers, my cousins, Griffin, Alex, and me. We were all close in age and we all had the army in common so it naturally made us friends.</p><p>The fact that my brothers and my cousins are still friendly with Griffin when he screwed me over pisses me off. They should hate him on principle. If some woman came into my family\u2019s lives and stomped all over their hearts, I would cut that bitch. Where\u2019s the damn loyalty?</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, I hate to interrupt this bromance, but we have work to do.\u201d I glare at my cousin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, it is impossible to take you seriously right now with all that shit on your head,\u201d Ward says, laughing.</p><p>I take a step in his direction, preparing myself for a mind-erasing headlock when Griffin lightly touches my arm.</p><p>\u201cBefore you kill him, we need to talk,\u201d Griffin tells me.</p><p>\u201cWe have nothing to talk about. I\u2019m going to go inside and get this crap out of my hair and then I\u2019m going to get to work. You can just get your ass back on that bike and go find someone else to annoy,\u201d I tell him as I turn and fling the door to the salon open angrily.</p><p>As soon as I walk inside I\u2019m met by the sounds of wails and barking. Sven is still sitting on the floor in a pile of hair products while Paige attempts to console him, and Mrs. Justin Bieber is losing her shit, barking at anything in her general vicinity and stopping every ten seconds to piss on the floor.</p><p>\u201cI ALMOST DIED, PAIGE! It was HORRIBLE! I have so many regrets. So many things I\u2019ve never accomplished. I\u2019M TOO YOUNG TO DIE!\u201d</p><p>I wonder if anyone else notices that in the midst of Sven\u2019s hysterics he seems to have forgotten he has an accent. Paige is crouched down next to Sven and pats him on the back at the appropriate times. She catches my gaze and rolls her eyes in annoyance.</p><p>\u201cThere, there, Sven. You\u2019re okay. Look, Kennedy is back!\u201d she exclaims, getting up from her spot on the floor and rushing over to me, lowering her voice so only I can hear her. \u201cI\u2019m going to punch him in his face if he doesn\u2019t stop whining.\u201d</p><p>Taking a deep breath, I move away from Paige and over to Sven\u2019s spot on the floor.</p><p>\u201cSven, you did really good under pressure. You almost had that guy!\u201d I tell him so he\u2019ll quit the damn crying.</p><p>Sven sniffles and wipes his nose on the sleeve of his shirt.</p><p>\u201cI did do vell, didn\u2019t I? I always sought I should haff been a cop. I haff all of dees natural eenstincts,\u201d he tells me seriously, in full-on Germedishithuanian, or wherever-the-hell-he-thinks-he\u2019s-from accent.</p><p>It takes everything in me not to laugh in his face, but I have to rein it in. I need this guy to fix my hair, pronto.</p><p>\u201cYes, you\u2019re absolutely right. How about you get up off the floor and take these foils out of my hair while my cousin Ward questions you?\u201d I ask as Ward walks through the door.</p><p>\u201cOooooh, a man in uniform! I veel better already,\u201d Sven exclaims as he takes in my cousin from head to toe before jumping up off the floor and extending his hand out to him, wrist cocked, like he wants Ward to kiss the top of his hand. \u201cMy name eez Sven. I am zee one who almost captured zee criminal.\u201d</p><p>Paige and I share a look of annoyance before turning back to watch Ward awkwardly grab Sven\u2019s hand and shake it like a limp noodle.</p><p>While Sven begins to regale my cousin with his act of heroism, the bell chimes above the door and I turn to see Griffin walk in.</p><p>\u201cOut! Get out!\u201d I raise my hand and point to the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere until you talk to me,\u201d Griffin replies firmly.</p><p>I don\u2019t even acknowledge his words. I turn my back on him and drag Sven back toward the shampoo bowls as Ward follows us and continues to ask Sven questions about whether or not he\u2019d ever seen McFadden in the shop before and if McFadden mentioned anything about where he was staying.</p><p>Getting comfortable in the reclining seat with my head in the bowl, I close my eyes and try to relax as Sven begins removing foils while talking to Ward. I\u2019m assuming Griffin finally got the hint, but a few seconds later when Sven is running warm water through my hair and massaging my head, I realize Griffin wouldn\u2019t get the hint if it ran him over with a Mack truck.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t avoid me forever,\u201d Griffin whispers close to my ear.</p><p>Too close. I can feel his breath against my neck and it makes me grit my teeth when I feel goose bumps on my arms. Can\u2019t he see I\u2019m trying to relax here? He needs to leave me the hell alone. I may not be able to avoid him forever, like he says, but I sure as hell can refuse to talk to him until he goes away.</p><p>\u201cFine, if you don\u2019t want to talk now, we can do it later,\u201d he states before standing up to his full height and then turning to leave.</p><p>As Sven finishes washing my hair and wraps a towel around my head, I avoid smirking to myself as I see Griffin walk away.</p><p>The power of my ignoring skills cannot be beat. We all know that when a man says he\u2019ll do something \u201clater,\u201d it will never, ever be completed. I actually find myself smiling as I walk over to Sven\u2019s station so he can spray and brush and flat-iron and all that other shit that usually makes me cringe. Right now, Sven can do whatever he wants to me. Griffin has gotten the hint and is finally walking away.</p><p>I don\u2019t realize I\u2019m staring at Griffin\u2019s ass as he walks away until I\u2019m not looking at his ass anymore. I\u2019m looking at the general vicinity of Paige\u2019s crotch as she steps into my line of vision.</p><p>I look up at her with a scowl and she raises her eyebrows at me. \u201cI saw that, so don\u2019t try to deny it.\u201d</p><p>I pretend like I have no idea what she\u2019s talking about as Sven fires up the blow dryer and goes to town on my hair.</p><p>\u201cSaw what? There\u2019s nothing to see here,\u201d I argue.</p><p>\u201cOh, nonsense,\u201d Sven butts in. \u201cVe all saw you looking at hees ass.\u201d</p><p>Paige laughs as I glare at her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be angry, Kennedy. It\u2019s a very nice ass. What I\u2019d like to know is, why, in all the conversations we\u2019ve had about your dear, old friend Griffin, have you never mentioned what a fine specimen that man is?\u201d Paige demands, putting her hands on her hips.</p><p>\u201cGriffin? Good-looking? Pshaw,\u201d I reply, brushing off her comment.</p><p>Griffin isn\u2019t good-looking. Griffin is hot as balls. But Paige doesn\u2019t need to know that I know that she knows I know that. Holy hell, I may have had this hair dye in my hair too long.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me that bullshit, Kennedy O\u2019Brien. Your eyes got all dreamy when he was bent over whispering in your ear just a second ago,\u201d she fires back.</p><p>\u201cMy eyes did not get all dreamy! I don\u2019t do dreamy!\u201d I shout above the noise of the hair dryer.</p><p>Mrs. Justin Bieber waddles over at this point, stands by my feet, and then yaps at me. One short, high-pitch yipe.</p><p>\u201cSee? Mrs. Justin Bieber even know you lying,\u201d Sven adds.</p><p>\u201cLook, I get that he pissed you off. You thought he was your friend and he did something that hurt you. But he\u2019s trying. He wants to talk to you and maybe it\u2019s time you give him a chance to tell his side of the story. If you won\u2019t, I will. Of course, that man won\u2019t have time to talk if I have a few minutes alone with him.\u201d Paige licks her lips as she stares at the door through which Griffin exited moments ago.</p><p>If my hair wasn\u2019t wrapped around a brush right now and I didn\u2019t fear losing a large chunk of it by yanking away, I would spring from this chair and smack the horny right off her face. Just the idea of Griffin and Paige alone in a room together doing everything but talking makes me want to throw up in my mouth a little. Just because I\u2019m pissed at the guy doesn\u2019t mean I want him anywhere near one of my friends. My hot model friend who has never had a bad-hair day in her life and never stood in front of a person after months of not speaking to him with foil in her hair, looking like an idiot.</p><p>Griffin is going to go back to whatever hole he crawled out of, I\u2019m going to catch McFadden on my own, and I am never, ever going to get caught ogling that man\u2019s ass ever again.</p><p>GD fine ass.</p><p>CHAPTER 7</p><p>But Mooooooom, everyone is going to be at Stephanie\u2019s party. Why can\u2019t I go?\u201d my oldest daughter, Meadow, whines.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re twelve. Do you know what kind of twelve-year-olds go to co-ed parties when there aren\u2019t any parents home? Slutty ones, that\u2019s who,\u201d I inform her as I put the last of the supper dishes into the dishwasher. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Meadow is going to be the death of me. I thought having two daughters was going to be trying enough considering I know nothing about being girly. Thank God I have Paige and Lorelei now. At least they can take her shopping when she doesn\u2019t like the jeans and T-shirts I pick out for her. I know you\u2019re not supposed to force your children to be like you, but come on, what parent doesn\u2019t at least try?</p><p>I put her in karate class when she was four and she spent the entire six-week lesson doing pirouettes around the other kids and breaking out into random dance moves instead of kicking some ass. I gave her all of my old G.I. Joe guys to play with when she was six and she gave them all makeovers with nail polish and glitter glue. G.I. Joe can never show his face in the line of duty again. When she turned seven I finally had to suck it up and buy her a Barbie.</p><p>\u201cOh my GOD, you are ruining my life!\u201d Meadow screeches at me before stomping out of the kitchen.</p> <p>\u201cYOU\u2019RE WELCOME!\u201d I shout in reply.</p><p>Seriously, she\u2019ll thank me one day when she\u2019s paying a shrink and getting her money\u2019s worth.</p><p>Heading over to the fridge, I grab a much-needed bottle of beer and before I can take my first sip, I\u2019m interrupted by a sigh behind me.</p><p>Turning around, I see my youngest daughter, Livia, staring up at me with the same annoyed look on her face that I\u2019m sure I have. Yes, I named my daughters after characters on The Sopranos. It\u2019s in my blood to name my offspring after famous people.</p><p>\u201cMeadow is in her room screaming about how much her life sucks. Can we trade her in for a new sister?\u201d</p> <p>Livia is nine and so much like me it\u2019s scary. Everyone calls her my mini-me. Not only does she look exactly like me with long, wavy auburn hair, but she also hates the color pink, her favorite movie is Full Metal Jacket, and on her Christmas list last year, she asked Santa for a Wenger Ueli Steck Special Edition Swiss Army knife.</p><p>I\u2019m not gonna lie; I cried a few tears when I saw that at the top of the list.</p><p>\u201cNo, we cannot trade your sister in for a new model. It\u2019s just a phase. She\u2019ll get over it.\u201d</p><p>I hope.</p><p>\u201cWhy does she want to go to a party with boys anyway? Boys are dumb. And gross,\u201d Livia replies.</p><p>Amen, sister.</p> <p>Boys are definitely dumb. Especially Alex. He was supposed to pick up the girls tonight and take them to dinner but cancelled at the last minute. Via text. He couldn\u2019t even be decent enough to call and tell me, the rat bastard. Meadow immediately tried to take advantage of the situation by telling me that the only thing that would fix her devastation at being stood up by her father was to go to a party. It was a nice try on her part, but I wasn\u2019t born yesterday. Livia, never one to let something like that ruin her day, just shrugged and asked what was for dinner.</p><p>Before I can sit Livia down and explain to her all the reasons that boys suck and why she should stay away from them forever, the doorbell rings. For a second as I leave Livia in the kitchen to go answer the door, I actually think it\u2019s Alex, coming over to beg forgiveness from the girls and trying to be a stand-up guy.</p><p>I should have known better.</p><p>Checking the peephole, I groan when I see Griffin standing on the front porch and fling the door open.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d I demand as Livia comes up behind me and shoves me out of the way to go barreling into his arms.</p><p>\u201cUncle Griffin!\u201d</p><p>He scoops her up with ease and swings her around in circles on the front porch.</p><p>\u201cLook at how big you\u2019ve gotten. You\u2019re going to be taller than me soon,\u201d he tells her before setting her back down on her feet. \u201cI told you we\u2019d talk later, Kennedy. It\u2019s later.\u201d</p> <p>Why? Why does he choose now to be a man of his word?</p><p>\u201cLiv, why don\u2019t you go into your room and look through that new Soldier of Fortune magazine I got you?\u201d I step aside so Griffin can come into the house, closing the door behind him. I\u2019d really much rather slam the door in his face, but I\u2019d never do that in front of Livia.</p><p>Griffin has always been amazing with my girls and they adore him. I feel a twinge of guilt over the fact that I shut him out of their lives as well. They\u2019ve had a hard enough time dealing with the divorce ever since it was finalized a few weeks ago and their father being so self-absorbed that he can\u2019t even spend an hour with them every couple of weeks. Maybe I can try to be the bigger person here for their sakes.</p><p>Livia throws her arms around Griffin\u2019s waist and squeezes tight before racing off down the hall to her room.</p><p>\u201cSoldier of Fortune?\u201d Griffin asks me with a smile and a raise of his eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cOh, please. Don\u2019t act like that\u2019s a surprise. You\u2019re the one who bought her a camo bed set and all eleven seasons of M*A*S*H on DVD for her birthday last month,\u201d I remind him, my heart constricting at the fact that even during our estrangement he still remembered my daughter\u2019s birthday.</p><p>We stand there in the foyer staring at each other for a few minutes and the silence grows uncomfortable. Griffin and I have never been at a loss for words around each other. Even in the past when I\u2019ve been irritated with him and his blatant, flirty comments or annoyed when he acts like a typical, self-absorbed guy, I had a lot to say.</p><p>This momentary truce I\u2019ve declared in my head thirty seconds ago is already starting to mess with me. Standing here this close to him, I\u2019m forgetting why I was even mad at him in the first place. Griffin moved to town after Alex and I had been dating for a few months, and suddenly I started to have doubts about my feelings for Alex. For a little while, it was a serious struggle for me to be around Griffin and not fantasize about being with him. To make matters worse, Griffin and Alex quickly became good friends and the three of us spent practically every waking moment together. He was sweet and thoughtful, even as a teenager, and he proved time and time again what a loyal friend he was to both of us.</p><p>A week before prom, Alex and I got into a typical teenage fight over something stupid and decided to take a break. Griffin, whom I\u2019m assuming felt sorry for me, saved the day and told me he would be my date instead. I thought it was fate finally getting her shit together and deciding to join my side. Unfortunately, Griffin\u2019s ex-girlfriend at the time found out he asked me and she suddenly realized how much she loved him and begged him back. Griffin ditched me. Alex and I made up and the rest is history.</p><p>Or at least I thought. These past few days have been the first time I\u2019ve been alone with Griffin since I dumped even the idea of Alex and me. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve been single around him since high school and I\u2019m suddenly reminded of all the reasons why I had such a huge crush on him back then. It\u2019s all I can do not to imagine him naked.</p><p>\u201cSo, are you ready to talk to me yet?\u201d he asks, finally breaking the silence.</p><p>I take a step back from him and clear all thoughts of him in the buff from my head. It\u2019s making me twitchy.</p><p>\u201cThat depends. Are you going to try and feed me the same line of bullshit you did six months ago?\u201d I ask as I cross my arms in front of me and stare him down.</p><p>He sighs deeply and runs his hand through his hair, making it stick up in all directions. He always does that when he\u2019s frustrated or angry. I wonder which it is right now. It\u2019s probably both.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t bullshit, Kennedy. You only heard part of that conversation. I swear to you, I had no idea he was having an actual relationship with that woman.\u201d</p><p>I scoff at him and roll my eyes.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s be honest here. She\u2019s not a woman; she\u2019s a child. A home-wrecking, slutty child and you condoned his behavior and told him to keep it from me,\u201d I tell him, trying to keep my voice down so the girls won\u2019t hear me.</p><p>\u201cI should have never said that. At the time, I thought it was just a one-time thing. I thought he had just fucked up and it was never going to happen again. I knew it would kill you if you found out. And I didn\u2019t know you already had,\u201d he says.</p><p>He could be telling the truth. A part of me thinks it\u2019s kind of nice, albeit misguided, that he wanted to do what he could to save me from being hurt. But a bigger part of me has a hard time believing anything he says. The name of our business isn\u2019t Fool Me Once just for shits and giggles. I\u2019ve lost my faith in mankind. Well, I\u2019ve lost my faith in man, kind or not. Period.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to him at all since I found out the truth. I told him he was a lying sack of shit and a pathetic excuse for a man for doing that to you and the girls. He\u2019s tried calling me a bunch of times since then and I\u2019ve ignored him. You know that you, Meadow, and Livia have always been my top priority.\u201d</p><p>At least that part isn\u2019t a lie; he\u2019s always made sure the girls and I are taken care of. Even with my giving him the cold shoulder and refusing to have anything to do with him the last six months, he\u2019s still called to talk to the girls and sent them gifts. And I know for a fact he\u2019s the one who hired a landscaper to mow my lawn every week, even though I know he won\u2019t admit it.</p><p>I always used to ask him why he never settled down and got married since I was sure he\u2019d make an amazing husband and father. He would just shake his head and laugh and tell me that he\u2019d get married when his dream girl became available. Then Alex would always pipe in about Griffin\u2019s celebrity crush\u2014Megan Fox\u2014and make a joke about her being too good for him.</p><p>\u201cWell, the pathetic excuse for a man you speak of has gotten worse. He hasn\u2019t seen his daughters in two months. He was supposed to pick them up for dinner tonight and cancelled at the last minute. I\u2019m sure Chloe with an e had episodes of Sesame Street she needed to watch or something.\u201d I try to make light of the situation. I can\u2019t take the heavy stuff right now. I can\u2019t handle thinking about how much I\u2019ve missed having Griffin in my life.</p><p>\u201cChloe with an e? Am I missing something? Is there some other way you spell Chloe?\u201d he asks with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cHe actually brought her to Uncle Wally and Aunt Janet\u2019s anniversary party a few months ago. He assumed that since he got an invitation before he cheated on me, he\u2019d still be welcome. They stayed long enough for her to introduce herself. \u2018Like, hi everyone! I\u2019m Chloe, with an e!\u2019\u201d I say in a singsong, squeaky voice. \u201cBobby and Ted dragged Alex outside and told him they would use him for target practice if he ever showed his face at one of our family get-togethers again with that whore.\u201d</p><p>Even though I wanted to puke when they walked into the restaurant together hand in hand, the night was made all better by watching Alex sob like a baby out in the parking lot. Real tears and everything. It was beautiful. If only he would have wet himself, I could have died a happy woman. Maybe next time.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an asshole,\u201d Griffin growled.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes he is. Unfortunately though, there\u2019s nothing I can do about his assholishness. He\u2019s going to continue to let the girls down and all I can do is sit back and pick up the pieces,\u201d I tell him with a sigh. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t want to talk about this anymore. All I want to think about right now is catching McFadden because he\u2019s really pissing me off. Thank you for saving my ass when he tried shooting at me. I appreciate it. But I work alone.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s one thing to go easy on the guy so that he can still be in Meadow\u2019s and Livia\u2019s lives, it\u2019s a whole other thing to work side by side with him and try not to think about banging him. Or if he has birthmarks in any special places. Or tattoos that can only be seen with his pants off.</p><p>\u201cI figured you\u2019d say that. Which is why I came here tonight with a proposition for you,\u201d Griffin tells me, one side of his mouth tipping up into his signature grin.</p><p>I\u2019m always a sucker for this man\u2019s smile and will agree to anything when he aims it in my direction. I should know by now just to run away when I see it.</p><p>\u201cFine. What\u2019s your proposition?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Obviously, I\u2019m a moron.</p><p>\u201cHow about a little wager? We\u2019ll each do our own separate thing. I didn\u2019t reenlist with the army and I\u2019m on furlough from the police force right now because of budget cuts, so I need the work. But I\u2019ll leave you alone to chase after McFadden. If you catch him first, you win.\u201d</p><p>Who doesn\u2019t like a little bet? My heritage practically screams gambling aficionado; we go to the church and bet on simulcast horse racing all in the name of Jesus. If a Notre Dame game starts to get a little boring (don\u2019t tell my father I said that), we\u2019ll start placing bets on anything we can think of.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got five on that super fan in the first row taking his shirt off before the third quarter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDouble or nothing on the announcer saying the phrase \u2018ball and sack\u2019 in the same sentence by the end of the quarter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wash your car for a week if there\u2019s a Budweiser commercial during the next break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do I win, since we both know I\u2019m going to get him first?\u201d I ask with my own cocky smile.</p><p>\u201cIf you bring him in before I do, I\u2019ll let you get in one good solid punch to make up for the hurt I caused you,\u201d he replies.</p><p>Oh, man. He knows exactly how to sweet-talk a girl.</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>I quickly accept the bargain with a firm shake of his hand and as he\u2019s opening the front door to leave, my brain finally gets with the program and I realize I just agreed to this thing without asking what he would get if he caught McFadden first.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d I shout to him as he gets to the bottom step and heads toward his motorcycle parked at the curb. \u201cI know it\u2019s a long shot, but what do you win if you catch him first?\u201d</p><p>Griffin grabs his helmet and after securing it on his head and swinging his leg to straddle the bike, he turns to look at me, and son of a bitch if I can\u2019t see the twinkle in his eyes through the visor of the helmet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf I win, you have to go on a date with me.\u201d</p><p>He starts up the bike with a roar of the engine and peels away from the curb, and I swear to God I can hear him laughing as he takes off down the street.</p><p>I walk back into the house with a slam of the front door and stand in my foyer cursing myself and my stupidity.</p> <p>GD gambling problem.</p><p>CHAPTER 8</p><p>Come on, ladies\u2014harder! Faster!\u201d</p><p>I hear a snicker from the corner of the exercise room at the fitness center and turn to see Paige thrusting her hips in the general direction of the heavy bag instead of punching it.</p><p>\u201cKeep it up, McCarty, and you\u2019re going to run laps around the gym,\u201d I threaten her.</p> <p>Paige gives me the finger and a sweet smile before turning back to the bag and punching it for all she\u2019s worth. I scan the rest of my class of about twenty women ranging in ages from sixteen to sixty and I smile at the progress they\u2019ve made in the last few months. Most of them couldn\u2019t have hurt a fly when they walked in this room. Now, after a lot of hands-on instruction and some added kickboxing cardio, they can take down men twice their size.</p><p>I thought my Friday night self-defense class would be a good way to forget about Griffin\u2019s stupid proposal. Unfortunately, nothing is working in that department. I can\u2019t stop wondering if he\u2019s serious or not. And if he is serious, what the hell is he thinking? A date? With me? Is he out of his mind? First of all, we\u2019re friends. Or we used to be. And sort of are now, I guess. Or are we? Where the hell do we stand? I glance at the clock on the wall and realize it\u2019s five minutes past quitting time.</p><p>\u201cAll right, class, time\u2019s up. Great job. I\u2019ll see you all next week.\u201d</p><p>The sounds of twenty women hitting their heavy bags ceases and as they say their good-byes to each other and pack up their things, I walk over to Paige and Lorelei, who are sitting against the far wall chugging back water from their water bottles.</p><p>\u201cWere you trying to kill us? I think my heart just exploded. Check my pulse.\u201d Paige thrusts her wrist out to me.</p><p>I stare at her in irritation. Even after an hour-long workout, she still looks perfect. Not one piece of hair is out of place and she hasn\u2019t even broken a sweat. Everyone else filing out of the room looks like they went ten rounds with Mike Tyson.</p> <p>\u201cHow do you do that? How do you walk out of here looking exactly like you did when you walked in?\u201d I demand as I take a seat across from them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a gift. Now, tell us why you kicked our asses tonight a hell of a lot harder than you normally do.\u201d</p><p>I sigh and start picking at the laces on my tennis shoes. \u201cI made a bet with Griffin that if he catches McFadden before I do, I have to go on a date with him. Does that mean he asked me out on a date? I don\u2019t know. Probably not. Or did he? Sort of. I think.\u201d</p><p>Paige\u2019s face immediately takes on a far-off, happy look and she folds her hands neatly under her chin. \u201cThat is so romantic. What are you going to wear?\u201d</p><p>I ignore her and turn to Lorelei, my voice of reason.</p><p>\u201cYou told him no, right?\u201d she demands. \u201cI mean, this is the jerk who never told you Alex was cheating on you. Is he insane? He\u2019s lucky you didn\u2019t kick him in the balls as soon as the words left his mouth.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m immediately bolstered by the fact that Lorelei used the word balls in a sentence and is on my side.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m sayin\u2019,\u201d I reply, nodding my head in agreement.</p> <p>\u201cOh, for the love of God. You two need to stop being Bitter Bettys. Not all men are jerks,\u201d Paige complains.</p><p>Lorelei and I stare at her in shock. Is she forgetting the name of our business and WHY we opened it in the first place? All men are most certainly jerks. The stacks of case files on our desks are living proof.</p><p>\u201cWhat is wrong with you? How can you say that after what Andy did to you?\u201d Lorelei questions her.</p><p>\u201cWell, Andy should die in the fiery pits of hell and I think I\u2019m allowed a little extra time to be bitter. You didn\u2019t see the black Louboutins I was denied from buying in Nordstrom that day. But I can still have hope for the future for my two best friends,\u201d Paige tells us.</p><p>\u201cWell, good luck with that. I\u2019m staying single forever. There is no man worth giving up my independence for,\u201d Lorelei says.</p><p>\u201cRight there with you, sister,\u201d I agree as I put my fist up in the air to bump with hers and she just stares at it like it\u2019s going to bite her.</p><p>\u201cYou two are impossible. You\u2019re going to change your minds when you meet the right guy. And I\u2019m pretty sure Kennedy here is going to be the first one eating her words. So, when\u2019s the big date and can I do your hair?\u201d</p><p>I scoff at her and push myself up from the floor.</p><p>\u201cI am not going on a date with Griffin Crawford.\u201d</p><p>Am I? No, no I\u2019m not. It\u2019s insanity to even think that for a second.</p><p>But he\u2019s sweet, and good to your girls and every time you\u2019re around him all you can think about is taking his pants off.</p><p>SHUT UP, evil Kennedy!</p><p>He\u2019s an arrogant jerk who lied to your face and probably wouldn\u2019t hesitate to do it again.</p><p>Thank you, good Kennedy.</p><p>\u201cWhy did he even ask you out in the first place?\u201d Lorelei questions as she and Paige follow me toward the exit.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t ask me out, remember? It\u2019s just a stupid bet. I guess. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t even know if he was serious,\u201d I complain. \u201cI heard the word bet and all rational thought left the building.\u201d</p><p>As we walk to our cars, I explain to them in great detail about how he showed up at my house the previous night trying to plead his case and his parting words before he got on his bike and drove off into the night.</p><p>\u201cOh my God. You know what this means, right?\u201d Lorelei presses the button on her key fob for her sleek, black Mercedes.</p><p>\u201cThat Kennedy and Griffin are going to go on this date, fall in love, and live happily ever after?\u201d Paige tries, but can\u2019t hide the smile on her face.</p><p>\u201cWill you pipe down with that shit?\u201d I complain.</p><p>\u201cNo, it means that Griffin Crawford is going down,\u201d Lorelei states.</p><p>\u201cOooooh, that\u2019s hot,\u201d Paige coos.</p><p>Great. Now I have images of him naked with his face between my legs floating around in my head. This is not good. Not good at all.</p><p>\u201cGet your mind out of the gutter, Paige,\u201d Lorelei scolds. \u201cThere are three of us and one of him. We are smart, resourceful, and good at what we do. If we can\u2019t catch that twit McFadden and you lose this bet, I will turn my back on everything I believe in and go out on a date myself.\u201d</p><p>Lorelei is right. Why the hell am I even worrying about the possibility of having to go on a date with Griffin? There is no way we\u2019re going to lose because we kick fucking ass.</p><p>\u201cYou guys will seriously help me do this?\u201d I ask, pulling open my car door and throwing my bag into the passenger seat.</p><p>\u201cOf course we will. That\u2019s what friends are for,\u201d Lorelei states matter-of-factly.</p><p>I turn to look at Paige and she stands there with her arms folded in silence until Lorelei finally smacks her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cUgggghhhh, fine! I\u2019m in. But for the record, I still think you should just go on a regular date with the guy.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring her and the little butterflies in my stomach when I imagine what a date with Griffin would be like, I reach in and grab my cell phone out of the center console of my car and check my e-mail. When I see a fellow investigator\u2019s name at the top, I almost jump up and down in excitement.</p><p>\u201cHow would you girls feel about getting to work on winning this thing tonight? One of my contacts heard through the grapevine that McFadden is going to be trying to sell his alien hats at Mulligan\u2019s Bar and Grill tonight. If we hurry, we can make it there and catch this idiot. Someone\u2019s got to be drunk enough to buy one and stall him.\u201d</p><p>I glance up from my phone to see Lorelei with a huge smile on her face and Paige with an equally large frown.</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>\u201cWe are not going out in public looking like this,\u201d she complains, spreading her arms out, indicating her attire.</p><p>\u201cYou look like you just stepped off the cover of Vogue,\u201d I fire back.</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine. YOU aren\u2019t going out in public looking like that.\u201d</p><p>She points in the general vicinity of my hair, which is pulled up into a messy bun on the top of my head, and then down to my clothes, which include a pair of black nylon running shorts and a baggy, gray man\u2019s T-shirt with ARMY written in block letters across the chest.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a college bar. Who gives a shit what I\u2019m wearing?\u201d I complain.</p><p>\u201cI give a shit what you\u2019re wearing. And so would McFadden\u2014you\u2019ll stick out like a sore thumb. As your friend, I cannot allow you to do this to yourself,\u201d Paige replies.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have time for this. If we don\u2019t hurry, we might miss him. I am NOT losing this bet.\u201d</p><p>Paige walks around to the back end of her red VW Bug convertible and opens the trunk.</p><p>\u201cLucky for you, I always come prepared,\u201d she tells me, pulling out three garment bags and a makeup case the size of a suitcase. \u201cBoth of you hightail it back inside to the showers. I\u2019ll have the two of you runway ready in less than twenty minutes.\u201d</p><p>Lorelei doesn\u2019t put up an ounce of complaint as she turns and hustles back toward the building. Lorelei is always up for one of Paige\u2019s makeovers.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to be runway ready. I need to be ass-kicking ready,\u201d I argue.</p><p>\u201cAre you seriously questioning my ability to do both? It\u2019s like you don\u2019t even know me, Kennedy O\u2019Brien. That cuts me deep,\u201d Paige says with a sigh and a pout.</p><p>Looking at the time on my cell phone, I mutter and curse to myself as I throw my hands up in the air in defeat and trudge along behind Lorelei. There\u2019s no point in arguing with Paige; she will always win. And honestly, there\u2019s a reason why she is the master at catching cheating spouses: she always looks gorgeous, she\u2019s resourceful, and she never takes no for an answer.</p><p>GD model and her guilt trips.</p><p>CHAPTER 9</p><p>I don\u2019t see him yet, do you?\u201d Paige asks as she scans the crowded bar.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t see anything through all this fucking mascara,\u201d I complain as I blink my heavy eyelids and look around the packed room.</p><p>\u201cOh, quit your bitching. You look amazing,\u201d Paige replies as she rests an elbow on the edge of the bar and signals the bartender.</p><p>Looking down at myself, I must agree. After Lorelei and I took the fastest showers ever, Paige unzipped the first garment bag and pulled out a black, pleated dominatrix-style bustier with a zipper down the front and two black buckles across the waist and a pair of skinny Seven jeans. It was badass and it was totally me. Unfortunately, it was also totally Paige\u2019s size since the clothes she keeps stocked in her car are for her assignments.</p><p>As I didn\u2019t have enough time to do anything other than throw on the ill-fitting clothes and hop into the car, Paige jury-rigged my outfit while I drove with a few well-placed safety pins, double-sided tape, and a sewing kit. A pair of tall, pointy-toed matching black boots with buckles on the sides completed the outfit and once they were on and Paige disappeared under the steering wheel while I was stopped at a red light to cuff the bottom of the jeans, you couldn\u2019t even tell they were a mile too long for me.</p><p>I might keep the jeans to replace the ones I ruined during my and Griffin\u2019s roll in the grass. Not to be confused with roll in the hay. Even though sometimes I think I want to be confused with a roll in the hay. With Griffin. Naked. In a bed. Or against a wall. Or on a kitchen table.</p><p>Shit!</p><p>\u201cCould you order me a white wine spritzer, please?\u201d Lorelei asks as she moves to my other side and perches on the edge of a bar stool, wiping the edge of the bar down with a wet wipe before placing her folded hands there.</p><p>As Lorelei scrunches up her nose at the bartender when he tosses down a bowl of peanuts in front of her that spill everywhere, I take in her usual work outfit\u2014a cream, formfitting silk button-down blouse, black straight-leg dress pants, and black patent-leather Mary Janes and I have to admit, Paige really is a genius. Not because she had a perfect Lorelei outfit in her bag, but because she backed down when Lorelei threatened to have her committed if she tried to dress her in a red leather minidress and matching thigh-high stiletto boots.</p><p>\u201cSweetie, this is a dive bar. They probably don\u2019t even know what wine is,\u201d Paige informs her with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m confused. Why would this McFadden guy even come to a place like this? It\u2019s a college bar. It doesn\u2019t seem like his scene,\u201d Lorelei questions as she looks around.</p><p>\u201cSupposedly, he comes here all the time to try and recruit college kids for his cause. I guess drunk twentysomethings must be easy to fool into believing that aliens exist,\u201d I explain as I tug the front of my bustier up a little higher so I\u2019m not arrested for indecent exposure.</p><p>\u201cOr drunk twentysomethings are easy to put foil hats on and convince to prance around the bar,\u201d Paige adds.</p><p>\u201cThat too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God. Oh no. Oh. My. GOD,\u201d Lorelei whispers as she stares with wide eyes at something over my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cReally, it\u2019s not that bad. Just get a rum and Coke or something,\u201d Paige says with a roll of her eyes as she digs in her clutch and pulls out a tube of lip gloss.</p><p>\u201cTurn around. Wait, no. Don\u2019t turn around. Oh my God. Okay, turn around really slowly but act natural,\u201d Lorelei tells us in a voice filled with panic.</p><p>Paige and I completely ignore her instructions and quickly turn around at the same time.</p><p>The blood drains from my face and the noise from the bar suddenly disappears. Across the bar, right by the door, standing arm in arm with a gaggle of girlfriends, is Chloe with an e. I\u2019m now even more appreciative of Paige and her decision to pretty me up before we left the gym. It\u2019s bad enough that this bitch is thirteen years younger than me, but she also looks like Malibu Barbie with long, straight blonde hair, a spray tan, and fake boobs that are so high up on her chest she could rest her chin on them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHere, drink this,\u201d Paige orders as she holds a shot glass full of amber liquid in front of me.</p><p>Without taking my eyes off Hussy the Home Wrecker, I grab the glass and down the shot, letting the fiery burn make its way down my throat and into my stomach. Handing the glass back to Paige, I demand another one and she puts her fingers in her mouth and whistles for the bartender.</p><p>\u201cSomeone needs to give that woman a cheeseburger. She looks like she hasn\u2019t had a good, solid meal since birth,\u201d Lorelei states as she gets up off her bar stool and links her arm through mine.</p> <p>\u201cShe needs to be waterboarded with pasta and potatoes,\u201d Paige agrees as she hands me another shot.</p><p>This one doesn\u2019t burn as it goes down and I\u2019m starting to feel a little better about the fact that I\u2019m in a bar with my ex-husband\u2019s mistress a few feet away and she looks like a porn star.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m fine. Totally fine. No big deal,\u201d I mutter to myself as another shot is placed into my hand.</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s enough shots,\u201d Lorelei tells Paige as some of the alcohol misses my mouth when I tip the glass back and it dribbles down my chin.</p><p>\u201cA little tequila is good for the soul,\u201d Paige replies as she pulls a tissue out of her purse and wipes my chin.</p> <p>The alcohol is starting to kick in and the liquid courage is flowing through my veins. Who cares if she looks like Pamela Anderson and is half my age? Who cares if she can put both her feet behind her head and is so skinny that when she turns sideways she disappears? Not me. I could kick her ass with no arms or legs. I could kick her ass with LORELEI\u2019s arms and legs. I could kick her ass with my newly highlighted hair while swinging Lorelei\u2019s arms and legs over my head.</p><p>I think I\u2019m drunk.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should take her gun away from her,\u201d I hear Lorelei mutter right next to me.</p><p>Just when I think my courage is off the charts, Harlot Barbie turns in my direction and we make eye contact. It could be the jukebox in the corner of the bar messing with me, or it could be the tequila, but I\u2019m pretty sure I just heard the whistling tune of the gun-duel music that plays in old westerns.</p><p>The crowd parts like the Red Sea as she smiles and starts walking in my direction. Barbie\u2019s sidekicks, Skipper and Stacie, follow closely behind her until she stops a foot away from me and they both bump into her back, sending them all stumbling forward in a mess of blonde hair and fake boobs.</p><p>\u201cOh sweet Jesus,\u201d Paige mutters next to me.</p> <p>\u201cKennedy! It\u2019s so good to see you! These are my friends, Misty, with a y and Tiffanie with an ie,\u201d Chloe says brightly.</p><p>\u201cMy IQ just dropped a hundred points,\u201d Lorelei whispers into my ear.</p><p>Suddenly, standing this close to the woman who stole my husband, I don\u2019t feel so good about myself. I can actually feel the tequila churning in my stomach and my awesome hair that Paige styled wilting into an ugly mess.</p><p>\u201cHow have you been? I feel like we haven\u2019t talked in ages,\u201d Chloe says with a pout of her perfect collagen-injected, bright pink lips.</p><p>Is this bitch serious? She\u2019s acting like we\u2019re old friends and not like I walked into my home to find her deep-throating my husband on my couch. MY couch. The brown leather piece of perfection I got on sale before I left for Afghanistan. I had to bleach the couch two days later. And then it was completely ruined. I miss that couch.</p><p>I can\u2019t even find my voice to tell her off. I\u2019ve dreamed of this moment for months: coming face-to-face with my archnemesis in a bar with my friends, full of booze and looking awesome, and telling her exactly what I think of her while pummeling her face into a pile of wet dog food.</p><p>Instead, I feel like a pile of wet dog food. Wet dog food covered in shit and stuck to the bottom of someone\u2019s shoe. I feel inadequate. I never feel inadequate. I never care what people think of me, but right now I feel sorry for myself and I want to go off into the corner and cry into an entire bottle of tequila.</p><p>Before I can cede my title of awesomeness to the better woman, I feel warm hands grab onto my hips and then slide around to my front, pulling me back against a rock-hard chest. I see Chloe, Misty, and Tiffanie\u2019s eyes widen and their mouths drop open as fingers graze my bare shoulder and push my hair to the side before soft lips are pressed to my neck.</p> <p>\u201cHello, gorgeous. Sorry I\u2019m late. Traffic was a bitch.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes as Griffin\u2019s voice rasps right by my ear, just loud enough for everyone in my general vicinity to hear. Without thinking, I turn in his arms and rest my hands against his chest. The corner of his mouth tips up in a mischievous grin as he stares into my eyes. One of his hands comes up and grabs onto the back of my neck, his other hand slides down to my ass and he pulls me roughly up against him. Without even sparing a glance to the three women behind me, his head swoops down and he crashes his lips against mine.</p><p>My brain shorts out and I can practically hear the crackling of electricity in my head when his tongue slides against my lips and I instinctively open my mouth to him. His tongue slides achingly slow against my own as he deepens the kiss and everything around me disappears. I tightly grab on to chunks of his hair on the back of his head to hold him in place as he tilts his head to the side to get a better angle.</p><p>Jesus, God, this man can kiss.</p><p>I raise myself up onto my toes and wrap my arms fully around his neck so I can press as close to him as possible while his mouth works slowly against my own. As his tongue continues to swirl around mine, I feel a tingle shoot through my body and it makes me want to wrap my legs around his hips and slide myself against the hardness I can feel pressed against my lower stomach.</p><p>Somewhere in the back of my mind I hear Lorelei clear her throat loudly and Griffin slows down the kiss, ending it with a few soft pecks on my swollen lips before pulling his head back to stare down at me.</p><p>\u201cUmmmm, so what\u2019s new with you?\u201d I hear Chloe ask from somewhere to my right.</p><p>\u201cSorry to be so rude, but Kennedy can\u2019t talk right now,\u201d Griffin responds without taking his eyes off my face. Normally I would protest when a guy speaks for me, but he\u2019s right. I can\u2019t talk right now. I can\u2019t even feel my legs. Do I still have legs? What day is it?</p><p>He continues to stare directly at my lips as he removes his hand from my ass and reaches into his back pocket, pulling out his wallet and extending his arm out in Paige and Lorelei\u2019s general direction. \u201cNext round of drinks is on me. If you ladies will excuse us, Kennedy and I are going to find a quiet corner where we can be alone.\u201d</p><p>Out of the corner of my eye I see Paige grab Griffin\u2019s wallet. He slides his palm up my arm and pulls one of my hands down from around his neck, entwining our fingers together and then pulling me away from the girls. I follow blindly behind him, not giving a crap where he\u2019s taking me, as long as we can do some more kissing. When we make it far enough away from everyone, he turns to me and lets go of my hand.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that. It looked like you needed a little rescuing.\u201d</p><p>The euphoria from the kiss leaves me with a whoosh and now all I can think about is punching the mouth that was attached to mine moments ago. He didn\u2019t kiss me because he wanted to; he kissed me because he felt like he needed to. I don\u2019t give a shit that his performance was top-notch and that I can feel Chloe and her friends\u2019 eyes boring holes in the back of my head with their envy; all I care about is the fact that I was ready to mount him in the middle of a crowded bar and he just did it for show.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need anyone to rescue me. Especially you,\u201d I growl at him before turning and walking toward the door.</p><p>GD lack of self-control.</p><p>CHAPTER 10</p><p>After a restless night of tossing and turning, where I spent most of my time thinking about kissing Griffin again instead of punching him in the face, I get even more pissed off when I look in my cupboard and realize I don\u2019t have any coffee.</p><p>I swear to God the universe hates me.</p><p>At least today is football day. Football cures everything. Even smug, arrogant bastards who give you the best kiss of your life and then act like it was no big deal. Walking over to my slow cooker, I check on the status of my Buffalo Wing Dip that I always make for game day. I\u2019m not much of a cook, but I can throw together a mean Buffalo Wing Dip.</p><p>\u201cMom, can you take me to the mall? I have nothing to wear to Grandpa\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Turning around, I see Meadow standing in the kitchen naked.</p><p>Okay, not naked, but close enough.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you wearing?\u201d I ask her in shock as I take in one of the A\u00e9ropostale T-shirts I bought her before school started. If you can still call it a T-shirt. It looks like she took a pair of rusty scissors to it and hacked off 90 percent of the material. The sleeves are missing now and the only thing left is the word Aero, which barely covers the boobs she just started growing and leaves her stomach and torso on full display. And now that she\u2019s sprouted up and is almost as tall as I am, she\u2019s decided to confiscate a pair of my Seven jeans, which are riding so low on her hips that if I squint, I can probably see Meadow\u2019s meadow.</p><p>Oh, hell, no.</p><p>\u201cThese are called clothes, Mom,\u201d she tells me in an exasperated voice with a roll of her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou look like a streetwalker. And not even a high-priced one at that. You aren\u2019t going anywhere until you put more clothes on. Preferably a turtleneck. And thermal underwear,\u201d I tell her as calmly as I can with clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cYou are being unreasonable!\u201d she argues with a stomp of her foot.</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m the worst mother in the world and all your friends\u2019 mothers are cooler than me and let their daughters dress like hookers,\u201d I inform her as she lets out a growl of frustration, turns, and stomps out of the room.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll thank me one day when they\u2019re all working at McDonald\u2019s and you\u2019re a doctor!\u201d I yell to her.</p><p>If this is what she\u2019s like before she gets her period, I\u2019m moving out when that day happens. Or shipping her to a convent to let the nuns handle her.</p><p>As I leave the kitchen to go check on Livia and see if she\u2019s ready to go, I\u2019m stopped in the living room by the ringing of the doorbell. Looking through the peephole, I let out a gasp when I see who it is.</p><p>\u201cAlex, what are you doing here?\u201d I ask my ex-husband when I open the door to him.</p><p>I haven\u2019t seen him in months. The only communication we\u2019ve had is through text. For a minute I freak out, wondering if Chloe went home last night and told him about the kiss to end all kisses. He\u2019s wearing a tight-fitting green Hollister T-shirt, a pair of skinny jeans, and black Chucks. He looks like a teenager. Or like he\u2019s having a midlife crisis, which I\u2019m guessing is what happens when you date someone half your age.</p><p>\u201cHi, Kennedy. You\u2019re looking good,\u201d he tells me with a smile. \u201cI thought I\u2019d stop by and see if I could take the girls today. I feel awful that I\u2019ve been so busy lately and haven\u2019t had time to spend with them.\u201d</p><p>To say I\u2019m shocked by his sudden interest in our daughters is an understatement. But then I get a good look at his face and see a black-and-purple bruise discoloring one eye and my mouth drops open. Seeing him with a goatee AND a soul patch is disturbing enough, but seeing him with a black eye is downright unnerving.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened to your face?\u201d</p><p>I watch as his cheeks turn pink from embarrassment and he reaches one hand up to touch the bruise.</p><p>\u201cOh \u0327 this?\u201d he asks with an uncomfortable chuckle. \u201cI ran into a door. No big deal. So, can I take the girls?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s lying. He\u2019s totally lying. I am quite familiar now with the way he acts when he lies. Before I can question him further, he looks over my shoulder and one of his eyebrows rises questioningly.</p><p>\u201cHi, baby. What in the world are you wearing?\u201d</p><p>I turn around, expecting to see Meadow standing behind me in her slut-wear and am pleasantly surprised when I see she took my advice. A little to the extreme though when I see she has on a turtleneck, hooded sweatshirt, drawstring sweatpants, Ugg boots, a scarf, and gloves. I\u2019m sure she thought that by doing this it would make me feel bad, but this child doesn\u2019t realize she\u2019s dealing with the master.</p><p>\u201cMom told me to get dressed. I\u2019m dressed. Are you happy now?\u201d she asks, turning an angry glare in my direction.</p><p>\u201cPerfectly,\u201d I reply with a big smile on my face. \u201cGo get your sister\u2014your father wants to spend the day with you guys.\u201d</p><p>Meadow\u2019s face immediately loses the preteen irritation and she looks at Alex hopefully. \u201cCan we go to the mall?!\u201d</p><p>Alex looks back and forth between Meadow and me uncomfortably and stutters his response. \u201cUh...um...well...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dad would LOVE to take you to the mall!\u201d I say in an excited voice.</p><p>Let him deal with her attitude when she wants to shop at Sluts \u201cR\u201d Us and he vetoes it. At least he better veto it. Considering whom he\u2019s dating, he probably has a frequent-shopper card for every whorish store in the mall.</p><p>Meadow turns and runs excitedly down the hall, yelling for Livia and leaves me alone with Alex again.</p><p>\u201cSo, how have you been? Are you seeing anyone?\u201d Alex asks.</p><p>Geez, nothing like getting right to the point.</p><p>\u201cOh, you know...\u201d I trail off with a shrug.</p><p>DOES he know? Did Chloe fill him in on all the details? The way Griffin only had eyes for me, his hand on my ass, how tightly he held me against him, the slow way he worked me over with his lips and tongue?</p><p>Jesus, it\u2019s hot in here.</p><p>\u201cChloe said she saw you at the bar last night with her girlfriends.\u201d</p><p>Shit. He knows. Am I happy he knows? Maybe he\u2019s jealous. Good. This asshole needs to be jealous. He needs to be burning with rage that I made out with his ex\u2014best friend. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s right! I totally forgot we ran into her.\u201d</p><p>Lies, lies, lies.</p><p>Come on, ask me about Griffin. Ask me about kissing him so I can rub it in your stupid face.</p> <p>\u201cShe said you guys had a good time together.\u201d</p><p>What the fuck? The only good time had by the two of us would be in a boxing ring.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really glad you can be the bigger person, Kennedy. I don\u2019t know if I would be able to do the same thing if I were in your shoes,\u201d he tells me.</p><p>You ARE in my shoes, you asshole! I kissed Griffin! Just admit that you know and that you hate it!</p><p>\u201cDADDY!\u201d Livia comes running into the living room and throws herself in his arms.</p> <p>\u201cHi, princess! I\u2019ve missed you so much,\u201d he tells her as she wraps her legs around him and he holds her in his arms.</p><p>\u201cAre you taking us to the mall? Can we go to Claire\u2019s so I can buy some new earrings and bracelets and then go to the pet shop so I can cuddle the puppies?\u201d she asks sweetly.</p><p>Alex and I both stare at her in confusion for a few minutes before she laughs at both of us.</p><p>\u201cJust kidding! I want to go to the sporting goods store and check out the new crossbows they just got in,\u201d she informs him as he leans over and sets her down on her feet.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m ready to go,\u201d Meadow states as she joins us in the living room. She\u2019s removed all of her winter wear and put my Seven jeans back on, but at least she\u2019s now wearing a shirt that actually covers her body. And decided to add a thick protective layer of makeup.</p><p>\u201cUh, is she allowed to wear makeup?\u201d Alex asks me.</p> <p>\u201cGood luck with that,\u201d I tell him as I lean over and kiss each of the girls good-bye. I\u2019ve had to parent them on my own for months now. It\u2019s his turn.</p><p>As soon as they are out the door, I grab my pot of Buffalo Wing Dip and take it out to my car, securing it in the backseat before pulling out and heading to my father\u2019s house. When I reach his cul-de-sac, my annoyance over the fact that Alex never once mentioned what happened between Griffin and me last night disappears. The street has been blocked off and is filled with my father\u2019s neighbors, all wearing the signature blue-and-gold colors of Notre Dame. I\u2019m pretty sure when they bought this house when my mom was pregnant with Ted, they made it a requirement of the Realtor to find them a house in Notre Dame territory. In the street there are picnic tables, cafeteria tables, and chairs, and enough food to feed an army. Or a herd of football fans. As I slowly pull into my father\u2019s driveway, I see that he and my brothers have brought out his big-screen television and set it in the front yard with an extension cord. Today is going to be a good day.</p><p>Grabbing the Crock-Pot from the backseat, I make my way down the driveway and over to one of the tables where I see my father, Aunt Janet, and Uncle Wally.</p><p>\u201cIs that Buffalo Wing Dip? It better be Buffalo Wing Dip,\u201d Dad tells me as he eyes the Crock-Pot in the crook of my arm.</p><p>I haven\u2019t spoken to my dad since I found out Griffin is the guy he hired, and refusing him his favorite football game snack is a good way to tell him I\u2019m pissed at him about it. I set the Crock-Pot down at the far end of the table, out of his reach.</p><p>\u201cDid you put in an extra cup of cheddar cheese?\u201d he asks, staring at the Crock-Pot instead of me.</p><p>\u201cI put in two extra cups of cheddar cheese. But you\u2019re not getting any of it,\u201d I threaten.</p><p>\u201cAwwwww, come on, Kennedy. I\u2019m an old man. Don\u2019t deny me my Buffalo Wing Dip,\u201d he complains, licking his lips as he watches Uncle Wally lift the lid and take a big whiff.</p> <p>\u201cPut that lid back on, Uncle Wally,\u201d I scold, not taking my eyes off my father.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I do?\u201d Uncle Wally whines.</p><p>\u201cBoth of you know damn well what you did. Anyone care to tell me why they felt the need to hire Griffin to help me on your bail-jumping case?\u201d I ask, crossing my arms in front of me and tapping my foot.</p><p>Aunt Janet pipes up. \u201cGriffin? I haven\u2019t talked to him in a few weeks. How is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not helping,\u201d I tell her through clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cOh, what\u2019s the big deal? I needed extra help and Griffin needed work,\u201d my dad says with a shrug as he slides down the bench seat and reaches for the Crock-Pot lid.</p><p>\u201cThe big deal?\u201d I argue, smacking his hand away as he gives me a dirty look. \u201cThe big deal is that I can\u2019t work with him. He\u2019s cocky and manipulative and annoying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re forgetting handsome, persistent, and a great kisser.\u201d</p><p>I jump in surprise and a squeak flies out of my mouth when I hear Griffin\u2019s voice behind me.</p><p>\u201cKennedy, you kissed Griffin?\u201d Aunt Janet asks excitedly.</p><p>\u201cTechnically, I kissed her. But she was an equal participant,\u201d Griffin replies.</p><p>I hear my aunt mutter, \u201cIt\u2019s about time,\u201d under her breath and I turn around to give him a scathing look for airing this dirty laundry in front of my family. As soon as I look at him though, I\u2019m reminded of that stupid kiss and dammit if I don\u2019t want to haul him off behind the bushes and do it again.</p><p>\u201cSo are you guys dating now?\u201d my father asks with a smile as he quickly shovels in a few mouthfuls of dip.</p><p>Turning away from Griffin\u2019s smiling face, I take a page out of Meadow\u2019s handbook and stomp angrily over to the end of the table. I slam the lid back down on the Crock-Pot, narrowly missing my father\u2019s fingers.</p><p>\u201cHeeeeeeey!\u201d he complains as I snatch the Crock-Pot up from the table and shove it under my arm.</p><p>\u201cNO DIP FOR YOU!\u201d I whirl around and storm toward the house.</p><p>\u201cIf you guys are dating now, you can just split the finder\u2019s fee on McFadden, right?\u201d Uncle Wally shouts to me.</p><p>I hear Griffin\u2019s chuckle as I throw open the door to my father\u2019s house and go inside.</p><p>GD family.</p><p>CHAPTER 11</p><p>I pace angrily back and forth in my father\u2019s kitchen, muttering to myself.</p><p>\u201cStupid man and his stupid infuriating grin. Stupid family. Stupid me for thinking about that damn kiss...\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we talk, or do you need a minute?\u201d Griffin asks as I turn and see him lounging against the doorway with a smile on his face.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>He pushes off the wall and walks over to me in the middle of the kitchen. Reaching up with one hand, he brushes a strand of hair out of my eyes with his fingertips and I have to fight the urge not to shiver when his fingers graze the skin of my forehead. I notice something out of the corner of my eye though and I grab his hand and hold it in front of my face.</p><p>\u201cWhy are your knuckles bruised?\u201d I demand as I stare at the red, swollen area and lightly run my thumb over it.</p><p>He shrugs and pulls his hand out of my grasp. \u201cOh, you know. Ran into a door or something. I don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>It occurs to me that Alex gave me the same answer when I asked him what happened to his face.</p><p>\u201cGriffin, what did you do?\u201d I demand.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d he answers quickly.</p><p>Oh my God. He punched Alex in the face. Why did he punch Alex in the face now? I told him the other night about Alex being a deadbeat dad and then this morning, Alex suddenly shows up at my house with a shiner, wanting to spend time with the girls. Did he seriously go to Alex\u2019s apartment and beat him up for me? For the girls? This should piss me off. Alex should want to spend time with his own daughters without needing his face rearranged to do it. It doesn\u2019t piss me off though; it melts my frozen heart.</p><p>\u201cGriffin,\u201d I whisper softly, looking up into his face.</p><p>\u201cDid he pick the girls up?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I nod in response, unable to speak.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>He brings his hand up and cups my cheek in his palm, rubbing his thumb slowly back and forth against the side of my face, staring at my mouth. I feel my insides melting into a puddle of goo and I want him to kiss me so badly I feel like I\u2019m going to scream if he doesn\u2019t do it already.</p><p>As he eases his head down to me, I start to close my eyes in anticipation of his lips against mine. Then, my stupid brain has to interfere and I remember what happened last night. It was all fun and games until the kiss was over.</p><p>Putting both of my hands flat against his chest, I shove him away angrily and take a few steps back.</p><p>\u201cNo. No, no, no. You don\u2019t get to kiss me again. Not after that crap last night,\u201d I tell him angrily.</p><p>\u201cCrap? I thought that kiss was pretty amazing. Crap? Really?\u201d he asks again in shock.</p><p>How can a man this good-looking be so dense?</p><p>\u201cI thought you needed rescuing,\u201d I say in a mocking voice, just like his the previous night. \u201cI don\u2019t need you, or anyone to rescue me. And I definitely don\u2019t need you or any man to kiss me because he feels sorry for me.\u201d</p><p>I watch as the lightbulb finally clicks on and the humor in his eyes gets replaced by something fierce as he stalks toward me. I quickly move backward until I bump up against the counter and have nowhere else to go. Griffin puts his arms on either side of me on the counter, caging me in.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get something straight here,\u201d he tells me with a firm voice. \u201cI have never felt sorry for you. When I kiss you, it\u2019s because I want to, not because I have to. I saw the look on your face last night. You felt like shit next to that girl. You\u2019re too much of a stubborn hard-ass to feel like less than you are around anyone. Especially someone like her.\u201d</p><p>His eyes bore into mine and butterflies flap manically around in my stomach. Why is it so hard to stay mad at this man?</p><p>Without giving it a second thought, I grab the front of his shirt with both of my fists and haul him toward me, crashing my lips against his. Right now, I don\u2019t care how bad of an idea this is. No one has ever said anything like that to me before and meant it.</p><p>Griffin immediately pushes his tongue past my lips and I moan into his mouth when I taste him again. He grabs onto my hips and effortlessly lifts me up onto the counter. My legs immediately wrap around his waist and my hands fist in his hair as he swirls his tongue through my mouth and pushes his hips between my legs. I can feel his erection again, just like last night, but this time, the hardness of him is right where I want it, pushing against the ache that formed as soon as he spoke those words to me. His hands slide around to my ass and he pulls me closer to the edge of the counter. I instinctively thrust my hips against him and it\u2019s his turn to groan.</p><p>It\u2019s been far too long since I\u2019ve felt this needy. Every inch of my body is on fire and I can\u2019t stop pushing my body against him. Jesus, he feels so good between my legs, sliding himself against me. I\u2019m ashamed to admit that if he keeps this up, I\u2019m probably going to have the fastest orgasm known to man. Or woman. His lips leave mine and he makes a trail of kisses across my cheek and to the side of my neck as he grips my ass and moves me against him. The tip of his tongue traces the edge of my earlobe before he tugs on it gently with his teeth.</p><p>\u201cFuck, you taste good. I\u2019ve wanted you like this for eighteen years,\u201d he murmurs, pressing a kiss to my neck.</p><p>Whoa. The fuck?</p><p>My hands, which are still locked in a death grip in his hair, tighten hard enough to pull some strands out as I yank his head away from my neck and stare angrily in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d</p><p>He tries to move back toward my lips, but I stop him, pulling on his hair even harder until he yelps. \u201cOuch! Easy on the hair!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me you did not just say what I think you said!\u201d</p><p>Griffin sighs and bows his head.</p><p>Holy shit. He\u2019s serious. How did I not know this? And why the hell am I just finding out about this NOW? I thought the whole \u201cgo on a date with me\u201d thing was just to bait me. Why the hell am I suddenly regretting all of the years I wasted with Alex when I could have had Griffin? SHIT! NO! He\u2019s a friend. A friend who can kiss like a god and almost make me come on my father\u2019s kitchen counter. We need to talk about this. This is serious business. I\u2019m not ready for serious business. Why am I even questioning myself?</p><p>\u201cSo I guess this means you ARE dating?\u201d my father asks from the kitchen doorway.</p><p>\u201cGAAAAAAAAH!\u201d I scream in frustration as I push Griffin away and jump down off the counter.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Griffin replies calmly.</p><p>\u201cWe most certainly are NOT dating!\u201d I yell at Griffin.</p><p>\u201cJust a matter of time until I catch McFadden,\u201d he tells me with a grin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to wipe that smile off your face when I catch him and punch you square in the mouth!\u201d I shout back.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on here, and I don\u2019t care. I just came in to get the dip,\u201d my father replies with a longing look toward the Crock-Pot resting on the counter right next to where I had been close to orgasm. Griffin wanted me for eighteen years and never said a word about it until now.</p><p>SHIT!</p><p>\u201cAm I interrupting something?\u201d Paige asks as she enters the kitchen and sees all of us standing here.</p><p>\u201cNO!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Griffin and I state again at the same time, causing me to growl in frustration.</p><p>\u201cI think they\u2019re dating. I just want my dip. Tell her to give me my dip, Paige,\u201d my dad whines.</p><p>\u201cDid you lose the bet?\u201d Paige asks me in confusion.</p><p>\u201cWhat bet?\u201d Dad asks.</p><p>\u201cGriffin bet Kennedy that if he finds McFadden first, she has to go on a date with him,\u201d Paige informs him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got ten on Griffin,\u201d Dad tells her, reaching for his wallet.</p><p>\u201cDAD!\u201d</p><p>Griffin laughs as he leans against the counter and folds his arms in front of him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that bet, and raise you twenty,\u201d Paige replies. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At least someone is on my side.</p><p>\u201cKennedy, do you have your gun on you?\u201d she asks as she pulls her purse off her shoulder and starts digging through it.</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah. Why?\u201d</p> <p>Paige finds her wallet and counts out thirty dollars, slapping it down on the kitchen table.</p><p>\u201cBecause, McFadden is outside flipping burgers three houses down.\u201d</p><p>Griffin pushes away from the counter and his arms fall to his sides. We look at each other in silence for five seconds before we both take off at a dead run out of the kitchen, shoving Paige and my father out of the way.</p><p>\u201cYou could have led with that, you know!\u201d I yell at Paige as I race to the front door.</p><p>\u201cThis was more fun!\u201d she shouts back as Griffin and I fight over the door handle, pushing and shoving each other out of the way. Griffin slams his hip into mine and I stumble backward as he flings open the front door, sprinting outside into the sunshine. I take off after him while I curse Paige. She could have pulled me aside and told me about McFadden quietly.</p> <p>GD lack of loyalty.</p><p>CHAPTER 12</p><p>I race down the front porch just in time to see Griffin standing in the middle of the yard looking left to right, trying to decide which direction to run. My dad\u2019s house is right smack in the middle of the cul-de-sac. There are seven houses on either side of his house, each one filled with people getting ready to root on Notre Dame. I need to pick the right direction. WHICH ONE IS THE RIGHT DIRECTION?!</p><p>Looking to my left, I see that Lorelei just arrived. And she\u2019s wearing a maroon-and-gold silk blouse with matching maroon dress pants: Arizona Sun Devils\u2019 colors, the team that Notre Dame is playing today. She\u2019s going to be killed!</p><p>I see her lift her arm and point in the opposite direction that Griffin is currently looking and send her a thumbs-up before sprinting away. She\u2019s on her own; I can\u2019t save her from crazy Notre Dame fans now.</p><p>Running at top speed and yelling for people to get out of my way, I make it to the Andersons\u2019 house, three houses down, in record time.</p> <p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the grill?\u201d I ask the first person I come to through gasps of air.</p><p>\u201cThe burgers aren\u2019t done yet,\u201d a guy with a giant navy-blue foam finger tells me as he uses the foam finger to scratch his nose.</p><p>\u201cWHERE\u2019S THE FUCKING GRILL?!\u201d I scream at him, pulling my gun out of the holster under the back of my shirt.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t even bat an eye when he sees the 9mm in my hand. Half of the people on this street carry guns. Football season is serious business. Plus, most of the people here know that my family all works in some sort of law enforcement.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re that hungry, I heard someone brought Buffalo Wing Dip a few houses down.\u201d He points his foam finger back in the direction I came.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a criminal cooking burgers on your grill. Where is the grill?\u201d I ask again as I check the safety on my gun.</p><p>\u201cBob Anderson is a criminal? Damn, it\u2019s always the quiet ones,\u201d foam-finger guy states with a sad shake of his head.</p><p>I\u2019m going to take his foam finger and shove it up his ass in three seconds.</p> <p>\u201cNo, not Bob Anderson. His name is Martin, he skipped bail, and rumor has it he\u2019s manning the grill at this house,\u201d I tell him through clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cYou mean McFadden? I just met him. Nice guy. And he has a cute dog.\u201d</p><p>Sweet mother of God...</p><p>\u201cThe grill\u2019s around back,\u201d he tells me with another point of his finger. \u201cDon\u2019t shoot the dog!\u201d</p><p>Looking over my shoulder to make sure Griffin isn\u2019t anywhere in sight, I take off running again, keeping myself pressed to the side of the house as I move quickly with my gun in front of me. Peeking around the back corner, I see the grill about ten yards away from the house. And I see McFadden with his back to me, all alone with Tinkerdoodle sitting by his feet staring up at him, hoping one of the burgers he\u2019s flipping drops on the ground.</p><p>Edging out from around the side of the house, I hold my gun out in front of me and creep closer, careful not to make a sound. When I\u2019m within three feet of him, I check my back pocket to make sure the zip ties I usually carry are still back there, ready to be used when I tackle him and secure his hands behind his back.</p><p>\u201cHey, McFadden! Are those burgers almost done?\u201d</p><p>I jump when I hear the yell from foam-finger asshole behind me and McFadden turns around from the grill with a giant spatula in his hand and a smile on his face. The smile dies when he sees me standing here with my gun pointed right at his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou can have the first burger. Just don\u2019t shoot me!\u201d he says nervously.</p><p>\u201cYou are really pissing me off, Martin. Put the spatula down and let\u2019s do this calmly, without making a scene.\u201d</p><p>I can hear people talking behind me and roll my eyes when I realize the backyard is filling up with onlookers, wanting to see what\u2019s going on.</p><p>\u201cJust because she brings a gun, she gets the first burger? I\u2019ve been waiting for twenty minutes,\u201d someone whispers.</p><p>Michelle Anderson, Bob\u2019s wife, comes outside. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, everyone. That\u2019s Buddy\u2019s daughter, Kennedy. She\u2019s like that. Did Martin forget to bring a covered dish? I don\u2019t think you need to shoot him for that.\u201d</p><p>Can I just catch a break here? Seriously.</p><p>\u201cMichelle, this man is a criminal. Can you please get everyone inside and out of danger?\u201d I plead with her.</p><p>\u201cThis is so exciting. It\u2019s like an episode of Cops. Is someone filming this?\u201d Michelle asks, completely ignoring my request as I move closer to McFadden.</p><p>Tinkerdoodle lets out a yippy bark and growls at me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, princess. She isn\u2019t going to shoot Daddy,\u201d McFadden tells the dog. \u201cShe\u2019s one of us. She believes in the \u2018others\u2019 and even bought one of Daddy\u2019s special hats.\u201d</p><p>While McFadden soothes the dog, I take another slow step in his direction and stop when the dog growls at me again.</p><p>\u201cPut the spatula down and walk toward me slowly,\u201d I demand.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we just talk about this? I\u2019ll give you a signed copy of my book,\u201d he pleads.</p><p>Raising the gun higher, so it\u2019s aimed right at his face, I watch him swallow nervously and turn slowly to set the spatula down on the card table next to the grill, filled with buns and a huge cookie sheet of uncooked hamburger meat.</p><p>\u201cJust so you know, I don\u2019t have any hard feelings toward you. We can still be friends after this is over,\u201d he states with his back still to me.</p><p>I take a deep breath and another cautious step in his direction, ignoring the growling dog by my feet with her teeth bared\u2014her tiny little two-pound-dog teeth. I sort of want to laugh at the fact that this dog thinks she\u2019s some kind of badass guard dog.</p><p>When I\u2019m within arm\u2019s reach, McFadden suddenly lets out a yell.</p><p>\u201cTINKERDOODLE\u2014ATTACK!\u201d</p><p>The dog launches itself at my leg in a blur of activity and clamps down on my ankle. I let out a yelp as McFadden whirls around with the cookie sheet of meat in his hand and throws it in my direction. Raw meat rains down on my head while I try to keep the gun on McFadden and shake the stupid dog loose from my pant leg.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch, that ground meat was $3.95 a pound!\u201d Bob Anderson complains from somewhere in the yard.</p><p>Tinkerdoodle finally lets go of my ankle and races back to McFadden, who scoops her up in his arms and takes off running. I turn to go after him and my boot slips right through a slippery pile of ground meat. My feet fly out from under me and I land flat on my back, knocking the wind right out of me as I gasp for breath.</p><p>\u201cSSSSSSSSSS\u2014ssstoooop,\u201d I say through coughs as I turn my head to the side and see McFadden run right by the crowd of people who stand there. He stops and turns to look at me, holding his pinkie and thumb up to the side of his head and shouts, \u201cCall me!\u201d before taking off again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got meat in your hair,\u201d Bob Anderson tells me as he walks up next to me while I struggle to roll over, get up, and breathe at the same time.</p><p>Putting my hand to my chest, I try to take a deep breath and wind up coughing from the exertion. \u201cCriminal. Stop. Can\u2019t. Breathe.\u201d</p><p>Bob looks down at me in confusion as I hack and try to breathe while moving as fast as I can to try to get up off the ground and chase after McFadden. Bob is retired from the police force and if anyone can understand what the hell is going on here, it will be Bob.</p><p>\u201cMcFadden? Nice guy. I just met him this morning. The missus met him at the grocery store and invited him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBail. Jumper,\u201d I mumble between deep, heaving breaths that my lungs finally let me have and my hand squishes down into a pile of raw meat as I push myself up onto my knees.</p><p>\u201cReally? Huh. He didn\u2019t look like a bail jumper,\u201d Bob states.</p><p>I am surrounded by idiots.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with all the commotion? I heard the burgers are ruined,\u201d my dad says as he pushes through the crowd of onlookers and walks next to Bob, who finally gives me a hand and helps me up off the ground. I see McFadden\u2019s Honda go soaring down the street. With a sigh, I turn to my dad in irritation and see him standing there with a Styrofoam plate in his hand filled with my dip and tortilla chips.</p><p>\u201cReally, Dad? You were just in the kitchen with me when Paige told us McFadden was here. You thought it was wise to stop for a snack instead of rushing to my aid?\u201d</p><p>Dad shrugs as he shovels a chip full of dip into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI figured you had it under control. You know you have meat in your hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGOD DAMMIT!\u201d I shout, with a stomp of my foot.</p><p>My dad\u2019s hand flashes out like lightening and smacks me on the back of the head, a chunk of meat coming loose and dropping down on the front of my shirt.</p><p>\u201cT-minus five minutes until kickoff!\u201d one of the neighbors shouts from a few feet away. Everyone in the yard, my father included, lets out a huge yell and they all disperse to head over to his yard where the TV is. The fact that they just witnessed a wanted man escape from a woman with a gun is of no concern to them now that it\u2019s game time.</p><p>With a scowl, I brush the globs of meat off my shirt and see Griffin pushing through the horde of people until he makes it to my side and tries to smother a laugh with his hand.</p><p>\u201cNot a word. Not ONE word,\u201d I threaten him as I walk around him and shove my gun back in its holster.</p><p>\u201cYou have meat on your ass,\u201d he shouts to my back with a laugh.</p><p>GD meat-flinging McFadden.</p><p>CHAPTER 13</p><p>After rinsing all of the raw meat out of my hair and off my skin in my dad\u2019s shower, I step out, wrapping a towel securely around myself. I wipe the steam off the mirror with my hand and run a comb through my hair, pausing when there\u2019s a knock at the door. Figuring it\u2019s either Paige or Lorelei, I begin my tirade as I turn to open it.</p><p>\u201cYou know, a little help from my partners would have been nice when\u2014\u201d</p><p>The words die on my lips when I see Griffin standing there.</p><p>\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t want to be partners. If you\u2019ve changed your mind, just let me know,\u201d he says with a smile, as he looks me up and down. A shiver runs down my spine and it has nothing to do with all the heat from my shower rushing out the open door and everything to do with the way he\u2019s looking at me. Like he wants to lick all of the water off my skin.</p><p>\u201cIf you came up here to gloat, save your breath,\u201d I warn him, securing the towel tighter between my breasts, so it doesn\u2019t fall off.</p><p>Griffin doesn\u2019t say a word as he moves his large body into the small bathroom, forcing me to back up a few steps. With his eyes still locked on mine, I swallow thickly as he shuts the door behind him and turns the lock.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t come up here to gloat, I came up here to talk,\u201d he replies softly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs nonchalantly, snaking one arm around my waist and pulling my towel-clad body roughly up against him. \u201cThat\u2019s an even better idea.\u201d</p><p>Before I can utter a protest, his mouth is on mine.</p><p>What is with this man? In the span of just a few days, he can\u2019t get enough of me.</p><p>One of his hands moves down to my ass and squeezes as his tongue slides past my lips and I forget all about the bet and the meat bath I just rolled in outside and kiss him back. He turns me and pushes my back up against the wall, his hand sliding down to my bare leg, pulling it up around his hip.</p><p>He\u2019s right; we really need to talk. About what he did to Alex, about the bet, about what the hell this thing is going on between us...</p><p>His palm slides up the back of my thigh until he\u2019s clutching my bare ass.</p><p>Okay, talking can wait.</p><p>\u201cKeep your leg there,\u201d he demands softly against my lips.</p><p>I nod in acceptance, knowing full well that at this point, if he asked me to light my hair on fire, I would do it. My body is screaming for him to touch me, I don\u2019t care if there are a hundred people outside the house right now, I just want his fingers on me.</p><p>Shit! There are a hundred people outside right now and his hand is sliding off my ass and over my hip, heading right for the promised land, while he licks some droplets of water off my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cGriffin, there are people outside,\u201d I moan as his fingers skim the inside of my thigh, inching closer and closer to where I want him.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re busy,\u201d he mumbles against the side of my neck as he kisses his way back up to my lips.</p><p>As if to punctuate his statement, I hear the crowd cheer outside right at the exact moment that the tips of his fingers graze between my legs with a featherlight touch.</p><p>First and ten.</p><p>I was wet for him as soon as he walked through the door and his fingers easily slide through my wetness and up to my clit, circling around it as the crowd goes wild again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Forward pass.</p><p>He lets out a groan of desire when he feels how much I want him and finds my lips, sinking his tongue into my mouth at the same time one of his fingers pushes inside of me. I whimper into his mouth and wrap my arms tightly around his shoulders as his finger begins working slowly in and out of me. As I rock my hips against his hand, his finger pushes in deeper and the heel of his hand bumps against my clit each time I thrust forward. I feel myself losing control and my legs start to shake as I move faster and faster and his hand pushes in deeper and harder. He swallows all of my cries against his lips as I race to the edge. I can feel it building quickly as he works me over with his finger. I\u2019ve never come this quickly in my life. I\u2019ve never thrown caution to the wind and just let go. Everything I do is carefully thought out and planned. This is insanity. My orgasm is right there, just beyond my reach, but my brain is starting to interfere and I pull my mouth away from Griffin\u2019s, letting my head thump back against the wall with my eyes squeezed shut.</p><p>His hand stills with his finger pushed as far as it will go inside of me. I feel his lips against my ear a second later and his warm breath washes over me as his thumb circles around and around my clit, ever so gently.</p> <p>I let out a gasp and a low moan when tingles of pleasure shoot through me once again and I buck my hips roughly against his hand.</p><p>\u201cLet go, Kennedy, just let go,\u201d he whispers against my ear.</p><p>His thumb moves faster, back and forth, bringing me right back to the edge and when I feel him curl his finger inside of me, I tumble over, clutching him against me as I cry out through my release and the crowd outside once again starts cheering.</p><p>Touchdown.</p><p>This is the orgasm to end all orgasms and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because it\u2019s Griffin who\u2019s giving it to me, because I\u2019m doing something so out of character, or a little bit of both.</p> <p>\u201cRide it out, baby,\u201d he tells me softly as another shout and round of applause is heard from out in the yard and he pushes a second finger inside me.</p><p>Two point conversion.</p><p>His fingers are stretching me and prolonging my orgasm until I feel like it\u2019s never going to end. I never want it to end and I continue to whimper and gasp as the waves of pleasure just keep coming and coming.</p><p>I can\u2019t catch my breath and I don\u2019t even care. My hips keep moving and his fingers keep pumping inside of me until the pleasure eventually trickles away. Griffin kisses me softly on the lips as he pulls his fingers out of me and my leg falls limply from around his waist.</p><p>Holy Jesus. Who knew that coming along with a football game could be so amazing? More people should try this.</p><p>I feel his body move away from mine and I slowly open one eye to see him adjusting himself in his jeans.</p> <p>I\u2019ve never been much for blowjobs, but right now, there\u2019s nothing else I can think of except sinking down to my knees and taking him in my mouth.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t stop looking at me like that, I\u2019m going to fuck you up against that wall,\u201d Griffin warns me.</p><p>I\u2019ve also never been too keen on dirty talk, but thank God I\u2019m not standing. My knees wouldn\u2019t have held me. I shift my gaze from his crotch to his face and see that he\u2019s completely serious. His hands are clenched into fists at his sides and it looks like it\u2019s taking everything in him not to rip my towel off me and make good on his threat.</p><p>Yes, please.</p><p>Without giving it a second thought, I reach up between my breasts and tug on the edge of the towel tucked there, causing the whole thing to fall off me and land at my feet on the floor.</p><p>\u201cOops,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>I watch as Griffin\u2019s mouth drops open and the bulge between his legs grows bigger.</p><p>He takes a step toward me right as the bathroom door bursts open and slams against the opposite wall, my brother Bobby standing there with a look of horror on his face. Bobby moved in with my dad after his last tour of duty so he could figure out what he wants to do with his life in between tours. Obviously he\u2019s now wishing he lived somewhere else.</p> <p>I scream, Bobby screams, and Griffin dives to the ground to retrieve my towel, bringing it up in front of me and turning his back to give me cover.</p><p>\u201cOH, JESUS, MY EYES! I CAN NEVER UNSEE THIS!\u201d Bobby screams, covering his face with both of his hands, turning around and running blindly down the hall.</p><p>\u201cBOBBY, WHAT THE HELL?\u201d I yell. \u201cThe door was locked, you idiot!\u201d</p><p>Securing the towel back around myself, I can feel my face heating up with embarrassment, all of the euphoria from moments ago long gone. There\u2019s a loud \u201cOoof!\u201d that comes from the hallway followed by Lorelei\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cBobby, what are you doing? Take your hands off your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe lock is broke. Oh, Jesus, the lock is broke. WHY, GOD, WHY?\u201d</p><p>Lorelei peeks her head around the doorway and her eyes widen in surprise when she sees Griffin and me.</p><p>\u201cOh my,\u201d she mutters.</p><p>\u201cHelp,\u201d I manage to squeak out as I stare at her over Griffin\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Lorelei\u2019s head disappears back into the hallway and I hear her console Bobby, who mumbles about how he can\u2019t make his feet move because he\u2019s blind.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m going to be sick,\u201d Bobby whines from the hallway.</p><p>\u201cIn with the good air, out with the bad,\u201d Lorelei coaches him.</p><p>\u201cOh, for the love of God,\u201d I grumble. \u201cWill you people just leave and go back outside!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBobby! Where the hell is the beer?\u201d I hear my dad yell up from the bottom of the stairs and then the unmistakable sound of him stomping up them.</p><p>Jesus. How about we just invite the whole damn neighborhood up here so they can see me half naked and post-orgasmic?</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened to you?\u201d I hear my dad ask Bobby from the stairway as Griffin turns around to face me.</p><p>\u201cThings that can never be unseen. Bad things,\u201d Bobby mumbles.</p><p>I stare straight at Griffin\u2019s chest, refusing to look at him.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Kennedy? Is she done washing meat off herself yet? Quit blocking the hallway. I need her help,\u201d Dad complains.</p><p>\u201cKennedy and Griffin are in there...talking. They need to talk. You know, just talk. About...things,\u201d Lorelei explains to my father.</p><p>Great. Miss Powerhouse Attorney can\u2019t even form a coherent thought right now.</p><p>Bobby makes a gagging noise out in the hallway and if I were fully clothed right now I would go out there and kick his ass.</p><p>\u201cGoddammit,\u201d Bobby moans, followed immediately by the sound of a smack, which I\u2019m assuming is from my father\u2019s hand connecting with the back of Bobby\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cGriffin Crawford, you better be wearing protection while you talk to my daughter. Kennedy, we\u2019re out of dip and Steve Henderson just puked in the shrubs. Get dressed and come help,\u201d my dad yells before he stomps back down the steps.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Bobby, let\u2019s get you some fresh air,\u201d Lorelei states as I hear her dragging him down the stairs.</p><p>When the front door slams shut a few seconds later, Griffin laughs and I finally glance up at him to give him a dirty look.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t funny,\u201d I hiss at him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty funny,\u201d he chuckles. \u201cCan we cancel the bet and just tell everyone we\u2019re dating?\u201d</p><p>Is he out of his mind? One orgasm does NOT equal dating. And the bet was HIS idea. I am seeing this shit through to the bitter end. I don\u2019t date. Especially not someone who throws out a line about wanting me for eighteen years in the middle of a make-out session. I don\u2019t want to date him, I don\u2019t want to fall in love with him, and I don\u2019t want him professing his stupid crush. I don\u2019t need this complication in my life. Thank you for the wonderful orgasm, but I\u2019m done. Seacrest, out!</p><p>\u201cWe are NOT dating. And this bet isn\u2019t over until I win,\u201d I growl at him as I shoulder past him and out the door, my bare feet smacking angrily on the floor as I stomp across the hall to the spare bedroom and the extra clothes I keep there for emergencies.</p><p>\u201cYou should just concede now, Kennedy. You\u2019re never going to win!\u201d Griffin yells to me as I walk into the bedroom and slam the door behind me.</p><p>GD cocky man and his mind-blowing orgasms.</p><p>CHAPTER 14</p><p>Pour me a mother. I mean, pour me another,\u201d I slur as I hold my wine glass out to Lorelei and watch in fascination as the golden liquid splashes into my glass.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so pretty,\u201d I whisper, bringing the glass to my mouth and taking a big sip.</p><p>It\u2019s Monday night, two days after the bathroom debacle. I spent the last two days looking up any and all information I could find on McFadden. Luckily, Alex decided to keep the girls for a few days so I\u2019ve had the house all to myself. I spent every waking moment pouring over every single thing I could find on him from his elementary school grade cards to his most recent STD test. He sucked at math, but at least he doesn\u2019t have VD. I\u2019ve been to every hangout he\u2019s ever been seen at and talked to every contact I have on the street and no one has seen him. I\u2019m losing my touch. Why the hell is it suddenly so hard to find this tool? He\u2019s popped up where I\u2019ve been twice and my informants have spotted him all over the place, but now, nothing. No one has seen or heard from him in two days. I am totally off my game and there is only one person to blame for that.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so tell us again, in detail,\u201d Paige demands as she grabs the bottle of wine from Lorelei and tops off her own glass.</p><p>After not hearing from me for two days, the girls staged an intervention and showed up at my house this evening with enough wine to stock two shelves in my fridge. I\u2019m not a wine drinker; I prefer beer. But since they were the ones buying, I couldn\u2019t be picky.</p><p>Why didn\u2019t anyone tell me wine is so delicious?</p><p>Tucking my feet under me on the couch, I feel myself start to sway back and forth and some of the wine from my glass sloshes onto my jeans.</p><p>\u201cHe has magical fingers, did I mention that part already?\u201d I ask the girls.</p><p>\u201cYes, you\u2019ve mentioned his magic digits several times. Get to the good part, for God\u2019s sake. Tell me you saw his penis,\u201d Paige demands.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to answer that,\u201d Lorelei states firmly as she takes a sip of bottled water. Lorelei has a one-drink minimum. I\u2019ve never seen her drunk. I think it\u2019s physically impossible for her to get drunk.</p><p>\u201cShe most certainly DOES have to answer that. I haven\u2019t seen a penis in months. I need to live vicariously through her,\u201d Paige argues.</p><p>\u201cI did not have sexual relations with that man,\u201d I say in my best Bill Clinton voice. \u201cI also did not get to see the peen.\u201d</p><p>Paige boos and hisses at my announcement and Lorelei rolls her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so there\u2019s been a little bit of a setback with winning this bet. He\u2019s obviously trying to distract you with sex. We need to come up with a new plan of attack.\u201d</p><p>I blink a few times to get Lorelei\u2019s face into focus and see her sitting there tapping her finger against her lips while she thinks.</p><p>What if she\u2019s right? What if all of this was just a ruse to sidetrack me so he could take down McFadden? The kisses, the proclamation, the orgasm...it was all part of his evil master plan. I\u2019ve been so flustered and distracted that I\u2019m not thinking clearly and can\u2019t find a guy who should be easier to track down than this. It should have never taken me this long to catch a bail jumper.</p><p>SON OF A BITCH!</p><p>I jump up from the couch and throw my arms up in the air, forgetting the full glass of wine I still have in my hand as it spills all over the floor and coffee table and splashes on Paige\u2019s shoes.</p><p>\u201cNOT MY JIMMY CHOOS!!!!\u201d Paige screams.</p><p>Reaching for the wine bottle on the coffee table, I stick it right in front of her face. \u201cHere, drink this and don\u2019t think about the shoes.\u201d</p><p>Paige sniffles and takes a sip of wine from her glass and then tips back the wine bottle and starts chugging.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, you do NOT chug a one-hundred-and-fifty-dollar bottle of Domaine Leflaive Chardonnay!\u201d Lorelei shouts as she yanks the bottle away from Paige\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cLorelei, fire up the Batmobile. We\u2019re going on a field trip,\u201d I tell her as she glares at Paige.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Paige shouts as she gets up from the couch and wraps her arms around me.</p><p>\u201cWhat? No. Absolutely not. We are not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Paige and I look at each other and all of the wine I\u2019ve consumed makes it perfectly acceptable that she\u2019s hugging me and in my personal space.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going? Will there be penises?\u201d she whispers with her chin on my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cNo, no penises. Better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than penises? I don\u2019t understand,\u201d Paige replies.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to my dad\u2019s office to fuck up Griffin\u2019s world,\u201d I inform her with an evil smile on my face.</p><p>\u201cOkay, not that I\u2019m condoning this nonsense, but how is going to your dad\u2019s office going to affect Griffin in any way?\u201d Lorelei asks as she sets the bottle of wine down.</p><p>\u201cBecause, my dear, Griffin has a desk at my dad\u2019s office now. A desk and a computer. And files. And notes. Notes on whatever case he\u2019s currently working on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t get it. Will we see his penis there?\u201d Paige questions.</p><p>I ignore Paige and stare directly at Lorelei. Lorelei hates men. Lorelei hates it that Griffin might be using me to get what he wants. I shush the nagging voice in the back of my head telling me that Griffin wants me. Lorelei will understand my need to do whatever I can to get the jump on him and win this bet. He can\u2019t have me. I cannot be had!</p><p>She lets out a huge sigh and stares up at the ceiling for a few minutes before shaking her head at me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFine. But you two are sitting in the backseat and not saying a word the entire trip there. And if we get caught, I don\u2019t know you.\u201d</p><p>Twenty minutes later I\u2019m unlocking the door to my dad\u2019s office and creeping inside in the dark with Paige clutching the back of my shirt.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make a sound,\u201d I whisper to her as I move slowly into the room and try to feel my way around. My shin connects with a chair and I let out a yelp.</p> <p>\u201cSHHHHHHHHH!\u201d Paige warns.</p><p>The pitch-black room is suddenly swathed in bright, fluorescent lighting as Lorelei flips the switch by the door.</p><p>\u201cIs there a reason why you two are lurking around in the dark like burglars? You have a key, Kennedy. It\u2019s not breaking and entering if you have a key.\u201d She walks past the two of us crouched low to the ground.</p><p>\u201cYou are totally killing my buzz,\u201d I inform her as I stand up fully and move away from Paige to the spare desks in the back of the room that my dad reserves for his part-time bounty hunters.</p><p>Glancing between the three of them, I spot Griffin\u2019s black leather jacket draped over the chair of the desk closest to the wall.</p> <p>\u201cThis is it. This is his desk,\u201d I tell the girls as I pull out the chair and have a seat.</p><p>\u201cOoooh, is this his jacket? It smells delicious. He wears yummy cologne,\u201d Paige sighs as she leans over and takes a big whiff of the coat.</p><p>\u201cFocus, Paige.\u201d</p><p>She moves around me and perches on the edge of the desk.</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly are we looking for? A to-do list with your name at the top of it? Kiss Kennedy\u2014check. Give her an orgasm in her father\u2019s bathroom\u2014check, check,\u201d Paige says as she riffles through the papers on top of the desk.</p><p>\u201cJust see if you can find any leads on McFadden. Something we don\u2019t have...I\u2019m guessing he has the same contacts I do, but you never know.\u201d I begin opening drawers and going through files while Lorelei flips through some phone messages next to the computer.</p> <p>After fifteen minutes of searching, we don\u2019t find squat. Leaning back in the chair, I kick the edge of the desk with my boot and curse loudly.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing here. This was a total bust,\u201d I complain.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what I expected to find here. Like Griffin would really leave something out that would lead us right to McFadden. If he had that information, he would be using it himself. And if this whole seduction thing he has going on with me is all a trick, I\u2019m pretty sure he wouldn\u2019t leave any evidence behind to confirm that fact. Once again, I\u2019m back to being irritated with all men.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a total bust,\u201d Paige tells me with a wag of her perfectly waxed eyebrows as she holds up a letter opener and a bottle of superglue.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you\u2019re thinking of doing, don\u2019t,\u201d Lorelei warns her as she tries to take the items out of Paige\u2019s hands.</p><p>Paige moves out of her reach and around to the front of the desk. \u201cSo we didn\u2019t find anything we can use against Griffin, no big deal. We can still fuck things up for him.\u201d</p><p>She gives me a sinister, calculating grin and suddenly, I remember why we\u2019re friends.</p><p>\u201cKennedy, do not stoop to that level. You\u2019re better than this,\u201d Lorelei pleads with me.</p> <p>It\u2019s a really nice statement for her to make, but I am not better than this. I\u2019m struggling with the fact that Griffin may have diddled me so I lose the bet. And I\u2019m losing my mind because during each of the times I\u2019ve been wrapped around him, all I\u2019ve been able to think about is how right it felt and how I couldn\u2019t imagine being anywhere else ever again.</p><p>Plus, I\u2019ve had about eleventy-four glasses of wine tonight and my decision-making skills aren\u2019t exactly up to par.</p><p>Reaching my hand out toward Paige, I join the dark side. \u201cI\u2019ll take the letter opener, you take the glue.\u201d</p><p>GD wine-addled brain.</p><p>CHAPTER 15</p><p>His palm slides up my bare thigh, pulls my leg back, and hitches it over his hip. I can feel every solid inch of his naked body against my back and I burrow closer to him until his erection is nestled against my ass.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve wanted you like this for eighteen years,\u201d he murmurs against the side of my neck before nibbling on my skin with his teeth.</p><p>I want to tell him not to say things like that, because it\u2019s totally going to kill the mood, but I can\u2019t find my voice when the tip of his penis slides against my opening.</p><p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s a total lie, right? I\u2019m just saying things like this to you so I can catch McFadden,\u201d he whispers as he slowly starts to push himself inside me.</p><p>I want to pull away and smack the grin right off his face that I know is there, but he feels too good between my legs and my body has suddenly lost its ability to move.</p><p>He teases me by pushing just a little bit inside me and then pulling right back out and I groan loudly in protest.</p><p>\u201cShhhh, it\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll make you feel good, gorgeous. I\u2019ll make you come until you can\u2019t remember your name and then leave you here in bed to go get McFadden. Because you know I\u2019ve known the entire time exactly where he is. I just wanted to see you race around trying to beat me. You\u2019ll never win. You should just accept that.\u201d</p><p>Alarms are going off in my head and I really should try harder to get out of this fucking bed, but he has a magical penis and I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s using voodoo on me. I can\u2019t move and I can\u2019t speak. I should be concerned with this. I should be screaming obscenities at him, but when I open my mouth, nothing comes out but another groan.</p><p>He starts to push in deeper and it feels so good that I don\u2019t care about anything but finally having him inside me. What is wrong with me? More alarms are going off and they sound like bells ringing. Where are the bells coming from? They get louder and louder as he continues to whisper taunts in my ear.</p><p>With all of the strength I can muster, I finally make my arm move and reach out to smack away whatever that ringing sound is. My hand clutches something small and as he pulls out of me and readies himself to slam his way back home, I find my voice and scream for all I\u2019m worth.</p><p>\u201cYOU SCUM-SUCKING RAT BASTARD ASSHOLE! I HOPE YOUR PENIS FALLS OFF!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, good morning to you too,\u201d Griffin says with a chuckle.</p><p>Blinking my eyes into focus, I bolt up in bed and frantically look around, realizing I\u2019m all alone with my cell phone up to my ear.</p><p>A dream? It was a fucking dream?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m the one who should be screaming curses at this point,\u201d he says through the phone line while I try to shake the dream from my head. \u201cAny idea how all of the keys on my computer got switched around and glued in the wrong place?\u201d</p><p>At least that part wasn\u2019t a dream.</p><p>\u201cOr maybe you know how two-hundred Post-it notes with pictures of penises drawn on them were glued to every inch of my desk,\u201d he deadpans.</p><p>Oops.</p><p>In my dream, I couldn\u2019t speak. Now that I\u2019m awake, I just don\u2019t want to. Yes, I know I behaved a little childishly last night, but it wasn\u2019t my fault. It was the wine\u2019s fault.</p><p>\u201cReally, it\u2019s no big deal that since I don\u2019t look at my fingers when I type, I sent out an e-mail to the state police that said \u2018gfpwq7 exclamation point asterisk\u2019 and my e-mail signature said \u2018Griffin Crawford, King of All Penises,\u2019\u201d he adds.</p><p>\u201cWell, it serves you right for not proofing your e-mails before you send them,\u201d I finally say.</p><p>I hear him sigh on the other end of the line and I almost feel a little bad about our drunken escapade last night.</p><p>\u201cKennedy?\u201d</p><p>When he says my name so soft and sweet I forget all about the bad dream I had.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d I reply quietly with a small smile on my face.</p><p>\u201cSleep with one eye open, babe. Game on.\u201d</p><p>I hear the silence of the ended call in my ear and for the first time in my life, I\u2019m dreading getting out of bed and going to work.</p><p>This is not going to end well.</p><p>I spent the next day and a half interviewing anyone and everyone McFadden ever knew, including all of his childhood friends. No one had seen or heard from him in months and they couldn\u2019t give me anything to go on as far as finding him. On top of that huge waste of time, I couldn\u2019t stop looking over my shoulder waiting for Griffin to jump out from behind a bush and taser me to get back at me for that little superglue stunt we pulled.</p><p>Walking into Fool Me Investigations with a jumbo-size hazelnut coffee in my hand, I\u2019m immediately assaulted by the sounds of phones ringing off the hook and Paige running back and forth between desks to answer them.</p><p>\u201cYes, I have your name and number and someone will call you back shortly. Yes, I wrote down that this is an emergency. Okay. Yes, we have a blonde that works here\u2014why does that matter?\u201d Paige asks into the phone as her pen pauses on the phone message pad. \u201cEeeeew, that\u2019s disgusting! What is wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>She slams the phone down and stalks over to me, clutching a stack of messages in her hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d I ask her as the phone she just hung up immediately starts to ring again and when I glance at the phone console on my desk, I see that all twelve lines are lit up and blinking angrily.</p><p>\u201cThis has been going on since I walked through the door an hour ago. People are calling for our services left and right. And let me tell you something, the things they are asking for are illegal in fifteen states,\u201d she tells me.</p><p>Grabbing the messages out of her hand, I skim through them and see that each and every one is asking for an immediate request to fix our back door.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell? Is our door broke? Are these all locksmiths?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Whenever I ask them they just laugh and tell me they want the special that\u2019s in the ad. Did you run an ad?\u201d</p><p>I did place an ad in the local newspaper that was going to start running this week, but it was for 10 percent off for first-time customers. This makes no sense.</p><p>\u201cSleep with one eye open, babe. Game on.\u201d</p><p>Griffin\u2019s parting words on the phone this morning run through my head.</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d I whisper as the door opens and I see my dad walk in with the morning paper in his hands.</p><p>\u201cKennedy, if you needed money, you could have come to me,\u201d he says.</p><p>I snatch the paper out of his hand and flip to the classifieds. Right smack in the middle of the page is fool me once in big, bold letters. Underneath are the words \u201cLooking for a good time?! Call Fool Me Once at 555-205-7201 for all of your escort needs. We have blondes, brunettes, and redheads. Make sure to ask about the Busted Back Door Special!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSON OF A BITCH!\u201d I shout as I crumble up the paper and throw it in the trash.</p><p>\u201cThe guys at the VFW all want to know if they can get a friends-and-family discount. Tell me the truth, Kennedy. Is this business a front for prostitution?\u201d my dad demands. \u201cAre you a hooker? And when did your back door get busted? Is that a euphemism for something?\u201d</p><p>Before I can set him straight, I feel my phone vibrate in my back pocket. Pulling it out, I see Griffin\u2019s name on the display and I growl into the phone when I answer it. \u201cYou are in big, big trouble.\u201d</p><p>He laughs through the line and I clench my teeth so hard I\u2019m afraid I might break a few off as I watch my dad waltz over to Lorelei\u2019s empty desk and answer one of the ringing lines.</p><p>\u201cYou want to pay how much? Wow. Let me get your name and number and get back to you,\u201d my dad tells the person on the other end of the line.</p><p>\u201cKennedy!\u201d he whisper-yells to me as he covers the mouthpiece with his hand. \u201cThis guy says he\u2019ll pay fifteen hundred dollars to bust your back door. I don\u2019t know why he\u2019d pay that much to break a door, but I\u2019m going to tell him you\u2019re game. We can always get it fixed later. I didn\u2019t realize prostitutes made so much money for weird stuff. I thought they just gave happy endings. I\u2019m in the wrong business. I should be a pimp.\u201d</p><p>I groan loudly at my dad as he goes back to his phone call.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Kennedy? I thought you would appreciate the fact that business is booming,\u201d Griffin says.</p><p>\u201cThis is NOT funny, Griffin.\u201d</p><p>He laughs again and it takes everything in me not to throw my phone against the wall.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re right. It\u2019s not funny,\u201d he tells me in a moment of seriousness. \u201cIt\u2019s HILARIOUS! Sorry, I don\u2019t have time to talk. Just got a tip on McFadden and I\u2019m pulling into the location he was spotted at. Talk to you soon. Go pick out something pretty to wear on our date. A dress would be perfect so I can stare at your gorgeous legs.\u201d</p><p>I hang up on him mid-laugh, walk over to my dad, snatch the phone away from his ear, and slam the receiver down.</p><p>\u201cHeeeey, I was just in the middle of negotiating you a higher price for this back-door thing,\u201d he complains.</p><p>\u201cPaige, get the state police on the line. Griffin e-mailed them this morning and now he\u2019s got a bead on McFadden. I need to find out where he is and get there ASAP,\u201d I tell her as I head for the door. \u201cDad, help Paige man the phones until Lorelei gets out of court. And for the love of all that is holy, stop making deals with these idiots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope when your back door gets busted and you make a bunch of cash you get in a better mood. You\u2019re too grumpy,\u201d my dad complains as I throw open the door and ignore Paige\u2019s hysterical laughter.</p><p>GD busting-back-door requests.</p><p>CHAPTER 16</p><p>It takes most of the day for Paige to finally get back to me on where Griffin is. Through her powers of persuasion, she found out that Griffin lied and he really wasn\u2019t about ready to nab McFadden when he called me earlier. He was just following a few leads and coming up empty, thank God. I really don\u2019t know how Paige did it, and I sort of don\u2019t want to know since it probably now involves free anal from one of us, but she was able to convince the police to send Griffin a text with the wrong address in it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Since he was currently working with them on leads, it wouldn\u2019t be weird that they\u2019d send him a text. When she called me with the news, all she told me was that when I got there, I should make sure to have my camera phone ready.</p><p>Pulling up to the Hyatt in Mishawaka, I call Paige as I make my way inside and step into the elevator.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure this is the right place? Why did you send him to a hotel?\u201d I ask her as I press the button for the third floor.</p> <p>\u201cOne of my friends from college is having her bachelorette party there tonight. I may have called and told her that a man, matching Griffin\u2019s description, would be knocking on the door claiming to be a bounty hunter, but he\u2019s really a stripper,\u201d she informs me. \u201cI also told her that no matter how much he denies it, she should just play along.\u201d</p><p>Oh no.</p><p>\u201cPaige, you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The elevator dings and the doors open up to the third floor and I can already hear screams and catcalls coming from a room at the end of the hall.</p><p>\u201cYou can thank me later. Take lots of pictures!\u201d</p> <p>I end the call and shove the phone into my pocket as the screaming and cheering gets louder and louder the closer I get to room 325. Taking a deep breath, I knock loudly on the door. It\u2019s immediately flung open and a woman wearing a tiara and a sash that reads bride to be greets me with a huge smile.</p><p>\u201cYaaaaay, another guest! You\u2019re just in time,\u201d she squeals as she grabs my arm and drags me into the room. All I see is a group of twenty or so drunk women huddled in a circle.</p><p>The bride-to-be shoves a few of the women aside and pulls me front and center of the circle and my mouth drops open when I see Griffin sitting in a hotel chair shirtless, with a pink feather boa draped around his neck, swatting away hands that are reaching for the button of his jeans.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, ladies, it\u2019s flattering that you think I\u2019m a stripper, but I really need to get back to work.\u201d He tries to get up from the chair and five women all huddle behind him, shoving him back down in his seat by pushing on his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWow, you guys are freakishly strong,\u201d he mutters as one of the girls gets down on her knees by his feet and starts untying his boot to the tune of Kid Rock\u2019s \u201cCowboy.\u201d</p><p>I really need to help him. It\u2019s all fun and games until some other woman tries to undress him. Watching them manhandle him is making me stabby. I\u2019m kind of struck dumb by the sight of him with his shirt off. He doesn\u2019t have a six-pack\u2014he has a ninety-five-pack. And when did he get a tattoo above his left pec? It\u2019s the United States Army insignia and I have the sudden urge to run my fingers over it. And then my tongue.</p> <p>\u201cUm, excuse me,\u201d I say loudly to the group at large.</p><p>No one hears me except for Griffin. He looks over the head of some woman wearing a headband with a giant plastic penis on it who is currently motorboating his crotch and raises his eyebrows at me.</p><p>I\u2019m not going to lie; I feel a little ashamed of my actions now that he\u2019s glaring at me. This whole payback idea was stellar after a few bottles of wine. Now that I\u2019m sober and the entire town thinks I\u2019m a call girl and the bachelorette party will most likely pass around Griffin\u2019s phone number to everyone they know to recommend his stripping services? Not so much.</p><p>\u201cLadies!\u201d I try again, shouting as loud as I can. A few of them turn to look at me and are none too happy that I took their attention away from the main event.</p><p>Raising my hands in a please-don\u2019t-kill me way, I try to reason with them.</p><p>\u201cSorry to interrupt, but this guy really isn\u2019t a stripper. It was a big misunderstanding. If you\u2019ll just let me get him out of here, you guys can go back to your partying,\u201d I explain to them.</p><p>\u201cIs this part of the show? I think we\u2019re supposed to just play along, isn\u2019t that what Paige told us?\u201d one of the girls whispers to someone behind me.</p><p>\u201cOoooooh, she\u2019s probably a stripper too! I\u2019ve never seen a female stripper!\u201d someone shouts from the other side of the room.</p> <p>I start shaking my head frantically back and forth when everyone\u2019s attention is suddenly on me, giving Griffin the opportunity to get up out of his chair untouched. He walks through the throng of women who are eyeing me up and down lecherously and I hold his arm, pulling him toward me for protection.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I swear to God, I had nothing to do with this. Help me get out of here with my clothes on and we\u2019ll call a truce,\u201d I whisper to him in a panic as a hand smacks my ass.</p><p>\u201cTAKE IT OFF, GIRLFRIEND!\u201d someone screams.</p><p>Griffin wraps one arm around my waist, pulls my body up against his naked torso, and stares down at me with a calculating grin.</p><p>\u201cSo now you want to call a truce. I don\u2019t think so, honey. I think you should do as the ladies say and take it off!\u201d he yells.</p><p>Twenty sets of arms go up in the air as they all start chanting. \u201cTake it off! Take it off! Take it off!\u201d</p><p>Aside from the fact that this is the most mortifying event in the history of my life, I can\u2019t help but enjoy the feel of Griffin\u2019s arm around me. I want to snuggle into the heat of his half-naked body. Even if he IS trying to throw me to the wolves.</p><p>As I smack random female hands away from the buttons of my formfitting, button-down black shirt, Griffin takes notice of the panicked look on my face and finally decides to come to my aid instead of instigating the drunk masses.</p><p>\u201cAll right, ladies, show\u2019s over. We really do need to get going,\u201d he shouts as he starts to walk backward through the crowd, pulling me along with him.</p><p>\u201cBut we want to see naked people!\u201d someone argues and the crowd starts to boo and glare at us.</p><p>Jesus, who knew drunken bachelorettes were so angry?</p><p>There\u2019s a knock at the door and Griffin turns away from me to open it as I hope and pray that it\u2019s hotel security. I have a feeling these bitches aren\u2019t going to let us out of here alive.</p><p>The door opens and my father stands there in the hotel hallway with one eyebrow raised questioningly.</p><p>\u201cPaige sent me. She said you might need my help,\u201d he tells Griffin as he takes in the scene behind us. Let\u2019s just say, I\u2019m pretty sure my father has never seen so many fake penis products in his entire life. The woman with the light-up penis earrings may just put him over the edge.</p><p>\u201cA SILVER FOX!\u201d the bride-to-be shouts when she sees my father.</p><p>I cover my ears and cringe as the screams of approval make it to new heights.</p><p>A group of screaming and giggling women shove Griffin and me out of the way, grab on to my dad\u2019s arm and drag him into the room. I don\u2019t feel the need to save my father because he\u2019s a hard-ass. There\u2019s no way he\u2019ll let this go on for much longer; he won\u2019t have the patience for it.</p><p>The women are fawning all over him at this point, running their hands through his hair and kissing his cheeks. Any second now he\u2019s going to yell at all of them to back the fuck up.</p><p>Any second now...</p><p>\u201cNo, there must be some confusion. That\u2019s my daughter and she\u2019s not a stripper,\u201d my dad tells them with a stern look as they start asking him questions about his \u201cstripper partners.\u201d</p><p>I sigh in relief that this will all be over soon and we can get the hell out of here.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m serious. She\u2019s not a stripper. She\u2019s a hooker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh dear God,\u201d I mutter as they push my dad into the chair Griffin recently vacated and one woman straddles his lap.</p><p>I can\u2019t look. This is just...Oh my God...I\u2019m going to puke.</p><p>\u201cGriffin! Do something!\u201d I scold him as I point angrily in my dad\u2019s direction while he looks up happily at the woman giving him a lap dance.</p><p>\u201cHey, Buddy! You need some help over there?\u201d Griffin yells across the room to my dad.</p><p>\u201cNope. I got it under control. You two run along now. Go do some talking or something. Or better yet, go bust Kennedy\u2019s back door and pay her for it so she gets in a better mood,\u201d he yells back.</p><p>Griffin salutes my dad with a chuckle, grabs my hand, and pulls me out of the room. The door closes behind us just as a cheer erupts from inside and I can only imagine what is currently being done to my father.</p><p>GD drunk bachelorettes.</p><p>CHAPTER 17</p><p>All I know is, he didn\u2019t come home until three in the morning and he fell asleep with a huge-ass grin on his face. And I\u2019m pretty sure I saw stripper glitter sparkling in his hair when the light hit it. What the hell happened?\u201d my brother Bobby asks Ted as he loads a round of bullets into his service pistol and takes aim at the paper target ten yards away.</p><p>I walk up behind them at the tail end of their conversation and try not to think about what could have put such a big smile on my dad\u2019s face the previous night after Griffin and I left the hotel.</p><p>Every week since Bobby moved back in with my dad, the three of us meet at the indoor shooting range and throw out career ideas to him. It looks like this week Bobby\u2019s future is not going to be the main topic of discussion.</p><p>I clear my throat softly behind them so as not to startle them\u2014never a good idea with people holding loaded weapons. Ted turns around, puts his gun on the ledge, and immediately wraps his arm around my neck and tugs me into a headlock, rubbing his knuckles against my scalp.</p><p>\u201cWhat up, sis? Ready to get your ass kicked today?\u201d Ted says with a laugh as I punch my fists into his side until he finally lets me go.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Ted, grow up,\u201d I complain as I stand back up and rub my sore head. We both stand silently in the lane at the indoor shooting range and watch Bobby fire off a few rounds, all but two hitting the center target.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s new with you? Aside from the fact that you\u2019re now a prostitute and Dad has decided to open a strip club?\u201d Bobby asks as he steps back out of the lane and gestures for Ted to go next.</p><p>\u201cFunny,\u201d I tell him with a smack to his upper arm. \u201cI\u2019m still trying to catch this fucking bail jumper while attempting NOT to strangle Griffin in the process.\u201d</p><p>Ted takes aim and unloads his clip into the target. Buddy laughs when half of them go wild and pierce the outer circle of the target.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch! Something must be wrong with this gun. Here, you do something with it.\u201d Ted steps back and I reach my hand out for it.</p><p>\u201cGo easy on Griffin. He\u2019s good people,\u201d Ted tells me and I load the clip with more rounds.</p><p>With a roll of my eyes, I lift my arms up, take a deep breath, and begin firing when I exhale. All but one bullet hits the center target.</p><p>\u201cOoooh, I do believe that makes me the winner,\u201d I gloat.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand how you always beat us when WE taught you how to shoot,\u201d Buddy grumbles.</p><p>\u201cOh, I almost forgot. I got some information about your guy, McFadden,\u201d Ted tells me as he pulls a folded-up piece of paper out of his back pocket.</p><p>Taking it from his hand and putting the gun down on the ledge, I scan the information.</p><p>\u201cBack when he was a teenager, he got popped for marijuana possession. The file was sealed because he was a minor at the time, but luckily, I know people,\u201d he informs me as Bobby steps up behind me and reads over my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHe took the rap for some guy named Steven Lawson. They grew up together in the same neighborhood and were best friends,\u201d Bobby reads aloud.</p><p>\u201cWe already got this information and looked into the name Steven Lawson to question him and there weren\u2019t any hits on him. I questioned the friends of his I could find, but Steven Lawson didn\u2019t have a current address listed and none of the old friends remembered that name. What does this have to do with anything now?\u201d I ask Ted as I look up from the paper.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky I went on a date with one of the file clerks at the courthouse and completely blew her mind last week,\u201d Ted tells us with an arrogant grin.</p><p>\u201cShut up and get to the point,\u201d I warn him.</p><p>\u201cFine. Buzzkill. Steven Lawson changed his name after he got out of juvie. He now goes by the name Sven Mendleson.\u201d</p><p>My mouth drops open and my arm automatically reaches out and punches Ted in the arm. \u201cShut the fuck up. Are you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOwww,\u201d Ted complains as he rubs the spot on his arm. \u201cSerious as a heart attack, dude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m confused. Who the hell is Sven Mendleson?\u201d Bobby asks as he takes the paper out of my hands and reads through it again.</p><p>\u201cI asked Ward about Sven. He\u2019s some annoying guy who does shit to Kennedy\u2019s hair and wouldn\u2019t shut up about the fact that when McFadden showed up at his salon, he put his life on the line trying to apprehend him,\u201d Ted explains with a roll of his eyes. \u201cWard\u2019s pissed now that he knows Steven and Sven are the same person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat rat bastard. He let McFadden get away on purpose. I\u2019m going to kick his ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlow down there, rough rider. If Sven Mendleson is Steven Lawson, you need to tread lightly. This guy isn\u2019t someone you mess with. He\u2019s kind of a big deal in the pot world,\u201d Ted warns.</p><p>\u201cSeriously? You have got to be kidding me. There is no way that little asshole with the fake accent is a big deal in anything. He\u2019s probably been hiding McFadden all this time. Son of a bitch, I\u2019m going to kill him!\u201d</p><p>I start pacing back and forth in the small booth with thoughts of homicide by hair dye swirling through my brain.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you, Kennedy, do NOT go into this alone. Now that the police are aware of the connection between Sven and Steven, they are taking control. You agree to let the police handle this or I go to Griffin and make him hold you hostage until it\u2019s settled. I only gave you this information so that you\u2019d stop with all the wild-goose chases,\u201d Ted warns me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cKennedy might actually like being held hostage by Griffin,\u201d Bobby says with a laugh, which earns him his very own punch in the arm.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the deal with Griffin? Are you guys dating or what?\u201d Ted presses the button to bring the paper target forward. \u201cAnd more importantly, are you going to be charging him by the hour or by the orgasm?\u201d</p><p>They both start laughing like idiots and I cross my arms in front of me and glare at them.</p> <p>\u201cNo! We are not dating, nor will we EVER be dating.\u201d</p><p>Ted unhooks the target from the clips and sets it aside before attaching a new, clean one and hitting the button to send it back.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your problem with him? He\u2019s a good guy and he roots for Notre Dame. What more could you ask for?\u201d Buddy demands.</p><p>\u201cHe kind of told me he\u2019s had a thing for me for eighteen years. Which I know is a total lie and he just did that to throw me off so he could get to McFadden first,\u201d I complain.</p><p>Both of the boys are silent for so long after I say this that an uneasy feeling creeps over me. They are never this quiet. Ever.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask, looking back and forth between them.</p><p>\u201cNothing, it\u2019s nothing,\u201d Ted says as he picks up the pistol and busies himself loading it.</p><p>I walk up and snatch the gun out of his hand and smack it back down on the ledge.</p><p>\u201cSpeak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRuff!\u201d Bobby pipes up from behind me.</p><p>Without taking my eyes off Ted, I reach back and smack Bobby in the stomach, feeling satisfied when he lets out a painful oof.</p> <p>Ted has always been the easiest one to break. Even when we were little and he was eight and I was four. All I had to do was glare at him and he would sing like a canary. Narrowing my eyes and putting my hands on my hips, it only takes a few seconds before Ted bursts.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand how in all these years you never noticed that he TOTALLY has a thing for you. He\u2019s been in love with you since high school and only joined the army because you did and he wanted to make sure you were safe and then made sure to live close enough to you to keep an eye on you. Haven\u2019t you ever wondered why he never got married himself? YOU\u2019RE his dream girl, not stupid Megan Fox. Alex is such an asshole that he might have just married you so Griffin couldn\u2019t have you.\u201d</p><p>Ted finally shuts up and lets out a huge sigh of relief at having unloaded a huge pile of shit right at my feet that I have no idea what to do with. This cannot really be happening right now.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Ted. When did you grow ovaries?\u201d Bobby complains with a sad shake of his head.</p><p>\u201cWhew, that felt good. That\u2019s been like a brick on my chest for years,\u201d Ted says.</p><p>A smile. Like it\u2019s no big deal. I don\u2019t even know which part of that confession to process first. Could it be possible that Alex only married me so Griffin couldn\u2019t? Thinking back over our marriage and all of the ups and downs, mostly downs, it could very well be true. And if Griffin really was in love with me, why the hell didn\u2019t he ever say anything sooner? I mean seriously? Aside from my daughters, whom I wouldn\u2019t trade for the world, there is nothing else even remotely memorable about my marriage to Alex.</p><p>\u201cThis is BULLSHIT!\u201d I finally yell with a stomp of my foot. \u201cHe had plenty of time to make his move. Prom. FUCKING PROM! I had a crush on him. I was thinking about dumping Alex for him. We were going to go to prom together and everything would have been beautiful, but he ditched me and I married Alex!\u201d</p><p>Bobby cocks his head at me. \u201cWasn\u2019t that like, twenty years ago? Who cares about prom? Let it go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet it go?! LET IT GO?! I CARE ABOUT PROM! There is no statute of limitations on being angry about getting ditched two days before prom,\u201d I argue indignantly.</p><p>Don\u2019t judge me. I don\u2019t care if it was eighty years ago. I had bought a dress and matching shoes. A DRESS. I was going to wear a fucking dress for him and most likely give him my virginity. I\u2019m allowed to be angry about that for as long as I want. Plus, being angry about prom helps me to not think about the fact that he\u2019s been carrying a torch around for me all of these years and never said anything.</p><p>Why the hell would anyone have a thing for me that long? I\u2019m nothing special. I\u2019m just me. Griffin is gorgeous, funny, sweet, helpful, a good listener, a great friend, beats up my ex-husband for me, and loves my girls unconditionally. He even puts up with my insane family. I love that about him. I love everything about him, even his stupid, cocky attitude.</p><p>Son of a bitch!</p><p>All thoughts of Steven Lawson/Sven Mendleson fly from my mind. When in the hell did I fall in love with Griffin Crawford??</p><p>GD Griffin Crawford!</p><p>CHAPTER 18</p><p>Sitting all alone in the dark on the floor of Fool Me Once at midnight on a Wednesday should tell you just how fantastic I\u2019m doing right now. As soon as I left the shooting range, I sent a text to Alex and told him he was keeping the girls for a few more days because I had work to do.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t completely a lie. I did have work to do. But I also had thoughts to think. Lots of thoughts. Important thoughts. Thoughts that couldn\u2019t be thunk with a twelve-year-old complaining that I\u2019m the worst mom in the world and a nine-year-old begging me to send her to military school.</p><p>It\u2019s not their fault their father is an asshole. They deserve a man in their lives who will put them first. Griffin would put them first. Griffin does put them first. He also manages to somehow put me first as well. How could I have been so blind?</p><p>As I continue to beat myself up, my thoughts are interrupted by a soft knock on the glass door to the building. Pushing myself up off the floor, I rest my hand on the butt of the gun in my holster as I head toward the door and wonder who the hell would be knocking this late at night. I stop in my tracks when I look up and see Griffin standing on the other side of the glass.</p><p>How the hell did he even know I was here?</p><p>The streetlight on the sidewalk shines down on him and I cover the remaining distance to the door in a trance, my eyes never leaving his. He stares down at me as I reach up and turn the deadbolt on the door and push it open for him. I take a few steps back to give him room to come in and he relocks the door without looking away from me.</p><p>Why did I never see this before? Why did I never notice the way he looks at me: like I\u2019m the most important person in his world? Why did I never appreciate him and love him like he deserved?</p><p>\u201cI drove by your house but didn\u2019t see your car. Took a chance that you\u2019d be here.\u201d</p><p>He opens his mouth to say something else and I quickly reach my hand up and place it over his lips. His eyes soften as he looks down at me.</p><p>\u201cNo more talking. Not right now,\u201d I whisper to him.</p><p>Right now I don\u2019t want to argue with him and I don\u2019t want to hash out all of the details. I just want to feel.</p><p>Griffin nods his head in agreement and I drop my hand.</p><p>Come tomorrow, I am most likely going to do something really, really stupid. Something I swore to Ted that I would let the police handle. Tonight, I want to do something smart.</p><p>Standing up on my tiptoes, I wrap my arms around his neck and pull his head down to mine. When our lips connect, I can\u2019t help but sigh in relief. It feels like forever since I kissed him last and I don\u2019t even care that I\u2019m thinking like a sappy, lovesick girl right now. I am a sappy, lovesick girl.</p><p>Griffin\u2019s hands grab onto my hips and he effortlessly lifts me up against him. I wrap my legs tightly around his waist as he begins walking us through the office.</p><p>I move away from his mouth to pull my shirt up and off my body, flinging it into the middle of the room before fusing my lips to his, our tongues tangling immediately. My back is suddenly slammed against a wall and I don\u2019t even care when I hear a painting fall off and crash to the floor. Griffin leaves me leaning against the wall and sinks down onto his knees in front of me, pushing my jeans, along with my underwear, down to my ankles in one rough yank.</p><p>I have just enough time to pull my feet out of my jeans and clutch his hair before his mouth is on me. There\u2019s nothing slow and gentle about the way he delves between my legs and that\u2019s perfectly fine with me. He devours me with his lips, tongue, and fingers all at once, everywhere. With each swipe of his tongue and swirl of his fingers I\u2019m pushed closer and closer into a mindless ball of need. My hips thrust frantically against him as I hold his head in place, aching to reach my release that throbs so close.</p><p>With his lips firmly attached to my clit and a thrust of two of his fingers inside me, I explode fast and hard around him, letting my head thump back against the wall while I shout his name. As my orgasm ebbs and flows out of me, his tongue leisurely slides against me until I\u2019m spent. I let go of the death grip I have on his hair and he kisses his way up my body until he\u2019s standing before me.</p><p>I love this man. And not just because he gave me yet another mind-blowing orgasm. I love him because he\u2019s Griffin.</p><p>Grabbing on to the hem of his shirt, I yank it up and over his head, dropping it by our feet before quickly unsnapping his jeans. Reaching my hand inside his pants, I palm his thick erection.</p><p>\u201cFuck, Kennedy,\u201d he groans as he leans his body into mine and buries his head against my neck. I slide my hand up and down his smooth length, firm and slow. \u201cWe need to stop. I am not taking you up against a wall. A bed. We need a bed.\u201d</p><p>His voice is broken and filled with need and it\u2019s the hottest sound I\u2019ve ever heard. Squeezing him tighter and moving my hand faster, I distract him long enough to reach down with my other hand and push his jeans far enough down his hips so that his cock is no longer constricted.</p><p>\u201cFuck the bed. We can do that later,\u201d I tell him as I hitch one leg around his hip and use my thigh muscles to pull him in closer.</p><p>I move my hand out of the way as his erection slides against me. One of his arms wraps around my waist and holds me tightly and the other hand smacks against the wall by my head to brace himself. We both let out a groan and he drops his forehead against mine, holding it there while he pushes and pulls his length through my wetness.</p><p>\u201cI know you said no talking, and that\u2019s fine. You don\u2019t have to talk. In fact, I don\u2019t want you to say anything,\u201d he tells me as he slides the head of his cock back and forth over my sensitive clit. \u201cBut you need to know, right here, right now, that I love you, Kennedy O\u2019Brien. I have always loved you.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a good thing he told me not to speak because I couldn\u2019t say anything right now if I wanted to. I can feel my eyes welling up with tears and I try to blink them away as I stare up at him. Without saying a word, I move my hands up to either side of his face and pull him against my mouth. I tell him everything I can\u2019t say out loud with my lips and tongue. I pour everything into this kiss and I hope to God he knows and can feel it. I moan into his mouth when he pulls his hips back slightly and then slowly pushes himself inside me. The dream I had about this moment the other night pales in comparison to the real thing.</p><p>He\u2019s thick and full inside me, his body is pressed up against me, and his hands move slowly over every inch of me that he can reach. I feel him everywhere and when he begins plunging in and out of me, I match his movements thrust for thrust until he\u2019s pounding into me at a feverish pace. We\u2019re slamming against the wall so hard that I\u2019m waiting to feel myself crash through the drywall at any minute. I don\u2019t care if we tear this wall down or the entire building comes crashing down around us.</p><p>Another orgasm barrels through me at a shocking speed, this one just as explosive as the first one. I try to move my mouth away from Griffin\u2019s so I can scream and moan my satisfaction, but he keeps his lips pressed to mine and swallows my cries. His tongue pushes slow and deep into my mouth as each wave of my release washes through me. Within seconds he slams into me one last time and holds himself still as he quickly follows me with his own orgasm. It\u2019s my turn to hold his lips against mine as he moans into my mouth and pulses inside of me. He rocks his hips against me slowly until his body sags against mine and he pulls his mouth away so we can both breathe heavily.</p><p>I rest my cheek on his shoulder and hold him as tightly to me as possible while I catch my breath and he presses several kisses to the top of my head.</p><p>After a few minutes, he pulls out of me, scoops me up into his arm, and carries me into the back room, where there\u2019s a very roomy couch that is in desperate need of being broken in.</p><p>No more words are exchanged between us for the rest of the night. We might not have a bed like Griffin wanted, but that couch definitely served us well.</p><p>It served us well four more times before we both passed out.</p><p>GD man and his stamina.</p><p>CHAPTER 19</p><p>I\u2019m a coward.</p><p>Go ahead and say it. I already know it\u2019s true, so you may as well validate me. I got dressed and left the office at the crack of dawn. I snuck out of there with Griffin still naked and asleep on the couch.</p><p>I know I shouldn\u2019t have done it. I know I should have woken him up and told him I love him. Hell, I should have told him last night before we had sex the third or fourth time. I\u2019m stubborn and pigheaded and fiercely independent. Griffin already knows this about me so when he wakes up and finds me gone, he shouldn\u2019t be too surprised.</p><p>All of this dating nonsense revolved around a bet. A stupidly sweet bet that Griffin came up with as a way to get back into my life, but still. A bet\u2019s a bet and I do not lose bets. Plus, if I\u2019m going to date anyone, it\u2019s going to be because I choose to do it and not because I had to do it to hold up my end of the bargain.</p><p>In the wee hours of the morning, when I can still feel the scratch of Griffin\u2019s five o\u2019clock shadow between my thighs and every muscle in my body aches deliciously from overuse, I am pulling into the driveway of a farmhouse in the middle of bum-fuck nowhere. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>According to the printout Ted gave me yesterday, this sprawling ten-acre farm surrounded by cornfields on all sides is owned by our very own man of the hour: Sven Mendleson. AKA Steve Lawson. AKA lying sack of shit, bail-jumper-hiding, drug-dealing thorn in my side.</p><p>Pulling up right in front of the huge wraparound porch, I put my Explorer in park, turn off the engine, and step out onto the gravel drive. I don\u2019t see any other cars anywhere and while this should put me a little bit at ease that the place isn\u2019t crawling with twitchy potheads and dealers picking up their stash, it leaves me feeling just a tiny bit uneasy. As I slowly make my way up the steps, I double-check my gun to make sure it\u2019s fully loaded before sliding it into my holster. Taking a deep breath, I reach up and knock on the door, keeping one hand resting on the butt of my gun just in case.</p><p>I don\u2019t hear any noise on the other side of the door, and I take a moment while I wait to look around the yard and keep an eye out for any movement. Not seeing anything of concern, I reach back up to knock again when the door is opened before my knuckles can make contact with the wood.</p> <p>\u201c\u2019Sup,\u201d the twentysomething guy in front of me says with a jerk of his chin.</p><p>As I take in his blue Cookie Monster T-shirt, ratty jeans, fuzzy yellow duck slippers, and open bag of Cheetos, I quickly decide this guy is most likely not going to be a threat to me. And going by his bloodshot eyes that he can barely keep focused on me, I\u2019m going to guess the only threat he could possibly pose would be secondhand smoke.</p><p>\u201cHi, my name\u2019s Kennedy and I\u2019m looking for Martin McFadden. Have you seen him?\u201d</p><p>He stares at me while he reaches one hand into his bag of Cheetos and brings one up to his mouth, crunching slowly.</p><p>\u201cWeird old dude who believes in aliens, about this tall?\u201d he asks, holding his hand up to his chin.</p> <p>\u201cYep, that\u2019s him,\u201d I reply with an excited nod of my head.</p><p>\u201cNope, never heard of him,\u201d he tells me, shoveling a handful of Cheetos in his mouth.</p><p>Oh, for the love of God.</p><p>\u201cLook, I don\u2019t really care what\u2019s going on here\u2014I just want McFadden. Tell me where he is, I will take him with me quietly, and you can go back to eating your way through the junk-food aisle of the grocery store,\u201d I plead with him.</p><p>\u201cSteve will be really pissed if I talk. I wish I had some Peanut Butter Cap\u2019n Crunch right now.\u201d He stares dejectedly into his bag of Cheetos.</p><p>\u201cI promise, Steve won\u2019t be pissed. And I will buy you twenty boxes of Peanut Butter Cap\u2019n Crunch if you take me to McFadden.\u201d</p> <p>I find it hard to believe the Steve/Sven I know could seriously get pissed about anything unless it has to do with bad hair, but I\u2019m not about to tell this guy that.</p><p>\u201cPeanut butter is delicious. Captain is crunchy. Crunchy is a funny word. I think Martin is in the snack making a kitchen,\u201d he tells me with a nod toward the back of the house.</p><p>Good lord, this guy needs to be the poster boy for why kids should stay off drugs.</p><p>Taking a step past him and into the living room while he stands there licking the Day-Glo orange cheese off his fingers, I hear the unmistakable sound of a gun being cocked and I stop in my tracks.</p><p>\u201cTake your gun out of its holster and toss it onto the couch, slowly.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s Sven, without the accent. I slowly turn around with my hands in the air and see him standing at the opening of the hallway with a .44 Magnum aimed right at my head. Holding that gun at me, he no longer looks like a hairdresser with a poodle named Mrs. Justin Bieber. Right now he looks like he would shoot me between the eyes without even blinking.</p><p>With one hand still up in the air, I slowly reach down with my other hand and gradually pull my gun out of its holster and do as he says, tossing it onto the couch cushions.</p><p>\u201cNow, toss me your car keys,\u201d he demands.</p> <p>Have I mentioned yet how stupid an idea this was coming here alone?</p><p>Sliding my hand into my front pocket, I pull my keys out and chuck them at him. He easily catches them with the hand not holding the gun and puts them in his own pocket.</p><p>\u201cHey, Stevie, are we all out of mayo? I looked in the pantry and I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>McFadden walks into the room with Tinkerdoodle under his arm and stops speaking as soon as he sees the scene in front of him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Oh my gosh, don\u2019t shoot her!\u201d McFadden wails as he looks back and forth between me and the gun pointed at my face.</p><p>\u201cLook Sven, Steve, whatever your name is, I don\u2019t want any trouble. I could care less what\u2019s going on here. I have a cousin who smokes pot for his glaucoma. Great stuff, excellent results. I just want to take McFadden in nice and peacefully so the bondsman can get his money back,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Stevie won\u2019t hurt you, will you, Stevie? I\u2019m finished with my life of crime. I\u2019ve learned my lesson. The life of a thug is no life for me,\u201d McFadden says wearily as he starts to walk toward me.</p><p>Before he can even make it a few steps in my direction, Steve quickly reaches out and grabs hold of McFadden\u2019s arm, yanking him back so hard that he drops Tinkerdoodle to the floor. Steve keeps McFadden close to him and brings the gun up, pressing it right against McFadden\u2019s temple.</p><p>\u201cSTEVIE! What are you doing?! Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God,\u201d McFadden cries hysterically.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna go take a nap,\u201d the pothead over by the door suddenly announces before shuffling off down the hall in his duck slippers.</p><p>\u201cI knew letting you hide out here would be a bad idea. Now the fucking cops are going to be swarming this place. Do you have any idea how much product I\u2019m going to lose when they storm in here? How many millions of dollars are going to go right down the drain because you\u2019re a fuckup?\u201d Steve yells angrily.</p><p>\u201cStevie, don\u2019t say things like that! I thought we were friends!\u201d McFadden cries.</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up. We were never friends; I just tolerated you so you\u2019d take the fall for me back in high school. And now look where that got me. A fucking cop here in my living room and thousands of pounds of weed in my basement,\u201d he growls, gesturing toward me with his gun.</p><p>I need to get McFadden away from this lunatic and get out of this house. How the hell am I going to do that without a gun?</p><p>Tinkerdoodle lets out a small little yip when her stares at McFadden go ignored and a thought pops into my head. It\u2019s not the brightest idea in the world, but I\u2019m obviously not very full of bright ideas today, now, am I?</p><p>I\u2019m hoping McFadden is pissed off enough at finding out our boy Steve here was never really his friend and he\u2019ll play along. Otherwise, we\u2019re all screwed.</p><p>\u201cHey, McFadden. Remember that day we hung out at the tailgating party and you made me a hamburger?\u201d I ask him, staring pointedly down at Tinkerdoodle.</p><p>Come on, get the hint. Get the hint.</p><p>\u201cRemember how sweet and loving Tinkerdoodle was with me before you left?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m starting to lose my faith in this guy and Steve is beginning to look suspicious when I see the lightbulb go on in McFadden\u2019s brain.</p><p>I give him the tiniest of nods. He swallows thickly, squeezes his eyes closed, and screams, \u201cTINKERDOODLE! ATTACK!\u201d</p><p>Just like on tailgating day, Tinkerdoodle jumps to action in a blur of fur, snapping teeth, yapping barks, and flying spit as she charges at Steve\u2019s leg and clamps down on his ankle.</p><p>\u201cSON OF A BITCH!\u201d Steve screams in pain as he shoves McFadden away and tries to get the dog off his leg.</p><p>The pitter-patter of dog toenails echoes around us as Mrs. Justin Bieber flies into the living room to get in on the action. Luckily, she\u2019s decided to be a joiner, chomping her teeth down on Steve\u2019s other leg.</p><p>Without hesitation, I lunge forward, grab McFadden\u2019s arm, and drag him behind me as fast as I can toward the front door while both dogs bite down harder on Steve\u2019s leg and he shouts and flails around the living room trying to dislodge them.</p><p>We stumble out the front door and down the steps when it hits me that I don\u2019t have my keys and have no way to escape. I don\u2019t have time to worry about that right now though, because it won\u2019t be long before Steve comes racing out here after us, guns a-blazing.</p><p>Yanking McFadden in front of me, I shove him as hard as I can and scream at him to run.</p><p>\u201cGO! Into the corn! Don\u2019t stop until I tell you!\u201d</p><p>We sprint full speed the ten yards or so across the grass until we burst into the first row of corn, smacking stalks out of our way as we go and hearing the first sounds of a gun being fired in our direction.</p><p>I\u2019m too busy running and looking over my shoulder to notice McFadden stop suddenly and I slam into the back of him, both of us stumbling forward.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell? Why are you stopping? KEEP GOING!\u201d I yell at him as another shot echoes behind us, this one closer than the last.</p><p>\u201cA crop circle,\u201d he whispers in wonder. \u201cOh my God, they\u2019ve been here. They\u2019ll save us!\u201d</p><p>Looking around him in irritation, I see a huge, matted-down area of cornstalks directly in front of us.</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, get your shit together, man! We need to get the hell out of here!\u201d</p><p>The hard, cold steel of the nose of a gun presses roughly into the back of my head and I realize we\u2019ve just lost our chance at escaping.</p><p>GD crop circle.</p><p>CHAPTER 20</p><p>Will you stop crying? Goddammit, you\u2019re giving me a headache,\u201d Steve complains to McFadden.</p><p>I have an unnatural urge to reach out and smack Steve upside the head. However, this wouldn\u2019t be a wise idea since he currently still has a gun aimed at me.</p><p>\u201cJust tell me Tinkerdoodle is still alive!\u201d McFadden sobs as he stands next to me in the middle of the \u201ccrop circle\u201d where Steve forced us to walk.</p><p>Oh, don\u2019t worry about me with a GUN TO MY HEAD. The dog that you stole is perfectly fine, thank you very much.</p><p>\u201cHey, dude. I heard some shots. You need my help or something?\u201d</p><p>Pothead waltzes into our little party with a gun in his hand, using the tip of it to scratch his head.</p><p>This just keeps getting better and better.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about fucking time you got here. Keep an eye on Martin; this one\u2019s all mine,\u201d Steve says as he wraps his fingers tightly around my upper arm and digs the gun back into the side of my head.</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t just forget about Martin and go on your merry way. You had to keep digging, didn\u2019t you? Now you\u2019re both going to die,\u201d Steve threatens.</p><p>McFadden begins wailing embarrassingly loud and Steve and I both groan in annoyance. At least we\u2019re in agreement on something: McFadden is irritating. But not so much that he needs to be shot in the middle of a cornfield.</p><p>\u201cLook, how about you just let him go and deal with me?\u201d I ask him, trying to plead with the tiniest bit of humanity I hope he still has left in him.</p><p>\u201cSorry, no can do. I don\u2019t trust either of you. You\u2019re each getting a bullet to the brain.\u201d</p><p>Okay, maybe not. On to Plan B.</p><p>Except I don\u2019t have a Plan B. I\u2019m pretty sure I didn\u2019t even have a Plan A.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that will be necessary, Steve.\u201d</p><p>Pure elation and downright dread fight in the pit of my stomach when I hear the sound of Griffin\u2019s voice and the click of a gun that I\u2019m pretty sure he has aimed at Steve\u2019s head right at this moment.</p><p>I\u2019m so happy he\u2019s here that I want jump up and down and point and laugh in Steve\u2019s face. But I\u2019m also scared to death that he\u2019s here right now. What if he gets hurt? Griffin can\u2019t get hurt just because of me. Especially when he doesn\u2019t even know I love him.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do, hotshot? Shoot both of us? In case you haven\u2019t noticed, there are two of us with guns and only one of you,\u201d Steve taunts Griffin.</p><p>We all turn at the same time and look at the pothead standing on the other side of me, swaying back and forth, twirling his gun through the air like he\u2019s writing his name with a Fourth of July sparkler.</p><p>\u201cOh, for fuck\u2019s sake, Gunnar, FOCUS!\u201d Steve yells at him.</p><p>Gunnar? Note to self: Never name any future children that I may or may not have Gunnar. They will indeed be brainless twits.</p><p>Gunnar jumps into action, sort of, and stands at attention with his gun held up to his forehead and his chest puffed out.</p><p>As soon as I look away from him, I feel Steve remove the gun from the back of my head and in a flash, he twists around and pistol-whips Griffin against the side of his face, taking him by surprise. I watch as Griffin\u2019s gun goes flying through the air and he stumbles backward a few steps. He gains his footing and shakes the cobwebs from his head. With a growl, he ducks his head and charges right at Steve, tackling him to the ground like a linebacker.</p><p>McFadden stands in the middle of the clearing flapping his arms wildly and screaming as he jumps up and down in place like a six-year-old girl throwing a fit in the toy store.</p><p>While Gunnar is distracted by Steve and Griffin\u2019s scuffle and McFadden losing his ever-loving mind, I take that moment to pull my arm back and throw an uppercut. His eyes roll into the back of his head as soon as my fist makes contact and he crumbles to the ground at my feet.</p><p>I turn around with a satisfied look on my face when I see Steve kick both of his feet into Griffin\u2019s chest and send him soaring backward, knocking the wind out of him when he lands. While Griffin groans and tries to catch his breath, Steve rolls over and grabs one of the fallen guns, jumps up with blood dripping from his mouth and nose and aims the gun at me.</p><p>Pulling the slide back to load the first bullet into the chamber, he winks at me while I watch his finger tighten on the trigger. There\u2019s nothing I can do at this point but squeeze my eyes closed and brace myself for the pain. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I hear a loud yell of protest and fear that comes from Griffin, along with the unmistakable sound of the gun going off. What feels like a brick wall crashes into the side of me and I\u2019m slammed down roughly into the dirt and broken cornstalks. I can\u2019t breathe with the heavy weight on top of me and all I can think about is that being shot hurts a whole fucking lot more than I thought it would.</p><p>Another shot goes off and it makes me flinch and finally open my eyes. When I don\u2019t see a white light or any golden gates, I realize I\u2019m not dead. I\u2019m flat on the ground with Griffin on top of me.</p><p>\u201cOH MY GOD, I SHOT HIM! Oh no, I\u2019m going to puke. It\u2019s happening. Right now. I\u2019m going to be sick,\u201d McFadden yells as he bends over at the waist and dry-heaves next to a screaming Steve who holds on to the bloody mess of what\u2019s left of the hand McFadden shot off.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay? Are you hurt?\u201d Griffin asks in a panic as he takes some of his weight off me and runs his hands over every inch of me, checking for bullet holes.</p> <p>\u201cJesus, that just took ten years off my life,\u201d he whispers in my ear as he pulls me against him and I bury my face in his neck.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, does no one even care that I\u2019m throwing up over here? I need a cold washrag and some 7 Up,\u201d McFadden complains through his heaves.</p><p>As good as it feels to be wrapped in Griffin\u2019s arms, knowing that we\u2019re both safe and sound, there\u2019s something I need to do before this goes any further. With a sigh, I gently push Griffin off me and ignore the questioning look on his face as I get up and walk over to McFadden.</p><p>Patting him on the back with one hand as he gags, I reach into my back pocket with my other hand and pull out my zip ties. While he\u2019s busy retching, I pull his arms behind his back and secure them together with the pieces of plastic.</p><p>\u201cI saved your life and this is the thanks I get?\u201d McFadden complains as he stands up and struggles to move his arms.</p> <p>I refrain from responding to him, on the grounds that it may result in me murdering him in cold blood in the middle of his precious crop circle. Instead, I leave him there to complain and walk back over to Griffin.</p><p>\u201cSo, I guess this means you won the bet. You don\u2019t have to go on a date with me now,\u201d he tells me with a cocky grin.</p><p>I smile sweetly right back at him. And then I punch him square in the jaw.</p><p>Satisfied that this stupid bet can stop looming over my head, I grab on to the front of his shirt, quickly haul him to me before he can complain and plant a kiss square on his mouth. After a few seconds, I pull away and give him my own cocky smile.</p><p>\u201cHow about we just call it a tie.\u201d</p><p>GD stalemate.</p> <p>EPILOGUE</p><p>Two weeks later . . .</p><p>Putting on the finishing touches, I check myself in the mirror one last time and take a deep breath before exiting the bathroom. I walk out into the main area of Fool Me Once and stay silent for a few minutes as I watch my family and friends all standing around bickering with one another. Since I had a bunch of work to catch up on at the office, I brought my change of clothes with me so Griffin and I could leave for our date from here. Everyone said they were stopping by for a little congratulatory toast over McFadden\u2019s capture and that we all lived to tell the tale, but I\u2019m pretty sure they had another reason for coming here tonight. I knew Griffin wouldn\u2019t be able to keep his mouth shut. I\u2019m just thankful that Griffin still has a mouth to keep shut, no thanks to me and my idiocy out at the farm a few weeks ago. Thank God for my brother, Ted. As soon as Griffin woke up alone that morning and noticed me gone, he didn\u2019t hesitate to call my brother, who told him all about Sven/Steve and where he lived.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying, it could be a very lucrative side business,\u201d my dad states, taking a sip of champagne.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care how lucrative it is, Buddy. Prostitution is still illegal in Indiana,\u201d Lorelei tells him.</p><p>\u201cOh, speaking of whores, what\u2019s going on with that case of yours, Paige? Weren\u2019t you working on catching some slutty guy whose wife suspected him of cheating?\u201d my brother Ted asks her while he pours some champagne in her glass.</p><p>In all the chaos, I totally forgot about our other two pending cases that Paige and Lorelei took while I was busy with McFadden. I watch in fascination as Paige\u2019s cheeks redden at my brother\u2019s question. She looks away from him and quickly downs the entire glass of champagne in one swallow.</p><p>\u201cGuy? What guy? There\u2019s no guy. I don\u2019t know a guy. Who wants more champagne?\u201d she asks, grabbing the bottle from Ted\u2019s hand and walks away from him.</p> <p>Well, that was weird.</p><p>\u201cHey, Buddy, I have some work stuff I need you to sign,\u201d Uncle Wally says as he walks up to my dad and thrusts a paper and pen in his hands.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d my dad demands as he scans the page.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to read it, just sign it.\u201d</p><p>My dad huffs and continues reading.</p><p>\u201cOf course I need to read it. I\u2019m not signing something I haven\u2019t read.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake, Buddy, just sign it!\u201d Uncle Wally argues.</p><p>\u201cThis is the form to change the name of the business to Buddy Wally\u2019s Bail Bonds! You\u2019re a fucking lunatic!\u201d my dad yells before throwing the pen at Uncle Wally\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to punch you right in your arthritic hip, you old bastard!\u201d Uncle Wally shouts back.</p><p>I swear to God, nothing ever changes around here. Rolling my eyes, I look away from my dad and uncle and see Griffin perched on the edge of my desk laughing at the scene unfolding in front of him.</p><p>It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve seen him in anything other than jeans and a T-shirt. His black dress pants and blue button-down shirt are a sight to behold. He\u2019s so gorgeous it takes my breath away.</p><p>And he\u2019s all mine.</p><p>After Tinkerdoodle was returned to her owners and McFadden was taken back to jail, I promised to give him regular updates on the state of Tinkerdoodle\u2019s well-being. It\u2019s the least I could do for him since he shot off a guy\u2019s hand for me.</p><p>Steve/Sven spent several days in the hospital to repair his mangled hand and is currently behind bars awaiting trial. Considering the amount of pot they found in his basement, minus the amount that Gunnar smoked all in one day, he\u2019s going to be in prison for a very long time. Paige has been considerably quiet about the fact that she has to find a new hairdresser now, which makes me wonder all over again what the hell is going on with her lately. That case with the cheating spouse should have been a piece of cake. I am absolutely going to talk to her about it. After tonight, of course.</p><p>With a deep breath, I step away from the wall and walk out into the room. The past few weeks have been a mess of activity, and Griffin and I haven\u2019t had any time alone. Since I got to punch him in the face that day on the farm, he told me it was only fair that I make good on my part of the bet. Hence the real reason why I believe everyone decided to congregate here tonight.</p><p>The arguing stops abruptly and everyone turns in my direction. I\u2019m suddenly rethinking this whole idea as everyone in the room stares in fascination like I\u2019m a zoo animal.</p><p>Griffin is the only one who moves as he pushes off my desk and walks over to me with a look of shock on his face.</p><p>\u201cJesus, have I mentioned lately how gorgeous you are?\u201d Griffin asks as he takes in my short, red strapless dress and four-inch Jimmy Choo heels, courtesy of Paige. \u201cYou should wear dresses more often.\u201d</p><p>I smile at him and wrap my arms around his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cIf you wouldn\u2019t have ditched me two days before prom, you could have seen me in a dress long before this,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cThat was twenty years ago. Are you still holding a grudge about that?\u201d he says with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cSorry, dude. I hate to inform you, but according to chicks, there is no statute of limitations on their anger over being ditched right before prom,\u201d Bobby tells him with a raise of his glass.</p><p>\u201cFine. I am deeply sorry for not taking you to prom. Seriously. You have no idea how sorry I am,\u201d he tells me softly.</p><p>I swallow hard and stare up at him, not even caring that I\u2019m about to cry like a girl.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. You\u2019re forgiven. And I\u2019m deeply sorry for never noticing,\u201d I tell him in a rare moment of sweetness from myself. \u201cI love you, Griffin.\u201d</p><p>He closes his eyes and lets out a sigh of relief before pressing his forehead against mine.</p><p>\u201cShame on you, Kennedy O\u2019Brien, for making me wait so long to hear those words,\u201d he says with a chuckle before leaning down and kissing me while everyone in the room whistles and cheers around us. </p> </body></html>"]
