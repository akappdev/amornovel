She took out her phone to text her sister, Olivia, upstairs in one of the guest rooms.</p><p>Getting on the elevator!!!</p><p>It was always good to give Olivia a little more advance warning than most people. It didn\u2019t matter that Olivia had just made partner at her New York law firm; some things didn\u2019t change.</p><p>Oh no, was just about to get in the shower.</p> <p>Alexa got Olivia\u2019s text just as she stepped into the elevator. She laughed out loud as she pushed the number of her sister\u2019s floor, the laughter calming her nerves. Alexa couldn\u2019t wait to celebrate with her older sister, despite . . . no, maybe because their relationship was still tricky after all these years.</p><p>The elevator glided in the air, in that smooth, noiseless way elevators in expensive hotels do, while Alexa checked her purse for the third time to make sure she\u2019d tossed the fancy crackers and Brie in there. They would need a pre-dinner snack to soak up all of that champagne, after all. She wished she\u2019d found the time to make brownies the night before. Olivia loved her brownies.</p><p>She spied the cheese and crackers in the corner of her purse, tucked away from the heavy champagne bottle. Just then, the elevator stopped with a jerk. A second later, the lights went out.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she said out loud to herself.</p><p>A few seconds later, a dim light came on, but the elevator stayed motionless. She looked up and around, and jumped to see a man with a suitcase in the opposite corner of the elevator.</p> <p>\u201cWere you here this whole time?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I, a genie?\u201d He grinned back at her.</p><p>\u201cI guess you don\u2019t really look like a genie.\u201d He was a tall white guy, with tanned skin, rumpled dark brown hair, and about a day\u2019s worth of scruff where a beard would be. She had a sudden urge to rub her hand on his cheek to see how prickly it was. How exactly had she missed seeing this man get on the elevator with her?</p><p>\u201cThank you, I think. But isn\u2019t that what a genie would say?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou\u2019re not claustrophobic, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, I don\u2019t think so. Why, were you going to bust us out of here with your genie powers if I said I was?\u201d</p><p>He laughed.</p> <p>\u201cI guess you\u2019ll never know if I\u2019m a genie now,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWell, there was that time I got an MRI,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing inside that tiny machine wasn\u2019t much fun. Maybe I am claustrophobic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, you already lost your chance to see my powers.\u201d He moved to the front of the elevator and picked up the emergency phone.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see if they can give us an ETA on getting out of here.\u201d</p><p>She tried not to stare at him in the dim lighting, but she couldn\u2019t miss the opportunity to check out his butt in his perfectly fitted jeans. It was as good as the rest of him. She tried to wipe the grin off her face in case he turned around.</p><p>Stuff like this never happened to her. Not the stuck-in-the-elevator thing\u2014her life was full of minor crises like that. No, it was being stuck in an elevator with a hot guy that was the unusual part. She was always the one sitting on an airplane next to a chatty toddler, or a knitting grandma, or a bored college student; never a hot guy to be found.</p><p>After about a minute of him saying, \u201cOkay . . . okay,\u201d in progressively tenser tones, he hung up the phone.</p><p>\u201cWell . . .\u201d He paused and smiled at her. \u201cWait, I don\u2019t even know your name, my new elevator friend.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlexa, and you, Genie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrew. Nice to meet you, Alexa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrew, it\u2019s a pleasure, but . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, these circumstances are not ideal. So, the bad news is that there\u2019s a power outage in the whole hotel.\u201d</p><p>Her phone lit up just then with a text from Olivia.</p><p>My power went out. Where are you??</p><p>\u201cAhhh, yes, I was just alerted to that.\u201d Alexa held her phone up before she texted Olivia back.</p><p>Whole hotel, I\u2019m stuck in the elevator.</p><p>\u201cAt least that means they were telling the truth,\u201d Drew said. \u201cThe good news, or so they tell me, is that they have generators, so the elevators should start moving shortly.\u201d</p><p>She slid down to the floor, placing her purse gently beside her. It would be a tragedy to break that champagne bottle.</p><p>\u201cWe might as well wait in comfort,\u201d she said. Her favorite red heels were relatively comfortable for the first five hours, but she\u2019d been wearing them for nine plus.</p><p>He shrugged off his leather jacket, gifting her a glimpse of his stomach muscles as his gray T-shirt shifted. Mmmm. Hot, funny guy who occasionally flashed his abs. Was it her birthday?</p><p>\u201cSo, are you a guest here, Drew? Where are you coming from?\u201d she asked him so she wouldn\u2019t stare.</p><p>\u201cJust flew in from L.A. And you?\u201d He sat down next to her.</p><p>\u201cOh, I live here. Well, over in Berkeley, anyway. I\u2019m just in the hotel visiting someone.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her phone, her shoes, and back up at her.</p><p>\u201cA pretty special someone, with those shoes on, and all of that smiling you were doing when you didn\u2019t even notice someone else got on the elevator with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA very special someone,\u201d she said, and his grin got wider. \u201cWait, no, not that kind of special someone! My older sister! She\u2019s in town from New York for work.\u201d</p><p>Yep, this was how she usually acted around hot guys. Scared to make eye contact, stared at his abs, said something awkward.</p><p>\u201cAhhhh.\u201d He laughed. \u201cOkay, yes, I did think it was that kind of special someone. Do you two have a hot night in the city planned?\u201d</p><p>She crossed her legs and adjusted her black wrap dress so she didn\u2019t accidentally flash her underwear at this dude on top of everything else.</p><p>\u201cSort of. We\u2019re celebrating. She just made partner at her law firm!\u201d Alexa smiled down at her purse full of treats before looking back up at him. Not even cheese could compete with this dude.</p><p>He narrowed his eyes at her. Light brown eyes, with a really dark rim around them. His eyes were so pretty that she looked away again. Thank God her brown skin meant her cheeks couldn\u2019t get too pink, otherwise he\u2019d be able to see them glow in the dark.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m happy for your sister, but what is in that bag? You keep looking at it like it holds the Holy Grail.\u201d</p><p>She laughed.</p><p>\u201cJust champagne and a few snacks. The plan is to drink the champagne here and then go out to dinner . . . Well, that was the plan, but we\u2019ll see how long we\u2019re stuck in this elevator.\u201d</p><p>Drew scooted closer to her and looked in her purse. Alexa pushed it toward him, so he could see better in the dim light. She never let people poke around in her purse, but hey, this was a cute guy and a weird situation.</p><p>\u201cOkay good, we have sustenance if we\u2019re stuck here for hours. Champagne is so convenient because no corkscrew is needed, and then we\u2019ve got . . . Oh, look at that, cheese and crackers, the perfect stuck-in-an-elevator snack.\u201d</p><p>She leaned back against the wood-paneled wall.</p><p>\u201cHave you been stuck in an elevator before with a variety of snacks and been able to determine which ones are best for this situation?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, but come on, cheese and crackers are obviously the best possible option here. First of all, you had the foresight to bring a soft cheese, so we won\u2019t need a knife to cut it; we can just use the crackers to pull off bits and spread it with our fingers. And second, have you ever not enjoyed cheese and crackers? Ever not thought, \u2018Oh boy, these cheese and crackers are exactly what I need right now\u2019?\u201d</p><p>She considered for a moment.</p><p>\u201cStop, no, stop even thinking about it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know the answer is no. Cheese and crackers are objectively the perfect snack.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and pried his fingers away from the box of crackers.</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine, you\u2019re right. But you didn\u2019t manage to talk me into sharing Olivia\u2019s you-made-partner cheese and crackers with you, you know.\u201d</p><p>He stretched his legs out along the floor and took another glance into her purse. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI was afraid of that. Well, I can only hope we\u2019ll be here so long that you\u2019ll take pity on me.\u201d</p><p>She slipped her shoes halfway off, just enough to relieve the pressure on her toes.</p><p>\u201cNo offense, Drew, but my goal is not to be stuck in this elevator with you all night.\u201d Although those abs . . . No, remember Olivia? Her sister? Right, Olivia, okay, yes, Olivia. Time to ask him another question so she\u2019d stop staring. \u201cDon\u2019t you have plans tonight? What are you doing here in San Francisco for the weekend anyway?\u201d</p><p>He made a face.</p> <p>\u201cWedding.\u201d</p><p>She made a face back at him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it like it\u2019s a prison sentence.\u201d</p><p>He slumped against the wall.</p><p>\u201cIf prison sentences lasted for a weekend, this one would qualify. Okay, fine, a prison in a cushy hotel, but still.\u201d</p> <p>She looked around at the dim, still elevator.</p><p>\u201cNot so cushy right now. What\u2019s so terrible about this wedding?\u201d</p><p>He threw his hands in the air.</p><p>\u201cLet me count the ways.\u201d He held up one finger. \u201cOne: it\u2019s my ex-girlfriend\u2019s wedding.\u201d</p><p>Alexa winced. She\u2019d been there. Exes\u2019 weddings were always a trial, even in the best circumstances.</p><p>Second finger. \u201cTwo: she\u2019s marrying one of my best friends from med school.\u201d</p> <p>Alexa covered her eyes. Okay, he maybe had a point.</p><p>\u201cWere they . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she wasn\u2019t cheating on me with him, but . . . let\u2019s just say I wasn\u2019t particularly pleased about how it all happened, shall we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch. Well, I understand why you\u2014\u201d</p><p>He held up a third finger. \u201cTHREE.\u201d</p><p>She sat up straight.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s another one? A third finger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes.\u201d He waved his middle finger in the air. \u201cAs a matter of fact, this is the worst of the fingers. Three: I am a groomsman.\u201d</p> <p>She swung around and faced him, mouth wide open.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me? A groomsman? What? Why? How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are asking the important questions. The ones that Josh, Molly, and I all should have asked before this nightmare of a wedding weekend started. What and why indeed. What could have possibly inspired him to ask me to be a groomsman? Why would he do that? Why would she allow it? WHY would I say yes? How did this happen? All of those questions should have been asked, and yet, here we all are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God, Drew. That\u2019s almost enough for me to give you some cheese.\u201d</p><p>He patted her shoulder. Cheese? Hell, if he\u2019d let his hand linger there for a few more seconds, she would have given him a lot more than cheese.</p><p>\u201cAlexa, I\u2019m touched. I truly am. And then\u201d\u2014he waved another finger in the air\u2014\u201cthere\u2019s four.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh good Lord, what could four possibly be? Are your divorced parents coming to the wedding with their spouses, too, or something?\u201d</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>\u201cNo, but good guess. What a nightmare that would be. No, four is that I am not only a groomsman in the wedding of my ex-girlfriend and former best friend, but I am a dateless groomsman in the wedding of my ex-girlfriend and former best friend. My date bailed on me at the last minute, so I\u2019m going to look pathetic, and I\u2019ll probably get drunk and hit on a bridesmaid\u2014the whole thing is going to be a nightmare.\u201d</p><p>She brushed that off with a wave of her hand.</p><p>\u201cOh please, you\u2019ll be fine. Weddings are great places to meet people. It\u2019s better that you\u2019re without a date. As my friend Colleen always says, \u2018Don\u2019t bring a sandwich to a buffet.\u2019\u201d</p><p>He let out a bark of laughter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m definitely going to steal that saying. And while in most situations I would say that your friend Colleen is totally right, this is that five percent of situations where a sandwich would save me from all of the food poisoning in the buffet. I\u2019m going to get so many pitying looks, you have no idea. And the worst part is that I RSVP\u2019d with a plus-one, so there\u2019s going to be an empty seat at the head table. And lots of \u2018What happened to your girlfriend, Drew, couldn\u2019t make it?\u2019 And I\u2019m going to have to smile and take it, but there\u2019s like a thirty percent possibility I\u2019m going to have one too many glasses of bourbon and go rogue.\u201d</p><p>She touched his hand and tried not to linger there.</p><p>\u201cOkay, yes, sometimes a sandwich is a necessary security blanket. I\u2019m sorry that yours bailed on you.\u201d</p><p>He looked down into her purse again.</p><p>\u201cAlexa, I\u2019m going to need you to stop talking about sandwiches if you don\u2019t want me to steal that cheese.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed her purse and moved it to her other side.</p><p>\u201cNow temptation is farther away. Isn\u2019t that better?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her, at the purse, back at her. She smiled and kept her hand on the strap.</p><p>\u201cSo, Drew. What happened to your girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>He narrowed his eyes at her, and she laughed again.</p><p>\u201cOkay, first of all, Emma wasn\u2019t my girlfriend. We were just hanging out, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Alexa frowned at him. This guy had to be in his thirties like her. Hadn\u2019t people stopped \u201cjust hanging out\u201d with people by their thirties?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that! I\u2019m not a girlfriend kind of guy! And when I could tell that she might want something more serious, I ended it. I was nice about it! I don\u2019t do girlfriends. I haven\u2019t had a girlfriend since . . .\u201d He sighed. \u201cMolly. Anyway. Except I forgot that I needed a date for this damn wedding.\u201d</p><p>Alexa pointed to the fourth finger that he\u2019d raised in the air.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d she said. \u201cHow, exactly, is that your date \u2018bailing\u2019 on you?\u201d</p><p>He shook the finger at her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that! Don\u2019t blame this on me. It\u2019s not my fault. It\u2019s not her fault, either\u2014she was going to come to the wedding with me anyway, but her dad\u2019s having surgery tomorrow, so she couldn\u2019t come.\u201d Those ab muscles moved in a lovely way when he sighed. \u201cAnd, of course, I\u2019m sorry about her dad. I don\u2019t blame her for that at all. I do, however, think this is just more evidence that I\u2019ve been cursed when it comes to this wedding.\u201d</p><p>Alexa laughed and relaxed against the wall. If she happened to move closer to Drew while doing so, that was just an extra benefit. Hey, it\u2019s not like she was in danger of becoming this guy\u2019s not-girlfriend. She could at least get a few accidental touches of his arm in before this elevator started back up again.</p><p>\u201cYou probably did something to deserve it.\u201d</p><p>Drew reached around her and grabbed her purse.</p><p>\u201cOh, really? I pour out my heart to you about this nightmare of a wedding and how now I won\u2019t have a date and all of the terrible things that will happen to me because of that, and when you hear my tale of woe, you tell me that I did something to deserve it? Just for that, I\u2019m taking some cheese.\u201d</p><p>He reached into her purse but hesitated for a second and raised his eyebrows at her. She sighed and nodded.</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine, you can have a little cheese, but you\u2019d better save some for Olivia. And no tearing it off with your fingers. What kind of a Neanderthal do you think I am? There\u2019s a knife in there.\u201d</p><p>He beamed at her. Good Lord, that was a dangerous smile. She looked away and found the butter knife so she wouldn\u2019t throw herself at him.</p><p>He\u2019d just bitten into his third cheese-laden cracker when the overhead lights came on and the elevator started with a jerk.</p><p>\u201cWow, are we actually moving?\u201d She sat upright.</p><p>\u201cLooks like I won\u2019t have to tackle you for the champagne next.\u201d Drew got to his feet and reached out a hand to help her up. Was it just her imagination that his hand lingered in hers?</p><p>Probably. She had a very active imagination. It helped to make up for her current lack of a romantic life.</p><p>In no time at all, they reached the sixteenth floor. Alexa was treated to one more glimpse of those abs as he pulled his jacket on.</p><p>\u201cLooks like your sister and I are on the same floor,\u201d he said as they got off together.</p><p>\u201cLooks like it.\u201d She smiled up at him for a second before she had to look away from those eyes again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhich way is she?\u201d They both looked up at the arrow signs by the elevator bank.</p><p>\u201cThis way,\u201d she said, pointing to the left.</p><p>He consulted his room key.</p><p>\u201cAh, I\u2019m that way.\u201d He pointed to the right.</p> <p>They smiled at each other and didn\u2019t say anything for a moment.</p><p>\u201cI can honestly say that I\u2019ve never had a more entertaining time in an elevator. Thanks for that.\u201d He reached out a hand.</p><p>\u201cLikewise.\u201d Alexa shook it. \u201cGood luck at the wedding.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and grimaced.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t remind me. Congratulations to your sister.\u201d</p> <p>She thanked him and walked down the hall toward Olivia\u2019s room. She wished she knew what else she could or should have said to keep talking to him longer. She sighed and kept walking.</p><p>\u201cAlexa. Wait.\u201d This was crazy. Drew knew, objectively, that what he was about to do was crazy. But as she turned to walk away, he shouted for her to stop a split second later.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d She turned. \u201cYou can\u2019t have the rest of the cheese, not even as a parting gift.\u201d</p><p>Okay, here was his opportunity to play it off, pretend that that\u2019s what he was asking for, banter with this cute and funny woman with the great cleavage one last time, then turn around and go to his hotel room and get ready for this brutal weekend . . . Well, when you put it like that, maybe this wasn\u2019t so crazy.</p><p>\u201cYou . . . you wouldn\u2019t be free this weekend, would you? How long is your sister in town?\u201d No turning back now.</p><p>\u201cShe leaves tomorrow after her deposition. I\u2019m working on Saturday. I have an event at\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWorking on Saturday\u2014what about Saturday night? Even . . . Friday night?\u201d Oh please, let her be free, now that he\u2019d gone that far.</p><p>\u201cWell, I have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe my date this weekend? Please? The wedding isn\u2019t until Saturday night, so that would work, right? If you can\u2019t do Friday night I understand, but if there\u2019s any way you could come to the rehearsal dinner with me, I would . . . I don\u2019t know what I would do. Really appreciate it? Buy you all the cheese you wanted?\u201d How did he go from zero to babbling and pleading with this woman in thirty seconds flat?</p><p>\u201cDrew, I . . . Are you sure?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. With that question, he knew he\u2019d almost got her.</p><p>\u201cPositive. Come to the wedding, be my sandwich, protect me from poisoning and disaster. It\u2019ll be your good deed for the year. And it\u2019s only May\u2014look at you, getting your good deed for the year done before the year is even half over!\u201d He was so close to victory; he could tell by the smile in her eyes as she looked up at him. \u201cCome on, Alexa.\u201d He touched her shoulder. \u201cSave me.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath, and he held his as she considered.</p><p>\u201cWhen you put it like that, what else can I say? I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p> <p>He pulled her into a hug. Her champagne bottle\u2013laden purse clanked against his butt, and they both laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t regret this.\u201d He pulled back and grabbed his phone out of his pocket. \u201cWait, give me your number.\u201d</p><p>He typed in her number as she recited it.</p><p>\u201cThere, I texted you, so you have mine. I\u2019ll send you all of the details later.\u201d He turned to leave before she could say anything else.</p><p>\u201cOkay, but Drew, are you . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you tomorrow, Alexa. Congratulations again to your sister!\u201d</p><p>He sped down the hall with his suitcase, not giving her a chance to back out.</p><p>Alexa stared at Drew\u2019s back for a few seconds. Had that really happened? Had that cute stranger just asked her to be his date for a wedding? And had she really said yes?</p><p>She turned and raced down the hall to Olivia\u2019s room and knocked on the door. Olivia threw open the door and pulled her into a tight hug.</p><p>\u201cGet in here!\u201d They grinned at each other and hugged again. It was great to see her sister, it really was.</p><p>\u201cYour hair looks amazing,\u201d Alexa said. \u201cThe pictures on Facebook do not do that \u2019fro justice.\u201d</p><p>Olivia looked her over and frowned in that way older sisters can.</p><p>\u201cThe outfit is great, and I love the shoes, but I thought you were going to get blond highlights? What happened?\u201d</p><p>Alexa shrugged. \u201cSorry, I chickened out. I didn\u2019t think I could pull off the blond.\u201d</p><p>Olivia made a face at her.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t we been over this? Look at Beyonc\u00e9!\u201d</p><p>Alexa laughed. \u201cI know I\u2019m the same skin color as Beyonc\u00e9, but me in her blond weave wouldn\u2019t go over too well during city council meetings. Even though I work in Berkeley, I still work for the mayor, you know.\u201d</p><p>Olivia plopped down on the bed.</p><p>\u201cOh please, you could get away with some blond highlights, easy. But then, you always were the risk-averse one.\u201d</p><p>Alexa opened her mouth to argue but thought better of it. She was here to improve her relationship with her sister, remember?</p><p>\u201cLook what I brought you!\u201d she said instead.</p><p>She pulled the champagne and the cheese and crackers out of her purse. \u201cNot quite sure how cold the champagne is anymore, but we still have to drink it. And I heroically saved most of the cheese and crackers from the guy I was stuck in the elevator with, so we\u2019d better enjoy them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, of course we still have to drink that champagne! Gimme.\u201d</p><p>Olivia grabbed the hotel water glasses as Alexa pulled the foil off the champagne bottle.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you were stuck in the elevator all that time. And why weren\u2019t you texting me back? Was your battery out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, there\u2019s a story there, but let\u2019s toast to you before I get into all of that.\u201d She twisted the metal tie open and pulled out the cork with a gentle pop. After she poured a healthy amount into each of their glasses, she held hers up.</p><p>\u201cTo Olivia Monroe, the first black female partner at Palmer, Young and Stewart in over ten years. To a brilliant lawyer, but most importantly the best big sister a girl could have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to make me cry?\u201d Olivia said. \u201cIt\u2019s not working. I don\u2019t care if you see water in my eyes; it\u2019s just because I\u2019m allergic to this carpet.\u201d</p><p>Alexa smiled and clanked her glass against Olivia\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cCheers to you.\u201d</p><p>They both drank, hugged again, and drank some more.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is our dinner reservation? Are we going to be late?\u201d</p><p>Alexa took another sip of champagne and checked the time.</p><p>\u201cReservations are at eight and it\u2019s not even seven yet. Have some cheese.\u201d</p><p>Olivia reached for the champagne bottle and refilled their glasses.</p><p>\u201cOh wait, what was the story from the elevator? Why weren\u2019t you texting me back? I was worried that you were, like, eaten by the elevator monster or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018Elevator monster\u2019? Olivia Grace, you couldn\u2019t come up with a better fake worry than the \u2018elevator monster\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe champagne is already going to my head, and I had a six-hour flight today, so give me a break. Tell me this story immediately.\u201d Olivia set her glass down on the nightstand and gave her a stern look.</p><p>\u201cDamn, do I feel sorry for whoever you\u2019re deposing tomorrow. Does everyone you give that look to automatically spill their guts?\u201d Alexa took a fortifying sip of champagne.</p><p>The real Olivia slipped out from behind the lawyer face as she grinned.</p><p>\u201cBasically, so start spilling.\u201d</p><p>Alexa took a deep breath. It had just happened a few minutes ago, and this story still didn\u2019t seem like it had happened to her.</p><p>\u201cSo, the other person in the elevator with me was a guy.\u201d</p><p>Olivia nodded.</p><p>\u201cObviously, otherwise you would have texted me back.\u201d</p><p>Alexa kept talking so she wouldn\u2019t lose her nerve.</p><p>\u201cA cute guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, am I an idiot? Of course he was cute. He wouldn\u2019t have even known of the existence of the cheese and crackers in your purse if he wasn\u2019t. But I feel like that\u2019s not the end of this story. Wait.\u201d Olivia looked Alexa up and down. \u201cThat dress looks like it\u2019s easy to get in and out of. I am going to be SO proud of you if you had a quickie in the Fairmont hotel elevator!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Alexa gasped.</p><p>\u201cOLIVIA, eww, no.\u201d</p><p>Olivia sighed.</p><p>\u201cI knew that was too much to hope for. My prude of a little sister strikes again.\u201d</p> <p>Alexa\u2019s hand tightened around her glass. Now she was a prude for not throwing her clothes off for a stranger in an elevator?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a prude, but thanks for that.\u201d</p><p>This always had to happen, didn\u2019t it? Whenever they got together, her hopes were high, but within the first five minutes either she would manage to say something passive-aggressive to her sister, or Olivia would somehow make her feel inadequate.</p><p>Olivia nudged her once and again when Alexa didn\u2019t look up the first time.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not an insult, Lexie. You know you\u2019ve always been the well-behaved one.\u201d</p> <p>Olivia hadn\u2019t called her Lexie in a long time. She forced herself to smile.</p><p>\u201cAnyway.\u201d Alexa stood up and poured the rest of the champagne into their glasses. The bubbles would cheer her up. \u201cYou should get ready. Even though you are in San Francisco, I don\u2019t think you want to show up to dinner in that robe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet I could make it the latest style.\u201d Olivia grabbed a dress out of her suitcase and pulled it over her head.</p><p>\u201cZip me up.\u201d Alexa jumped up behind her. \u201cYou distracted me with that whole sex-in-the-elevator thing. What\u2019s the rest of the story?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, I distracted you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSemantics. Continue.\u201d Olivia reached into her purse for a lipstick.</p> <p>Alexa slid her now-much-emptier purse over her shoulder and her right foot into a shoe.</p><p>\u201cTo make a long story short: I\u2019m going to be his date to a wedding this weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWHAT??\u201d</p><p>Olivia froze in place with lipstick only on her bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Alexa smiled. \u201cI shocked you now. That\u2019s a first.\u201d</p><p>Drew tossed his bag on the hotel bed and grinned at the view from his window. He pulled out his phone and texted his buddy in L.A., Carlos, who had heard everything there was to hear about the saga of this wedding.</p><p>Found a date for the wedding.</p><p>Thirty seconds later, his phone buzzed.</p> <p>Didn\u2019t you swear off women? Like, specifically because of this wedding?</p><p>Oh right, he had done that, hadn\u2019t he?</p><p>Ok yes but this is an exception.</p><p>He investigated the sure-to-be-overpriced minibar. What the hell. He opened a beer and sank down on the bed.</p><p>Uh-huh. Where\u2019d you find this one, in between SFO and your hotel? Nothing about you should surprise me. And yet.</p><p>He knew Carlos would appreciate this.</p><p>IN my hotel, if you can believe it. In the elevator.</p><p>Drew took a long drink of his beer and pulled off his shirt.</p><p>Let me guess, tall, blond, big fake boobs.</p><p>Well, this would definitely surprise Carlos.</p><p>Short, black, real boobs.</p><p>Drew stripped and jumped in the shower, bringing the rest of his beer with him. This morning he had cursed his Friday breakfast meeting in Oakland with his mentor that forced him to get to San Francisco on Thursday night. Now he thanked whichever god had inspired Dr. Davis to schedule that meeting so early in the first place. And also the one that made him follow Alexa onto that elevator.</p><p>Even though he was paranoid about running into another member of the Rogers-Allen wedding party, he took a chance and left his room to get a burrito from his favorite San Francisco taqueria. He pulled his hoodie up over his head as he crossed the hotel lobby, though. No need to take too many chances. Luckily, he made it there and back scot-free.</p><p>Fate wasn\u2019t as kind to Drew the next morning. As he got off the elevator in the lobby, he almost bumped into none other than Josh Rogers, who was holding a cardboard tray with two big Starbucks cups in one hand and a paper bag in the other.</p><p>\u201cDrew! Oh man, it\u2019s so great to see you!\u201d Josh said, a wide smile on his face.</p><p>\u201cYeah, man, same,\u201d Drew lied, happy at least that Josh\u2019s hands were full and they couldn\u2019t do the full bro hug that he could see Josh wanted.</p><p>\u201cYou just get here? I just got coffee for me and Molly. Come up to the room and say hi? We\u2019re a little crazy with wedding stuff, but I know we\u2019d both love to catch up with you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh man, I wish I could.\u201d Josh was so nice and cheerful that lying to him was like lying to a puppy. Easy and mean all at the same time. \u201cI have to run. I\u2019m heading out to have breakfast with Dr. Davis. He\u2019s at Children\u2019s Hospital in Oakland, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, that\u2019s great! I\u2019d love to hear more about what you\u2019 re\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Josh, I don\u2019t want to be late. I\u2019ll catch up with you later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, definitely. See you tonight at the rehearsal. Oh, Molly said you RSVP\u2019d with a plus-one? New girlfriend, or . . .?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, new girlfriend. She\u2019ll be there tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome, man! I can\u2019t wait to meet her. Do me a favor and text me how to spell her name? For the place cards, you know.\u201d Josh smiled with a dreamy look in his eyes. \u201cMolly\u2019s been asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh right, of course, of course. I\u2019ll let you know. Gotta run. See you tonight!\u201d</p><p>Drew was halfway across the Bay Bridge before it hit him. New girlfriend. Shit.</p><p>Alexa stumbled into her City Hall office at 7:25 Friday morning, hungover from that bottle of champagne and all the cocktails she and Olivia had had at dinner. As she pushed open her office door, her work phone and cell phone rang simultaneously.</p><p>She dropped her bag on the floor, set her full cup of coffee down on her desk, and shook her head. \u201cNot today, Satan. I\u2019m not falling for your tricks today. My coffee hasn\u2019t even had time to cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalking to our coffee again?\u201d</p><p>Alexa looked up to see Theo, the mayor\u2019s communications director and one of her best friends, standing in her doorway.</p><p>\u201cI cannot be expected to talk to anyone except my coffee this early in the morning. I blame you for this.\u201d She blew on her coffee in the futile hope that it would cool faster.</p><p>\u201cI know you do. Sorry for the early-morning meeting, but the boss gets on a plane to San Diego at eleven, and we\u2019ve got to . . .\u201d</p><p>She waved her hand, stopping him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, yeah. You did bring me doughnuts, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He grinned.</p><p>\u201cI did not bring you doughnuts; I brought doughnuts for your boss, the mayor, who should not eat doughnuts but loves them almost as much as you.\u201d</p><p>She pulled a few files out of her bag and grabbed her laptop and the coffee, and they walked toward the conference room.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, but did you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I saved a glazed with rainbow sprinkles for you. What are you, a six-year-old girl? You\u2019re the mayor\u2019s chief of staff. You should be eating a chocolate croissant or fresh fruit and granola or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix was a wonderful time in my life. I try to keep it alive at all costs, thank you very much,\u201d she said. \u201cHave I ever told you that you look just like a black Clark Kent?\u201d</p><p>Theo adjusted his glasses.</p><p>\u201cYes, every time you\u2019re trying to sweet-talk me into being your cheerleader. I\u2019ve got your back during this meeting; no need to butter me up.\u201d He frowned at her. \u201cToday, that is.\u201d</p><p>She grinned at him and snagged her doughnut, just as the mayor and his secretary walked into the room.</p><p>\u201cWhy, exactly, are we here this early, Theodore?\u201d Mayor Emmitt boomed out, before investigating the pink doughnut box.</p><p>\u201cYou have a trip to San Diego scheduled for the climate change conference this afternoon, and so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, I know, let\u2019s get on with it. Alexa, what\u2019s this thing about delinquent teenagers?\u201d</p><p>She locked eyes with Theo, took a long sip of her coffee, and flipped open her laptop.</p><p>\u201cWell, sir . . .\u201d</p><p>An hour later, she finally managed the second bite of her doughnut as the mayor walked out the door on the way to his next meeting.</p><p>\u201cLex, you know how he is. It\u2019ll take a little time.\u201d Theo handed her the now-lukewarm coffee as they got up to walk to their offices.</p><p>She shrugged and tried to smile.</p><p>\u201cI know. Thanks for the support in there.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnytime. Did you talk to your sister about this last night? You said before that you thought she might have some ideas for you.\u201d</p><p>Alexa shook her head. She\u2019d almost brought it up a few times, but each time she\u2019d gotten too nervous to say anything.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the right time, Theo. We were celebrating, and . . . anyway, it wasn\u2019t the right time.\u201d She changed the subject. \u201cHow was your hot date last night?\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes.</p> <p>\u201cMost boring date I\u2019ve ever been on. That woman and I had nothing to talk about. Buy you more coffee and I\u2019ll give you the highlights, such as they were?\u201d</p><p>She fought back a yawn.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><p>Alexa checked her phone when she and Theo got back from their coffee run. A text from Olivia about her hangover; a few from her best friend, Maddie, about the book they\u2019d both been reading; and one from an unfamiliar 310 number.</p><p>2 things: 1) we\u2019re still on for tonight, yes? 2) what\u2019s your last name?</p> <p>Elevator guy. Tonight. Oh dear God. That hadn\u2019t been some sort of alcohol-induced hallucination?</p><p>Shit. A rehearsal dinner and a wedding at the last minute? What was she going to wear?</p><p>Yes. Monroe. And if I\u2019m coming to this thing, I need some details about when/where/etc.</p><p>\u201cEtc.\u201d meant \u201cWhat the hell am I supposed to wear???\u201d but she supposed she couldn\u2019t text that to a guy, let alone one she didn\u2019t even know.</p><p>Rehearsal dinner @7 at Beretta in the Mission. Wedding @6 tomorrow at some church, reception at the hotel. Btw I told Josh you\u2019re my new girlfriend, just fyi.</p><p>She stared at the phone for two full minutes. His new girlfriend? She had to pretend to be his girlfriend?</p> <p>I had too much alcohol last night for this.</p><p>She had a reply almost immediately.</p><p>You and your sister celebrated her partnership in style, I see. Did she enjoy my cheese?</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help but laugh.</p><p>It was HER cheese, and yes, she loved it. Why did you need to know my last name?</p><p>She reached for her coffee cup and took a gulp. Thank God she\u2019d gotten the largest size they had.</p><p>1) I should probably know my girlfriend\u2019s last name, right? 2) Josh asked for it for the place cards.</p><p>She looked up at the knock on her door.</p> <p>\u201cI was going to check to see if you needed coffee, but I see you\u2019re all set,\u201d her assistant, Sloane, said.</p><p>She almost asked Sloane to get her a pastry before she remembered she still had a doughnut sitting on her desk. She took a bite of it. Maybe the sugar would help her figure out exactly why she was going on a fake date with a strange guy tonight.</p><p>Oh right, because she\u2019d accidentally said yes, and then Olivia had accused her of being a prude, so now she had to go.</p><p>Drew is short for Andrew, I assume? I should know that if I\u2019m your fake girlfriend. I thought you didn\u2019t do girlfriends?</p><p>She scrolled through her emails and answered the easy ones as she mentally went through her closet to try to figure out what she was going to wear to this wedding. A few minutes later, Sloane poked her head back through the door.</p><p>\u201cOh hey, your lunch meeting just called to cancel. I rescheduled you for Tuesday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod bless you.\u201d Alexa checked her calendar and saw she was free almost all afternoon.</p><p>\u201cShe already has,\u201d Sloane said on her way out the door.</p><p>Short for Andrew yes (don\u2019t call me that). And, well, long story. Wait, do you work in SF? What do you do? I should know this about my girlfriend.</p><p>She took a sip of coffee and another large bite of her doughnut.</p><p>No, I work in Berkeley. For the mayor.</p><p>Wait, should she really be eating this doughnut if she was going to have to be in a cocktail dress in a few hours? Shouldn\u2019t she be drinking vitamin water or green juice or something?</p><p>Eh. She took another bite and went back to her emails.</p><p>Are you a lawyer like your sister? I\u2019m a doctor, you should probably know that too.</p><p>She laughed. Did this dude think she hadn\u2019t listened to every word that had come out of his mouth the night before?</p><p>The whole \u201cwedding of my ex-girlfriend and one of my best friends from med school\u201d thing kind of clued me in there, yeah. I am a lawyer, practiced for a while, am now the mayor\u2019s chief of staff.</p><p>But seriously, what the hell was she supposed to wear to this wedding? Time and venue were helpful, but that didn\u2019t tell her everything.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t been a bridesmaid a million times for nothing. After a few quick searches of wedding websites for the names Molly and Josh, and Saturday\u2019s date, she came up with their wedding website.</p><p>Black tie optional?</p><p>Alexa groaned and put her head back down on her desk. Her closet definitely was not built for black tie optional. After a few seconds she sat up and scrolled to Maddie\u2019s name on her phone\u2014if anyone could save her, her best friend the professional stylist could. Who knew non-celebrities used stylists? Not her, until Maddie had started her business.</p><p>Long story but I have a sort of date tonight; wedding rehearsal dinner, going with a guy I hardly know (and that\u2019s putting it mildly), and also the wedding tomorrow (I don\u2019t even know). I will tell you the whole story you know I will but the important thing is WHAT DO I WEAR HELP ME</p><p>Then she shot Drew another text:</p><p>Black tie optional wedding with a day of notice. Why am I doing this again?</p><p>Because, the voice in her head said, he\u2019s hot, and you haven\u2019t even had a fake date in over a year.</p><p>You\u2019re not going to back out on me, are you?</p><p>Drew sat in a Berkeley coffee shop, blocks from where he now knew she worked.</p><p>Please don\u2019t back out on me. Don\u2019t make me go to the buffet.</p><p>Of course she was going to back out. She was cute and funny and smart, and he oozed desperation. He didn\u2019t usually have trouble getting girls to go out with him. But finding a date for this wedding had been such a nightmare, it was like his own personal punishment for everything wrong he\u2019d ever done to or with women: first there\u2019d been everything with Emma, then when he called Julia she had a new boyfriend, and Carlos\u2019s sister had laughed in his face when he\u2019d hinted at her coming with him.</p><p>He had resigned himself to dealing with what a disaster the wedding and the aftermath would be. Then one power outage and a malfunctioning elevator had saved him, he\u2019d thought. He\u2019d maybe jumped at that solution a little too eagerly, as usual.</p><p>Not backing out. Even though . . .</p><p>Oh thank God. Sometimes his crazy impulses worked out. He sighed in relief, and his thumbs flew over the keyboard.</p><p>No \u201ceven though.\u201d Don\u2019t \u201ceven though\u201d me. I will owe you so big for this you\u2019ll have no idea. There will be a new Alexa Monroe wing in every hospital in the state. See you tonight then?</p><p>I\u2019ll be there. Please just text me ahead of time if we become fake engaged in the next few hours, OK? I\u2019ll have to borrow a ring.</p><p>What, you think I wouldn\u2019t buy you a fake engagement ring? You obviously don\u2019t know Drew Nichols very well.</p><p>Since I didn\u2019t know your last name was Nichols . . .</p><p>He laughed and downed the rest of his coffee.</p><p>Point to you, Monroe.</p><p>Another text flashed on his screen as he stood up.</p><p>;) Running to a meeting. See you later.</p><p>Alexa had looked so flabbergasted when he\u2019d told her the details of the wedding. Everyone else in his life knew most of the Josh-Drew-Molly backstory, so he had kind of forgotten how crazy it was that he was in the wedding. And the worst part was that he hadn\u2019t even told her the whole story; he\u2019d actually seemed like a good guy in the story that he had told.</p><p>There was no point in telling the woman you were stuck in an elevator with for probably only a few minutes that you\u2019d broken the heart of the nicest person in the world, the snowball that had started this whole avalanche, and you probably deserved all of the looks you\u2019d get all weekend, right? It wasn\u2019t like he\u2019d lied to her; everything he said was the truth, just not the whole truth. It wasn\u2019t like he\u2019d made Josh or Molly out to be evil, had he?</p><p>Well, maybe a little bit, but it was only because this no-date-for-the-wedding thing had driven him out of his mind. He should have just bailed on the wedding and looked like even more of a bad guy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But now he had Alexa Monroe to come along with him and play the adoring girlfriend. He\u2019d forgotten to tell her that adoring part, but maybe he could help that along some by playing the adoring boyfriend and she would get a clue? Shit, he really was going to have to buy her a hospital wing or something.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you, Alexa. Where are all your cute dresses?\u201d</p><p>Alexa\u2019s \u201cmeeting\u201d was with Maddie\u2014first at Alexa\u2019s house so Maddie could inspect her closet, then at the closest mall when her closet was not miraculously stocked with black-tie-optional dresses. Alexa had opened her mouth to plead that she had too much work to do for a shopping excursion in the middle of the day, she could just wear her one little black dress that was sort of wedding appropriate, but when she saw the look on Maddie\u2019s face, she closed it. There was no point in arguing with Maddie when she had that look.</p><p>\u201cI have a million cute dresses!\u201d Alexa said as she drove them out to the mall.</p> <p>\u201cYes, yes, of course you do,\u201d Maddie said. \u201cCute WORK dresses, but those don\u2019t count right now. You need cocktail dresses. Don\u2019t you ever go to weddings? I know you do, so where are all of your dresses from those?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been to ten weddings in the past three years,\u201d Alexa said. \u201cI\u2019ve been a bridesmaid in seven of those. I never get to buy cute dresses for weddings; they are preselected for me. And when do I ever need a cute non-work dress except for weddings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the other three weddings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wore that black halter dress that you vetoed to two of them, and to the third I wore a fantastic gold sequined dress that I rented for the weekend.\u201d</p><p>Maddie sighed.</p> <p>\u201cI remember that dress. It looked incredible on you. Well, obviously this mysterious date happened at just the right time. We clearly need to build up your cocktail dress wardrobe. Okay. Now, who the hell is this guy you\u2019re going to a wedding with?\u201d</p><p>When she told the story without all the adrenaline and champagne, it sounded even more ridiculous. She finished just as she pulled into the packed mall parking lot. What were all of these people doing here in the middle of the afternoon? Shouldn\u2019t they all be at work? Shouldn\u2019t she be at work?</p><p>\u201cThis is crazy. Why am I doing this? I should not be dragging you all over town in the middle of the workday and spending money on dresses to go to a wedding with some dude I talked to for fifteen minutes in an elevator yesterday. What am I thinking?\u201d She pulled into a parking space and reached for her phone.</p><p>Maddie took the phone away from her.</p><p>\u201cNope. You\u2019re not allowed to cancel. I\u2019m not letting you talk yourself out of this opportunity for a practice, no-stress date that just landed in your lap.\u201d</p><p>Alexa sighed and opened her car door.</p> <p>\u201cThe thing is, Mad . . . this guy is out of my league, okay? He\u2019s hot, he\u2019s funny, he\u2019s flirty, and he\u2019s a doctor. I\u2019m your standard short black girl with big boobs and hips who can barely look him in the eye without looking away. I don\u2019t even have the right clothes to wear on a date like this\u2014this is how far out of my league this is!\u201d</p><p>The problem with trying to talk about this with Maddie was that the words \u201cout of my league\u201d had never applied to Maddie. She was at least six inches taller than Alexa, with a body like a Barbie doll, light brown skin that always seemed to glow, and hair that looked perfect no matter if she left it curly or blow-dried it straight. Alexa, on the other hand, was short, what people who liked her called \u201ccurvy,\u201d and had more than once turned down social invitations because she didn\u2019t have the energy to deal with her hair.</p><p>Maddie steered her toward the entrance.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly why you have to go. Nothing is riding on this! Look: you don\u2019t know this guy, he doesn\u2019t live around here, none of this matters. Don\u2019t overthink everything like you always do. You\u2019ll just dress up, eat free food and drink free drinks, and look fucking hot the whole time if I have anything to do with it.\u201d</p><p>Alexa rolled her eyes.</p><p>Maddie smacked her on her arm.</p><p>\u201cOw! What was that for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw that eye roll, and you will look hot, I promise you. And plus, you\u2019ll get two great dresses out of the deal.\u201d</p> <p>Alexa opened the Nordstrom door and gestured for Maddie to precede her.</p><p>\u201cI have one weekend where I don\u2019t have a ton of work to do, and this is how I waste it?\u201d</p><p>Maddie threw her arm around Alexa.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not wasting anything. It\u2019s practice, remember? Plus, from those text messages you showed me, this dude will freak out if you bail on him now.\u201d</p><p>When Alexa saw the armfuls of dresses that Maddie brought into the dressing room, she thought about bailing again.</p><p>\u201cMaddie, these don\u2019t look\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t argue with me. Try them on.\u201d</p><p>She was officially an unwilling participant in that Pretty Woman shopping scene. Except she was going to have to use her own credit card at the end of it.</p><p>She sighed and stripped down to her bra and panties and pulled the first dress on.</p><p>\u201cNo, next.\u201d Maddie barely glanced at her in the dress before she vetoed it and pulled another dress from a hanger. \u201cHow\u2019s it going with your arts program?\u201d</p><p>Maddie knew everything about the program Alexa had proposed to the mayor that morning: a pilot for an arts and writing diversion program for at-risk youth. Alexa had been wanting to start something like this in Berkeley for years, and now she was finally trying to make that dream a reality. It would be a place for teens who had gotten into some trouble to come and find their gifts, to find adults who believed in them, to work hard on something they loved to do, and to get their feet on a different path.</p><p>\u201cWell, I proposed it to the mayor this morning, but he didn\u2019t say much. I\u2019m not sure what he thinks. I\u2019m worried.\u201d</p><p>She posed in front of the mirror in dress number two. She sort of liked it, but Maddie shook her head.</p><p>\u201cWas Theo there? What did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat this is just how he is and I should wait and see, et cetera. And I\u2019m sure he\u2019s right. I\u2019m just impatient. You know how important this is to me, Mads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Maddie unzipped dress number three without even commenting on it. \u201cI bet Theo is right, though. You know how your boss can be.\u201d</p><p>When Maddie looked at her in the fourth dress, she smiled and pointed to the shoes that she\u2019d ordered Alexa to bring along with her. Then she spun her finger in a circle, forcing Alexa to twirl. When Alexa caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror, her eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, I look hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmhmmm, what did I say?\u201d Maddie had that smug look on her face, but Alexa couldn\u2019t even be mad at it.</p><p>How did one little dress make her look like a movie star? It was red, with a neckline that showed just enough cleavage, and a full skirt that floated as she twirled and somehow made her waist look tiny.</p><p>\u201cMads, isn\u2019t this color too bright for a wedding? Doesn\u2019t it make my hips look too wide? Isn\u2019t it too . . . boob-y?\u201d</p><p>Maddie shook her head.</p><p>\u201cNothing, it\u2019s too nothing. It may be too expensive, but we\u2019re not going to worry about that right now. This is an emergency. It\u2019s the perfect color on you, and your hips are just the right amount of wide. And all that ruching around the waist means you don\u2019t have to wear Spanx. I know how much you hate them. Do you or don\u2019t you look hot in that dress? Did I not tell you I\u2019d find you one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be so smug about it,\u201d Alexa said, still staring at herself in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do. Okay, well, that\u2019s obviously your dress for the wedding, and thank God you have the perfect shoes for it, those gold ones you bought to wear with the gold sequined dress. Now we just need to figure out tonight.\u201d</p><p>Twenty minutes later, Alexa handed over her credit card for both dresses and tried not to wince at the bill.</p><p>\u201cThanks for this, Mads,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019d do without me, either,\u201d Maddie replied.</p><p>Drew went into the bathroom at the church just so he could check his phone for the millionth time without being so obvious about it. His desperation was back in full force\u2014he could tell from his four texts to Alexa over the past hour and a half. Texting a woman this many times was unlike him, but this stupid wedding had him on edge. She\u2019d replied only to the first one where he\u2019d tried to be cool, just confirming she was coming with a \u201csee you then,\u201d and the last, where he told her they were about to leave the church for the restaurant (\u201con my way\u201d). </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d questioned the lack of exclamation points in both texts\u2014women, in his experience, tended to use a lot of exclamation points. Did that mean she was feeling like she should have backed out?</p><p>He was certainly feeling like he should have backed out. Not from the date with Alexa\u2014no, that was the only part of the weekend that he was one hundred percent glad was happening. He should have backed out from the rest of it. Josh and Molly were being so welcoming and friendly that he felt like even more of an asshole for hating every second of this. Molly\u2019s mother, who had always been so nice to him, was noticeably chilly. Molly\u2019s sister, Amy, who had always been kind of a bitch to him, kept looking him up and down and smiling at him in a way that disconcerted him.</p><p>When they left the church, he jumped in a cab with Dan, the only other groomsman he knew well, and Dan\u2019s girlfriend. He looked down at his phone as the cab pulled up to the restaurant, hoping that maybe he\u2019d missed a vibration and she\u2019d texted to say that she was close, but there was nothing, not even an errant exclamation point.</p><p>\u201cGuys, my girlfriend is getting here any second, so I\u2019m going to wait outside for her.\u201d He hoped that at least one part of that statement was true. \u201cSee you in there, okay?\u201d</p> <p>His tension rose as other cabs full of the wedding party pulled up and he kept having to explain why he was standing there. He looked down at his phone again and fought the urge to send her a \u201cyou almost here???\u201d text.</p><p>\u201cDrew?\u201d Alexa was standing in front of him. At just the sight of her, his shoulders relaxed. Without even thinking about it, he pulled her into a hug.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea how happy I am to see you,\u201d he said into her ear.</p><p>\u201cThat bad already?\u201d Her head rested on his chest for a second until she pulled away.</p><p>\u201cNot terrible,\u201d he said, looking down at her. \u201cJust not great. You, however, look fantastic.\u201d She was wearing a silky pink dress that flattered her golden brown skin . . . and the rest of her body.</p> <p>\u201cKeep looking at me like that, and we\u2019ll have no problem convincing people we\u2019re dating.\u201d She grinned up at him.</p><p>Oh God, he was such an asshole.</p><p>\u201cOh, I . . . I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He dropped his hands from where they\u2019d been resting on her shoulders.</p><p>She patted him on the arm. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Just getting into character, right?\u201d</p><p>Not exactly, but if that\u2019s how she wanted to play it . . .</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d He smiled at her and hoped he hadn\u2019t made this girl hate him already. \u201cWhat can I say? I\u2019m delighted that you\u2019re my sandwich tonight.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled. \u201cWell, isn\u2019t that one of the loveliest things a man has ever said to me.\u201d</p><p>He leaned back against the restaurant window.</p><p>\u201cI hope that isn\u2019t true.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. A big group of guys pushed past them on the sidewalk, and he pulled her closer to him.</p><p>\u201cHey, Drew?\u201d she said. \u201cWe ever going to go inside?\u201d</p><p>He stood up straight and slid his hand into hers. Despite the chill of the San Francisco evening, her hand was warm.</p><p>\u201cInside. Right.\u201d</p><p>She stopped on the stairs on the way down to the private room where the rehearsal dinner was being held.</p> <p>\u201cBefore we walk in there,\u201d she said, \u201cis there anything I need to know so we don\u2019t look ridiculous?\u201d</p><p>He moved closer to her so no one would overhear them. Hopefully, if anyone walked by it would look like they were just having a moment on the stairs.</p><p>\u201cI told Josh that we\u2019d been dating a month, so if anyone asks that, that\u2019s the story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it. Wow, only a month and I\u2019m your girlfriend already. Moving fast, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a smart guy, I make quick decisions, and I know a good thing when I see it,\u201d he said.</p><p>She smiled up at him for a moment before her smile dimmed. \u201cAnd now I have a question for you . . .\u201d</p><p>Oh God, was she going to ask how long she had to stay? If they could have a fake breakup tonight so she wouldn\u2019t have to go to the wedding? He couldn\u2019t face this wedding alone. Ugh, maybe she wanted to know the real story behind his breakup with Molly?</p><p>\u201cAsk me anything.\u201d He didn\u2019t really mean it.</p><p>\u201cAm I going to be the only black person at this party?\u201d She looked at his chest, his chin, and finally straight into his eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He paused. \u201cHuh. I don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t think about that.\u201d</p><p>Her lips curved upward, but she wasn\u2019t really smiling.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I figured you didn\u2019t. That\u2019s why I was asking.\u201d</p><p>He could hear the murmuring and laughter from the restaurant in the silence between them. He knew she was black, obviously, but he hadn\u2019t realized until now that the entire wedding party was white.</p><p>Not that he didn\u2019t know they were all white; he just hadn\u2019t thought about it like that.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He thought for a second. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that this woman Samantha from our med school class will be there, at least for the wedding, and she\u2019s black. She and Molly were friends. Oh! And Dan\u2014he\u2019s another groomsman\u2014his girlfriend is Asian. Wait, that\u2019s not what you asked, is it? Um . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d she said. Did she really mean it, though? He couldn\u2019t tell. He\u2019d only met her yesterday. He didn\u2019t know her \u201cdon\u2019t worry about it\u201d nuances yet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t think. I should have thought about this and asked Josh, is it going to be . . .\u201d</p><p>She held a finger to his lips and smiled.</p><p>\u201cReally, don\u2019t worry about it, Drew. I didn\u2019t get through Berkeley Law School without being the only black person in the room a few hundred times. I just wanted to know what I was in for before I walked in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re okay?\u201d When she nodded, he pulled her in for a hug.</p><p>\u201cOh shit, I think I got lipstick on you.\u201d She rubbed her thumb against his chest to try to get it out. After enjoying the sensation for a few seconds, he reached for her wrist to stop her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would look pretty out of character if my new girlfriend and I walked in there after standing around outside for so long and I didn\u2019t have her lipstick on me somewhere.\u201d</p><p>Her smile made him grateful all over again that she was there with him. He wished the two of them could stay here in this stairwell all night. Actually, even better: instead of going to this dinner, they could go back to their elevator and eat cheese and crackers and drink wine and laugh together. And also maybe . . .</p><p>She pulled back and took a step down the stairs. There went his fantasy.</p><p>\u201cOkay, then, are we ready?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He reached for her hand and sighed.</p><p>\u201cReady as I\u2019ll ever be.\u201d</p><p>Boy, was it nice when this guy touched her. The hand-holding was particularly great. She felt like she was back in high school, except instead of the nerdy girl that everyone liked in that generic way, she was the girl holding hands with the hot guy at the party. She\u2019d always wondered how that had felt.</p><p>News flash: it felt awesome.</p><p>She fought back her smile before she remembered that she was supposed to be besotted with Drew, so she let it beam as they walked through the party and up to the bar.</p><p>\u201cFull bar, thank God. What\u2019s your drink of choice?\u201d He gestured to the bottles of alcohol along the bar with a flourish.</p><p>\u201cTonight? Let\u2019s start with a gin martini, please.\u201d</p><p>Drew handed over her drink and clinked it with his bourbon. They each took long sips of their drinks without breaking eye contact. Alexa glanced at an empty table in the corner and raised her eyebrows to Drew; he nodded and took her arm to steer her over there. As Drew set his glass down, a tall blond guy came over and slapped him on the back before he turned to Alexa.</p><p>\u201cSo this is Alexa? So glad you\u2019re here with Drew for the wedding,\u201d he said, holding out his hand for her to shake.</p><p>Drew put his hand on the small of her back.</p><p>\u201cAlexa, I\u2019d like to introduce you to Josh Rogers, the groom. Josh, my girlfriend, Alexa Monroe,\u201d Drew said, his hand stroking the small of her back in a way that made her whole body tingle. Or maybe that was the gin hitting her bloodstream. She ignored whatever it was and smiled at Josh as she shook his hand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA pleasure to meet you, Josh. Congratulations on the wedding! I\u2019m honored to be here.\u201d</p><p>A strawberry blonde with soft curls and a knee-length white eyelet dress walked up to them. Alexa had pegged her as the bride as soon as she\u2019d walked into the room\u2014who else would wear white to a rehearsal dinner? At her approach, Alexa moved closer to Drew. He picked up his drink and sipped it, but she knew he noticed, too, because he slid his arm around her waist. Damn, there was that tingle again.</p><p>\u201cDrew, is this Alexa? Alexa, I\u2019m Molly. It\u2019s so nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Molly gave her a huge smile that felt genuine, and not for the first time, Alexa wondered what the whole story was between the Molly and Drew breakup. Did Josh and Molly feel guilty for what they\u2019d done to Drew? Did they ask him to be in the wedding to assuage their guilt?</p> <p>She wasn\u2019t going to get an answer to that question right now (if ever), so her job was just to stand here next to Drew and turn on the charm. Luckily, she worked in politics; \u201ccharm\u201d was her middle name.</p><p>Alexa increased the wattage of her smile by at least fifty percent.</p><p>\u201cMolly, thank you so much for having me. Everything is lovely. What a wonderful choice for a rehearsal dinner. I can only imagine that the wedding will be just as beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Drew\u2019s thumb traced circles around her hip as she and Molly exchanged bright pleasantries about the wedding, the perfect weather in the Bay Area this time of year, and Josh and Molly\u2019s upcoming honeymoon in Hawaii. Between the sensuous feel of his touch and her now-finished martini, she was almost distracted enough not to wonder if he could detect the Spanx underneath her dress. Almost.</p><p>After a few minutes, Molly glanced to the corner of the room and sighed.</p> <p>\u201cMy mom is signaling me; I think I have to go talk to one of my aunts. I hope to get to talk to you more later, Alexa. And you, too, Drew. Oh, and don\u2019t forget! The hashtag is jollymosh.\u201d Molly smiled and glided away.</p><p>They only had a few seconds before a tall blond woman in a tight green dress came up to the three of them. She could feel Drew tense up next to her. She reached back to find his hand and interlaced their fingers, and he held on. She didn\u2019t have long to wonder who this woman was.</p><p>\u201cJosh, there you are. Your mom was looking for you. She had a question about what time we should sit down to eat.\u201d As Josh scurried away, her smile at Drew showed all of her blindingly white teeth. \u201cI saw my sister over here. I hope everyone\u2019s being nice to her.\u201d</p><p>Drew squeezed Alexa\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cI hope so, too. Amy, I\u2019d like to introduce you to my girlfriend, Alexa. Alexa, this is Amy, Molly\u2019s sister and the maid of honor.\u201d</p><p>Amy raised her eyebrows at her and immediately turned back to Drew.</p> <p>\u201cI hope you both have a good time at the wedding this weekend.\u201d</p><p>Amy\u2019s attitude annoyed Alexa just enough that she couldn\u2019t resist putting on a show.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure we will! It\u2019s already been pretty great, hasn\u2019t it, Drew?\u201d She winked at Drew and squeezed his hand.</p><p>His eyes widened and his smile grew smug. \u201cIt sure has, Monroe.\u201d He pulled her close. \u201cAmy, great to see you. We were just heading to the bar for another drink. Can we get you anything?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed briefly, then her smile came back.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d She looked at Drew and glanced in Alexa\u2019s direction before turning to go. \u201cNice to meet you,\u201d she flung over her shoulder.</p><p>As Drew and Alexa walked, still hand in hand, back to the bar, she leaned over and whispered in his ear, \u201cI can\u2019t tell whether she hates you or wants to fuck you.\u201d</p><p>His bark of laughter made a few people look in their direction.</p> <p>\u201cShe definitely hates me,\u201d he said against her ear, \u201cbut she\u2019s also been acting weird all day. You see why I needed you here?\u201d</p><p>Her breasts against his chest and her lips against his ear made him want to pull her even closer, but they were in a room full of people.</p><p>Oh, and right, she wasn\u2019t really his girlfriend.</p><p>\u201cI do see,\u201d she said. \u201cI think I need another drink after that interaction. I\u2019d better switch to champagne; I can\u2019t chug martinis all night or I\u2019ll be useless tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He wondered if she\u2019d noticed that he was taking every opportunity to touch her all night. Some of it wasn\u2019t even conscious; he just liked the feel of her smooth skin, the warmth of her body next to his, the softness of her hand in his.</p><p>\u201cI should have said . . . if I do anything that bothers you tonight, you know, with the pretending-you\u2019re-my-girlfriend thing, just let me know, okay? Step on my foot or something?\u201d</p><p>She turned and grinned at him, her lips so close to his that he could kiss her with just one slight movement. Just as he started to make that move, she stepped back.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I will,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you\u2019re good so far. Plus, I\u2019d be a pretty shitty fake girlfriend if I didn\u2019t let you touch me.\u201d</p><p>He put his arm back around her waist.</p><p>\u201cI would never say such a thing about the best fake girlfriend I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d he said.</p><p>As he handed her a glass of champagne, she said, \u201cOh, and by the way, when did you start calling me \u2018Monroe\u2019?\u201d</p><p>He looked up from his bourbon. \u201cWell, I thought about \u2018Lexie,\u2019 but you don\u2019t strike me as much of a Lexie.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him over her champagne glass in a way that made him step closer.</p><p>\u201cExcellent instincts there. Only my sister can call me that. I\u2019ll allow \u2018Monroe\u2019 for the time being.\u201d</p><p>He stepped closer to her. \u201cI promise I won\u2019t do anything you don\u2019t like. Cross my heart. Deal?\u201d</p><p>She looked at him for a long moment, and he felt the tension between them heat up again. What exactly had he meant by that? Whatever she wanted it to mean, he guessed. Finally, she reached for his hand.</p><p>\u201cDeal. Now, let\u2019s find some food to soak up all of this alcohol so that you don\u2019t have to pour me in a cab at the end of the night.\u201d</p><p>They followed a waiter to the corner of the room where they loaded up plates of puff pastry pockets and crostini with prosciutto. As soon as their hands were full and they couldn\u2019t move, they were surrounded. By bridesmaids.</p><p>Though the bridesmaids circling them all had perfect pink lip-glossed smiles, their hostility to Drew and curiosity about Alexa was very clear. She got it, though\u2014if any of her girlfriends\u2019 exes had showed up at their weddings, she probably would have smiled big while dropping poison in their drinks. Not enough to kill them, mind you. Just enough to make them humiliate themselves.</p><p>At that thought, she glanced down at Drew\u2019s drink, but he\u2019d already drained it. Probably for the best.</p><p>For the next ten minutes she smiled and chatted and asked questions about their bridesmaid dresses and shared her own bridesmaid-ing stories while Drew never let go of her hand.</p><p>Her shoulders relaxed when Josh\u2019s dad beckoned everyone to the tables, and Drew\u2019s hand moved up and down her bare arm.</p><p>\u201cYou see why I needed you?\u201d he said in her ear as they sat down. She turned to him and nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d have a peanut butter and egg salad sandwich right about now.\u201d</p><p>He made a gagging face and she laughed.</p><p>Luckily, the rest of the night was less fraught, mostly because they were sitting with two other groomsmen and their dates. As they lingered over dessert, Alexa glanced at the time and sighed at how little sleep she\u2019d be getting that night.</p><p>\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d Drew asked her, turning from his conversation with one of the other guys about basketball.</p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d she said in a low voice. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I have to help my boss build this playground tomorrow, which means my alarm is going off altogether too early for a Saturday, so . . .\u201d</p><p>Before she\u2019d even finished talking he had stood up.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. You have to get your beauty sleep, though it\u2019s clear that you don\u2019t need it.\u201d She made that gagging face back at him and he laughed. \u201cToo much? Can\u2019t you just enjoy the compliment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Dr. Drew, you\u2019re a sweetheart.\u201d She turned to pick up her coat but stopped when she saw him violently shaking his head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo Dr. Drew, never Dr. Drew. Dr. Nichols, thank you, though most of my younger patients just call me Dr. Nick.\u201d</p><p>They walked by Josh and Molly on the way to the door, and Alexa pulled at his hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He turned and saw her head incline toward them. \u201cOh, right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re taking off,\u201d he said to them. \u201cSee you tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>Alexa stopped, which forced him to stop, too.</p><p>\u201cThank you so much, both of you, for your warm welcome. I can\u2019t wait to celebrate with you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d Molly beamed and then hugged her. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled that you\u2019ll be there!\u201d</p><p>After another round of hugs and handshakes, Alexa followed Drew outside.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you learn to do that?\u201d he said to her, once they were out on the street.</p> <p>\u201cDo what?\u201d she asked him. He hadn\u2019t let go of her hand, and she certainly wasn\u2019t going to be the one to let go.</p><p>\u201c \u2018Thank you so much, both of you!\u2019 \u201d he said in a high-pitched voice. She swatted him with her clutch.</p><p>\u201cWe have not known each other long enough for you to make fun of my voice!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t making fun of your voice.\u201d He squeezed her hand. Okay, so he did realize they were still holding hands. \u201cI was making fun of what you said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a break.\u201d She turned in the direction of the BART station. \u201cWhere did I learn basic social graces? Where did I learn how to say please and thank you? I don\u2019t know, I think my parents taught me when I was two.\u201d</p><p>As they moved through a crowd of people, he let go of her hand. But instead, he moved closer and put his hand on the small of her back again. She could feel herself melting inside. Was he just doing this out of habit? Probably.</p> <p>She tried to remember what Maddie had said. No-stress date, relax and have fun, don\u2019t overthink things, just enjoy it. Right, okay.</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cIf I\u2019ve forgotten to say it, you made this night at least two hundred percent better than it would have been without you. Maybe more.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cI had a surprising amount of fun myself. Now, what\u2019s the plan for tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>Classic Alexa. Ignore the compliment; change the topic to logistics. Relaxing was definitely not her strong suit.</p><p>\u201cSo I was thinking . . .\u201d He dropped his hand from her back and turned to her with a weird look on his face.</p><p>Was he bored by her? Was her sarcasm too much? Was he going to say he\u2019d rather have a fake breakup tonight and not have her as his date for the wedding tomorrow so he could enjoy the buffet of bridesmaids, with the maid of honor as the main course? I had a great time hanging out with you, Alexa, he\u2019d say, but I\u2019m going to let you off the hook for tomorrow night. You don\u2019t mind, do you? And of course she would have to say no, she didn\u2019t mind.</p><p>And she\u2019d have to go return that hot red dress.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d She pulled her coat tighter around her shoulders.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe you could come get ready for the wedding in my hotel room? You know, so everyone sees you leaving from the hotel, not that I think that people think we\u2019re lying, but Amy seemed a little suspicious or something, and then you wouldn\u2019t have to . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes sense.\u201d She cut him off, trying not to show how relieved she was. \u201cWhat time?\u201d</p><p>His smile widened. He had probably gotten everything he wanted in his life with that smile. Who was she to break the pattern?</p><p>\u201cI have to be at the church by five, so just be there before I leave? There\u2019s a shuttle from the hotel to the church, and you can take that over so you don\u2019t have to sit around during the pictures.\u201d</p><p>They walked down the street, no longer hand in hand. \u201cThat sounds good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d They were at the entrance to the BART station now. \u201cOkay. See you tomorrow? Text me if you have any questions?\u201d</p><p>He leaned in for a hug. Without stopping to think about it, she kissed him on the cheek. He pulled back and looked at her for a long moment.</p><p>An ambulance roared by and they jumped apart.</p><p>He stroked her cheek with his thumb.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Monroe. See you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Alexa thanked God the next morning that the real work of building the playground was for people who actually knew what they were doing. She could still keep her boss on message and banter with the press while her mind was constantly wandering to her date that night, but if she\u2019d been operating power tools, it would have been a disaster.</p><p>By the time she knocked on the door of room 1624 she was a bundle of nerves. Maybe he thought better of this? Maybe he already checked out of the hotel and forgot to tell me? Maybe he . . . She didn\u2019t have a chance for another possible worst-case scenario before he opened the door. And then she was speechless for a moment.</p><p>She\u2019d thought Drew was hot in his worn gray T-shirt in the elevator, and she\u2019d thought he was hot at the rehearsal dinner, clean-shaven in his pale blue button-down shirt. Now, in a tuxedo, he was so hot she was afraid she wouldn\u2019t be able to look him in the eye all night.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t even fully in the tux\u2014that was the worst part. He had the shirt on and the bow tie untied around his neck, with his hair still damp. He looked like every romantic comedy hero at the end of the night, just before the heroine pulled his shirt out of his pants and started unbuttoning . . .</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d He interrupted her increasingly lurid train of thought. \u201cYou\u2019re just in time. I was about to break into the snacks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSnacks?\u201d she asked. She followed him into the room, momentarily distracted from her fantasies.</p><p>\u201cI got us cheese and crackers . . . and beer. If this is anything like most weddings, we\u2019re not going to eat for a while. I don\u2019t know about you, but I could use a drink before this night gets under way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou read my mind,\u201d she said. She dropped her tote bag on his bed and hung her dress up in the closet. \u201cI almost brought a bottle of wine, but I didn\u2019t want to start dancing on tables before the wedding even began.\u201d</p><p>He disappeared into the bathroom and came out a few seconds later with two bottles of beer in his hands.</p><p>\u201cBeer\u2019s in the bathroom sink. The champagne bucket was too small for a six-pack. Plus, there are two sinks; filling one up with ice was the biggest stroke of genius I\u2019ve had in a while, if I do say so myself.\u201d He cracked open both bottles, handed her one, and then raised his to her. \u201cTo my wedding date, and thanks again.\u201d</p><p>She took a long drink of her beer and looked around the room, trying to find something to distract herself from how much she wanted to lick that drop of condensation off his lower lip. Huge king bed, neatly made up, so housekeeping must have already come and gone. A full-length mirror by the closet\u2014great, she would need that while getting dressed. Floor-to-ceiling windows beyond the bed. She wandered over to the window, beer in hand, and glanced outside.</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d The view stretched out over the sparkling bay. She could see both the gray and white bulk of the Bay Bridge and the gleam of the Golden Gate Bridge, with the bright sun overhead.</p><p>\u201cThe view is something else, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he asked. He came up behind her so close she could feel his body heat. She wanted more than anything to lean back against his warm chest.</p><p>\u201cIt really is,\u201d she said, without turning around. \u201cOlivia was on this side of the hotel, too, but we were so busy talking I didn\u2019t even look out the window. Josh and Molly got a perfect day for their wedding.\u201d She turned to him, but he\u2019d already stepped back over to the desk.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t compete with your fancy cheese and crackers,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I did what I could.\u201d</p><p>She walked over to investigate and set her beer down so that she could dig in.</p><p>\u201cI love this stuff,\u201d she said, dipping a Wheat Thin into the tub of herbed cream cheese.</p><p>He followed suit.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not just saying that to be nice? Or because you need to eat something so that you don\u2019t jump up on that table and start dancing? Don\u2019t hesitate to do that on my account, by the way.\u201d</p><p>She took another swig of beer and grinned.</p><p>\u201cI told you, I love all forms of cheese and crackers, even that gross stuff that I used to get in my lunch as a kid with the little red plastic spreader.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He flopped down on the bed with his beer and grinned at her. She could just push him all the way down and unbutton that shirt of his. Would he have chest hair? If so, not too much\u2014that glimpse of his stomach she\u2019d had in the elevator was branded in her memory, and there hadn\u2019t been a ton of hair there.</p><p>Oh my God, what was wrong with her? A few sips of beer and her fantasies were trying to take over.</p><p>\u201cI love that stuff. I should have bought some of that,\u201d he said. Her eyes shot back to his face, and she tried to remember what they\u2019d been talking about. At least if her cheeks were flushed now she could blame the alcohol. Just to make sure that excuse would work, she drained her beer.</p><p>\u201cYou want another?\u201d he asked. He stood up and moved toward the bathroom.</p> <p>\u201cSure.\u201d She took out her makeup bag and closed her eyes. This whole thing was such a bad idea\u2014she was getting drunk in the hotel room of a hot guy she barely knew, she was getting drunk enough to fantasize about jumping a guy far out of her league, and her unwelcome fantasies were probably written all over her face because he\u2019d rolled off the bed and moved far away from her.</p><p>Oh well, at least she was getting free cheese and crackers out of this. And beer.</p><p>He came back from the bathroom with two more beers and stood next to her at the desk as she grabbed more crackers.</p><p>\u201cTell me about your morning,\u201d he said. \u201cYou built a playground? I\u2019m impressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh please, don\u2019t be,\u201d she said. \u201cThe playground building operation was well orchestrated by an actual construction company. My boss and I were just there for show and for the press. I mean, the playground did actually get built\u2014well, started, at least\u2014and I got a few splinters in the process, but everything I did was under the very close supervision of someone who knew what she was doing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut tell me.\u201d He sat down on the bed. \u201cWhere does the construction company come from? How did they figure out where to build the playground?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well, this has been a project that started almost as soon as my boss got into office. Low-income kids are a real priority of his\u2014and mine. We identified a few areas early on that needed safe and attractive playgrounds, and this is the first one that actually got built.\u201d</p><p>He leaned back on his elbows. Good Lord, was he doing this to torment her?</p><p>\u201cIs this your modest way of saying that you found the construction company and you figured out where to build the playground?\u201d</p><p>She slipped her sandals off and rubbed her toes into the plush carpet.</p><p>\u201cYes to both of those things, but I\u2019m not that modest; I just hadn\u2019t gotten there yet. I can be kind of long-winded.\u201d</p> <p>He laughed and motioned for her to toss him a cracker, which she did.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any pictures?\u201d</p><p>Alexa beamed at him and reached for her phone. She got so excited when she talked about her work. He liked that about her. He looked over her shoulder as she scrolled through the pictures of what the empty lot had been, the groundbreaking today, and some sketches of what the playground would look like when it was all finished. She was so animated in telling him about it that he couldn\u2019t stop himself from moving closer to her on the bed; close enough that their shoulders touched, that her head was almost against his chest.</p><p>She turned and looked up at him. They both seemed to realize how close they were at the same time, but neither of them moved away. His hand moved to the small of her back, up her back to the nape of her neck, and back down again. He could smell her perfume. Vanilla, with a hint of spice.</p><p>Suddenly there was a loud knock on his door.</p><p>\u201cDrew? You ready?\u201d</p><p>Dan. Not now. Not yet.</p><p>He turned back toward Alexa, but she jumped off the bed and went back to the cheese and cracker table.</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He sighed and stood up.</p><p>He threw open the door to Dan, who looked altogether too perky for the occasion.</p><p>\u201cHey, man. Oh, hey, Alexa! You almost ready for the wedding? We\u2019ll see you over there, huh?\u201d</p><p>She looked up and smiled at Dan but didn\u2019t look at Drew.</p><p>\u201cYeah, see you there. Is Lauren going to be on the shuttle?\u201d she asked Dan.</p><p>\u201cShe is! She\u2019s still in the room getting dressed, so you guys can ride over together. Here, let me give you her number, so you can be buddies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you at the church,\u201d Drew said to Alexa, willing her to look at him. She met his eyes for a second, then looked away.</p><p>He was halfway to the elevator before he heard his name from behind him and turned around.</p><p>\u201cDrew, aren\u2019t you forgetting something?\u201d she said.</p><p>He could think of many things he\u2019d forgotten to do in that hotel room, but he could say none of them with Dan standing there.</p><p>\u201cYour bow tie?\u201d He glanced down and saw the offending garment dangling from her fingertips.</p><p>\u201cOh. Right.\u201d He took the tie from her and smiled. \u201cIf you finish the beer, save that table dance for where I can see it, please.\u201d</p><p>Oh God, she had really been about to kiss him. One and a half beers and a few minutes of him listening to her talk and she was ready to pounce on him. She needed someone to talk some sense into her, and right now the only person to do it was herself.</p><p>\u201cAlexa,\u201d she said out loud at her reflection in the lighted magnifying mirror. Holy shit, she really needed to pluck her eyebrows. Thank goodness she\u2019d brought her tweezers.</p><p>Wait, she needed to focus. She was talking sense to herself, remember?</p><p>\u201cAlexa ELIZABETH. This is all fake. This is a fake date; this is a fake boyfriend. You can\u2019t just go around kissing hot guys who look like they come straight out of a movie set because they smile at you like that and listen to you prattle on about your job for a few minutes. Just because Maddie told you to practice flirting doesn\u2019t mean you get to practice kissing, too.\u201d</p><p>She cringed to think how humiliating it would have been if she\u2019d actually moved in to kiss him. He would have gently kissed her back for a second. Then he would have pulled back, put his hands on her shoulders, and said that he was very sorry if he\u2019d given her the wrong impression about everything, but she wasn\u2019t really his type. All he was looking for from this evening, he would have said, was a buddy to stick by his side and repel other women, and if that was going to be a problem for her it was totally okay for her to go home now instead of to the wedding with him.</p><p>And she would have had to suck back her tears like she always did and smile big and say oh no, it was probably just the beer getting to her, it would be no problem. And then things would have been awkward and weird all night.</p><p>Well, it was still probably going to be awkward and weird all night, but at least that would be more subtext than text.</p><p>Enough pep talk time. All she could do now was look as fabulous as she possibly could. She cued up her girl-power playlist, pulled out her reddest of red lipsticks, and threw herself into getting ready.</p><p>\u201cOne more with the maid of honor and best man\u2014Amy, you give him your bouquet this time!\u201d</p><p>Drew was more than ready for these pictures to stop and the wedding to begin. Especially because that meant Alexa would finally get here. Even though he wouldn\u2019t be anywhere near her during the wedding, at least he\u2019d have one person on his side among his sea of blatant or veiled hostility.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t texted him yet. He should check in and make sure she was on her way.</p><p>You on the shuttle over here? Everyone being nice to you?</p><p>A few minutes later:</p><p>Just getting on now. Dan\u2019s girlfriend Lauren is my new date. Glad I met her last night.</p><p>He smiled down at his phone. Oh thank God, she was on her way.</p><p>Wait, does that make Dan my date? I think I like you better, no offense to Dan.</p><p>\u201cHellooooo, Drew!\u201d He looked up to find the rest of the wedding party, sans bride and groom, staring at him. \u201cStop texting your girlfriend and pay attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019 s\u2014\u201d</p><p>Oh shit, close save. He\u2019d been that close to declaring, She\u2019s not my girlfriend, the way he did every time someone called some woman his girlfriend.</p><p>\u201c. . . on her way,\u201d he trailed off, as everyone stared at him.</p><p>\u201cGreat, that\u2019s great.\u201d Amy came up to him and put her arm around his waist. \u201cBut can we finish taking these pictures before the wedding starts without us?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He put a smile on his face and walked over with her to where the rest of the wedding party was waiting for him. He managed to disengage himself from Amy when the photographer ordered the bridesmaids and groomsmen to opposite sides of the church garden.</p><p>The groomsmen came back into the church just as the shuttle full of people arrived. Drew searched the crowd for Alexa, and when he finally saw her, laughing at something Dan\u2019s girlfriend said, his mouth dropped open. That red dress made him want to grab her hand, pull her out of the church, and bring her back to his hotel room immediately.</p><p>Josh\u2019s cousin Bill walked up to her before he could get there. What the hell was he doing, looking at her like that?</p><p>Apparently, her dress also made Drew want to tell every other man in this room that he wasn\u2019t allowed to look at her. Drew walked faster toward her.</p> <p>\u201cLadies.\u201d He got to them just as Alexa was shaking Bill\u2019s hand. \u201cMay I escort you to your seats?\u201d</p><p>Bill smirked at him.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Drew, I already claimed them. You snooze, you lose.\u201d</p><p>Drew narrowed his eyes at Bill and slid Alexa\u2019s arm into his.</p><p>\u201cOh, Bill, you must have misunderstood. This one is mine.\u201d</p> <p>They walked down the aisle in silence for a few seconds. Once they were out of earshot, she murmured, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, did I interrupt a pissing contest? I can go back to the hotel, I don\u2019t want to be in the way.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and drew her closer to him.</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t worry about it. And I won you anyway.\u201d</p><p>She raised her eyebrows at him.</p><p>\u201cYou . . . won me?\u201d she said.</p><p>He coughed.</p> <p>\u201cWait, that came out wrong. You aren\u2019t a thing to win or whatever. Sorry about that. It\u2019s just that that dude always rubs me the wrong way.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and held on to his arm tighter.</p><p>\u201cWell, I would much prefer that you win me than him, even though I am indeed not a thing to win, so I guess we agree there.\u201d</p><p>He stood at the end of the pew with her, not wanting to let go quite yet.</p><p>\u201cExcuse us.\u201d Dan elbowed him aside to let Lauren into the pew.</p><p>\u201cPoor Bill.\u201d Alexa laughed up at him. \u201cCock blocked on both sides.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t remember her looking this hot in the elevator. Good job, Thursday-night-Drew, for somehow knowing that she\u2019d be this hot when she was shoeless sitting on the elevator floor.</p><p>Oh wait, at that point he\u2019d been trying not to stare at her cleavage, so maybe he had reason to know.</p> <p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d he said. \u201cHe needs to get his own girl and stop trying to grab someone else\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>She went up on her tiptoes and kissed his cheek.</p><p>\u201cSee you at the reception.\u201d She slid past him into the pew and sat down next to Lauren.</p><p>\u201cSave me a sandwich,\u201d he said, just to make her laugh. It worked.</p><p>After the ceremony was over, Drew walked back down the aisle after Josh and Molly, with a pink chiffon\u2013clad bridesmaid on his arm. He winked at Alexa as he walked by her, and she winked back. She and Lauren told wedding war stories on the shuttle ride to the hotel and placed bets on who in the wedding party would be wasted first. (Lauren bet on Bill, but Alexa had money on Amy.)</p><p>When they got to the hotel, they followed the procession of guests up to the roof for cocktail hour and hung out in a corner with glasses of champagne and plates of something that looked very much like a fancy version of pigs in a blanket.</p><p>Thank goodness she\u2019d bonded with Lauren at the rehearsal dinner; otherwise, the ceremony and this part of the reception would have been awkward and lonely. She would have long ago sent dozens of SOS texts to Maddie. It was crucial to have another woman to laugh with, go to the bathroom with, and gossip with during a wedding.</p><p>When Lauren was halfway through her \u201cHow I met Dan\u201d story, Alexa realized what was coming and set her drink down on a nearby table.</p><p>\u201cHold that thought,\u201d she said. \u201cI have to use the ladies\u2019 room. Guard my drink.\u201d</p><p>As soon as she walked into the hall, she pulled her phone out of her clutch.</p><p>Hey boyfriend, how did we meet? I can tell Lauren is about to ask me, wanted to make sure our stories were straight.</p><p>Just as she got into the bathroom, her clutch vibrated.</p><p>The elevator, but a month ago. I was in town for that conference, remember?</p><p>Good plan. Keeping to the truth as much as possible was the best way to tell a lie. She\u2019d learned that after working in politics for a while. Not that she made it a habit to tell lies . . . but when she had to, it was best that she knew how to do it believably.</p><p>We were so happy that the wedding was back at this same hotel, weren\u2019t we?</p><p>When she got back out to Lauren, there was another plate sitting next to her drink, along with Bill, the annoying usher.</p><p>\u201cBill grabbed us some crab cakes!\u201d Lauren said. She raised her eyebrows at Alexa where Bill couldn\u2019t see her. This was also why it was crucial to have women friends at a wedding: you needed someone to roll your eyes with at all of the creepy dudes.</p><p>\u201cOh, thank goodness, this drink is starting to go to my head already. I don\u2019t want to be drunk by the time the bride and groom walk in. Thanks, Bill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure. What\u2019s your name again? Alice?\u201d He grinned at her, his eyes dropping to her cleavage. She drained her drink.</p><p>\u201cAlexa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlexa, it looks like you need another drink.\u201d He brushed some hair from her shoulder. She forced a smile.</p><p>\u201cI do, thank you. Champagne, please. Lauren?\u201d</p><p>After they sent Bill off to the bar, they both cringed and went back to their conversation.</p><p>\u201cOkay, where were we? You reached for the last carton of eggs at the farmers\u2019 market and Dan picked them up?\u201d</p><p>Alexa had finished two more crab cakes by the time Bill was back from the bar. He handed her the drink with a big smile, his eyes on her cleavage again, and his hand on her elbow. Nothing in the world would compel her to drink that glass of champagne.</p><p>She moved her clutch from her right hand to her left to shift her body away from him, but he followed. This dude. He had about five seconds to back away before she\u2019d \u201caccidentally\u201d spill the champagne on him.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you and Drew? How did you two meet?\u201d Lauren asked Alexa.</p><p>\u201cWell\u201d\u2014an arm went around her waist\u2014\u201cit was actually right here in this hotel.\u201d She turned her head, and Drew smiled down at her. \u201cHey,\u201d she said. \u201cYou guys are here.\u201d She moved closer to Drew and relaxed against him.</p><p>\u201cHey yourself.\u201d The rest of the room washed away, and it was just this dream of a guy in a tux, golden brown eyes, his fingers stroking her hip in that way that made her wish there wasn\u2019t a layer of clothes in between them and her skin.</p><p>Oh God, she was fantasizing about him again.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Dan?\u201d Lauren asked.</p><p>\u201cAt the bar. We both need a drink after all of those pictures.\u201d Drew leaned down and his lips brushed her ear. \u201cYou guys weren\u2019t having too much fun without us, were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust talking about you guys,\u201d Lauren said. \u201cSpeaking of, I\u2019ll go meet Dan at the bar. I could use another drink, too. Alexa?\u201d</p><p>Alexa nodded, only half listening to Lauren. She could stand there all night with Drew\u2019s arm around her and his fingers skimming her waist. She felt dizzy from the touch of his hands on her body and his eyes looking down at her. It was almost too much.</p><p>Bill\u2019s hand tightened on her elbow. She\u2019d forgotten he was even there.</p><p>He smirked at Drew.</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind me stealing your date, but what can I say, I got back to the reception faster.\u201d</p><p>Drew pulled her closer to him and away from Bill. His fingers kept moving over Alexa\u2019s body, drawing circles up and down her waist, moving from there to the small of her back.</p><p>\u201cGo away, Billy. The grown-ups are talking.\u201d He shooed Bill away with his fingers without taking his eyes off Alexa. After a few seconds, Bill walked away.</p><p>Alexa smiled up at Drew and opened her mouth to thank him just as his grip on her waist relaxed. Oh. He\u2019d only been holding on to her like that to protect her from Bill. That was nice of him.</p><p>She took a step back, and his arm dropped away from her. She felt colder. And much more sober than a minute before. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you for that. Did you . . . I mean how was everything with the wedding?\u201d Alexa asked him, crossing her arms in front of her chest and wishing she had that drink.</p><p>He shrugged, his hands at his side.</p><p>\u201cMostly fine. Josh was so excited it was almost cute,\u201d Drew said, itching to touch her again. He had to keep reminding himself that she wasn\u2019t really his girlfriend, or even his real date. She hadn\u2019t signed up for him to be all over her tonight, even though he could barely keep his hands off her in that dress. Even though his blood pressure had skyrocketed the second he\u2019d seen Bill with his hand on her. \u201cWant to go find Lauren and Dan now that we got rid of Bill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that you got rid of Bill, you mean.\u201d She smiled up at him, and it took everything he had not to pull her back against him. But she\u2019d stepped away as soon as he\u2019d relaxed his arm; she probably didn\u2019t want that. They walked together toward the bar, close but not touching.</p> <p>\u201cThere you guys are!\u201d Dan said. Lauren and Dan met them halfway, each with two drinks in their hands.</p><p>\u201cThe bar is swamped, but Dan cut to the front of the line,\u201d Lauren said.</p><p>\u201cPlease, take your drinks. People keep looking at us like we\u2019re lushes.\u201d Dan handed Alexa her drink. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t cut! I\u2019m a groomsman. We get front-of-the-line privileges at the bar, didn\u2019t you know that?\u201d He laughed. \u201cPlus, I tip well. It\u2019s the only way to guarantee a heavy pour at an open bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you guys were telling me the story of how you met,\u201d Lauren said. Oh good, now he had an excuse to touch Alexa.</p><p>\u201cRight here in this hotel,\u201d he said as he reached for her hand. \u201cWe were stuck in the elevator for a while together, and she made me laugh the whole time, even though she openly refused to share the snacks in her purse with me.\u201d</p> <p>She interrupted. \u201cOkay, he says that like I was sitting there eating and ostentatiously not giving him any, which was not the case! He looked in my purse\u2014without my permission, mind you\u2014saw that I had snacks, and tried to sweet-talk me into giving them to him instead of to my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably the first time anyone has ever said no to our Drew. No wonder he was intrigued.\u201d Amy. Just who he needed right now.</p><p>Alexa gave Amy one of those big, bright smiles like people gave toddlers. \u201cAmy, you certainly won the maid of honor lottery with that dress, didn\u2019t you? You all look so darling in that pale pink.\u201d</p><p>Amy\u2019s eyes narrowed at the compliment. The night before, one of the bridesmaids had mentioned that Amy had pushed hard for black dresses, but Molly and their mom had insisted on pink, even though Amy claimed the color was juvenile and that it clashed with her hair. Drew squeezed Alexa\u2019s fingers since he couldn\u2019t laugh out loud. She squeezed back.</p><p>Amy\u2019s hand was resting on the table right by Drew\u2019s. Was that her pinky finger rubbing against his? Yep, yep, it was. He put his arm around Alexa to move closer to her and away from Amy.</p><p>\u201cYour dress is great, too,\u201d Amy said to Alexa. \u201cI almost bought a dress like that for a wedding I went to last month, but I realized I was just too skinny for it. So glad you can make a dress like that work.\u201d</p> <p>Drew felt Alexa stiffen. He ran his hand up and down her back, not sure if he was trying to calm her or himself down. Probably both, because Amy\u2019s words had gotten his blood pressure up again.</p><p>\u201cThanks so much!\u201d Alexa said, lifting up her champagne glass and taking a sip. \u201cI always figure, if you\u2019ve got them, flaunt them.\u201d She gestured to her breasts, causing him\u2014and, he quickly realized, their whole group\u2014to stare at them for a second. Okay, maybe longer than a second. When he eventually raised his eyes to hers, she smirked at him. He grinned back.</p><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen!\u201d someone said over the microphone. \u201cPlease welcome Josh and Molly Rogers!\u201d</p><p>They all dutifully turned to the entryway and clapped as the bride and groom entered. Amy disappeared to the other side of the room, but he didn\u2019t move his hand from around Alexa, and she didn\u2019t move away this time.</p><p>Okay, fine. She had to admit to herself that she was smitten with him. It was past time for talking sense into herself. At this point she just had to ride it out for the rest of the night. She knew it was all fake\u2014she knew because she\u2019d been reminding herself of that\u2014but it didn\u2019t matter. Not when he was touching her like that.</p><p>At first, she\u2019d tried to give him space\u2014after Bill had moved away, Drew obviously hadn\u2019t wanted to keep up the pretense, so she\u2019d backed away. But they told their real/fake story to Lauren and Dan, and he introduced her to a million people, and all of those things necessitated them holding hands at a minimum. Or so at least he seemed to think, and it\u2019s not like she was going to disagree with him there. So she kept her hand in his and her smile aimed at him, and boy did it feel good, fake or not.</p><p>At dinner, they were at one end of the huge wedding party table, along with Amy, a few bridesmaids, and creepy Bill, with Lauren and Dan all the way at the far end. Well, at least she\u2019d had lots of practice eating food with people who were hostile to her. She\u2019d discovered tonight that working in politics had given her a lot of skills useful for being a pretend girlfriend. Drew was talking to Amy, who was on the other side of him, so Alexa chatted away with the bridesmaid sitting next to her.</p><p>While they ate their entr\u00e9es\u2014pork chop encrusted with chopped almonds for her, chicken cordon bleu for him\u2014he turned back to her while Amy complained to the waiter about something or other.</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019s your food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, actually,\u201d she said after swallowing. \u201cBetter than your typical wedding food. Want some?\u201d She cut a piece and held out her fork to him.</p><p>He recoiled. Was this too familiar for someone she\u2019d just met two days before? Did he forget he was supposed to be her boyfriend in this scenario? Or maybe he hated sharing food?</p><p>Whatever it was, it didn\u2019t make her feel great.</p><p>Amy leaned around Drew to laugh at Alexa.</p><p>\u201cYou trying to kill Drew already? What did he do now?\u201d</p><p>Alexa raised her eyebrows at Drew. Now she was pretty sure what the problem was, but she was interested to hear how he was going to play this one off.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Drew leaned forward and put his hand on her shoulder. \u201cI guess this hasn\u2019t come up yet, but I\u2019m allergic to nuts.\u201d</p><p>He hated himself for that hurt feeling that had crossed her face before that very bright (and, he suspected, very fake) smile had flashed back on. He rubbed his hand down her arm, trying to apologize with his touch in the way he couldn\u2019t with words, not with all of these people listening.</p><p>\u201cWeird, because that was one of the first things you told Molly,\u201d Amy said. \u201cI remember her telling me that.\u201d Was Amy actually suspicious, like he\u2019d wondered last night, or was she just being a bitch?</p><p>\u201cMolly and I were in med school at the time. Things like that were more at the front of our minds.\u201d He turned halfway to Amy, his hand still on Alexa\u2019s arm. \u201cAlexa and I have been busy with other things, but I figured it would come up. And look, it has.\u201d</p><p>The conversation around them moved on to how good the mashed potatoes were, Josh\u2019s stepfather\u2019s faux pas at the ceremony, whether people thought the DJ would be good or not. As soon as Amy pontificated loudly about how she\u2019d told Molly to get a band instead, he moved his chair closer to Alexa and turned so his lips were almost against her ear.</p><p>\u201cThat was all my fault. I\u2019m so sorry. Probably should have let you know about my deathly allergy before we ate a meal together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d He could hear the smile in her voice. \u201cAlmost killing my date makes a wedding exciting.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. Okay, good, she wasn\u2019t mad at him.</p><p>\u201cNo chance of that. We\u2019re surrounded by doctors, remember? I bet at least ten people have EpiPens on them, just for kicks.\u201d</p><p>Did she realize her hand was resting on his thigh? It was probably just because of the way he was sitting right against her so he could whisper. Her hand was probably on his thigh by default. He didn\u2019t care. He just wished there was a way to keep it there. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAlexa, I\u2019m heading to the ladies\u2019 room. Want to come with?\u201d</p><p>He liked Dan\u2019s girlfriend, Lauren, but he could cheerfully kill her right now. Hmm, did she have any allergies?</p><p>He watched Alexa as she crossed the room, laughing about something or other with Lauren. Yep, still hot in that dress from this angle.</p><p>For a second, he wondered what the night would have been like if Alexa wasn\u2019t there with him. That was easy: miserable. With her here, though, it had been more than okay. Fun, even, which is the last thing he thought this wedding would be.</p> <p>\u201cAnother drink?\u201d Dan plopped down in the seat next to him.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh, yeah, sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got it bad with that one. Nice going.\u201d Dan jerked his head in the direction of where Lauren and Alexa had disappeared. Drew had no idea how to respond to that, so he just shrugged and smiled.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Bill slurred. \u201cI\u2019d hit that one. I\u2019ve always wanted to bang a black girl. What\u2019s it like, Drew?\u201d</p><p>Drew didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d stood up until he felt Dan pull him in the direction of the bar. He resisted for a second, the rage in his bloodstream pushing him to charge at Bill, but after a second or two he allowed himself to be dragged away. Dan waved at the bartender, who promptly set two neat whiskeys at the end of the bar for them.</p> <p>\u201cI could throw him off the roof,\u201d he said to Dan once he\u2019d calmed down enough to speak.</p><p>\u201cYou could,\u201d Dan said. \u201cAnd you probably should. But maybe wait until after the wedding? Too many witnesses right now.\u201d</p><p>Drew picked up his drink and looked around the room for Alexa. At least she hadn\u2019t heard Bill.</p><p>\u201cAll I know is that I\u2019m keeping him the hell away from Alexa for the rest of the night.\u201d</p><p>Lauren ran up to her room to retrieve her lipstick, so Alexa killed some time texting Maddie an update from inside one of the bathroom stalls. All of a sudden, her ears perked up at a conversation by the sinks.</p><p>\u201cI thought Drew was the one to break up with Molly?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe was. He totally destroyed her when he did it, too.\u201d That was Amy. \u201cBut I bet he was pissed when Josh and Molly started dating.\u201d She laughed. \u201cWhen he gets rid of that date of his, I have an idea for a place he can find someone who looks a lot like Molly.\u201d</p><p>The conversation faded as they left the bathroom. Drew had told her Molly had broken up with him, hadn\u2019t he? Had he lied to her, or was she remembering things wrong?</p><p>Thirty seconds later while looking in the mirror she got another hit to the psyche. One glance down at her clutch to take out her lipstick, and when she looked back up, she was flanked by thin blond women.</p><p>All three of them were in cocktail dresses shorter and tighter than anything she\u2019d dare to wear because of her thighs and hips and butt. Their perky little breasts were obviously unencumbered by bras, and their long, thin legs looked even longer and thinner because of their sky-high heels. And there she was in between them, in the dress that her friends would say made her look \u201cvoluptuous,\u201d which was just another word for \u201cfat.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t believe Maddie had convinced her not to wear Spanx. She\u2019d felt great in that dress just a few hours ago when she left Drew\u2019s hotel room, but was that just beer and flattering lighting? Maddie had never steered her wrong before, but then Maddie was her friend and loved her. Maddie would give her tough love about many things in life, but she would never say something bad about her body. That was the problem with good friends: they were too damn supportive sometimes.</p><p>And she\u2019d spent the night falling deeper and deeper in lust with Drew, with those damn tingles every time he touched her, and the whole time he was probably looking at all of those other women, wishing he was with one of them.</p><p>She needed to shake this off to get through the rest of this night. Pep-talk-in-the-hallway time.</p><p>Okay, Alexa Elizabeth Monroe, she said in her head, none of this matters, remember? You\u2019re just here because you told Olivia and Maddie about it before you realized you should back out. You\u2019re wearing a great dress, you\u2019re drinking some free alcohol and eating good food, and you\u2019re going to leave in\u2014</p> <p>She started when she felt a hand on her shoulder mid\u2013mental pep talk. Not Drew\u2019s. How was it that she already knew his touch? She shook off that question and turned to find Lauren behind her.</p><p>\u201cThere you are! Dan texted me that he and Drew are over at the bar. Let\u2019s go find them.\u201d</p><p>They found them at the bar, all right. Drew, Dan . . . and Amy. Alexa sighed. Maybe she needed another pep talk. Amy\u2019s little dig about being too skinny for a dress like Alexa\u2019s had already been ringing in her ears, and now she was standing there with her hands all over Drew.</p><p>The cotton candy pink did look ridiculous on her, at least.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Drew said as Alexa and Lauren approached. He felt like he\u2019d been scanning the room for her for an hour. \u201cYou guys found us.\u201d He stepped away from Amy and put his arm around Alexa\u2019s waist.</p><p>\u201cNow are you guys coming?\u201d Amy asked.</p><p>Alexa turned and looked up at him with a question in her eyes. Before he could answer it, Amy grabbed his hand.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re going to cut the cake, remember?\u201d she said. Yeah, he remembered. Amy had been bugging him about it for the past five minutes. Why he had to stand around and watch two people put a fake cut into a huge cake, he\u2019d never understand.</p><p>Plus, he\u2019d rather stand over here in the corner with his arm around Alexa\u2019s waist.</p><p>\u201cIn a second, Amy. We\u2019ll meet you over there.\u201d</p><p>Amy huffed and walked away. He turned his full attention back to Alexa. But instead of looking back up at him like he wanted her to do, she stared after Amy with a weird look on her face.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re cutting the cake. Let\u2019s go watch.\u201d</p><p>He reached for her hand as they walked across the ballroom and was glad when she took it. Was she upset about the allergy thing? She\u2019d barely even glanced at him when she came back from the bathroom.</p><p>As they stood in the crowd surrounding Josh and Molly, she gripped his hand and stared fixedly ahead with that big smile from before planted firmly on her face.</p><p>\u201cAre we cool?\u201d he said in her ear. She jumped. Something occurred to him. \u201cIs something wrong? Did Bill say anything to you?\u201d</p><p>She turned to him with her eyebrows raised.</p><p>\u201cBill? No, why?\u201d</p><p>He looked into her eyes, but she seemed to be genuinely confused. Okay, Bill hadn\u2019t gotten to her, and it seemed like no one had told her what Bill had said.</p><p>\u201cNothing, don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a big deal.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes didn\u2019t move from his face. Fine, he wouldn\u2019t have believed himself, either.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you later,\u201d he said, wondering if that would work.</p><p>It didn\u2019t.</p><p>Her laughter had no mirth in it. The crowd around them oohed and aahed at the stupid cake. She put her finger on his chin and tilted his head down to be level with her own.</p><p>\u201cIt was either something gross about my body or something racist. Which one?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Around them, people toasted to Josh and Molly. Alexa let go of him and raised her glass. He lifted his by rote and drank.</p><p>\u201cThe latter,\u201d he said, after a few long moments.</p><p>She took another sip of her drink.</p><p>\u201cHe seemed like that kind of guy,\u201d she said.</p><p>Molly came up to them before he had a chance to apologize for Bill.</p><p>\u201cDrew, Alexa, hi! Alexa, I didn\u2019t get a chance to say earlier, you look so beautiful tonight!\u201d Molly was red-cheeked and beaming, not quite drunk but definitely tipsy. Drew knew the signs.</p><p>\u201cOh, Molly, thank you so much, but you look stunning! That dress is incredible and this wedding has been so lovely. Thank you so much for welcoming me,\u201d Alexa said, squeezing Molly\u2019s hand. No one would have been able to tell from the look on her face that they\u2019d just been having a kind of tense conversation.</p><p>\u201cYou are so kind. I\u2019m so delighted that Drew has found you!\u201d Molly said.</p><p>So was he, he realized.</p><p>\u201cSo am I,\u201d he said, and slid his arm around Alexa\u2019s waist. She relaxed against him, and he sighed in relief. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, you two are so adorable!\u201d Molly said. Okay, maybe she was more on the drunk side of the spectrum. \u201cAnyway, I wanted to let Alexa know that I\u2019m about to throw my bouquet!\u201d</p><p>A look of horror flashed over Alexa\u2019s face before she covered it with that now-familiar big, bright smile. Big, bright, fake smile.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Alexa said to Molly. \u201cOkay, great!\u201d</p><p>Molly hugged both of them again and fluttered to the middle of the dance floor, collecting bridesmaids and female wedding guests as she went.</p><p>\u201cI guess I should go over there.\u201d Alexa drained her champagne glass and handed it to him but made no move toward the dance floor.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to sound quite so excited about it.\u201d He pushed her in Molly\u2019s direction. She rolled her eyes at him but walked over and joined the gaggle of women in cocktail dresses. Lauren caught her arm and said something that caused Alexa to double over in laughter. He wanted to know what had made her laugh like that and how he could duplicate it. Not only to see that glimpse of her boobs in that red bra . . . but partly to see that.</p><p>As soon as the bouquet left Molly\u2019s hand, Alexa and Lauren took slow, steady steps backward. After a scuffle, one of the bridesmaids triumphantly raised the bouquet, but his eyes were on Alexa, by that time at the far end of the dance floor. He saw Alexa and Lauren turn to each other with identical fake pouts on their faces. This time he was the one who doubled over laughing.</p><p>Dan nudged him.</p><p>\u201cShould we be insulted?\u201d Dan gestured in the direction of Lauren and Alexa, clapping and pouting as the bridesmaid waved the bouquet.</p><p>Drew laughed again.</p><p>\u201cNah, I think we should be feeling pretty smug that we\u2019re dating the smartest women in the room,\u201d Drew told him. Alexa and Lauren had formed a circle with a few other women, all dancing to \u201cSingle Ladies\u201d with their hands in the air. \u201cShall we join them?\u201d</p><p>Alexa danced with Lauren, letting the movement and the laughter shake away her annoying thoughts. When she felt a hand on her waist, she turned to see Drew behind her and laughed again, at how ridiculous the evening had been and how much fun she was suddenly having. He took hold of one of her hands and swung her around to face him and laughed back down at her. Other members of the wedding party joined their group and danced with and around them, but song after song came on, and he never moved from her side.</p><p>\u201cWater?\u201d he said in her ear after they\u2019d been on the dance floor for a long time.</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d She walked with him over to the bar.</p><p>She glanced up at the ornate clock over the bar, surprised at how late it had gotten. And how much she didn\u2019t want this night to end. Damn it, it had been fun to be Drew\u2019s fake girlfriend, but she knew that once the clock struck midnight, so to speak, the fairy tale would be all over.</p><p>He leaned against the bar, his jacket off, his bow tie untied, a little sweaty and disheveled from dancing. Good Lord, this guy was hot.</p><p>He rolled up his sleeves, exposing his tan forearms. She wanted to run her fingers up and down them and feel how warm and strong they were.</p><p>She needed to stop letting her imagination run away with her.</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s getting late, and if I want to make the last BART train back to the East Bay, I should probably leave pretty soon.\u201d</p><p>Why had she said that? Why, when she was standing next to a hot guy, basically panting over him? If she was Maddie, hell, if she was Amy, she would have grabbed one of those hot forearms and wrapped it around her body, letting him know what she wanted without having to say anything. Sadly, she was Alexa, so she would flee instead.</p><p>He put his water bottle down and looked at her.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said. Olivia and Maddie would get mad at her for not throwing herself at him, but they didn\u2019t understand that she just didn\u2019t know how. Plus, rejection from this guy was the last thing her self-esteem needed. Talk about the opposite of getting back on the horse; that would make her avoid horses, and stables, and all farm animals for another few years. So to speak.</p> <p>He stepped closer to her and put his hand on her waist. Her hand landed on his arm, and without even meaning to, she ran her fingers up and down. Oh God, touching him like this was as good as she\u2019d thought it would be.</p><p>\u201cOr\u201d\u2014he looked straight down into her eyes\u2014\u201cyou could stay.\u201d</p><p>A question was in his eyes, and a smile hovered over his lips. His thumb drew slow circles on her hip and then moved up her side to her ribs. His other hand moved up to her face and traced the outline of her lips with his fingers.</p><p>She shivered.</p><p>He waited.</p><p>\u201cOr,\u201d she said, \u201cI could stay.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her against him and kissed her. Their lips clung together softly at first, then with more urgency. He tasted like bourbon and chocolate cake and everything she\u2019d ever craved. She sighed against his lips and murmured his name, and she could feel his smile. Her hands moved into his hair, that hair that she\u2019d been wanting to touch all night, and he kissed her harder. His hand cupped her cheek, and the gentle touch on her skin as she felt the heat of his mouth had her nerve endings on fire.</p><p>It seemed like they were all alone in that crowded ballroom. The people and the noise swirled around them as his lips touched hers, his tongue slid inside her mouth, his body pressed up against hers.</p><p>They pulled apart for a moment, and he smiled down at her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to do that all night,\u201d he said, his golden brown eyes staring straight into hers. He kissed her cheek, her ear, her collarbone. His tongue traced her lips before he claimed her mouth again. She moved her hand in between them so she could touch his chest, wishing there was no fabric under her fingers but just his skin.</p><p>Her touch seemed to alight something in Drew. He moved his hands to her back and tugged her against his body. His hands felt like iron against her back, and his rough touch sent a thrill up and down her spine. She bit his lip in retaliation for the bruises she\u2019d have the next day. He laughed and sucked her lip into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cSorry for interrupting,\u201d Amy said, sounding not at all sorry.</p><p>They pulled away from each other, both breathing hard.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Amy?\u201d Drew didn\u2019t look away from Alexa. He looked at her like he wanted to throw her over his shoulder, take her into a dark closet, and screw her senseless. Maybe that was just what she wanted him to do.</p><p>\u201cMolly and Josh are about to leave. You\u2019re needed for the pictures.\u201d</p><p>He finally looked in Amy\u2019s direction. Alexa tried to step out of the way, but he grabbed her hand, not letting her go.</p><p>\u201cGreat, we\u2019ll be there in a second,\u201d he said. Amy stood there looking from Drew to Alexa for a few seconds before she sighed and stomped away.</p><p>Drew turned back to her.</p><p>\u201cHow about instead of going to take more pictures, we go upstairs right now?\u201d</p><p>Was this really going to happen?</p><p>She squeezed his hand and let go.</p><p>\u201cGo take the pictures. Patience is a virtue,\u201d she said. \u201cStand still.\u201d She reached up and rubbed her thumb against his lips and cheek. \u201cWe can\u2019t have you in the wedding pictures with my lipstick all over you. Okay, now you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed his tux jacket from the chair where he\u2019d abandoned it and walked with her, hand in hand, over to the wedding party. Drew tried to keep Alexa with him, but she pushed him toward the rest of the groomsmen and faded into the background.</p><p>He tried to take this last set of pictures, to look excited and surprised to see Josh and Molly waving at the crowd, but his eyes kept straying in Alexa\u2019s direction. Her hair was disheveled, her lipstick had mostly rubbed off, and she looked so incredible that he wanted to push her against the wall and pull that dress off her shoulders.</p><p>Amy came up behind him.</p><p>\u201cCan you just, for the next few minutes, pretend that you ever cared about my sister and take a few damn pictures without staring over at what\u2019s-her-face over there?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. As much as he hated to agree with her, Amy had a point.</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay, fine.\u201d He took a deep breath and turned back to the photographer. Without looking at Amy, he said, \u201cI did care about your sister, you know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She snorted.</p><p>\u201cYou had an interesting way of showing it.\u201d She moved closer to him and waved as Josh and Molly left the room. He started to walk away, but the photographer spun in their direction and told them to do \u201csomething spontaneous.\u201d Amy put her arm around his waist and kissed his cheek. He grinned for the camera and hoped it didn\u2019t look too much like he was gritting his teeth. He jumped when he felt Amy\u2019s hand on his ass.</p><p>\u201cI put my room key in your pocket,\u201d Amy whispered in his ear. \u201cIn case you want to escape that date of yours and compare sisters later. I can promise I\u2019ll beat out Molly. I\u2019ve always been the wild one.\u201d</p><p>That was a new development. He and Alexa had joked about Amy either wanting to kill him or fuck him, but he hadn\u2019t really believed it. Apparently, she wanted to do both?</p> <p>Now he was even more grateful that Alexa was there. Because he knew himself, and he knew that if he hadn\u2019t met Alexa in that elevator, at this point in the wedding he would be just drunk and impulsive enough to make yet another bad decision.</p><p>He stepped away from her, and her hand fell.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks, Amy. You have a great night.\u201d He backed away from her and the rest of the wedding party, and turned to find Alexa.</p><p>She was sitting on one of the couches in the corner with Lauren and Dan . . . and Bill. That big, fake smile was back, and her legs were crossed tightly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in my seat,\u201d he said to Bill with a shooing motion. When Bill didn\u2019t get up, he wanted to punch him in the face, but Dan caught his eye. Instead, he reached out a hand for Alexa. She took it and stood up.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s time for us to call it a night, don\u2019t you?\u201d he said. He pulled her close, maybe a little closer than necessary. Dan and Lauren stood up, too, and all four of them walked out of the ballroom without another word to Bill.</p><p>\u201cDid he bother you?\u201d he said to Alexa as soon as they were out of earshot.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cHe was probably about to, but I had a drink in my hand, and I was not afraid to use it.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d been speaking quietly, but Lauren turned around at that.</p><p>\u201cThat guy is an ASSHOLE.\u201d</p><p>Dan waited for them to catch up, then whispered to Drew, \u201cDid you tell her what he said?\u201d But his \u201cwhisper\u201d was more like a shout. Dan had never been a quiet drunk.</p> <p>\u201cNo, but she figured it out,\u201d Alexa said.</p><p>\u201cHe tried to talk to me in Japanese!\u201d Lauren said. \u201cI\u2019m Korean. Come on.\u201d</p><p>As they waited for the elevator, Drew stood behind Alexa and wrapped his arms around her. She leaned back against him and set one of her hands against his. Every time she touched him seemed like a secret message reminding him of their kiss and what was to come.</p><p>When an elevator finally came, they stood against the back wall, his arms still around her. Her hair tickled his chin when he bent down to whisper in her ear.</p><p>\u201cI think this is our elevator.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her softly when she turned her head toward him.</p><p>\u201cI think so, too.\u201d She smiled. \u201cI hope we don\u2019t get stuck again, no offense to Dan and Lauren.\u201d</p><p>When the elevator stopped on Drew\u2019s floor, Lauren and Alexa hugged.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I would have done without you,\u201d Alexa said to Lauren. \u201cEspecially during the bouquet toss.\u201d The women waved good-bye as he and Alexa got off the elevator. Drew could still hear Dan\u2019s laughter echoing in the elevator as they entered his hotel room.</p><p>\u201cI really liked Lauren,\u201d Alexa said as the room door closed behind them. He didn\u2019t give her a chance to say more before his mouth descended on hers. He pushed her up against the door and boxed her in with his arms. Her hands tangled in his hair and pulled him closer. She pushed his jacket off his shoulders, ripped his shirt out of his pants, and slid her hands up and down his chest.</p><p>He moved down to her neck, licking and sucking until she wrapped one leg around his waist and pulled him flush against her body. Just kissing this woman was the best thing he\u2019d done all month.</p><p>He pushed one strap of her dress off her shoulder and bent down to kiss the curve of her breast.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to do that all night,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been wanting you to do that all night,\u201d she said. Her head was back against the door, and her eyes were closed. She stroked his hair, scraping his scalp with her fingernails in a way that made him shiver. He pushed the other strap down and the dress with it until it hung to her waist.</p><p>\u201cGood Lord.\u201d He stared at the red lace of her bra, and what was underneath it.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a nice reaction.\u201d Her hands drifted to his waist, and her fingers moved against his skin. As he stared, unmoving, she reached up to unbutton his shirt. After she\u2019d unfastened two buttons, he growled and pulled the whole thing off over his head.</p><p>She tried to reach for him again, but he pinned her arms against the wall, holding both of her wrists with one hand.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he said to her. \u201cTell me what you want.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, her eyes half lidded and hazy.</p><p>\u201cDo you want this, Alexa?\u201d he asked, his free hand moving up and down her torso.</p><p>\u201cYou know I do,\u201d she said, her eyes closed. She pushed her chest against him, but he kept his touch gentle. He could sense her frustration. He loved it.</p><p>\u201cThen tell me what you want me to do to you.\u201d</p><p>Finally, she opened her eyes wide and smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cKiss me.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t specify exactly where she wanted him to kiss her.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, Drew.\u201d</p><p>But she hadn\u2019t seemed to mind the place he chose.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get you on that bed.\u201d He picked her up by the waist, took three steps across the room, and tossed her on the bed. She laughed as she landed on the pile of pillows. He took a flying leap and landed next to her. He rolled on top of her as they laughed together. He tickled her, and she giggled as she tickled him back.</p><p>\u201cThis dress has to come off,\u201d he said, tugging at the hem.</p><p>\u201cThese pants first.\u201d She reached for his waistband. He sat back and watched her unbutton and unzip him. The sight of her, dress half off, lips swollen and bitten, hands on him, made him grin at his own good fortune.</p><p>She grinned back at him, grabbed him by the hair, pulled him down to her, and kissed him. He relished the feel of her body under him, her softness against his hardness, her hands in his hair and rubbing up and down his back. After a long while, he pulled back again and looked down at her half-naked body.</p><p>\u201cI really need to get this dress off you,\u201d he said.</p><p>She pushed the dress off her hips and threw it onto the floor. He saw a flash of red underwear as she lay back against the pillows.</p><p>Drew rolled her underneath him and moved his hands to her breasts. Alexa let her eyes flutter closed, enjoying the sensation as his fingers caressed the underside of her breasts and moved upward. But then his hands stopped moving. She opened her eyes, and he looked straight back at her, that small smile on his face.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he said again.</p><p>She wiggled underneath him, willing him to start moving again, but it didn\u2019t work. He seemed to enjoy frustrating her. Luckily, he was really hot while he was doing it.</p><p>\u201cAlexa.\u201d He ran his hands through her hair, then down the sides of her face once, twice. \u201cTell me. You know I want to hear you say it.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath and reminded herself that it was just one night, that she didn\u2019t need to be embarrassed. She took his hand in hers and moved it to where she wanted it.</p><p>\u201cKiss me?\u201d It had worked so well the first time.</p><p>He smiled and bent down to her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a start,\u201d he said.</p><p>Oh wow. Making out with him in bed was even better than it had been against the door. Now he knew what she liked, the moves that made her moan and gasp and sink her fingers into his shoulders.</p><p>He sat up and smiled down at her, his eyes on her bright red panties. She mentally thanked Maddie for ordering her to wear a matching bra and panty set. Then all thoughts of Maddie and anyone else left her mind. He moved like a flash down her body, pulling those panties off as he went and throwing them across the room. And then he set about doing things to her with his fingers and his mouth that almost made her black out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After she collapsed against the pillows, he lifted himself off her, a smug smile on his face. Not that she blamed him. He had every right to be proud of himself after that. He trailed kisses up her body, on her stomach, her breasts, her neck, until he finally dropped a light kiss on her mouth and rolled over next to her.</p><p>She turned to face him. She moved her hand to his side and felt the hardness of his chest and the trail of hair that disappeared into his waistband. Holy shit, this guy was something else.</p><p>\u201cThat was . . .\u201d She tried to think of something to describe what that had been like, and failed. \u201cThat made me incoherent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that.\u201d He leaned forward and kissed her, harder this time. \u201cI liked it.\u201d</p><p>She tugged at the waistband of his boxer briefs.</p><p>\u201cThese have got to come off,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd something else has to come on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot going to argue with that.\u201d He pushed himself off the bed, pulled his underwear off, and dug into his bag, coming up a few seconds later with a box of condoms.</p><p>\u201cThis what you were referring to?\u201d he asked. He got back on the bed before she had a chance to admire his naked body. He didn\u2019t move from her side and looked over at her.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said. That seemed to be what he was waiting for. A half second later, she was on her back.</p><p>She laughed up at him, and he grinned down at her, and then wiped the smile from his face.</p><p>\u201cThis is not a laughing matter. We have serious work to do.\u201d</p><p>Alexa tried to stop smiling, but her lips curved up despite herself.</p><p>\u201cWell, never let it be said that Alexa Monroe doesn\u2019t believe in the value of hard work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmm.\u201d He ran his hands up and down her hips, and pushed her knees open. \u201cI would never say that.\u201d</p><p>Minutes . . . or hours . . . later, he collapsed on top of her.</p><p>\u201cGood God,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t we been doing this since thirty seconds after that elevator got stuck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are apparently both very stupid people,\u201d she said in his ear.</p><p>\u201cVery, very stupid,\u201d he said.</p><p>They stayed like that for a few seconds, both trying to catch their breath. Eventually he reached down, pulled the condom off, and rolled over onto his back, pulling her with him. Her head was on his chest, her legs splayed on either side of his. She could be happy just like this for the next few weeks. Maybe months.</p><p>What was it about this guy? Every other first time she\u2019d had sex with someone\u2014and often the second and third and fourth time\u2014she had worried about how he\u2019d felt about her body, or if he was really attracted to her or not, or if he really liked her boobs or would rather they be smaller or perkier, or some other niggling anxiety that had prevented her from really relaxing and enjoying herself.</p><p>She\u2019d always enjoyed herself but was still self-conscious, never quite wanting to do certain positions because of how her stomach or her butt would look or what he would see. And she\u2019d certainly never been able to say what she wanted out loud, never at first, sometimes never at all.</p><p>But with Drew, she\u2019d been able to throw herself into the whole experience from the first kiss. She\u2019d even thrown her clothes off without worrying about what he would think and how he would react to her body.</p><p>Good Lord, was this what one-night stands were like? Maybe it was because she was never going to see this guy again after she left the hotel in the morning. They barely knew each other, they\u2019d met two days before, and he lived in L.A., for Christ\u2019s sake. She could be completely honest; she could totally enjoy herself, with no repercussions, no regrets. That must be it.</p> <p>Whatever the reason, it had been pretty damn great.</p><p>\u201cThat was . . .\u201d He caressed her back and kissed her shoulder instead of finishing his sentence.</p><p>\u201cMmmmhmmm,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSleepy?\u201d He kissed her cheek.</p><p>\u201cI can barely move,\u201d she said against his chest. \u201cMy limbs all feel like they\u2019re made out of melted butter.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and she felt his chest rumble underneath her face.</p><p>\u201cHold that thought for one minute.\u201d He turned her over and got out of the bed. After a trip to the bathroom, he slid back in next to her, tucked the covers over both of them, and pulled her close.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Alexa.\u201d He wrapped her up in his arms.</p><p>She ran her hands up and down his arms and relaxed against his body.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Night, Drew.\u201d</p><p>She woke up a few hours later, her back pressed against his chest, his arms circling her. She felt like she was in a snug, warm, masculine cocoon. She had never realized how much that was the ideal place for her until just that moment. There was just one problem.</p><p>She had to pee.</p><p>Okay, Alexa. Just don\u2019t think about it. Just lie here and be content in this cozy sleeping bag of pure male goodness and let that lull you back to sleep.</p><p>She listened to his even breathing, felt his chest move against her back and the prickle of the hair on his legs rubbing against hers, and smiled. She could do this.</p><p>Her bladder disagreed. It increased the pressure and reminded her of all of that champagne she\u2019d drunk and those bottles of water that had closed out the night. Oh God, she really had to pee.</p><p>No, Alexa. Just stay here. Go back to sleep. Don\u2019t think about anything liquid. You can do it. Enjoy this perfect moment.</p><p>She took a deep breath, clenched everything, and tried to relax against him again, reaching back to that voice in her brain for a pep talk.</p><p>I have to pee I have to pee I have to pee!</p><p>When even her internal monologue had abandoned the cause, she gave in. She slowly moved out of the circle of his arms in an attempt to not wake him up, pulled back the sheet, and tiptoed into the bathroom.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t closed the curtains\u2014apparently, they\u2019d been preoccupied\u2014so light shone into the room from the lit-up skyline. That gave her enough light to get from the bathroom to the bed without tripping over the shoes, clothes, and underwear littering the floor.</p><p>She got into the warm bed, trying to figure out how she could get back to her perfect cocoon from earlier. He was still on his side, but his arms were folded now; she couldn\u2019t very well push herself back against his chest and wrap his arms back around herself, could she?</p><p>Well, she could, but not without waking him up, she decided after thinking about it for a few seconds. She lay down on her pillow and admired his naked chest, hoping that maybe he would roll over to her in his sleep and she would get to finish her night off with his arms and legs draped around her again.</p><p>\u201cYou going to come back over here or are you going to leave me cold and lonely for the rest of the night?\u201d he asked, his eyes still closed.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were asleep.\u201d She scooted closer, and he wrapped his arms back around her. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to wake you up.\u201d</p><p>He leaned down to kiss her, and their lips clung together. She really liked kissing this guy.</p><p>\u201cEven if you had woken me up,\u201d he said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have minded.\u201d</p><p>Something inside of her melted. At his words, his smile, his touch. She stroked his stubbly cheek and pulled his head back down toward hers.</p><p>They kissed again, longer, slower. The urgency of earlier in the night had disappeared. They kissed like they had days, weeks, years to do nothing but lie in this bed and explore each other.</p><p>His fingers moved from her back to her neck, then to her hair. His lips touched her cheeks, her eyelids, and the tip of her nose, which surprised a giggle out of her. Not content to be passive, her hands ran down his chest, dancing over his nipples, pressing into his muscles, squeezing his hips.</p><p>When her fingers lingered there, he said, \u201cAren\u2019t you going to keep going?\u201d</p><p>At this moment, in this hotel room, this night? She would do whatever he wanted her to do. She slid down his body to where she knew he wanted her to go.</p><p>\u201cI really like the way you do that,\u201d he said afterward, once he got his breath back. She crawled up from the bottom of the bed and collapsed on top of him.</p><p>After a few minutes, she started to roll off to the side. He stopped her.</p><p>\u201cWhere exactly do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d His hands were on both sides of her waist, holding her in place.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She tried to think of a good way to say it and gave up. \u201cI thought I might be too heavy, so I was going to . . .\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His hands gripped her tighter.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re perfect.

Because if so, I don\u2019t want you to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She tilted her head back so she could see his face. \u201cI\u2019m happy right here.\u201d</p><p>He wrapped his arms around her again, and she leaned her head against his chest.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said. \u201cSo am I.\u201d</p><p>Drew woke up the next morning with Alexa\u2019s body flush against his, his leg draped over her hip, and her hands on his butt. What a fucking fantastic way to wake up. He thought about letting her stay asleep\u2014he really did. But then he remembered that he was leaving in a few hours. He needed to get all of this woman he could.</p><p>He ran his fingers up and down her body. My God, her skin was so smooth. He pulled down the covers and looked at those breasts that made him salivate. If he remembered last night correctly, which he thought he did, she really liked it when he played with her breasts.</p><p>As soon as he squeezed, she opened her eyes and smiled.</p><p>\u201cMmmm, what a nice way to wake up,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI thought you might think that.\u201d</p><p>After round three\u2014or was it two and a half?\u2014they curled up together in bed breathing hard.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d she said into the pillow.</p><p>He lifted himself up and looked at the bedside clock.</p><p>\u201cJust after nine.\u201d</p><p>She snuggled against him.</p><p>\u201cHey, Drew?\u201d</p><p>He grinned.</p><p>\u201cI just met you two days ago, so how do I already know that that\u2019s your \u2018I want something\u2019 voice? Haven\u2019t I done enough for you this morning?\u201d he asked the top of her head.</p><p>He felt her smile against his chest.</p><p>\u201cMmmm, you definitely have done quite a lot. But you know what else you could do?\u201d</p><p>He put a hand over hers, trapping it where he loved to feel it.</p><p>\u201cKeep doing that and I\u2019ll do whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and kissed his shoulder.</p> <p>\u201cDoes that mean you\u2019ll call down to room service and order me coffee?\u201d</p><p>He flipped her on her back and pressed her against the bed as she smiled up at him. Her hair was wild, she had makeup smudges around her eyes, and he wanted to keep her in this bed all day.</p><p>\u201cCoffee?\u201d he said, a fake tone of incredulity in his voice. \u201cI got the \u2018I need a favor\u2019 voice for coffee? Are you that easily pleased or do you love coffee that much?\u201d</p><p>Still on top of her, he reached for the bedside phone and dialed room service.</p><p>\u201cAt this point, I think you know how easily pleased I am,\u201d she said as her fingers walked down his body.</p><p>He played with her nipple again as he placed a very large room service order. She sighed and moved beneath him while he was on the phone. If they hadn\u2019t just had sex, he\u2019d be grabbing a condom just from watching her do that. When he hung up and pulled her back into his arms, he wasn\u2019t quite ready for round four, but he was pretty happy to think about getting there soon.</p><p>\u201cHold that thought.\u201d He rolled off the bed and into the bathroom. When he came back into the room, he hunted for his wallet so he could tip room service when it arrived. He found it in the back pocket of his pants, along with a stray room key.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, I forgot to tell you: Amy slipped me her room key last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She sat up straight.</p><p>He plopped on the bed next to her.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know, right? She said something shitty about you and then something shitty about Molly and then slid her key into my pocket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d Her smile faded for the first time in hours. He wasn\u2019t sure why, but he wanted to make her laugh again.</p><p>\u201cSo I guess you were right, about her either wanting to kill me or fuck me . . . though I\u2019m still not sure which one.\u201d</p><p>It worked, for a second. But after her laughter subsided, that thoughtful expression came back.</p><p>\u201cSo, last night at one point I was in the bathroom.\u201d She paused.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh?\u201d Was she going to tell him about people having sex in the bathroom? That would start round four off with a bang.</p><p>\u201cNo one knew I was in there . . .\u201d Oh good, this was getting even better.</p><p>\u201cAnd I heard Amy tell someone about when you broke up with Molly? Am I remembering incorrectly or did you imply that it was the other way around?\u201d</p><p>Oh shit. His hand dropped.</p><p>After he didn\u2019t say anything for a while, Alexa pulled the sheet up to her neck. That did not seem like a good sign for round four.</p><p>\u201cSo I guess that means I wasn\u2019t remembering incorrectly.\u201d</p><p>He sat up and sighed. Why was it just too much to ask for him to get through this weekend without having to talk about this?</p><p>\u201cYeah, I broke up with Molly. Yeah, I implied that it was the other way around to you. I don\u2019t know why.\u201d</p><p>She sat there for a while looking at him, her knees drawn up and her hands clasped. Guess he could wave good-bye to round four. Oh, the hell with it.</p><p>\u201cFine, I do know why: because I was an asshole to Molly, and I don\u2019t like telling people, especially the cute women kinds of people I\u2019m trapped in elevators with, that I was an asshole to a good person.\u201d</p><p>The tight grip of her hands relaxed, and she touched his arm, just for a second.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said. \u201cThank you for being honest and not bullshitting me right there.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, looking at his knees instead of her. He might as well tell her this whole story now.</p><p>\u201cMolly and I dated for about a year and a half. She\u2019s a very nice person, as you probably noticed.\u201d He could see her nod out of the corner of his eye. \u201cAnd I really cared about her. I maybe even loved her. I\u2019m not sure if I was in love with her, but I think I loved her. If that makes sense.\u201d She nodded again, and her hand went back to his arm, staying there this time.</p><p>\u201cRight before her birthday I overheard her on the phone talking to one of her friends. She thought I was planning to propose and was all excited about it.\u201d He was still staring at his knees. He had a scar on his right knee from that fall he took while running a few months back. He would be happy to tell her that story instead of this one.</p><p>He took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cI pretty much panicked. I wasn\u2019t ready for that. I definitely hadn\u2019t been planning to propose, and now I didn\u2019t want to deal with her disappointment when I didn\u2019t. So of course, like an asshole, the next day I told her I didn\u2019t think it was working out and broke up with her. Right before her birthday. And then I dated three other people in the med school in quick succession. Kind of a jerk move.\u201d</p><p>Her hand moved up his arm to his. He grabbed it and held on.</p><p>Molly had hated him after that. Hell, he\u2019d hated himself. She\u2019d forgiven him eventually, because she was Molly and (he strongly suspected) because Josh had gone to bat for him. Which is why he was at the wedding in the first place.</p><p>\u201cAnd the whole Josh thing?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t start dating right away. In fact, they didn\u2019t start dating for well over a year. But I still felt betrayed when they did, even though I had no right to feel that way. And even though Josh asked me if it would be okay. I guess I felt like . . . when I was ready to get married, Molly would be around for that.\u201d</p><p>He sighed and let go of her hand.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, we dated, I was an asshole, eventually I apologized for being such an asshole, Josh is a great guy, last night she married him. There, the whole story, more or less.\u201d</p><p>She tightened the sheet around her body and turned to him.</p><p>\u201cSo . . . this wedding was kind of your penance, then?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He leaned against one of the pillows they\u2019d pushed out of the way during the night and finally met her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI guess so,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s one reason why I was dreading it so much. And why I needed a sandwich so badly.\u201d</p><p>He hoped that she\u2019d laugh at that, but she didn\u2019t. She didn\u2019t even meet his eyes.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He touched her arm. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should have been honest with you before you came here last night and not just because you found out somewhere else.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She met his eyes and nodded.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d was all she said.</p><p>\u201cAre you mad?\u201d he asked. He didn\u2019t want to push this. And he definitely didn\u2019t want to keep talking about it. But he didn\u2019t want her to be mad at him. They only had a little while left.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not mad,\u201d she said. She looked at him for a minute, and her smile became more of a real one. \u201cI did find out last night, you know. If I was mad, I wouldn\u2019t be here right now.\u201d</p> <p>He shouldn\u2019t ask. He really shouldn\u2019t. She\u2019d think that\u2019s why he apologized, and it wasn\u2019t. But he couldn\u2019t help himself.</p><p>\u201cDoes this mean there\u2019s a possibility for round four?\u201d he asked, and he reached for the sheet she\u2019d used to cover herself up.</p><p>She looked down at his hand on the sheet and met his eyes.</p><p>\u201cThree and a half, you mean.\u201d</p><p>He pulled the sheet covering her torso down and drew his thumb over her breasts. Her eyes followed his thumb as it stroked her body.</p> <p>\u201cI guess that means that I have some work to do,\u201d he said.</p><p>He pushed her back down on the bed as she laughed. As they kissed, his fingers played with her nipples in the way that he now knew she liked. When his lips trailed down to her breasts, her fingernails dug into his back. Did she know that he liked that? He hoped so. He\u2019d make sure to tell her in a second. He drew a nipple into his mouth, and\u2014</p><p>\u201cRoom service!\u201d came the call from outside.</p><p>She groaned and covered her face with her arm.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said as he stood up. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who insisted on coffee.\u201d</p><p>She sighed dramatically and he laughed.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t remind me.\u201d She got out of bed, too. \u201cI\u2019m going to the bathroom. The room service guy doesn\u2019t need to see me naked, even if it\u2019s under a sheet.\u201d</p><p>Once she was safely in the bathroom, he let the room service guy in and tipped him well. While the guy set up the tray on the bed, Drew double-checked what time his flight was. Noon. Which meant he\u2019d have to leave for the airport in, like, thirty minutes.</p><p>Damn it. It wasn\u2019t enough time.</p><p>But there were a ton of flights from San Francisco to L.A. every day . . .</p><p>\u201cIs the coast clear?\u201d she shouted from the bathroom after the door closed behind room service.</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou can come out now.\u201d When was the last time he\u2019d laughed this much? He\u2019d been laughing with her ever since that first moment in the elevator.</p><p>She padded out of the bathroom, wrapped in a towel this time, and took a big sniff of the air.</p> <p>\u201cAhhhh, coffee.\u201d She got back in bed and poured herself a cup from the carafe on the tray.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d He disappeared into the bathroom, his phone still in his hand. In few clicks, he changed his flight to the one at eight that night. Now he could relax.</p><p>He came back out of the bathroom\u2014not covered in a towel\u2014and was pleased to see her eyes follow him as he crossed to the bed.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were going to start flexing any second,\u201d she said as he climbed into bed next to her and reached for his own coffee cup. He pulled his hand back, met her eyes, and slowly made a fist. She laughed at him but bent over and kissed his bicep.</p><p>\u201cI poured you coffee,\u201d she said, sipping her own. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t know how you take it.\u201d</p><p>He poured half the container of cream into his coffee and shook in few sugar packets. She looked from the pale brown liquid in his mug to the unadulterated blackness of her own and laughed.</p><p>\u201cI would make a \u2018I like my coffee the way I like my men\u2019 joke, but it would be either inaccurate or just really dirty.\u201d</p><p>He put his arm up next to her mug, pretending to be injured.</p><p>\u201cWhat, I\u2019m not black enough for you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She put her arm up next to his mug.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, it seems like I\u2019m too black for you,\u201d she said.</p><p>His coffee was paler than her skin color; she was right. Oops. Somehow that didn\u2019t seem like the right observation to make.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean . . . I wasn\u2019t trying to . . .\u201d He looked from his cup, to her, covered up by the white sheets again, and back to his cup. Everything he could think of to say sounded like a terrible idea. \u201cUm.\u201d</p><p>She turned his face toward hers, forcing him to look her in the eye.</p><p>\u201cStop. It\u2019s okay. I was just joking.\u201d</p><p>He saw the smile on her face and relaxed.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d she said, uncovering the room service plates, \u201clet\u2019s eat some bacon so we\u2019re all fortified for round three and a half.\u201d</p><p>Afterward, they lay curved around each other in bed again, his head on her chest, her fingers drifting through his hair.</p><p>\u201cDrew?\u201d she said eventually. \u201cWhen do we have to get out of here? What time is your flight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until eight tonight.\u201d Hopefully, she wouldn\u2019t ask why he was leaving so late. If she did, he could make up something. \u201cI have to check out in\u201d\u2014he glanced at the clock by the bed\u2014\u201ctwenty minutes, though. So . . . if you aren\u2019t busy for the rest of the day, we could hang out. We\u2019ll have to get out of here, but we can go somewhere else. Eat tacos, relax in the park, go for a walk, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Or go back to her place, maybe? \u201cI mean, unless you\u2019re busy. You probably have a work thing to do, or something, so no worries if you do.\u201d</p><p>He was rambling, but he couldn\u2019t help it. Why didn\u2019t it occur to him when he changed his flight that she might have something else to do today? Now, not only was he going to have to say good-bye to her very soon, but he would then have to wander around San Francisco alone for the rest of the day. He was so preemptively annoyed that he almost missed her response.</p><p>\u201cSure, why not? Let me jump in the shower.\u201d</p><p>Alexa grinned at her reflection in the bathroom mirror. How exactly was this happening to her? Not only had she had crazy, dirty, great sex all night with a really hot guy, but said hot guy wanted to spend the day with her? For once, she was going to ignore all the work she had to do today.</p><p>Thank God she\u2019d gotten ready in his room yesterday, so she had her hair stuff and something to wear other than a cocktail dress.</p><p>As they loaded their bags into his rental car, she mused over the past two days, all of which the Alexa of Thursday afternoon would have never believed. Hell, the Alexa of nine a.m. Sunday wouldn\u2019t have believed she\u2019d still be with him at noon. The sex had been great\u2014really great\u2014and he\u2019d made it pretty clear that he\u2019d thought so, too. But she had figured he\u2019d want to get out of the hotel as soon as he could on Sunday and leave all of the reminders of the wedding behind. Including her.</p><p>She shrugged. He had a late flight back to L.A. and needed something to occupy his time, and she was around and available. It wasn\u2019t any more than that. She probably shouldn\u2019t have jumped so quickly when he asked her if she could hang out today, but she couldn\u2019t fool herself. She didn\u2019t want this weekend to end yet. At this point, when he said jump, she\u2019d ask how high.</p><p>She could hate herself for that on Monday. Sunday was all his.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you just eat a bushel of bacon?\u201d she asked him as he drove toward the Mission. \u201cYou\u2019re really ready for a burrito already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNumber one: I worked off that bacon, as you well know,\u201d he said. He grinned at her, and she grinned right back. \u201cNumber two: I\u2019m not quite ready for a burrito yet, but I know that I will be soon, so we might as well get them and find a good spot in Dolores Park. It\u2019s already nice and sunny, and it\u2019ll get busy.\u201d</p><p>She watched his profile as he drove, a little sad he had shaved that day. His smooth skin was nice against her face, but just the thought of the feel of his stubble last night on her cheeks, her lips, and her thighs made her shift in her set.</p><p>\u201cYou used to live in the Bay Area?\u201d she asked. He\u2019d mentioned something about that to one of the wedding guests the night before. She\u2019d nodded and smiled along like she already knew his whole life story, but now she actually got to ask questions.</p><p>\u201cYeah, had a fellowship for two years at Children\u2019s Hospital in Oakland. I loved it. Great hospital.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He glanced to his right as he went to turn and slid his hand onto her leg. She hoped he left it there for a while.</p><p>\u201cWhy pediatrics?\u201d Apparently, now she couldn\u2019t stop asking questions.</p><p>He shrugged and laughed.</p><p>\u201cIs it corny to say \u2018because I like kids\u2019? But . . . it\u2019s because I like kids. I thought I was going to be a regular surgeon when I started med school, actually. But I did a pediatrics surgery rotation, and it was just so much more fun. The doctors were great, the kids cracked me up, there were always toys around . . .\u201d</p> <p>She laughed and touched his hand to interrupt him.</p><p>\u201cYou picked your specialty because of all of the toys? Figures.\u201d</p><p>He turned his hand over and held on to hers.</p><p>\u201cSee, I knew you would make fun of me. Tell the truth: if you had to choose between two jobs, one with toys all over the place and one without, which one would you pick?\u201d She thought about it for a second, and he squeezed her hand. \u201cSee?\u201d</p><p>He flicked on the blinker, waiting out the people behind him also vying for the parking spot he\u2019d found.</p> <p>\u201cSo, what does a mayor\u2019s chief of staff actually do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything, really.\u201d They got out of the car and into the line outside of La Taqueria. \u201cManage everything day to day, supervise a lot of different departments, stay on top of major events going on around the city and the Bay Area, crisis management, policy, and on and on.\u201d</p><p>When they got to the front of the line, they ordered carnitas for him, al pastor for her, and guacamole and salsa and chips for both of them. He won the fight for the bill.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get a job like that?\u201d They stood in the corner while they waited for their food, his arm around her waist, her body snug against his.</p><p>Don\u2019t get used to this, Alexa, she reminded herself. She almost pulled away from him but decided to hell with that. She had six hours left with this guy; she might as well enjoy it while it lasted.</p><p>\u201cI worked in the city attorney\u2019s office one semester in law school, and I really liked it. You got to do a little bit of everything, but you still felt like you were doing something for the public good. After law school, I managed to get a job there full-time. A few years ago, the old mayor retired, and my boss\u2014then the city attorney\u2014decided to run for the job. When he won, he made me his chief. I\u2019m kind of young for this job. It probably should have gone to someone older and more experienced.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you wanted it more,\u201d he said.</p><p>She smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cI did want it more. I worked damn hard for it, too.\u201d</p><p>She tucked their burritos and chips in her tote bag and they left the taqueria.</p><p>\u201cYou want to walk or drive to the park?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWalk. We can\u2019t count on getting another parking space. This isn\u2019t like L.A., you know. There isn\u2019t going to be a valet up there for us.\u201d</p><p>He took her hand as they turned up the street.</p><p>\u201cOoooh, I guess we\u2019ll have to see if my slow Los Angeles legs are up to walking up these great big San Francisco hills.\u201d</p> <p>She laughed at him. As they walked the mile to the park, they talked the whole way, about their jobs and what they liked most about them, their daily aggravations, their stress relievers.</p><p>The park was crowded, but they found a spot in a sunny corner. He reached inside her tote bag and pulled out a towel for them to lie on.</p><p>\u201cWhere did that come from?\u201d she asked, looking from her bag to the towel and back at him.</p><p>He flopped down onto the towel and gestured for her to sit next to him. She stood there looking down at him, the bag of burritos in her arms, not moving.</p><p>\u201cA genie put it there?\u201d he tried.</p><p>She raised her eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cIt was a gift from the hotel? An apology for the stuck elevator?\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, fine, I took it, but it should have been an apology for the stuck elevator. We needed something to sit on. What did you want me to do, take the sheets?\u201d</p><p>Alexa gave in and sat down next to him. She handed him the bag of burritos and cracked open her Mexican Coke.</p><p>\u201cFor the record, just because I sat here doesn\u2019t mean I condone this theft. I\u2019m a public servant, after all.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and reached for his burrito.</p><p>They ate their burritos in silence and watched the people go by. Dolores Park on a sunny day in San Francisco was like a public party, everyone coming out to enjoy the brief escape from the fogbank. There were groups of shirtless men drinking beer, women in sundresses eating ice-cream cones, tech bros in dot-com T-shirts and baseball caps checking out the women in sundresses, multiracial families pushing strollers on their way to the playground, teenagers on skateboards, solitary people with books, churro and hot dog and coffee vendors, old men chatting together in Spanish or Russian, the scent of weed wafting in their direction every five minutes.</p><p>Alexa wrapped up the second half of her burrito, kicked off her sandals, and lay back. She could feel the grass under her toes and the sun on her face. A few minutes later, she felt Drew lie down next to her. Not quite touching her, but almost.</p><p>\u201cI should check my email.\u201d She made no move to do so. What she really wanted to do was reach for his hand, but now that they were out of the hotel room\u2014and the hotel room bed\u2014she had lost some of her nerve.</p><p>That was a couple-y thing to do, and despite everything that had happened this weekend, the two of them were not a couple. They both knew that they were only together right now because he had time to kill before his flight. And she knew she was there because she didn\u2019t want the weekend with him to end yet.</p><p>He picked up her purse and moved it to his other side, out of her reach.</p><p>\u201cNo, no checking email,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re here with me now\u2014no email, no phones, no checking in with your boss.\u201d He put his hands behind his head and gave her that smug\u2014and, okay, fine, sexy\u2014grin. Damn it if she wouldn\u2019t do anything to make him keep grinning at her like that.</p><p>But . . . she\u2019d felt her phone vibrate a few times through her tote bag as they walked to the park. She really should check.</p><p>She looked around, grateful that they were behind a tree for what she was about to do. She rolled on top of him so she could reach into her purse for her phone. Just when she was about to roll back off, his hands came around her waist and held her in place.</p><p>His face was so close to hers. This smile was really all for her. Not for show, or for photos, or to convince her to be his date, or to sleep with him. It was just for her, Alexa, right now, in this moment.</p><p>\u201cOh, you think you can distract me with your body so you can get to your phone, do you?\u201d She moved, not really trying to get away, just seeing what he would do. His hands tightened on her hips. \u201cWell, you\u2019re right about that. You don\u2019t play fair, Monroe.\u201d</p><p>She grinned and pushed away from him for real. He released her but kept his arm around her as she lay on her side next to him and checked her phone, her head on his chest.</p><p>She ignored the texts from Maddie\u2014no way she could answer them with him right there\u2014and went straight to the emails from Theo and a deputy city attorney. She emailed Theo back a quick answer but paused to think for a while about the other email. She finally suggested that they meet on Monday afternoon; some conversations were easier in person than in text.</p><p>When she looked up, Drew was looking down at her, no longer smiling.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay there? Or do you have to go?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She moved away from the curve of his arm and sat up, and he let her go.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d</p><p>Did he want her to go? Did he want her to say, Yeah, as a matter of fact, my boss has a public park\u2013related crisis. I need to rush back to Berkeley immediately. It was nice knowing you? Was he tired of dealing with her and her wide hips and all of her talk about her job and was he ready to go home to L.A. and leave this weekend behind?</p><p>He sat up, too.</p><p>\u201cYou were frowning at your phone. I thought something might be wrong.\u201d</p><p>Oh, the hell with it. She might as well take one more risk this weekend.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t have to go,\u201d she said. She paused and looked down. \u201cUnless . . . you\u2019re ready to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered immediately. She looked up at him, and his smile was tentative now. \u201cI don\u2019t want either of us to go anywhere.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When Alexa smiled at him, relief shot through Drew\u2019s bloodstream. She lay back down on the towel, and Drew lay down next to her, facing her. They moved the conversation away from the big topics of jobs and weddings and ex-girlfriends. Instead, they made up pretend conversations for the people around them, fed leftover tortilla chips to a friendly puppy who came by with his owner, and tried not to laugh when a teenage skateboarder attempted to fly down the church steps across the way and fell.</p><p>\u201cShhhh,\u201d he said when she couldn\u2019t hold it in anymore. \u201cYou\u2019ll hurt his pride.\u201d</p><p>She giggled, and he giggled with her, and suddenly they were laughing so hard they couldn\u2019t breathe. At the delight of watching someone fall down, at the joy that they\u2019d both found it so funny, at the pleasure of being together in the sun, enjoying each other\u2019s company so much. He didn\u2019t even realize when it happened, but somehow his arms were around her and her head was against his chest as they shook with laughter.</p><p>When their laughter finally slowed, and then stopped, he looked down at her. Her cheeks were pink from the laughter and the sun, her hair was tousled, and her eyes glowed. Without even thinking about it, he leaned down and kissed her.</p> <p>He hadn\u2019t kissed her since they\u2019d left the hotel room. He didn\u2019t know why\u2014was he nervous to do it in public? Did they have some sort of tacit agreement that all of that had been left behind in room 1624 of the Fairmont? Whatever the reason, it was clearly a stupid one, because as soon as he kissed her, he wondered why he\u2019d spent all of this time with her today without his hands and lips on her.</p><p>They lay there in the sun, kissing lazily. He touched her like she was made out of precious china, like he couldn\u2019t grab too hard or make any sudden movements. He wanted to throw his leg over her body again, wanted to push her over and roll on top of her, but they were outside in full view of hundreds of people, and she was a public servant, after all. So instead, he kept up the long, slow kisses, the gentle touches on her arm, her neck, her back, and hoped she was as frustrated as he was.</p><p>Eventually, she pulled away and rested her head on his chest. He wrote his name on the small of her back with his thumb.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cAfter five,\u201d he said after checking his phone. Too late.</p> <p>\u201cYou know.\u201d He\u2019d just realized something. \u201cMy flight is out of the Oakland airport, so I can drop you off at home in Berkeley on the way to the airport. If you want, I mean.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure that my flight is from Oakland, or that I can take you home? Either way, the answer is yes.\u201d</p><p>She pulled his head down to hers and kissed him again.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds great,\u201d she said, and rested her head back on his chest.</p> <p>\u201cDo you want to get some ice cream on the way back to the car?\u201d she asked him a few minutes later, her voice muffled, her hand on the bare skin of his hip, right above the waistband of his jeans.</p><p>\u201cWhat does \u2018ice cream\u2019 mean exactly in this context?\u201d He pulled back to see her face, to check if he made her smile.</p><p>He did.</p><p>\u201cI mean ice cream ice cream!\u201d She pinched him, and he laughed. \u201cThere\u2019s a great place right down the hill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He was willing to go wherever she wanted. \u201cLet\u2019s go get ice cream.\u201d</p><p>She hooked her finger under his chin, pulled him down to her for another kiss, and stood up. After they tucked the towel back into her purse and tossed the remnants of their burritos, they walked back down the hill hand in hand to stand in line for ice cream.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s good here?\u201d he asked her. The burrito had been hours ago at this point, and all of the ice cream flavors looked great to him.</p><p>\u201cWell, my favorite is the salted caramel, but I also love the coffee toffee. And I always love cookies and cream.\u201d She was so animated when she talked about the ice cream that it made him excited about what was coming next. She was like that about everything she cared about, it seemed.</p> <p>He wondered how she would talk about him.</p><p>He moved closer to her and hoped their closeness had the same effect on her as it did on him. She shivered. He smiled.</p><p>\u201cAll of those sound great,\u201d he said. The line ahead of them moved, and they moved up. He stood behind her and massaged her neck. She sighed and leaned back against him.</p><p>\u201cWhy, exactly, did you wait until now to let me know you could do that? You could have been doing that this whole time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hold out on you,\u201d he said. He ran his thumb down the middle of her neck, and she let out a low moan. \u201cWe were a little busy with other things, you know.\u201d He kissed her bare shoulder.</p><p>\u201cNext customer in line!\u201d the ice-cream lady shouted at them.</p><p>\u201cSalted caramel in a cone, please,\u201d Alexa said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you?\u201d the woman behind the counter said to him as she packed ice cream into a waffle cone.</p><p>\u201cUm . . .\u201d He\u2019d stared at the menu all that time they\u2019d been in line, but he\u2019d been distracted by Alexa\u2019s closeness and had barely paid attention. \u201cCookies and cream?\u201d</p><p>They walked slowly back to the car after they got their ice cream, sharing bites with each other.</p><p>He drove them across the bridge and followed her directions to a side street off Alcatraz Avenue. The conversation stalled as they got closer and closer to her house. He looked down and saw her hands clasped together, her nails digging into her knuckles.</p><p>\u201cSo, this is me.\u201d She pointed at a little yellow house. He pulled up in a spot in front of it and hesitated for second before he turned off the car and got out. He pulled her bag out of the trunk and walked up to her front door.</p><p>She unlocked the door, and he followed her inside. They walked through a long hallway covered in photographs and into a big living room. A plush yellow sofa lined one wall, covered with bright cushions. It was flanked by fat red chairs and faced a big wall-mounted TV. Magazines and nail polish covered the coffee table, and overstuffed bookshelves lined the walls. It suited her. Bright, attractive, warm. He wanted to flop down on that couch and curl up with her.</p><p>\u201cWhere should I put this?\u201d he asked, gesturing to the bag.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She paused. Her eyes darted from her bag to his face, then back to her bag. \u201cMy bedroom is easiest, probably.\u201d</p><p>The afternoon light streamed into her bedroom and lit up the pale yellow walls, the big unmade bed with its green and white striped comforter, the vase full of drooping daffodils on the low bookshelf. He dropped the bag on the floor and turned to her. She had that big smile back on her face. The fake one she\u2019d given Amy and Bill.</p><p>\u201cI had a great time this weekend,\u201d she said. Even though he knew, he knew she\u2019d had a great time, that smile made him unsure.</p><p>Screw it.</p><p>He cleared the two feet separating them in one step and pinned her against the wall. Her arms went around his neck, pulling him even closer to her.</p><p>\u201cI know you did,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you know I did, too.\u201d</p><p>He slid one hand up her body and enjoyed her sharp intake of breath when he got to that spot she liked. Her lips parted and her eyes followed his hand. He pulled her dress and bra down. He needed to touch her, without anything in between them. Her fingers tightened on his shoulders. Oh yeah, he knew she\u2019d had a great time this weekend.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have to go to the airport?\u201d Her voice was hoarse.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drive fast,\u201d he said. The hand that wasn\u2019t on her breast skimmed her knee and slid up her thigh under her dress. He kept going up, and then stopped, surprised.</p><p>\u201cHave you been walking around all day with no panties on like this?\u201d Without waiting for an answer, he pressed a finger inside of her and she cried out. She leaned her head back against the wall and closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cTell me, Alexa,\u201d he said. She kept making those noises that he couldn\u2019t get enough of. \u201cHave you been like this all day without telling me? When we were in the park, lying in the grass, could I have done this as easily then?\u201d</p><p>She opened her eyes a sliver and smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t\u201d\u2014she gasped\u2014\u201cpack extra panties yesterday. I didn\u2019t know I was going to sleep over. What was I supposed to do?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He groaned.</p><p>\u201cIf I had known that, I would have pulled that dress up long before we left the park. You are evil.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and gasped all at the same time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get you back for that sometime,\u201d he said. \u201cJust not right now.\u201d He fell to his knees. Her fingers slid through his hair. All at once, her fingernails clenched against his scalp, and her whole body relaxed.</p> <p>\u201cMy turn.\u201d He stood up, pulled a condom out of his pocket, and pinned her arms against the wall over her head. \u201cHold on.\u201d</p><p>He was so turned on from what had just happened, from the thought of her without underwear on all day, from those little noises she made, that he had no finesse. He heard the wall creak and the light fixtures shake, saw her breasts jiggle, felt her writhe beneath him and clench around him.</p><p>Her leg slid down his body, her arms fell around his waist, and they stood there, quiet and shuddering for a few minutes until their breathing slowed. God, her body felt good against his.</p><p>He kissed her cheek, her lips, and leaned his forehead against hers.</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t planned that, but I\u2019m not going to pretend I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p> <p>She laughed. He had maybe gotten addicted to that laugh. There was always so much joy in it. At the wedding, he\u2019d heard her laugh from across the room a few times and each time had wanted to rush to her side to enjoy it. A few times he had.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sorry, either. But . . . and I hate to say this . . . shouldn\u2019t you head to the airport?\u201d</p><p>He moved away from her reluctantly and pulled his pants up. He grabbed his phone out of his pocket to check the time.</p><p>\u201cShit. Yeah, damn it.\u201d</p><p>She adjusted her dress as he buckled his belt, and they walked to her front door. She reached out to open the door, but he pushed it closed.</p><p>\u201cDrew, you have to\u2014\u201d</p> <p>He reached for her.</p><p>\u201cI know. I just have to do this first.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her, long and slow. He felt her relax against him and wanted to forget about going to the airport. He wanted to pick her up, get in that cozy-looking bed with her, and have a few more rounds, then tuck her against his side all night long. He pulled away from her with a sigh.</p><p>She kissed him on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad I got stuck in that elevator with you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>After one last hard kiss on her lips, he raced out to the car and peeled away toward the freeway. Alexa collapsed against her front door, almost unable to believe what had just happened. What had happened over the past forty-eight hours.</p><p>She stumbled back to her bedroom and flopped on her bed, the stripes of her duvet cover blurring as she stared at it. Thirty minutes later she was in the same spot. She sat up and tried to pull herself together.</p> <p>She\u2019d known from the beginning that it was just one weekend and she\u2019d never hear from him again. And it was a great weekend, punctuated by some very hot against-the-wall sex at the end there\u2014she would never look at her bedroom wall the same way\u2014so she should be cheerful, not maudlin. Alexa, snap out of it.</p><p>Her phone buzzed, and she reached for it, expecting it to be another text from Maddie.</p><p>Made my flight by the skin of my teeth!</p><p>She could feel that dreamy smile back on her face. Oh, the hell with it. She allowed herself that night to swoon and mope about this weekend before falling back to earth.</p><p>She texted back before she could overthink her response.</p><p>:) Glad you made it!</p><p>She should call Maddie and update her. Maddie had forced her to go through with the fake date in the first place, after all. She had to thank her for getting her to break her celibacy streak in an impressive fashion.</p><p>But not yet. Right now she needed to hug this whole weekend close to her chest and hold on to it tight before sharing it with anyone.</p><p>She puttered around the house, changed out of the dress he\u2019d almost torn off her and into yoga pants and a tank top (and underwear), unloaded her dishwasher, went through the rest of the work emails that had come in this weekend, and made a to-do list for the workweek.</p><p>But all the time she thought about Drew. The way he\u2019d laughed whenever she\u2019d laughed; the way he kept touching her, like his hands belonged on her skin; the way he\u2019d smiled at her in the middle of the night like he was so happy to have her there with him in his bed; the way he ate his burrito with tortilla chips as utensils and blushed when she teased him about it.</p><p>The whole time she hoped she\u2019d get another text from him after he landed, or after he got home, but her phone stayed silent. She thought about texting him again, but what was she supposed to say? Had a great time having sex with you this weekend, can\u2019t stop thinking about it was all she could think of, and that was a little too on the nose.</p><p>To keep herself occupied, she finally texted Maddie.</p><p>Fine you were right. Broke my streak with elevator guy. Sorry I didn\u2019t check in before, was occupied with him all weekend ;) Going to bed now &amp; turning off my phone, but I\u2019ll give you all the details asap.</p><p>Hopefully that was breezy enough that it didn\u2019t show she\u2019d been moping over him for the past two hours. Maybe by the time she woke up the next day she would actually feel like that.</p><p>She didn\u2019t turn off her phone, of course. She left it on all night, hoping he would text again. Which meant she saw Maddie\u2019s exclamation-point-filled response, but there was nothing else from Drew.</p><p>When she rolled out of bed the next morning, she groaned. She was so sore all over that it felt like she\u2019d gone to the world\u2019s hardest yoga class right after running a 10K and right before a weight-lifting competition. Nope, just hours of athletic sex in all sorts of crazy positions.</p><p>She grinned in the hot shower; despite the body aches, she felt a lot better this morning than she had last night. She laughed when she saw finger-shaped bruises on her shoulders and hips and hickeys on her breasts. What was she, twenty-two? Except . . . she\u2019d never had sex that good when she was twenty-two. She whistled as she pulled her robe on and started the coffee maker, and took three Advil along with her first sip of coffee.</p><p>She threw on a boatnecked long-sleeved shift dress that covered up all of her sex-related injuries and headed to work. Her boss always got in late on Monday mornings, thank God, so she would have a few hours of relative peace in the office to start the week.</p><p>Well, she got an hour of peace, until Maddie called at nine on the dot.</p><p>\u201cYou were going to call me when, exactly?\u201d</p><p>She laughed and closed her office door.</p><p>Drew walked into the hospital that Monday morning and jumped into the elevator right before it closed, only to find his friend and fellow doctor Carlos Ibarra part of the crowd inside.</p><p>\u201cJust the dude I was looking for,\u201d Carlos said. \u201cHow was the wedding?\u201d</p><p>A hell of a lot better than he\u2019d thought it was going to be, that was for sure. Drew smirked.</p><p>Carlos\u2019s eyebrows went up and he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cOf course. Why would I have thought anything less of you?\u201d</p><p>Drew noticed the interested glances sent their way and gave Carlos a warning look. Carlos, of course, exaggeratedly zipped his lips. Always discreet, that one.</p><p>They got off on the tenth floor, and Carlos followed him to his office, shutting the door behind them.</p><p>\u201cOkay, now you can tell me. Found a woman in the elevator and spent all weekend banging her, huh?\u201d</p><p>Drew relaxed into his desk chair and turned on his computer.</p><p>\u201cNot quite all weekend.\u201d He grinned again.</p><p>Carlos sat in the chair on the other side of his desk.</p><p>\u201cOh God, leave it to you. I can\u2019t believe you picked up someone in an elevator and made her your plus-one to your ex\u2019s wedding.\u201d</p><p>Drew grimaced.</p><p>\u201cOh, it was even worse. I forgot to tell you: I accidentally told Josh she was my girlfriend, so . . .\u201d</p><p>Carlos leaned back in the chair.</p><p>\u201cYou, a girlfriend? So she had to fake it all night? How did you get her to do that?\u201d</p><p>Drew grinned.</p><p>\u201cJust my natural charm, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Carlos\u2019s phone buzzed and he glanced at it.</p><p>\u201cOh, I bet everyone at the wedding grilled the poor girl. I hope she was up to the pretense.\u201d</p><p>Was she ever. Man, he really couldn\u2019t have picked a better person to be stuck in an elevator with, could he? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe works in politics, so she\u2019s good at stuff like that.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been good at a lot of things.

He had a feeling he\u2019d be thinking about the sex he\u2019d had with Alexa for at least a few days.</p> <p>\u201cSorry, but you asked about her. One thought led to another, and . . .\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m only human.\u201d</p><p>Carlos stood up and opened Drew\u2019s top desk drawer to grab some of the candy out of it.</p><p>\u201cWell, at least you had an ironclad excuse for getting out of there early yesterday. I know how you are with women. Good thing you had to get back here for that golf thing.\u201d</p><p>Oh shit, the golf tournament.</p><p>Carlos laughed at the look on Drew\u2019s face.</p> <p>\u201cWhat, did you get home and then bail on the golf tournament? Too tired from elevator girl?\u201d</p><p>Drew sighed.</p><p>\u201cSee, what had happened was . . .\u201d</p><p>Carlos laughed. \u201cOh shit, now this is getting good. Go on.\u201d Carlos leaned back and propped his feet up on Drew\u2019s desk.</p><p>He was going to get so much shit for this, but now he\u2019d said too much to not tell the whole story. Carlos would get it out of him eventually anyway.</p><p>\u201cI kind of changed my flight to last night. And I forgot all about the golf tournament . . . so, that\u2019s what happened. More or less.\u201d</p> <p>Carlos took his feet down and stared at Drew.</p><p>\u201cYou changed your flight? To hang out with elevator girl?\u201d</p><p>Drew shrugged and leaned back in his chair, trying to play it off.</p><p>\u201cYou know I hate golf. The tournament was just an excuse to get out of there, but once I had Alexa, I didn\u2019t need an excuse anymore.\u201d</p><p>He twitched under Carlos\u2019s gaze. His phone buzzed, and he glanced over at it\u2014just an update on a patient. Carlos snatched his phone before he could pull it away.</p><p>\u201cOoh, her name was Alexa, huh? Is that Alexa texting you?\u201d</p><p>Drew stood up and reached over the desk for his phone.</p><p>\u201cAlexa Monroe. And no, as you can see, it wasn\u2019t her.\u201d Carlos handed him back the phone with a wide grin on his face. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlexa Monroe. You like this girl.\u201d</p><p>Drew shrugged again, pretending that he didn\u2019t know what Carlos meant.</p><p>\u201cSure, of course I liked her. We had a great time this weekend.\u201d</p><p>Carlos shook his head, still grinning.</p><p>\u201cNo, you like her like her. You wanted that to be a text from her\u2014you know you did. You should have heard your voice when you said her name and said it wasn\u2019t from her. You wanted her to text you!\u201d</p><p>Drew shook his head then gave up. Carlos would just keep pushing until he admitted it, anyway.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be mad or anything if she texted me. But she lives in Berkeley, remember? And I live here? In Santa Monica?\u201d</p><p>Carlos reached for Drew\u2019s coffee, took a sip, and grimaced.</p><p>\u201cSo, let me get this straight. You met a great girl this weekend. You had fun with her, you liked her . . . Is she ugly? Was the sex bad?\u201d</p><p>Drew smirked again. He didn\u2019t mean to. But hell no to both of those things.</p><p>\u201cI can see your answer. To recap: you met a great girl, you had fun with her, you liked her, she\u2019s cute, the sex was good.\u201d</p><p>Drew nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnd . . . you\u2019re just never going to see her again?\u201d</p><p>Hmmm. When you put it that way, it didn\u2019t make much sense.</p><p>\u201cThat was the plan, I guess so, yeah.\u201d</p><p>Carlos stood up.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such an asshole. I know you\u2019re weird about commitment and all, but this is taking it a little far. Text Alexa Monroe. Figure out when you\u2019re going to see her again. Don\u2019t be an idiot. I mean even more of one than you already are.\u201d Carlos left his office and then ruined his exit by poking his head back in. \u201cHoops at six?\u201d</p><p>Drew nodded as Carlos walked out, glad he\u2019d remembered to throw his gym bag in the car this morning. Their Monday basketball game would be a good way to get out some of his aggressions from this conversation, where Carlos had somehow gotten the best of him without even trying.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t like he hadn\u2019t thought about texting her again. He had wanted to text her when he\u2019d gotten in bed when he got home, when he stopped on the way to work this morning to pick up coffee and was sure she\u2019d already had some, when he saw a billboard for some new fast-food breakfast sandwich and laughed. But he\u2019d held off, because he figured they\u2019d tacitly agreed that this weekend, as great as it was, was all they\u2019d have. But Carlos had a point.</p><p>He reached for his phone. Oh, the hell with it. They could at least have another weekend.</p><p>Maybe this is crazy, but I have lots of frequent flier miles. Feel like a trip to LA this weekend?</p><p>He didn\u2019t let himself think about it and pressed send.</p><p>By the time she got off the phone with Maddie, the mayor was in, and she only had time for a brief check-in with Theo before he pulled all of the senior staff into their Monday morning meeting.</p><p>After they finished regular business, the mayor looked at her.</p><p>\u201cAlexa, you\u2019re going to get me a memo on our plan forward with that delinquent teen project. End of the week?\u201d</p><p>She locked eyes with Theo across the table from her. He wanted a memo. That was way more than she\u2019d anticipated from his brush-off at their meeting on Friday.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d she said to her boss.</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d The mayor stood up, and the rest of the room did, too. \u201cGood work, people. Theo, one more question for you . . .\u201d</p><p>He and Theo walked out of the room, deep in conversation about a reporter that the mayor was trying to get on their side, while Alexa stood there stunned.</p><p>She was halfway there. Sure, she would have to write the best memo she\u2019d ever written, but she didn\u2019t even think he would want that. Granted, just because he was ready to read another memo didn\u2019t mean he was ready to throw his weight behind the idea, but it meant he was close.</p><p>And she really needed to get him to stop calling it a \u201cdelinquent teen project.\u201d She\u2019d thought she\u2019d made it clear when they met that the correct terminology was \u201cat-risk youth.\u201d But in the grand scheme of things, that was not a big deal.</p><p>She walked back to her office, glad she\u2019d made a quick outline of her arguments on her phone in the middle of the night once when she couldn\u2019t sleep. She reached for her phone to read it over. And that\u2019s when she saw the text from Drew.</p><p>She looked over her shoulder. Was she being filmed? Was this a dream? Was this some kind of \u201cThis is Alexa\u2019s lucky day!\u201d fake reality TV show? Her boss was in on her pet project, a hot guy wanted to fly her to L.A.\u2014was she going to get an email with a $1,000 gift card to Sephora next?</p><p>He\u2019d sent it two hours ago. Right when she was telling Maddie that she was sure she\u2019d never hear from him again.</p><p>Shit, what should she say? YES, OF COURSE was what she wanted to say, but that would be kind of desperate and needy, right? She checked her boss\u2019s calendar: he was at his niece\u2019s wedding in Tahoe that weekend. And he\u2019d wanted her memo by Friday anyway, so work shouldn\u2019t be in her way. But still, shouldn\u2019t she . . .</p><p>She heard Maddie\u2019s voice in her head telling her not to overthink it.</p><p>She texted him back.</p><p>Sure, why not?</p><p>She wanted to take it back almost immediately. What the hell was she doing? Wasting another weekend on this guy? Just because she\u2019d be done with the\u2014damn it, now she could only think of it as the \u201cdelinquent teens\u201d memo\u2014by Friday didn\u2019t mean that she wouldn\u2019t have a ton of other work to do. She\u2019d have to do all the work that she wouldn\u2019t get to bring home every night this week because she\u2019d be working on the memo.</p><p>And when was she going to find time to pack? For a weekend in L.A.? Oh God, she was going to have to go shopping again. She didn\u2019t have time to go shopping again! And what if he wanted to go to the beach? Would she have to wear a swimming suit? Didn\u2019t he know what she looked like in a swimming suit? Maybe this was all a joke and she\u2019d never hear from him again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Great, I\u2019ll check flights.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re not spinning around in your office chair,\u201d Theo said, standing at her office door.</p><p>She jumped.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know I had something to be spinning about?\u201d</p> <p>Theo plopped into the chair on the other side of her desk.</p><p>\u201cUm, because I was sitting right there when he said he wanted the memo?\u201d</p><p>The memo, right. That\u2019s what he was talking about.</p><p>\u201cOh. Yeah, right, I was thinking of . . . something else.\u201d</p><p>Theo paused mid-reach toward her candy jar.</p> <p>\u201cWait a minute. What could you possibly be thinking about other than your project?\u201d He looked from Alexa\u2019s face to her phone. \u201cWho\u2019s the guy?\u201d</p><p>She tried to hold back her smile and failed.</p><p>\u201cUm. Close the door.\u201d</p><p>Theo jumped up to close the door and was back at her desk in seconds.</p><p>\u201cTalk. We can talk about the memo in a second. I don\u2019t have another meeting for\u201d\u2014he looked at his watch\u2014\u201cforty-five minutes. Go.\u201d</p><p>She rooted through her candy jar to find a Jolly Rancher.</p> <p>\u201cSoooo, funny story . . .\u201d</p><p>Some people might say Drew\u2019s terrible mood during those two hours after he\u2019d texted Alexa was because he\u2019d convinced himself she wasn\u2019t going to write back. After ten minutes of nothing, he\u2019d decided that her gentle way of letting him down would be to never answer, and his desperation would be out there floating in the wind forever.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t why he\u2019d been in such a bad mood, he insisted to himself, and then to Carlos, when he stopped by on the way to get more coffee. It was just because of those irritating parents he had to deal with this morning. Carlos didn\u2019t believe him. He didn\u2019t really believe himself either.</p><p>It was kind of amazing how little he cared about those irritating parents after Alexa texted back, though.</p><p>In the middle of their tame text conversation about flight times, he ventured a suggestion.</p><p>You gonna show up to the flight without panties like yesterday?</p><p>Her reply came back within seconds.</p><p>Maybe.</p> <p>He grinned down at his phone.</p><p>Friday morning, he tried to convince himself the spring in his step was only because his apartment was spotless for the first time in months, thanks to the emergency visit from a house cleaner. Carlos was at the clinic all day, not the main hospital, so there was no one there to argue that point with him.</p><p>All he had that day were some appointments in the morning and assisting Dr. Montgomery on a surgery for four-year-old Jack, one of Drew\u2019s favorite patients. He\u2019d been hit by a car about a month ago, and one of his bones wasn\u2019t healing right. Throughout it all, the kid had been a trooper, and his parents had been attentive and thoughtful.</p><p>But Jack\u2019s surgery got pushed back. From noon to two. Then at one thirty, word came from Dr. Montgomery\u2019s office that it was going to be at least another hour, maybe two. Drew dropped by the waiting room to check on Jack and his parents. Jack was playing happily on the floor with a pile of Legos.</p><p>\u201cDr. Nick! Look what I did!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Jack, good job. Hey, Abby, Fred, how are you guys holding up?\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s mom, Abby, looked up at him and shrugged as she helped Jack pull apart two blue Legos.</p><p>\u201cHanging in there, but we thought we\u2019d be done by now.\u201d</p><p>Drew sighed.</p><p>\u201cYeah, me, too. Dr. Montgomery had an emergency. I\u2019m so sorry about this.\u201d</p><p>The frustrating thing was that Drew could have done the surgery alone, but Dr. Montgomery had taken an interest in the case, and it\u2019s not like he could tell the parents, Oh no, don\u2019t wait for the expert, he\u2019s not worth it.</p><p>\u201cThey told us,\u201d Abby said. \u201cAt least they let us feed him a little once it got pushed back, otherwise this would be even more of a nightmare.\u201d</p><p>Drew was grateful he\u2019d sent word to the nurses to get Jack some food; sometimes you had to relax the \u201cno eating before surgery\u201d rules with kids.</p><p>\u201cCan I get you two anything?\u201d Drew asked them. \u201cCoffee, tea, water?\u201d</p><p>Fred smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Dr. Nichols. I went on a coffee run, so we\u2019re good. Thanks for checking on us. We appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>When he finally got word that Dr. Montgomery was out of his emergency surgery, he did a quick mental calculation and realized there was no way he was going to be on time to pick up Alexa from the airport. Now he\u2019d be late, she\u2019d be sitting at LAX\u2014possibly without panties on\u2014getting more and more frustrated, and the whole weekend would be fucked up.</p><p>Damn it. He called Carlos.</p><p>\u201cHey man, I need a huge favor.\u201d</p><p>Carlos was clearly in the car; Drew could hear the air whistling through the windows.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be getting ready for Alexa?\u201d Carlos asked.</p><p>Why was he friends with such a jackass?</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s the thing. My surgery got pushed back, so I\u2019m going to be stuck here for a while. Can you pick her up from the airport and bring her to my apartment? You have my keys, right? I\u2019ll owe you in beer for the next two months.\u201d</p><p>He could hear Carlos\u2019s car shut off, and he got switched off speakerphone.</p><p>\u201cNo problem, man. Text me her flight info and how I can find her. Or should I just take all of the short black women with big boobs at LAX to your apartment so you can pick?\u201d</p><p>Drew lay his head down on his desk.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to regret this, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no doubt, you absolutely are. Good luck with the surgery!\u201d</p><p>Drew texted Alexa the change of plans. Hopefully, she wouldn\u2019t be pissed. She knew he was a doctor, so it would be okay. Right?</p><p>Alexa had given her boss two hard copies and an email version of her memo right before he walked out the door on Friday afternoon. She\u2019d barely slept all week, between her regular work, texting Drew, writing and editing the memo every night, thinking about Drew, and, oh yeah, stressing about the upcoming weekend. Thursday night, she\u2019d made her last edits on the memo, after copious notes from Theo, and had packed probably way too many clothes for a weekend trip to L.A.</p><p>She slipped into the bathroom at work right before leaving for the airport, stepped out of her underwear, and tucked them into the bottom of her tote bag. When she came out of the stall, she couldn\u2019t even look herself in the eye in the mirror.</p><p>She sang along to her girl-power playlist in the car on the way to the airport, which helped to psych herself up. But the text from Drew brought her down to earth.</p><p>My surgery got pushed back so I\u2019m running late. My buddy Carlos is going to pick you up and bring you to my apartment. He drives a red BMW his number is 310-555-4827 if you can\u2019t find him, but he\u2019s got your number too.</p><p>Huh. He was a doctor; these things happened. But she felt so deflated. Now she had no real idea when she was going to get to see him tonight. How long was this surgery supposed to last? Was she supposed to just tuck herself in his bed and wait for him? Thank God she\u2019d thrown her yoga pants in her suitcase. And brought her laptop.</p><p>And the friend picking her up had a red BMW? Oh God, he was going to be one of those fancy car assholes, wasn\u2019t he? Welcome to L.A.</p><p>She forced herself to put together a weekend work to-do list while on the flight. When she read it over, she saw she\u2019d repeated three different things. Too distracted for more work, she pulled a fashion magazine out of her bag and updated her Sephora wish list, just in case that dream gift certificate actually came.</p><p>When her flight landed, she had texts from both Maddie and Theo, wishing her luck (Maddie) and asking a work question (Theo). And one from a 310 number:</p><p>Hey Alexa, Drew\u2019s friend Carlos here. Picking you up bc he can\u2019t. Look for the red car. See you soon.</p><p>She wished tone came through easier on text messages. Was this guy the asshole that the red sports car would make him seem? And, oh God, had Drew told him the same girlfriend story he\u2019d given the people at the wedding, or did he know the real story? She couldn\u2019t even ask Drew because he was in surgery. She\u2019d just have to play it by ear.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, Alexa stood outside and realized one of the big differences between Northern and Southern California: a lot more red sports cars in Southern California. She smiled tentatively at each one, but so far she was 0 for 5 as they sped by. Or maybe Drew hadn\u2019t described her and Carlos was looking for one of those tall, blond, skinny women like she\u2019d seen in the bathroom at the wedding? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She looked down at the phone gripped in her hand to see if maybe Carlos had texted again without her noticing, or maybe Drew had finished his surgery and sped over from the hospital.</p><p>\u201cAlexa?\u201d She looked up, and a red car was parked at the curb in front of her, a tall Latino guy getting out of the driver\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cCarlos? Hi! It\u2019s nice to meet you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cLikewise.\u201d He opened the passenger door for her and put her suitcase in the trunk. She settled into his car, then sat bolt upright. She really should have stopped in the bathroom and put her underwear back on.</p> <p>He grinned at her once they were both in the car. Did he know what she was thinking? Did guys tell one another stories like that? She had no idea.</p><p>\u201cSorry if you had to wait,\u201d he said. \u201cI checked your flight info online, and you weren\u2019t supposed to land until right now.\u201d</p><p>They were already on their way out of the airport, dodging cars and rental car shuttles. He definitely drove like a guy driving a red sports car.</p><p>\u201cOh my goodness, it\u2019s no problem,\u201d she said. \u201cThank you so much for coming to pick me up. I really appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>He threw a smile in her direction before pulling out of the airport.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Drew\u2019s going to owe me big for this one. By the way, are you hungry? I have no idea when he\u2019s going to be done, and I don\u2019t want you to starve waiting for him. Want to pick something up on the way to his place?\u201d</p><p>She set her tote bag down on the floor next to her feet, grateful that he\u2019d asked. Maybe this guy was nicer than she\u2019d assumed. She\u2019d stress-eaten all of her purse snacks over the course of the workweek and hadn\u2019t had time to eat anything today except for a salad at noon and a bag of peanuts on the airplane.</p><p>\u201cI would love that, thank you. As long as it\u2019s not out of your way?\u201d Oh God, she thought, please don\u2019t let him say it\u2019s out of his way.</p><p>He laughed and turned down the radio.</p><p>\u201cTons of stuff in between here and there. Plus I\u2019m hungry, too. Drew didn\u2019t give me much warning here.\u201d</p><p>She pulled off her cardigan and put it in her bag.</p> <p>\u201cSame here.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her as he changed lanes.</p><p>\u201cThis was a last-minute thing\u2014Drew couldn\u2019t have helped it. But he was definitely looking forward to you coming.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. That was nice of Carlos to say, but . . . thank goodness he went back to the food topic.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you in the mood for? In-N-Out? Pizza? Tacos? Sush\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTacos, definitely,\u201d she said, almost salivating. She relaxed against the leather seat and let her eyes drift shut for a second. She was suddenly exhausted, from the stress of the week, her sleepless nights, the last few hours of uncertainty.</p><p>\u201cAwesome.\u201d He accelerated and her eyes popped open. She probably should stay alert with him driving like this.</p><p>\u201cOne question before I decide where to get the tacos: how are you with spicy food?\u201d</p> <p>She laughed.</p><p>\u201cI think my mom used to put Tabasco sauce in my bottles as a kid. I can take anything you\u2019re dishing out.\u201d</p><p>He changed lanes with barely a glance over his shoulder and grinned.</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d</p><p>Thirty minutes later, she carried their food up the stairs to Drew\u2019s apartment, while Carlos brought her suitcase. After he opened the door, she walked inside to see big windows, white walls, chrome appliances, and black-and-white prints everywhere. She dropped her tote bag next to the gray couch and looked around for a place to put the tacos.</p><p>\u201cPut them on the coffee table,\u201d Carlos said. \u201cThe game\u2019s on. I\u2019ll get napkins and beer.\u201d</p><p>Alexa kicked off her shoes and left them in the corner by her suitcase. She wanted to change into her yoga pants and a T-shirt, instead of the sleek red shift dress she\u2019d worn to work that day. But it felt awkward to wheel her stuff into Drew\u2019s bedroom like she belonged there and change into her comfy clothes. She didn\u2019t even know where Drew\u2019s bedroom was.</p><p>The spread of tacos Carlos laid out on the table distracted her.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, that looks so good,\u201d she said. She\u2019d tried to pay for them, but he\u2019d pushed her wallet aside. To be fair, he\u2019d ordered for her, too.</p><p>He turned on the basketball game and plopped in the easy chair. Thank goodness Drew had an ugly throw blanket draped over the back of his couch. She sat in a corner, put the blanket over her lap, and tucked her feet up with a sigh of relief.</p><p>\u201cThese are so good,\u201d she couldn\u2019t stop saying as they ate. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we have potato tacos at every taqueria in the Bay Area? I\u2019m going to be angry about that for months, if not years.\u201d She poured more of the habanero salsa over her taco.</p><p>Carlos added another taco to his plate and laughed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can get potato tacos anytime you come down to visit.\u201d</p><p>How was she supposed to answer that? She doubted if she\u2019d ever be back to visit Drew. Anything she said to his friend about that would either be presumptuous or needy. So instead, she added a dollop of guacamole to her taco and took a bite.</p><p>She grabbed a carnitas taco next, and reached for one of the salsas that she hadn\u2019t tried yet.</p><p>\u201cOh no.\u201d Carlos took it away from her and handed her a container of the tomatillo salsa. \u201cTry this one. That one I got for poor Drew. He can\u2019t do too much spice.\u201d</p><p>She raised her eyebrows at him and opened her mouth, then thought better of what she was about to say.</p><p>\u201cI know what you were going to say,\u201d Carlos said. \u201cIt\u2019s a trial having a white dude as a best friend, but I\u2019ve been working on him.\u201d</p><p>They both burst out laughing and dug back in to the food.</p><p>Drew heard Alexa\u2019s laugh from the other side of his apartment door. It made him smile, the way it had ever since her first laugh in the elevator. He opened the door to see her sitting with Carlos, both with plates of tacos from Carlos\u2019s favorite taqueria on their laps. Carlos must approve if he\u2019d brought her there. They were laughing so hard they didn\u2019t notice him at first.</p><p>Hold on. Why was Carlos still here? He hadn\u2019t told him to entertain her, just to drop her off at his apartment and let her in.</p><p>He wanted to sit next to her on his couch, kiss her, tell her how hot she looked in that dress, see her smile at him, maybe reach up under her dress to check her underwear situation. Instead, she was laughing with his best friend and hadn\u2019t even heard him open the door.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d was all he said.</p><p>She looked up and smiled at him, just the way he\u2019d wanted her to. He smiled back, so happy to see her that he had to take a step back.</p><p>\u201cYou get me any tacos?\u201d he asked Carlos. \u201cI see you\u2019re drinking my beer.\u201d</p><p>Carlos gestured to the table but made no move to leave.</p><p>\u201cTacos for everyone, and I even remembered your favorite salsa. There\u2019s more beer in the fridge.\u201d</p><p>Drew went into the kitchen for a beer. At least there\u2019d been a third plate on the table, so apparently Carlos hadn\u2019t completely forgotten that Drew existed.</p><p>He sat on the couch next to Alexa and took a swig of his beer. She turned to face him, her smile more tentative now. He reached for her hand, and she gripped his fingers for a second.</p><p>\u201cYou must be starving,\u201d she said. She let go of his hand but moved closer to him on the couch. \u201cHave some tacos. How did the surgery go?\u201d</p><p>He loaded up his plate and moved closer to her in the process, so by the time he sat back against the couch cushions they were hip to hip. Carlos was intent on the basketball game, but he had a tiny smirk on his face. He knew Drew was dying to get rid of him, damn him.</p><p>He took a bite, realized he hadn\u2019t answered her question, tried to talk, then saw the error in that. She laughed at him, and he grinned once he could.</p><p>\u201cSurgery went well. This is that kid I was telling you about last weekend, the one who was in the car accident.\u201d He took another bite, happy that she was relaxed against him. \u201cSorry that I couldn\u2019t pick you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she said. She wiped her hands with a paper towel and set her plate back down on the table. \u201cWill you need to go into the hospital this weekend to check on him?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He paused, a taco halfway toward his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI kind of wanted to.

Great to meet you, too.\u201d</p><p>Well, wasn\u2019t that cozy.</p><p>The door closed behind Carlos a few seconds later, and when Alexa sat back down next to Drew on the couch, he put his plate on the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said. He\u2019d been dying for Carlos to leave, so why did it feel awkward now? Why did he feel like this? He was never nervous around women.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d She smiled back at him. But her hands were clasped together tightly again. It made him feel better that she was nervous, too.</p><p>\u201cSorry I couldn\u2019t pick you up,\u201d he said again. His hand moved up into her hair, and he rubbed his fingers through the strands.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d She turned so her whole body was facing his. Her hands let go of each other, and one of them came to rest on his thigh.</p><p>He moved his hand from her hair to her cheek. She closed her eyes and leaned her face into his palm. They sat like that in silence for a minute or so.</p><p>Finally, she opened her eyes and looked at him, a dreamy smile on her lips. His hand moved from her cheek to her chin, and he lowered his head to hers.</p><p>It had been less than a week, but her lips on his, his arms wrapped around her, her hands in his hair, it all felt like coming home after months away. Like all he needed was this, the gentle pressure of her lips, the soft strokes of her tongue, her touches and sighs, to make him happy.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t wait for Carlos to leave,\u201d she said against his ear.</p><p>He laughed and relaxed back on the couch, pulling her with him. She leaned her head on his chest, and he ran his fingers through her hair.</p><p>\u201cHe was doing that to fuck with me\u2014I know it\u2014but I was so ready to kill him.\u201d He ran his hand down from her hip to her knee over her dress. He paused and slid his hand back up, under her dress this time.</p><p>\u201cDid you . . .\u201d</p><p>Her wide smile was all the answer he needed. In a flash, he pressed her down on the couch and braced his body over hers.</p> <p>\u201cDid you plan on telling me this at some point?\u201d He ran his hand up the outside of her leg again, this time pushing her dress up along with it.</p><p>She smiled again from beneath him as she caressed his chest, unbuttoning his shirt as she went.</p><p>\u201cYou seemed to like the surprise so much last time, I didn\u2019t want to spoil it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmm. I liked the surprise last time a LOT, that\u2019s true.\u201d He pushed her legs apart with his knee while she unbuckled his belt.</p><p>He kissed her again, harder this time. His thumb ran over her breasts, and she moaned as she kissed him back. She ran her hands up under his shirt. He never wanted her to stop touching him.</p><p>Fuck. Condoms were all in his bedroom.</p><p>\u201cHold that thought.\u201d He stood up, pushing the coffee table out of the way. One of the containers of salsa spilled everywhere. He couldn\u2019t care less. He looked down at Alexa on his couch, dress crumpled around her waist, hair every which way, and grinned. It had been a GREAT idea to have her come down for the weekend.</p><p>\u201cWait right there. Don\u2019t move, not one millimeter. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d He ran into his bedroom and grabbed a condom out of the box in his nightstand. He ran back into the living room a minute later.</p><p>\u201cYou moved,\u201d he said. She looked up at him, her now-naked body sprawled across his couch.</p><p>\u201cYou left,\u201d she said. \u201cI had to do something to keep myself occupied while I waited for you.\u201d Goddamn, this woman.</p><p>He threw his clothes across the room and crawled up her body.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you want, Alexa,\u201d he said, his naked body suspended over hers.</p><p>\u201cI want you to stop asking me stupid questions,\u201d she said, and pulled him down so he was flush against her.</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>\u201cPoint taken,\u201d he said, and pushed her legs open.</p><p>Later, as they lay together on the couch, he looked at the wreckage of his living room\u2014three couch pillows on the floor, clothes in every corner, salsa everywhere.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to Los Angeles,\u201d he said in her ear. She laughed and turned her face to kiss him.</p><p>Alexa woke up the next morning, her back tucked against his chest, his arms cocooning her. She couldn\u2019t fight the warmth that spread through her chest at the way he held her, the way he touched her. He embraced her like he meant it, like he cared.</p><p>He was probably always just like this with women. She knew it wasn\u2019t real. But damn, did it feel good.</p><p>And then, the times he touched her in other ways . . . holy shit, were those times amazing. What was it about this guy and her reaction to him? She\u2019d never felt so uninhibited around a man before, especially without her clothes on. Her cheeks got hot when she thought about throwing her clothes off on his couch. She hadn\u2019t worried about what he would think of her or the cellulite in her thighs or the way her stomach jiggled or how her boobs drooped\u2014she only thought about his pleasure and her own.</p><p>Last weekend she\u2019d thought that it was because it was a one-night stand, that it was the craziness of the wedding and the champagne and the knowledge that she\u2019d never see him again that made her so relaxed around him. But now . . . maybe it was just something about him. Whatever it was, she was going to enjoy it all weekend.</p><p>She felt him nuzzle the back of her neck and giggled.</p><p>\u201cSo she is awake,\u201d he said, his mouth still on her skin.</p><p>\u201cMmmmhmmm,\u201d she responded, not wanting him to move.</p><p>But then he started to move, his hands and his lips and his tongue, and it turned out that she didn\u2019t mind so much.</p><p>Afterward, she snuggled against him, both of them hot and sweaty and breathless.</p><p>\u201cDrew?\u201d she whispered in his ear.</p><p>She felt him smile against her cheek.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go turn on the coffee in a second.\u201d</p><p>They drank coffee in the sun on his balcony, as they looked out at the ocean, him in boxers, her in a flannel robe she\u2019d found in his bathroom. She took her first long sip and sighed. He looked from his own mug to her.</p><p>\u201cThat was a good sigh, yes?\u201d</p><p>She looked at him, then down at her coffee, so she wouldn\u2019t smile at him too much.</p><p>\u201cGood, yes. You make good coffee.\u201d</p><p>He leaned back in his chair and laughed.</p><p>\u201cA skill I had to learn in med school or get my stomach torn apart by the stuff in the cafeteria.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and took another sip.</p><p>\u201cHey, Alexa?\u201d Drew said, that little-boy smile back on his face. She would probably do whatever he wanted when he smiled at her like that.</p><p>Or any kind of way.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry, too,\u201d was all she said.</p><p>\u201cThe thing is, I don\u2019t really have much food in the house. I was planning on going to the grocery store before picking you up at the airport, but . . .\u201d</p><p>She stood up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll jump in the shower.\u201d</p><p>Drew had noticed Alexa\u2019s sweet tooth at the wedding, so he brought her to a brunch place where everyone raved about the waffles. She ordered them with blueberries on top, and he stole a few tastes in between bites of his omelet and bacon. When they walked back to his car, he realized how close to the hospital they were.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re only about five minutes from the hospital . . . If you want I can drop you at home first, but I was thinking that I could just run in and say hi to Jack?\u201d</p><p>She smiled up at him.</p><p>\u201cSure, of course. You don\u2019t have to just run in, you know. I mean, if you have work to do, I get it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He opened her car door then went around and got in on his side.</p><p>\u201cNo, really, I only want to say hi. I\u2019m not on call this weekend. I don\u2019t want to be that asshole who second-guesses the doctors working that day.\u201d</p><p>He kept looking over at her as he drove the short distance to the hospital. Her eyes were closed as she leaned back in the seat, her hand in his, her thumb lazily stroking his palm. He liked the way she could give herself up to enjoying things like car rides on a sunny day, her morning coffee, lying in the grass at Dolores Park. Being around her made him enjoy all of those things more, too.</p><p>He pulled into the hospital parking lot and squeezed her hand.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. She didn\u2019t take her seat belt off.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t I just wait here? Confidentiality and all? I don\u2019t mind waiting. I have books on my phone.\u201d</p><p>She was only here for the weekend, and he\u2019d already missed time with her the night before.</p><p>\u201cNo, come inside. I can show you all the toys. Just step outside the room if I give you the nod.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t reach for her hand on the way into the hospital; there were too many eyes around a hospital. He already knew he\u2019d be getting questions on Monday morning about who the girl he brought in on Saturday was. He didn\u2019t need to make the questions even more pointed.</p><p>They went straight up to Jack\u2019s room on the pediatric floor. Both of Jack\u2019s parents were there, looking exhausted. Jack\u2019s cheeks were too pale, and he was unusually silent, but he was sitting up in bed.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jack!\u201d Drew said as he walked in. \u201cHow are you feeling today?\u201d</p><p>Jack swiveled to the door when he heard Drew\u2019s voice and giggled.</p><p>\u201cDr. Nick! You aren\u2019t wearing your doctor costume.\u201d</p><p>Drew laughed, moving close enough to the bed for Jack to give him a high five with his good arm.</p> <p>\u201cI know! I\u2019m off duty for doctoring today. I just wanted to come by and check in on you since I was in the neighborhood.\u201d He smiled at Jack\u2019s parents. \u201cAbby, Fred, how are you guys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHanging in there,\u201d Abby said to him. He saw her eyes dart to the door, and he realized Alexa was still standing in the doorway. He lowered his voice.</p><p>\u201cI was nearby with a friend. Is it okay if she comes in to say hi to Jack? If not, it\u2019s no problem; she can wait in my office.\u201d</p><p>Abby smiled.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Jack\u2019s been getting bored with just us for entertainment.\u201d</p><p>He waved Alexa to his side.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jack, I brought a friend of mine to meet you. Jack, this is my friend Alexa. Can you say hi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d Jack giggled again. \u201cYou\u2019re not wearing a doctor costume, either.\u201d</p> <p>Alexa laughed as she offered her fist to Jack.</p><p>\u201cNo, but that\u2019s because I\u2019m not a doctor. Sorry, Jack.\u201d</p><p>Drew picked up Jack\u2019s chart from the end of the bed and checked it, satisfied with Jack\u2019s status.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the pain?\u201d he said in a low voice to Fred, as Jack chattered away with Alexa.</p><p>\u201cHe woke up a few times in the night. Abby was with him, but they seem to be managing it well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Nick, Dr. Nick, Mommy said I couldn\u2019t get out of bed yet, but I told her you would say I could, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He gave Jack his full attention and let himself get sucked into a conversation about Jack\u2019s favorite video game before he realized they\u2019d been there for longer than he\u2019d intended. He looked up, expecting to find Alexa watching him and Jack, but she was over in the corner deep in conversation with Abby.</p><p>Huh. It wasn\u2019t like he\u2019d brought her here so she could see what a good doctor he was, but she could at least notice.</p><p>\u201cJack, I\u2019m going to have to say good-bye now, but I\u2019ll see you in a few days, okay?\u201d</p><p>Abby looked in their direction.</p><p>\u201cSay thank you to Dr. Nichols for coming by to see you, Jack.\u201d</p><p>Alexa pulled something out of her purse and handed it to Abby, who hugged her. Alexa waved to Jack as they walked out of his room.</p><p>He took her hand as soon as they entered the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get a hug out of Abby? She still calls me Dr. Nichols in that very formal voice,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh, I was just giving her some advice about the kinds of services they could get. She told me about the accident and that it was a drunk driver.\u201d</p><p>He dug in his pocket for his car key. What did she mean, services?</p><p>\u201cThey have good health insurance, I think. Fred works for one of the studios.\u201d</p><p>She checked her phone and frowned at it before looking back up at him.</p><p>\u201cI know, she told me, but good insurance only goes so far. I meant all of the crime victims\u2019 services that they can get from the state. Counseling, compensation, help at home, stuff like that. She said she vaguely remembered being told about it right after the accident but had no idea how to access that stuff.\u201d</p><p>No wonder Abby had hugged her.</p><p>\u201cSo you gave her your card? What\u2019s the Berkeley mayor\u2019s office going to do about a kid in L.A.?\u201d</p><p>She looked back up from her phone and shrugged as they got in the car.</p><p>\u201cI have a list at work of all of the right people for her to contact. I told her to email me, and I can send it all her way and introduce her to some victims\u2019 rights advocates I know who can help her navigate it all. I can send them quick emails and cc her, just to speed things up a little.\u201d</p><p>He pulled onto the road for the short drive back to his apartment.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get all of that out of her in ten minutes? Teach me your secrets, Monroe.\u201d</p><p>Alexa grinned and put her phone back in her purse, thank God.</p><p>\u201cI have a way with people, don\u2019t you know? I work in politics.\u201d</p><p>He put his hand on her thigh. She shifted her body toward him and smiled.</p><p>\u201cMmm, you sure do have a way with people. The way you dealt with the inquisition we got at the wedding was pretty impressive, I have to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriendly deflection is one of my special talents.\u201d She put her hand on top of his. \u201cAnd Abby looked so worried. It\u2019s good to be able to help, if you can.\u201d</p><p>Oh Lord, he probably thought she was some bleeding-heart interferer now, butting into one of his cases when no one asked her to. But the look on that mom\u2019s face had broken her heart. Was she not supposed to try to help?</p><p>Fine, she was a bleeding-heart interferer. It was probably in her job description.</p><p>When they got to his apartment, he stopped her just inside the door.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, thanks for coming along to see Jack. And for being so nice to Abby. They\u2019ve had a rough time.\u201d</p><p>Drew pulled her into his arms, enveloping her into a hug that somehow felt more intimate than anything they\u2019d done before. She leaned her head into his chest and relaxed against him. She felt him exhale a deep breath and tightened her grip on his back, the worn cotton of his T-shirt smooth against her fingers. He bent down and kissed her hair, her ear, and when she tilted her head to look at him, her mouth.</p><p>\u201cI really appreciated you being there,\u201d he said when he pulled away.</p><p>She moved her hands up and under his shirt, loving the way he tensed at her touch.</p><p>\u201cShow me,\u201d she said.</p><p>He slung her over his shoulder in one quick motion, making her gasp.</p><p>\u201cDrew, no, I\u2019m too heavy!\u201d Ignoring her, he strode with her into the bedroom and tossed her down on his bed. She laughed when she bounced as she hit the mattress, but her laughter faded when he threw his clothes off and stood there naked in front of her.</p><p>\u201cOh my.\u201d When he made a move to jump on the bed along with her, she held up a hand to stop him. \u201cDon\u2019t move. Just . . . just stand there for a minute.\u201d</p><p>Despite all of the times they\u2019d had sex so far, she had yet to really see him naked. It had either been too frantic, or too dark, or too early in the morning for her to really pay attention. But now he stood there, the bright afternoon light from his bedroom windows streaming in on his hard body, and she spent a moment in pure awe. She knew just from touching him the contours of his chest, and that light sprinkling of hair, but it was quite another to see it in front of her, golden from the sun, hers to look at as long as she wanted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She lifted her finger in the air and spun it around to make him twirl like he was a beauty pageant contestant. Glory of glories, he obeyed her. The rush she got out of the pure power of that was only overwhelmed by her sight of his perfect, round, cuppable ass.</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d He didn\u2019t have to be told twice. He took a flying leap onto the bed and immediately rolled her underneath him, affording her the perfect opportunity to grab onto that ass and pull him against her.</p><p>She ran her hands all over his body, loving the sounds he made as she touched him, loving that he seemed to be enjoying this as much as she was.</p><p>\u201cYou wore panties today, didn\u2019t you?\u201d he said in her ear. Not waiting for an answer, he reached down and grabbed the thong she\u2019d worn, pulled it off her, and threw it across the room. \u201cYour turn,\u201d he said, looking down at her.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t pretend to misunderstand him, even though she wanted to. What was that she\u2019d been thinking earlier about how relaxed and confident she was around him? Because that feeling had faded after seeing his perfect body and knowing all of her own imperfections by heart . . . and how bright and sun filled his bedroom was. She suddenly really regretted those waffles at brunch.</p><p>He didn\u2019t let her hesitate, though. He pulled her dress over her head, reached around her back and unhooked her bra, and then leaned back on his heels to look at her.</p><p>She tried to force herself to look at his face, but her cheeks got hot and she had to look away. Her eyes drifted down his body, and that\u2019s when she saw clear evidence that he enjoyed looking at her body. She smiled.</p><p>\u201cOh, you like that, don\u2019t you?\u201d he said. \u201cBut wait. I was supposed to be showing you how much I appreciate you, wasn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>He slid down her body, pressing her legs open with his shoulders. She held her hands against his hair to keep him right where she wanted him. He increased the pace, and she moaned, her head shaking from side to side on the pillow. It felt so good she wanted it to stop and go on forever, all at the same time. Finally, she hit her peak and cried out as the vibrations rumbled through her body.</p> <p>He crawled up the bed so his head was level with hers and lay on his side next to her, his hand stroking her stomach as her breathing slowed.</p><p>\u201cDo you feel appreciated now?\u201d he asked. He kissed her neck and moved down to her breasts, his hand moving up to join his mouth.</p><p>\u201cMmmm,\u201d she answered. She leaned forward to kiss his shoulder, then pushed him until he fell on his back. She grinned and climbed on top of him. \u201cI think you\u2019ve done enough work for this afternoon, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She kissed him up and down his body, her fingers stroking his skin. She looked up at him: his arms were crossed behind his head, his whole body looked relaxed, and he was looking straight at her with that look that made her feel like a goddess. She ripped open the condom packet he\u2019d left on the pillow and rolled the condom on.</p><p>Usually it made her anxious to be on top. There was so much scrutiny in that position, so many parts of her body that jiggled, so much to make her feel shy. But she couldn\u2019t feel anything but pleasure when Drew\u2019s eyes worshipped her body like that.</p><p>When Alexa came to, she was still on top of him, her head pillowed by his chest. He reached down to pull off the condom, and she tried to roll off him, but he held her in place. She didn\u2019t fight it. He massaged her back as she lay there, and she felt like she could easily stay just like that for a few days. Maybe a few weeks.</p> <p>He leaned forward and kissed her ear.</p><p>\u201cFeeling appreciated yet?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged as much as she could in her prone position.</p><p>\u201cI mean, if that\u2019s all you can do, I guess so.\u201d</p><p>He growled in her ear and rolled her over underneath him as she laughed.</p><p>Alexa woke up the next morning alone in bed. She assumed that Drew was in the bathroom, but when he didn\u2019t get back in bed after a few minutes, she sat up and saw his bathroom door open and the light off. She pulled on his robe and wandered into the kitchen in the hopes that he was making coffee, but he wasn\u2019t there, either.</p><p>She decided that he\u2019d probably gone for a run on the beach like he said he did some mornings. She sort of wished he\u2019d left her a note but forced herself to shrug it off. She got back in bed with her neglected phone to check her work email. But first things first: she typed out a quick reply to a text from Maddie that just said ????????</p><p>Weekend so far: having fun, eating good food, great sex, don\u2019t wish you were here.</p> <p>Just then, she heard Drew\u2019s front door quietly open and close.</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re awake.\u201d He\u2019d tiptoed into the bedroom, holding two cups of coffee in a tray and a bakery bag. \u201cI thought you\u2019d still be asleep.\u201d</p><p>She looked at the bag, and then back to him.</p><p>\u201cI thought you went for a run, but this is much better. What\u2019s in the bag?\u201d</p><p>He laughed and handed her one of the coffee cups.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to ask what\u2019s in the cup?\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI know what\u2019s in the cup. I have eyes and a sense of smell. It\u2019s coffee! What I want to know is what\u2019s in that bag!\u201d She paused. \u201cWhat I meant to say right there was thank you for the coffee.\u201d</p><p>He sat down on the bed next to her, still keeping the bag out of her reach.</p><p>\u201cWeird, that\u2019s not what it sounded like.\u201d</p><p>She put the cup on the bedside table so she wouldn\u2019t spill it and reached for the bag, but he easily dodged her and flipped her over onto her back, the bag still out of reach.</p><p>\u201cDrew!\u201d</p><p>He kissed her on the tip of her nose.</p><p>\u201cMmm, I like you in this position.\u201d</p><p>She pulled his face down to kiss him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in the bag, Drew?\u201d</p><p>He laughed and tossed the bag into her lap.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d distracted you there for a minute.\u201d</p><p>She opened the bag to find a half dozen doughnuts, and her stomach rumbled.</p><p>\u201cOh my goodness! What is all of this? This is amazing!\u201d</p><p>He grinned.</p><p>\u201cNow I know what you must have been like opening Christmas presents as a kid. A plain glazed, one raspberry jelly filled, one lemon jelly filled, one with rainbow sprinkles, and two with bacon and maple frosting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBacon and maple frosting? What is this place? Is it direct from my wildest dreams?\u201d</p><p>Drew laughed as he grabbed one of the bacon doughnuts for himself.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea how great this doughnut shop is. I almost woke you up to make you come with me, but you were so sound asleep I didn\u2019t want to disturb you. Next time, though, you should come.\u201d</p><p>Next time? What did \u201cnext time\u201d mean in this context? It was Sunday, and she was leaving in less than twelve hours. Did he mean he wanted to go back there today? Or did he mean next time she was in L.A.? If so, what did he mean by that?</p><p>Don\u2019t overthink it, Alexa.</p><p>She tried to listen to Maddie\u2019s voice in her head and took a bite of the doughnut.</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d She swallowed and took a bigger bite. \u201cThese are amazing.\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her and wiped frosting from her cheek with his thumb.</p><p>\u201cDid you doubt me?\u201d</p><p>After the doughnuts, and her post-doughnut thank-you that went on for quite a while, he jumped in the shower. As soon as he was out of the room, she reached for her phone again. Her boss usually didn\u2019t email this early on a Sunday, and he\u2019d had that wedding to go to, but maybe he\u2019d had time to read her memo . . . Nope, he hadn\u2019t. To relieve her feelings, she shot off a quick email to Theo in the hopes that he would have some insight on when she might get a reply.</p><p>He emailed back a minute later:</p><p>You\u2019ve been working for him longer than I have and you know it. Don\u2019t you have better things to do\u2014this weekend especially\u2014than sit around on a Sunday morning and freak out about this?</p><p>She replied:</p><p>Teddy, no matter what other better things I have to do, I will always freak out about work, you know that.</p><p>\u201cGood news?\u201d She looked up to see Drew standing in the doorway in a towel.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She was distracted by that rivulet of water running down from his shoulder, down that cleft in his chest, straight down to . . . </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou were smiling at your phone. I was just wondering why.\u201d He sat on the bed next to her in his towel.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She sighed. For a few seconds there, she actually had stopped freaking out about work. \u201cNo, I was just laughing at something Theo said.\u201d</p><p>He got off the bed and dropped the towel, but too quickly pulled underwear and jeans on. He was still shirtless, though.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Theo?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>They\u2019d spent so much time together that it felt jarring that he didn\u2019t already know.</p><p>\u201cTheo\u2019s the mayor\u2019s communications director, my work spouse, a good friend, all wrapped into one.\u201d She got out of bed and reached for the robe that they\u2019d pushed to the floor.</p><p>He pulled on a gray T-shirt, just like the one he\u2019d been wearing when they met in the elevator. Maybe it was that same shirt. She remembered that flash of his chest in the elevator under his shirt, and how much she\u2019d wanted to run her hands up and down his chest. She still couldn\u2019t believe it had actually happened.</p><p>He looked out the window, not at her.</p><p>\u201cAre you guys . . . together or something?\u201d</p> <p>She tied the robe tightly around her body. Boy, did she not like the implications of that question.</p><p>\u201cMe and Theo? First of all, no. But second: do you really think I would be here with you this weekend if we were?\u201d</p><p>Weird that he\u2019d think that about her and Theo without knowing anything about him. Even weirder that he\u2019d think she\u2019d cheat on someone.</p><p>He looked at her and half smiled. She needed more than his cute little half smile after that. She walked toward the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cNo, wait, Alexa.\u201d He sat down on the bed and patted the spot beside him. She turned but didn\u2019t move toward him. \u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>Well, she was going to be here for the rest of the day anyway. What else was she going to do? She sat down.</p> <p>\u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t think . . . That\u2019s not what I meant. I asked that wrong. I just wanted to know, for future reference, if there\u2019d been anything between you guys. And plus, you were texting him on a Sunday morning\u201d\u2014his eyes dropped to her cleavage\u2014\u201cnaked. I don\u2019t usually text my work friends like that.\u201d</p><p>She thought about asking what \u201cfor future reference\u201d meant. But she had no idea how to have that conversation. She was great at difficult political conversations, not so much personal ones.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just on edge about work and I needed advice. He made fun of me instead; it made me feel better. It was an email, not a text.\u201d She paused. \u201cAnd I forgot I was naked.\u201d</p><p>Drew grinned.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She grinned back.</p><p>\u201cTheo and I couldn\u2019t possibly have more platonic of a relationship if we tried. He\u2019s like the brother I never had.\u201d</p><p>Drew sat back farther on the bed.</p> <p>\u201cWhat were you on edge about? What did you need advice about?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, this arts program for at-risk youth I\u2019m trying to get the mayor to support. I gave him my memo on Friday afternoon, and while I know he probably hasn\u2019t even read it yet, let alone made a decision, I still keep checking.\u201d</p><p>Drew put his arm around her and leaned back against the pillows.</p><p>\u201cThis program is really important to you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, her head against his chest.</p><p>\u201cTell me about it,\u201d he said, his fingers moving through her hair.</p><p>She hesitated. Was she ready to get into this with him just yet? Or ever, really? Would he understand? Would he even care? He kept waiting, though.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been interested in how to help teenagers. There are all sorts of programs for little kids, lots of reading groups and playgrounds and stuff like that. But people stop caring about kids once they hit the age of eleven or twelve. And everyone hates teenagers. Which sucks, because that\u2019s just the time of life when everything is changing and scary and you need help. And then when teenagers screw up, no one ever wants to give them a chance again. Especially teens of color.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut an arts program?\u201d She looked up at that tone in his voice and saw his raised eyebrows. \u201cIsn\u2019t that just rewarding kids who get into trouble? How\u2019s that going to deter them from getting in trouble again?\u201d</p><p>She sat all the way up and pulled the robe tighter around herself. She should have known he wouldn\u2019t get it. But this kind of attitude from him made her even more disappointed than she thought she could be. Disappointed and angry.</p><p>\u201cSending kids to jail for low-level offenses doesn\u2019t deter them from anything; it just makes it worse. People write them off. People like you.\u201d</p><p>He tried to interrupt, but she talked over him.</p><p>\u201cAnd that just makes them more likely to screw up again, because at that point they know that no one cares about them. A program like this would show them that people care. It\u2019s not a reward; they would be required to attend and complete the program, but it would give them different ways of coping with stress, and not push them into a system of punishment that could ruin their lives.\u201d</p><p>She shook herself and sat up. How was it that she could argue this point totally dispassionately at work, but not with Drew? See, this was why she couldn\u2019t be trusted with difficult personal conversations; her temper always got the better of her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll jump into the shower now, if you\u2019re all done with the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>Well, he\u2019d fucked that up. He\u2019d clearly hit a nerve there, and before he\u2019d had the chance to figure out what to say, she\u2019d fled to the shower.</p><p>He wondered if he should say something after she came out of the bathroom, but she gave him that bright smile she\u2019d kept using on Amy at the wedding and said she was hungry, so he didn\u2019t bring it up.</p><p>Instead, he drove her out to the Valley for dim sum for lunch, to a place Carlos had told him about. After they both had fits of giggles about the embarrassing amount of dumplings on their table, things seemed normal again.</p><p>They took a long nap in the afternoon sunlight when they got back to his apartment. He woke up to the breeze blowing her hair into his face and her nose nuzzling his neck. He turned over in bed and pulled her underneath him.</p><p>She laughed up at him from the nest of his sheets and pillows and his body, her dark hair fanned around her head like a halo, her brown skin glowing against his white sheets. He laughed, too, just because she was here and he was here with her. He kissed her forehead, her cheeks, her eyelids, and finally her lips. They kissed like that for a while, nothing more, both with their eyes open, looking straight at each other.</p><p>After a while, she sighed and put her finger on his lips.</p><p>\u201cDrew, as much as I would like to keep doing this . . . what time is it? My flight is at eight thirty, remember.\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath and rested his forehead on hers. He wasn\u2019t ready for this weekend to be over.</p><p>Finally, he looked up at his bedside clock.</p><p>\u201cFive.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and wrapped her arms around him.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Did you still want to stop at that burger place on the way to the airport?\u201d</p><p>He touched her cheek with his thumb.</p><p>\u201cI would rather stay here in bed doing very dirty things with you until we have to go, but if you\u2019re hungry . . .?\u201d</p><p>They didn\u2019t have time to get burgers.</p><p>Right before he got off the freeway to LAX, he cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not on call next weekend, so I could maybe come up. I mean, if you\u2019re free.\u201d</p><p>She glanced over at him, opened her mouth, and closed it again. Finally, she said, \u201cYeah, that works for me. You should come. I\u2019ll probably have some work to do, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>He interrupted her.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear from your boss about your memo?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, reached for her phone to double-check, and shook her head again.</p><p>\u201cHopefully tomorrow.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI can\u2019t count on it, though.\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cUm, I really hope he says yes.\u201d</p><p>She touched his hand, and he grabbed hers.</p><p>\u201cThanks. Me, too.\u201d</p><p>Too soon, they pulled into the terminal and he got out of the car to pull her suitcase out of the trunk. Still holding it, he joined her on the sidewalk and kissed her. Her arms went around his waist, and he marveled again at the touch of her hands, how they turned him on and soothed him all at the same time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She pulled back first.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t miss my flight.\u201d</p><p>He let go of her but didn\u2019t get back in his car yet.</p><p>\u201cRight, okay. See you next weekend?\u201d</p> <p>Her smile almost knocked him down. She nodded.</p><p>\u201cYeah. See you next weekend.\u201d</p><p>Alexa drove herself home from the Oakland airport, still in the combined mood of euphoria and confusion that she\u2019d been in since getting out of Drew\u2019s car at LAX. He\u2019d kept making little references to the future all weekend, from saying that they\u2019d go to the doughnut shop \u201cnext time,\u201d to asking about Theo \u201cfor future reference.\u201d The whole time, she had been too afraid of destroying the mood to ask him what he meant by all that.</p><p>But then when they were almost at LAX, damn it, he\u2019d gone and said that he\u2019d come up to Berkeley next weekend. What was she supposed to have done then? Quiz him on his intentions in the drop-off line at LAX? It\u2019s not like she thought this relationship was going anywhere significant. Drew had made it very clear in the elevator that he wasn\u2019t that kind of guy.</p><p>So instead, she\u2019d just said okay. She wasn\u2019t overthinking this, remember?</p> <p>But she couldn\u2019t sleep that night. Her mind cycled around thoughts of Drew, her boss, her memo and what was probably wrong with it, the weekend and how much fun she\u2019d had, Drew, work the next day, his text asking her to text him when she was home and his increasingly dirty texts after that, the new policy director she was going to have to hire, Drew, the way he\u2019d looked at her when they were in bed. Finally she got up and made a cup of chamomile tea and washed it down with half a Tylenol PM, which gave her about four hours of too-deep sleep.</p><p>She woke up groggy but in a much better mood than the night before. She was on her way to the job that she loved, she\u2019d spent all weekend having sex with a hot doctor, and if she was a betting woman, she would bet that Theo would bring doughnuts in that morning.</p><p>Sure enough, she ran into him on her way into the building, a pink box in his hand.</p><p>\u201cMy hero!\u201d she said as she handed him the coffee she\u2019d bought him.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know I was going to bring doughnuts?\u201d He eyed his coffee and the grin on her face.</p><p>\u201cI had a hunch.\u201d She popped open the box and took out hers. \u201cJust what I needed.\u201d</p> <p>He tested his coffee for temperature, not taking a sip yet.</p><p>\u201cWe all know you got lucky this weekend. Do you need to flaunt it?\u201d</p><p>She just grinned and took a big bite of her doughnut as he followed her into her office.</p><p>\u201cBefore I forget, did you hear anything? Normally, I wouldn\u2019t have even had to ask, but with you gone this weekend . . .\u201d His voice trailed away as she shook her head. He sat down in one of the chairs in front of her desk.</p><p>\u201cOkay, we\u2019ll talk about that in a minute. First: the weekend went well, I\u2019m guessing?\u201d He sipped his coffee and reached for his own doughnut.</p><p>\u201cIt did, thank you.\u201d She pushed all of her anxieties from the night before away and grinned at him.</p><p>He leaned back in his seat as she sat down and turned on her computer.</p><p>\u201cExcellent. Are you going to see him again?\u201d</p> <p>She shrugged.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to come up here this weekend.\u201d</p><p>He toasted her with his coffee cup.</p><p>\u201cGood job, Lex. I\u2019m glad one of us is having fun with something that isn\u2019t work related.\u201d</p><p>She laughed.</p><p>\u201cMe, too. Now, about my program\u2014when do you think the boss will give me a yea or nay? Or even a maybe or nay?\u201d</p><p>Theo took a long sip of his coffee and sat back in the chair.</p><p>\u201cWell, either he read it over the weekend and will come in with questions for you today . . . or he didn\u2019t even glance at it over the weekend and you\u2019ll have to remind him about it today. We\u2019ll know that soon, at least.\u201d</p><p>But she heard nothing from the mayor about her project all morning, even though she sat through two meetings at his side. The third of the day was their biweekly meeting with the city attorney. After the city attorney ran through the list of current lawsuits against the city (protestors, slip-and-fall cases, employment matters, something about a clown) and pending settlement offers, the mayor looked up from the doodles on his notepad.</p><p>\u201cGreat. Now that we\u2019re done with all of that, Alexa has an idea to run by you. It\u2019s not a legal problem, but I want to make crystal clear that there are no liability issues before we bring this to the council, got it?\u201d</p><p>Thanks, boss, for springing this on me. She didn\u2019t even have her notes with her. Luckily, she could recite this from memory.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. Susan, here\u2019s my proposal.\u201d</p><p>She floated back into her office. She hadn\u2019t won yet, and there was a long fight ahead, but at least the mayor was with her now. She walked into Theo\u2019s office to shout the news at him. But it was empty.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s having coffee with a reporter,\u201d Theo\u2019s assistant called out to her.</p><p>Damn it.</p><p>She needed to share this joy with someone. When she pulled her phone out to text Maddie, she saw a text from Drew.</p><p>How\u2019s your Monday? Any word from your boss about your idea?</p><p>Huh. After their not-quite-fight about it on Sunday, she was surprised he\u2019d brought it up again. She was so excited that she wanted to text him with about forty exclamation points, but she tempered her impulse.</p><p>Just talked to him. He\u2019s in! Good start to the week.</p><p>Fine, one exclamation point, so sue her.</p><p>Great news! What did he say?</p><p>She made a mental note to reward him for giving her an exclamation point back.</p><p>Hardly said anything, sprung it on me during a meeting with the city atty.</p><p>She plopped down at her desk, slid off her shoes, and twirled around in her office chair. By the time her rotation slowed, she had another text.</p><p>Great work, I\u2019m happy for you.</p><p>She spun her chair again and beamed down at her phone.</p><p>I\u2019m happy for me too!!</p><p>She couldn\u2019t hold back on the exclamation points that time, because it was true. She was happy about her project, happy that she had Drew to tell about this battle she\u2019d fought, happy that he was happy for her. She was so busy smiling and spinning and looking at her phone that she didn\u2019t even notice Theo come into her office.</p><p>\u201cYou were looking for me?\u201d</p><p>She jumped up, almost knocking over her chair in the process.</p><p>\u201cTheo! Listen to what just happened.\u201d</p><p>Just as she finished telling him the whole story, her phone buzzed again.</p><p>We\u2019ll have something good to celebrate this weekend.</p><p>She beamed at her phone again. Theo\u2019s eyebrows shot up.</p><p>\u201cYou told him?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cWhat do you . . . I didn\u2019t . . . How did you . . .\u201d She sighed and gave up.</p><p>\u201cI knew because I know you. Okay, we have to plan this out. Coffee in an hour?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and waved him out the door. Maybe all of her middle-of-the-night anxieties\u2014about everything\u2014had been for nothing.</p><p>Carlos had been so busy on Monday he\u2019d barely nodded at Drew, and he\u2019d gotten to their basketball league at the last minute. Drew hoped that meant he\u2019d managed to escape the Carlos brand of humor about Alexa.</p><p>But he heard a shout after the game when he was almost at his car.</p><p>\u201cI liked her, you know.\u201d</p><p>Drew turned around to find Carlos jogging toward him, a broad grin on his face.</p><p>\u201cI noticed. You sure seemed to want to spend extra time with her.\u201d</p><p>Carlos caught up with him.</p><p>\u201cHow long did it take for you to jump her after I walked out the door?\u201d</p><p>Drew flashed back to Friday night. They\u2019d barely stopped to take off their clothes. He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNone of your business.\u201d</p><p>Carlos laughed.</p><p>\u201cThat fast, huh? I thought you\u2019d throw me out the window if I was there for another minute.\u201d</p><p>Drew unlocked his car and tossed his bag in the trunk.</p><p>\u201cIf you had stayed another minute, we might have tested that theory.\u201d</p><p>Carlos wiggled his eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cSoooo, when are you going to see her again? You are going to see her again, right?\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he was going to see her again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis weekend.\u201d He tried and failed to hold back a grin. \u201cFlying up there for the long weekend.\u201d</p><p>Carlos patted him on the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cFinally. Good job, dude. Proud of you.\u201d</p><p>Drew shook Carlos\u2019s hand off his shoulder and opened his car door. Oh great, now Carlos was smug because he got him to text Alexa in the first place. He never would have done it if he\u2019d known he was in for this.</p> <p>Okay, never mind that, yes, he would have.</p><p>\u201cProud of me for what, asshole?\u201d</p><p>Carlos grinned.</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019ll see. Tell Alexa I say hi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he sleeping with anyone else?\u201d Maddie asked as she sipped her second margarita.</p> <p>Alexa paused, her own drink halfway to her mouth. That hadn\u2019t occurred to her. Why hadn\u2019t it occurred to her?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Because she hadn\u2019t wanted to think about him with anyone else, that was why. \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said he isn\u2019t really one for commitment, so I wondered,\u201d Maddie said. \u201cAre you going to ask him?\u201d</p><p>Alexa took a sip of her drink. This wasn\u2019t what she\u2019d expected from margarita night with Maddie. Taco Tuesday was not supposed to be stressful. She didn\u2019t want the third degree about Drew; she just wanted some uncomplicated applause.</p><p>At least she\u2019d gotten that from Theo.</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t thought about it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay. So I guess asking if you guys are dating now is going to get the same non-answer, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Alexa set her drink down.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to \u2018Don\u2019t overthink everything, Alexa\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Maddie laughed.</p><p>\u201cI guess sometimes you do listen to me. But that was different! And even now, I\u2019m not saying you need to overthink things . . . just don\u2019t under-think them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat, perfect thinking balance, that doesn\u2019t sound hard at all. Why didn\u2019t I think of that? Now can we talk about you instead? Who was the client who pissed you off this week?\u201d</p><p>Maddie\u2019s styling business was thriving, which meant she always had great stories. Alexa laughed throughout the tale of graduation dress shopping for a whole family, ages seventy, fifty-five, eighteen, and nine.</p><p>Unfortunately, now that she\u2019d been given permission to start thinking more about the Drew situation, it was all she could think about.</p> <p>\u201cShould I ask him?\u201d Alexa asked, midway through her second drink.</p><p>\u201cI guess that depends on how much you want to know the answer,\u201d Maddie said.</p><p>Wednesday afternoon, Drew\u2019s phone buzzed in his pocket while he was in the middle of an appointment with Jack and Abby. He grinned, almost certain of who had just texted him. He and Alexa had been texting each other all week, both in innocent and creative ways, though she\u2019d been strangely silent today. He fought the urge to pull his phone out of his pocket and concentrated on Jack.</p><p>When Abby and Jack were walking out the door, she stopped and turned around.</p><p>\u201cYour friend Alexa\u2019s been so helpful. She\u2019s gotten me in touch with help that I didn\u2019t even know existed. Please thank her for me.\u201d</p><p>Alexa hadn\u2019t even told him she\u2019d been in touch with Abby.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be happy to hear that,\u201d he said. Jack high-fived him with his good arm as they left.</p><p>He ducked into his office in between patients to text her. But then he saw the text that had come in during his appointment.</p><p>Are you sleeping with anyone else?</p><p>Whoa, wait, what had prompted that? He responded before he stopped to think.</p><p>Not at the moment, I\u2019m at work.</p><p>Why did he never stop to think?</p><p>I see. What about after work, will I get a different answer?</p><p>Maybe another joke would help.</p><p>No, tonight is basketball night.</p><p>There was a knock on his office door, and he looked up.</p><p>\u201cDr. Nichols? Your one thirty is in the exam room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right there!\u201d he said, and looked back down at his phone.</p><p>How about this: now you have the weekend free so neither work nor basketball nor I will get in the way.</p><p>What the fuck? How did that escalate so quickly? And why the fuck had she brought this up right now in the middle of the day? In a text message?</p><p>Come on, can you just calm down about this? I was just joking.</p><p>He sat down on the edge of his desk, ignoring the files that fell onto the floor.</p><p>Hahahahaha so funny.</p><p>Somehow, he didn\u2019t think those were genuine hahahahas. While he was still thinking about what to say to her, his phone buzzed again.</p><p>Look, Drew, I\u2019m too busy to deal with this. I don\u2019t think this is a good idea.</p><p>Drew barely caught himself from cursing out loud, and luckily remembered that there were small children and their parents just outside the door.</p><p>\u201cDr. Nichols?\u201d The knock on his door was louder. Shit, he was running even later than usual.</p><p>\u201cComing!\u201d</p><p>Come on, Alexa. What the hell?</p><p>He slammed his phone down onto his desk and opened his office door hard enough for it to bang into the wall. Why the fuck did women have to do things like this?</p><p>\u201cEverything okay there, Dr. Nichols?\u201d the nurse asked.</p><p>\u201cFine. Who\u2019s next?\u201d</p><p>He raged through his next four patients. He forced himself to smile at the kids, but he was particularly curt to one of the moms, and he knew he\u2019d hear about that later.</p><p>Carlos came into his office at the end of the day when he was getting ready to go.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you still in those clothes?\u201d Carlos dribbled an imaginary basketball on his office floor. \u201cBasketball tonight!\u201d</p><p>He flashed back to the text he\u2019d sent Alexa that day and cringed.</p><p>\u201cGotta bail, sorry.\u201d His general plan was to go home and drink all of the beer in his fridge.</p><p>\u201cWhy, gotta call your girl?\u201d Carlos asked. \u201cYou really going to ditch us for her? Though, I have to say, she is really . . .\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to hear the end of that sentence.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not my girl.\u201d He threw his bag over his shoulder and walked out the door. Carlos, of course, followed him. Still talking.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, of course you\u2019ll say that. I know how you are. But anyone who sees you together knows the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s. Not. My. Girl.\u201d Drew got in the elevator, not looking at Carlos, but he could feel his scrutiny.</p><p>\u201cOkay. What happened?\u201d Carlos pressed the button for the lobby, still staring at him. Of all people, he did not want to talk to Carlos about this. He\u2019d make it a whole big thing, and it wasn\u2019t a big thing. It had just been two fucking weekends, it was over, and he didn\u2019t want to deal with it or think about it anymore.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d They rode down the whole way in silence. Carlos followed him across the street to the parking garage and got in the elevator with him there.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell me now?\u201d Carlos got off the elevator with him and walked with him toward his car.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have somewhere to be? Why are you following me? Go play basketball.\u201d</p><p>Carlos gestured to the left, and Drew saw his gleaming red BMW. \u201cI parked two cars away from you this morning, jackass. I\u2019m not following you.\u201d He leaned against Drew\u2019s much more battered car and studied him. \u201cThough, that is a good idea. You realize that I do have a key to your house, right? If you don\u2019t tell me what got you in this mood, you know I\u2019m just going to follow you home until you do. And I know it\u2019s about Alexa, so don\u2019t try to bullshit me.\u201d</p><p>Drew sighed. As much as he\u2019d fought it, he\u2019d known it was inevitable.</p><p>\u201cFine, follow me home, but you\u2019d better stop to get us food on the way. And you\u2019re paying.\u201d</p><p>Twenty minutes later, Carlos walked into his apartment carrying two In-N-Out bags. Drew ripped them open, bit into a Double-Double, and washed that down with his second beer. Then he flipped to Alexa\u2019s text messages and tossed his phone to Carlos.</p><p>\u201cYou might as well just read what happened today, so I don\u2019t have to tell you. Scroll down.\u201d</p><p>Drew watched Carlos\u2019s face as he read. In seconds it went from puzzlement to amusement, to outrage, and finally landed on exasperation. He set the phone down in the center of the table, popped open a beer, took a long sip, and sat back against the couch cushions. Finally, he looked at Drew. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201c \u2018Not at the moment\u2019? Really?\u201d</p><p>Drew thumped his empty beer bottle down on the table.</p><p>\u201cIt was a joke!\u201d</p><p>Carlos unwrapped a burger for himself.</p> <p>\u201cOh yeah? Did you think she would think that was funny? Did you think that any woman would think that was funny?\u201d</p><p>Drew got up and went into the kitchen for another beer.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking! I wasn\u2019t prepared for that question! Why did she text me that? In the middle of the day? On a WEDNESDAY?\u201d</p><p>Carlos squeezed out three ketchup packets onto his hamburger wrapper and grabbed a handful of fries. Ugh, he always took all of the ketchup. Drew should have just gotten his own damn hamburgers and gotten drunk at home alone in peace.</p><p>\u201cSo, what, a Thursday would have been better?\u201d</p> <p>He wanted to throw his beer bottle at Carlos\u2019s head. Instead, he drank from it and sat back down in his corner of the couch.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Carlos asked. \u201cJust making a joke.\u201d</p><p>Okay, that was it. He didn\u2019t have to take this shit in his own house.</p><p>\u201cFuck you! Go home.\u201d</p><p>Carlos had the audacity to laugh at him.</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean it, fuck you.\u201d</p> <p>Carlos stopped laughing at him, but he settled himself and his burger and beer more comfortably on the couch.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re going to call her, though, right?</p><p>Drew slammed his beer bottle on the table. The beer fizzed up and overflowed everywhere.</p><p>\u201cNo, why would I? I can find another girl. I have before; I will again.\u201d</p><p>Carlos didn\u2019t say anything as Drew went back to the kitchen for another beer. Drew sat back on the couch and took a gulp.</p><p>\u201cIt was going to have to end at some time anyway. Better it end now before she really hates me.\u201d</p><p>He looked up and saw Carlos looking at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p> <p>Drew shrugged off the question and reached for the food. When he looked up, Carlos was still staring at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat? What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Carlos shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNothing, dude. Finish your burger.\u201d</p><p>Alexa spent the rest of the afternoon first furious at Drew, then at herself. Why had she decided to text him in the middle of the day on a Wednesday, for God\u2019s sake? Did she have to do this right when she was about to go into three back-to-back meetings where she had to concentrate and be diplomatic and pay attention? Shouldn\u2019t she have waited to talk about this in person?</p><p>After the last of her meetings, not only did she have to drive her boss home, but he made her sit in the driveway with him and talk about their transportation plan for fifteen minutes.</p><p>She felt like she was going to crawl out of her skin. She was angry that she had gotten so invested in a relationship that had lasted all of thirteen days, angry she\u2019d done all of that for something that wasn\u2019t even a relationship in the first place, angry at Drew for being such a jackass, angry at Drew for being such a great guy for ninety-eight percent of those thirteen days, angry at herself for being on the point of tears for six straight hours when she prided herself on never crying, angry at her boss for still talking about fucking bicycles when she just wanted to go home.</p><p>Finally, the mayor\u2019s wife called him from inside the house and told him that unless he came inside in two minutes she was going to eat their dinner without him.</p><p>All Alexa wanted to do was go home and wallow, but even that made her angry\u2014how dare she need to wallow after such a short time? She barely even knew him! Why couldn\u2019t she be like one of those women who could sleep with a guy for a few weeks, never see him again, no big deal? She envied those women.</p><p>She put on her most comfortable yoga pants when she got home and texted Maddie.</p><p>The Drew thing is over, I don\u2019t want to talk about it.</p><p>Her phone buzzed a second later.</p><p>You OK?</p><p>She dropped her favorite bra on her bedroom floor and shook her head.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to talk about it.</p><p>Maddie knocked on her door thirty minutes later with two bottles of wine poking out of her purse and a large pepperoni pizza in her hands.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to talk,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m hungry, and I thought you might be hungry, too. And there\u2019s a marathon of Say Yes to the Dress on right now, so . . .\u201d</p><p>Alexa took the pizza out of her hands and turned toward the couch.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the wineglasses.\u201d</p><p>Alexa sat in her office the following Tuesday with the door closed. She\u2019d closed it for a conference call, but the call was long over. She needed some time when no one would walk by and pop their head in, time when she wouldn\u2019t have to smile and act professional and interested. Time to studiously not think about what her long weekend would have been like if she hadn\u2019t sent those texts. She put her head down on her desk and closed her eyes.</p><p>She wished she could throw herself into work, but the whole day had been super slow because of Memorial Day the day before. Even though she was furiously making lists of who to talk to next and doing more research for her program, it felt like busywork more than anything else. Normally, she enjoyed quiet weeks at work where she could put her head down and clear things off her plate. But this week she needed all of the chaos that she wasn\u2019t getting.</p><p>Her phone buzzed, but she ignored it. It was probably Theo, asking if she was free, or Maddie, checking up on her, or her cousin, needing a favor, and she just couldn\u2019t deal with anyone right now.</p><p>But even so, she pushed her phone under the curve of her arms and opened one eye to see who it was. Just in case.</p><p>Theo. The wave of disappointment hit all over again. It wasn\u2019t like she expected Drew to text her. There had been no word from him for a week, and she hadn\u2019t reached out to him, either. So why was she still hopeful?</p><p>She left her office without responding to Theo\u2019s text and walked up two flights of stairs to go to the bathroom. Less of a chance she\u2019d see people that she\u2019d have to talk to on another floor. She splashed cold water on her face, repaired her makeup, and installed a smile on her mouth before she went back down and knocked on Theo\u2019s door.</p><p>\u201cYou needed me?\u201d She leaned against the doorframe and hoped this was short.</p><p>Theo looked up from his computer.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but this isn\u2019t about work. You\u2019re still coming to my birthday thing this weekend, right?\u201d</p><p>Shit, she\u2019d totally forgotten about Theo\u2019s birthday. On top of everything else, she was a terrible friend.</p><p>\u201cOf course! Wouldn\u2019t miss it!\u201d</p><p>Theo narrowed his eyes and beckoned her into his office.</p><p>\u201cYou forgot, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She gave up and slumped into a seat in front of his desk.</p><p>\u201cOkay, yeah, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s on my calendar. It\u2019s not like I wasn\u2019t going to come. What\u2019s the plan, again?\u201d She knew she\u2019d talked to Theo about this at some point, but it was all mixed in with her cousin\u2019s engagement party and the grand opening next week of that new bar on Telegraph that the mayor had decided to attend.</p><p>\u201cNow I know something is wrong with you. We\u2019re meeting at the Royal Arms in the Mission for drinks.\u201d</p><p>She made a face. \u201cI hate that place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know, that\u2019s what you said the last time we talked about it. But my buddy Nate is a part owner and is giving us a fat discount.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate your buddy Nate,\u201d she said without any heat. She\u2019d said that the last time, too; it was all coming back to her.</p><p>\u201cI know. Dave will be there. He\u2019s always had a thing for you. Maybe he can pull you out of this funk.\u201d</p><p>She thought about denying that she was in a funk, but what was the point?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll snap out of it at some point. Just stressed about everything with my program, that\u2019s all.\u201d She stood up to go back to her office and stopped in the doorway. \u201cWho all else is coming? Can I bring Maddie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople you like, I swear. I invited the whole crew from the campaign. But yeah, bring Maddie if you want.\u201d</p><p>Drew went for two long runs on the beach over Memorial Day weekend. He repeatedly reminded himself that if he\u2019d been up in Berkeley with Alexa, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to do that. He walked back home along the beach, checked out all of the women in bikinis, and tried and failed to make himself hit on one of them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He went to a birthday party, one that he would have happily bailed on to be in Berkeley. He left before the blonde in the strapless dress who reminded him of Amy could put her hand on his ass again. Sunday afternoon, he almost texted Vivian, a girl he\u2019d been sleeping with for a while in the fall, but he watched golf on the couch all afternoon instead. He was relieved to fill in for someone and be on call on Monday.</p><p>Carlos burst into Drew\u2019s office on Wednesday afternoon.</p><p>\u201cHey man, my trip to Hawaii was great, thanks for asking.\u201d</p><p>Drew looked up from his stack of files.</p> <p>\u201cYou were in Hawaii?\u201d</p><p>Carlos rolled his eyes and dropped into a chair.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such an asshole. My cousin\u2019s wedding? I was a groomsman? I left Friday morning, which is why you had to cover for me on Friday?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cRight, sorry that your travel schedule isn\u2019t on the top of my mind at every moment of the day. You have my apologies.\u201d He went back to puzzling out his own handwriting in his files.</p> <p>\u201cWow, someone is still in a shitty mood, huh?\u201d Carlos settled into the chair. Damn it, he should have just smiled and asked him about his trip and he would have been gone after a few minutes. Now he was going to have to deal with this bullshit.</p><p>\u201cJust busy, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Carlos looked at the pile of files on his desk and raised his eyebrows. Drew only did this work when he was forced into it or had nothing else to do to keep him occupied, and Carlos knew it.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m guessing from the look on your face that you didn\u2019t go to Berkeley last weekend? Did you even try to fix it?\u201d</p><p>Drew kept his eyes on his computer and attempted to keep his voice level.</p><p>\u201cLeave it alone, Carlos.\u201d</p> <p>Of course he\u2019d thought about trying to fix it. But what was the point?</p><p>Carlos stood up, thank God.</p><p>\u201cFine, keep brooding. But you\u2019d better have pulled yourself together by the time we go to San Francisco this weekend.\u201d</p><p>Drew\u2019s head shot up. What the hell was he talking about? Why the hell would he be going to San Francisco?</p><p>Carlos laughed. At, not with him, he was pretty sure.</p><p>\u201cThe American Association of Pediatric Hospital Medicine Conference? We planned it, like, two months ago? We\u2019re the only two junior peds from this hospital who get to go? We leave tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>Drew laid his head down on his desk, lifted it, and banged it back down. Luckily, the files on his desk cushioned him.</p><p>\u201cYou remember now, I see.\u201d Carlos walked to the door. \u201cHave fun packing.\u201d</p> <p>Drew let out a sigh when he was finally alone again in his office. Great, just the place he didn\u2019t want to go. He jumped when Carlos poked his head back in the door.</p><p>\u201cYou should call her and tell her you\u2019ll be in town.\u201d</p><p>Drew got up and slammed the door in Carlos\u2019s face.</p><p>Maddie was all in for Theo\u2019s party, especially since her on-again, off-again relationship with Chris was off, this time (she said) for good. Thank God; Alexa had never liked that guy. Maddie volunteered to be the designated driver for the night on the condition that Alexa wear whatever she ordered.</p><p>This meant that Alexa sat in Maddie\u2019s car Saturday night in a leather jacket and a strapless black dress, wearing altogether too much eye makeup and heels at least an inch too high. Sometimes giving the reins over to Maddie wasn\u2019t the best idea.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure about this outfit?\u201d she asked Maddie again, even though it was too late to change. \u201cI have way too much cleavage with this dress, and this makeup isn\u2019t me. Plus, this is San Francisco. All of the dudes there will be in jeans and hoodies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust because their standards are low does not mean that we should lower ours.\u201d Maddie backed into the parking spot on a side street that they\u2019d found after ten minutes of circling. \u201cAnd why do you care about your cleavage? What happened to \u2018If you\u2019ve got them, flaunt them\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Alexa checked her reflection in the car mirror one last time.</p><p>\u201cThere are going to be a ton of douchebags here tonight, that\u2019s what happened. All of those tech bros that Theo\u2019s friend Nate knows. And the rest of the people there will be people I\u2019ve worked with. I don\u2019t want them to think . . .\u201d</p><p>Maddie jumped out of the car and shut the door. Alexa knew a hint to stop talking when she heard one.</p><p>She grinned when she looked at Maddie, wearing a hot pink minidress and tall black boots. Hopefully, at least Maddie would get some action tonight. She needed to find someone good to her after that asshole Chris.</p><p>\u201cAll right, fine,\u201d Alexa said. \u201cLet\u2019s do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t handle this for one more minute,\u201d Drew whispered to Carlos.</p><p>It was the awards dinner at the conference. The ballroom of the Palace Hotel was filled to the brim with self-congratulatory doctors. Drew wanted to stab himself in the head with a fork.</p><p>\u201cOn it,\u201d Carlos said. \u201cI\u2019m going to the bathroom in two minutes. Three minutes later, you go up to the bar for another drink. We\u2019ll meet up by the taxi stand outside and get the hell out of here.\u201d</p><p>In ten minutes, the two of them were in a cab, laughing at how well they\u2019d executed their plan. It was the first moment of fun Drew had had in two days. The conference had been educational, sure, and he\u2019d gotten to spend more time with Dr. Davis, his mentor from med school, but it had been two full days of networking and listening and smiling and taking notes, even in the hotel bar at night. And the whole time he kept trying to not remember that Alexa was just a bridge away. Thank God Carlos was there, too. He would have died from either boredom or frustration otherwise.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d He hadn\u2019t paid attention when Carlos had yelled out an address to the cabbie.</p><p>\u201cI just told him 24th and Valencia. I figured we could find somewhere good to go around there, and no one from the conference is going to get that far from here.\u201d He thought for a minute. \u201cAnd if they do, we want to know who they are so we can find them at next year\u2019s conference.\u201d</p><p>They walked into the first bar they found and were soon drinking bourbon and watching basketball with everyone else sitting at the bar. Halfway through the first bourbon their jackets were off and their ties were loosened. By the time they\u2019d finished their drinks, they\u2019d made friends with the bearded dudes on either side of them and their tattooed bartender, so much so that they ordered a large pizza for delivery to the bar, with the bartender\u2019s blessing.</p><p>After his third drink, Drew got up to find the bathroom. His new friends pointed him to the back of the bar, so he weaved through a crowd of people to get there. On his way back to his barstool he heard the laughter. He turned his head and saw her.</p><p>She was over in the corner, and a black dude in glasses had his arm around her. Without thinking about it, he walked toward them and stopped just outside their circle.</p><p>\u201cAlexa.\u201d</p><p>She turned, and when her eyes met his, her smile blew him away all over again. It was hesitant at first, and then grew in strength, like a light with a dimming switch being turned up. He smiled back at her, trying to think of what to say, but between the bourbon and the hunger and her smile, his mind was blank.</p><p>\u201cDrew. What . . . what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t sound upset to see him, and she was still smiling at him. Those were good signs. But that guy\u2019s arm was still around her.</p><p>Suddenly, instead of being on the other side of the circle of people from her, he was right in front of her.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I doing at this bar, or in San Francisco?\u201d he asked. He wanted to reach out for her but stopped himself.</p><p>\u201cEither.\u201d She raised her eyebrows and her smile dimmed a little. \u201cBoth.\u201d</p><p>He touched her hand but didn\u2019t take it. Had he forgotten how good it felt to be around her, or had he forced himself to block that out?</p><p>\u201cConference. Carlos and I are both here.\u201d He inclined his head in the direction of the bar. \u201cWe had to bail on the awards dinner tonight, and somehow we ended up here.\u201d He moved closer to her, so their bodies were almost touching. He could feel her body heat through that tight dress she was wearing. She didn\u2019t move away. \u201cAnd you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She looked away from him and at the pack of people surrounding them. Most of the people who\u2019d been in the circle around her had melted away. Except for the dude in glasses and the woman in pink; they were both staring at him.</p><p>He stood close to her, hoping that the dude in glasses would get the hint. He didn\u2019t. Wait, was Alexa with this guy?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Theo\u2019s birthday party, and\u2014\u201d The woman in pink elbowed her, not at all subtly, and she laughed again. \u201cSorry, sorry. Drew, this is Theo, the birthday boy, and this is my friend Maddie. Maddie, Theo: Drew.\u201d</p><p>Of course it was fucking Theo. Maddie shifted her drink to her other hand so they could shake hands.</p> <p>\u201cMaddie, nice to meet you. I\u2019ve heard a lot about you.\u201d He turned. \u201cYou, too, Theo.\u201d</p><p>At least Theo\u2019d had to move his arm away from Alexa\u2019s shoulder to shake Drew\u2019s hand.</p><p>Maddie grinned at him, her eyebrows dancing.</p><p>\u201cLikewise, Drew. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019ve got to freshen up this drink. And I think the birthday boy needs another, don\u2019t you, Theo?\u201d She disappeared in the direction of the bar with her almost-full drink and with an iron grip on Theo\u2019s arm. Drew was pretty sure he was going to like Maddie.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said, once they were alone. He touched her bare arm and this time didn\u2019t let go. \u201cCan I, um\u2014can we talk for a minute?\u201d Now that he\u2019d seen her, he couldn\u2019t just walk back to his barstool.</p> <p>She looked in the direction that Theo and Maddie had disappeared in, and then back at him. Shit, was she going to tell him to go away?</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she finally said. He grabbed her hand and pulled her deeper into the corner.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry about what I said. In the texts, I mean. I wasn\u2019t thinking,\u201d he said, once the din around them was a little quieter. He wanted to step closer but didn\u2019t want her to back away.</p><p>She squeezed his hand.</p><p>\u201cNo, Drew, I\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have started all of that. It wasn\u2019t . . . I didn\u2019t want . . .\u201d</p><p>He looked down at her. That strapless dress she was wearing . . . he wanted to pull down the neckline and kiss her in that hollow between her breasts.</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t,\u201d he blurted out. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m not. I mean . . .\u201d She looked up at him with a question in her eyes, and he realized how incoherent he was being. \u201cWhat you asked me in that text. I\u2019m not sleeping with anyone else.\u201d</p><p>When she met his eyes and smiled, he stepped closer to her. She didn\u2019t move away.</p><p>\u201cYou look great tonight,\u201d he said. She released his hand, and his heart fell for a second. When he felt her fingers stroke his waistline and pull him against her, he sighed in relief.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here,\u201d she said.</p><p>His hand moved from her arm to her waist. He bent down to kiss her just as she reached up to him.</p><p>The kiss was familiar and a surprise all at the same time. It was like coming home to kiss her, like sliding naked into a freshly made bed with sheets just from the dryer, warm and sexy and everything he wanted. He cupped her face and kissed her harder.</p><p>She bit his lip and he jumped.</p><p>\u201cWere you getting me back for something there?\u201d He licked her lip.</p> <p>She laughed against his mouth, and he laughed with her. How had he even thought about giving her up?</p><p>\u201cJust checking to make sure it\u2019s really you. That you\u2019re really here.\u201d</p><p>He felt a hand on his back and flinched. He turned his head and shielded Alexa with his body. If this was that Theo . . .</p><p>He relaxed when he saw Carlos behind him.</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re done here, there\u2019s pizza up at the bar, and . . . Alexa!\u201d Carlos\u2019s voice lost the stiffness, and he backed away. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t realize it was you. Don\u2019t mind me. Good to see you, Alexa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarlos!\u201d She wiggled out from behind Drew to hug him. \u201cGood to see you, too. It\u2019s my friend Theo\u2019s birthday party. Let me introduce you guys to some people.\u201d</p><p>Alexa brought them both to the group around Theo and Maddie and did introductions all around. Theo didn\u2019t quite look thrilled to see him, but at least he didn\u2019t throw him out of the bar, not even when Alexa went off to the bathroom.</p><p>Alexa was not at all surprised to find Maddie lying in wait for her outside the bathroom door.</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s Drew, huh?\u201d Maddie said with a wide grin.</p><p>Alexa grinned back at her. Damn, had it felt good to flaunt him around the bar. And while he\u2019d looked good every time she\u2019d seen him, he looked especially good tonight, wearing a white button-down shirt with his tie loosened in that way that made her want to pull it all the way off and throw it on her bedroom floor. Or any bedroom floor.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Drew.\u201d</p><p>Maddie grabbed her arm as she tried to walk back toward Drew and dragged her over to the bar.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay? Between you two, I mean.\u201d</p><p>Alexa smiled and shrugged.</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>Maddie raised one eyebrow. Damn, did she hate that Maddie could do that. She\u2019d spent hours in front of the bathroom mirror as a teenager trying to figure out how to do it, with no luck.</p><p>The biggest problem with it was whenever Maddie did it to her, it worked.</p><p>\u201cLast week . . . we had a fight. I started it\u2014well, we both said stupid things, but I started it. He definitely made it worse, though. Anyway, we made up. And no, he\u2019s not sleeping with anyone else.\u201d</p><p>Maddie grinned and took a sip of her weak gin and tonic.</p><p>\u201cExcellent. So . . . back together, then?\u201d</p><p>Alexa laughed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if \u2018together\u2019 is the right word. How about, I\u2019m back to trying to not overthink things. I\u2019m just . . . happy he\u2019s here right now, Mads. And that he seems happy to be here. With me. I\u2019m going to enjoy being happy for now, okay?\u201d</p><p>Maddie handed her a drink and clinked their glasses together.</p><p>\u201cI am one hundred percent in favor of you being happy.\u201d</p><p>She walked back over to Drew to find him deep in conversation with Nate. She turned to go ask Theo if he needed another drink, but before she could move away, Drew\u2019s arm slid around her waist and secured her to his side. It turned out she didn\u2019t even mind douchey Nate so much when she had Drew\u2019s arm around her and his warm body against hers.</p><p>After a few minutes, she saw Maddie whisper something in Theo\u2019s ear. Weird to see Theo and Maddie being friendly; they\u2019d only ever barely tolerated each other before.</p><p>\u201cHey, Nate, what was that bourbon you wanted me to try?\u201d Theo asked a few seconds later.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s behind the bar. Let me go with you to show you. I brought it back from my trip to Kentucky. There are only a hundred cases of it produced a year. You\u2019re lucky that I . . .\u201d As they walked away, Theo turned back to her and winked.</p><p>She turned to Drew to make fun of Nate, but his mind was elsewhere.</p><p>\u201cAs much as I like your friends,\u201d he said, his fingers stroking her waist, \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in two weeks, and I\u2019ve missed you. You think we can take off anytime soon?\u201d</p><p>She should probably play it cool, right? Not show how much she couldn\u2019t wait to be alone with him, how delighted she was that he\u2019d told her he missed her; not admit how much she\u2019d missed him, too, and that she desperately wanted to be naked in a bed\u2014or out of a bed\u2014with him. Not jump when he said how high. Yes, she absolutely should play it cool.</p><p>\u201cGive me thirty seconds to get my jacket and tell Maddie I\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like that jacket,\u201d Drew said as they stood outside, after summoning a ride by pressing a button on his phone.</p><p>She zipped it up against the frigid San Francisco summer night.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Maddie made me wear it tonight.\u201d The way he was looking at her, she owed Maddie a bottle of wine for forcing her into this outfit. She remembered the bottles Maddie had brought over to her house after she\u2019d sent those ill-fated text messages. Okay, maybe she owed Maddie a few bottles of wine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like it even more if you were naked underneath it.\u201d He played with the zipper, running it up and down while his eyes followed his fingers. She shivered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow much would you like it?\u201d She stared at his fingers moving along her chest. She wanted him to stop and linger, but he just kept up that slow movement. Had she thought it was cold tonight? If she stood there with him any longer, she\u2019d get so hot she would combust.</p><p>\u201cMmmm.\u201d He took her hand and let her feel how much this was getting to him, too. \u201cThis much, I think. What do you think about that?\u201d</p><p>She moved her fingers up and down over him like he was doing to her. She was gratified to hear his intake of breath.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019d better get to your hotel as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>All Drew wanted was to make out with Alexa in the back seat like teenagers. Unfortunately, they had the chattiest driver ever, and Drew was drawn into conversation with him despite himself. By the end of the ride, their new friend Miguel had given them the address of his favorite taco truck and his theories on gentrification.</p><p>Alexa giggled as they got on the elevator.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He pretended to scowl and pushed her against the back of the elevator. She didn\u2019t resist and kept laughing.</p><p>\u201cYou say I\u2019m the politician, and yet tonight you bonded with our driver and had a long conversation with Nate, of all people. I think your whole sour-face thing the weekend of the wedding was all pretense.\u201d</p><p>He held on to her arm and trapped her against the wall.</p><p>\u201cKeep talking like that, and I can\u2019t promise what will happen. Interesting things happen to us in elevators, you know.\u201d</p><p>She licked his neck, bit down, and licked again. Had he really planned to never see this girl again?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m growing to like elevators quite a bit,\u201d she said as the doors opened for his floor.</p><p>He fumbled in his pocket for the door key and realized two things. One: he wanted to pick her up and throw her on his bed again. Two: he really had to pee. Shit. He\u2019d better make it quick.</p><p>He pulled her inside the room.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move. Give me one second. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d He flew into the bathroom and hoped that the look on her face hadn\u2019t been irritation or\u2014oh God\u2014a change of heart. Maybe she\u2019d remembered she was mad at him? That thought made him zip his pants quickly, in case he had to convince her to stay.</p><p>When he opened the door, she wasn\u2019t standing in the entryway where he\u2019d left her. She hadn\u2019t left, had she? He looked around the room and . . . holy shit.</p><p>She was propped up against the pillows on the bed, wearing that leather jacket, those heels . . . and nothing else. He unbuckled his belt.</p><p>\u201cI thought I told you not to move?\u201d he asked her as he approached the bed.</p><p>She nodded, her fingers zipping and unzipping the jacket like he\u2019d done earlier.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true. You did tell me that. But you also told me you wanted to see me in this jacket and nothing else. Do you want me to put my clothes back on?\u201d</p><p>He dropped his pants to the floor and stepped out of them, kicking off his shoes in the process.</p><p>\u201cOver my dead body.\u201d He crawled onto the bed and straddled her. He grabbed her hands and pulled them away from that zipper. She watched him play with it for a while, as her hands ran up and down his body. Then, without any warning, she pulled off his tie and threw it onto the floor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to do that all night.\u201d</p> <p>He unzipped the jacket all the way, rolled over, and pulled her on top of him. She sighed and leaned against his chest. He loved the way she always relaxed into his arms whenever he touched her. Even at the bar, when they hadn\u2019t seen each other for two weeks and he knew she was mad at him, as soon as he\u2019d pulled her against him, her body had molded to his.</p><p>\u201cI missed this,\u201d she said.</p><p>He turned them both over so he was on top of her again and kissed her in that hollow between her breasts that he loved so much.</p><p>\u201cDid you miss this? Or did you miss . . . me?\u201d</p><p>She opened her eyes and held his gaze for a long moment.</p><p>\u201cBoth.\u201d</p><p>He smiled.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I wanted you to tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have too many clothes on.\u201d Alexa unbuttoned his shirt all the way. He pulled it and his undershirt off and threw them across the room.</p><p>\u201cI was in too much of a hurry to take them all off,\u201d he said.</p><p>She pushed him onto his back and enjoyed the sensation of the warm, firm skin of his chest under her fingers. It wasn\u2019t like she\u2019d forgotten how much she liked having sex with him\u2014that was impossible to forget. But somehow, she\u2019d forgotten how free she felt with him. How she could relax enough to lie naked on his bed in only a leather jacket and high heels and wait for him. She\u2019d never been this confident with anyone else.</p><p>\u201cDrew?\u201d She paused as her hand ventured lower on his body. \u201cYou do have condoms, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He grinned without opening his eyes.</p><p>\u201cThe same box I bought the last time I was in a hotel room in San Francisco with you. I didn\u2019t take it out of my bag.\u201d He opened his eyes. \u201cWhy, is there something else you\u2019ve been missing?\u201d</p><p>She caressed his hips, and he closed his eyes again.</p><p>\u201cMmmmhmmmm,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell me what that is, or am I going to have to guess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm, I think you should guess. But be quick about it. I\u2019ve been missing . . . it so much. Everything feels so . . .\u201d She rubbed his chest again, up and down, and stopped just at the base of his stomach. \u201cSo sensitive. I feel like I\u2019m going to explode for needing . . . it.\u201d</p><p>When he opened his eyes, the need on his face almost pushed her back against the bed. He jumped off the bed and dove for his luggage, coming up a few seconds later with a triumphant look on his face and a box of condoms.</p><p>\u201cOh, I have a guess.\u201d He dropped the box on the nightstand and tore open a condom packet as he stood next to the bed and looked at her. \u201cI\u2019m going to guess over and over again. All night long and most of the day tomorrow. We have to make up for lost time.\u201d</p><p>The next morning, Alexa sat back against the plush pillows of the hotel bed and watched him pour coffee from the room service carafe into her mug. He added one sugar and handed it to her before pouring his own.</p><p>She beamed down at her mug. She couldn\u2019t help it. He remembered how she took her coffee. She cupped her hands around the mug and let the warmth spread through her body.</p><p>He got in bed next to her and pulled the basket of pastries up to join them.</p><p>\u201cOne of the best things about hotels,\u201d he said, \u201cis that you can get crumbs in the bed without worrying about it. I know it\u2019s no doughnut, but do you want the bear claw?\u201d</p><p>He turned toward her halfway through his raspberry Danish.</p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s going on with your program for teenagers? The arts thing?\u201d</p><p>She paused midway through pouring herself more coffee to smile at him. Wow, did it feel good for him to care enough to ask about that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m cautiously optimistic. The goal is to get it on the city council calendar for mid-July. Keep your fingers crossed.\u201d</p><p>He tore the top off the blueberry muffin and offered her half.</p><p>\u201cGreat, will do.\u201d He held up two crossed fingers and poured her more coffee.</p><p>\u201cI saw Abby and Jack the other day, by the way. She told me about how much you\u2019re helping them. Thanks for that.\u201d He leaned over to kiss her. His lips were sprinkled with sugar. Perfect.</p><p>\u201cWhen do we have to be out of here?\u201d She looked around him to the clock radio on the bedside table. \u201cIt\u2019s almost ten. Wait, when\u2019s your flight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwelve thirty, but I can change it, like I . . .\u201d His voice trailed away as he turned away from her to pick up his phone. \u201cI can change to the flight at eight tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that works.\u201d She was glad he looked back down at his phone and couldn\u2019t see how wide her smile was.</p><p>He moved the pastry basket to the foot of the bed and put his arm around her.</p><p>\u201cLast night . . . you didn\u2019t say whether you were sleeping with anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She hadn\u2019t expected him to bring this up again. And her whole \u201cdon\u2019t overthink it\u201d motto certainly wouldn\u2019t have let her do it. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood.\u201d He smiled and leaned down to kiss her, but she pulled away. Now that he had brought it up . . .</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want this to be . . . but when you said you weren\u2019t sleeping with anyone else, did you mean . . . I know you meant the \u2018not at the moment\u2019 thing as a joke, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>He kissed her cheek and pulled her against him.</p><p>\u201cWhat I mean by that is that you\u2019re the only person I\u2019ve slept with since I met you in that elevator, and that as long as we\u2019re doing this thing, that will remain the case. Okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs long as we\u2019re doing this thing\u201d rang in her ears. She knew it meant there was a time limit on their relationship, such as it was. But she didn\u2019t want to push this conversation too far; she didn\u2019t want to fight with him and spoil it all again, so she buried those misgivings.</p><p>She rested her head on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his hand to her cheek and rested it there for a moment before turning her toward him for a long, slow kiss.</p><p>\u201cNow, let\u2019s make good use of our last hour of this hotel room, shall we?\u201d</p> <p>When Alexa got in Drew\u2019s car at LAX the following Saturday morning, he kissed her for so long that airport security banged on his window to move him along. Oops.</p><p>\u201cHow was the event last night?\u201d he said when he finally drove away from the curb. The mayor had had a big charity event the night before, so Alexa couldn\u2019t fly down until Saturday morning. Drew was on call that night, so he couldn\u2019t fly up.</p><p>\u201cIt went well, I think. I haven\u2019t had a chance to check to see what the press said about it. I crashed when I got home, and the Wi-Fi was broken on the plane.\u201d She settled against the seat and grinned at him. \u201cIs one of those coffee cups for me?\u201d</p><p>He lifted the coffee he\u2019d gotten her out of the cup holder and handed it to her.</p><p>\u201cThe drive from the coffee shop to the airport should have cooled it down enough for your delicate tongue.\u201d</p><p>She lifted the coffee halfway up, paused, and opened her mouth. He laughed.</p> <p>\u201cI love that you\u2019re going to make that joke, but I just meant you\u2019re always complaining about coffee being too hot.\u201d</p><p>She smirked and put her purse on the floor in front of her before she took a sip. Then she looked up at him.</p><p>\u201cHey, Drew?\u201d</p><p>He fought back a smile. He knew what was coming.</p><p>\u201cHey, Alexa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in this bag right here?\u201d she asked, pointing to the waxy paper bag at her feet. They both knew what was inside.</p><p>He didn\u2019t fight his smile anymore.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you open it up and see?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoughnuts! And they\u2019re still warm? How did you manage that? You\u2019re my hero.\u201d She\u2019d bitten into one almost before she finished that sentence. He looked over to see pure bliss on her face and grinned. The only other time her face looked like that was right after sex. Maybe he needed to work to keep that look on her face more often.</p><p>Thank God for that conference. He was so glad this woman was back in his life.</p><p>On the way back to his apartment, they drove by the Santa Monica Pier.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been there since I was a kid,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was always so fun.\u201d</p><p>An SUV pulled out of a parking spot ahead of him, and he made a snap decision.</p><p>\u201cNo time like the present.\u201d He reversed into the spot and grabbed her hand. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>When they got back to his apartment, they were both giddy, sunburned, and exhausted. They\u2019d ridden the rides, played arcade games, eaten too much, and laughed even more. They\u2019d even goaded each other into temporary tattoos\u2014she\u2019d gotten a flower on her cheek; he\u2019d gotten an anchor on his bicep. Before they\u2019d come back to his apartment, she\u2019d made him run down into the water with her and shrieked when he splashed her.</p><p>They dropped down onto his couch as soon as they walked in the door. She leaned her head against his shoulder, and he pulled her tighter against him. She curled her legs up on the couch so that her body was tucked against his. He wanted to drag her into the bedroom for a long afternoon sex session, or even just have her here on the couch again. But right now they were so comfortable. He\u2019d wait just a few minutes.</p><p>He woke up when the afternoon sun came through his kitchen windows and hit him in the eye. They\u2019d somehow moved in their sleep to lying almost flat on the couch, but her head was still tucked in the nook of his shoulder, and his arm was still tight around her. He could stay like this for another few hours.</p><p>His stomach rumbled.</p><p>Oh, right. Except for that. The hot dogs and cotton candy from the pier couldn\u2019t hold him forever.</p><p>She squeezed her eyes together and stirred, turning into his chest, away from the light. She kissed his chest as she snuggled against him, and the warmth from her casual caress spread through his body.</p><p>\u201cMmmngry,\u201d she said into his collarbone.</p><p>\u201cHmmm?\u201d He stroked her hair away from her face. Remnants of the flower were still on her cheek. He rubbed at it with his thumb.</p><p>She lifted her head a few centimeters.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you talked me into this flower. I\u2019m sure I look ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>He smiled down at her, her cheek pink and creased from being against his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful.\u201d</p><p>She pulled his head down to hers and kissed him, her hands in his hair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry,\u201d she said against his lips. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and ran his hands over her hair to her back, and then again. A woman after his own heart.</p><p>\u201cStarving. What\u2019s your feeling on burgers and fries? We should probably eat here instead of going out, since I\u2019m on call tonight . . .\u201d</p><p>She kissed his collarbone again.</p><p>\u201cI have very positive feelings about burgers and fries. Eating here is perfect, since I accidentally glued myself to this couch.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her ear to make her giggle and rolled out from underneath her and stood up.</p><p>\u201cGood thing you have me. I\u2019ll go pick them up and bring them back here while you try desperately to unglue yourself.\u201d</p><p>So they ate their burgers on the couch while they watched terrible movies on Netflix and kept their fingers crossed that he wouldn\u2019t have to go into the hospital.</p><p>It was probably a real risk to pull her into the bedroom . . . but he was on call until six in the morning. Was he supposed to not have sex with her tonight?</p><p>Afterward, damp and panting, he reached blindly for his phone to make sure he hadn\u2019t missed a call. Just then it rang.</p><p>He kissed her hard and jumped out of bed after he got off the phone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to go. Keep the bed warm for me, okay?\u201d</p><p>She turned and looked up at him with that smile that always made his heart turn over.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be here when you get back,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m counting on it.\u201d</p><p>It took Alexa a while to fall asleep after he left. It wasn\u2019t like she wasn\u2019t used to sleeping alone. But she missed him next to her.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t admit this to anyone other than herself, and then only late at night, but ever since that first weekend with him, every night when she lay in bed she imagined him there with her. Even those nights right after their stupid fight. She would think of his strong arms around her, hear his slow, steady breathing, feel his chest rise and fall, and his warm body against hers, and it all lulled her to sleep. It felt silly to do it there in his bed alone, but she did it anyway.</p><p>She woke up in the middle of the night to feel him pull her against him. When his arms were around her, she felt like nothing else mattered. Like nothing bad could ever touch her.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He kissed her forehead.</p><p>\u201cIt is now. Go back to sleep.\u201d</p><p>After a lazy day on the beach the next day, they went out for Mexican food Sunday night. She took a sip of her margarita, and her lips puckered at the salty/sweet tang of the drink. She took a bite of a salsa-laden chip and smiled. Chips and salsa were tied up there with cheese and crackers for the perfect snack food. Maybe not as perfect for being stuck in an elevator, but . . . He interrupted her tequila-influenced musings.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not on call next weekend, so I can come up.\u201d He paused. \u201cIf that works for you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She licked the salt from the corner of her mouth and noticed his eyes follow the movement of her tongue. She smiled and did it again.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that works for me.\u201d</p><p>She got to the office the next day, feeling much more wide awake than any woman who\u2019d been on a seven a.m. flight from LAX had any reason to be. But when she had a wake-up call like Drew\u2019s . . . well, that was going to keep her awake all day.</p><p>Theo poked his head in her door on his way into the office.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to ask how your weekend was; that look on your face says it all.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks got hot, and she tried to tone down her smile, but when Theo plopped in her chair and handed her a doughnut, it blossomed again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try to pull myself together by staff meeting.\u201d</p><p>Theo bit into his own doughnut and took a sip of her coffee. They\u2019d long ago started taking coffee the same way to simplify their lives.</p><p>\u201cYou going to see him again? Or is that an \u2018of course\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>She tried not to let her smile take over her whole face but probably failed.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s coming up this weekend.\u201d</p><p>She switched the conversation to work so she wouldn\u2019t get carried away.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think the press will say about my program? Who are we targeting to leak about it? Or do you think an interview?\u201d</p><p>Theo stood up.</p><p>\u201cThat reminds me,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to name this thing. It needs a good terrible acronym.\u201d</p> <p>Just then, the mayor poked his head in Alexa\u2019s office.</p><p>\u201cThought I\u2019d find you both here. Just wanted to let you know Richards is against the delinquent project. He fought me on it at dinner this weekend.\u201d</p><p>Shit. Richards was the city councilman from the Berkeley Hills, and a good friend of the mayor\u2019s. She opened her mouth to defend her project, point by point, when the mayor stopped her.</p><p>\u201cAlexa. You don\u2019t need to argue with me on this. I\u2019m on your side; this is our program now. I\u2019m just telling you what we\u2019re up against and what work has to be done. Just huddle with Theo and figure out a plan, okay?\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>Drew had driven straight to the hospital after dropping Alexa off at the airport. Even though that gave him plenty of time to get through his pile of stupid paperwork, he didn\u2019t get much done.</p><p>Usually when he got home in the middle of the night after a stressful surgery he felt exhausted and wrung dry. But Saturday night when he\u2019d walked into his bedroom and seen her there in his bed, he\u2019d felt a sense of homecoming that he hadn\u2019t felt in years. And when he\u2019d wrapped his arms around her and she\u2019d curled her body against his, his whole self had felt at peace.</p> <p>He shook his head in an attempt to pull himself back to earth, or at least to his office. Why was he being such a teenager over this one girl? He was acting like this was the first girl he\u2019d ever slept with.</p><p>He was going to have to break up with her soon. If he didn\u2019t, he\u2019d invariably do something to fuck it all up again. How terrible would it be when she looked at him with loathing in her eyes instead of that smile?</p><p>He couldn\u2019t end things yet, though. They\u2019d just started back up again. Maybe after this coming weekend.</p><p>He\u2019d settled back in with the paperwork when his phone buzzed. He snatched at it, but it was just Carlos asking if he wanted anything from Starbucks.</p><p>Large with a shot of espresso.</p><p>He\u2019d already had coffee with Alexa this morning, but after not a lot of sleep and getting up early to go to the airport, he\u2019d need more caffeine than usual today.</p><p>As Carlos walked into his office, his phone buzzed again. This time, it was her.</p><p>Landed, but there were no doughnuts waiting for me at Oakland airport, terrible way to get off a plane.</p><p>He laughed down at his phone and looked up to see that smirk on Carlos\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cGood weekend, I take it?\u201d</p><p>He picked up his coffee and took a sip.</p><p>\u201cYou can stop gloating anytime now. Yes, yes, you told me so.\u201d</p><p>Carlos grinned.</p><p>\u201cAs long as you remember that. When\u2019re you seeing her again?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cThis weekend I\u2019m going up there.\u201d Carlos\u2019s grin got bigger. \u201cDon\u2019t give me that look! Don\u2019t make a big deal out of this!\u201d</p><p>Carlos rolled his eyes as he left the room.</p><p>Alexa and Theo and their deputies huddled and came up with an acronym (Teen Arts Rehabilitation Program, or TARP, a name she and Theo knew they\u2019d be mocked about forever), a deadline (the city council meeting in July), and a schedule of community meetings to hopefully garner support. This all meant Alexa was at work until eight or nine the whole week, and spent a few more hours working at home on her couch every night.</p><p>She probably would have worked a few hours less that week if she hadn\u2019t been texting with Drew in between every meeting, but she couldn\u2019t help it. His texts always made her smile, made her relax after tense moments, and sometimes made her blush.</p><p>Him being so far away was starting to make her go crazy. Why couldn\u2019t she drive straight to his house from one of her long workdays to get rid of some of her frustration in the best possible way? Why couldn\u2019t she wake up with him in her bed in the mornings, so at least she\u2019d have those five minutes before she pulled herself out of the warm circle of his arms to feel content and at peace?</p><p>Text messages were great and all, but . . . well, she was happy he was coming up this weekend.</p><p>Drew loved feeling the buzz in his pocket and knowing it was her, that anticipation of reading what she\u2019d said throughout the day, the smile she always put on his face. And he really loved the texts they sent each other late at night . . . and sometimes referred to throughout the day.</p><p>He told her about the baby who peed on him, causing both him and the baby\u2019s dad to double over with laughter; the five-year-old twins who both broke their arms when they jumped off the roof \u201cjust to see if they could\u201d; the little girl who swallowed a penny during a temper tantrum and giggled uncontrollably when she saw it on her X-ray.</p><p>One day she had a meeting that he could tell stressed her out from just the length of her first text.</p><p>The good news is that my boss is firmly behind the project, and that is really good news . . . but the bad news is that some other important people aren\u2019t, and this is going to be a fight. I\u2019m thrilled about the first thing but kind of freaking out about the second.</p><p>He tucked his files under his arm so he could respond.</p><p>That\u2019s awesome about your boss. You were worried, right?</p><p>Her response came a few seconds later.</p><p>Yeah, I was. Never realized he trusted me this much! But now I feel like I have to fight even harder.</p><p>He sat down on the exam room table to think about his response.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know anything about city politics in Berkeley other than what she\u2019d told him. It wasn\u2019t like he could give her good or useful advice when she knew everything and he knew virtually nothing. All he could give her was his support, which felt like it didn\u2019t matter. He thought about texting, You can do it! but that felt stupid.</p><p>He\u2019s lucky to have you in his corner.</p><p>That was all he came up with. It didn\u2019t feel good enough.</p><p>Her response took enough time that he wondered if he\u2019d gotten it totally wrong. He walked down the hall to his office. His phone buzzed just as he set his files down at his desk.</p><p>That means so much, thank you. I really appreciate it.</p><p>At first, he tried to keep himself from grinning at his phone. But Carlos wasn\u2019t around to gloat or make fun of him, so he stopped trying and smiled so hard his cheeks hurt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I had to work all weekend,\u201d Alexa said as she drove him to the airport on Sunday night.</p><p>\u201cNot all weekend,\u201d he said, his eyebrows dancing. She poked him and laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean! Anyway, I know it was a boring weekend. I wish we could have gone out and done more, but these next few weeks are going to be so . . .\u201d Just thinking about everything riding on her work made her anxious all over again.</p><p>He put his hand on her thigh. That got her attention in more than one way. His hand there, so big and strong and firm and gentle, made her think of all of the other places his hands had been that weekend. She blushed as she looked down at it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMonroe, stop apologizing. I had a great time with you. Hanging out on the couch together was fine. I know you have a lot going on. I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t want me to cancel my trip in the first place.\u201d</p><p>She put her hand on top of his and held it in place. No matter how much work she had, it had never occurred to her to ask him to cancel.</p><p>\u201cI just wish I hadn\u2019t been on my laptop or on the phone with Theo half the time you were here.\u201d Was he mad about that? He hadn\u2019t seemed mad, but a few times when Theo had called and she\u2019d picked up, he\u2019d left the room.</p><p>He turned his hand over and interlaced his fingers with hers.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. We\u2019ll have next time. It sucks that we can\u2019t do next weekend, though.\u201d</p><p>She had community meetings both Saturday and Sunday, and he was on call, so he couldn\u2019t fly up. It was for the best, anyway; her cousin Becca\u2019s engagement party was on Friday night, and it wasn\u2019t like she could bring him along with her to that. They had a sex-up-against-her-bedroom-wall kind of relationship, not a come-meet-my-family kind of relationship.</p><p>But she was really sad about not being able to see him for two weeks. She felt a little panicky about how sad she was.</p><p>And even though he seemed like he was sad about it, too, she still had \u201cas long as we\u2019re doing this thing\u201d echoing in her head.</p><p>She moved her hand back to the steering wheel.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how you\u2019re going to survive without me for two whole weeks. Maybe Carlos will make fun of how much sugar you put in your coffee and how you can\u2019t handle spicy food, just to keep you on your toes.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and moved his hand off her knee. Hmmm. Just because she\u2019d let go of his hand didn\u2019t mean she wanted him to move it.</p><p>\u201cYou and Carlos have only met each other twice. How is it that you\u2019re so in tune? He\u2019ll do that without any prompting. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her hard when she pulled up at the curb.</p><p>\u201cSee you in two weeks?\u201d he asked, as his fingers stroked her cheek.</p><p>When he looked into her eyes like that, she would say yes to anything he asked her. Do you want to rob a Vegas casino with me, I promise it\u2019s for a good cause? Let\u2019s go skydiving! Tell me all of your deepest and darkest secrets. She\u2019d have said yes to it all.</p> <p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><p>Drew took a picture of the cheese and cracker plate he\u2019d bought at the airport and texted it to Alexa when he got on the plane.</p><p>Don\u2019t you wish you were sharing this with me?</p><p>He\u2019d had such a good time with Alexa that weekend. This thing obviously couldn\u2019t last that much longer, but why mess with a good thing? Ever since they\u2019d gotten back together, being with her had been so relaxed and fun. It felt so comfortable. Maybe a little too comfortable?</p><p>Perhaps it was good that he wasn\u2019t going to see her for two weeks. It made everything easier. More low-key. This was why she was the perfect person for him to date\u2014she lived on the opposite end of the state, she had a super busy job, and they couldn\u2019t see each other that often. And when they did see each other, it was great. See, perfect.</p><p>He laughed when the flight landed and a text from her lit up his screen.</p><p>You ate me out of house and home this weekend, Nichols . . . and cheese and crackers.</p><p>Accompanying the text was a picture of three open and empty cracker boxes and a cheese rind.</p> <p>He put his phone back in his pocket, still smiling.</p><p>He ignored the weight in his chest at the thought of not seeing her smile for fourteen days. It was probably just all of that cheese.</p><p>Theo narrowed his eyes at her when she walked in on Monday morning.</p><p>\u201cCoffee. Let\u2019s go.\u201d He had her outside before she could even put her purse down.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked, as soon as they were far enough away from the building so they wouldn\u2019t be overheard. \u201cWere things bad this weekend? Was Drew an ass about you needing to work?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. Had her poker face gotten that bad or did Theo know her that well?</p><p>\u201cNo, he was great. He was great about everything. It\u2019s just . . . we\u2019re both busy next weekend, so it\u2019s going to be a little while before we see each other again, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>There were too many people they knew inside the coffee shop, so after they\u2019d gotten their coffee, he steered her in the opposite direction of City Hall.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been seeing each other every weekend, right?\u201d Theo asked her.</p><p>She shrugged.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I mean, we hadn\u2019t planned on it that way. It just sort of happened.\u201d She avoided his eyes.</p><p>He tore off a piece of his pastry and handed it to her.</p><p>\u201cThis thing seems to be getting kind of serious. Have you guys talked about what\u2019s going on between you two?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. All she wanted was coffee. Why did she have to get the third degree? She was irritated with Theo for bringing this up, irritated with herself that tears had popped into her eyes. She blew into her coffee cup so Theo couldn\u2019t see them.</p><p>\u201cNah, it\u2019s just fun. It\u2019s not like it can go anywhere. He doesn\u2019t really do serious. Plus, I don\u2019t think either of us can keep up this kind of travel schedule for too long. My finances certainly aren\u2019t up to many more plane tickets. I\u2019m just going to enjoy it while it lasts.\u201d</p><p>Theo was still looking at her. She took a sip of too-hot coffee to brace herself and winced. She looked back up at him with what she hoped looked like a genuine smile.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He stopped on the corner, forcing her to stop, too. \u201cIf you say so. I\u2019m just worried that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheo. Enough.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t meant to snap at him. She never snapped at Theo. But she couldn\u2019t handle this conversation anymore. She didn\u2019t want to think about this, let alone talk about it. She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Teddy, I\u2019m sorry. I just can\u2019t do this right now, okay?\u201d</p><p>He threw an arm around her shoulder and pulled her into a side hug.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. But you know, if you ever want to talk . . .\u201d</p><p>She leaned into the hug.</p><p>\u201cI know. Now, let\u2019s go get our TARP off the ground.\u201d</p><p>Theo groaned. She laughed.</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t you worry, I\u2019m going to make so many jokes like that in the next few weeks. It\u2019s going to be great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve sure been in a shitty mood this week,\u201d Carlos said as they walked to their cars after basketball on Wednesday night. \u201cI can\u2019t wait for you to see Alexa this weekend so you stop knocking people down on the court.\u201d</p><p>Drew threw his gym bag in the trunk of his car.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t knock that guy down! I dove for the ball, and he happened to be in the way.\u201d</p><p>Carlos laughed at him and leaned against Drew\u2019s car, which prevented him from driving away in a huff. He could still do it; he\u2019d just maybe back over his best friend. Which, given the way Carlos had been annoying him this week . . .</p><p>\u201cYou going up there this weekend or is she coming down? If she\u2019s coming here, you should bring her to Angie\u2019s party. It\u2019ll be a blast.\u201d</p><p>He should definitely back over him.</p><p>\u201cNeither.\u201d He opened his door and waited for Carlos to take the hint and get in his own car.</p><p>He didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, neither? Neither what?\u201d</p><p>Drew sighed. Now Carlos was going to make a big deal about this.</p><p>\u201cNeither going up nor coming down, is what I mean. We\u2019re not seeing each other this weekend. Other commitments.\u201d</p><p>There, that was easy, right? He got in the car, but before he could shut the door, Carlos grabbed it.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re so crabby this week! You\u2019re not seeing your girl this weekend.\u201d</p><p>Drew shook his head.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p><p>Carlos shut the door on him, but he could hear Carlos yelling anyway.</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t even try to say she\u2019s not your girl!\u201d</p><p>She missed Drew even more that week than she\u2019d thought she would. It was weird to miss him so much on a Wednesday. They never saw each other on Wednesdays. But somehow just knowing that it would be another full week and a half before she saw him made it that much harder to be alone on her couch that night. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She looked over to the opposite end of the couch, picturing him there the way he\u2019d been the weekend before. It had been so comfortable\u2014her on her laptop, him half watching the basketball game and half reading through the pile of medical journal articles in his lap; not talking, just being together. Sometimes she would read part of her city council presentation out loud and he would help her wordsmith it, or ask her questions that made her realize she was using too much jargon and needed to simplify. She hadn\u2019t realized how helpful he could be.</p><p>Periodically, one of them would get up to fetch drinks or snacks for both of them. They\u2019d share a quick kiss as they both settled back in to work . . . well, okay, sometimes the kisses hadn\u2019t been so quick, but only sometimes. She\u2019d worried that he\u2019d been bored, but then if he\u2019d been bored, he wouldn\u2019t want her to go down there for 4th of July weekend, right?</p><p>She picked up her phone to text him but put it back down. It wasn\u2019t like she couldn\u2019t text him at all\u2014they\u2019d been texting each other plenty for the past few days\u2014but in the maudlin mood she was in, she\u2019d probably say, Drew, I miss you, I wish I was seeing you this weekend, I\u2019m counting the days until I see you next. Which . . . that was all true, but some things she didn\u2019t need to share with him. Or anyone else.</p><p>At Drew\u2019s sister Angela\u2019s party on Saturday night, Drew kept thinking about how much more fun it would be if Alexa was there with him. He tried to shake that thought off. He wasn\u2019t drinking, because he was on call; that was probably why he was so irritable.</p> <p>But his irritation washed away when his phone buzzed in his pocket. He grinned at the text from her: a picture of a pile of doughnuts, arranged and stacked like a wedding cake.</p><p>Look at what they had at the community meeting!</p><p>He walked into the hallway to text her back.</p><p>They obviously don\u2019t know you that well. None of them have sprinkles.</p><p>After two more texts, he gave up on the party and disappeared out the back door to get to his car. He called her before his car was out of park.</p> <p>\u201cHey!\u201d she said, that warm sound of laughter in her voice. Was she laughing because of his texts, or was she out with other people?</p><p>\u201cHey! How was the meeting other than the doughnuts?\u201d</p><p>He heard noise and chatter in the background. When she said a muffled, \u201cBe right back,\u201d the noise receded. So she was with other people.</p><p>Not that she wasn\u2019t allowed to go out when he wasn\u2019t there, but he\u2019d sort of pictured her sitting home on the couch missing him.</p><p>\u201cIt went really well, I think! I hope we have lots of parents and teachers on our side. Getting drinks with Theo and some others from work now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great. How many people were there?\u201d</p> <p>She gushed for a few more minutes about the meeting, before he heard a muffled voice saying, \u201cAlexa! Another margarita?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like you should go,\u201d he didn\u2019t want to say but said anyway.</p><p>She laughed again, clearly in a great mood.</p><p>\u201cProbably, otherwise they\u2019ll drink all of the tequila without me. Talk to you later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, talk to you later.\u201d</p><p>Why wasn\u2019t he there with her and stupid Theo and her great mood right now? He should be there, to see that laughter on her face in person, to hug her after a good night, to throw his arm around her when she was relaxed and tipsy after a few margaritas and the high that comes from a job well done.</p><p>He was almost relieved to get a call from the hospital a few minutes later to get his mind off her.</p><p>Alexa woke up with a smile on her face on Sunday morning, after the meeting at the church on Saturday night and Drew\u2019s unexpected phone call. They almost never called each other\u2014they mostly communicated via text or occasionally email. Maybe he\u2019d missed her that weekend like she\u2019d missed him?</p> <p>But the smile got wiped off her face on Sunday afternoon. There was another community meeting in the Berkeley Hills about her program, and everyone there hated it. Well, they all pretended to like it, with all sorts of platitudes about how it would be a great thing if programs like this one worked, and how they cared so much about troubled children, and how great it was that the mayor had come up with such a creative plan.</p><p>The problem was that all of those sentences had a great big BUT in the middle of them: but how do we know this would work; but these kids would be out on the street and still in school; but they\u2019d influence other kids in school and turn them to a life of crime; but shouldn\u2019t we put city resources into programs for young children so we could make sure they stayed on the right track in the first place; and on and on and on.</p><p>She\u2019d prepared for this, of course. And the mayor had a list of talking points with answers to all of those questions. But she still felt deflated when she left.</p><p>She wished, not for the first time, that this program wasn\u2019t so important to her. That she didn\u2019t have so much of her own history and identity and absolution and vindication tied up in this one effort. She wished that this was just a regular run-of-the-mill project, like the playgrounds or the bike lanes or the farmers\u2019 market expansions, not one where, if this effort failed, she would feel like she\u2019d failed her whole family.</p><p>She wanted to go home and call Drew and spill all of this out to him. She almost did, especially after his out-of-the-blue call from the night before.</p><p>But though they\u2019d talked about a lot in the past month and a half, they hadn\u2019t gotten that personal. She didn\u2019t know if they had that kind of relationship yet. Or if they would ever. What if he checked out after she spilled her guts to him? Could she handle that?</p><p>Probably not. And that was the problem. She wanted him waiting for her when she got home; she wanted to talk to him about everything she was feeling; she wanted him to listen, to ask her questions, to reassure her, to tuck her into his chest and wrap his arms around her. But she knew none of those things were going to happen. She had to remember that.</p><p>She tried to push those wants down into the depths of her brain and stopped for ice cream on the way home instead.</p><p>Tuesday afternoon, Drew had a follow-up appointment with Jack. Only Abby was with him this time, and after he exchanged fist bumps with Jack, she turned to him.</p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019s your . . . friend Alexa?\u201d</p><p>He felt like he should shut down a question like this from a patient\u2019s mom, but he was too happy to talk about Alexa to someone who wouldn\u2019t make fun of him later that he couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s great. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll want me to say hi to you for her.\u201d He knew that her real question was whether \u201cfriend\u201d was the right word to define Alexa, but he avoided answering that. \u201cHow did Jack do with the MRI yesterday? I know you were worried.\u201d</p><p>She patted Jack on the head. \u201cHe handled it with flying colors. Thanks for asking.\u201d</p><p>Drew smiled at Jack. \u201cGood job, Jacky, staying in that machine like you did. Most kids your age couldn\u2019t manage that.\u201d He turned back to Abby. \u201cI don\u2019t have his results yet, but they should have been here by now. Let me go check on that.\u201d</p><p>He found the report in his office. Read it once, then again. He ran across the hospital to find Dr. Montgomery and had him look at it, too. He sat down in his office with his eyes closed for a moment before he forced himself to walk back into the exam room.</p><p>Abby looked up from her book with a smile on her face when she saw him, but her smile dropped away. Thank God Jack had fallen asleep on the table.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>He sat down next to her and took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cDr. Nichols, what is it?\u201d</p><p>Shit, he just had to tell her. Why was doing this part of his job still so hard?</p><p>\u201cAbby. I\u2019m so sorry I kept you waiting, but I wanted to double-check a few things with another doctor here. We won\u2019t know for sure without additional testing, but there\u2019s a mass in one of Jack\u2019s lymph nodes. Initial indications are that it\u2019s cancer.\u201d</p><p>Abby went very still. She closed her book without marking the page and stared at him without a word.</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t have spit it out like that; he should have done a better job of leading up to the C word. Telling parents bad news was the worst part of his job.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already called our best pediatric oncologist for a consult, so if you can bring him back in Thursday morning, we can start doing more testing and, if necessary, come up with a plan.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She stared back at him, still without saying anything. He wanted to touch her, or Jack, or say something to reassure her. But he couldn\u2019t do any of those things.</p><p>\u201cAbby? Can I call someone? Should I call Fred?\u201d</p><p>She stood up and swayed for a second. He jumped to his feet and reached out to steady her, but she pulled back.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Can you . . . can you just have someone call me with details about the appointment on Thursday? I should take Jack home. I should call Fred. We need to . . .\u201d Her voice trailed away as she picked Jack up and carried him out of the room.</p> <p>Drew sat back down and put his head in his hands. There was probably no good way to have that conversation, but knowing that didn\u2019t make him feel any better.</p><p>When he stood up to go back to his office, he noticed Abby had left her book on the table. He tucked it in Jack\u2019s file, so it would be there for her on Thursday.</p><p>He stumbled through his next few appointments, the look on Abby\u2019s face in the forefront of his mind the whole time.</p><p>Thank God he was finished with appointments early that day. Hopefully, he could leave the office without running into anyone. He didn\u2019t want to see or talk to anyone. Well, there was one person he wanted to both see and talk to, but that was impossible. She was far away from this hospital right now.</p><p>Except . . . she wasn\u2019t that far, was she?</p> <p>He made it to his car without talking to anyone and drove straight to LAX.</p><p>Alexa was still depressed on Tuesday from the meeting on Sunday night. Even though she\u2019d huddled with Theo and the mayor on Monday morning, she was convinced they had no chance of victory, at least not this time. The people in the hills had too much influence. They were rich and white; the teens she was trying to help were poor and brown. She knew who the city council was more likely to listen to.</p><p>She got home at seven that night and shed her dress, bra, and heels as soon as she walked in the front door, too tired and discouraged to bring them into her bedroom. She changed into yoga pants and a hoodie and stood in front of the open refrigerator, a glass of wine in her hand. She really should make herself a healthy dinner with all of those vegetables she\u2019d bought at the farmers\u2019 market on Saturday morning.</p><p>Instead, she reached for the block of cheese in the drawer and brought it, a knife, and a box of crackers to the coffee table. Just as she sat down, her phone rang. She groaned. It was probably Theo, calling to tell her about a negative story that was going to be in the paper the next day, or someone from Councilman Watson\u2019s office giving her a heads-up that one of her few strong allies was going to defect. She took another swig of wine and reached for her phone anyway.</p><p>Drew. With her luck, he was calling to tell her not to come visit him this weekend. He\u2019d probably realized during the weekend off from her how nice it was to hang out with other people, or he\u2019d met some other girl after they\u2019d hung up on Saturday night . . . or maybe even before he\u2019d called.</p><p>Wait, was that why he\u2019d called on Saturday night? To break up with her? But had he decided against it since she was with people?</p> <p>She thought about letting him go to voice mail but decided to get this over with.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d She tucked herself back into her corner of the couch, wishing she\u2019d brought the whole wine bottle to the living room. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you at home?\u201d He sounded breathless. Had he just been running or something? Probably another reason why he was going to break up with her. He went running after work; she put on her yoga pants to sit on the couch with wine and cheese and crackers.</p><p>\u201cYeah, why?\u201d What she wanted to say was, Why, do you need to know so you don\u2019t break up with me when I\u2019m in public? but she managed to not blurt that out.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d he said. Her doorbell rang two seconds later. Wait, what?</p><p>She put her wineglass down and walked to the door, phone still in her hand. She saw him through the peephole with a bag over his shoulder and a tense look on his face. Damn it, she didn\u2019t even have a bra on.</p><p>She opened the door, and before she could say anything, he stepped inside and pulled her into his arms. He pushed the door closed with his elbow and leaned back against it, holding on tight, his head tucked into the curve of her neck.</p><p>She stroked his hair and kissed his ear, happier to see him than she could have thought possible. When he turned toward her, she felt dampness on his cheek.</p> <p>\u201cDrew, honey, what\u2019s wrong? What happened?\u201d She wanted to kick herself for calling him \u201choney,\u201d but it had just slipped out.</p><p>He shook his head, so they stood there for a while without speaking, their arms around each other, her fingers moving back and forth through his hair and up and down his back, his rough breathing the only noise in the hallway.</p><p>Drew lifted his head and kissed her hard. He unzipped her hoodie and breathed in deeply when he found her topless underneath it.</p><p>\u201cDo you always just walk around your house like this? I should show up with no warning more often.\u201d</p><p>He leaned down and kissed that hollow between her breasts, and felt her fingernails scrape his scalp.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t fly up here just to catch you shirtless in your house, but what a bonus,\u201d he said.</p><p>She kissed the top of his head, his cheek, his lips. He sighed and she pulled back.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you come? What\u2019s wrong? Tell me.\u201d</p><p>Drew stood up straight.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go sit down somewhere comfortable first.\u201d</p><p>Alexa looked into his eyes for a long time. When he felt the tears start to well up again, he turned away. He was already embarrassed enough that he\u2019d cried in front of her; he couldn\u2019t do it again. She took his hand. They walked into the living room and she pointed at the couch.</p><p>\u201cSit. I\u2019ll get you wine. Have you eaten? Are you hungry?\u201d</p><p>He sat, suddenly exhausted.</p><p>\u201cNo. I haven\u2019t eaten since . . . lunch? I should be hungry, but I\u2019m not really.\u201d</p><p>She tossed him her phone.</p><p>\u201cPizza place is in my favorites. Call and order whatever while I get the wine. You know what I like.\u201d</p><p>She came back with a full glass of wine in one hand and the bottle in the other just as he got off the phone. She sank down on the couch next to him and handed him the glass. He put an arm around her and felt that feeling of homecoming as she tucked her feet up on the couch and laid her head against his shoulder. This was why he\u2019d come.</p><p>He took a sip of wine and set the glass on the coffee table next to hers.</p><p>\u201cI think . . . I\u2019m pretty sure, actually, that Jack has leukemia.\u201d</p><p>She gasped and tried to sit up, but he tightened his grip around her shoulders, keeping her close to him.</p><p>\u201cOh, Drew, how terrible. When did you find out? Have you told them yet?\u201d</p><p>He kissed her hair and released her enough so she could reach her wineglass. She took a sip and grasped his hand.</p><p>\u201cThis afternoon. Yeah, I told Abby right after I found out. I think I did a terrible job of it. She looked so . . . broken.\u201d</p><p>Alexa pushed his head down onto her shoulder. He went willingly. Her fingers combed back and forth through his hair. He felt better than he had all day. Better than he\u2019d felt in over a week.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a good way of telling someone that their child has leukemia. I\u2019m sure you did as good of a job as you could.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head but didn\u2019t bother to protest any more than that. He just wanted her to keep holding on to him like that, touching him like that. He spilled out the whole story, still resting his head on her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cIt was so awful. I\u2019ve had patients with cancer before, but those times, I always knew in advance. It wasn\u2019t a kid I knew. Why am I not better at this? Why can\u2019t I feel distant and academic about it, like other doctors I know?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer him but raised his head and kissed his cheek, then his mouth. They kissed like they were just getting to know each other, like they\u2019d known each other forever. They spent the next thirty minutes like that, taking periodic breaks for sips of the red wine that went straight to his head, then coming back together, whispering soft words in between kisses. They only separated when her doorbell rang.</p><p>\u201cPizza,\u201d she said, her hand still on his cheek.</p><p>He stood up, surprised to find himself unsteady on his feet. Maybe he really did need to eat. He stumbled to the front door and found his wallet in the gym bag that he\u2019d grabbed out of his trunk in the airport parking lot. He handed the delivery guy a handful of bills and brought the pizza into the living room, just as Alexa was coming back from the kitchen with plates. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She poured herself more wine while he put pizza on their plates, and he quirked his eyebrows at her.</p><p>\u201cMy glass is empty, too, you know.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and took a sip.</p><p>\u201cNone for you until you eat something. I\u2019m not going to have you collapsing on me here from stress and too much wine and no food.\u201d</p> <p>He started to argue, but the look on her face made him realize it was futile. He dove into the pepperoni, sausage, and extra cheese pizza and had finished two slices before he reached for his wineglass again. This time, she filled it up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I descended on you without any warning,\u201d he said. \u201cI just . . . I just needed to see you. I should\u2019ve called, but . . .\u201d But he hadn\u2019t wanted to call; he hadn\u2019t wanted her to say that she had plans or was too busy and he shouldn\u2019t come.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d She put her plate down and poured herself more wine. \u201cI would have just finished this bottle on my own if you hadn\u2019t come. Glad you could join my pity party.\u201d She lifted her glass to his and he toasted her.</p><p>\u201cWhy were you having a pity party? What\u2019s wrong in Alexa world? I thought things were going well after the meeting on Saturday?\u201d</p><p>Alexa took another sip of her wine and fought the urge to lay her head on his shoulder. Then she wondered why she was fighting it. She curled up against him, and he put his arm around her.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, so did I, but Sunday there was another meeting and it was . . . different.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his hand up and down her arm.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound good. What happened?\u201d</p><p>She attempted to not sound as defeatist as she felt as she told him everything.</p><p>\u201cMonroe, this is just one group of people. You don\u2019t know that they represent everyone in the hills,\u201d he said when she was done. \u201cPlus, now you know exactly what you\u2019re up against, and this will make you all the more prepared for battle.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, buoyed by his confidence in her. Maybe she should have called him on Sunday night.</p> <p>\u201cI know, it\u2019s just . . .\u201d She took another sip of her wine and put her glass down on the table. She twisted her fingers together and didn\u2019t look at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it? Tell me.\u201d She finally looked up. He smiled at her, with such a tender, open expression on his face that she reached out and touched his cheek. He turned his head and kissed her palm. \u201cTell me what\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>Drew had always known there was something about this program that she wasn\u2019t telling him. He hadn\u2019t pushed her, hadn\u2019t wanted to push her. But now he needed her to trust him like he trusted her.</p><p>She took a deep breath and grasped his hand.</p><p>\u201cThis program, the whole idea of this program . . . it\u2019s a pretty personal one to me.\u201d She looked up at him. \u201cYou\u2019ve probably figured that out.\u201d He nodded. \u201cI . . . We . . .\u201d She sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t know where to start this story.\u201d</p><p>He lifted their joined hands and kissed the back of hers.</p><p>\u201cWherever you want to start. We have all night.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, but it came out half like a sob.</p> <p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She turned so that she was facing away from him, but he didn\u2019t let go of her hand. \u201cMy sister, Olivia, and I. We\u2019re only two years apart. Growing up, she was my . . . my idol, my everything. I read books because she read them, I took ballet because she did, I played soccer because she did, though that one I was terrible at.\u201d He laughed. She looked up at him and laughed, too.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true. I was. I would pick flowers in the outfield during the game and make little flower crowns for myself.\u201d They smiled at each other, and then her smile dropped away. \u201cWhen I started high school, I was so excited to be back at the same school with Olivia. And, unlike my friends, I wasn\u2019t worried about starting high school, because I knew I had my sister there to watch out for me.\u201d</p><p>She got quiet. He waited for a moment, before he asked, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne weekend night after a few months of school had gone by, Olivia and her friends got in trouble. They all got high and then drunk, or drunk and then high, and broke into the high school and stole some stuff. Someone heard them and called the cops. They got caught as they were on their way out.\u201d</p><p>She splashed more wine into both of their glasses and took a long sip of her own before she continued.</p><p>\u201cAnd you have to understand, I was a good kid, a very never-get-in-trouble, obey-all-the-rules kind of kid. And I was so shocked that my sister, who I looked up to so much, who I thought was perfect, would do something like that. And then everyone found out, and I was so humiliated. I thought everyone would think badly about her now, and badly about our whole family. That my teachers would think less of me, that everyone would make fun of me.\u201d She glanced in his direction but didn\u2019t meet his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhy was it such a big deal?\u201d He set his wineglass down. \u201cThat sounds like typical teenage stuff. I did stuff like that when I was a teenager and never really got in big trouble, other than with my parents.\u201d</p><p>She raised her eyebrows and let go of his hand. He felt colder without her touching him.</p><p>\u201cI know, but Drew, you\u2019re a white guy. Life is different for you. You were born with a benefit of the doubt that black kids never get.\u201d</p><p>He put his hand on his knee.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true, but . . .\u201d He didn\u2019t really know how to finish that sentence.</p><p>She took another sip of wine and didn\u2019t look at him.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Drew. What would have happened if you\u2019d gotten drunk and broken into your high school? What did happen when you did stuff like this? Someone yelled at you and told your parents, you maybe got grounded and got your car taken away, but the school didn\u2019t do anything big. Possibly a suspension, but probably not, because you were a golden boy; you were one of the smart, charming ones who everyone loved and everyone could see would eventually make it to medical school. Because you were a white kid. So they got mad at you but always with that smile behind their eyes, to let you know they didn\u2019t really mean it and they actually thought it was a little funny, and boys will be boys. Even if someone called the cops on you, which they probably didn\u2019t, the cops wouldn\u2019t arrest you; they would just give you a lecture, and then maybe tell a story about the time they did something bad when they were a teen like you. Right?\u201d</p><p>That was frighteningly accurate. He flashed back to the time that Mrs. Mann had caught him and his buddy Toby stealing the principal\u2019s car for a prank, and had just winked at them and pretended she didn\u2019t see anything. They\u2019d gotten the car up to the roof of one of the outbuildings of the school, and the principal went ballistic, but no one ever told him who did it. Would Mrs. Mann have done the same thing if it had been Malik, who was in his AP Chemistry class, she\u2019d seen in the driver\u2019s seat instead? He wanted to think so, but too much in the world had told him otherwise. What would have happened to him?</p><p>He felt like he was tiptoeing through this conversation right now. He wanted to ask questions, he wanted her to keep talking, but he didn\u2019t want to say or do the wrong thing, and he had no idea what the right thing was. While he thought, he slid another slice of the now lukewarm pizza on her plate. She smiled her thanks but didn\u2019t pick it up. And she still didn\u2019t look at him.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he finally said. \u201cYou\u2019re right. That\u2019s exactly how it happened with me. I should have . . . I should have thought of that. What happened to your sister?\u201d</p><p>To his relief, she answered.</p><p>\u201cShe was arrested, along with all of her friends. It was . . . it was a pretty terrible night. I . . .\u201d She started to say something else and trailed off.</p><p>\u201cDid she have to go to jail?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cIn Oakland then, there was a pilot program sort of like TARP.\u201d Her voice went back to her chief of staff cadence. \u201cIt only lasted for a year, but it was just at the right time for Olivia, so instead of having to serve a sentence or have it on her record, she did the program. And since I know what a difference it made for her, I feel like it could . . . it would make a difference for teens in Berkeley today. Olivia got to achieve everything she wanted to, because people gave her a chance.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She still wasn\u2019t looking at him.

She stopped, closed her eyes, and swallowed before continuing. \u201cI was mean and snotty and insulting. I made her feel so bad for what happened. I did it on purpose! I became a tattletale to our parents for everything I thought she was doing wrong. We barely spoke for the better part of a year, and even after that, our relationship was fractious and difficult for years. We didn\u2019t really start becoming friends again until I was in college, and even then, it took years for us to be close.\u201d She paused, clearly lost in thought, and shook her head. \u201cI feel like . . . if I manage to make this happen, it would be my way of making up for everything.\u201d</p> <p>He moved across the couch and put his arm around her. She was so tense he wasn\u2019t sure how she\u2019d react to his touch. But she relaxed against him and released her knees.</p><p>\u201cAnd if you don\u2019t manage to make this happen? What then?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head as it rested against his shoulder. He turned toward her and kissed her hair. He felt her sigh.</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s me failing her again. If I can\u2019t do this one thing for my sister, for my family, for all of those other kids who need something like this like she did . . .\u201d</p><p>He pulled her closer to him, so happy to be with her. It felt wrong to be happy when she was on the point of tears, but he was honored that she was sharing this with him. This conversation felt like a gift.</p> <p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s not true, right? That if it doesn\u2019t pass this time it\u2019s not your fault? That all you can do is give everything you have to this, and you know you have been? You do know all that?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged and turned away from him. Okay. Did that mean she didn\u2019t want to talk about this anymore? He wasn\u2019t sure if he should keep talking, but he had one more question for her.</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to Olivia about this? Have you told her what you\u2019re trying to do, and why?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated and shook her head.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t . . . We don\u2019t really talk about that at all. At first, I was too ashamed to say anything, and now it seems like it\u2019s been too long.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond at first, not quite sure what to say. She reached for the slice of pizza he\u2019d put on her plate and had eaten half of it before he spoke again.</p> <p>\u201cSo, if TARP did pass, how were you going to tell her? You were going to tell her, right?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed, took a sip of her wine, and swallowed again.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019ve thought about that. I was going to email her a link to a news article about it. With something like, \u2018Look what your little sister has been up to?\u2019 or, \u2018Terrible name, great program, right?\u2019\u201d She sighed. \u201cOkay, maybe both of those ideas are stupid, but you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and squeezed her hand. The tense look on her face relaxed and she squeezed back.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should talk to her. Before the hearing, I mean. About TARP, yeah\u2014this is a great thing you\u2019re trying to do, and I know she\u2019d be proud. But also about the other stuff you told me. I\u2019m sure she would want to know.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head again but didn\u2019t let go of his hand.</p><p>\u201cIt was so hard for me to tell you, Drew. I don\u2019t even know how I would tell her how I felt, or what I would say.\u201d</p><p>He turned her so that her legs were draped over his and took her face in both his hands.</p> <p>\u201cSay to her what you said to me. Just think about it, okay? I think it would make you feel better.\u201d</p><p>She leaned her forehead against his and closed her eyes. He wrapped his arms around her, and they sat there for a while, breathing each other in.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d she said. He moved an inch closer to her, and their lips clung together slowly, gently. He wanted to deepen the kiss but pulled away.</p><p>\u201cNow, finish that slice of pizza so you don\u2019t have a hangover in the morning. Your doctor insists on it.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, as he\u2019d been hoping she would.</p><p>\u201cHow many children do you have to advise about hangovers, Dr. Nichols?\u201d</p><p>He stood up to take the pizza box and the empty wine bottle to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised. Though most of my patients have hangovers of the Halloween-candy variety.\u201d</p><p>Her laughter echoed through the house as he walked to the kitchen. He was so glad he\u2019d come.</p><p>When he came back from the kitchen, Alexa had dutifully eaten all of her pizza but the crust. He made fun of her for that, as he\u2019d done when she was in L.A.</p><p>\u201cYet another similarity you have with my patients.\u201d He grabbed her hands and pulled her to her feet. \u201cYou eat your pizza like a toddler.\u201d</p><p>She kept her hands in his and looked up at him. She felt wrung out emotionally, but she couldn\u2019t stop smiling at him. It was so nice to have him here, in her living room, just being here with her, on a Tuesday night. She could get used to this.</p><p>She shook that thought away.</p><p>\u201cDid you have any plans in mind for the rest of the night?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He pulled her close to him.</p><p>\u201cMmm, I don\u2019t know. What were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm.\u201d His lips trailed down her neck as she considered. \u201cWe could check out a show on Netflix? Or, ooh, I\u2019m listening to this great audiobook about segregation in American cities. We could listen together.\u201d He unzipped her hoodie and bit her shoulder. She gasped and giggled all at the same time. \u201cUnless you had another plan?\u201d</p><p>He straightened up, his eyes focused on her face as he ran his hands down her body. She closed her eyes against the sensation and moaned.</p><p>She opened her eyes to see him looking down at her. His shirt was half unbuttoned, his hair was on end, his eyes focused on her and only her. He looked like he\u2019d been sculpted from her wildest fantasies.</p><p>\u201cYou drive me crazy, Alexa. Did you know that?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and licked her suddenly dry lips.</p><p>Holy shit, how did this man still do this to her? Shouldn\u2019t this hunger for him and his body and his touch have worn off already? But no, it only seemed stronger now. He squeezed her nipple and she moaned again.</p><p>\u201cMy plan, you tease, was to spend the next few hours hearing you make that noise over and over again. What do you think about that plan, hmmm?\u201d He pulled her closer to him and kissed that spot on her neck that she loved. She sighed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no Netflix or audiobook, but it\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, and before she could blink, he\u2019d picked her up and thrown her over his shoulder. She pounded her hands on his back as he strode down the hall to her bedroom.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>He turned on the light in her bedroom and kicked a pair of shoes out of his way.</p><p>\u201cLess talk, Monroe.\u201d He dropped her on the bed. \u201cMore action.\u201d</p><p>How did the sex just keep getting better with her? Drew turned over onto his back, rolling her on top of him.</p><p>\u201cWas there an earthquake, or a bomb, or a building collapse or something?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cMmm, I don\u2019t think so. Why?\u201d She turned her head to look out the window.</p><p>\u201cBecause my ears are ringing.\u201d</p><p>He felt rather than heard her laugh. She laid her head on his chest and ran her hands up and down his still-tingling body. His hands went to her hair, and he held them there, just enjoying the sensation of being with her again.</p><p>\u201cWhen do you have to go back?\u201d she said against his chest.</p><p>Oh right. He had to go back.</p><p>\u201cMy flight\u2019s at seven in the morning.\u201d He pushed her hair over to the side so he could see her face. \u201cI\u2019m so glad I came.\u201d</p><p>She looked back at him and smiled, that wide smile that shone from every part of her face. He loved that smile.</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>Alexa got to work the next morning groggy but blissful. In the middle of the night she\u2019d woken up to him kissing the back of her neck and turned to give him access to the rest of her body. This time it was slower, gentler, quieter, but the fireworks had gone off just the same. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d refused to let her drive him to the airport that morning. He\u2019d insisted it was too early and she should get some of the sleep that he\u2019d robbed her of. She hadn\u2019t gotten any of that sleep\u2014she\u2019d jumped in the shower as soon as they\u2019d kissed good-bye at her front door\u2014but she\u2019d loved him for saying so.</p><p>She sank into her desk chair and barely managed to avoid spilling her coffee as that thought sank in.</p><p>Loved him? Wait, no, that\u2019s not what she\u2019d meant. She couldn\u2019t feel that way about him. That way was surely headed for heartbreak with a guy like Drew.</p><p>But he clearly cared about her, right? He jumped on a plane to come see her for less than twelve hours; he had to feel something for her. Or was she just trying to believe he felt something for her because, despite what she was trying to tell herself, she felt something for him?</p> <p>Damn it, this wasn\u2019t what was supposed to happen. This thing was supposed to be easy and fun and light. Maybe she could ignore these feelings and hope they went away?</p><p>Should she try to talk to Drew about how she felt? She shook her head. The only time she\u2019d tried to talk about their relationship to Drew it had been an unmitigated disaster. She didn\u2019t want to go through that again. Plus, she\u2019d almost certainly scared him away after all of that race talk the night before. White men hated it when you reminded them of their privilege, she knew that all too well.</p><p>But what was she supposed to do with all of these feelings now?</p><p>Bury them in a corner, drink her damn coffee, and stop having major life crises at eight a.m., that\u2019s what.</p><p>She managed to distract herself with work for most of the day, but by five thirty she gave up and called Maddie. She knew Maddie would tell her what to do.</p> <p>Drew walked into the hospital straight from the airport, thankful he\u2019d had an extra shirt in his gym bag so he didn\u2019t have to stop at home. Now that he was away from Alexa, he felt stupid about dropping everything to go see her, even though it had felt great in the moment. Good God, he was an adult, he\u2019d been a doctor for four years, and yet he got bad news about one of his patients and flew five hundred miles just to hug one woman?</p><p>He was getting in too deep. It was going to hurt way too much when it ended. It was going to hurt even more when she hated him. Like Molly had.</p><p>He never should have flown up there. The whole thing . . . it had been too much. Too intimate.</p><p>Part of him wanted to flee, never answer her text messages again, never see her again, forget he\u2019d ever known her.</p><p>But the thought of never seeing Alexa again made his stomach clench. He\u2019d only left her this morning, and he still couldn\u2019t wait to see her this weekend.</p><p>Of course the first person he saw when he stepped off the elevator was Carlos.</p> <p>\u201cHey, man, you look like shit,\u201d was Carlos\u2019s friendly greeting. He paused and his smile fell. \u201cOh wait. I heard about Jack. That sucks. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Drew shrugged. What was he supposed to say? That\u2019s okay? It wasn\u2019t, really, and Carlos knew that. So he said nothing.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you last night?\u201d Carlos followed him into his office. \u201cI called you, but your phone was off.\u201d</p><p>He thought about lying, but he knew Carlos would find out eventually. He was like that.</p><p>\u201cI went up to Berkeley.\u201d</p><p>Carlos stopped halfway into the chair. Damn it, he should have lied; he knew Carlos would make this into a bigger deal than it was.</p><p>\u201cOh? Hard day, you needed a hug from your girl?\u201d He settled into the chair and looked up at Drew with a smug expression. Drew was too tired and irritable for this.</p><p>\u201cWhatever, that wasn\u2019t it.\u201d He shrugged and smirked. \u201cI just needed some stress relief that I couldn\u2019t get from basketball. You know how it is.\u201d</p> <p>Carlos laughed, and for a minute, Drew thought Carlos would let it go.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how you\u2019re going to play it? It was just a booty call, right? Give me a break, you like this girl. You flew to the other end of the state to see her! Don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014she\u2019s great, and I approve completely, but . . .\u201d</p><p>Drew cut him off before he went too far.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I knew you\u2019d do this. Calm down. It was just an hour flight. I\u2019ve driven to the Valley to get laid before, same difference.\u201d</p><p>Carlos rolled his eyes. Why was he friends with this guy again?</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, no, you haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Okay, fine, he was right. Not that Drew was going to let him know that.</p><p>\u201cSecond, there\u2019s nothing wrong with going to hang out with your girl when you\u2019re upset. I\u2019m glad she was there for you, man.\u201d Carlos took a sip of his coffee.</p><p>Drew shook his head.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not how it was.\u201d That was exactly how it was. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you keep acting like this thing with Alexa is some big deal, anyway. It\u2019s probably not going to last all that much longer.\u201d</p><p>Carlos stared at him.</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t it? What did you do?\u201d</p><p>Drew resisted the urge to flip him off, but only because a nurse walked by his open door.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything! It\u2019s just . . . it\u2019s been going on for a while; we\u2019ve had a good run. Better to end things while they\u2019re still good.\u201d</p><p>Carlos\u2019s phone buzzed and he glanced at it, then back up at Drew.</p><p>\u201cNo offense, man, but don\u2019t be such a fucking idiot. I\u2019ve seen the way you look at this girl. I\u2019ve never seen you look at anyone or anything like you look at her. And you\u2019re just going to throw all of that away for some bullshit reason? Because you\u2019re too scared for something real?\u201d</p><p>Carlos checked his phone again and stood up.</p><p>\u201cI gotta go. But dude, stop being the idiot you always have been.\u201d</p><p>Maddie was borrowing her car for the weekend, so she drove Alexa to the airport on Friday night.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019re you feeling?\u201d Maddie asked.</p><p>Could she even describe how she felt about seeing Drew this weekend? Excited to see him, on edge about what the weekend could bring, relaxed at just the thought of being around him . . .</p><p>\u201cNervous.\u201d</p><p>She had to talk to him. She had to know what was going on and how he felt before it was too late. Though she was afraid that ship had sailed.</p><p>\u201cIt was a lot easier when I wasn\u2019t overthinking this.\u201d</p><p>Maddie turned to her at the stoplight.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t we both know that that could only last a weekend with you? Maybe a long weekend, maximum.\u201d</p><p>They both laughed.</p><p>\u201cDo you want a pep talk, or do you want to talk about something else?\u201d Maddie asked her.</p><p>She thought for a second. A pep talk would just hype her up too much.</p><p>\u201cSomething else, please. Tell me about what\u2019s-her-name, your crazy new client.\u201d</p><p>Maddie laughed.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, Alexa. Did I tell you what she wanted the other day? She needed cute exercise clothes, because she always runs into people she knows at the gym, right? But instead of Lululemon, she wanted exercise clothes that no one else has, so I had to dive into the world of $500 yoga pants and $200 sports bras, and let me tell you, that is a crazy world.\u201d</p><p>They gossiped the rest of the way to the airport, and Maddie hugged her when she got out of the car.</p><p>\u201cGood luck this weekend, Lex. Thanks for letting me use your car, and have a great trip.\u201d</p><p>She hugged Maddie back.</p><p>\u201cAnytime, Mads, you know that. And thanks.\u201d</p><p>Drew left straight from the hospital to pick Alexa up at the airport. Carlos high-fived him as he walked down the hall toward the elevator.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be at Heather\u2019s 4th of July party on Sunday, right?\u201d</p><p>Drew nodded as he got in the elevator.</p><p>\u201cSee you there.\u201d</p><p>Alexa walked out of the terminal just as he drove up, and he jumped out of the car to kiss her. Okay, maybe he was being hasty about ending things. Maybe Carlos was right. He\u2019d just been overtired and still upset about Jack on Wednesday morning. They could keep this going a little longer.</p><p>He squeezed her hand as he got on the freeway toward his house. Did she look tense? She looked tense. Should he ask why?</p><p>\u201cHungry?\u201d That was an easier question.</p><p>She shrugged off her cardigan. She was still in business mode, wearing one of those conservative dresses that he secretly loved. \u201cStarving. I barely had time for lunch, and I\u2019ve depleted all of my office snacks this week.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou want to go straight to dinner, then? That burger place again, maybe?\u201d</p><p>She turned toward him and grabbed his knee. Man, he loved it every time she touched him. Yeah, they could definitely keep this thing going for a while longer.</p><p>\u201cYes, and can we get that Tater Tot casserole this time? I can\u2019t promise to eat it all, but it looked amazing.\u201d</p><p>Apparently, many people had had the same idea for dinner that night. They stood together at the bar while they waited for a table, drinking beer and talking about everything and nothing.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t talk about Jack. He\u2019d already texted her that the test results had come back positive, and he didn\u2019t want to bring both of them down. She didn\u2019t bring up her program, and he didn\u2019t ask, although he was dying to know whether she was going to talk to her sister about it.</p><p>Instead, he told her about the kid who kept throwing things across the exam room and giggling, and how he had to step out in the hallway to laugh. She told him about the naked protestors who kept following the mayor around. As they laughed, the tense look on her face relaxed. Maybe it was the beer, but he hoped it was being with him.</p><p>Just as he was about to ask her if she wanted another beer, he heard his name. He turned and saw his friends Robin and Lucy walking toward him.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d He hugged them both, then turned to introduce Alexa to them.</p><p>\u201cHey guys, this is my . . . this is Alexa. Alexa, meet Lucy and Robin.\u201d He\u2019d almost slipped and called her his girlfriend. How the hell had that happened?</p> <p>No one had seemed to notice his flub, and Alexa was chatting away with Lucy, so he turned to Robin.</p><p>\u201cYou going to Heather\u2019s party on Sunday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you?\u201d</p><p>Just as he nodded, the hostess called his name, so they said their good-byes and followed her to the table.</p><p>This is my . . . What was he going to say? What was going to be the end of that sentence? Alexa guessed it didn\u2019t matter, because he hadn\u2019t finished it, so whatever he\u2019d been about to say, he hadn\u2019t really meant. Still, she spent the entire time they were at dinner with that sentence fragment running through her head.</p><p>Okay, maybe not the entire time. The rest of the time, she compared herself and the dowdy navy blue sheath dress she\u2019d worn to work that day to Lucy and Robin in their cute little sundresses. And her didn\u2019t-look-good-in-a-cute-little-sundress-anyway figure to their nonexistent hips and thighs. And the salads on their table to her Tater Tot casserole.</p> <p>Good God, she was a disaster. Why would she even think that he would finish that sentence the way she wanted him to?</p><p>\u201cMonroe, is everything okay? You look worried about something.\u201d Drew leaned over and smoothed out the furrow between her eyebrows with his thumb. She couldn\u2019t help but smile when he did that.</p><p>She almost asked him all of the questions in her head but decided against it. It wasn\u2019t the right time. She\u2019d been stressed all week; she needed to relax tonight.</p><p>Plus, what would happen if all of his answers were the wrong ones? She\u2019d spend the rest of the weekend miserable and pretending to smile?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I mean, I\u2019m fine. I was just trying to decide between another beer or a glass of wine.\u201d</p><p>They woke up the next morning wrapped around each other, the cool ocean breeze blowing in on them from his open window. She must have stirred, because his hand moved from her hip to her breast.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d he said against her ear. He caressed her body and she sighed in response.</p><p>\u201cMmm, she likes that. Weird, I thought I heard someone say she couldn\u2019t take it anymore just a few hours ago.\u201d</p> <p>She held his hand in place when he tried to move it.</p><p>\u201cIf you heard that, and I\u2019m not confirming that you did, whoever said that probably said \u2018until morning\u2019 at the end there but it was muffled somehow. In a pillow, maybe.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and kissed her ear, her cheek, her neck, as his fingers kept moving. Okay, he definitely enjoyed some things about her body, whether it was built for little sundresses or not.</p><p>\u201cCoffee?\u201d she said into the pillow a while later.</p><p>He turned her over and smiled down at her, his eyes roaming over her from her waist to the top of her head. She pulled his head down to hers and kissed him along his jawline.</p><p>\u201cHow about\u201d\u2014he turned his head and returned the kiss\u2014\u201cwhile I make coffee, you get ready so we can go to breakfast?\u201d</p><p>His hand was on her hip, his thumb drawing figure eights on her hip bone, and his eyes were locked on hers. Between all of that, she was powerless to say no to anything he asked.</p><p>After breakfast at Drew\u2019s favorite diner, they stumbled back into his apartment and collapsed on the couch.</p><p>\u201cGood Lord, why have you never taken me to that place before?\u201d Alexa asked him. \u201cI\u2019ve never had pancakes that good.\u201d</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d like the pancakes, even though the biscuits are my favorite.\u201d</p><p>He pulled out her ponytail so he could run his fingers through her hair, and she sighed and rested her head against his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cMonroe?\u201d</p><p>She turned and smiled at him, but she looked anxious again, like she had the night before.</p><p>Maybe she needed to get work done? Yeah, that was probably it. She always needed to get work done.</p><p>\u201cI was maybe going to go for a run. Did you . . . is that cool? You\u2019ll be okay here for a while, right?\u201d</p><p>She turned away from him and sat up.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s fine. I can get some work done while you\u2019re gone.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he\u2019d figured. He kissed her again as he stood up to go change into his running clothes. When he came back into the living room, her laptop was on her lap and she had that worried look on her face again. Still.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d</p><p>She jumped at the sound of his face and looked up.</p><p>\u201cOh . . . yeah, fine. Just checking my email.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t quite believe that. He wanted to sit down next to her and ask more questions, find out what was really upsetting her. Or was it that she would rather email with her buddy Theo than talk to him? But her eyes were back on her screen, not him. He\u2019d been dismissed.</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll be back in an hour or so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She didn\u2019t look up as he shut the door.</p><p>Had he wanted her to go running with him? And had he changed his mind once he looked at her? Did he want to say that they should both go running after eating all that food but decided that would hurt her feelings? Why had she been so filled with hope when he said \u201cMonroe?\u201d like that? What did she think he was going to say?</p><p>Was she going to drive herself insane asking herself questions like this all weekend? Signs point to yes.</p><p>She took a shower to clear her head, pulled on a tank top and yoga pants, and got back on the couch to check her email for real.</p><p>Forty-five minutes later, he burst through the front door, his face pink, his shirt sticking to his chest, and holy shit, she wanted to pull his clothes off immediately.</p><p>\u201cHow was your run?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He tugged his shirt off and wiped his face with it. Now she really couldn\u2019t stop staring at him.</p><p>\u201cYou changed.\u201d His chest was glistening, and his dark brown chest hairs stuck to his body. And those shorts . . . Did he have anything on under those shorts? She put her laptop on the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cMmmhmm, I took a shower.\u201d</p><p>He kicked his shoes into the corner of the room and took a step toward her.</p><p>\u201cIf you keep looking at me that way, I\u2019m going to pull you into the shower with me in about thirty seconds flat.\u201d</p><p>With him closer to her now, her head was just about even with his waist.</p><p>\u201cTen seconds.\u201d</p><p>She hooked her thumbs around his waistband and pulled his shorts down.</p><p>It took closer to fifteen seconds, but only because she stopped to throw off her clothes before he turned on the water. Thank goodness she\u2019d packed her blow-dryer.</p><p>\u201cSo who all is going to be at this party?\u201d Alexa asked him on Sunday as they ate a late breakfast on the couch. She\u2019d convinced him to make her pancakes this time. And not to toot his own horn, but they turned out pretty great.</p><p>\u201cA bunch of people you\u2019ve probably heard me talk about\u2014the guys from my basketball league; Carlos; Robin and Lucy, those girls you met last night; lots of other people I don\u2019t know.\u201d He paused. \u201cSome of the dudes from my basketball league who\u2019ll be there are black. FYI.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She smiled and squeezed his hand.</p><p>\u201cThanks for letting me know.\u201d She took another sip of coffee. \u201cWhose party is it again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeather\u2019s. She\u2019s an old friend of mine. She\u2019s got a great house, right on the beach.\u201d</p><p>He should probably mention that he\u2019d dated her, just so she wouldn\u2019t find out from someone else.</p> <p>\u201cUh, Heather and I used to sort of date, but that was a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She twisted a finger around a lock of her hair. \u201cOkay.\u201d She looked down at her half-eaten pancakes, so he couldn\u2019t see her face. \u201cWhat time should we go?\u201d</p><p>Did she not care that he\u2019d dated Heather? It\u2019s not like he wanted her to be all jealous about it. Okay, maybe just a little jealous would be nice.</p><p>\u201cI kind of wanted to go on the early side, since I\u2019m on call tonight. So, like, four or five?\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth, closed it, and drew her knees up against her chest.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe\u201d\u2014he wrapped his arms around her, knees included\u2014\u201cI can go for another run, and it can end like it did yesterday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmm.\u201d She turned her head back toward him, and he claimed her mouth. \u201cYou taste like syrup,\u201d she said, when they ended the kiss.</p><p>\u201cIf you like that, I have plenty more syrup, you know. There are many things we can do with it that don\u2019t involve pancakes.\u201d</p><p>She turned more fully around.</p><p>\u201cHmmm, that sounds interesting. Waffles, you mean? Do you have a waffle iron?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p> <p>\u201cBiscuits? My mom always puts syrup on biscuits.\u201d</p><p>He ran his hand down that deep V of his flannel robe that she loved to wear. And that he loved for her to wear.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d he said, his hand lingering at her left breast.</p><p>\u201cHmmm.\u201d She wiggled her shoulder, and the robe fell. \u201cThen I don\u2019t know. Tell me.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward to whisper in her ear as his hands roamed over her body.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have time for a run before the party.</p><p>Alexa realized after thirty seconds at Heather\u2019s party that she was out of her element. Maybe every woman at the party wasn\u2019t blond, but wow, did it sure look like it. And not just blond, but that perfect honey blond with golden highlights, all either up in swinging ponytails or down in flowing waves, in utter defiance of the humid air from the coast.</p><p>And it wasn\u2019t just the hair. They were all wearing those barely there dresses\u2014the kind that you couldn\u2019t wear a bra with, the kind that Alexa always walked right by in the store\u2014and their bodies looked perfect in them. She looked down at herself in the forgiving red and white polka-dot A-line dress she\u2019d felt cute in before leaving Drew\u2019s apartment and sighed.</p> <p>She saw at a glance she was the only black person there, but at least she knew more would show up eventually. She squeezed Drew\u2019s hand, grateful again to him for thinking to tell her that. He smiled down at her.</p><p>\u201cOh great, there\u2019s Heather,\u201d Drew said.</p><p>Oh great. His ex.</p><p>She had originally been glad he\u2019d told her that tidbit of information before they\u2019d arrived at the party. Way better than if she found out from another guest, or even worse, from Heather herself. But right now, as tall, thin, blond Heather turned to greet her, she wished she didn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cHeather, this is Alexa,\u201d Drew was saying. Alexa noticed that he didn\u2019t hesitate this time. She wasn\u2019t even \u201cmy . . .\u201d today, huh? \u201cAlexa, Heather. We brought beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrew, good to see you!\u201d Heather hugged first him, then Alexa. Given no choice in the matter, Alexa returned the hug. \u201cNice to meet you! Beer goes in the kitchen. Go outside and join the party. I\u2019ve got lots of beer and sangria, and the grills are all going.\u201d</p><p>They joined a group of people outside, Drew with a beer and Alexa with a glass of sangria. She almost coughed when she took a sip; there was a lot more alcohol in that sangria than she\u2019d been expecting. Drew introduced her to more people, and she tried to deal with this party the way she would at work: smile, make small talk, ask questions, get people talking about themselves. Like the way she\u2019d done at the wedding.</p><p>The thing was, right now she was too anxious to be professional Alexa. When she was at work events, she was confident. There, she knew who she was and what she was doing. The wedding had been a lark, with a guy she barely knew, where she was just playing a role. Here, none of those things were true. She felt uncertain. Off-kilter. She took another sip of sangria and plastered a smile on her face.</p><p>She fell back on the time-honored way to befriend strange women: compliments.</p><p>\u201cI love your sandals!\u201d she said to a woman named Emma. At least she was strawberry blond.</p><p>\u201cThanks!\u201d Emma said. Like lobbing a tennis ball back to Alexa, she returned the compliment. \u201cGreat lipstick! I always wish I could wear red lipstick, but with this hair, I feel like it always clashes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, I think there\u2019s a perfect red lipstick for everyone; it just takes trial and error. You need plenty of time at Sephora and a friend you trust.\u201d</p><p>They talked about makeup for a while longer. Either the conversation or the glass of sangria relaxed Alexa enough so that she stopped scanning the party for someone with brown skin or an errant eyebrow hair or even a tiny roll of fat.</p><p>She walked over to refill her glass of sangria. A guy Drew had just introduced her to followed her.</p><p>\u201cAlexa, right? Having fun so far?\u201d He put an arm around her. Lots of huggers at this party.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s great.\u201d She stepped to the side so she could pour her drink. \u201cMike, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, so smart of you to remember.\u201d Mike liked to stand close, didn\u2019t he? \u201cSo Alexa, where are you from?\u201d</p><p>She took a sip of her sangria and a half step backward.</p><p>\u201cBerkeley. I\u2019m just down here for the weekend.\u201d</p><p>Oh look, he\u2019d moved closer.</p><p>\u201cYou live in Berkeley? That\u2019s cool. But I meant, like, where are you really from?\u201d</p><p>Now she knew where this was going. Like she couldn\u2019t \u201creally\u201d be from California? Why did people always try to ask her about her ethnicity in the clumsiest of all possible ways? Getting this question, especially in this way, always made her feel like such an object of curiosity. Today it made her feel like even more of an Other in this party full of golden-haired beauty queens.</p><p>Now she was doubly annoyed with Mr. Stands Too Close. So she was going to fuck with him.</p><p>\u201cOh, not that far from there. I grew up in Oakland. Northern California girl!\u201d She gave him her biggest, fakest grin.</p><p>He chuckled and took another swig of his beer.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, like where are you from from? Where are your parents from?\u201d</p><p>This conversation was so predictable. Yet this dance people did was irritating every time.</p><p>\u201cMy parents are from California, too. My dad grew up here in L.A., actually, and my mom up in the Bay Area. What about yours?\u201d</p><p>She felt a hand land on the small of her back and relaxed. She turned and saw Drew there next to her, as she knew he would be.</p><p>\u201cIs Mike monopolizing you?\u201d He grinned at Mike and did that hand slap thing guys did instead of hugging. \u201cHow\u2019s it going, man?\u201d</p><p>Mike\u2019s eyes flashed to Drew\u2019s arm disappearing around her back, and he took a step backward.</p><p>\u201cGood, good, just stopped to chat here with your friend Alisha.\u201d</p><p>She gritted her teeth, not even caring anymore if it looked like a smile.</p><p>\u201cAlexa.\u201d</p><p>Mike laughed and lifted his glass of sangria to hers.</p><p>\u201cRight, right, Alexa, of course. Nice to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>She walked with Drew toward the grills. As soon as they were out of earshot, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t like that guy.\u201d</p><p>He stopped walking and turned to her.</p><p>\u201cWhy, what did he do?\u201d</p><p>She made a face.</p><p>\u201cRemember that Bill guy from the wedding? Creepy and borderline offensive?\u201d</p><p>Now he stopped walking.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t borderline. Mike\u2019s like that guy? Damn it, I\u2019m sorry. I should have come to find you earlier.\u201d</p><p>He believed her. Just like that. So often, guys would jump in to defend other men when women said they\u2019d crossed a line. It had happened to her over and over again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But Drew had immediately believed her. Why did a little thing like that touch her so much? She reached for his hand.</p><p>\u201cNo, it was okay, I handled it. Just . . . come over if you see him cornering me again?\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her hand and smiled.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. Here, let\u2019s go talk to some better people.\u201d</p> <p>He introduced her to his friend Luke, another doctor at his hospital, and Luke\u2019s husband, Brendan, one of the aforementioned dudes from his basketball league.</p><p>\u201cAhh, you\u2019re the reason for Drew\u2019s mysterious trips up to the Bay Area as of late,\u201d Luke said. \u201cSo nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Did . . . Was Drew blushing? It could just be sunburn, but she hadn\u2019t noticed his cheeks that color pink five minutes ago.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, too, Luke, Brendan.\u201d</p><p>Brendan gestured at her drink.</p> <p>\u201cIs that the sangria? How is it?\u201d</p><p>She took another sip and realized she was almost halfway through this glass.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s great, but be forewarned, it has more of a kick to it than I expected. If Drew has to carry me out of here in a few hours, it\u2019s because I had more than two glasses of this stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-oh,\u201d Drew said. \u201cShould I go get us some food to soak up all of that alcohol? There are burgers, hot dogs, sausages . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely a hot dog,\u201d Alexa said. \u201cIt\u2019s the 4th of July. It\u2019s un-American not to have a hot dog!\u201d</p><p>Luke\u2019s eyebrows went up and he opened his mouth. Brendan kicked him and he closed it.</p> <p>\u201cI saw that,\u201d Alexa said, and all four of them laughed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know you quite well enough for a sausage joke yet, so pretend you didn\u2019t see that.\u201d Luke paused. \u201cI can tell it after you\u2019ve had that third sangria.\u201d</p><p>Drew groaned.</p><p>\u201cOh no, I\u2019m scared to leave you with these two now. God only knows what they\u2019re going to do or say.\u201d</p><p>Alexa waved Drew away.</p><p>\u201cGo on, get me my hot dog, I can\u2019t wait to see the looks on their faces as I eat it and they have to hold their jokes in. Maybe for dessert there will be popsicles?\u201d</p><p>After all four of them ate hot dogs\u2014with most of the jokes at Drew\u2019s expense\u2014Alexa excused herself to both refresh her sangria and go to the bathroom. Coming out of the bathroom, she ran into Heather and Emma, along with Lucy and Robin from the night before.</p><p>\u201cHey, Alexa!\u201d Heather said. \u201cHaving fun? I was just taking this crew to the kitchen for some of the white sangria, I haven\u2019t put it out yet. Do you want to try it?\u201d</p> <p>Never one to say no to an offer like that, Alexa followed the other women into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cSo Alexa,\u201d Heather said as she poured the sangria, \u201cdo you live here in Santa Monica?\u201d</p><p>Alexa glanced around the room to see if the others were all looking at her. Not yet, at least. How long ago had Heather and Drew dated? She wondered if the ranks were going to close against her like with Molly\u2019s bridesmaids at the wedding.</p><p>\u201cNo, just here for the weekend. I live up in Berkeley, actually.\u201d</p><p>Lucy\u2019s eyes shot to her face. What had she said?</p><p>\u201cAre you from there? What do you do up there?\u201d Lucy took a sip of her own sangria without her eyes leaving Alexa\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I mean, yeah, I\u2019m from the Bay Area. I work for the mayor of Berkeley.\u201d</p><p>The other three women burst out laughing. She looked around at the four of them with raised eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I say?\u201d Was this going to be like junior high, where people would corner you and laugh in your face?</p><p>Robin took a sip of her sangria and grinned.</p><p>\u201cOh, we\u2019re just laughing because we know Lucy isn\u2019t going to leave your side for the rest of the night.\u201d</p><p>Lucy rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, they\u2019re making fun of me, not you. See, I keep talking about quitting my job as a teacher and going to law school, and the law school at Berkeley is supposed to be great for the kind of law I want to do. But just because you work for the mayor and live there doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re an expert on the law school . . . does it?\u201d</p><p>Alexa held her glass out to Heather for a refill.</p><p>\u201cMaybe not an expert, but I did graduate from Berkeley Law School, so . . .\u201d</p><p>Lucy crossed the room so fast she almost knocked into Heather.</p><p>\u201cTell me everything.\u201d</p><p>After Alexa went inside, Drew got his share of teasing from Luke and Brendan.</p><p>\u201cGood God, you should see the way you look at her,\u201d Luke said. \u201cIt\u2019s like me when I\u2019m looking at . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cA really fat sausage?\u201d Brendan suggested.</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up, both of you,\u201d Drew said, after Luke and Brendan recovered from their peals of laughter.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, but it\u2019s cute,\u201d Brendan said. \u201cLook at you\u2014you keep glancing toward the house to see if she\u2019s coming back and trying to pretend that you\u2019re just looking at your drink.\u201d</p><p>Drew shifted his eyes back in their direction. Okay, fine, they caught him looking for her. He was just trying to make sure she made it back outside okay. No, that excuse didn\u2019t even work in his own head.</p><p>Eventually, Kat, another doctor at the hospital, came over to them.</p><p>\u201cHey, Drew,\u201d she said. \u201cDid I see you running on the beach yesterday? I shouted to you, but if it was you, you didn\u2019t answer.\u201d Kat lived not far from him, and they went running together sometimes.</p><p>\u201cAround noon? Yeah, that was me. I guess I was preoccupied. Sorry I didn\u2019t say hi.\u201d He glanced toward the house again.</p><p>\u201cHuh, what could you have been preoccupied with this weekend?\u201d Brendan said, between bites of hot dog. \u201cOr should I say, who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two are such assholes,\u201d Drew said. He didn\u2019t know if they heard him through their laughter.</p><p>\u201cEnough law school talk,\u201d Heather ordered. By this time, they were all sitting around the kitchen table. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about something more interesting. Alexa, how did you meet Drew?\u201d</p><p>Hmm, which story was she supposed to tell? They hadn\u2019t really discussed that.</p><p>\u201cWe met at a wedding.\u201d She took another sip. Oh well, if Drew didn\u2019t want her to tell the truth, he should have told her their cover story before she\u2019d had all of this sangria. \u201cSort of. In the elevator a few days before his ex-girlfriend\u2019s wedding, actually. He needed a date, and I was free that night, so . . .\u201d</p><p>The whole table cracked up, Alexa included.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s such a Drew story,\u201d Robin said. \u201cMeets a girl in an elevator, convinces her to go with him to a wedding that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that night. It was . . .\u201d</p><p>Emma broke in.</p><p>\u201cWas this that wedding in May? Oh man, I was supposed to go with him to that wedding, but my dad had surgery so I couldn\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>Wait, this was that Emma? Had everyone at this table dated Drew?</p><p>\u201cHas everyone at this table dated Drew?\u201d Shit, she probably shouldn\u2019t have said that out loud. But at least now she\u2019d get an answer.</p><p>\u201cNot me!\u201d Lucy said. But Heather, Emma, and Robin all rose their hands. Huh.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a sweetheart,\u201d Robin said. \u201cWe had a great time while it lasted.\u201d</p><p>Everyone else at the table nodded.</p><p>\u201cHow long did . . . Why did it end?\u201d Alexa asked them. What was she supposed to do, not ask these women who had all dated Drew that, when she was both tipsy and had been thinking about that very topic for days? She did not have that much willpower.</p><p>Heather was the one who answered her.</p><p>\u201cAt least for me, it was when it was going really well. I was starting to think . . . well, whatever, I\u2019ve been over it for a while. But after about two months, he came over one night and gave me a little speech about how it was best to end things when we\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere still friends?\u201d Emma jumped in. \u201cYeah, I got that same speech. He was really sweet about it, though. Even sent me flowers afterward, to make sure there were no hard feelings.\u201d</p><p>Robin laughed.</p><p>\u201cI got the same speech, also after about two months, but no flowers. The flowers must be new.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Heather jumped in.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a testament to what a great guy Drew is that we all still like him. And one another. He obviously only dates great women.\u201d She stood up and refilled everyone\u2019s sangria cups.</p><p>\u201cSo what did you put in that sangria anyway?\u201d she asked. The subject changed to cocktail recipes. Alexa did her best to chime in with her favorites as her mind was swirling.</p><p>Maybe she didn\u2019t want to get those answers from Drew after all.</p> <p>Drew almost went into the house to find Alexa at least three times and stopped himself each time. Finally, he saw her walking across the lawn with Lucy and Robin.</p><p>He and Kat wandered over to them. When he put his hand on the small of her back, she jumped.</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s just me.\u201d She\u2019d probably been on edge from Mike irritating her earlier. \u201cYou having fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She took a step away from him and looked at the group around them. \u201cIt\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>She reached her hand out to Kat, that smile from the wedding on her face again.</p> <p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Alexa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Drew jumped in. \u201cKat, this is Alexa. She\u2019s here visiting this weekend. Alexa, this is Kat. She\u2019s also a doctor, and a sometime running buddy of mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. So nice to meet you, Kat!\u201d Alexa took another sip of her drink and turned back to Lucy and Robin.</p><p>Was something wrong? It felt like something was wrong.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you ladies up to inside for so long?\u201d Brendan asked as he came up to the group.</p><p>Robin, Lucy, and Alexa all laughed. Alexa was looking at them, not at him. Why wasn\u2019t she sharing this laughter with him?</p> <p>\u201cOh, just chatting,\u201d Lucy said. \u201cWell, drinking and chatting, anyway.\u201d She turned to Alexa. \u201cOh God, Alexa, I forgot to tell you that story about how two of my students got arrested\u2014it tested every instinct I had when they told me about it, because I wanted to laugh so hard but I knew I shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>As Lucy went on to tell a long story about her students and a cemetery and getting chased by security guards into blackberry bushes, Drew watched Alexa. She was totally relaxed with the other women, smiling and laughing without that fake smile that he hated on her face. That smile had been his sign to come over when she was talking to Mike.</p><p>But she still had that tense look around her eyes. When he touched her arm, she turned toward him, but her body was stiff.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d he said in a low voice.</p><p>She flashed a smile, but it didn\u2019t reassure him. It didn\u2019t have that glitter of joy hovering behind her eyes like her real smiles usually did.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said. \u201cWant to get me more sangria?\u201d</p><p>When he came back with the sangria, he brought a plate of chips and guacamole for them to share. This time when he joined the group he slid an arm around her waist, but she stepped away from him.</p><p>\u201cOh look, Heather\u2019s bringing out the cupcakes. Let me go see if she needs help.\u201d</p> <p>So she walked off to help Heather with the cupcakes, leaving him with one arm empty, and one hand weighed down with a full plate of chips.</p><p>\u201cThose for me?\u201d Carlos asked from behind him.</p><p>\u201cHey, man, when\u2019d you get here?\u201d</p><p>Carlos reached for a handful of his chips.</p><p>\u201cJust now. Why are you looking so forlorn? Where\u2019s Alexa?\u201d</p><p>He gestured with his empty hand.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s over there, asshole. Helping Heather do something with cupcakes . . .\u201d He paused as he saw Alexa and Heather talking to three men he didn\u2019t know. \u201cI guess Heather introduced her to some more people.\u201d</p><p>Carlos looked at him for a long moment but just nodded.</p><p>\u201cCool, I\u2019ll go say hi. Where are the drinks?\u201d</p><p>Drew pointed and went back to munching on chips and listening to Lucy and Brendan talk about surfing. Forlorn? He wasn\u2019t forlorn. It was possible he would prefer Alexa to be standing next to him than over on the other side of the party talking to three strange men, but he wasn\u2019t forlorn.</p><p>He watched Carlos approach her group and tap her on the shoulder. Alexa threw her arms around Carlos and beamed her hundred-watt smile at him and absorbed him in her cozy little group. Drew waited for her to look around for him. She was probably just waiting to catch his eye to signal to him to come join them. But she didn\u2019t turn her head.</p><p>Alexa was glad she hadn\u2019t tried to have the Talk with Drew before coming to the party. She would have made some humiliating speech about how she felt about him and how she wanted a relationship with him, and he would have looked at her with pity in his eyes.</p><p>She\u2019d always known what the deal was. That was the worst part. She\u2019d known from the beginning who and what he was\u2014he\u2019d told her so. What did she think, someone like her was going to change him?</p><p>She kept trying to snap out of it, to give herself a mental pep talk. But every time she caught a glimpse of Drew standing next to Kat, his hot blond \u201crunning buddy,\u201d she needed more sangria to wash down the bitter taste of shame.</p><p>Thank God at least no one knew. She hadn\u2019t told Drew how she felt, and she was almost certain she\u2019d managed to keep her face relaxed and jokey in the kitchen with the other women. She wouldn\u2019t be able to handle their sympathy on top of the sadness that she knew was hovering in the back of her eyes.</p><p>It would be so much easier if she could be mad at Drew. But Drew had done nothing wrong. He\u2019d been perfectly honest with her the whole time. It was her own fault for making up stories in her head about what it meant that he looked at her this way or touched her that way or had that tone in his voice when he talked to her.</p><p>Twenty-four hours until her plane left LAX. She could keep pushing that sadness in its little box for twenty-four hours until she\u2019d be able to let it out.</p><p>She kept unconsciously looking around the party for a friendly face. Someone familiar, who she could relax around, not be so on with, just be herself. Someone who she didn\u2019t have to smile and fake it with. But the only person like that was Drew, and looking at him hurt now.</p><p>After another glass of sangria, she felt a hand on her shoulder and turned.</p><p>\u201cCarlos!\u201d Finally, someone she\u2019d known more than an hour. \u201cI was hoping you were going to be here. How\u2019ve you been?\u201d She hugged him, not sure if the tears that shot to her eyes during the hug were because she was glad to see him, or because of the sangria. Probably a little of both. At least she\u2019d get to say good-bye to Carlos. He\u2019d been so nice to her.</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d He toasted her plastic cup with his bottle of beer, his arm slung around her shoulder. \u201cI knew you\u2019d be here, Drew\u2019s found ways to mention you all week.\u201d</p><p>She looked down at her cup. Sure he had.</p><p>Drew came over to join their group, but this time she saw him coming, so she could dodge his touch without being obvious about it. She couldn\u2019t handle that warm, firm touch on her back or around her waist right now. She\u2019d taken such comfort in it, thought it meant so much.</p><p>But it had turned out to mean nothing at all. Instead of soothing her, now it made her angry. Mostly at herself.</p><p>She left Drew and Carlos behind and walked with Lucy to get more of the white sangria. Intellectually, she knew that she should probably stop drinking so much, but following Lucy was a good way to escape. As was the sangria itself.</p><p>Was it his imagination that Alexa was avoiding him? Probably. It was probably his imagination. But the thing was, for the past hour, she\u2019d walked around with Heather and Emma, and Robin and Lucy, and chatted with a whole group of guys he\u2019d never met. Every time he walked up to her, she\u2019d moved when he\u2019d touched her and had some reason to walk away after a minute or so.</p><p>He left her alone for a while and talked to other people, but he was always aware of where she was and who she was talking to. He told himself it was just so he could rescue her from Mike if necessary. Even in his head he knew that wasn\u2019t true.</p><p>Finally, he saw her standing alone over by the drinks table and walked toward her, determined to figure out what was wrong. Before he could get there, Carlos came up to her, threw an arm around her, and said something in her ear that made her laugh so hard he could hear it from across the backyard. When he reached the two of them, they were both still giggling. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey guys, having fun over here?\u201d He reached for Alexa\u2019s hand, but she switched her drink from her left to right. She\u2019d looked in his direction but turned back to Carlos, the smile still on her face but no longer in her eyes.</p><p>Carlos grinned at him, but was that guilt in his face? What was Carlos whispering to his girlfriend about, anyway?</p><p>\u201cYeah, we were just talking . . . about the party,\u201d Carlos said, flashing his eyes back toward Alexa. They shared a grin that made Drew feel like a third wheel.</p><p>\u201cYou two are looking kind of cozy. What are you, planning your escape so you can be alone together?\u201d Drew joked. Except somehow it didn\u2019t really come out like a joke.</p> <p>Alexa looked straight at him for what felt like the first time that afternoon.</p><p>\u201cWas that some kind of accusation? Because it felt like it.\u201d</p><p>Carlos\u2019s arm dropped from around Alexa\u2019s shoulders. Drew felt a flash of anger that it had been there in the first place, especially when she hadn\u2019t wanted him to touch her all day.</p><p>\u201cLooks like I struck a nerve.\u201d Why did he even say that? He didn\u2019t really believe something was going on with Carlos and Alexa . . . did he?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Drew,\u201d Alexa shot back. \u201cYou planning your escape from me so you can figure out which of the women here will be your new \u2018friend\u2019? I can go home now so you don\u2019t have an inconvenient sandwich at this buffet.\u201d</p> <p>Okay, something was definitely wrong.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is that supposed to mean?\u201d Drew said.</p><p>Alexa\u2019s lips curved into what some people might think was a smile.</p><p>\u201cPretty much exactly what I said.\u201d She took the last sip of her drink and put it down. \u201cWait, you probably don\u2019t remember\u2014in this instance, the sandwich and the buffet are a metaphor for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what it\u2019s a fucking metaphor for, Alexa. I remember. What\u2019s your problem today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck with this,\u201d Carlos muttered from behind him as he backed away.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s my problem today?\u201d Alexa wasn\u2019t even pretending to smile anymore. \u201cMy problem is that I\u2019m tired of meeting all of your perfectly nice friends who are checking my forehead for my Drew Nichols expiration date. It was cute at the wedding, but it\u2019s not fun or funny for me anymore, especially since I have a strong feeling that my expiration date is July 5th.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her hand hard enough that she couldn\u2019t pull away and marched her into Heather\u2019s house and up the stairs. He closed the door once they got inside Heather\u2019s bedroom.</p><p>\u201cOkay, now can we please talk about this without an audience?\u201d The walk up the stairs had calmed him down. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here? I was just kidding about the Carlos thing. I shouldn\u2019t have said that.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. Her laugh didn\u2019t sound like Alexa\u2019s laugh.</p><p>\u201cWhat would it matter to you anyway if I was fucking Carlos? Like you would care.\u201d</p><p>Whoa, where had that come from?</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck, Alexa? You know that\u2019s not true. Come on, what happened? What changed between now and this morning?\u201d He took a step toward her and she backed away.</p><p>\u201cNothing you need to worry about, Drew. Go back outside, hang out with your friend Kat. I can occupy myself.\u201d</p> <p>His shoulders relaxed. She was jealous! He could fix this; it was going to be okay.</p><p>\u201cIs that what this is about? Monroe, nothing is going on between me and Kat\u2014we\u2019re just friends.\u201d Something suddenly occurred to him. \u201cI should have told you\u2014I used to date Robin . . . and Emma. Did they tell you that? Were they weird to you? Is that why you\u2019re mad?\u201d</p><p>Alexa threw up her hands.</p><p>\u201cNo, Drew, everyone here is great. The women are nice and collegial, all welcoming me to the club of people who have had their month or so of sleeping with the great Drew Nichols, with that slight pity in their eyes when they look at me because they know what\u2019s coming. The men all look me up and down like they\u2019re ready to jump me as soon as you\u2019re done with me, because they assume there must be something good in there if I\u2019m worthy of you. Same as it\u2019s ever been since the wedding, honestly.\u201d</p><p>He still didn\u2019t understand what was wrong. Maybe he was never going to understand women.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you keep bringing up the wedding? I thought everything was fine at the wedding. Better than fine.\u201d</p><p>She took a step toward him. Finally, she wasn\u2019t backing away anymore.</p><p>\u201cEverything was fine at the wedding because the wedding wasn\u2019t real! I\u2019d met you two days before, I didn\u2019t know you, I didn\u2019t know anything about you, and I didn\u2019t care about you then.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and reached for her.</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean you care about me now?\u201d</p><p>She dodged his hand and stepped around him toward the bedroom door.</p><p>\u201cFuck you, Drew.\u201d</p><p>Apparently, that had been the wrong thing to say.</p><p>\u201cNo, wait, Alexa. I didn\u2019t . . . I don\u2019t understand. Please don\u2019t leave.\u201d He needed to fix this. He didn\u2019t want her to be mad. He didn\u2019t want this to be over.</p><p>Her hand dropped from the doorknob, but her back was still to him. He had to say something to get her to turn around. Maybe honesty would work.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean the wedding wasn\u2019t real? It felt real to me.\u201d It had. From the moment he\u2019d first touched her, it had felt like she\u2019d belonged there by his side, smiling at him, joking with him, confiding in him, listening to him, being silent with him. Everything about this had felt real from the beginning, even when he barely knew her.</p><p>Now that he really knew her, and she knew him, it felt more than real. It felt like his life finally made sense.</p><p>He\u2019d tried to pretend to himself all week that he would end things with her after this weekend, but he\u2019d known as soon as he saw her at the airport that that wasn\u2019t true. Not only that he wouldn\u2019t, but he couldn\u2019t.</p><p>She turned around, and for a minute he felt like he\u2019d said the right thing. That was, until he saw the look on her face.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s how I know the wedding wasn\u2019t real, Drew. Because at the wedding, you called me your girlfriend. In real life, I\u2019m nothing to you.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. She was so far from nothing.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is true! Since the wedding, I\u2019ve been just Alexa, or sometimes \u2018my friend Alexa,\u2019 or occasionally dramatic pause Alexa. But never your girlfriend, because in real life, Drew Nichols doesn\u2019t do girlfriends. Which is fine\u2014that\u2019s fine, at least you\u2019re honest\u2014but don\u2019t try to pretend that I\u2019m making this up right now.\u201d</p><p>Oh, thank God, she could finally legitimately be mad at Drew. She\u2019d felt guilty being mad at him earlier; it hadn\u2019t been his fault that she had feelings for him, or that she\u2019d wanted him to return those feelings so much she\u2019d almost convinced herself that he did.</p><p>But it was his fault that he was now trying to act like he\u2019d wanted her with him at the wedding for anything more than a shield. And it sure as hell was his fault he sounded so smug she\u2019d admitted she cared about him.</p><p>He rubbed his eyes and ran his fingers through his hair. Even after all of this, she had to fight to not reach up and touch it.</p><p>\u201cAlexa, can we talk about this, please?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. The patented Drew breakup talk was the last thing she wanted right now.</p><p>\u201cNo need for a conversation. I know the drill.\u201d</p><p>He stepped closer to her. She was annoyed that even in the midst of this fight they were never going to come back from, she just wanted to step into his arms and have him tell her everything was going to be okay.</p><p>\u201cCome on, can you calm down for a minute and let me say something?\u201d</p><p>That solved that problem. Nothing pissed her off more than a man telling her to calm down.</p><p>\u201cI get it, my feelings aren\u2019t worth anything to you, but I can be as un-calm as I want about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, that\u2019s not what I meant. I just want to . . .\u201d He paused and put his hand on her arm. \u201cI just want to explain.\u201d</p><p>At his touch, tears shot to her eyes. She shook his arm off and turned away from him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Drew. You don\u2019t need to explain. Your feelings come through loud and clear.\u201d She opened the door and ran back downstairs before he could reach for her again.</p><p>Thank God no one was in the bathroom. She ducked in there for a few minutes to take a deep breath and swallow the tears that had threatened. She washed her hands, dabbed cold water under her eyes, and faked a smile at herself in the mirror like she hadn\u2019t just had a sangria-fueled relationship-ending fight in the middle of a party.</p><p>When she walked out of the bathroom, she ran into Heather, coming out of the kitchen with more cupcakes.</p><p>\u201cAwesome, you can help me carry these.\u201d Heather handed her a tray of cupcakes. Thankful for something to do, Alexa carried them outside. She took a deep breath before she walked through the door, but a quick scan of the crowd showed her no evidence of either Drew or Carlos in the yard. She did see Lucy, though, and put two red velvet cupcakes on a plate for the two of them.</p> <p>\u201cYou said this was your favorite, right?\u201d Alexa held out the plate to Lucy, and soon they both had red tongues and lips smeared in cream cheese frosting. Robin joined them with a cupcake of her own and a pile of napkins. Alexa had just relaxed a little and wiped her mouth when the circle opened and she heard Drew\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cAlexa.\u201d His voice was steady, like their fight had made no impact on him. \u201cI got a call. I\u2019ve got to be at the hospital in thirty minutes.\u201d He touched his hand to her shoulder and dropped it almost as quickly. \u201cSorry to do this to you guys, but I have to take Alexa away from you: duty calls.\u201d</p><p>She thought about telling him that she\u2019d stay, that she could get a ride home later, and also that he could go fuck himself.</p><p>But her political training hadn\u2019t completely deserted her; not even this much sangria would allow her to let all of these people know her business. So instead, she gave everyone in the group hugs good-bye amid false promises of getting drinks \u201cthe next time she was in town\u201d and followed Drew to his car.</p><p>Drew had stayed in Heather\u2019s bedroom for a while after Alexa had fled. He\u2019d wanted to run after her, to tell her no, she\u2019d gotten it all wrong, that wasn\u2019t how he felt. But he\u2019d already made a mess of this conversation, so he figured he should maybe wait and try again when they got home after the party and could really talk.</p> <p>But then he got the call from the hospital and had to run outside and grab her in a hurry. He\u2019d thought about asking Carlos to drive her home, but after basically accusing Carlos of hitting on her, he wasn\u2019t in the best position to ask Carlos for a favor. Plus, he didn\u2019t want Alexa to think he was pissed at her and had ditched her at the party.</p><p>However, from the look on her face and the way she refused to meet his eyes when he found her outside, he thought for a second that she\u2019d tell him to go on without her. That would have pissed him off. That he could tell she\u2019d considered it even pissed him off.</p><p>They drove without talking for a few minutes, the only noise in the car the pop music she\u2019d been singing along to on the way there. She broke the silence before he could.</p><p>\u201cDid you really get a call from the hospital, or was that just your excuse to leave?\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when he lost his temper.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck, Alexa? Really? You really think I would make up a call from the hospital just to get you out of there? Do you think I\u2019m that much of a child?\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t respond, and when he glanced her way, she just shrugged. That made his temper flare even higher.</p><p>\u201cReally? You have that low of an opinion of me, just because I didn\u2019t introduce you to people as my girlfriend? Just because I don\u2019t use the exact word that you want me to use to describe you, you decide I\u2019m the kind of asshole who would lie to you and all of my friends like that? When you decided to push back our dinner reservations by an hour last night because you were on the phone with your buddy Teddy writing one fucking sentence together for forty-five minutes, did I call you a controlling bitch workaholic who doesn\u2019t pay attention to anyone else\u2019s feelings? No, I didn\u2019t, but I sure as hell could have.\u201d</p><p>He thought he saw her flinch out of the corner of his eye, but when he turned to look at her, her face was impassive.</p><p>\u201cAt least I finally know what you really think of me.\u201d</p><p>He turned into his parking spot, his sudden anger gone as quickly as it had come.</p><p>\u201cNo, Alexa, I didn\u2019t . . .\u201d She was out of the car before he could say anything else. He followed her up to his apartment, unlocked the door, and pushed it open for her before following her inside.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said that. I didn\u2019t mean it\u2014that\u2019s not how I feel,\u201d he said as soon as he\u2019d shut the door. Her back was still to him as she walked around the living room picking up her stuff.</p><p>\u201cAlexa! Come on, talk to me.\u201d She finally turned to him. He looked at the pile of her stuff in her hands. \u201cWait a minute, what are you doing?\u201d</p> <p>She neatly piled it all into the big purse she always used on the airplane.</p><p>\u201cWhat does it look like I\u2019m doing? Why are you still here? Don\u2019t you have to go to the hospital?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head in reaction to what she\u2019d said. In reaction to everything.</p><p>\u201cNo! I mean, yes, I have to go to the hospital, but no, please don\u2019t pack. Don\u2019t leave now! You can\u2019t leave now. I have to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>She stood there, silently, staring somewhere around the base of his neck but not meeting his eyes. He closed the distance between them and held on to her shoulders. She finally looked up at him but still didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cPromise me. Promise you won\u2019t leave. If this . . . if this has meant anything to you at all, promise me you won\u2019t leave while I\u2019m at the hospital.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and dropped her head, but he didn\u2019t let go of her. Finally, she whispered, \u201cOkay. I promise.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her into his arms. She leaned her head against his shoulder for a quick second before she stepped backward.</p><p>\u201cGo. You\u2019re going to be late.\u201d</p><p>She was right. He looked back over his shoulder at her on his way out the door, but she had already turned to look out the window.</p><p>Alexa dropped into a chair and put her head in her hands as soon as he walked out the door. What a fucking nightmare the past few hours had been. She\u2019d planned the whole way home in the car to pack and take a cab to the airport as soon as he left for the hospital, but now she couldn\u2019t even do that.</p><p>She was usually the last person who would leave in the middle of a fight. She liked to finish any discussion, she liked closure, and she always wanted to know exactly where she stood.</p><p>But this time she couldn\u2019t wait to get out of there. She already knew where she stood; she didn\u2019t need him to say it out loud. She didn\u2019t want to finish this fight, didn\u2019t want him to tell her what she knew was coming, didn\u2019t want to have to deal with the pain of listening to the gentle breakup speech he\u2019d perfected on the dozen women who came before her.</p><p>What would be even worse was if he didn\u2019t give her the breakup speech today. If instead he found some way to convince her to stay with him. That would just postpone the inevitable and make it hurt all the more when he finally decided to move on. And make her feel even more stupid when he did.</p><p>That\u2019s why she had to get out of there. Fly back to Berkeley so she could hide inside of her apartment and eat ice cream and cry for an entire day before she had to face anyone.</p><p>But now she\u2019d promised him she wouldn\u2019t leave, and as much as she wanted to break that promise, she wouldn\u2019t. And now she had to sit here and wait, with only her own thoughts for company.</p><p>She thought about calling Maddie, but she knew if she did she would break down on the phone, and the last thing she wanted was to have Drew walk in on her while she was sobbing her heart out over him.</p><p>Instead, she changed, finished packing, and tried and failed to concentrate on work. Finally, she got into Drew\u2019s bed and pulled up Anne of Green Gables on her iPad. Anne was right to smash her slate over Gilbert\u2019s head\u2014fuck him for calling her Carrots.</p><p>Drew got home much later that night, after an easy but long surgery. Thank God it had been an easy one; his mind was half on Alexa the entire time. Part of him was pissed at her that she\u2019d started a fight over what seemed like nothing, but the rest of him was terrified that she\u2019d left and he\u2019d never see her again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>One thing she\u2019d said at the party had kept ringing in his ears: \u201cIn real life, I\u2019m nothing to you.\u201d Was that how she really felt? Was that how he\u2019d made her feel? Because now he realized how far from the truth that was. She meant more to him than he could say. Than he knew how to say.</p><p>The whole way up the stairs to his apartment, he prayed that she\u2019d kept her promise and was still there. He tiptoed into his bedroom, hoping she was there, not sure what to do if she was. He\u2019d been rehearsing what to say the whole drive home, but now everything that he\u2019d thought of seemed stupid and inadequate.</p><p>He stopped in the doorway of his bedroom and sighed in relief. All of his lights were on, and Alexa was asleep in that way that was so familiar to him now, curled up on her side in his bed, the covers pulled up to her chin, her iPad resting on her face.</p><p>He turned the lights off and undressed in the dark. He moved the iPad to the bedside table and crawled in next to her.</p><p>He\u2019d always loved getting in bed with her. It was one of his favorite things about her, the way she would melt into his arms every time he put his arms around her. But this time, she stiffened at his touch. It broke his heart.</p><p>He tightened his arms around her and kissed her neck, her hair, the side of her face. After a few seconds, he felt her relax. He reached up and stroked her hair.</p><p>\u201cAlexa, please. Please, can we talk?\u201d</p><p>She turned in his arms and rested her head against his chest but didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about what I said earlier. I got frustrated, and I didn\u2019t mean it. Please, forgive me, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>Her face was hidden in his chest, so at first, he only heard her irregular breathing and didn\u2019t realize the cause. But when he reached down to stroke her face and tilt it up toward his, he felt the tears on her face.</p><p>\u201cOh no, Alexa. Oh, please no, don\u2019t cry.\u201d He kissed her forehead and pulled her closer to his chest, but she only cried harder.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this, Drew.\u201d He could barely understand her through her sobs. \u201cThis is too . . . It hurts too much. We can\u2019t do this anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d He hoped that he\u2019d heard her wrong, but he knew that wasn\u2019t the case. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not . . . Please don\u2019t do this. Don\u2019t do this to me. To us. Alexa, please. I want this more than anything. You make me so happy. We make me so happy.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and sobbed harder.</p><p>\u201cOh, Drew, you\u2019re so . . . Please don\u2019t make this even . . .\u201d</p><p>He bent down to kiss her wet face, cutting her off before she could finish talking. She kissed him back hard, still hiccupping as her hands roamed his body. He caressed her breasts as he kissed her. He cut off the kiss just long enough to pull her tank top over her head and moved down her body. She dug her fingernails into his shoulders, and he hissed, but she didn\u2019t stop. He didn\u2019t want her to stop.</p><p>He moved farther down her body, knowing by her slightest twist and moan and gasp where he should linger. Her hands were tight in his hair, and he felt the tug on his scalp just before he heard her gasp and felt her contract around him. He lifted his head and looked down at her. Her eyes were closed, but the tears were once again running down her cheeks. He kissed them away.</p><p>She opened her eyes when she heard the crinkle of the condom wrapper opening. He was kneeling between her thighs, looking at her in that way he\u2019d looked at her since the beginning, like he couldn\u2019t wait to touch her, like he couldn\u2019t wait for her to touch him. She couldn\u2019t wait, either.</p><p>She ran her hands up and down his warm chest. He picked up her hands and kissed them. He pinned them above her head, holding on to her wrists with one hand.</p><p>He bent closer to her until his mouth was almost on hers, his body inches away, but he didn\u2019t close the short distance. She moved to meet him, but he moved away, a faint smile dancing around his lips.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I want,\u201d he said. \u201cTell me. Tell me what you want.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him, all warm and golden and strong above her. She said what was in her heart.</p><p>\u201cYou. I want you.\u201d</p> <p>He pushed her legs wide open and slid inside of her. Their twin moans echoed around the room. Too quickly, her whole body tensed and she exploded, tears once again streaming from her eyes, words she knew she would be embarrassed about later coming from her mouth.</p><p>He quickened his pace and came, collapsing on top of her when the tremors throughout his body finally stopped.</p><p>\u201cYou have me,\u201d he said in her ear, so low she wasn\u2019t sure if she\u2019d heard him right.</p><p>When Drew woke up the next morning, she was gone. He turned over in bed and reached for her, but her side of the bed was empty and cold. He sat up and looked around the room. The floor was bare in that corner where he\u2019d been tripping over her suitcase all weekend.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it!\u201d He got out of bed and looked around the apartment, but all evidence of her was gone. He looked for his phone and found it sitting in the middle of the coffee table. Waiting for him.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry about how I acted at the party. You and I both know this is over. I had a great time with you, Drew.</p><p>That was it? That was motherfucking it? \u201cI had a great time with you\u201d??? He\u2019d told her how he felt last night, and then she fucking disappeared in the morning like he was some one-night stand she couldn\u2019t wait to get away from?</p><p>He lay flat on his back on the sofa, still naked.</p><p>How fucking perfect that the first time he\u2019d really cared about a woman in years she\u2019d fled the scene without even saying good-bye. He should tell Molly about this; she\u2019d get a good laugh out of it.</p><p>He sat up and grabbed his phone. He was going to text Alexa back, tell her to get back here, that he wanted to talk to her, this was more than just a great time, why the fuck had she left before they had a chance to talk? He typed out the text to her in a flurry.</p><p>Right before he was about to hit send, he dropped the phone. He tucked it under the couch cushions and sat on it for good measure.</p><p>He flopped onto his back again and covered his head with a couch cushion. Why was he being so fucking emotional? He\u2019d ended things with girls lots of times. Was this how they all felt when he did it?</p><p>He hoped not, otherwise he would feel like an asshole.</p><p>He felt his ass vibrate, sat bolt upright, and fished the phone from underneath it. Maybe she was at the airport and had second thoughts and was texting him to say that she was on her way back. Maybe she was right outside and was texting him to say she was about to knock on the door.</p><p>It was Carlos. Not Alexa.</p><p>Hey man, everything cool with you and Alexa? You disappeared from Heather\u2019s last night.</p><p>Oh, fuck. On top of everything else, he had to apologize to Carlos.</p><p>Hey. Sorry I was an asshole last night.</p><p>He stood up to go flick the switch on the coffeepot, glad that he\u2019d set it up yesterday afternoon.</p><p>We\u2019re cool. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the one you have to worry about, though.</p><p>He stared at his coffeepot, now brewing twice as much coffee as he would need.</p><p>Tell me about it.</p><p>He shook his head. Fuck Alexa. She wasn\u2019t worth all of this. Fuck this emotional bullshit. He was going for a run. Maybe he\u2019d run into Kat.</p><p>Alexa sat on the airplane at LAX and buckled her seat belt. She hoped this damn plane would take off soon so she wouldn\u2019t grab her bag and run back to Drew\u2019s. She\u2019d been sitting at the airport for the past two hours, unshowered, her hair in a messy topknot, no makeup on. And the whole time she\u2019d resisted the temptation to turn around and jump back under his covers and next to his warm, sleeping body before he even realized she was gone.</p><p>Last night before she\u2019d gone to sleep, she\u2019d planned on having an adult conversation with Drew. She wasn\u2019t going to tell him how strong her feelings were for him, because he didn\u2019t need to know that. The last thing she wanted was his pity.</p><p>She\u2019d planned to tell him it was nothing against him, but she knew how he felt about relationships, and she couldn\u2019t do this anymore. She would have just blamed the distance making it tough, and how she couldn\u2019t keep flying up and down the state anymore, how this had been fun for a couple of months, but they both knew it couldn\u2019t last much longer.</p><p>All of that had the benefit of being the truth. It just wasn\u2019t the whole truth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But then he\u2019d crawled into bed with her in the middle of the night and put his arms around her and she\u2019d broken down. All she\u2019d wanted in that moment was to stay right there in his arms forever, to ignore everything in her head telling her this was never going to work and they were too different and wanted different things, and just give in to the warmth and security of his arms.</p><p>The impossibility of that had made her burst into tears. Her, Alexa Monroe, who never cried.</p><p>And when he said sweet things about making it work, she\u2019d lost it completely and sobbed so hard she\u2019d hiccupped. She knew what his version of \u201cmaking things work\u201d was\u2014they\u2019d just keep going the same way they\u2019d been going for a while longer, a few more weeks, a month even, before she\u2019d get his breakup speech and he\u2019d disappear.</p><p>But she wanted so much for it to be true, that he did want to make it work for real. She wanted him to love her and for them to push through all of their problems together because they loved each other enough to be able to do it.</p> <p>So she cried to mourn what could have been, how good his arms felt around her and his chest felt against her face, and how she would never get to feel that again. Her tears had revealed her feelings for him even more than words could have.</p><p>How humiliating. She\u2019d cultivated her poker face for years, and in the most important moment she\u2019d had in years, it had betrayed her in the worst possible way.</p><p>She\u2019d woken up this morning with his arms still around her. She\u2019d been too scared and ashamed to face him and have to see the look of pity on his face, or listen to his platitudes about how it wasn\u2019t her, it was him, and how he hoped they could stay friends. So instead, she\u2019d tiptoed out of his apartment early this morning and dragged her suitcase blocks away so she could get a cab to the airport.</p><p>Was that cowardly of her? Probably, but she\u2019d rather be a coward than break down in front of him again, and in broad daylight this time, so he could see how bad she looked when she cried.</p><p>And then once she actually got to the airport, she had to pay way too much money to get her flight changed from her original one. Maddie, God bless her, had asked no questions when she\u2019d texted her to pick her up from the airport.</p> <p>Maddie was waiting at the curb when Alexa walked out of the airport. Maddie took a long look at her face when she got in the passenger seat.</p><p>\u201cFirst: are we going to your house or my house?\u201d</p><p>Alexa considered as Maddie drove out of the airport.</p><p>\u201cDo you still need my car until you can pick yours up tomorrow? If so, my house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d There was silence as Maddie got on the freeway toward Berkeley. \u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>Alexa dropped her head back against the headrest and closed her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I just want to be somewhere and not not cry.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI\u2019ve spent the past five hours doing everything in my power to not cry. At his house, at the airport, on the plane.\u201d She checked her phone again to see if he\u2019d called. He hadn\u2019t. \u201cNow I can at least stop fighting it.\u201d</p><p>Maddie reached for her hand and squeezed it.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to drive through In-N-Out on the way?\u201d</p><p>Alexa shrugged.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really hungry.\u201d</p><p>Maddie shook her head.</p><p>\u201cNow I know you\u2019re in a bad place. I\u2019m getting you In-N-Out whether you like it or not.\u201d</p><p>When they walked through Alexa\u2019s front door, everything in her house reminded her of Drew. The couch where he\u2019d cried on her shoulder. The towel he\u2019d stolen from the hotel for them to lie on in Dolores Park, now hanging up in her bathroom. The coffee table where he\u2019d set her coffee while she was working. The hoodie that he\u2019d left here on his impromptu trip and that she\u2019d \u201cforgotten\u201d to bring back to him this weekend.</p> <p>She lowered herself down on the couch and put her head in her hands.</p><p>\u201cLex.\u201d She felt Maddie\u2019s hand on her shoulder and leaned into it. Maddie wrapped her arms around her. They sat there like that on the couch for a while, not talking. Eventually, Alexa sighed.</p><p>\u201cYou were right\u2014I want some French fries. You got us ketchup, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Maddie ripped the bags open and unpacked the food on top of the makeshift place mats. \u201cNow. Talk to me.\u201d</p><p>Alexa dropped her head into her hands.</p><p>\u201cOh, Mad. I fucked it all up.\u201d</p><p>Maddie pulled her head onto her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was all going okay. I mean, we hadn\u2019t talked about anything, but the weekend was fine. Great. And then we went to the 4th of July party.\u201d She thought about the party, and the humiliation hit her all over again. \u201cAnd all of these other women . . . They were so nice . . . but they said . . . and he didn\u2019t . . . I\u2019d had too much sangria but . . .\u201d Oh, look, she was sobbing again. Maddie folded her into her arms and let her cry on her shoulder until she was too tired to cry anymore.</p><p>She sat up and took a sip of her drink and ate a handful of cold fries.</p><p>\u201cI guess I should start over again.\u201d She told Maddie the whole story, except for the part about the sex they\u2019d had when she was weeping. That seemed too intimate, too personal, even to tell Maddie. She managed to get through the whole thing without crying, but she\u2019d probably cried out all of her tears.</p><p>\u201cHoney.\u201d Maddie stroked her hair. \u201cAlexa, I love you. I would do anything for you. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>She sighed and nodded. She\u2019d heard this before from Maddie. Enough to know to worry about what was coming next.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Why didn\u2019t you just tell him how you felt about him? And tell him what you wanted? Why did you just disappear this morning?\u201d</p><p>She pushed herself to the other side of the couch.</p><p>\u201cI knew what he was going to say, okay? I didn\u2019t need to hear it.\u201d</p><p>Maddie looked at her. She didn\u2019t smile, or raise her eyebrows, or tilt her head. She just looked at her and wouldn\u2019t let her look away.</p><p>\u201cI was scared! Is that what you want to hear? Okay, fine: I was scared to talk to him! I was scared I would pour out my heart and he would tell me he hoped we could stay friends, I was scared I would see in his face when I started talking that he felt sorry for me, I was scared I\u2019d lay myself bare for nothing, and I was scared I would reveal my whole self to him and he would avert his eyes.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI was scared.\u201d</p><p>Maddie wrapped her back up in a hug.</p><p>\u201cOh, honey.\u201d</p><p>Alexa rested her head on Maddie\u2019s shoulder. Oh, look, she did have more tears in there.</p><p>Maddie sat up.</p><p>\u201cDoes cookie dough ice cream go better with red or white wine?\u201d</p><p>Alexa half laughed, half sobbed.</p><p>\u201cI guess we\u2019re about to find out.\u201d</p><p>Drew saw Kat on his run, but he dodged behind a truck at the last minute to avoid her. He got home in as shitty a mood as when he\u2019d left. He ordered an enormous Hawaiian pizza and opened a bottle of rum, mostly because Alexa hated both. By seven p.m. he never wanted to see another pineapple, but he finished the pizza just to spite her.</p><p>Not that she would ever know, but maybe somewhere she had a terrible taste in her mouth and it was thanks to him.</p><p>He dragged himself into the hospital on Tuesday morning and managed to avoid having a conversation with anyone but his patients and their parents until almost one o\u2019clock. Of course that\u2019s when Carlos burst into his office.</p><p>Fuck. He was grumpy and hungover. He didn\u2019t need to deal with Carlos.</p><p>\u201cNever learned to knock, huh?\u201d He kept his head buried in his stack of files.</p><p>\u201cHow was the rest of your weekend? Everything cool with you and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Drew didn\u2019t even want to hear her name.</p><p>\u201cLeave it alone, Carlos.\u201d</p><p>Carlos moved the stack of books Drew had put on the guest office chair to the floor and plopped down in the chair. Drew scowled. He\u2019d left those books on the chair to keep anyone from sitting there. He should have known that that wouldn\u2019t stop Carlos for a second.</p><p>\u201cNo, really, what happened? She looked pissed at the party even before you said\u2014\u201d</p><p>Drew looked up from the stupid files.</p><p>\u201cI said leave it alone, Carlos.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Did that stop him? No, of course not.</p><p>\u201cCome on, man. You have a fight? It was bound to happen eventually. Tell Dr. Carlos about it. I\u2019ll get you all fixed up.\u201d</p><p>Drew couldn\u2019t take it anymore. He\u2019d slept like shit, because of the rum and the pizza and the absence of Alexa\u2019s soft, welcoming body next to him, his stomach was full of nothing but strong coffee, he had the worst possible taste in his mouth, and Carlos apparently wasn\u2019t getting the message that he didn\u2019t fucking want to talk about it. He pushed himself up from his desk, and his chair slammed back against the wall behind him.</p><p>\u201cI SAID, leave it alone.\u201d</p> <p>He threw open his office door, ignored the stunned look on Carlos\u2019s face, and walked out of the hospital to his car. He had thirty minutes before his next patient; that was enough time to eat something disgusting and terrible for him.</p><p>Alexa walked into City Hall bright and early Tuesday morning. She\u2019d been up since four, so at five thirty she\u2019d given up on more sleep and had gotten ready for work.</p><p>At least she hadn\u2019t dreamed about Drew, though her anxiety dreams all had very loud Drew subtext. Awake, he was never far from her thoughts. She kept thinking of what he would say about her presentation, if he\u2019d thought about her at all, the look on his face when they\u2019d made love that last time, the way he always held her as they slept. It was a lot easier to think about work.</p><p>She brought a carafe of coffee and a box of doughnuts into the office, along with a bag of doughnut holes. She ate the doughnut holes all morning while catching up on email and expense reports, and got so absorbed in the mindlessness of it that she jumped when Sloane exclaimed from her office doorway. \u201cYou brought doughnuts, thank GOD.\u201d Sloane walked in and popped open the box. \u201cWait, all dozen are still here? You haven\u2019t had one yet?\u201d</p><p>If she hadn\u2019t bought herself the bag of doughnut holes, she would have demolished the entire box of doughnuts before anyone else had gotten there.</p> <p>Theo walked in right behind Sloane and dove into the doughnut box. He came up with the maple bar that she\u2019d gotten for him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a queen among women, Lex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is, isn\u2019t she?\u201d Sloane picked up the box. \u201cWant me to bring this out to my desk? Need more coffee?\u201d Alexa nodded to both questions. Theo dropped into her office chair as soon as Sloane left.</p><p>\u201cGot your email last night. Did you see mine?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. She\u2019d seen it at four this morning when she\u2019d woken up and checked her phone. They talked city council strategy as they drank coffee and ate their doughnuts, and argued about whether they could count on Councilman Goode to be on their side or not. The conversation soothed her. This she knew how to do. This she was good at.</p><p>Theo reached for her bag of doughnut holes.</p> <p>\u201cHey, how was your weekend in L.A.?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. If she said anything to Theo, she might break down again, and work was the last place she wanted to do that.</p><p>Well, the last place was probably Drew\u2019s bed at one in the morning with him there to witness it, but work was second to that.</p><p>\u201cOh no, what happened?\u201d Theo asked.</p><p>She shook her head again before he could finish his sentence. He reached for her hand and squeezed it. She squeezed back and let go.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, Teddy. Maybe later.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cOkay. But you know that if you ever want to talk . . .\u201d</p> <p>She nodded down into her coffee. Yes, she did know.</p><p>Theo took a deep breath. \u201cOkay, onto another topic that may also be sensitive: have you talked to Olivia about any of the TARP stuff yet?\u201d</p><p>Alexa looked up from her coffee. Theo was one of the only other people who knew about the history with Olivia. She\u2019d told him all about it on a drunken night last year, right after they\u2019d both had a terrible day at work and when she was already anxious about Olivia coming to visit that weekend.</p><p>\u201cWhat? No, why?\u201d</p><p>He sat back in the chair, crossed his legs and uncrossed them, and sat up again.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to, of course. But I know we talked a while ago about how she might have some ideas that we hadn\u2019t thought of.\u201d</p><p>She started to interrupt, but he kept going.</p><p>\u201cAnd also . . . we have all of those personal stories from people who went through programs like this and turned their lives around, and I thought maybe Olivia might be willing to write something up for us, or . . .\u201d</p><p>Alexa looked down into her coffee again, gazing into the dark brown liquid like it was Dumbledore\u2019s Pensieve. She knew Theo too well to be fooled by this. He was just making up reasons for her to talk to Olivia about TARP. But maybe he was right?</p><p>\u201cI never thought of that,\u201d she said, not looking up at Theo.</p><p>He stood up and walked toward her office door.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to, of course. But . . . maybe you want to? I think she\u2019d be pleased to hear you\u2019re doing this. I bet she\u2019d be pretty touched.\u201d</p><p>Alexa looked up at him, the tears threatening again.</p><p>\u201cSomebody . . . somebody else said that, too. Maybe I will.\u201d</p><p>Theo\u2019s eyebrows went up.</p><p>\u201cYou told . . .\u201d She looked down at her desk, and his voice trailed away. After a minute, he said, \u201cThink about it. It might be good for you to talk to her about it.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d think about it. Maybe Drew had been right about this. Damn him.</p><p>Theo was halfway through her office door before she stopped him.</p><p>\u201cTeddy.\u201d</p><p>He turned around.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. For . . . everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime.\u201d</p><p>Friday after work Drew went home and changed into his running clothes. He ran on the beach for ten miles, trying to exhaust himself so much he didn\u2019t think about Alexa, and how he should be on a plane to go see her at that very moment. It didn\u2019t work.</p><p>The shameful thing was that he\u2019d already bought a ticket to fly up there that weekend. He\u2019d bought it the day before she flew in for the 4th of July weekend, and he hadn\u2019t canceled it yet. He kept thinking he\u2019d hear from her; he\u2019d feel his phone vibrate in his pocket and it would be a text from her. She\u2019d say she was wrong to leave, she\u2019d missed the hell out of him all week just like he\u2019d missed her. And then he would fly up there this weekend, and . . . but that hadn\u2019t happened.</p><p>So he\u2019d canceled his flight right before leaving the office, and now he was even grumpier than he\u2019d been all week. Now it truly felt over.</p><p>He climbed up the stairs to his apartment after his run, hot and sweaty and irritable, but no longer in the kind of mood where he would knock over small children in his path. That mood had been kind of inconvenient for a pediatrician.</p><p>He pulled his house key out of the pocket in his running shorts, confused by the sound of the TV. It must be his neighbors, though they usually . . . oh no.</p><p>\u201cWho the fuck told you to come over?\u201d he said as he opened the door, knowing what he would find. Yep, Carlos sitting on his couch with a beer in his hand.</p><p>\u201cHey, man.\u201d Carlos gestured to the spread on the coffee table. \u201cI brought burgers. And beer.\u201d</p><p>Drew looked at the food. His disloyal stomach growled. Okay, fine. He dried his face with a paper towel and opened the fridge for one of Carlos\u2019s beers. This was bribery, but it\u2019s not like he was going to reject beer. Carlos would just have to deal with his sweat; he\u2019s the one who\u2019d barged in uninvited in the first place.</p><p>He finished a burger and a beer without them saying much to each other except for grunts at the Dodgers game on the TV. Carlos went back to the kitchen and opened two more bottles. Maybe he\u2019d just come over because he wanted company. Maybe Drew had been ignoring his friends because of Alexa, and Carlos had missed him, and was taking advantage of this Friday night that Drew was in town to hang out, watch baseball, eat burgers, drink beer. Maybe . . .</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Carlos turned off the TV and set a beer in front of Drew. \u201cHow drunk do I have to get you before you tell me why you\u2019ve been scaring the nurses and making your patients cry all week?\u201d</p><p>Maybe not.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d Drew downed half the beer. \u201cAnd that kid always cries\u2014it wasn\u2019t my fault.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Carlos shook his head and took a handful of fries.</p><p>\u201cHis mom was crying this time, too.\u201d</p><p>Drew banged the beer down on the table, making it almost overflow.</p><p>\u201cJust because I told her if she had been paying attention to her child, he wouldn\u2019t have gotten injured like that, now I\u2019m the bad guy?\u201d He turned to Carlos, whose mouth was wide open.</p> <p>Drew finished his beer and sighed.</p><p>\u201cFine, I am the bad guy. Get me another beer.\u201d</p><p>Carlos passed him his own untouched beer and stood up to get more.</p><p>\u201cJust tell me what happened,\u201d he said when he got back to the couch. \u201cIt might make you feel better. I assume this is about Alexa, since you\u2019re all sweaty from a run on the beach on Friday night and not from . . .\u201d</p><p>Drew kicked Carlos and he laughed.</p> <p>\u201cWhat, you told me yourself that when the two of you get together, it\u2019s all\u2014\u201d</p><p>Drew threw a French fry at him.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to hear this fucking story, or are you going to keep sitting there making jokes about my girlfriend?\u201d He sighed. \u201cForget I said that; she\u2019s not my girlfriend. She was never my girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>Carlos grabbed a handful of French fries.</p><p>\u201cDid you . . . want her to be your girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>Drew gulped the third beer.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe. It doesn\u2019t matter, though. She hates me now.\u201d</p><p>Carlos raised his eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cDo you not have eyes? Because that\u2019s some bullshit right there. You forget, I\u2019ve seen the two of you together. I\u2019ve seen the way she looks at you. Unless you did something terrible that I don\u2019t know about . . .\u201d</p><p>Drew shook his head. Yeah, maybe she had looked at him like that, but that was before.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you the whole story, then you\u2019ll see.\u201d Apparently the answer to Carlos\u2019s earlier question was: \u201cThree beers.\u201d</p><p>It took him another beer to get all the way to the text message from Monday morning. Why did it hurt so much to tell Carlos what happened?</p><p>\u201cSee? I should have ended this a long time ago, before she could hate me.\u201d</p><p>Carlos looked at the phone for a few seconds, and then up at Drew.</p> <p>\u201cNo, you shouldn\u2019t have ended it a long time ago. What the fuck is wrong with you? You know, I always thought you were kind of an idiot, but I never knew you were this fucking stupid.\u201d</p><p>Drew stood up and kicked the table. Ketchup flew across the floor.</p><p>\u201cI bare my fucking soul to you, tell you how a girl left me asleep and naked in my bed, and this is what I get? Fuck you. Why don\u2019t you spend time dealing with your own fucked-up life, instead of worrying about mine?\u201d</p><p>Carlos looked up at him from the couch with a blank expression on his face. He didn\u2019t budge.</p><p>Drew put his head in his hands and shook his head. What was wrong with him? Carlos didn\u2019t deserve that.</p><p>\u201cSorry. That was a shitty thing to say.\u201d</p><p>Carlos nodded.</p><p>\u201cIt was. Sit down.\u201d</p><p>Drew looked at him, looked at the mess on the floor, then at Carlos again. He sat back down on the couch.</p><p>Carlos sighed and leaned back against the couch cushions.</p><p>\u201cOkay, look. I wasn\u2019t sure whether to tell you this, but after what happened, I think I have to.\u201d</p><p>Drew lunged for him.</p><p>\u201cDid you actually hit on her? You fucking asshole, I never really thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>Carlos pushed him back down on the couch.</p><p>\u201cRelax, dude, of course not. Come on, you know me better than that.\u201d</p><p>Drew leaned back against the couch cushions and sighed.</p><p>\u201cI do. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m a jackass. What terrible thing are you going to tell me now?\u201d</p><p>Carlos stood up and dragged the coffee table back in place.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s something Emma told me after you guys left the party. She said she was feeling kind of bad, because when she and Heather and Robin and Lucy were all in the kitchen with Alexa, they started talking about you.\u201d</p><p>Drew slumped down and reached for a bottle, but they were all empty. Carlos went to the kitchen for more beer for both of them.</p><p>\u201cThis must be bad if you\u2019re bringing me more beer. What did they say?\u201d</p><p>Carlos opened both bottles and sighed.</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess Alexa asked a few questions about you . . . and then they all ended up telling their, um, strikingly similar, I guess, stories of how you broke up with them.\u201d</p><p>Shit. Drew dropped his head in his hands. That was why Alexa had been so upset all of a sudden. Carlos kept talking.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t tell me exactly what they said, and she said Alexa didn\u2019t seem upset about it, but . . .\u201d</p><p>Drew lifted his head.</p><p>\u201cShe does a great fake smile. It fools most people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not you?\u201d Carlos asked, sliding him his beer. Drew pushed it away.</p><p>\u201cBut not me.\u201d He sighed. \u201cShe didn\u2019t tell you what they said?\u201d</p><p>Carlos took a handful of fries.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I can guess.\u201d He raised his eyebrows, and Drew waved at him to continue. Better to get this over with. \u201cI mean, I\u2019ve seen your pattern. After a month or two, when things are going well, you give them the \u2018Let\u2019s be friends\u2019 speech. Maybe she thought that was about to happen to her?\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes. Of course she\u2019d thought that.</p><p>Carlos patted him on the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, man. I think you can fix this.\u201d He paused. \u201cIf you want to fix it?\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t remember ever wanting something more.</p><p>\u201cOf course I want to fix it, just like I want my med school loans to be magically wiped out, and every sick kid in our hospital to be well, and my knee to stop hurting when I run more than ten miles, but I know all of that is impossible, too.\u201d He sat back against the couch cushions, taking his beer with him.</p><p>Carlos put down his food and stood up.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re just going to give up? You\u2019re not even going to try to get her back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat good would it do?\u201d He sighed. \u201cPlus, it\u2019s not like I know how to have a real relationship. Even if it did work, I\u2019d just fuck it up again.\u201d</p><p>Carlos sat back down in the corner of the couch. The asshole was in Alexa\u2019s spot.</p><p>\u201cDid you tell her how you felt about her? How you really feel?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d tried, but . . . He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cForget whether she hates you\u2014she doesn\u2019 t\u2014or if you\u2019d fuck things up again\u2014you would, but you\u2019d figure it out.\u201d Carlos pushed a burger in his direction. He ignored it. \u201cThe real question is: how do you feel about Alexa? Because if you can\u2019t answer that question\u2014honestly, and in a way that satisfies her\u2014there\u2019s no real point in even trying to fix this.\u201d</p><p>Drew closed his eyes. He pictured Alexa laughing up at him in the elevator, Alexa dancing with him at the wedding, Alexa smiling at him from their pilfered towel in Dolores Park, Alexa eating tacos on his couch, Alexa frowning at her computer screen, oblivious to him, Alexa whispering \u201ccoffee\u201d in his ear early in the morning, Alexa pulling his head down onto her shoulder when he\u2019d flown to her side, Alexa tucked inside the curve of his arms in his bed.</p><p>He opened his mouth. But the words stuck in his throat.</p><p>Carlos shook his head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, man. You don\u2019t have to tell me. But you\u2019ve got to tell her.\u201d</p><p>Drew put his head in his hands.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can do this.\u201d</p><p>Carlos leaned back against the couch cushions and propped his feet up on an empty spot on the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only one way to find out.\u201d</p><p>Alexa woke up on Saturday morning, determined that this would be the day that she called Olivia.</p><p>Wednesday, she\u2019d decided for sure to talk to her sister. But she hadn\u2019t wanted to do it when either one of them was at work, because that wasn\u2019t a conversation she wanted to have inside her office when she might be overheard.</p><p>Thursday, she decided to call her when she got home after work, since it would only be around nine or ten New York time and Olivia would still be awake. But by the time she got home that night, it was seven thirty and she decided that was too late. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Friday, she\u2019d admitted to herself she was procrastinating. But she decided Saturday was a better day for a conversation like this anyway. Which meant she had to actually make that call today.</p><p>Or Sunday? Maybe Sunday was an even better day for a call like this?</p><p>She threw back the covers and forced herself out of bed to make coffee. No, she had to do it today. She\u2019d barely been able to concentrate on anything this week, between this hanging over her head and the thoughts of Drew, which were constantly in her head.</p><p>Maddie was right. She should have told him how she\u2019d felt. At least then she wouldn\u2019t have this constant, overwhelming feeling of regret.</p> <p>And at least she wouldn\u2019t feel like such a coward.</p><p>She downed a cup of coffee and shook off the thoughts of Drew. She just needed to get through this week. If she got through the city council meeting on Thursday, win or lose, she could spend the entire next weekend in bed wallowing with French fries and ice cream.</p><p>And Theo\u2014and Drew\u2014were both right that she had to talk to Olivia before the meeting.</p><p>The coffee swirled around in her empty stomach as she picked up the phone. Someday she really should switch to tea. She retreated to bed and got under the covers before she scrolled to Olivia\u2019s name in her phone.</p><p>\u201cHey, kiddo!\u201d Alexa heard street noise in the background. \u201cHow are you this Saturday afternoon?\u201d Olivia laughed. \u201cMorning still for you, I guess.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood!\u201d Alexa could tell her voice was too high and tried to moderate it. \u201cUm, where are you? Are you busy?\u201d</p><p>Maybe she\u2019d be too busy to talk right now and they wouldn\u2019t have to have this conversation?</p><p>\u201cNo, no, just walking home from brunch. What are you up to?\u201d</p><p>Shit, okay, she had to do it, then.</p><p>\u201cJust drinking coffee at home, trying to take a deep breath after a long week.\u201d Well, that was an understatement.</p><p>\u201cYeah? What\u2019s going on? How\u2019s work going?\u201d</p> <p>She just needed to get it out. It was the only way to start this.</p><p>\u201cActually, that\u2019s why I called. I\u2019ve been . . . The mayor has a new initiative for an arts program for at-risk youth, and that\u2019s what I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been reading about that! I had a feeling it was your idea. Great job, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>Alexa took the phone away from her ear and looked at it. Olivia already knew?</p><p>\u201cI, um\u2014you\u2019ve been reading about it?\u201d</p><p>Alexa could hear an elevator ding through Olivia\u2019s laughter.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019ve been reading about it. You think I don\u2019t pay attention to what my little sister is doing? I\u2019m so proud of you for this. City council meeting is this week, right?\u201d</p><p>Alexa sat up in bed. This conversation was not going the way she\u2019d anticipated.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, Thursday. I didn\u2019t know . . .\u201d She stopped and started again. She\u2019d missed out on the opportunity to be honest with Drew; the least she could do was be honest with her own sister. \u201cI was scared to tell you. I didn\u2019t realize you already knew.\u201d</p><p>Alexa could hear Olivia open and close her front door.</p><p>\u201cLexie, why were you scared to tell me? This is a great thing you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>She teared up at the nickname.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to tell you, but we still don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to get through the council. I didn\u2019t want to tell you anything was in the works until it passed. I didn\u2019t want to fail you again.\u201d</p><p>Alexa picked up her coffee cup, realized her hand was shaking, and put it back down on her bedside table.</p><p>\u201cAgain? What do you mean, again?\u201d</p><p>Alexa twisted her sheets around her fingers to stop the trembling.</p><p>\u201cI was so . . . I was terrible to you. When we were in high school and everything blew up, I mean. I was such a bad sister, and I wanted . . . I wanted to make up for that.\u201d</p><p>Oh God, this was even harder than she\u2019d thought it would be. Tears were running down her face now. She hadn\u2019t cried this much in one week since that week she\u2019d gotten her period right before the bar exam.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been worried about that all this time? You don\u2019t have anything to make up for. I know there\u2019s still friction between us sometimes, but that\u2019s not because I\u2019m still mad at you, or hold anything against you for what happened back then. Yes, things were pretty bad that year, but we were kids.\u201d</p><p>Alexa let out a sob. She wiped her face with the bottom of her tank top.</p><p>\u201cI know, but that doesn\u2019t make it okay. I wish I hadn\u2019t been like that to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLexie, you\u2019ve done so much for me!\u201d Olivia said. \u201cYou\u2019ve supported me during times when I needed you the most. You flew to New York at the last minute to move me out of that terrible apartment when I\u2019d gotten dumped, remember? And you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Alexa broke in, still sniffling.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ve never told you how sorry I am! I\u2019m sorry, Livie. I\u2019m so sorry for what I said and how I acted. I\u2019ve regretted it for years, but I\u2019ve been too ashamed and too scared to apologize. I guess this program was going to be my apology, but whether or not the council passes it, I need to say it out loud, too.\u201d</p><p>She could hear sniffling on the other side of the phone now.</p><p>\u201cOh, honey, apology accepted. I\u2019m glad you said it, but I didn\u2019t need to hear it. I always knew you were sorry. I\u2019m so glad my experience inspired you. The teens of Berkeley are lucky to have you championing them.\u201d</p><p>Alexa\u2019s tears kept falling, but they were happy ones now. She got up to pour herself more coffee, and maybe make some toast to settle her stomach.</p><p>\u201cThank you. That means so much for you to say.\u201d</p><p>She could hear the gurgle of Olivia\u2019s coffee maker in the background and almost laughed. Like sister, like sister.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so tell me everything about this TARP program of yours that hasn\u2019t been in the paper\u2014terrible acronym, by the way. Who came up with that? And what ever happened with the dude from the elevator?\u201d</p><p>Alexa reached for the expensive jam from Paris she\u2019d been saving. She deserved it today.</p><p>\u201cOh, Liv, I have so much to tell you.\u201d</p><p>Drew walked through the hospital on Sunday morning, relieved that he\u2019d finally recovered from his hangover from Friday night. Copious amounts of junk food the day before and a long run where alcohol came out of his pores were the only things that stopped his curses at Carlos and all of that damn beer he\u2019d bought.</p><p>If only the solution to what he would do about Alexa was so easy to find. Could he tell her how he felt about her? What if she didn\u2019t feel the same way? Wouldn\u2019t it be easier to pretend he\u2019d never met her?</p><p>These were the questions that had been spinning through his mind for a day and a half, with no answers. He\u2019d been all ready to text her on Friday night, but Carlos confiscated his phone. Probably for the best; the half-written text he saw when he woke up Saturday morning said something nonsensical about how much he missed her naked body against his\u2014while that was true, it was probably the wrong way to approach this problem. He didn\u2019t know the right way yet.</p><p>He got up to the fifth floor and waved at the nurse at the desk. He ducked his head into the third room on the left and found who he was looking for.</p><p>\u201cHey, buddy, how are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Nick!\u201d Jack grinned at him from his chair and waved. \u201cDid you come to visit me?\u201d</p><p>He walked over and sat down next to him, exchanging smiles with Abby.</p><p>\u201cSure did. Haven\u2019t seen you in a little while. Wanted to check and see how one of my favorite dudes is doing.\u201d</p><p>He sat back and let Jack\u2019s animated chatter wash over him until it slowed and finally stopped.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s asleep,\u201d he said to Abby. She\u2019d been pretending to read her book the whole time they talked, but he\u2019d noticed that she hadn\u2019t turned a page.</p><p>\u201cYeah, the chemo takes a lot out of him.\u201d She closed her book and smiled at him. \u201cThanks for coming by, though. I know he loved seeing you.\u201d</p><p>He looked over at Jack, who looked even younger than usual, sound asleep and hooked up to multiple IVs.</p><p>\u201cI loved seeing him, too, even though it\u2019s tough to see him like this.\u201d Tears jumped to Abby\u2019s eyes, and he felt like an ass. If it was hard for him to see Jack like this, how did he think his mother felt? \u201cI talked to Dr. Sullivan, though; she said his prognosis is good. She seemed very hopeful.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Abby wiped the tears out of her eyes and smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cShe said that to us, too, but it\u2019s good that wasn\u2019t just what she says to parents. Thanks for telling me that. I know doctors tell one another the real story.\u201d</p><p>He touched Jack\u2019s head, careful not to wake him up.</p><p>\u201cNo problem. I was . . . I was pretty worried about him. I was very relieved when I talked to Dr. Sullivan, though\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Abby closed her book and tucked it in her purse.</p><p>\u201cI know, there are no guarantees. Thanks, regardless.\u201d She looked at his hand, still on Jack\u2019s head. \u201cHow\u2019s your friend Alexa?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. He should have anticipated that Abby would bring up Alexa.</p><p>\u201cThat bad, huh?\u201d Abby said, as he looked for a way to answer. \u201cCan I assume that she is . . . or was . . . more than a friend?\u201d</p><p>He made a face at her, and she laughed.</p> <p>\u201cLike you didn\u2019t already know that.\u201d He sighed. \u201cThis is not a normal doctor-patient conversation, but . . . we hit a roadblock. Time will tell if it\u2019s a bump in the road or more of a brick wall.\u201d</p><p>She sat back in her chair and folded her hands.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing from the look on your face that you want it to be the former?\u201d</p><p>He moved his hand from Jack\u2019s head and looked her in the eye.</p><p>\u201cMore than anything. I just don\u2019t quite know how to make that happen.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him.</p> <p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s easy. What does she want more than anything, even if she hasn\u2019t told you? Do that for her.\u201d</p><p>He let out a bark of laughter, checked to make sure he hadn\u2019t woken Jack up, and kept laughing more quietly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s easy? Good Lord, what\u2019s hard to you?\u201d He glanced back at Jack. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Now Abby laughed.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t even going to play the kid-with-cancer card, but you did it for me. Look, if you want to be with her, which from the look on your face you do, find a way to be with her. It\u2019s really as simple as that, once you clear away everything else.\u201d</p><p>He laughed again.</p><p>\u201cWell, when you put it that way . . .\u201d Actually, when she put it that way, it really was that simple.</p><p>He closed his eyes and nodded. Now he knew what he had to do. What he wanted to do. He just hoped this was what Alexa wanted, too. Or else he\u2019d look like a real idiot.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you put it that way, you might be right.\u201d He stood up. \u201cThanks, Abby. I hope you\u2019ve solved my problem for me.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him and ran her hand over Jack\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cI hope so, too. Keep me posted, will you?\u201d</p><p>He saluted her on his way out of the room.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>He went straight to his office. He had a phone call to make.</p><p>Alexa was at work by seven in the morning on the day of the city council meeting, even though it didn\u2019t start until six that night. At this point, being at work was easier than being at home. At work there was something for her to do, she felt needed, she felt important. At home she was alone with her thoughts and with reminders of Drew. They\u2019d known each other for two months, and he\u2019d only been to her house a handful of times, so why did she see him everywhere there?</p><p>At some point, she hoped that would fade. Maybe after the council meeting and she had her ritual fire of everything Drew related.</p><p>She was only kidding about that ritual fire. Sort of.</p><p>She was in her office on her third run through of her city council presentation when Sloane carried in two big pink bakery boxes.</p><p>\u201cDelivery for you, Alexa, but if this is what I think it is, you\u2019d better share.\u201d</p><p>Alexa perched on the corner of her desk and opened both boxes. They were overflowing with doughnuts of every variety. Four pink frosted doughnuts with sprinkles were in the center of each box.</p><p>\u201cWhere did this come from? I was going to bring doughnuts this morning but had too much to carry on my way in to pick these up. Who got these, Theo?\u201d</p><p>Sloane flipped one of the boxes closed and pointed to the note on top that Alexa had overlooked.</p><p>\u201cLook and see.\u201d</p><p>She pulled the folded white envelope from the top of the box and opened it.</p><p>Alexa\u2014Good luck today! Drew</p><p>She hadn\u2019t heard from him since she left his bed at dawn almost two weeks ago, and he\u2019d sent her doughnuts? And he\u2019d remembered when the city council meeting was? Was this the Alexa version of Emma\u2019s breakup flowers?</p><p>She tucked the card back in its envelope and slid it into her purse anyway.</p><p>\u201cCan you put these in the kitchen, Sloane? And send out an email to everyone to let them know there are doughnuts? Wait, hold on a second.\u201d She plucked two of the pink frosted ones out of one of the boxes. \u201cOkay, now you can take them away.\u201d</p><p>Sloane picked up both boxes and turned to leave.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to kill it today, boss.\u201d</p><p>Alexa put her doughnuts on a napkin.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Sloane. I hope so. I told you to order pizza for everyone\u2019s lunch, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready done,\u201d Sloane called out from the doorway.</p><p>The day dragged, as days with something important at the end of them always did, but finally the clock hit five, her signal to close her office door and change into her lucky suit and heels. She opened her door when she was done to find Theo standing behind it.</p><p>\u201cArmor on?\u201d he asked. \u201cAre we ready to go?\u201d</p><p>She grinned at him, suddenly full of adrenaline.</p><p>\u201cYou know it. Let\u2019s go kick some city council ass.\u201d</p><p>Drew slipped through the doorway of the city council chambers right at six. He\u2019d wanted to get there early, but he didn\u2019t want Alexa to see him before the meeting started. She hadn\u2019t acknowledged the doughnuts, but he knew she\u2019d gotten them; he\u2019d followed the delivery guy to her office to make sure.</p><p>He found one of the only empty seats in the back of the council chamber, next to a black woman with lots of curly hair who looked vaguely familiar. She looked up and smiled at him for a second before looking back down her phone, her thumbs flying across the screen.</p><p>He saw Alexa up at the front of the room, sitting next to Theo and behind a white-haired man he assumed was the mayor. Damn, it felt so good to see her again, even from across the room. She was sitting there, intent on the proceedings, in one of those suits he loved, looking like she was in her element. She was in her element.</p><p>Maybe she was relieved to not have him taking up her time anymore. Maybe Theo had already pounced\u2014see, right there, he\u2019d put his hand on her shoulder\u2014and they were as happy as could be together. Had he flown up here for nothing?</p><p>He took a deep breath. He couldn\u2019t back out now\u2014both Abby and Carlos would kill him, among other things. Hell with it, he didn\u2019t want to back out now; he had to know for sure.</p><p>He saw on the agenda that there was some business to get through first, so he pulled his phone out to pass the time.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you here for?\u201d the woman next to him whispered.</p><p>\u201cOh, the teen arts thing.\u201d He smiled and gestured to the front of the room. \u201cMy . . . A friend of mine works for the mayor, so I wanted to be here for her.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cOh? Who\u2019s your friend?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated before he answered, but she was looking at him so intently that he had to.</p><p>\u201cAlexa Monroe, she\u2019s the mayor\u2019s chief of staff.\u201d He couldn\u2019t keep the smile off his face as he said her name.</p><p>The woman dropped her phone into her purse and turned to him with a wide smile. Why was he reminded of a wolf?</p><p>\u201cYou must be Drew,\u201d she said.</p><p>At that, everything clicked. Boy, did he feel like an idiot for not figuring this out sooner. He sat up straight.</p><p>\u201cAnd you must be Olivia?\u201d That\u2019s why she looked familiar; he\u2019d seen pictures of her around Alexa\u2019s house.</p><p>She nodded and reached out her hand. He hadn\u2019t been so nervous about a handshake since his med school interviews.</p><p>\u201cI was under the impression that you and my sister were no longer . . . friends?\u201d She still had that smile on her face.</p><p>He nodded, then shook his head. Words, Drew, it was time for words.</p><p>\u201cI hope . . . There have been some problems, but my hope is that we\u2019re still friends.\u201d He laughed under his breath. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not what I want. I don\u2019t want to be friends with your sister\u2014I want a lot more.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Olivia\u2019s smile lost some of the animosity.</p><p>\u201cGood. Because if you answered that question a different way, I was going to tell you to walk out of this room right now and get your ass back to Los Angeles.\u201d</p><p>He laughed again, louder this time, causing the people in front of him to turn around and frown. He muttered an apology.</p><p>He turned back to Alexa\u2019s sister.</p> <p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m here. So if you could . . .\u201d</p><p>She patted him on the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t spoil your surprise. I wouldn\u2019t anyway, but she doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m here, either, so I\u2019d spoil my own surprise, too.\u201d</p><p>He suddenly realized something: if Olivia was here, Alexa must have taken his advice and told her about the program. He couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d listened to him.</p><p>He turned to Olivia to say something else, but she shushed him and pointed to the front of the room.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re talking about it now.\u201d</p><p>Alexa had expected to be jittery, but she\u2019d felt a weird sense of calm descend upon her as soon as she\u2019d walked into the chambers. She\u2019d done all that she could do, and whether she won or lost, she knew she\u2019d won in the eyes of her sister, no matter what.</p><p>But she still wanted to win.</p><p>She spent the first half of the meeting scribbling notes to both the mayor and Theo, and getting scribbled notes from them in return. They\u2019d learned the hard way to always write their notes to one another during council meetings on paper instead of via email or text, since that time a local newspaper had tweeted a picture of the mayor looking at his phone during a council meeting and he\u2019d gotten roundly mocked.</p><p>When it was time for her presentation, she stood in front of the podium, all of her anxiety for the week gone. The city council had already gotten her report, so this part was pure theater.</p><p>\u201cMayor, Councilwomen, Councilmen, you\u2019ve all seen the proposal about the Teen Arts Rehabilitation Program, or TARP. At this point, I\u2019ll just go into a few details about the program before alumni of similar programs report to you about the benefits they received from it, and then we\u2019ll open it up to questions and public comment.\u201d</p> <p>She went through her presentation, pleased that almost everyone on the council nodded and smiled at her, and the only ones who didn\u2019t were the two who\u2019d been opposed to the program from the beginning.</p><p>Then came the alumni of various programs, handpicked by Theo: one was a student at UC Berkeley who had done a program like this in East L.A.; another was a recently published author who credited her youth arts and writing program for putting her on the path to where she was. Theo had spent days coaching them on what to emphasize, and Alexa saw him tense up and lean in their direction as they started talking. But after a few initial stumbles, both of them had the council in the palm of their hands.</p><p>The council chair opened up the discussion for public comment, and now it was Alexa\u2019s turn to tense up. After that meeting in the hills, she was afraid of who was going to be at this meeting, and what they would say. Sure, they\u2019d reached out to all of the communities who they knew supported the program to encourage them to come, and Alexa could see a good number of them in the audience, but there were also lots of faces there that she didn\u2019t recognize. Who knew what they would say?</p><p>The first two speakers were people she knew were on their side. But the next two were people who had been visibly skeptical at the meeting in the hills. And yet, they both spoke in support of the program.</p><p>She looked over at Theo, who stared straight back at her, his eyes dancing, and down at Maddie, in one of the front rows. She couldn\u2019t smile, not yet.</p><p>But it kept going on like that. Sure, there were a few people who opposed it, who said that kids needed discipline, needed to be punished for their transgressions, that this was soft on crime, and all of those reasons she\u2019d heard before. But the vast majority of the crowd was on their side. She couldn\u2019t believe it.</p><p>She looked down at her notebook to doodle something so she wouldn\u2019t grin like a loon. When she looked up, she almost jumped out of her seat. Standing there at the microphone was Olivia.</p><p>\u201cMayor, Councilwomen, Councilmen, thank you for this opportunity. As some of you may know, I grew up right here in the Bay Area, though I live far away now. I spent my time in high school getting in and out of trouble, and finally I went too far. Thank God I got sent to a program very much like the one being debated today. That program opened my eyes to all of the things that I could do, all of the things that I could accomplish, if I moved beyond my teenage rebellion and concentrated on what mattered. Since then, I\u2019ve graduated from two top schools and have recently become a partner at a law firm in New York City. There are many teenagers out there like I was, teens who need someone to help put them on the right track, but who could so easily get pushed onto the wrong path altogether, and never find a way off it. I\u2019m so glad that my arts rehabilitation program showed me my path to success, and I hope you\u2019ll open up those pathways for the youth of Berkeley who need it the most.\u201d</p> <p>Alexa had tears in her eyes by the middle of Olivia\u2019s speech, and had to look up at the ceiling by the end of it so the tears wouldn\u2019t fall. When she managed to look down, Olivia was looking right at her, and they smiled at each other during the loud applause.</p><p>No one was surprised when the council voted to approve the pilot program, not after that speech. Alexa was grateful Theo grabbed her in a big bear hug, so she could hide her huge grin against his shoulder. She was so amped up that she could barely concentrate on the thirty minutes of public debate about the new bike lane on Oxford Street.</p><p>Finally, the meeting ended and Alexa jumped to her feet, intent on finding Olivia. She couldn\u2019t get to her right away, because almost everyone on the council walked up to thank her. And then when the council was done, it was the mayor\u2019s turn to wrap her up in a hug.</p><p>\u201cYou made me proud tonight, Alexa.\u201d</p><p>She wiped her eyes as she pulled back. This time, she wasn\u2019t even ashamed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me cry, sir. Just doing my job.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and patted her on the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better not be in the office until noon tomorrow, and that\u2019s an order, you hear me?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t even attempt to argue.</p><p>\u201cAye aye, sir.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed Theo\u2019s shoulder, hugged him, too, and handed him a few twenties.</p><p>\u201cI know your whole crew likely has plans for drinks. You all have fun. I\u2019m going home.\u201d He winked. \u201cDon\u2019t do anything I wouldn\u2019t do.\u201d</p><p>They waved good-bye to the mayor, and Alexa picked up her overstuffed purse. Okay, NOW she could go find her sister.</p><p>She walked down into the audience seats of the council chamber, her eyes intent on Olivia\u2019s hair; it made her easy to find.</p><p>\u201cOlivia!\u201d She shouted her sister\u2019s name, no longer worried about keeping to her inside voice. When Olivia turned around, the man beside her turned along with her. Alexa took a step back.</p><p>\u201cDrew?\u201d</p><p>He was in front of her in a flash, Olivia behind him.</p><p>\u201cHi. Great job up there,\u201d he said.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t believe he was here.</p><p>\u201cDrew?\u201d She needed to come up with something more to say than just his name. She wanted to reach for him, throw her arms around him, bury her face in his warm chest and let him hold her for days, pull him into her house and never let him out. \u201cHave you been . . . What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He crossed his arms, then uncrossed them.</p><p>\u201cI came to see your night of triumph. Are you, um, glad that I\u2019m here?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. After the night that she\u2019d had, any sort of prevarication was impossible.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t be gladder that you\u2019re here. Although\u201d\u2014she looked around him to meet Olivia\u2019s eyes\u2014\u201cI\u2019m pretty happy to see my sister, too.\u201d</p><p>Drew and Olivia looked at each other and laughed.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t plan this! We promise!\u201d Olivia said, and pulled her into a hard hug. \u201cI\u2019m going to follow Theo and the rest of your little band. I assume you\u2019re all off for a drink or five?\u201d</p><p>Alexa nodded. This might be one of the weirdest nights of her life. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, at the Blue Lounge, but wait\u2014\u201d</p><p>Olivia shook her head and gestured to Drew.</p><p>\u201cYou have other things to deal with right now. Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll catch up later.\u201d</p><p>Had Olivia and Drew talked about her? Where had they even met? What was he doing here? Alexa reached out and grabbed Olivia\u2019s hand before she walked away.</p> <p>\u201cWait, Livie . . . Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Olivia squeezed her hand.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, kiddo. It was my pleasure.\u201d</p><p>By the time Olivia walked out the door with Theo and Maddie, the council chambers were deserted. Just Alexa and Drew were left.</p><p>\u201cThank you for the doughnuts,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was so sweet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re very welcome.\u201d He reached out to her and touched her upper arm. She had to fight to not sway toward him. \u201cI hoped they would start the day out on a good note.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, thinking back to her first bite into the still-warm doughnut.</p><p>\u201cThey did.\u201d She gave up the fight and leaned into his hand for a moment. \u201cDrew, what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He dropped his hand. It was probably for the best, but she still missed his touch.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here . . . Shit, I had a whole beginning to this, and now I\u2019ve forgotten it all.\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cEverything went wrong that weekend.\u201d</p><p>Now she reached out and grabbed his hand. She couldn\u2019t help herself.</p> <p>\u201cDrew, that\u2019s all my fault. I shouldn\u2019t have started that fight at the party. And I shouldn\u2019t have left without saying good-bye. I\u2019m sorry. I should have just talked to you like a grown-up.\u201d</p><p>He tightened his grip on her hand when she went to pull away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, too. I should have been honest about how I felt.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to hear the rest. Not tonight. Probably not ever.</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t worry about it. You didn\u2019t have to come all the way up here about that. I know how you feel; it\u2019s okay.\u201d Shit, was she going to start crying again? At this point, she couldn\u2019t even be embarrassed about it.</p><p>\u201cNo, Alexa. You don\u2019t know.\u201d He released her hand and took a step back. \u201cI never told you this, but I changed my flight back to L.A. that day, so I could spend more time with you.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him and narrowed her eyes. Why was he telling her something she already knew?</p><p>\u201cI knew that. I was right there when you changed it.\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNo. Not after the conference. After the wedding.\u201d</p><p>She let her purse slide off her shoulder and onto the floor. Her mind was a jumble. She felt drunk. Was it all of the doughnuts and pizza? Or maybe the many cups of coffee?</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, after the wedding? Your flight was that night, right?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cMy flight was at noon. When you were in the bathroom that morning, I changed my flight so I could spend the day with you. I should have realized then that I could never get enough of you.\u201d</p><p>What was he saying? Why was he saying this now?</p><p>\u201cDrew, I . . .\u201d</p><p>He reached for her hand again.</p><p>\u201cNo, let me finish, let me get this out. You . . . I . . . Alexa, I can\u2019t imagine my life without you. I haven\u2019t been able to since I first met you in that elevator. When I woke up that morning and you weren\u2019t there . . . it broke me. I tried to live without you, but I couldn\u2019t. I can\u2019t.\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cAlexa, I love you. I love you so much.\u201d</p><p>She tried to release his hand, but he held on tight. Her eyes filled with tears.</p><p>\u201cDrew, I . . . Are you sure?\u201d</p><p>He smiled and took another step toward her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been more sure about anything.\u201d</p><p>Telling Alexa that he\u2019d loved her hadn\u2019t been as hard as he\u2019d thought it would be. As a matter of fact, he wanted to keep saying it, over and over. But did she feel the same way? He couldn\u2019t tell. All he knew was her hand was in his and she was here with him.</p><p>He might as well tell her everything.</p><p>\u201cLook.\u201d He held out his phone to her. She looked at him with a question in her eyes but took it anyway. \u201cThis is how sure I am. Read this email.\u201d</p><p>She cleared her throat and looked at his phone. He was still gripping her hand.</p><p>\u201cDrew Nichols, Children\u2019s Hospital of Oakland is pleased to offer you the position of . . .\u201d Her voice trailed away. \u201cIs this for real?\u201d</p><p>He took the phone out of her hand.</p><p>\u201cVery much for real. I called my mentor on Sunday. He told me when I saw him before the wedding that there was going to be a job opening up here and tried to get me to apply for it. I said no then, but . . . I changed my mind. It was a little more complicated than he\u2019d implied, and I can\u2019t start until\u2014\u201d</p><p>She threw her arms around him and buried her head in his chest. She was crying again, but he hoped that these were good tears. He pulled her tight against him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only going to take it if you want me to,\u201d he said against her ear. \u201cPlease tell me you do?\u201d</p><p>She turned her head and pulled his head down to hers for a long kiss. Eventually, he pulled back and wiped the tears from her face with his thumb. My God, he\u2019d missed her so much.</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>She smiled up at him, her eyes sparkling through her tears.</p><p>\u201cYes, I want you to take it.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her eyelids, her cheeks, her hair.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have something else to tell me?\u201d he said, his lips a breath away from hers.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d The tears streamed from her eyes as she said it. \u201cOh, Drew, I love you so much. I\u2019ve been trying to deny to myself all week how much I love you.\u201d</p><p>He brushed her tears away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to admit to myself how much I love you.\u201d</p><p>He held her face in his hands and kissed her, their tears mingling with each other\u2019s, their bodies fitting together like they were made to be just like that.</p><p>\u201cMizz Monroe?\u201d The voice came from the doorway. Alexa put her head on his shoulder, laughing into his mascara-stained shirt before she turned toward the security guy. \u201cI was going to lock up. Should I, um . . .\u201d</p><p>Alexa cleared her throat.</p><p>\u201cSorry about this, Stu. You can lock up. Let me just get my stuff.\u201d</p><p>She picked her purse back up from where she\u2019d dropped it on the ground and took Drew\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go home.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her hand and walked with her out the door.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you forgetting that we have to meet up with everyone from your office?\u201d</p><p>She stopped and laughed as she wiped her face with the sleeve of her suit jacket.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe it, but I had forgotten that. I\u2019ll text Theo; he\u2019ll understand. Olivia can come over . . . a little bit later.\u201d</p><p>Drew shook his head. He wanted nothing more than to take her straight home and make up for all of their lost time, but he knew she\u2019d regret missing out on this night with her crew.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, you can\u2019t not go. This is your night of triumph!\u201d He took her heavy bag from her and tossed it over his own shoulder.</p><p>She smiled up at him.</p><p>\u201cSee, this is why I love you.\u201d</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>\u201cThis is it? Of all the things it could be, me sending you out to have drinks with your coworkers instead of locking you in the bedroom with me is why you love me?\u201d</p><p>She reached for his hand and squeezed it.</p><p>\u201cYeah. It is.\u201d</p><p>He lifted their joined hands and kissed hers.</p><p>\u201cNow, let\u2019s get you into the bathroom to wash your face before your whole office sees you with raccoon eyes. Plus, if you walk in there looking like that, your sister is going to draw and quarter me.\u201d</p><p>She laughed.</p><p>\u201cCome with me upstairs to my office so I can repair myself.\u201d She pulled his face down so she could whisper in his ear. \u201cAnd you know, my office door locks, so no one will interrupt us there.\u201d</p><p>He liked the sound of that. He gestured to the hallway with his free hand.</p><p>\u201cLead the way, Monroe.\u201d</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t Carlos meet us at the restaurant?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They walked into the Fairmont, almost a year after they\u2019d met there. Carlos was in town and was staying there for some reason, instead of one of the more convenient hotels downtown. Drew had insisted on meeting him in his room, instead of at the restaurant where they were having dinner. Alexa was trying not to complain about it, but it was a Thursday night at seven, she\u2019d had a long day, and she was ready for a cocktail and an enormous plate of French fries.</p><p>\u201cHe needs your opinion on his outfit. I don\u2019t know.\u201d Drew had been distracted their whole drive there and kept checking his phone. She knew he had a few patients he was worried about, but this was unusual for him.</p><p>She pressed the button for the elevator and looked up at him and smiled, ready to reminisce about their elevator, but he wasn\u2019t looking at her; he was looking off in the distance. Okay. She tried not to take it personally.</p><p>In the past year, they\u2019d had their ups and downs. They\u2019d learned how to deal with two busy careers and a relationship, too; what the other person was like on an early Monday morning and a stressful Thursday night instead of just their idyllic weekends; that she never made the bed; that Drew always left the lights on.</p> <p>They\u2019d also learned how to talk to each other about their feelings, even when they were scary. And throughout everything, they\u2019d loved each other. Those two things helped them get over all of the bumps, big and little.</p><p>The corner elevator\u2014their elevator\u2014opened, and he grabbed her hand and led her inside. She looked up at him to ask another question, saw something out of the corner of her eye, and turned.</p><p>There were bouquets of flowers lining the elevator. Deep red roses, fat pink peonies, bright orange gerbera daisies, golden yellow daffodils, purple lilacs, all in vases along the floor. In one corner was a picnic basket, in another was an ice bucket with a bottle of champagne inside, and a pink bakery box was in the middle.</p><p>\u201cDrew? What\u2019s . . . Is this . . . Are we . . .\u201d She didn\u2019t even know what to ask him. At first, she\u2019d thought it must be some mistake, but then she saw the way he was smiling at her, looking relaxed for the first time that day. He took both of her hands in his, and her whole body warmed at his touch.</p><p>\u201cAlexa. I love you. I love you so much. You know that, right?\u201d</p> <p>She nodded, tears springing into her eyes. Damn this man for always making her cry. Except now, almost always, it was from joy.</p><p>\u201cMe, too. I love you so much, too.\u201d</p><p>The elevator shuddered to a stop, and she looked around and laughed.</p><p>He kissed one of her hands.</p><p>\u201cI know you do. We met right here, three hundred sixty-four days ago, and it was the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to me.\u201d He pulled her down to the floor, where they sat cross-legged, like they had the last time they\u2019d been stuck in an elevator together. \u201cAlexa Monroe, will you marry me?\u201d</p><p>A tear slid down her cheek. At least she\u2019d switched to waterproof mascara ever since Drew had moved to Berkeley.</p> <p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll marry you. I would LOVE to marry you.\u201d She pulled his face toward hers, and they kissed until they were lying on the floor, the flowers surrounding them.</p><p>He pulled back and smiled at her, then sat bolt upright.</p><p>\u201cWait! I forgot something!\u201d He reached in his pocket and pulled out a jewelry box. \u201cDo you like it? I had Maddie give me some ideas, but if you . . .\u201d</p><p>She held out her left hand for him to slide the ring on her finger. She glanced down and saw the sparkle but couldn\u2019t keep her eyes off the look on his face. She couldn\u2019t remember ever having been this happy in her life.</p><p>\u201cThe ring is perfect, and I can\u2019t believe Maddie was able to keep this secret from me.\u201d She looked around at the elevator. \u201cHow did you manage to do this? How long do we get the elevator for? Wait. Carlos isn\u2019t really upstairs, is he?\u201d</p><p>He intertwined their hands and laughed.</p><p>\u201cNope, safe and sound in L.A. We only get the elevator for thirty minutes, and that took a lot of sweet-talking to the hotel manager and implied promises of having a wedding here. I wanted to do this tomorrow, on our actual elevator anniversary, but I had to compromise. I hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind a single thing right now.\u201d</p> <p>He grinned at her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to open that bottle of champagne as soon as I manage to let go of you. We don\u2019t have much time to drink it.\u201d</p><p>He seemed in no hurry to let go of her, though, and she was in no hurry for him to let her go. He wrapped his arms around her again, and they sat there on the floor together, her head against his chest. After a minute or so, he gestured to the picnic basket and said the magic words.</p><p>\u201cI brought the fancy cheese and crackers this time.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
