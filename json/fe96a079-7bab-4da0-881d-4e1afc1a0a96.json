What about your studies? We were going to wait, Bronwyn, remember? Just tell me you\u2019re joking?\u201d Bronwyn felt her husband\u2019s furious words strike her like boulders. She stared up into his livid face and didn\u2019t recognize the man standing in front of her. He was shocked, that was all. He was thrown by her news. Her words would sink in soon enough and he\u2019d go back to being the man she adored, the wonderful man to whom she had entrusted her heart. She just needed to give him time to get over his shock. The more she tried to rationalize his inexplicable reaction to what should have been joyous news, the more the insidious little voice in the back of her mind kept telling her that she was lying to herself. This was a side of Bryce that she had never seen before\u2014one that he had never allowed her to see\u2014and she was terrified of what that said about their two-year marriage.</p><p>\u201cI know that it\u2019s sooner than we\u2019d planned,\u201d she said softly, trying to maintain an even tone of voice. \u201cBut this is the reality of our situation now, and it can\u2019t be changed. We\u2019re having a baby . . . a baby, Bryce. Don\u2019t you get how wonderful that is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you did this. I can\u2019t believe you would stoop to this,\u201d he gritted out bitterly. \u201cThis was supposed to be a joint decision. I\u2019m not ready for this, Bronwyn. I don\u2019t want a kid, damn it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s our baby. We made it together,\u201d she protested, trying and failing to keep the pain and confusion from her voice. She tried to find a glimmer of her kind and loving Bryce beneath the mask of anger and frustration that he was displaying, but he wasn\u2019t there. She wondered if he had ever been there.</p><p>\u201cYou mean you made it, without my consent.\u201d He could barely meet her eyes, and she was grateful for that because the tears that she had been struggling to keep at bay were finally winning the battle.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re being like this,\u201d she cried. \u201cI didn\u2019t plan this; it just happened. Our birth control failed. I asked the doctor and he said that if I\u2019d had a stomach virus or anything like that it could have provided a window of opportunity. And remember? I was sick a couple of days before your company party three months ago.\u201d He strode out of the conservatory without a word and she followed him as he made his way downstairs to their en suite. She watched in sick disbelief as he opened the medicine chest and yanked out her birth-control pills.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d She tried to maintain her composure as he counted the pills left in the box and felt the hope that she had been clinging to shrivel up into a tiny ball inside her chest and die. She felt nauseated as she watched the man she had married turn into a monster right in front of her. Slowly the confused mortification turned to fury. How could he do this to her? How could he humiliate her like this?</p><p>\u201cGod, have you been chucking pills down the drain every night?\u201d he wondered out loud, and she found herself almost hating him for asking the question.</p><p>\u201cYou know I wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I? Well I obviously don\u2019t know you as well as I thought I did, do I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you know me, Bryce.\u201d She tried to appeal to the reasonable man who had to be in there somewhere and laid a tentative hand on his rigid forearm, but he yanked his arm away and turned away from her.</p><p>\u201cGet out of here,\u201d he whispered harshly, and Bronwyn felt something give way and break at those four words.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She must have misheard him. Still she tried to give him the benefit of the doubt.</p><p>\u201cGet the hell out,\u201d he said before turning to face her. Bronwyn tried not to flinch when she saw his face. There was nothing there\u2014no anger, no regret, just a blank mask. She didn\u2019t know this man at all. \u201cGo now.\u201d</p><p>She sobbed, whirled from the room, and did as he had commanded. She fled.</p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>TWO YEARS LATER</p><p>She had been working for less than two hours and already she knew that it had been a mistake to come in. But not showing up for work meant not getting paid, and that would be disastrous. She needed her job desperately and couldn\u2019t risk losing it.</p><p>A bout of flu had wiped her out for nearly a week, leaving her without an income and dangerously low on resources. Though she still felt a bit shaky, she had dragged herself in to work that morning. But no sooner had she walked through the front door of the busiest, trendiest beachfront restaurant in Plettenberg Bay, than she comprehended what a grave error in judgment she had made. She was muddling up her orders, breaking dishes, and walking blindly into her fellow servers. She knew that the manager\u2014who already felt that her personal circumstances were incompatible with her working environment\u2014was just itching to fire her. Now she was basically handing him an excuse to get rid of her.</p><p>She valiantly soldiered on, hoping against hope that Gerhard would, by some miracle, take pity on her and keep her on his books. A young couple with a baby cart made their way into her section and she shuffled over to them, her lack of enthusiasm obvious with every reluctant step. The couple were leaning into one another, whispering and laughing intimately, while the baby slept peacefully in its stroller. The pair looked very much in love and pretty much oblivious to the rest of the world.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon,\u201d she murmured, so focused on keeping her nausea at bay that she barely glanced at them. \u201cWould you like anything to drink?\u201d The woman looked up and started to say something, but she was interrupted by her companion, who swore viciously before jumping to his feet like a scalded cat.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh my God! Bronwyn?\u201d</p><p>Bronwyn gasped and raised one shaking hand to her mouth to stifle a shocked cry when she recognized the handsome man standing in front of her. Her vision blurred and she blinked rapidly to clear it. The baby, clearly startled by the man\u2019s harsh voice, started crying.</p><p>\u201cSo this is where you have been hiding out all this time?\u201d The shock had disappeared from his voice to be replaced by contempt.</p><p>\u201cRicky,\u201d she moaned shakily, overwhelmed by love, fear, and relief all at the same time.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that!\u201d he growled in warning, and she flinched. \u201cGod, you\u2019re an ice-cold bitch, aren\u2019t you? How could you stay away all this time? How could you live with yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she implored in the smallest whisper. \u201cPlease don\u2019t . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t what? Call a spade a spade?\u201d He sneered.</p><p>\u201cRick,\u201d the woman, whom Bronwyn had forgotten about, spoke up. She kept her voice low, while she rocked the still-crying baby. \u201cTake it easy, for heaven\u2019s sake, she doesn\u2019t look well. What\u2019s going on here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course she doesn\u2019t look well,\u201d he scoffed, his harsh tone of voice totally unfamiliar. \u201cWhy would she look well when she has finally been caught, like the miserable little sneak that she is?\u201d</p> <p>Bronwyn swayed even more. Rick had never spoken to her like this before\u2014it wasn\u2019t in his gentle nature to be deliberately cruel\u2014but he was firing on all cylinders today, and Bronwyn flinched with each terrible barb.</p><p>\u201cRick.\u201d The woman was speaking again, but her voice sounded hollow, like it was coming from down a long tunnel. \u201cRick, stop it . . .\u201d She was saying something else but this time her voice had disappeared behind the angry buzzing in Bronwyn\u2019s head. She shook her head but the sound got worse and louder until it was as deafening as a chainsaw. She groaned weakly and lifted her hands to her ears. That didn\u2019t help, and she sobbed as her field of vision got narrower and narrower, until she could not see them at all, until there was only blackness.</p><p> Voices faded in and out of her consciousness and Bronwyn struggled to make sense of what they were saying. She was comfortable again, no longer dizzy and no longer achy. She felt like she was floating and was enveloped by an incredible sense of well-being. But this feeling was not quite right, and that awareness prevented her from being entirely at ease. She was sure that this uneasiness stemmed from the raised voices in the background, and again she attempted to filter out the garbled speech from the few words that she could understand.</p><p>\u201c. . . Don\u2019t get . . .\u201d it was a man\u2019s voice, recognizable and well loved but unfamiliarly harsh. \u201c. . . What she did . . . unforgivable . . . left him . . . bitch!\u201d An unfamiliar female voice intervened, her gentle voice soothed Bronwyn\u2019s overwrought nerves.</p><p>\u201c. . . Is she? What . . . she do . . . so bad?\u201d Bronwyn strained to open her eyes but it felt like a colossal effort.</p><p>\u201c. . . Deserted Bryce . . . needed her most . . .\u201d</p> <p>Bronwyn managed a weak gasp at that, outraged by this blatant lie. The couple went abruptly silent.</p><p>\u201c. . . Waking up,\u201d the woman said urgently. \u201c. . . The doctor! Now, Rick!\u201d</p><p>Doctor? Bronwyn frowned. Why a doctor? For the first time since regaining consciousness she wondered where she was and managed to drag her heavy lids apart with great effort. She stared up into the vaguely recognizable features of a pretty woman who seemed to be a couple of years younger than Bronwyn\u2019s twenty-eight. The woman\u2019s warm smile transformed her gentle features from plain to almost pretty and had the effect of immediately calming Bronwyn down.</p><p>\u201cTry not to panic,\u201d she instructed gently. \u201cYou passed out at work. At first we assumed it was shock but your fever and pallor soon made it pretty clear that you\u2019re seriously ill.\u201d Her sea-green eyes were grave behind the lenses of her trendy prescription eyeglasses, and her voice took on a chastising tone. \u201cYou should never have been at work in that condition. You should take better care of yourself.\u201d</p><p>Bronwyn frowned, wondering who the woman was, before deciding that being offended by her admonishment would require way too much of her strength. Clearly she was going to need that strength in the face of Rick\u2019s unexpected and unprecedented hostility. An alarming thought struck her, and she sat up in a blind panic, ignoring the sudden onslaught of dizziness.</p><p>\u201cPassed out at work?\u201d Her voice sounded weak, even to her own ears. \u201cOh no . . . I have to call my boss!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBronwyn.\u201d The woman placed gentle hands on her shoulders to push her back onto the cot, her lovely eyes brimming with sympathy. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that he wasn\u2019t very sympathetic about any of this. He said something about having had enough of your drama and that you shouldn\u2019t bother coming back. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d she moaned. \u201cNo, no. I needed that job!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell if you wanted to keep it, you shouldn\u2019t have gone to work in the condition you were in today, young lady.\u201d A stern voice intruded from the doorway, where a harried-looking older man in a white coat stood framed. \u201cAre you trying to kill yourself? You\u2019re just barely over a very bad bout of flu, possibly even pneumonia from what I can gather, and you were so dehydrated when they brought you in that I\u2019m amazed you didn\u2019t pass out sooner! The mere fact that you\u2019ve been out like a light for nearly five hours is proof of how close you are to relapsing. You\u2019re completely run-down.\u201d She went dramatically pale at that bit of news, and the doctor wrongly assumed that he had shocked her into taking her illness seriously. \u201cI would like to keep you overnight to monitor your condition.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d They were all taken aback by her sudden, shrill vehemence. \u201cNo, I can\u2019t stay here. I have to go home. I should be there right now. My shift would have ended an hour ago; I should be at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be stupid and downright dangerous in your condition, Mrs. Palmer,\u201d the doctor admonished, and Bronwyn\u2019s world reeled.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you call me?\u201d she asked in a shocked whisper.</p><p>\u201cHe called you Mrs. Palmer,\u201d Rick taunted from where he stood in the doorway with his arms folded across his broad chest. \u201cThat is still your name, isn\u2019t it?\u201d She stared at Richard Palmer helplessly, not knowing what to say and suddenly hating him with a ferocity that shook her.</p> <p>\u201cWell?\u201d he prompted sarcastically, and she nodded mutely, not understanding this hostility from someone who had always loved and respected her.</p><p>\u201cPlease . . .\u201d she whispered. \u201cPlease, Rick, I have to go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going home all right,\u201d Rick informed her coldly. \u201cJust as soon as it can be arranged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Palmer, I strongly advise against that,\u201d the doctor interjected firmly, but Rick ignored him, keeping his eyes on Bronwyn.</p><p>\u201cJust prescribe whatever medication she\u2019ll need, Doctor,\u201d he ordered in a manner that went completely against his usual easygoing nature. \u201cWe\u2019ll make sure that she gets plenty of rest.\u201d The doctor glared at them before shaking his head and leaving the room abruptly.</p> <p>\u201cRick, do you think this is a good idea?\u201d The other woman asked worriedly, and he raised his eyes to her anxious face before smiling gently, his expression now reminiscent of the Rick that Bronwyn knew and loved.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he murmured reassuringly, but the woman made an irritated sound and shook her head angrily.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had enough, Rick,\u201d she seethed, revealing claws beneath the sweet exterior. \u201cYou\u2019d better tell me what\u2019s going on and fast. I\u2019ve been sitting here for hours without getting a single straight answer from you, and I\u2019m fed up with it. Tell me what\u2019s going on, or I\u2019ll pack up and head off to Knysna on my own!\u201d Bronwyn watched in fascination as his eyes flared in panic and he lost all semblance of his previous icy coolness.</p><p>\u201cLisa,\u201d he choked. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t go off on your own when we just . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t test me,\u201d she warned. \u201cNow I think that it\u2019s past time you did some proper introductions and try to be civil, please.\u201d He frowned sullenly, looking about as menacing as a little boy with his hand caught in the biscuit tin.</p><p>\u201cLisa, meet Bronwyn Palmer. Bron, my wife, Lisa.\u201d Bronwyn\u2019s eyes lit up with genuine pleasure as her eyes flew from one face to the other. His wife? Well, then, that would explain the baby. She glanced around the room, looking for the child. She smiled when she saw the pram parked close to the window on the other side of the room and marveled at how much his life had changed in the last two years.</p> <p>\u201cYour wife? Ricky, you got married?\u201d He winced in response to her words.</p><p>\u201cBron, don\u2019t call me that,\u201d he muttered uncomfortably, sounding so much like his old self that Bronwyn\u2019s heart swelled with love for him. She smiled and turned her attention to the slender woman who stood beside him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad that he married someone like you,\u201d she managed weakly, wishing she could be more eloquent but suddenly feeling quite drained. She leaned back against the pillows and smiled up at them both. \u201cRicky deserves someone lovely . . .\u201d Her eyes drifted shut. \u201cI\u2019m so tired. Take me home. Please. I need to go home . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my brother\u2019s errant wife,\u201d she heard Rick telling his wife, but he sounded so far away that she frowned. Where was he going? \u201cAnd, as I said before, she\u2019s the heartless bitch who abandoned him when he needed her most!\u201d Her eyes flew open in horror, and she was shocked to find that he was closer than his distant voice had suggested. Confused, she tried to gather her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d she protested vehemently. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t. Why would you say something like that, Rick? Why would you lie?\u201d She heard the bewildered hurt in her voice and was ashamed to reveal how much his lies had wounded her. \u201cI thought we were friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur friendship ended when you did what you did to my brother,\u201d he snarled. She jumped when his voice caught up with him and the volume increased dramatically on the last word.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything to Bryce,\u201d she whimpered, her own voice still far away. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want me anymore . . . so I left. I left him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou left him for dead!\u201d</p> <p>The woman, Lisa, laid a restraining hand on Rick\u2019s arm as he made a frustrated move toward Bronwyn. Bron blinked at the fury on his face; she had no idea where all of this anger was coming from.</p><p>\u201cTake me home . . .\u201d she entreated again, keeping her eyes on the other woman\u2019s face. \u201cPlease. I have to go home . . .\u201d Just then an intimidatingly large figure suddenly loomed in the doorway, and when Bronwyn\u2019s eyes lifted, she was filled with a sense of impending doom.</p><p>He stood there. Quiet, graceful, and fierce, and Bronwyn cowered at the sight of him.</p><p>\u201cYou called him?\u201d she said, exhaling, the hurt and betrayal she felt evident in her voice and face. Despite everything, she had still steadfastly clung to the belief that Rick was her friend. She lifted her wounded doe eyes to his furious face. \u201cYou called him? Oh, Ricky, how could you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe called me because I\u2019m his brother and his loyalties lie with me.\u201d The beautiful dark voice was calmer than she would have expected and drifted over her like a gentle caress. She closed her eyes at the sound of that voice. It was the first time she had heard it in over two years, and God how she had missed it. She had hungered for the sound of his voice and had often thought of calling him just to hear it but had dismissed that impulse as a dangerous and forbidden luxury.</p><p>When she opened her eyes, she was shocked to find that he had moved. He was standing right beside her bed and much too close for comfort. She shifted somewhat, lowering her eyes to the bed covers, afraid to meet his glacial gaze. She was terrified of what she would see in those eyes and sneaked a peek at him from beneath her half-mast lids.</p><p>He was so big. She had forgotten that about him, forgotten the sheer bulk of this man who had once been her love and her life. He stood six feet four and had the brawn to match the height, huge shoulders, trim waist, and slim hips. He resembled a Norse god of old with the darkly golden hair and the grim features that looked carved from granite. The only hints of softness in that roughly hewn face were his long, long lashes and his beautifully shaped mouth. She had always wondered what a gorgeous, successful man like him had seen in a plain nobody like her. She was an awkward and gangly woman who had long legs, a skinny body, and the gracelessness of a giraffe. There was nothing remarkable about her, save that a man like Bryce Palmer had chosen her to be his wife, had seemed to love her and want her.</p><p>He looked older than his thirty-three years. He had obviously aged since she had last seen him, but it wasn\u2019t unflattering and it added even more character to an already strong face. Now he hovered over her like an avenging angel, beautiful and intimidating. He had all the power in the world to hurt her and\u2014according to him\u2014all the reason on Earth to hate her.</p> <p>\u201cLook at me!\u201d he hissed furiously. She lifted her head to meet his cold eyes head-on and quaked before the sheer, unadulterated hatred she saw there. \u201cYou took everything from me when you left. You stripped me of all dignity, left me bleeding by the roadside, and you never once looked back. I will never forgive you for that, Bronwyn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me to go,\u201d she defended herself weakly, looking down as she spoke, and was shocked when his huge hand reached out and grasped her fragile jaw. His grip was so unexpectedly fierce that she cringed a bit. She sensed Rick moving to intervene, but Bryce let her go abruptly.</p><p>\u201cLook at me when you talk to me,\u201d he gritted out savagely. \u201cYou did this to me. The least you can do is look at me when you have something to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBryce,\u201d she managed weakly, looking up at him, even though it terrified her to meet his eyes. \u201cYou told me to go. Remember?\u201d He made an impatient sound and turned his back on her. Bewildered, she stared at the broad expanse of his back and tried again, tears spilling from her eyes and her voice thickening with despair. \u201cYou didn\u2019t want me anymore. You said . . . I t-tricked you . . . said . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is my baby?\u201d He cut through her words coldly, spinning around to face her again, his eyes locked onto her tearful face with an intensity that unnerved her. She was aware of Rick making a shocked sound and Lisa quietly taking the stroller and leaving the room. \u201cWhere is the child you so cruelly deprived me of knowing?\u201d The tears streaming down her face did not move him at all, and his vicious gaze was unwavering.</p> <p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she whispered, and his eyes dropped to her mouth. \u201cPlease, Bryce . . . you said you didn\u2019t want a child . . . said I\u2019d tricked you. I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re being like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Bronwyn,\u201d he all but shouted, suddenly and quite spectacularly losing his cool. \u201cYou knew that I was angry! You knew that I would calm down eventually. But you chose to run out of there, chose to jump into your car when you weren\u2019t the best of drivers, and then you sped down that hill so fast that I was terrified you\u2019d kill yourself. You knew that I\u2019d follow . . .\u201d He gritted his teeth and tilted his head back, and she could see the muscles in his neck and throat work as he forced himself back under control. It took him longer than she would have expected. Bryce had always been quite adept at mastering his temper. Not this time, it seemed. While he managed to damp down the rage, she could still feel it simmering dangerously below the surface and it unsettled her. She didn\u2019t quite understand where all this anger was coming from.</p><p>\u201cWhere is my child?\u201d he growled dangerously, and Bronwyn\u2019s eyes flooded as she thought of her beautiful little girl. Kayla had every right to know her father and vice versa. It was just that, up until now, Bronwyn had had no clue that Bryce wanted to know his daughter. She thought of the two weeks she\u2019d spent at their holiday home in Knysna, waiting for him to come. Yes, she had known that he would need time to calm down and she had known that once he thought things through he would come for her. There had never been a doubt in her mind that he would want her and their baby.</p><p>But he hadn\u2019t come . . . he hadn\u2019t come to the most obvious place, the one place that she had been certain he would look, the place where they had spent so many happy hours together. And as the hours had turned into days and then into weeks, Bronwyn had been forced to face the reality of her situation: he had meant every cruel word. Bryce did not want their child, and as a consequence, he no longer wanted her. She would never have believed it of him, would never have expected him to abandon her to care for their baby on her own. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He had never once during their two-year-long marriage said that he loved her, but he had shown her in so many ways that she had believed that was enough. In the face of his abandonment, she had come to question that love and had been forced to acknowledge that the words would have meant more; the words would have meant everything. They would have set his love in stone.</p><p>Now he was standing here telling her that he had wanted Kayla after all? What was she supposed to believe? Why was he treating her like the villain for leaving, when he was the one who had driven her away? In the midst of her turmoil, she heard an unmistakable sound\u2014the familiar irrepressible chatter and giggle of a toddler . . . of a particular toddler. Bronwyn\u2019s panicked gaze swung to the open door and she was horrified to see the babysitter leading her beautiful daughter toward the room. Her anxious gaze swung toward Bryce but he seemed oblivious. He was watching her intently, still wanting an answer to his previous question. Rick had heard though and his gaze was riveted on the doorway as well. Oh God how could Katrina bring her here? How had the woman even known where to find Bronwyn?</p><p>\u201cAnswer me, damn you!\u201d Bryce was growling. How could he remain unaware of the approaching babble of an effervescent eighteen-month-old baby? He had his back to the door and so did not see when Kayla and the now-faltering Katrina crossed the threshold. The young woman hesitated as her gaze swept around the room, immediately picking up on the tension. The toddler had no such reservations and upon seeing her mother, her face lit up and she made a beeline for the cot. She was muttering incoherently under her breath, as was her wont, and her nappy-clad bottom waddled comically as she toddled her way toward Bronwyn. Bryce still seemed to have no idea that she was there, and as Kayla passed by the bemused Rick, barely sparing him a glance, she was suddenly confronted by an obstacle in the form of her tall father. She frowned up at the big man who had his back to her, looking so much like him in that moment that Bronwyn smiled.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you find so funny about this Bronwyn?\u201d he hissed.</p> <p>\u201cMan big,\u201d Kayla said, her first two clear words since entering the room, and it sounded more like criticism than compliment. When he still didn\u2019t get out of her way, she gave him a measuring look, drew back her leg, and . . .</p><p>\u201cKayla, no!\u201d Bronwyn shouted in horror, just as the little girl kicked her father on his calf. Bryce staggered a little, shocked rather than hurt, and whirled around, scanning the room desperately for a few seconds before dropping his gaze to the mutinous tiny girl before him. Not even knee-high to him and still in nappies, but she refused to back down.</p><p>\u201cKayla go . . .\u201d she stated like a queen, sweeping by her enthralled father. When she reached her destination, she stopped and stared up at her next obstacle with a fulminating glare. The bed was too high for her to climb on to, so the beautiful little imp with her mop of silky brown hair and her big ice-blue eyes swept beguilingly back to the tall man she had just slighted and undid him with a charming smile before lifting her arms demandingly.</p><p>\u201cUp, peese!\u201d she commanded with the air of one accustomed to getting her way. The \u201cplease\u201d was just a formality, and her father was helpless to do anything but obey. He picked her up reverently, holding her close for just an instant longer than she liked and she squirmed uncomfortably until he settled her onto the cot beside her mother, before shifting his piercing scrutiny to the babysitter whom he had only just noticed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Bronwyn,\u201d Katrina spoke uncertainly from the doorway, unnerved by Bryce\u2019s direct stare. \u201cWhen you were late I called the restaurant and they told me what had happened. I spoke to the doctor before bringing her here, and he said that you weren\u2019t contagious. I have a date . . . and I thought . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou thought that you\u2019d leave a little girl in hospital with her sick mother?\u201d Bryce completed incredulously.</p><p>\u201cWell . . .\u201d The woman looked uncomfortable, and Bryce veered his furious gaze back to Bronwyn, who had her forehead resting on Kayla\u2019s as she and her daughter communed without words. It was such a striking picture that he paused for an instant before launching an immediate attack.</p><p>\u201cThis is the type of irresponsible people you entrust our daughter\u2019s care to?\u201d Katrina\u2019s eyes widened at his revealing words, and Bryce turned to face the young woman again, ignoring the surprised expression on her face. \u201cThank you, miss. Your services will no longer be required. Rick, please give the young lady whatever money is owed to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can pay my own babysitter,\u201d Bronwyn hissed furiously, but he kept his back to her, ignoring her, while Rick led Katrina out of the room. He turned to face her, and she repeated her claim. \u201cI can pay my own babysitter, damn you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeeing that you have just lost your low-paying job, I don\u2019t think that you\u2019re in any position to be stubborn on this issue, Bronwyn.\u201d Kayla was glaring up at Bryce furiously, and her scowling little face immediately distracted him.</p><p>\u201cHey there, angel.\u201d His voice gentled as he crouched down beside the bed to meet her eyes. \u201cWhy so cross?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMummy sleep,\u201d she admonished. \u201cShhh!\u201d He blinked for a startled instant, before lifting his gaze to Bronwyn\u2019s shadowed eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt appears that our daughter has a lot more common sense than either of us does.\u201d He smiled fondly down at the toddler, who was lovingly stroking her mother\u2019s hair. \u201cYou\u2019re in no condition to argue, Bronwyn. Just do as I say.\u201d She gasped at his nerve and was about to protest when he hunkered down in front of Kayla again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHi, sweetheart, do you know who I am?\u201d His eyes were trained on Kayla\u2019s perfect little features; she was an enchanting combination of both parents. She had his eyes . . . blue eyes so pale that they sometimes looked almost gray.</p><p>\u201cMan,\u201d Kayla responded shyly before popping her thumb into her mouth and laying her head on her mother\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d He nodded. Rick reentered the room silently, and Kayla dragged her thumb out of her mouth long enough to point at him.</p><p>\u201cMan,\u201d she informed helpfully, and Bryce swiveled his head, caught sight of his brother, and nodded with a grin.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s your Uncle Rick.\u201d Rick looked startled to hear himself introduced as such, startled and then pleased. He seemed to swell with pride. \u201cI am your daddy . . . Can you say \u2018daddy\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d Bronwyn was so appalled by his blas\u00e9 introduction, that her voice came out louder than she had intended. It startled Kayla, who blinked in shock before melting into tears. Bryce looked devastated. He stared at the crying child helplessly, not knowing what to do. Bronwyn, unable to stop herself, continued furiously.</p><p>\u201cHow can you just announce it to her like that? How can you simply . . .\u201d Kayla cried even harder, and Bryce patted the child\u2019s head and cheek helplessly. \u201cStop ignoring me, damn you, I hate it when you do that!\u201d He looked up then, and when he saw her expression, his face darkened.</p><p>\u201cIt was you,\u201d he seethed. \u201cYou made her cry. I thought it was something I\u2019d done, damn you.\u201d Bronwyn blinked down at him in amazement before lifting her eyes to Rick\u2019s face in shocked realization.</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t hear me, can he?\u201d she asked Rick, who stood just behind Bryce. The younger man said nothing and merely continued to stare at her levelly. His silver-gray eyes were unnerving in their uncharacteristic iciness.</p> <p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask me that question?\u201d Bryce asked mockingly, and she returned her gaze to his face, realizing that he had heard her question. She berated herself for being ludicrous. Of course he could hear her. \u201cAh, but you already know the answer, don\u2019t you?\u201d he taunted and she stiffened, feeling like a fool. Kayla had stopped crying and had her head resting on Bronwyn\u2019s chest and her thumb back in her mouth. She was eyeing Bryce warily.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name, angel?\u201d he asked her gently. The child refused to answer and her eyelids grew heavier as she started to slip into a doze.</p><p>\u201cHer name\u2019s Mikayla,\u201d Bronwyn supplied, but he kept his eyes on Kayla\u2019s face, ignoring Bronwyn again.</p><p>\u201cGo on, tell me your name.\u201d He blatantly snubbed her. Kayla dragged her thumb out of her mouth and deigned to respond.</p><p>\u201cM\u2019kayla.\u201d She did not bother to lift her head and barely opened her eyes as she garbled her name the way she always did. It was recognizable enough, but Bryce was staring at the child with a baffled frown. He raised his confused eyes to Bronwyn, and she sighed before repeating the name.</p><p>\u201cMikayla, I named her Mikayla.\u201d The frown deepened and something uncomfortably close to loathing settled over his taut, handsome features.</p> <p>\u201cGoddamn you, Bronwyn,\u201d he growled, and she gasped. He didn\u2019t like the name? She had named Kayla after him\u2014his second name was Michael. Maybe he thought it was hypocritical of her to name their daughter after him when, as he now claimed, she had deprived him of his child. Bryce looked angry, hurt, and confused at the same time, and he kept glancing at his dozing little daughter and shutting his eyes despairingly. Bronwyn did not understand his reaction.</p><p>Rick stepped forward, leveling a resentful glare at Bronwyn that baffled her even further, before laying a calm hand on his agitated brother\u2019s shoulder. Bryce looked up and grabbed Rick\u2019s hand as if it were a lifeline.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he pleaded desperately, and Rick nodded.</p><p>\u201cHer name is Mikayla, Bryce,\u201d he told his brother gently, with both his mouth and his hands.</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>W-why are you doing that?\u201d Bronwyn stammered. Both men ignored her, and Bryce turned back to his sleeping daughter, with his heart in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cMikayla . . .\u201d he murmured, running a gentle finger down the baby\u2019s soft cheek. \u201cWhat a beautiful name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d Bronwyn asked in a voice bordering on hysteria, before convulsing into a series of painful coughs. Kayla stirred a little, disturbed by the violent coughing, and Bryce picked the little girl up and cradled her to his chest.</p> <p>\u201cGive me your flat keys. Rick and Lisa will pack your things.\u201d Her eyes were blurry with tears as the coughing tore at her throat and chest. She was unable to respond to the autocratic demand and was appalled when Bryce simply reached for her handbag and tossed it to Rick.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re probably in there,\u201d he told his brother. The younger man nodded and turned away.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Bronwyn called painfully, trying to get her coughing under control. Bryce handed her a glass of water that she gulped down thankfully. \u201cWhy were you using sign language?\u201d she asked urgently, her throat on the verge of giving out. Rick turned back with naked disgust on his face.</p><p>\u201cThis display of ignorance is an insult to our intelligence, Bronwyn!\u201d he hissed, and her eyes widened with hurt.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on here!\u201d Her voice was strained but she hoped she managed to convey her urgency. \u201cCan you hear me, Bryce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t heard much of anything over the last two years, Bronwyn.\u201d He shrugged scornfully. \u201cAnd you know it. You did this to me, after all.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMe?\u201d Bronwyn did not know what to react to first: the unbelievable news that her beautiful, strong husband was deaf, or the accusation that she was somehow responsible for his condition. It was all too awful to comprehend. \u201cBut . . . I . . . how?\u201d Rick made an impatient sound at the back of his throat, seemingly sickened by her continued ignorance. He touched his brother\u2019s arm to gain his attention. Bryce turned to face him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve asked that girl Katrina where she lives.\u201d He nodded toward Bronwyn, unable to even say her name. \u201cSome dump downtown. I\u2019ll pack a couple of bags for her and Mikayla.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPack only a change of clothes for the little one,\u201d Bryce ordered, his gaze softening as he looked down into his still-sleeping daughter\u2019s pretty face. \u201cIf the rags she\u2019s wearing right now are any indication, there won\u2019t be anything worth keeping. I\u2019ll clothe my own child.\u201d Bronwyn\u2019s eyes stung with tears at that terrible insult; if only he knew how much she had sacrificed and slaved for every single item of clothing the child possessed. She had worked double shifts, bypassed meals, and taken on extra jobs to keep her baby fed and clothed. They may not have been the most expensive clothes, but they were pretty and serviceable enough for an active toddler.</p><p>\u201cPack her toys though,\u201d he told Rick. \u201cGod knows they\u2019re probably not much better than the clothing, but she\u2019s bound to have her favorites.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean I did this to you?\u201d Bronwyn asked, letting the matter of Kayla\u2019s wardrobe slide in favor of a much more pressing matter. He didn\u2019t respond and she understood that he must have been lip-reading all along. She tugged at his sleeve to get his attention and he directed his arrogant gaze down to her pinched face.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean I did this to you?\u201d she repeated, and he frowned before turning away from her, deliberately blocking her out and making her feel about as significant as a fly.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you . . .\u201d She diverted her gaze to Rick when she saw that Bryce was ignoring her. A neat trick that, turning his back on someone when he didn\u2019t care to know what he or she was saying. It was certainly effective. \u201cWhat is he accusing me of?\u201d Rick couldn\u2019t ignore her as successfully as Bryce could, but he was definitely doing a good job of trying. He and Bryce were speaking quietly, sometimes lapsing into sign language and cutting her out completely. Feeling muddled, exhausted, and on the verge of hysterical tears, Bronwyn had no clear idea of how to deal with this problem. The situation had just spiraled completely beyond her control and she was too ill to deal with it. She watched as the talking men left the room and took her baby with them and she felt an overwhelming sense of dread. She wanted to snatch her child back and run as fast and as far as she could but all she could do was watch helplessly as the door swung shut behind them.</p><p>She covered her face with her hands, feeling as wrung out as a dishcloth. Hot tears seeped through the cracks of her fingers as she allowed herself to weep for everything that she had lost and was still losing. She was so wrapped up in her own misery that the first she knew of another presence in the room was a comforting arm around her narrow shoulders.</p><p>\u201cShhh, it\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay . . .\u201d Rick\u2019s pretty wife was perched on the side of the bed, her head bowed toward Bronwyn\u2019s. \u201cYou\u2019ll be all right, both you and your beautiful little girl will be absolutely fine. Bryce will take care of you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBryce hates me,\u201d Bronwyn negated miserably.</p><p>\u201cBryce could never hate the woman who has given him such a gorgeous daughter,\u201d the other woman denied.</p><p>\u201cHe blames me for what happened to him,\u201d Bronwyn groaned. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t even know what happened to him! How did he lose his hearing?\u201d She lifted her tear-drenched brown eyes to Lisa\u2019s face, and the other woman frowned, her expression thoughtful.</p><p>\u201cIt was an accident. Rick and I hadn\u2019t been dating for long\u2014barely a month since the day he first walked into my bookshop\u2014but we were serious enough that he was talking about introducing me to you guys.\u201d</p><p>So Rick had met Lisa while Bronwyn was still with Bryce. She remembered how euphoric and secretive he\u2019d been during those few weeks before she had left. She\u2019d even teased him about it over dinner one night and he\u2019d stammered and blushed like a schoolboy. The memory warmed her somewhat, but Lisa\u2019s sympathetic voice dragged her back into the horror of the present.</p><p>\u201cOne night Rick called me to cancel one of our dates because his brother had been in an accident. It was pretty bad. I met Bryce a few weeks later while he was still recovering in the hospital. Rick and I married about four months after the accident, when Bryce was well enough to attend. If I hadn\u2019t been two months pregnant at the time, we would have postponed the wedding. Both Rick and Bryce refused to talk about you again. I think Rick was merely following Bryce\u2019s lead on that score. He was so completely wrecked by what had happened to his brother that he would have walked over hot coals if he thought that it would make Bryce happy. From the rare bits of information about it that I managed to get out of Rick over the past twenty months of our marriage, I thought that you\u2019d opted out because you couldn\u2019t cope with his deafness.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t even know he was deaf until just now.\u201d She coughed painfully and Lisa stroked her hair soothingly.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you leave him?\u201d Lisa questioned gently.</p><p>\u201cI would never willingly have left him. I love him . . . loved him.\u201d Lisa raised her eyebrows at the telling slip and nodded. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know that now. I took one look at you this morning and I knew. So why did you leave him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he told me to leave. He kicked me out,\u201d Bronwyn recalled miserably. \u201cHe was unhappy about my pregnancy because we had agreed to wait a few years before starting a family. He accused me of getting pregnant deliberately, of tricking him. It was awful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d Lisa frowned. \u201cWhy would he go off the deep end like that? Surely a pregnancy is something to be celebrated?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Bronwyn confessed. \u201cI left to give him some time to cool off and went to our house in Knysna. I knew that once he had calmed down enough he would come looking for me. I never believed he wouldn\u2019t come . . .\u201d Her voice faded away as she remembered the pain, betrayal, and disillusionment she had felt when it became apparent that Bryce would not be coming for her.</p> <p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d Lisa asked sympathetically.</p><p>\u201cI waited. For two weeks I waited. Bryce is usually pretty good about keeping his temper under control, and when he does lose it he usually needs only a couple of hours for his logical thought processes to kick in again. But I\u2019d never seen him as angry as he was that night, so I figured that it would take him a little longer than usual to come to his senses.\u201d She shrugged helplessly, battling to keep the pain she still felt at the memory from showing. \u201cAfter a week, I tried calling him. But I was stonewalled. His staff had closed ranks around him. I couldn\u2019t reach him or Rick and I didn\u2019t know what to do. It felt as if my whole world had imploded.\u201d She bowed her head.</p><p>\u201cAfter the initial disbelief and pain, the anger and resentment kicked in. I decided that if he wanted nothing to do with the baby and me, then I wasn\u2019t going to make it easy for him to come crawling back. Not that I believed he would come back. I suppose I started thinking that way to preserve my pride. I went off the grid\u2014no credit, no bank accounts except the one I already had in my maiden name. The only jobs I was qualified to do didn\u2019t exactly keep stellar employee records. I never believed he would actually try to find us.\u201d She shook her head dazedly.</p><p>\u201cI thought he loved me.\u201d It shamed her to admit that now, embarrassed her to confess such a foolish belief in front of this woman who was so obviously confident in her husband\u2019s love. \u201cNow he blames me for his deafness, and he\u2019s practically accusing me of stealing Kayla from him when he had made it abundantly clear that he had no interest in her!\u201d She heard the bitterness creeping into her voice. \u201cHe undoubtedly thinks that the way we\u2019ve been living is beneath him, but I took good care of my baby. I fed her, clothed her, and loved her after he had abandoned us! How dare he waltz back into my life and presume that he\u2019d be the better parent just because he has so much more money than I do!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBryce has kept pretty much to himself in the time since I got married to Rick. He\u2019s a difficult man to get to know,\u201d Lisa said into the silence that ensued after Bronwyn ran out of steam. \u201cBut what I do know I like and respect. I can\u2019t really reconcile the picture you\u2019ve just painted with the man I\u2019ve come to know.\u201d</p> <p>Bronwyn nodded miserably. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she responded, forcing the words past her tortured throat. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to place you in an awkward position. I shouldn\u2019t have said those things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it at all,\u201d Lisa hurriedly corrected. \u201cIt\u2019s just that you each seem so convinced of the other\u2019s wrongdoing that there must have been some crossed wires somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Bronwyn tried to agree, but she was feeling fuzzy again, unable to concentrate.</p><p>\u201cTry to get some rest,\u201d Lisa suggested gently. \u201cYou look done in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t . . . would never . . .\u201d She could not complete the thought and was aware of nothing more as she slid into unconsciousness.</p><p>She looked fragile, like the slightest touch would break her, and how he wanted to break her. Bryce glared down at the stranger who was his wife and was eaten up by pure hatred for her. This innocent-looking bitch had destroyed his life and stolen his child. The barely contained violence he felt toward her had been festering for just over two years, and he quite cheerfully would have strangled her in her sleep if it weren\u2019t for the fact that their daughter needed her. He watched her labor to breathe and imagined that it sounded hoarse and ragged. He remembered sounds but sometimes wondered if his memory was accurate. For the longest time, despite his unsuccessful attempts to force it out, his most precious memory had been of her voice. Now the memory of the sweet, clear sound of her voice returned unbidden along with the bell-like clarity of her laugh and, lastly, how that lovely voice had sounded during their final argument, thick with tears and entreaties.</p> <p>She looked so ill. He grimaced, unwilling to feel any compassion for her. If she had worked herself into the ground it was less than she deserved for running out on him, for stealing his child, and for crippling him! He lived in a silent world now, the only sounds he heard were mere echoes of memories and her voice . . . always her voice.</p><p>He had hated her for haunting him, and he hated her still for looking so damned vulnerable, for being ill and weak and nearly defenseless, thereby rendering him impotent to lash out and rail at her the way he had fantasized about doing for so long.</p><p>Well, she wouldn\u2019t always be sick. He could wait. Revenge, they said, was a dish best served cold. He\u2019d been waiting for two years, so a few more weeks wouldn\u2019t make a difference. And how much sweeter the payback would be now that he had her very firmly within his grasp! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kayla decided that she didn\u2019t like scary and noisy helicopters and cried during the entire short, chartered flight from Plettenberg Bay to Camps Bay. Her beleaguered father, who was figuring out that parenthood may not be as fabulous as he had first imagined, battled to keep her calm while Bronwyn, who was feeling the effects of some pretty powerful medication, remained mostly oblivious to it all. Bronwyn was vaguely aware of Bryce frantically trying to shush the child. He made funny faces and played silly little games but Kayla refused to be comforted by someone who was a total stranger to her. She was too small to be belted in but she stubbornly refused to stay in Bryce\u2019s lap. Instead she kept trying to crawl over onto her mother\u2019s lap, and Bronwyn tried her best to soothe the little girl, but Kayla wasn\u2019t too impressed with her limp hugs either.</p><p>\u201cDo something,\u201d Bryce eventually entreated, when Kayla slid from his grasp like a greased pig and melted to the floor in a boneless heap. Once at their feet she wailed pitifully.</p><p>\u201cKayla scairt, mummy, Kayla scairt!\u201d she howled. Bronwyn, thoroughly fed up with the theatrics, reached down and dragged the limp toddler up with as much strength as she could muster.</p><p>\u201cMikayla,\u201d she managed hoarsely in her toughest, no-nonsense, voice. Kayla was momentarily silenced by Bronwyn\u2019s \u201cmummy\u201d voice and her wide blue eyes melted Bronwyn\u2019s heart. The poor little thing was understandably scared. Too many changes in too short a time for her. Bronwyn gentled her voice and smiled with what she hoped was cheerful confidence. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, baby. Sit with your daddy; he\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d Mikayla glanced over at the swiftly unraveling Bryce with wary speculation in her gaze. Turning to him for protection had evidently not occurred to her.</p> <p>\u201cMan?\u201d she questioned uncertainly.</p><p>\u201cDaddy,\u201d Bronwyn corrected tiredly, fading fast. \u201cGo and sit with him.\u201d The little girl, clutching her favorite stuffed doll to her chest, took the one small step separating her from Bryce and raised her arms to let it be known that she would allow him to pick her up now. Bryce lifted her into his lap and she curled up against his chest, propping her thumb into her mouth. Huge crocodile tears were streaming down her cheeks. Bronwyn rolled her eyes and leaned back with an exhausted sigh. For a couple of minutes everything was quiet, save for the noisy drone of the chopper. Bronwyn was just settling in for a doze when Bryce spoke, so softly that she could barely hear his voice above all the noise. Not even the headphones she was wearing helped to amplify his voice.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a handful.\u201d</p><p>Bronwyn opened her eyes and found herself staring straight into his brooding eyes. \u201cYes.\u201d She nodded tiredly. \u201cShe tends to be. But she\u2019s just frightened right now; this isn\u2019t anything that she\u2019s used to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about her,\u201d he invited, almost reluctantly. It obviously dented his pride having to ask her for anything.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s inherited more than just some of your physical traits,\u201d Bronwyn said with a smile. \u201cShe has a stubborn streak a mile wide and is ferociously independent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did she start walking and talking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was an early talker.\u201d Bronwyn\u2019s smile went misty. \u201cShe mostly gurgled a lot, babbled incoherently for a while . . .\u201d Bryce was frowning and she stuttered to a halt. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlow down,\u201d he commanded gruffly. \u201cI can\u2019t understand a damned thing you\u2019re saying!\u201d</p><p>Having momentarily forgotten about his deafness, the reminder served as a cruel reality check. She swallowed convulsively, aware of the dry, painful heat in her throat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered before repeating her previous statement as slowly and clearly as she could. Bryce rolled his eyes impatiently.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m deaf, not stupid,\u201d he ground out furiously. \u201cJust speak normally; don\u2019t babble and don\u2019t drawl and keep facing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d She helplessly repeated her apology. She felt hopelessly inadequate. Again, she tried to repeat her previous statement, but she was so nervous by now that she stammered badly. Bryce swore impatiently beneath his breath before deliberately lowering his gaze to Kayla. That easily he ended the conversation. The slight was brutally effective and left Bronwyn feeling thoroughly abandoned. She felt like a complete failure and kept her eyes trained on his face, hoping that he would look back up, but he was talking to the still-crying Kayla. He was so absorbed by his daughter that Bronwyn might as well not have been there.</p><p>She eventually lowered her gaze to where her hands were curled into tight fists in her lap, and as she desperately fought the urge to cry, she tried to figure out where and how her life had gone so very wrong. She thought back to their first meeting, which had always seemed like something out of a fairy tale to her\u2014Prince Charming meeting Cinderella while she was still in her rags but falling for her anyway.</p><p>It had seemed so perfect . . .</p><p>He had been, without a doubt, the most handsome man she had ever seen. It was her first day waitressing at the upscale beachfront restaurant in Camps Bay and she could not afford distractions, especially since she had lied about her qualifications to get the job. Fortunately she had managed to bluff her way through the in-house training without looking too incompetent. Since finishing high school six years ago, she hadn\u2019t been much good at anything except looking after her ailing grandmother, her only relative. It had been a full-time job, leaving no room in her life for the socializing other women her age enjoyed. Instead, she had spent most of her day in the company of an infirm old woman and any free time she may have had was devoted to her stash of books. It had been a sad and solitary existence for a young woman with such a sunny disposition but Bronwyn had never wished the task away. Her grandmother had raised her without complaint after her parents had died and Bronwyn had loved the old lady fiercely because of that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They had scraped by, living off her gran\u2019s pension and a small trust fund her grandfather had set up for his wife. After her grandmother\u2019s death just two months before, the balance of the fund had been spent on the funeral and Bronwyn had been forced to sell their small semi-detached house. Most of the money made from the sale had gone toward settling outstanding hospital bills, with barely enough left over for Bronwyn to pay the deposit on the tiny flat that she was now renting.</p><p>So here she was, trying desperately to do well at her new job, but she couldn\u2019t take her eyes off the man who had just walked into the restaurant. He was tall, blond, and beautiful, and he was absorbed in the conversation he was having with the lean, dark man beside him. The two men were as opposite as night and day. The blond was big and bulky, almost Nordic in appearance, while the dark one was lean and lithe, with a definite sexy Gallic look to him. They sat down at one of her tables and her mouth went dry. She hurried over, not wanting to keep such important-looking men waiting and thankfully stumbled only once along the way.</p><p>\u201cGood morning . . . Uh, hello . . . How may I . . .\u201d She blanked, having already stuffed up the perky greeting that had been drilled into her during training. The men were looking at her expectantly, and she faltered even more beneath the blond man\u2019s icy stare. \u201cYour order,\u201d she concluded abruptly. \u201cWhat is it, please?\u201d</p><p>The dark man\u2019s eyebrows climbed in astonishment, but the blond remained impassive even though Bronwyn, for a fleeting moment, thought that she spotted amusement flashing in those seemingly cold eyes of his.</p> <p>\u201cDrinks,\u201d she continued desperately. \u201cYou probably drink. So you probably want some, a lot, I mean . . .\u201d She felt her face going blood red with embarrassment. The dark man was staring at her in complete amazement, with his jaw dropped practically to his chest. The other man though, his jaw was clenched; he looked like he was exerting enormous control over his emotions. She panicked. He was probably angry, probably used to vastly superior service from this restaurant. She floundered again . . . at a complete loss.</p><p>\u201cYou look thirsty,\u201d she murmured, hoping to prompt them into saying something, anything. \u201cAnd we have plenty of drinks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you recommend?\u201d the blond asked unexpectedly. His voice was warm and mellifluous and much gentler than she had expected. It seemed completely at odds with the craggy planes of his face, as well as with his tightly controlled expression. His voice flowed over her like warm honey, and she stood staring at him dreamily without being aware of it for the longest time.</p><p>\u201cMiss?\u201d the dark man prompted impatiently. \u201cWhat do you recommend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh\u201d\u2014she snapped out of her daze, embarrassingly aware that she had been caught staring at the blond. \u201cRecommend?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDrinks,\u201d the blond reminded gently.</p><p>\u201cYes of course . . .\u201d She scanned her memory frantically. \u201cWine . . . we have wine, and of course we have . . . you might like it, because I quite like it, you see?\u201d They didn\u2019t seem to see. God, she was being such a socially awkward ditz. She wasn\u2019t usually this bad.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d the blond asked.</p><p>\u201cThe . . . um . . . the milkshake. Chocolate especially.\u201d The dark man\u2019s brows lowered in complete consternation; he really had the most expressive eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cYou recommend the . . .\u201d He sounded like he was choking, and his face was going an unbecoming shade of red. \u201cThe milkshake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even know they had milkshakes here,\u201d the blond said conversationally. \u201cDid you, Pierre?\u201d The other man, Pierre, seemed incapable of replying, and Bronwyn wished the ground would open up and swallow her, she was so humiliated. Milkshake? What was she thinking recommending the milkshake to a pair of men who had doubtless not had one since hitting puberty?</p> <p>\u201cWe have other\u2014\u201d she began miserably but was interrupted by Jake, the manager. Sensing a problem, he had come over to intervene.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, is everything all right here?\u201d he asked politely, sending a surreptitious glare toward the flustered Bronwyn. Bronwyn suspected that he knew she had lied about her previous experience, and it seemed that the owner had hired her against Jake\u2019s advice. Now Jake seemed desperate for her to mess up so that he could have an excuse to fire her. She hung her head and waited miserably for the men to complain. The darker one, Pierre, opened his mouth to say something, but the blond forestalled him.</p><p>\u201cNo problem at all,\u201d he murmured smoothly. \u201cMy colleague and I were just having some difficulty deciding what to order.\u201d Jake had no option but to retreat, but not before sending a warning glare toward Bronwyn.</p><p>\u201cVery well, Mr. Palmer.\u201d He practically genuflected as he stepped back. \u201cBut if you need anything, please ask for Jake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow why would we do that when we already have an excellent server right here?\u201d the blond, Mr. Palmer, asked smoothly before dismissing Jake with a casual flick of the hand. His colleague gaped at him in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cBryce . . .\u201d Pierre started to say. His name was Bryce! He ignored his friend and refocused his beautiful ice-blue eyes on Bronwyn\u2019s flushed face.</p><p>\u201cNow where were we?\u201d he asked mildly, his eyes running over her face intently. \u201cAh, yes . . . I think I\u2019ll have the chocolate milkshake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh . . .\u201d She gaped at him stupidly. \u201cUh . . . what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe milkshake, I\u2019ll have that. Chocolate of course.\u201d She nodded dazedly and scribbled down the order before reluctantly turning her attention to Pierre. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd for you, sir?\u201d Pierre was staring at his friend in disbelief, before refocusing his attention on Bronwyn. Those previously grim eyes of his were alight with humor.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell.\u201d He had a French accent. She had been so focused on Bryce that she hadn\u2019t noticed that before. \u201cI think I\u2019ll have that milkshake too!\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>A few hours after arriving in Camps Bay, Bronwyn was still unsettled by the emotions those long ago memories on the chopper had stirred up. She was standing in the conservatory; it was the highest point in the staggered house and had always felt like an eagle\u2019s aerie to her. All but one wall, as well as half of the ceiling, was entirely made of glass.</p> <p>She gazed down at the beautiful, blue Atlantic Ocean with its pristine beaches. To her left was a view of the mountain range, the Twelve Apostles, named after the majestic craggy peaks that loomed above the gorgeous beaches, while the bustling city of Cape Town lay to the right.</p><p>The house was exactly as she remembered. Big and beautiful, it was built into the face of the mountain and had panoramic views all around. Bronwyn loved this house, absolutely loved the way it caught the sun and loved the fact that it had always felt like home. It still did. She had felt it welcoming her back from the moment she had stepped off the chopper. Bryce had deserted her immediately after their arrival, taking Kayla to introduce her to her new home. Bronwyn had wandered around listlessly before finding herself back in this room\u2014her favorite. Bryce had always complained that she had turned it into a \u201cgirlie\u201d room, with comfortably overstuffed furniture, beautiful throw rugs, and anything else that caught her fancy. She had trawled flea markets and out-of-the-way little shops for anything she felt would suit this room, and the result had been an eclectic blend of old and new, a room for all seasons.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t changed it at all. Everything was still in exactly the same place as it had been when she had left, but the room felt unused, and Bronwyn knew that he hadn\u2019t set foot in it over the last two years. The room contained so many memories. They had spent hours in it, night and day; it was the room they had done most of their daily living in, simply talking, often making love, and then arguing fiercely on that last day.</p><p>Her eyes flooded with tears and she covered her face with her hands. Kayla had been conceived in this room too. One night, three months or so before their final argument, they had returned home from a party, both of them slightly tipsy. He had looked at her like she was the most beautiful woman in the world and had, indeed, told her that over and over again as he had worshipped her body on one of the rugs in front of the window. They had fallen asleep here, right where she was standing, entangled in each other\u2019s arms. They\u2019d been so close it had felt like nothing would ever separate them.</p><p>\u201cBronwyn.\u201d</p> <p>She jumped and swung around, so wrapped up in her memories that it took a few seconds for her to realize that he was no longer the same Bryce who had held her so tenderly that night. He had a sleeping Kayla draped against his chest and looked at a bit of a loss. She felt a combination of anger and regret at the sight of him holding her daughter and possessively reached out for her, but Bryce sent her a quelling look.</p><p>\u201cYou can barely stand upright. Do you really think you\u2019re capable of carrying her without dropping her?\u201d Frustrated by the logic of his words and biting back her protestations only out of concern for her daughter\u2019s safety, Bronwyn took a step back.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s past her usual nap time,\u201d she said, making certain that he was looking at her before she spoke, not wanting a repeat of the incident on the helicopter. \u201cWhere can we put her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a room prepared for her.\u201d He turned away and headed for the stairs, which led down to the second-story bedrooms. Bronwyn tensed when they passed the master bedroom and wondered where she would be expected to sleep. He led her to the room that adjoined the master and, with his hands full, he nodded toward the closed door. She obediently opened the door and then gasped when she saw the room. It was a nursery, beautifully decorated in lemon and cream. Toys of every kind were stacked neatly on shelves, and a crib\u2014gorgeously detailed and obviously for a newborn\u2014was positioned close to the large picture window. He carried Kayla to a bigger cot that Bronwyn hadn\u2019t immediately noticed. She watched as he tenderly laid his daughter down and covered her with a lightweight downy blanket. He stared at her for the longest time, his hand looking clumsy and huge and infinitely gentle as it stroked the little girl\u2019s silky hair.</p><p>\u201cWelcome home, Mikayla,\u201d he murmured gently before leaning down to place a sweet kiss on her forehead. He raised his head to meet her eyes, and seeing the question in them he shrugged, his face going a little bit red.</p><p>\u201cI had the room done a few months after you left. It was that or go stir-crazy. I didn\u2019t know if she was a boy or girl, so the colors had to be neutral. She has outgrown just about everything in here but I couldn\u2019t imagine . . . couldn\u2019t picture how she would look and didn\u2019t know how big she would be.\u201d His voice broke and he lowered his gaze to the sleeping toddler, his eyes glittering with unshed tears. \u201cGod, she\u2019s so beautiful.\u201d</p> <p>Bronwyn didn\u2019t know what to say, didn\u2019t know how to respond to this obvious desire he\u2019d had to be a part of his child\u2019s life. Why hadn\u2019t he come for her if he\u2019d wanted the baby? Why hadn\u2019t he taken, or returned, any of her calls? At the same time she couldn\u2019t help but feel near hatred toward this clearly conflicted man. He had robbed them of the opportunity to be a real family with his inexplicably cruel actions, and pretty little rooms with expensive toys weren\u2019t going to change that fact. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBryce.\u201d She tugged on his sleeve to get his attention. She wouldn\u2019t be swayed by the obvious vulnerability on his face. \u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of cruel games you\u2019re playing with me. You tossed us away like so much garbage. If you wanted us you would never have done that. I\u2019m sorry that you missed out on the first year and a half of your daughter\u2019s life, but you do know that you have only yourself to blame for that, right?\u201d She watched the barb hit home as he flinched at her words. The vulnerability fled from his face to be replaced by fury.</p><p>\u201cYou should get some rest.\u201d His words were icy. \u201cYou look exhausted and ill! You\u2019re also much too thin. Mikayla needs a healthy mother, not some wraith who can barely lift her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBryce . . . I don\u2019t understand. Why do you hate me so much. What have I done to deserve this ridiculous amount of contempt?\u201d It was getting increasingly hard for her to remain upright, but this was important. She was physically weak at the moment, but she was not going to let him walk all over her.</p><p>\u201cHow dare you ask me that?\u201d he hissed furiously. \u201cHow dare you, after everything that you\u2019ve done?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did what you told me to do,\u201d she reminded him, her trembling voice as icy as his had been before. \u201cYou told me to leave, to get out of your sight! You called me a deceitful, lying bitch and told me that you never wanted to see me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust stop playing the tragic victim,\u201d he warned. \u201cThe only reason I can stomach having you back in my life is because of Mikayla, but push me too far and I\u2019ll make damned sure you never set eyes on her again.\u201d</p><p>His threat\u2014her worst fear\u2014sent a shiver down her spine, and her throat closed up, shutting her up as effectively as a punch to the jaw would have. Their eyes clashed for a moment, his stormy and furious, hers bleak with terror. Bryce muttered something vile sounding beneath his breath before taking an unexpected step toward her and folding her into his strong arms. His head swooped and he caught her lips in a fiercely tender kiss. Bronwyn gasped in shock, fear, and relief. This felt more like home than the house had. She burrowed closer, wanting the intimacy and affection that she had been missing for so long. Her head tilted back and her mouth opened like a flower beneath his. He groaned, one large hand flat against the small of her back, the other cupping the back of her head. There was an edge of desperation to his kiss, a hunger that had never been present in his lazy, long kisses of the past. His tongue sought and found hers; she felt weak and dizzy with desire. God she had missed him so much, enough to allow this moment of weakness, even though she knew it wouldn\u2019t solve any of their problems. His hands crept up to cup her face, and his thumbs swept over the silky skin of her cheeks. She had her arms wrapped around his hard, warm body, and her hands splayed against his back. She would have crept into his skin if she could.</p><p>He stiffened suddenly before tossing her aside with a vicious curse and glaring down into her dazed face contemptuously. He shook his head grimly before turning on his heel and striding out without another word, leaving her hurt, humiliated, and furious in his wake. Bronwyn wrapped her arms around her shaking body, still utterly devastated by how much he seemed to despise her. There was a time when he had seemed like a dream come true. He had been an enigma but still the most intriguing man she had ever met . . .</p><p>He had kept watching her and making her jumpier than she already was. After slurping down his milkshake with every appearance of complete enjoyment, he had asked her for a meal recommendation, but after the disaster with the drinks, she politely informed him that she highly recommended everything on the menu. He wasn\u2019t having that, and, ignoring his impatient friend, he forced her to tell him what her favorite dish on the menu was. She hadn\u2019t worked at the restaurant long enough to sample much of the menu and very reluctantly revealed her plebeian tastes by saying that she enjoyed the gourmet brie and bacon burger that they offered. He nodded and ordered said burger. His friend, done with indulging him, ordered something much more in keeping with his sophisticated palate. Bryce went through the same routine with dessert, and Pierre, evidently giving up on him, made his excuses and headed back to whatever glamorous life he led. Bryce remained though, eating his dessert and following it up with coffee. He remained for four hours, the last hour of which had been spent sitting solo at the table toying with dessert, ordering cup after cup of coffee and staring at her. He never smiled and never flirted; he simply watched her. Eventually he asked for the bill and when she brought it, he graced her with the slightest of smiles, his serious eyes warm and a bit confused.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never done this before have you?\u201d he asked gently, as if afraid of hurting her feelings, and she flushed painfully before nodding.</p><p>\u201cWhat gave it away?\u201d she joked, feeling like a miserable failure.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He shrugged, his smile widening. \u201cMaybe the way you kept recommending the least expensive items on the menu, despite the fact that it would probably decrease your tip.\u201d She was appalled for not realizing that herself and made a mental note to recommend the lobster to every client who asked in the future! She frowned, forcing herself to remember to write that down before giving up and drawing a Post-it booklet from her apron pocket to jot down in capital letters: REMEMBER LOBSTERS!!! He was watching her every reaction in complete fascination, and she looked up to find him staring at her again.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you keep watching me like that?\u201d she asked bluntly, before going even redder, shocked by her own forwardness. His brows lowered as he gave her question some consideration. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t aware that I was being so . . . obvious,\u201d he murmured. He shook himself out of some kind of reverie before reaching for his wallet and extracting a platinum credit card. It was pretty clear that he had no intention of answering her question. He was a generous, but not overly generous, tipper, and when she returned with his credit card he stood up while pocketing his wallet.</p><p>\u201cThank you . . . Bronwyn, is it?\u201d She nodded mutely and he smiled\u2014just the barest tilt at the corners of his mouth\u2014again. \u201cThe name suits you.\u201d She didn\u2019t respond to that, not sure if it was a compliment or not.</p><p>He turned to go and then hesitated before turning back to face her.</p><p>\u201cHow old are you, Bronwyn?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTwenty-four.\u201d</p><p>His expression was inscrutable.</p><p>\u201cYou seem younger.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m twenty-nine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d Why was he telling her this? He was a strange man, but not in a scary way. He seemed so sophisticated, so unlike anyone else she had ever met.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s just that . . .\u201d He seemed to lose track of what he was saying and stood, awkwardly silent for a few seconds. \u201cYou just . . . you have . . .\u201d What? She had what? She ran her tongue over her teeth, afraid that she may have something stuck in them, and then rubbed her nose in case she had a spot on it.</p> <p>\u201cSuch amazing eyes,\u201d he concluded in a rush.</p><p>Huh?</p><p>She gaped at him uncomprehendingly for a while, and he went dull-red before clearing his throat and turning away abruptly. He left before she could blink, before she could draw breath, and before she could call him back.</p><p>It had been nearly a week since their ill-fated kiss and Bryce hadn\u2019t spoken to her much since then. He had given her the master bedroom and as with the conservatory, the room had an unlived feel to it. Her wardrobe had been left untouched, but Bryce\u2019s clothes were gone; not a tie or even a stray cuff link remained. It was as if he had never shared the same closet space with her. None of her old clothes fit her anymore; they were all a couple of sizes too large. Bronwyn had been dismayed to discover exactly how much weight she had lost over the last couple of years. She had always been slender, so the fact that she had dropped two dress sizes must mean that she looked completely emaciated! No wonder Bryce had said that she looked like a wraith.</p><p>She made a concerted effort to eat more, and as Kayla was spending a lot of time with her father, Bronwyn was getting plenty of rest, so much rest that she was getting quite bored. She was sitting in the conservatory, reading an easy (or so the back blurb claimed) guide to South African Sign Language, when she heard Kayla\u2019s happy chatter approaching. She tucked the book behind a cushion, not wanting Bryce to know she was trying to learn SASL. Something told her that he would not be happy about it. Any references she had made to his deafness were not well received.</p><p>Kayla entered the room in her inimitable way, all happy laughter and incomprehensible speech while Bryce followed her in his inimitable way, all scowls and growls when he saw that Bronwyn occupied the conservatory.</p> <p>\u201cMummeeeee!\u201d The little girl squealed when she saw Bronwyn, and she clambered into her mother\u2019s lap, smelling of sunshine and sea air. She was wearing cute pink dungarees, one of the very many expensive items of clothing her father had purchased for her. He had taken his daughter out shopping, without Bronwyn, the day after their arrival in Camps Bay. He had sent the housekeeper to ask for Kayla\u2019s sizes. Bronwyn had felt rather awkward around Celeste, the housekeeper, who had been with them since their wedding just over four years ago, but the elderly woman had welcomed her back with a genuinely warm smile. Bronwyn had written the sizes down and mentally wished him luck with Kayla, who inevitably became a nightmare to handle in any shopping situation. No sooner had they left, than she started worrying about both of them. Bryce might find Kayla more than a handful with his deafness, and Kayla would probably start panicking when she figured out that her mummy was nowhere to be found. Her worrying had come to nothing though, because the two had returned from their shopping spree fast friends and totally inseparable from that point onward. She was a little jealous and resentful at the ease with which Bryce had established a position in her daughter\u2019s life. A petty part of her had hoped that Kayla would give him a hard time of it, but her daughter had accepted him without protest and seemed to barely miss Bron at all.</p><p>Despite her deep-seated feelings of animosity toward Bryce, Bronwyn tried very hard not to begrudge them this time together, if only for Kayla\u2019s sake. The little girl needed Bryce in her life. And Bronwyn had to acknowledge that the toddler, with her boundless energy, would have sapped her last reserves. Now she cuddled the affectionate child lovingly, delaying the moment when she would actually have to look at her grim husband. When she managed to summon up the guts to glance at him, she was surprised by an expression of unguarded vulnerability on his face. The expression was quickly shuttered when he noticed that she was staring at him, and the habitual frown took its place.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you and Daddy do this morning?\u201d she asked Kayla, keeping her eyes trained on his face so that he would not feel excluded.</p><p>\u201cWe play horsy . . . giddup.\u201d The child chortled in remembered glee. She bounced on her mother\u2019s lap, and Bronwyn winced as Kayla\u2019s shoes dug into her thighs. \u201cGiddup mummy . . . giddup, giddup!\u201d Bryce plucked the child from Bronwyn\u2019s lap before she could do any damage.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hurting your mummy,\u201d he told the child in his carefully modulated voice. He spoke very quietly, and Bronwyn guessed that he had difficulty judging the volume of his voice. He kept it so soft that she strained to hear him sometimes. Not that anything he said was ever directed at her. She guessed that the volume of his voice would grow in proportion to his anger, and he was perpetually angry with her. He stared at her thoughtfully for a little while before totally shocking her and sitting down next to her, putting Kayla down to play with the toys that were scattered all over the floor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou look much better,\u201d he observed, his eyes continuing to run over her face and form. \u201cNot as gaunt, and you\u2019re getting some color in your cheeks. How do you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter.\u201d She nodded. \u201cBored.\u201d He shocked her by gracing her with the smallest of smiles.</p><p>\u201cYes, you were never one for long periods of inactivity.\u201d He nodded. \u201cHave you given any thought to what you want to do once you\u2019ve recovered?\u201d She stared at him in dismay, having no clue how to answer that question. She hadn\u2019t dared think about the future; she had no idea what Bryce wanted from her. Did he expect them to just continue to live together in the same soulless fashion for the next fifty years or so? Because Bronwyn couldn\u2019t do that. She absolutely refused to live like this for much longer; she would rather get a divorce. Did he want a divorce? For that matter, were they divorced already? She was certain of only two things; he wanted his daughter but he did not want Bronwyn.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t . . . what do you mean?\u201d</p> <p>He frowned. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a trick question, Bronwyn,\u201d he responded scathingly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure . . . I suppose I\u2019ll find a place to live?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t like her response. That much was evident from the way he was glowering at her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not taking Kayla away from me again, Bronwyn. You\u2019ll both be staying here. You\u2019d best reconcile yourself to that fact!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStaying here as what?\u201d she asked pointedly. A divorce was looking increasingly appealing right now. She had no idea why she hadn\u2019t instigated proceedings herself long ago. She supposed she had clung to the remnants of a fairy-tale marriage that had never existed outside of her imagination.</p> <p>\u201cMy wife and my daughter,\u201d he responded angrily, his voice rising marginally. \u201cI could do without the wife, but I realize that it\u2019s a package deal for now, so I\u2019m willing to suffer your presence in my life again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long do you expect us to continue to living like this?\u201d she pressed. She was trying very hard to keep the emotional strain off her face.</p><p>\u201cLive like what? You have it made, Bronwyn, you\u2019ll never want for anything, you have everything you need right here. I\u2019m the one who will be making the sacrifices, shackled to the wife who crippled me and stole my child from me. I\u2019ll be the one saddled with a wife whom I have absolutely no respect for. But I want my daughter, and for now this is the only way that I can have her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh please, Bryce,\u201d she retorted, her face pale with anger and hurt. \u201cYou\u2019re not quite the prize you think you are. You forget that I\u2019ll be trapped in a loveless marriage with a man who kicked me out of the house when I told him I was pregnant with his child. A man who hates me for absolutely no reason at all and who makes no secret of the fact that he doesn\u2019t respect me. How on earth do you call that having it made? I\u2019d rather we divorce and try to reach an amicable custody agreement. Kayla and I could live close by and . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only other option you have here is if I took her from you, Bronwyn. No compromises. You live here with us, or you leave without her. What\u2019s it to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t take her from me . . .\u201d she began helplessly, going ice cold as he pulled the rug out from under her again. Damn him, he held all the cards and he knew it. Her bravado was just empty posturing. She didn\u2019t have his resources, and for now she\u2019d have to toe his line until she could find a way out of this mess.</p> <p>\u201cCan\u2019t I?\u201d he asked frostily. She floundered beneath his steady gaze, lowering her eyes to where Kayla was happily playing on the floor. \u201cYou\u2019d better start thinking about what you want, Bronwyn. Stay or leave. But if you stay, I suggest you start finding ways to make your life here more tolerable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about . . .\u201d she began before biting her tongue and blushing to her toes. The blush gave her away.</p><p>\u201cSex?\u201d he prompted, and she nodded miserably. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know about yours but my sex life is perfectly fine.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cNaturally, I don\u2019t expect you to deprive yourself either. If you\u2019re concerned that I\u2019ll come creeping into your bed one desperate night, don\u2019t worry about it. You\u2019re the last woman in the world I want to sleep with.\u201d His expression was filled with such distaste that Bronwyn\u2019s eyes filled with tears of shame. She knuckled them away, infuriated by the display of weakness. His contempt hurt more than she could possibly have imagined. She glanced down at their daughter. The innocently playing little girl remained oblivious to the tension in the room, and Bronwyn was grateful for that. She refocused her attention on Bryce.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted me the other day,\u201d she reminded him defiantly, and he laughed.</p><p>\u201cI felt sorry for you,\u201d he corrected. \u201cTrust me, Bronwyn, the mere thought of touching you makes my skin crawl!\u201d She flinched and struggled desperately to keep her tears at bay and her emotions in check, but one single scalding drop escaped to scorch its way down her cheek. His eyes followed the tear\u2019s progress. His jaw clenched, and his expression remained emotionless. He looked like a man under enormous strain. She wiped at the moisture on her face, wanting to be as unemotional as he was but failing dismally when another tear escaped. She averted her face, not wanting to see the scorn in his eyes and pushed herself up as she sought an escape route out of the room. He got up too and stood in front of her, blocking her way to the exit, so she turned away from him and walked to one of the windows, staring blindly out at the magnificent scenery as she fought to control her emotions. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He watched her narrow back quiver as she bravely tried to bring herself back under control. Damn her! Her tears had always had the power to unman him, but that was something she did not know, something he had never dared reveal to her for fear that she would use them as a weapon against him. But he could tell that Bronwyn hated having him see her tears. He could see her struggling to be strong, but she was so transparent that every devastating emotion showed clearly on her face. The very fact that she was trying so hard to hide any sign of weakness from him made her tears difficult to ignore. He clenched his fists and forced himself to remain where he was, not to give in to the temptation to go and comfort her.</p><p>She looked out at the ocean but didn\u2019t appear to be admiring the view as she wrapped her slender arms around herself. She seemed so incredibly lonely that it almost physically hurt him not to go to her. But Bryce refused to fall into her trap again; he was calling the shots now. The last time he had been so smitten with her that he had barely been able to see straight. He remembered the first time he\u2019d laid eyes on her, how he had stared at her that day, trying to figure out what he found so fascinating about her.</p><p>She was tall, about five eleven, but she lacked the grace inherent in a lot of tall women. In fact, on that first day, she had seemed to fall over her feet just about every five minutes. She wasn\u2019t even pretty. Her features taken separately were attractive enough, a long straight nose, lush mouth, high arching eyebrows, and the most beautiful, thickly lashed, brown eyes that he had ever seen. Yet when put together in her narrow, oval face, those features just didn\u2019t seem to match. Still he had been compelled to stare for hours, drowning every time she shifted those huge, velvet-brown doe eyes of hers to him.</p><p>Now he watched her warily, almost wishing that he had never laid eyes on the treacherous bitch. He damned her for looking like a fragile waif with her badly trimmed dark-brown hair curling around her face where it had escaped from its sloppy ponytail. He watched as she straightened her back, coming to some sort of resolution, and turned back to face him. She walked toward him until they were separated by less than a meter.</p> <p>\u201cI will stay,\u201d she said, her beautiful mouth forming the words concisely. It was hell, this lip-reading business. Every time his gaze fell on her full lips, he found himself remembering what they tasted like. \u201cIt looks like I have no other choice. When I have completely recuperated and Kayla is settled in, I want to resume my studies.\u201d He nodded; one of his objections to her pregnancy had been that she was in the process of obtaining her undergraduate degree in zoology, her ultimate goal to become a veterinarian. He hadn\u2019t been comfortable with the idea of her giving that up and maybe one day resenting both him and the baby for having to sacrifice her dreams. He couldn\u2019t recall telling her that at the time though but he knew that he hadn\u2019t been at his most logical after hearing the news that she was pregnant.</p><p>\u201cIf this is to be an open marriage,\u201d she continued, \u201cI will start seeing other people too. All I ask is that we be as discreet as possible, for Kayla\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>She intended to see other men? That thought did not sit too well with him, and he opened his mouth to protest before remembering that it had been his own stupid idea for her not to deprive herself. After all if he did not want her, why should she not feel free to find someone who would? Some other guy who would hold her and kiss her? Someone who would be free to wipe away her tears and comfort her? Some other man who would love her and take care of her? Someone who would do what Bryce no longer wanted to do? He nodded, hoping that none of the confusion he was feeling was evident in his eyes or on his face.</p><p>\u201cSounds fair,\u201d he agreed smoothly before dropping his gaze pointedly to her bare ring finger. \u201cBut open marriage or not, you have to start wearing your wedding rings again.\u201d</p><p>Bronwyn covered her left hand self-consciously with her right, her own eyes dropping to his strong hands. She had noticed, couldn\u2019t help but notice, that he still wore his wedding ring, a broad brushed gold and platinum band with a complex Celtic design that had matched her much smaller band.</p> <p>\u201cI . . . I don\u2019t have them,\u201d she confessed, and he made an impatient sound at the back of his throat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m deaf, remember?\u201d he prompted sarcastically. \u201cShow me your mouth when you speak!\u201d She raised her face and met his gaze unflinchingly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have the rings?\u201d he asked in disbelief. \u201cWhat the hell did you do with them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sold them,\u201d she said before fleeing from the room, not wanting to see his reaction to that confession. She would have given anything to hold on to those rings even though they had come to symbolize nothing but lies.</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p> <p>Bronwyn hadn\u2019t really expected to see the handsome Mr. Palmer again after that disastrous first time, yet there he was, waiting outside the restaurant the following evening after her shift ended. He had looked moody and uncertain, leaning against the wall outside the staff entrance. When she saw him, she hesitated, not sure why he was there.</p><p>\u201cOh . . . sir, are you waiting for someone? Would you like me to deliver a message?\u201d He was frowning down at her in consternation and seemed a little bewildered.</p><p>\u201cHave you eaten?\u201d he asked unexpectedly, and her brow wrinkled as she tried to make sense of the bizarre situation.</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cHave dinner with me?\u201d The request was so abrupt that it took a few seconds to sink in.</p><p>\u201cUh . . .\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLook, I know how this must seem,\u201d he acknowledged gruffly. \u201cBut I assure you, I am not in the habit of lurking around outside restaurants and ambushing the female staff with invitations to dinner. I won\u2019t harm you in any way. I\u2019m not some creepy pervert or anything. I just . . . I just . . .\u201d</p><p>She waited, watching in absolute fascination as he glowered in frustration and ran an agitated hand through his hair while swearing beneath his breath. He dropped his gaze to the ground as he made a visible effort to gather his scattered wits.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d he was muttering to himself. \u201cI sound like a complete psychopath . . .\u201d Her lips curved into a slight smile at the tone of disgusted self-discovery, but she quickly wiped it from her face when he shifted his eyes back to her.</p><p>\u201cI had no intention of coming back, but I wanted to see you again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He sounded so baffled that the smile crept back into her eyes. \u201cWill you have dinner with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said lightly, and his frown deepened. He nodded, pushing himself away from the wall and turning to lead the way before pausing to turn back to her.</p><p>\u201cDo you have absolutely no sense of self-preservation?\u201d he growled, and her eyebrows shot up in surprise at his stern tone. \u201cPromise me that after tonight you won\u2019t agree to have dinner with any more strange men off the street! It\u2019s dangerous. There are all manner of crazies out there. Murderers and rapists and God knows what else. You have to be more careful, Bronwyn. Promise me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise,\u201d she vowed, a little stunned by this unexpected protectiveness from a man she barely knew.</p> <p>He had smiled in relief and she noticed, for the first time, that he had a rather sexy dimple in his right cheek. \u201cGood. Then let\u2019s eat . . .\u201d</p><p>Bryce had been in an unpredictable mood since she had confessed, earlier that day, to pawning her wedding and engagement rings. Bronwyn eyed her husband nervously across the dinner table. They tended to have late dinners, so Kayla had been fed and put to bed an hour before. She had toyed with the idea of skipping dinner, but she knew that it would be foolish to miss any meals when she was already so weak, and eating in her room would be the coward\u2019s way out. Bryce had insisted, soon after her arrival, that they dine together. He seemed to want everyone to think that this was some kind of happy reconciliation. Not that anyone other than the maids had been around to see them together. Rick, Lisa, and their thirteen-month-old baby\u2014Rhys\u2014had resumed their family vacation in Knysna and wouldn\u2019t be back in Cape Town for another few days.</p><p>Bronwyn was still amazed by how much things had changed since she left. She wondered where Bryce\u2019s friends were. Pierre De Coursey, his business partner at DCP Jewellers Inc. and good friend, used to be a regular visitor in their home; she had liked the Frenchman, although she knew he must have wondered what Bryce was doing with a small-town hick like her.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Pierre?\u201d She got sick of the silence and decided to take the bull by the horns. When she received no response, she looked up to find Bryce contemplating his wineglass. She sighed sadly, immediately realizing her mistake. She waved to catch his attention and he looked up absently. She repeated her question and he frowned.</p><p>\u201cYou want beer?\u201d he asked in surprise.</p><p>\u201cPierre De Coursey?\u201d She used the Frenchman\u2019s full name, hoping that it would help, and watched as Bryce\u2019s lips quirked in amusement, causing his dimple to wink briefly. She was a little shocked at the self-deprecating humor she saw in his eyes.</p> <p>\u201cSorry, b\u2019s and p\u2019s, you know? Along with v\u2019s and f\u2019s and t\u2019s and d\u2019s. It can be a little confusing when there\u2019s no context to a comment or conversation. I can get a little lost.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and dared a slight smile. \u201cWhat about Pierre?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell he hasn\u2019t been around at all since my return. I find this rather strange, since he used to come by most evenings before . . . before . . .\u201d Her voice petered off, and his eyebrows rose.</p><p>\u201cBefore you ran away?\u201d he inserted smoothly.</p><p>\u201cBefore I was driven away,\u201d she corrected, just as smoothly, fed up with being the villain of the piece. His eyebrows raised a notch higher, but he let it slide for once.</p><p>\u201cPierre spends most evenings at home with his family these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis family?\u201d Pierre hadn\u2019t been married when she left.</p><p>\u201cYes, he has a wife and son.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPierre De Coursey got married?\u201d She couldn\u2019t quite keep the shock out of her expression.</p><p>\u201cCame as a surprise to me too.\u201d He grinned unexpectedly and looked so much like his old self that Bronwyn\u2019s mouth went dry with longing. \u201cLast year, nearly a full year after you\u2019d left, he quite unexpectedly announced that he was getting married. Admittedly, I had been very much out of commission and not too aware of what was happening in the world around me at the time, but Pierre, who had been a regular and concerned visitor and friend had never even mentioned meeting a woman he was serious enough about to marry.\u201d</p><p>Bronwyn was so busy absorbing the rare and revealing statement about his convalescence after the accident that his comments about Pierre barely registered. To all intents and purposes, it seemed as if Bryce had retreated from the world after his accident and hadn\u2019t ventured back into it. He seemed almost reclusive and hardly ever left the house. In fact she could not recall him going to the office once since her return. He and Pierre co-owned an exclusive jewelry company that was renowned for its designer accessories that catered to only the wealthiest members in the most rarefied reaches of society. The company had branches in all the major cities in Europe, North America, and Asia and had just recently gone public on the stock exchange. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAlice is fantastic,\u201d he was saying. \u201cJust what Pierre needs.\u201d Sidetracked by that, Bronwyn frowned and tuned back in to the conversation.</p><p>\u201cPierre De Coursey married a woman named Alice?\u201d Somehow she had always pictured Pierre, when she had even entertained such an absurd notion, as ending up with a woman exotic in both name and looks.</p><p>\u201cYes. She\u2019s a nice woman, a bit quiet but sharp as the proverbial tack,\u201d he recalled fondly, and Bronwyn forced back a tide of envy at the warmth in his voice.</p><p>\u201cHow did they meet?\u201d she asked, curious.</p> <p>\u201cHospital. Pierre was visiting me and wandered into the wrong ward. Alice had been in an accident too, a really bad one from what I understood. She was unconscious, apparently in a coma, and while every other patient in the room had cards and flowers, Alice had nothing. I don\u2019t know, I think Pierre felt a little sorry for her, so he checked in on her every day on his way to visit me and soon learned that she had no family and that she had just moved here from Johannesburg, which meant that she\u2019d had no time to befriend anyone yet. He kept visiting her even after my discharge from the hospital. He brought her flowers and talked to her for months until one day she opened her eyes, smiled, and said, \u2018It\u2019s you.\u2019\u201d Bryce shrugged. \u201cDamned if I know what that meant, but Pierre fell hard and fast. They married a couple of months later, after Alice had convalesced enough to walk down the aisle without aid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, what a beautiful story.\u201d Bronwyn smiled mistily and Bryce rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cHow like a woman to find it romantic,\u201d he scoffed.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think it\u2019s romantic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that Pierre just liked feeling needed and enjoyed the idea of having someone almost totally dependent on him. It happens! The love may have come later but initially, in my opinion, that\u2019s all it was. Men tend to like it when women arouse our protective instincts; it makes us feel heroic.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou sound like you\u2019re speaking from experience,\u201d she couldn\u2019t stop herself from pointing out, and he sneered.</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell do you think I kept coming back to you?\u201d She had known it was coming, but she had been unable to prevent herself from rushing into those deep, dark waters. \u201cYou made me feel like an all-conquering hero. You kept staring at me with those doe eyes, and I felt like I could take on the world. It\u2019s a heady thing, being elevated to near-godlike status like that. I should never have let things go so far. You were a na\u00efve little thing and I took everything you offered, but when we had sex and I learned that you were a virgin, I had no option but to do the right thing, didn\u2019t I? Especially since we were so stupid and careless that first time. Even though I wasn\u2019t keen on the idea of kids, I didn\u2019t want any child of mine growing up without my name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201d She asked softly, glad for once that he could not hear the emotion in her voice but unable to hide the tears sparkling in her eyes. \u201cThat our marriage was based on a lie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo lie.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cWell, okay, maybe a lie by omission. I never told you why I was proposing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought . . .\u201d that you loved me. She couldn\u2019t bring herself to say the words, and her voice faded into nothing.</p><p>\u201cI know what you thought, but I felt it was best to allow you to continue believing in your happily-ever-after fairy tale.\u201d There was absolutely nothing she could say in response to that, and she stared at him through her misty eyes. He broke eye contact first and raised his glass to his lips, taking a hearty slurp from it. For a second she was almost certain his hand was trembling, but he quickly lowered it and raised his gaze to meet hers once again. There was nothing but disdain in that stare, and she knew that she had imagined the slight trace of vulnerability. \u201cWould you like to meet Alice? I\u2019m sure the two of you will get along.\u201d</p> <p>Surprised by the sudden change in subject and the unexpected gentleness in his voice, she nodded helplessly. She had lost contact with all of the friends she had made at university. She had tried contacting a few of them since her return. Of course, most of them had moved on to their postgraduate studies, a few had left the city to continue their studies elsewhere, but the ones who had remained had shown no real desire to resume their friendships with her. If she could befriend Pierre\u2019s wife, it would go a long way toward staving off the crushing loneliness she was starting to feel in this house.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d She lowered her eyes to her plate, lifting her knife and fork in an attempt to pretend that nothing was amiss, but the violent trembling in her hands made a liar of her, and she had no choice but to put the utensils back down. She really should not be this devastated by the knowledge that everything she had initially believed about her marriage was a lie. Like her belief that Bryce had married her because he loved her when he had never loved her. His revelations should hold no surprise, not after the way he\u2019d treated her two years ago. Still his words had hurt so much more than they should have; it felt like she had been punched in the stomach, and the pain was unrelenting.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll invite them to dinner tomorrow night. Pierre and I have business to discuss anyway,\u201d he said softly, and she nodded, lowering her head even more, petrified that he would see her tears. She stared blurrily down at her plate but was barely able to see its contents. To her absolute horror she felt the scalding tears overflowing and watched as they dripped into her plate. With an agonized sound, she hurriedly got to her feet, scrubbing at her face in the process. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI . . . excuse . . .\u201d She caught a brief look at his grim face, and unable to stand it anymore, she fled, hearing his muffled curse on her way out. There was a horrible silence, followed by an equally horrible crash as Bryce apparently flung something against a wall. The sound of breaking glass spurred her on and she was up the stairs and into her room like a shot. Thankfully the violent noise had not awoken Kayla, and Bronwyn curled up into a small ball in the center of her bed, leaving the lights off, needing the dark to lick her gaping wounds in private.</p><p>She had awakened in his arms. Bronwyn smiled in contentment and snuggled closer. His strong arms tightened around her and he kissed the top of her head almost reverently. They had been seeing each other for only a month but the chemistry between them had been so potent that it had not taken much for Bronwyn to forget all her grandmother\u2019s warnings about men and their \u201csalacious appetites.\u201d In fact she thought she had been particularly strong in not giving in much sooner; Bryce was a very persuasive kisser, and tonight it hadn\u2019t taken much for them to fall into bed together. It had been her first time, and Bryce had been a little shocked at the discovery. He had been excruciatingly gentle and incredibly thorough in making sure that she was completely satisfied. He hadn't left an inch of her body unexplored. Now she was limp, sated, and wondering when they would be able to do it again. She moved her thigh experimentally but still found him disappointingly unprepared for a second round.</p><p>\u201cGive me a second,\u201d he groaned. \u201cYou wore me out, damn it. I need to regain my strength!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just can\u2019t keep up with me, can you?\u201d She purred teasingly and he growled before flipping her onto her back, pinning her down, and kissing her thoroughly. She felt him stir against her and grinned against his lips.</p> <p>\u201cNow that\u2019s more like it,\u201d she murmured encouragingly, and he grinned, lifting his head to look down at her. The grin faded abruptly and his eyes went silver with desire and something deeper, something so achingly tender it made Bronwyn\u2019s heart melt.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t remember my life before you,\u201d he said wonderingly. \u201cI can\u2019t remember me without you. I never want to let you go. Tell me you\u2019ll marry me . . . please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBryce?\u201d she whispered uncertainly.</p><p>\u201cBronwyn Kirkland, will you marry me?\u201d he asked almost desperately. She was so overwhelmed by his words that she could do nothing but nod.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, Bryce, I love you so much,\u201d she managed to whisper, her voice thick with tears of joy.</p> <p>\u201cShhh . . . don\u2019t cry . . .\u201d he soothed as he slid gently into her welcoming body. \u201cNo more tears. We\u2019re going to be so happy together.\u201d</p><p>She awoke in his arms, feeling both warm and protected. Bronwyn felt a dizzying sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as she struggled to find her bearings. She couldn\u2019t believe that she had fallen asleep after the emotional turmoil at dinner\u2014she had been so certain that her tumultuous thoughts would keep her awake. She had her face pressed to his chest and she could feel his heart beating steadily beneath her cheek.</p><p>\u201cBryce?\u201d she whispered tentatively, not sure where her dreams ended and real life began. Maybe she was just now waking up after their first time together and everything in between had been nothing but a vivid dream. He didn\u2019t stir and she moved restlessly against him, feeling his arms tighten possessively around her. His large hands started stroking her back leisurely and she burrowed closer, reveling in the comfort and not quite ready to relinquish it yet. She still wasn\u2019t certain if this was a dream or real, but she didn\u2019t care anymore; she was in Bryce\u2019s arms exactly where she belonged.</p><p>His warm hands crept beneath the thin cotton blouse she was wearing until his dry palms found the soft, naked skin of her slender back. She sucked in a breath at the electrifying contact and arched toward him with a slight moan. It felt like forever since he had touched her last. Her hands crept up over his broad chest, feeling the heat of his skin through the thin material of his T-shirt. She looked up, trying to see his face in the dark, but she could see nothing except the gleam of his eyes.</p><p>\u201cBryce . . .\u201d she murmured dreamily, half-asleep and still lost in the memory of her dream. She lifted a hand to his face. She loved the feel of his stubbled jaw beneath her hand. He made a slight sound and abruptly lowered his head to capture her soft, surprised lips with his hard and demanding mouth. The kiss was a lot more ruthless than she had anticipated; she had been expecting gentleness, not this almost violent caress. Still it was Bryce, her beloved Bryce, and she would deny him nothing. His kiss softened and became almost desperate as he leaned into her and over her, until she was flat on her back and he was cradled between her spread thighs. He loomed above her, not once relinquishing contact with her soft mouth, and she moaned as she wrapped her arms tightly around his neck, not wanting to let him go ever again.</p><p>He eventually came up for air and fumbled with the buttons of her blouse, while she tugged at his T-shirt and dragged it over his head before he had managed even half of the buttons. Losing patience, he ripped the fragile garment apart, sending mother-of-pearl buttons flying everywhere. Bronwyn giggled and Bryce stilled abruptly.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed your laughter . . .\u201d The sound of his sexy, smoky voice startled her into complete wakefulness. \u201cI always loved your laugh.\u201d He sounded so wistful that Bronwyn wished she could see his face. She raised a curious hand to his mouth but he leaned back, denying her the contact.</p><p>\u201cBryce what . . .\u201d she started to say, but he cursed softly before leaning to the side and switching on the bedside lamp. The unwelcome present immediately forced its way into the bedroom as Bronwyn found herself staring up into the rough-hewn features of an older, harsher Bryce than the one she\u2019d just dreamed about. This was not the man she had fallen in love with; this man was battle scarred and hated her more than she had ever believed possible. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI want to see you,\u201d he muttered harshly. \u201cWhen you speak, I want to know what you\u2019re saying! When you laugh, I want to see your eyes light up, and when I make you come\u201d\u2014his voice lowered sexily\u2014\u201cI want to see you scream even if I can\u2019t hear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think . . .\u201d she began uncertainly, preferring to make love with him in the dark, where she could fool herself into believing that he was the old Bryce, the one who had pretended to love her, even if he now claimed that he never had. A shaft of agony pierced through her as she recalled his confession at dinner, and she tried to move away from him but he would not permit it. He pinned her down, his eyes boring into hers, so that she was unable to hide her pain from him. His brows lowered into an intimidating frown, and she flinched, wondering what scathing remark he had in store for her this time.</p><p>\u201cYou were crying at dinner,\u201d he said almost accusingly.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you expect?\u201d she asked bitterly. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep cutting me without spilling my blood, Bryce.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSuch drama.\u201d He grinned caustically. \u201cDon\u2019t cry again, it irritates me!\u201d The demand was so ridiculously petulant that she gaped at him in astonishment. He took advantage of her open mouth and swooped in for another hungry kiss.</p><p>\u201cI want you,\u201d he groaned, grinding against her so that she would have no trouble mistaking his meaning. \u201cI want to make love with you.\u201d He raised his head to look down at her, trying to gauge her receptiveness.</p><p>\u201cOnly it\u2019s not \u2018making love,\u2019 is it?\u201d she asked bitterly. \u201cWithout love it\u2019s nothing more than a cheap screw.\u201d He made a dismayed little sound and covered her mouth with his own before she could say anything more. Bronwyn soon forgot everything as his mouth wove a seductive spell over her. His wicked fingers seemed to be everywhere at the same time, and his mouth soon followed.</p><p>He paused when he reached her braless breasts and he stared at them for a long moment. Bronwyn squirmed uncomfortably as she fought the desire to fold her arms over her petite assets. She had always been self-conscious about her small breasts, but Bryce had always loved them. Now he was staring at them almost analytically, and she found herself flushing to the roots of her hair.</p><p>\u201cThey haven\u2019t changed,\u201d he murmured, almost reluctantly raising his eyes to meet hers. \u201cI expected them to be different . . . you know, after Mikayla?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t breastfeed her.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI was ill for a while after the birth, and by the time I was well enough, she was on the bottle and my milk had dried up.\u201d His eyes darkened.</p><p>\u201cIll?\u201d Not wanting to discuss that right now, Bronwyn distracted him the only way she knew how, she arched her back until her nipples brushed his naked chest. She hissed as they made contact with the hot, silky flesh that was lightly dusted with soft, golden hair. He groaned at the contact and lowered his eyes back down to her breasts; they were barely a handful\u2014creamy little mounds with raspberry-red tips. His breath caught on a sob of pure desire, and he bent down and did what she was aching for him to do: he took one of the distended tips into his mouth. She squealed, nearly coming off the bed at the electric jolt that swept through her body, and he raised his head to grin at her.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re still as sensitive as I rem\u2014\u201d He was cut off when she lifted impatient hands and pulled his head back down, forcing him to focus on the task at hand. He laughed wickedly and proceeded to give her what she wanted with as much enthusiasm as she was taking it.</p><p>Soon they were both completely naked, and Bryce paused above her, his arms planted on either side of her head as he held himself aloft. He stared down into her face with an intensity that unnerved her, before reaching over to the nightstand and fumbling open a drawer to yank out a condom. For a painful moment, Bronwyn wondered why he had a handy stash of condoms in the drawer, before he spoke again, immediately distracting her.</p><p>\u201cStill such innocence in those eyes, such trust, they still stare at me with such adoration,\u201d he muttered, half to himself as he dragged on the condom. \u201cHow can your eyes tell such lies?\u201d Shocked by the near hatred in his voice, Bronwyn gasped in horror as she recognized that this act of sex, if completed, would be another cruel means of hurting her, just another weapon to use against her. Before she had a chance to formulate any kind of protest, he entered her with a gentleness that belied his harsh words and took what she had so heedlessly and freely offered just moments ago. She was so well-primed for it that despite everything, she moaned and her slender thighs clenched around his hips. Her long legs wrapped around his waist as she welcomed him back into her body. He had gone completely still, and she opened her eyes to see him staring down at her triumphantly. Her eyes filled with tears and he glared down at her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare,\u201d he warned darkly. \u201cDon\u2019t cry.\u201d She couldn\u2019t help it, tears overflowed even as she shoved herself up against him. He groaned and met her lunge with one of his own.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry.\u201d</p><p>Bronwyn found herself whimpering desperately in time with his thrusts, even while her tears continued to flow and her heart continued to break.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t. Please don\u2019t,\u201d he continued to almost beg, kissing the tears away. His tenderness acted as a balm to her ravaged soul and worked to end the weeping as nothing else could have. \u201cMy beautiful, Bronwyn . . .\u201d</p><p>Her body arched as the sensations heightened and he reached down between their bodies to find her sensitive little clitoris. His long, clever thumb rubbed across the excited nubbin and that, combined with his thickness inside of her, sent her hurtling over the edge of reason. Her breath hitched in her chest and her head tilted back while her entire body convulsed and clenched around him. She screamed as the powerful orgasm swept through her, and Bryce half-laughed incredulously. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He couldn\u2019t take his eyes off her. So absorbed was he in her climax that his own took him completely by surprise. He shouted hoarsely as his entire body bucked and he jerked once, twice before with another shout\u2014her name\u2014he poured himself into her with a broken sob. His eyes closed as his brain shut down and his body went limp. He stirred himself only to remove the condom before flopping down beside her again, dropping a heavy arm over her waist.</p><p>\u201cI miss your breathless little sounds.\u201d He broke the silence five minutes later, after their heartbeats and breathing had returned to normal, just as Bronwyn was starting to feel awkward and wondering now what? \u201cThose half-formed gasping little words, God they used to turn me on more than you can imagine.\u201d She lifted her head from his chest to stare at him.</p><p>\u201cYou never mentioned that before,\u201d she pointed out, and he smiled.</p><p>\u201cBecause I knew that if I\u2019d said anything you would immediately have felt self-conscious about it.\u201d His reminiscent smile became a wicked grin. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t want you tensing up at crucial moments.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYet you feel comfortable enough telling me about it now?\u201d she asked, curious, and he snorted.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t hear them anymore,\u201d he pointed out, and she tensed. \u201cSo getting self-conscious about any sounds you produce while we\u2019re making love is a little pointless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell me what happened to you, Bryce?\u201d she asked faintly, and it was his turn to tense up. \u201cOr are you never going to afford me the opportunity to defend myself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were there,\u201d he reminded grimly, and she frowned irritably.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you keep saying that? What do you mean I was \u2018there\u2019?\u201d she asked angrily. \u201cWhere the hell was I?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere when I had my goddamned accident!\u201d he snapped before launching himself out of bed and stalking around the bedroom angrily, looking for his clothing. She leaped out as well and walked around his back until she was facing him again. She was stark naked, but she no longer cared about anything except getting to the bottom of this strange accusation.</p><p>\u201cI was not there when you had your accident!\u201d she retorted indignantly.</p><p>\u201cI saw you,\u201d he forced the words out between clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She was completely baffled now. \u201cSaw me where? Bryce I don\u2019t even know when you had your accident. Please just tell me what happened!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt burns me to have to tell you something that you already know, Bronwyn,\u201d he gritted. \u201cYou\u2019re playing me for a fool and I don\u2019t like it!\u201d He moved to step around her but she put her hands up against his broad chest to stop him. He felt about as immovable as a block of granite.</p><p>\u201cPlease, just . . . just . . .\u201d Her eyes begged him when words failed her.</p> <p>\u201cI went after you that night, when you raced out of here like a bat out of hell,\u201d he said so quietly that his lips barely moved. \u201cAs you knew that I would. You were going so fast that I was terrified you would get into an accident.\u201d His lips twisted at that bit of irony. \u201cIt took me a few minutes to get my car out, so by the time I headed out in the direction you had gone, you\u2019d disappeared. I was frantic and wasn\u2019t paying attention to anything around me. I was so focused on trying to spot your car that I didn\u2019t see the couple crossing the road until it was almost too late. I swerved to avoid them and the car rolled. I was drifting in and out of consciousness, trapped in the car, when I saw you standing there amongst the crowd, staring at me with nothing but ice-cold contempt on your face . . . you heartless bitch!\u201d He hissed viciously. \u201cYou turned around and walked away without so much as a backward glance.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t even surprised when I woke up three days later in Intensive Care to be informed that you hadn\u2019t even bothered to visit or call. I couldn\u2019t have cared less if I never saw you again but for the fact that you were having my baby. You were having my baby and you had simply disappeared off the face of the earth. Is it any wonder I hate you? Not only is my accident your fault, but you walked away from me when I was at my most vulnerable, when I needed you most, and you took my daughter along with you!\u201d</p><p>Bronwyn\u2019s face was ashen with shock at his story. She ached to think of the agony he must have gone through in that hospital, wondering about his baby, but she was also filled to the brim with fury and offense that he dared to think she could do something so awful as walk away from him while he lay injured and bleeding. Not to mention his ridiculous statement that the accident had been her fault when he had caused the entire sorry situation.</p><p>\u201cI concede,\u201d she began quietly, with barely repressed sarcasm, \u201cthat maybe the accident was my fault because for some crazy reason I saw fit to flee after you drove me out of the house right when I needed you most. But I absolutely refuse to listen to this nonsense about me standing impassively by the side of the road while you lay bleeding and trapped in a car. Or, worse, walking away while you were still in the car!</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know that you\u2019d been in an accident until the day you walked into my hospital room. I would never have stood there watching you suffer, and if I had known you were in the hospital, no force in heaven or hell would have kept me away from your bedside, because, even though you had treated me like something to be scraped off the bottom of your boot, I still loved you so damned much!\u201d He started to say something but she held up her hand.</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019ve had your turn; it\u2019s only fair I get a chance to defend myself against this . . . this insult! I did not think you would immediately come chasing after me\u2014you were so irrationally angry that I knew you needed time to calm down. I headed straight for the beach house in Knysna. I stopped only for brief bathroom breaks and drove the distance in just under five and a half hours. I was confident that once you had time to calm down and think, you would change your mind about the baby.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI saw you,\u201d he maintained, clearly not believing her. \u201cSaw you with my own eyes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were sliding in and out of consciousness; you were in shock and in pain . . .\u201d she pointed out reasonably. \u201cYou don\u2019t think that maybe you were delirious as well? Seeing things that were not there?\u201d</p><p>He frowned and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not,\u201d she scoffed. \u201cNot Bryce Palmer, he never makes mistakes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGod damn you,\u201d he growled. \u201cI know what I saw . . . you were standing there looking impassive and completely uncaring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis?\u201d She waved her hand back and forth between their naked bodies. \u201cThis thing that just happened between us? It was a mistake that shouldn\u2019t be repeated. I should never have let you touch me, but you got me in a moment of complete weakness. That ends now. I won\u2019t allow a man who just hours ago said I made his skin crawl use me like this again. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I need a shower,\u201d she informed him unsteadily. There was really nothing she could say or do right now to prove that she hadn\u2019t been there that day. She didn\u2019t know if she\u2019d ever be able to convince him that she hadn\u2019t been there. He seemed so convinced.</p><p>That a man she had once thought loved her could believe something so unspeakable about her was incredibly painful. Bryce was completely wrapped up in his thoughts and did not even seem to notice when she left the room. Bronwyn escaped to the en suite bathroom and locked the door securely behind her, afraid that he would come in and bombard her with yet more reasons he did not believe her. She ran the shower as hot as she could stand it but shivered beneath the relentless spray. God, if he had spent the last two years believing something so awful about her, it was no wonder he hated her so much. It was an obstacle that could not easily be overcome because he had it firmly in his head that she had betrayed him in the worst possible way by leaving him literally broken and bleeding.</p><p>She knew how her stubborn ass of a husband\u2019s mind worked. To his way of thinking, all of his sins were now superseded by her \u201cunforgivable betrayal.\u201d How very convenient for him. It made complete sense that he would believe something like this about her. It was easier for him to blame her and hate her rather than deal with the fact that due to his own thoughtless actions he had lost his wife, his child, and his hearing all on the same night. Unfortunately he didn\u2019t doubt what he had seen that night, and while Bronwyn could understand why his mind had fabricated this bizarre coping mechanism, she couldn\u2019t forgive it.</p><p>She hunched over and clasped her arms around her midriff, afraid that she would be sick. She swallowed down the nausea and leaned back against the tiles of the shower stall, sliding down against the wall until she was sitting on the floor with her knees raised to her chest. She had her face buried in her knees and her arms covering her head.</p> <p>She did not know how long she sat there shivering, unable to get warm, unable to even cry as she tried to deal with the shock of knowing how very much her husband despised her. The needle-like spray suddenly stopped and Bronwyn raised her head hesitantly, a bit disorientated by the sudden cessation of water. She looked up to find Bryce standing at the entrance of the shower stall and was baffled by his unexpected appearance.</p><p>\u201cBut I locked the door,\u201d she murmured in a small voice that he might not have caught if he\u2019d had his hearing.</p><p>\u201cYou forgot to lock the other door,\u201d he pointed out quietly, able to read her lips despite the steam, and she groaned, remembering that the luxurious bathroom was shared by two bedrooms. \u201cCome on, Bron . . . you need to dry off. You\u2019ll make yourself sick again.\u201d She noticed, for the first time, that he had a huge, fluffy, white bath towel draped over his hands. She nodded but didn\u2019t move, and Bryce shocked her by stepping into the wet stall, uncaring of the fact that he wore socks and was dressed in clean boxer shorts and a T-shirt. He hunkered down in front of her and draped the bath towel around her shoulders, helping her up in the process.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been in here for nearly an hour,\u201d he informed her grimly. She tilted her face to his, still shivering violently.</p><p>\u201cI . . . I c-couldn\u2019t get warm,\u201d she stuttered, and he frowned, evidently not catching that, but probably understanding the gist of it. He wrapped his arms around her and dragged her nude, wet body to his. He held her so tightly and so closely that the trembling abated almost immediately. He led her out of the shower stall and unlocked the door, leading her back into the master bedroom. He gently steered her toward the bed and seated her on the edge, kneeling in front of her as he patted her dry with the fluffy towel.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wet,\u201d she observed inanely, noting the dampness of his T-shirt and shorts while she tried not to stare at his muscular naked legs. He had showered as well, if his damp hair was anything to go by. He caught her words because he was looking directly at her when she said them and shrugged in response.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll dry,\u201d he dismissed. She noticed that it was still dark outside and grimaced. She checked the time on the alarm clock on her bedside pedestal; it was just after three thirty.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you come to my room tonight?\u201d she asked hoarsely, and even though she was looking right at him when she asked it, he did not respond. Instead he lowered his eyes and continued to pat her dry. He left her briefly to pad to the bathroom and returned moments later with a smaller towel for her hair.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to dry this,\u201d he was muttering. \u201cYou\u2019ve been so sick; I don\u2019t think it would be wise for you to sleep with wet hair. Where is your dryer?\u201d She pointed to her dresser and he picked her up, ignoring the jerky movement of protest she made. He deposited her on the padded seat in front of the dressing table, and Bronwyn was confronted by her own haggard reflection. She looked a sight; her face was gaunt and unnaturally pale, and her eyes looked feverishly bright and overly large. The towel was still draped around her shoulders, but it had fallen open to reveal the thin body beneath. To Bronwyn\u2019s own eyes she looked too thin, and she wondered how Bryce had been able to bring himself to touch her when she looked like this. He switched on the machine and started drying her hair, running his fingers through it with a rough tenderness. She blinked in surprise and sluggishly raised her hands in an attempt to take the blow dryer from him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can do it,\u201d she protested. He lifted the machine out of her reach and watched her in the mirror until she dropped her arms in resignation. He grunted in satisfaction and went back to the task of drying her hair.</p><p>When it was dry enough to suit him, he ran a brush through the dark, silky mass and then tied it back with one of the hair ties lying scattered on the dressing table. He picked her up again and deposited her back onto the unmade bed, tucking her under the covers and tossing the towel aside before climbing in beside her and dragging her stiff body close to his. She lay with her head on his chest, listening to his heart beat steadily beneath her ear and wondering what this was all about. He remained silent though and eventually Bronwyn relaxed enough to drift off to sleep again.</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>Bronwyn cautiously opened her eyes to a sunlit bedroom. There was no sign of Bryce, and instinct told her that it was way after midday. She heard Kayla\u2019s joyful laughter outside, and she guessed the little girl was in the swimming pool, probably with her father, who was diligently teaching her how to swim. Bryce had had a childproof fence built around the pool sometime during her absence, another one of those preparations he\u2019d made in anticipation of a child he\u2019d had no idea if he\u2019d ever meet.</p> <p>Bronwyn sat up shakily, feeling refreshed yet strangely hollow. She felt like someone who\u2019d had a long and desperately needed sleep after the death of a loved one, only to wake up to the discovery that even though life would go on, it would be forever marred by the tragedy of loss. She could not remember the last time she had slept so soundly, possibly that last night before leaving Bryce two years ago; she certainly had not had much peace of mind since then. She got up and made her way to the bathroom, trying not to think of the night before. She wasn\u2019t sure what any of it had signified and definitely wasn\u2019t sure where it left her and Bryce.</p><p>She made her way downstairs a little over half an hour later, wearing a pair of faded jeans and an old T-shirt. The clothes were from her old wardrobe and were too baggy on her. Bronwyn resolved to eat even more, still feeling incredibly unattractive because of her thinness.</p><p>When she reached the living room, she stood at the open patio doors staring out at the pair in the water for the longest time, feeling ambivalent about the obvious enjoyment they seemed to find in each other\u2019s company. She felt a little left out and again bitter toward Bryce for allowing this to happen to them. She was about to turn away and head in search of something to eat when Bryce glanced up and caught sight of her. She could not see his expression because of the sun\u2019s glare off the water, but he went strangely still before heading toward the side of the pool and depositing a protesting Kayla on the paving before heaving himself out alongside her.</p><p>\u201cDaddy more swim . . .\u201d the child was protesting, but he was watching Bronwyn and did not see her display of temper. Bronwyn watched in amazement as the little girl impatiently patted her father on his leg and made a clumsy sign that Bronwyn knew signified \u201cdaddy\u201d or \u201cfather.\u201d Bronwyn was familiar with it because she had been meaning to teach her daughter the word in sign language. Bryce looked down at his precocious offspring and grinned when she said \u201cdaddy\u201d with one of her chubby hands again before making swimming gestures.</p><p>\u201cLater, baby,\u201d he laughingly promised, picking her up and depositing her on his wide, bronzed shoulders. \u201cFirst we\u2019ll have some lunch with your mummy.\u201d The child looked up and noticed Bronwyn for the first time. The delight on her little face warmed Bronwyn\u2019s heart. Bryce had pretty much monopolized the little girl\u2019s time since their arrival eleven days ago. And while he sometimes seemed at a loss as to how to deal with Kayla, he was muddling through without asking Bronwyn for any assistance. It concerned her that he seemed so able around the child. She worried that he might start to wonder why he needed Bronwyn around at all. Now that she was feeling healthier, she vowed to spend more time with the little girl whom she had missed so much. She wouldn\u2019t allow Bryce to usurp her so completely any longer.</p> <p>Bryce made his way toward her, and she stepped onto the patio, relishing the feel of the hot, early autumn sun on her face. She picked up a bright-pink beach towel adorned with characters from Disney\u2019s Finding Nemo cartoon and held it up as he deposited the happily chattering little girl into Bronwyn\u2019s arms. She wrapped the towel around Kayla and hugged her small body close. Her daughter was bubbling on about swimming, her daddy, and various other concerns that were of great importance to any nearly nineteen-month-old little girl. Bronwyn nodded and made the appropriate noises, but she was preoccupied with Bryce, whose eyes were sweeping over her from top to bottom, making her feel naked and vulnerable.</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d he asked quietly, and she shrugged, managing a slight smile.</p><p>\u201cWell rested.\u201d</p><p>He nodded at her reply but seemed at a loss for words.</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re hungry. You\u2019re just in time for lunch,\u201d he said, gesturing toward the glass-and-wrought-iron patio table situated close to the huge stone barbeque at the other end of the large patio. Celeste was just laying out what looked like a delicious lunch. The older woman, always one of few words, flashed them a smile and retreated with a nod.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m famished.\u201d She nodded and headed toward the table, depositing a still-prattling Kayla into her high chair and placing the provided plastic bowl and plastic spoon onto the surface in front of the toddler.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s a messy eater,\u201d Bryce pointed out with a wince, and Bronwyn grinned, realizing that he must have discovered that particular trait the hard way. Most of Kayla\u2019s meals seemed to wind up all over herself and anybody else in the general vicinity, but the little girl obdurately refused to allow anybody to feed her, insisting that she could do it herself. It was a stubborn streak that she had inherited from her father, and Bronwyn wished that she had been there to witness that particular battle of wills firsthand. It must have been a novelty for Bryce to discover someone as hardheaded as himself, especially someone as tiny as Mikayla. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d Bronwyn smiled. \u201cShe rejects any attempt to help feed her. I usually give her extra portions in the hopes that she manages to get as much of it into her mouth as she does all over everything else. But sometimes I have to take the bull by the horns and feed her myself anyway, despite her fervent protests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is also inordinately fond of ice cream,\u201d he pointed out with a grimace, seeming to recall something particularly unpleasant.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing you discovered one of her favorite pastimes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinger painting?\u201d He nodded and she laughed.</p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately ice cream, especially chocolate, seems to be her favorite medium,\u201d Bronwyn said solemnly.</p><p>\u201cI thought Celeste would quit after Kayla demonstrated her talent on the kitchen walls, but luckily she seems to have the patience of a saint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope that you reprimanded Kayla?\u201d Bronwyn asked with a frown, and he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cShe seemed so proud of her painting,\u201d he responded, and Bronwyn sighed before shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s testing you,\u201d she informed. \u201cShe knows better than to mess on the walls, she wouldn\u2019t dare do it at ho\u2014\u201d She halted, knowing that the word home would be a mistake and not wanting to destroy the fragile peace between them. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t have done that in our old flat. She wants to see how much she\u2019ll be able to get away with here. You\u2019ve got to be firm with her, Bryce. Don\u2019t let her take advantage of you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know how to go about reprimanding her,\u201d he offered quietly. \u201cI haven\u2019t had much practice at this fatherhood business. I want her to like me.\u201d Judging from the pained look on his face, it grated to admit as much and she bit her lip, unsure how to respond without rekindling hostilities.</p><p>\u201cI can guarantee,\u201d she began reluctantly, not really wanting to help him with this but knowing that it was in Kayla\u2019s best interests, \u201cthat she loves you already, Bryce. She won\u2019t like it if you raise your voice to her, she may even shed a few fake little tears, but she\u2019ll get over it. You\u2019re as much of an authority figure to her as I am now, and she has to get used to that. We\u2019re here to teach her right from wrong. If we don\u2019t she\u2019ll become a spoiled brat. And while a bit of spoiling never hurt anyone, I would not want her to become intolerable.\u201d He was paying close attention to her mouth, and Bronwyn was careful to enunciate clearly and slowly.</p><p>\u201cIt makes sense, I suppose,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll try to be a little less indulgent, but it\u2019s still such a treat for me to give her things and spoil her a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s understandable.\u201d Bronwyn nodded. \u201cYou\u2019ll get over it soon enough, once the novelty wears off and she becomes bratty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll never be that bratty.\u201d He grinned before becoming quite serious. \u201cYou did a good job with her, Bron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh . . .\u201d The compliment was as unexpected as it was flattering, and Bronwyn had no idea how to respond to it. \u201cThank you.\u201d She could not read his mood at all and wondered if she could trust what seemed to be an armed and uneasy truce. She bent her head and focused on her food. The cook had prepared a light lunch of crispy fried filleted hake\u2014a delicious Cape game fish\u2014herbed baby potatoes, and steamed fresh vegetables. Her mouth fairly watered at the sight of it. She checked Kayla\u2019s bowl and was gratified to note that the little girl\u2019s vegetables had been mashed into manageable chunks. Kayla had already started digging in with her chubby little fingers, and Bryce groaned when she proceeded to lift her fist to her mouth and suck the food off it.</p> <p>\u201cMummy.\u201d She picked up a piece of fish between two grubby fingers and held it up to her mother. \u201cHmm nice . . . Mummy . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already have food, Kayla. See?\u201d she pointed out, lifting a fork with some fish speared onto the tines. Kayla dropped the fish back into her bowl and lifted her plastic spoon and attempted to imitate her mother. When the fish kept falling back into the bowl, she glared and tossed the spoon aside in frustration before resorting to using her hands again. Bronwyn put aside her own utensils and lifted the plastic spoon, firmly placing it back into her daughter\u2019s hands.</p><p>\u201cUse the spoon, Mikayla,\u201d she ordered firmly, but the little girl shook her head mutinously.</p><p>\u201cNo \u2019poon, Mummy,\u201d the child protested, tossing it aside again the moment her mother let her hand go.</p><p>\u201cKayla, I\u2019m not going to tell you again,\u201d Bronwyn warned, picking the spoon up and wrapping the child\u2019s stubborn fingers around it. Bryce watched the little power play unfold in fascination. Kayla, knowing how far she could push her mother, sulkily held on to the spoon and clumsily rooted around her bowl, messing about rather than actually attempting to eat. Bronwyn ignored the recalcitrant child and quite deliberately went back to her own lunch.</p><p>Kayla was now scooping up spoonfuls of food and placing it in little mounds on the tray of the high chair in front of her. Bronwyn finished off the last of her fish and sighed before dragging a wet wipe from the container Celeste had thoughtfully left within easy reach and wiping Kayla\u2019s face and hands clean. She ignored the way the child tried to evade her attempts and after giving her face a thorough wipe, Bron lifted the squirming toddler out of the high chair and into her own lap. She grabbed Kayla\u2019s bowl and spoon and very determinedly began spooning food into the protesting child\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cNo, Mummy, no! No!\u201d Kayla was sobbing hysterically and working herself up into a fine little tantrum. Bronwyn could feel it in the way her small body was tensing up more and more. \u201cKayla no want! Kayla no like!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cKayla, you will eat your food!\u201d Bronwyn managed in her sternest voice. The child\u2019s determined squirming was rapidly tiring her mother out, and Bronwyn knew that she would have to give up the fight soon. She lifted the spoon to Kayla\u2019s mouth, and the baby kept her mouth tightly shut, turning her head away.</p><p>\u201cMikayla!\u201d The unfamiliar sound of Bryce\u2019s raised voice shocked both mother and child into momentary stillness. Kayla\u2019s eyes swallowed her face when they encountered her father\u2019s stern countenance. His voice softened on his next words. \u201cListen to your mummy.\u201d</p><p>The child obediently opened her mouth to the proffered spoon, her large blue eyes never wavering from her father\u2019s face. She took in bite after bite until she had emptied her bowl, and when she was done, she begged to be let down. Bronwyn helped her down and watched with a helpless smile of sheer adoration as Kayla toddled over to her father and crawled into his lap, curling herself up and tucking her thumb into her mouth. Bryce\u2019s face reflected a mixture of surprise, aching vulnerability, and confusion as he wrapped his arms around the sleepy little girl. He lifted his awestruck eyes to Bronwyn\u2019s smiling face.</p><p>\u201cShe always gets a little peevish when she\u2019s tired,\u201d Bronwyn informed, watching as Kayla\u2019s eyelids drooped more and more until she was fast asleep.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m hesitant about raising my voice to her,\u201d he admitted quietly. \u201cI find it difficult to judge exactly how loud I\u2019m actually being. I don\u2019t want to terrify her. Sometimes I worry that . . .\u201d</p><p>He left the sentence hanging and dropped his eyes down to his daughter\u2019s sleeping face. Bronwyn waited, hoping that he would finish what he had been about to say, sensing that he had been about to reveal something deeply personal. He didn\u2019t say anything further though, and it left her wondering about the insecurity she had heard in his voice.</p><p>\u201cBron . . .\u201d he said after a long silence. He kept his gaze trained on Kayla\u2019s sleeping face. \u201cAbout last night?\u201d Bronwyn tensed, and she lowered her eyes to the ice-cold glass of mango juice in her hands.</p><p>\u201cI just . . . I never meant . . .\u201d He paused again, and the silence grated on her nerves until she could stand it no more. His beautiful blue eyes at last rose to meet hers.</p><p>\u201cLook, Bryce,\u201d she said, breaking the silence, hoping that her face reflected the resolution that she could hear in her voice. \u201cI know how much you hate me. In fact, believing what you do about me, I can even understand why you feel the way you do. Anybody who would so cold-bloodedly desert their spouse at the scene of an accident is certainly someone who deserves no forgiveness.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not even going to try to defend myself anymore,\u201d she said firmly, interrupting whatever he\u2019d been about to say. \u201cThere\u2019s really no point, is there? You\u2019ve hated me for so long I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be able to change your mind. All I ask is that you put this . . . this contempt you have for me aside for Kayla\u2019s sake. Hate me if you must. I think I can almost live with it now that I know you never really loved me, but try to be less obvious about it.\u201d His eyes narrowed as he assessed her face; there was another lengthy silence as he considered her words before shrugging.</p><p>\u201cI have a couple of questions,\u201d he murmured, and she bit her lip before nodding. \u201cHow long were you at the beach house?\u201d Whatever she had expected, that certainly wasn\u2019t it. She blinked a couple of times before shrugging.</p><p>\u201cA couple of weeks,\u201d she managed softly.</p><p>\u201cSo, if your story is to be believed . . .\u201d</p><p>She resisted the overwhelming urge to reach over and slap him for the blatant sarcasm in his voice.</p> <p>\u201c. . . You went there directly after leaving here, to wait for me, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we just agree to let this matter go?\u201d she asked, not in the mood to defend herself against any more of his crazy accusations.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shrugged her request aside nonchalantly. \u201cSo, how is it that you never once heard about my accident? Apparently it was in all the papers and had news coverage on radio, television, and the Internet. Are you telling me you missed all of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo really think that I spent my days watching the telly and listening to music?\u201d she asked in exasperation. \u201cI could barely drag myself out of bed and into the shower most days. I was ill from the morning sickness, exhausted, scared, and every day that passed without word from you sent me deeper into depressed isolation. So yes, I\u2019m telling you I missed all of that!\u201d</p><p>His eyes flickered and she thought she caught a glimmer of uncertainty in them before they went icy with disdain again. She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cWhen are Rick and Lisa due back from their holiday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaturday,\u201d he replied shortly before continuing on with the original conversation. \u201cSo after it became painfully self-evident that I would not be coming for you, what did you do then?\u201d Not caring for the mockery in his eyes and voice and fed up with his determination to disbelieve every little thing she said, Bronwyn got up shakily and rounded the table, reaching out possessively to take her daughter from his arms.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll put her to bed,\u201d she told him without meeting his eyes.</p> <p>\u201cYour story is full of holes, Bronwyn, you know that,\u201d he murmured almost gently. \u201cI\u2019d be willing to move on if you\u2019d only admit to being at the scene of my accident.\u201d She lifted blazingly furious eyes to his.</p><p>\u201cIt would be so terribly convenient for you if I admitted to that, wouldn\u2019t it, Bryce?\u201d she asked angrily. \u201cThat way you wouldn\u2019t have to feel any guilt about driving your pregnant wife out into the streets. No guilt about leaving her to fend for herself while she was so ill she was terrified she would lose your baby. You wouldn\u2019t have to be accountable for anything that has happened since the night I left. Well, you can go to hell because I refuse to give you that satisfaction.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bronwyn turned away angrily and carried Kayla back into the house. She headed straight for the baby\u2019s room and after tucking her in, stood beside the cot and watched the baby sleep, her heart absolutely overflowing with love for the innocent child.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re worth everything, my darling,\u201d she whispered, leaning over to kiss her short, silky curls. When she straightened up and turned around, Bryce was standing in the doorway, still wearing nothing but his board shorts. She frowned resentfully, annoyed that a deaf man could move so silently, and moved to pass him. He barely shifted, crowding her abominably as she tried to squeeze through the doorway and into the hall. She flushed crimson when she inadvertently brushed against his muscular naked chest. She frowned up at him, making sure he was looking at her before she spoke.</p><p>\u201cGet out of my way,\u201d she demanded, and he grinned lazily.</p><p>\u201cGlad to see you\u2019re getting your fire back, babe . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that,\u201d she reprimanded, and he grinned.</p><p>\u201cYou never complained before.\u201d She went an even brighter red as she recalled the very rare instances during which he had used the endearment in the past\u2014always in the most intimate of circumstances and very rarely outside of bed. He had used it now just to rattle her\u2014she could see it in his eyes. She pursed her lips and pushed her way past him. He grabbed her wrist, just as she thought she\u2019d managed to escape.</p><p>\u201cPierre and Alice are coming around for dinner,\u201d he informed her idly, ignoring the way she tugged furiously, trying to get loose. \u201cTry not to embarrass me with any more lies or insincere shows of concern while they\u2019re here.\u201d She gasped at the sharp stab of pain at his casual cruelty.</p><p>\u201cBryce, I\u2019m really starting to hate you,\u201d she stated conversationally, and he raised his brows lazily.</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d He smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s a shame. I did so enjoy being worshipped by you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI never worshipped you, you arrogant bastard!\u201d she managed furiously. \u201cI loved you. More than you could ever comprehend.\u201d His grip slackened and she tugged herself free. \u201cI now see that you never deserved that love!\u201d He seemed unable to respond, merely keeping his level gaze on her emotional face. She made a despairing little sound in the back of her throat and turned to walk away.</p><p>\u201cBronwyn,\u201d he called after her, and she stopped, her back going rigid as she braced herself for another blow. \u201cIf you loved me you would never have left me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t leave you, you jackass,\u201d she muttered beneath her breath, knowing that he could not see the denial while she stood with her back to him.</p><p>\u201cYou would never have driven off without giving me the chance to apologize . . .\u201d His voice was closer, and she knew that he had come up right behind her. \u201cYou would have stayed to hear me grovel and beg your forgiveness, because if you loved me, you would have known me well enough to appreciate that an apology would not be far off.\u201d His hands came to rest on her narrow shoulders, and she flinched as she felt the warmth of his flesh through the thin cotton of her T-shirt. She turned around slowly and lifted her eyes to meet his.</p><p>\u201cI knew that,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI left to give you some space to clear your head and to give myself time to gather my own confused thoughts. I knew you\u2019d come and that\u2019s the reason I waited and waited and waited at that damned beach house! I knew you would come . . . only you never did.</p><p>\u201cWhen I eventually concluded that maybe you really wanted nothing to do with us, I called your office to talk about child support and was quite bluntly informed that\u2014Mr. Palmer did not want to speak to me or hear from me ever again\u2014You weren\u2019t answering your cell phone, and nobody was answering at the house.\u201d She watched as his eyes hardened and his hands fell away.</p> <p>\u201cMy God, can\u2019t you ever stop lying?\u201d he muttered in frustration. \u201cI could buy into maybe being mistaken about seeing you at the scene of my accident. I can even try to believe that maybe you hadn\u2019t seen a single newspaper article, television report, or heard any radio news, but none of my people would ever have said those words to you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, believe what you want, Bryce,\u201d she responded wearily and turned away. She was so sick of defending herself to him.</p><p>\u201cOh no you don\u2019t.\u201d He caught her arm in a bruising grip to prevent her from walking away. \u201cI spent two years looking for you, Bronwyn. Why would I have told my staff to stonewall you when I was trying so hard to find you? So you are not going to try to make me feel guilty about something that I never authorized, something that would never have happened, not in a million years!\u201d She shook her head and stepped back, jerking her arm violently out of his tight grip before deciding to make use of some of the SASL that she had learned and using her hands rather eloquently to say something quite unmistakable. For a second he was taken aback, and he blinked a couple of times before bursting into laughter, the sound so natural and spontaneous that it took her completely by surprise.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t just tell me to . . .\u201d He trailed off before saying the obscenity, and she jutted her jaw stubbornly, refusing to be charmed by his genuine amusement.</p><p>\u201cSo what if I did?\u201d she asked defiantly. His eyes were still brimming with laughter as he shrugged.</p><p>\u201cNothing, I\u2019m just impressed with your extensive knowledge of SASL.\u201d He shrugged and she went bright red.</p><p>\u201cNot that extensive,\u201d she told him self-consciously. \u201cIt was the first thing I learned because I knew that it would probably come in handy in most of my dealings with you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood call,\u201d he complimented, and she cleared her throat before moving away from him without another word and retreating to her bedroom.</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>Alice De Coursey was not all what Bronwyn had been expecting. The woman was a couple of years older than Bronwyn, about thirty, and so tiny that she made Bronwyn feel like a giant by comparison. She could not have been more than five feet tall and had a small, perfectly proportioned body. She had soft brown eyes shielded by silly, little round glasses and she was almost pretty in a wholesome way, with freckles splattered across her nose and an endearingly mischievous grin. Her shoulder-length, uncontrollably frizzy, sandybrown corkscrew curls gave her a kind of Raggedy-Ann appeal. She was certainly not the drop-dead-gorgeous woman Bronwyn had expected a beautiful individual like Pierre De Coursey to fall for. She walked with a slight limp and still had faint scars on her upper arms and a slightly longer, more pronounced one on her round, firm jaw.</p><p>Her intimidatingly gorgeous husband doted on her. In fact every time Pierre looked at her, his eyes positively glowed with love. He lit up when she smiled and beamed whenever she laughed. It was a revelation for Bronwyn to see the previously austere Pierre so transparently in love. The man who had terrified her when she\u2019d first met him now laughed freely, told silly jokes, and changed nappies! Their baby boy, Tristan, was about five months old and had a sweet, placid temperament. He had his father\u2019s pitch-black hair and his mum\u2019s large brown eyes. Kayla was quite excited to see the baby and meet new people, but she fell asleep half an hour after the couple\u2019s arrival.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s such a beautiful little girl,\u201d Alice was telling Bronwyn after the latter had put Kayla to bed. \u201cSuch a little livewire . . .\u201d Bronwyn laughed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a polite way of phrasing it,\u201d she told the woman. \u201cShe\u2019s hell on wheels. When she started toddling, she was an unstoppable force. You wait until Tristan gets to that age; you\u2019ll be running yourself ragged. I\u2019m just happy we managed to get her off to bed with so little fuss tonight.\u201d</p><p>Alice laughed and Bronwyn smiled, really liking the other woman. She had feared that Alice De Coursey would be an unbearable snob, the way Pierre sometimes tended to be, but not only was she not a snob, she had somehow managed to destarch Pierre in many ways. The man was definitely a lot more relaxed and a great deal more pleasant to spend time with. He was fluent in SASL, and he and Bryce were engaged in what looked like a serious conversation. Alice followed her eyes and smiled. She leaned conspiratorially close to Bronwyn.</p><p>\u201cPierre was very relieved when he heard you were back.\u201d</p><p>Bronwyn frowned, that came as a surprise to her; she had always believed that Pierre did not care much for her. In fact he had barely spoken to her after arriving for dinner, leading Bronwyn to assume that he had heard the same story about her as Rick. \u201cFrom what I understand, Bryce became something of a recluse after you left. He hardly ever leaves the house; he works from home, never goes into the office, and leaves it to Pierre to run the more social end of the business.\u201d Bronwyn bit her lip and watched as her husband laughed at something Pierre said, the joke silent and just between the two of them.</p> <p>\u201cWhere did Pierre learn to sign?\u201d she asked quietly, admiring the fluent, graceful gestures of Pierre\u2019s hands.</p><p>\u201cHe used to drive me to my physiotherapy sessions after I had recovered from the accident enough to start strengthening my weak leg, and they happened to have SASL classes at the same clinic, which fortunately coincided with my visits. Pierre saw it as an opportunity to kill two birds with one stone, so to speak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would like to learn,\u201d Bronwyn confided softly. \u201cCould you give me the address of this place?\u201d</p><p>Alice smiled. \u201cOf course.\u201d She nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll even go with you if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>Bronwyn smiled gratefully before nodding. \u201cI\u2019d really like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you enjoy your evening?\u201d Bryce asked in an indulgent voice that grated on Bronwyn\u2019s nerves, after the other couple\u2019s departure. They were standing on the front step watching the taillights on the De Coursey car grow more distant as it made its way down the steep, winding drive leading from the Palmer home back down to the main road.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d She replied abruptly. \u201cAlice is fantastic. I really like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you would,\u201d he confirmed, still looking and sounding like an indulgent father. For some reason Bronwyn felt like slapping the self-satisfied smirk off his face. Did he have to look so damned smug?</p><p>\u201cYes of course.\u201d She looked straight up at him, her eyes gleaming angrily. \u201cAnd, as we all know by now; you\u2019re always right.\u201d He couldn\u2019t hear the venom in her voice, but he could certainly see it in her eyes and he took the tiniest step back.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is wrong now?\u201d he growled furiously.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she hissed. \u201cI\u2019m tired . . . I\u2019m going to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh come on,\u201d he fumed. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to do this to me. You\u2019re not going to play this game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not playing any games. I\u2019m too tired for games.\u201d She turned away and headed back indoors. He followed her inside and caught her elbow to halt her progress. She tried to tug her arm away, but his grip, while gentle, was unrelenting.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he asked on a whisper. \u201cDid Alice or Pierre do or say something to offend you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she shook her head abruptly. \u201cNo, of course not.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo then it\u2019s me?\u201d he stated matter-of-factly.</p><p>\u201cIs it ever anyone else?\u201d she muttered snidely beneath her breath, but he couldn\u2019t read her lips because she ducked her head as she said it. She tried to wriggle her arm and glared up at him when he wouldn\u2019t release her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hurting me!\u201d she stated as clearly as she could, and he let her go abruptly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d His immediate release and apology took her by surprise, and she felt a little guilty when she saw a flare of genuine remorse in his eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut I\u2019m tired and I have nothing more to say to you tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you can dismiss me and expect me to obey like a whipped dog?\u201d he sneered, taking hold of her elbow again and giving her a gentle shake to emphasize his point.</p><p>\u201cNo, I expect you to respect my wishes,\u201d she told him tiredly, all of the fight leaving her. Her arm hung limply in his grip. He sighed and took hold of her other elbow before running his hands caressingly up her arms.</p><p>\u201cTell me why you\u2019re angry with me,\u201d he coaxed, and his large hands moved up to cup her narrow face gently. His thumbs traced the outline of her trembling lips, and he leaned toward her, his lips almost touching hers.</p><p>\u201cI want to be with you again tonight,\u201d he whispered hoarsely, and she flinched.</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head firmly. He frowned and stepped back, releasing her abruptly.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d he asked coldly.</p><p>\u201cHow can you even ask me that? I told you, last night was a mistake. And do you really think I want to get back into bed with the man who said I made his skin crawl?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cLook, I was an ass when I said that, okay?\u201d he admitted, throwing up his hands in surrender. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It was a blatant lie expressly designed to hurt you as much as possible. It was that or admit that you were right about me wanting you the other day.\u201d She continued to stare stonily up at him, knowing that he was repudiating his words now because he wanted her back in his bed.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t beg,\u201d he warned.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting you to,\u201d she muttered, and he frowned uncertainly.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d When she refused to repeat the words he hadn\u2019t caught, he swore angrily and turned away from her. \u201cI hate this! I want to know your every word. I want to hear my daughter\u2019s laughter. I want so many things.\u201d She softened a little at the helpless frustration in his voice and took a step toward him. She rested a tentative hand on his rigid shoulder and stepped around to face him. He shrugged off her hand and glared at her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he warned dangerously, and her brow lowered in confusion.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare pity me.\u201d His voice was as hard as granite, belying the vulnerability she had heard just seconds before. \u201cI don\u2019t want or need your pity!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, the last thing I feel for you is pity,\u201d she told him, but he must have missed the words because his confused frown deepened before he swore in irritation.</p><p>\u201cJust go to bed, Bron,\u201d he muttered tiredly as he brushed by her. Bronwyn watched his broad back as he retreated. He turned a corner and she heard a door slamming in the distance as he shut himself into his study.</p><p>Bronwyn stood there for the longest time, valiantly fighting back her tears of frustration. She did not know this bruised, battered, and embittered man as the Bryce she had adored and married within weeks of meeting him, but there was still something so compelling about him. He reminded her of a badly wounded lion, confused and exhausted but unable to stop fighting.</p><p>She swallowed down the incredible pain of realization, recognition, and resignation. God help her, she still loved Bryce. She had always loved Bryce. She loved him, hated him, and resented him all at the same time. Yet the only other certainty she had in life besides Kayla\u2019s love was the knowledge that Bryce hated her more than she had ever thought possible, and she did not know how she was going to shield her vulnerable heart from the agony that he was so very capable of inflicting on her.</p> <p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Bryce did nothing to hide the deep suspicion in his eyes late the following morning as he took in Bronwyn\u2019s attire. They were in the living room, where Bryce had been glaring down at his laptop screen before she\u2019d distracted him with her presence. She was wearing a pair of designer black slacks, one of the pieces that she had left behind, combined with a pretty silk turquoise top. Despite the fact that the clothes were still a little baggy on her, Bronwyn thought the combination looked charming. Especially with her dark hair falling in lustrous waves to her narrow shoulders and her lips tinted with shell-pink lipstick. She had even taken on a healthy, light-golden sheen after spending some time out in the sun the day before. For the first time in a long while she was relatively happy with the way she looked.</p><p>\u201cOut to lunch, with Alice,\u201d she informed casually, taking a seat opposite his. \u201cWill you be okay with Kayla? She\u2019s in the kitchen with Celeste at the moment. They\u2019re baking a cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019ll be okay with Kayla,\u201d he dismissed before continuing. \u201cWhen was this lunch thing decided?\u201d he asked highhandedly, and she laughed at the autocratic question.</p><p>\u201cNot that it\u2019s any of your business, but this was decided after dinner last night.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, missing her sarcasm.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember you making this arrangement,\u201d he said, clearly trying to recall the evening before. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell you and Pierre were having your little powwow.\u201d She shrugged lightly. \u201cWhat did you expect Alice and I to do? Sit around quietly and wait for our husbands to rejoin us? We talked, hit it off, and befriended each other. This is what friends do. We get together, have lunch, and go shopping . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not well enough to venture out yet,\u201d he said authoritatively. \u201cAlice can come around here for lunch. I\u2019ll SMS Pierre immediately and arrange it.\u201d He whipped his mobile phone out of his jeans pocket, and Bronwyn stayed his hand by placing her smaller one over it.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head decisively, and he frowned.</p><p>\u201cBut . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m meeting Alice for lunch,\u201d she reiterated.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s just too bad, isn\u2019t it?\u201d She was getting annoyed with his arrogance and her glare told him so.</p><p>\u201cHow are you getting there?\u201d She frowned and lifted the set of car keys she was holding.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking the Jeep,\u201d she responded. The Jeep was one of the five cars he owned. Bronwyn had never seen the sense in anyone having more than one car, but Bryce loved his cars. She had already noted that his beloved metallic blue Maserati was gone, and she guessed that it must have been the one he\u2019d been driving when he had his accident.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t give you permission to use the Jeep,\u201d he retaliated smugly, and she bit her lip.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never been selfish with your things; I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d mind,\u201d she said uncertainly.</p><p>\u201cI gave you a car as a wedding present. What happened to it?\u201d he gritted, his eyes narrowing as he reminded her of the beautiful sporty BMW. She flushed as she struggled to respond to that question.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think happened to it? I sold it,\u201d she whispered softly, defiance in her eyes. She had loved that car, but she had sold it before selling her wedding rings. She had clung to her marriage, her love for Bryce, and the rings that had symbolized both, for as long as she possibly could. The corners of his lips curled downward and she lowered her eyes, not wanting to see the contempt he had for her reflected on his face.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked quietly. The question threw her. She had expected yet another one of his scathing set downs.</p><p>\u201cI needed the money,\u201d she confessed huskily. \u201cI was seven months pregnant and I had no place to live. Up till then, I\u2019d been staying in cheap hotels until the money I had in my personal bank account dried up.\u201d The money in her personal account had been hers, money earned during her short-lived waitressing career, and that had been left over from her grandmother\u2019s trust fund. It had lasted longer than expected after she had scrimped and saved, going without a lot of things in order to keep a roof over her head. She had worked three separate jobs, until she had been forced to concede that she wasn\u2019t doing herself or her unborn baby much good. So eventually she\u2019d had to sell her car and put some of the money down as a deposit on the small flat that she and Kayla had been still living in when Rick found her again. The money from the car and the rings had kept her comfortably afloat for nearly a year. The added income from work had been used for food and rent. The car and rings had paid for the extras and had helped with the medical bills as well as with feeding and clothing Kayla.</p> <p>\u201cIt took me that long to grasp that our marriage was well and truly over,\u201d she admitted shamefully. \u201cIt took four long months before I\u2014at long last\u2014accepted that I couldn\u2019t continue living my life in limbo. I needed a place to stay, someplace that would be good for both the baby and me. I also knew that I would need medical care soon and some sort of financial cushion for a month or so after giving birth. I didn\u2019t want to abandon Kayla for work mere days after giving birth to her. I wanted to spend some time with her.\u201d He stared at her in silence for a long time, and she wet her lips nervously, not really knowing what to expect. Not even sure that he\u2019d caught half of what she\u2019d said. She had spoken a little too quickly, without really giving any thought to his deafness.</p><p>\u201cI expected you to use the money in our mutual account, or to use your credit card. I was hoping that you would because it would have helped me track you down. I nearly went crazy wondering how the hell you were taking care of yourself. Why didn\u2019t you use the money, Bronwyn?\u201d he asked hoarsely, clearly staggered by her words. \u201cSurely your health and the baby\u2019s welfare meant more than your stubborn pride?\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him in mute shock.</p><p>\u201cI used my own money, Bryce,\u201d she repeated with a shrug, knowing that the money had been a pittance compared to what he had. But at least it had been hers. \u201cIn my old account.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat account?\u201d he asked blankly, and she frowned.</p><p>\u201cThe account I had before we married,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cYou still had that account?\u201d He practically exploded, and she winced, understanding how that must look to him. \u201cAfter two years of marriage, you still had a bank account in your maiden name? What the hell was that about, Bronwyn? Your escape clause?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly,\u201d she scoffed. \u201cIt barely had enough in it to see me through the first month. I just never got around to closing it, that\u2019s all. And besides, you have no right to get all self-righteous with me over it. You had cut me off so completely I\u2019d assumed\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat? That I\u2019d be happy to let you and the baby starve to death or wind up homeless?\u201d he interrupted fiercely, and her mouth opened and then closed again as she tried to gather her thoughts. Yes, she should probably have used the money. When she thought back to all the unnecessary suffering that she had endured, it seemed stupid now, but at the time she\u2019d been trying to prove a point. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBryce,\u201d she tried to find a way to explain her decision to him and drew a complete blank. \u201cAfter four months of constant and inexplicable rejection, I gave up on trying to reach you. By that point I didn\u2019t think that you deserved to have the baby or me in your life. I wanted to move on and couldn\u2019t do so with your money. I needed to do it on my own, without being beholden to the man who had made it clear that he didn\u2019t want anything to do with us. I didn\u2019t feel entitled to your money after making that decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t feel entitled to it?\u201d Bryce latched onto those words, obviously dismissing the rest of what she had said. \u201cTo the father of your child\u2019s money? I don\u2019t even know how to respond to that, Bronwyn. You may not have felt entitled to it, but Kayla certainly was, and is, entitled to it. You could have set aside your pettiness and considered her in all of this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh please just stop throwing Kayla in my face. I did everything I could for her. I gave her the best I could afford after you kicked us out. How was I supposed to know you\u2019d have this turnaround where the baby was concerned? As far as I knew, you didn\u2019t want her and didn\u2019t think that she was entitled to anything you had. She didn\u2019t want for anything. Her clothes may not have had designer tags and her toys may have been secondhand, but my baby was well loved and well taken care of. Don\u2019t you dare imply anything else!\u201d More interminably silent staring from him, but she refused to lower her eyes, refused to be intimidated or cowed by him. Instead she met his inscrutable gaze head-on, with chin tilted defiantly, eyes sparking, and fists clenched. She looked like a feral cat ready to defend herself and her baby against any and all threats.</p><p>\u201cWhat time are you meeting Alice?\u201d The question threw her completely, and she blinked in astonishment, surprised and relieved that he had let it drop. She checked her watch.</p> <p>\u201cIn about half an hour,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cYou will come back?\u201d</p><p>Not understanding the question, she merely stared at him confusedly for a few moments.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t run off again?\u201d he rephrased, and she reeled in shock at the depth of vulnerability and insecurity his question had revealed.</p> <p>\u201cUh . . . n-no. Mikayla . . .\u201d was all she managed, and he nodded shortly, realizing that she would never leave without her daughter.</p><p>\u201cIf not for Mikayla . . .\u201d He seemed to ask the question before he could stop himself, and in doing so, clearly revealed a lot more than he had ever intended to reveal. \u201cWould you come back?\u201d She hesitated, her eyes lowered as she pondered the question, and seeing the uncertainty on her face, Bryce made a slight movement with his hand.</p><p>\u201cForget it,\u201d he snapped, before she could even think about formulating a response. \u201cIt was a stupid question, and it\u2019s really not that important. As long as you don\u2019t leave with my daughter, I don\u2019t give a damn what you do.\u201d Somehow the words sounded hollow and untrue, ringing with bravado and not much conviction. They avoided each other\u2019s eyes\u2014each afraid of the truth they might spy in the other\u2019s gaze.</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d she muttered evasively, getting up from the chair. He jumped up too and caught her arm to halt her progress.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d She stood quietly in his grasp, her eyes searching his harsh features warily. He looked moody and uncertain, not at all sure of what he wanted to say or even why he\u2019d halted her progress.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to go by yourself,\u201d he said, almost reluctantly. \u201cI want one of the security team to go with.\u201d Bronwyn frowned at that. She had always hated the discreet security detail that had followed them just about everywhere after they had first gotten married and had complained about it so much that he had cut her personal detail down to one supposedly unobtrusive guard to keep her happy. Bronwyn had agreed to the compromise because the one guy had been better than a team, but she had never felt comfortable with what she had always felt was a blatant display of wealth.</p> <p>\u201cBryce, I don\u2019t want to have some gorilla following me around all afternoon,\u201d she snapped, and his lips tightened.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask Cal to take care of the matter personally.\u201d Cal was his head of security and Bronwyn had always liked the quiet man who read Shakespearean sonnets in his spare time. She hadn\u2019t really seen him since her return. She was relieved to learn that he still worked for Bryce since she had feared that she might have gotten him into trouble after instructing him to take that fateful night off two years ago. She had wanted a private and romantic evening with her husband and had dismissed the entire staff. She knew that it was probably one of the only reasons she had been able to disappear so completely. Cal had left only a skeleton staff on duty that night. Her personal guard, not expecting her to leave the house that night, had also been given the night off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad Cal still works for you,\u201d she said, all the heat fleeing from her voice and expression.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been acting as my personal guard,\u201d Bryce said before making an odd sound in the back of his throat. \u201cYou still have my numbers right?\u201d he continued hesitantly, and she nodded again. \u201cIf you need anything, or if you feel ill, call me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBryce.\u201d She smiled reassuringly up into his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m fine, but in the unlikely event of that status quo changing, I\u2019ll be sure to give you a call.\u201d His eyes frosted over.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mock me, Bronwyn,\u201d he said coldly, and she shook her head, alarmed that he had misread her humor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t,\u201d she assured gently, lifting her hand to cup his jaw. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine, but I promise to call you if I feel ill.\u201d He stepped away from her soft hand, leaving it hovering in midair. He continued to look down at her for a few long moments.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell Cal to meet you in the garage. Let him do the driving,\u201d he said bossily before swivelling on his heel and leaving the room. Bronwyn sighed despondently and stared after him for one long, wistful moment before straightening her shoulders and leaving too.</p><p>Alice met her at the restaurant entrance with a warm hug and a smile. Her mischievously sparkling eyes traveled past Bronwyn\u2019s shoulder to where Cal stood hovering in the background, before tossing a conspiratorial glance back over her own narrow shoulder. When Bronwyn saw a large man, similarly dressed in black suit and dark glasses standing a little off to the side, desperately striving to look \u201cunobtrusive\u201d behind Alice, she laughed in genuine amusement.</p><p>\u201cAll the cool kids have one these days,\u201d Alice wisecracked cheerfully, her expression so comical that it set Bronwyn off again.</p> <p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Tristan?\u201d Bronwyn asked Alice after their initial warm greetings.</p><p>\u201cI told Pierre that this was a ladies\u2019 afternoon and as such he had to take Tristan to the office with him.\u201d She grinned. \u201cHe was a bit reluctant. He loves having the baby around, but Tristan has this nasty habit of chewing important documents. Pierre still shudders every time he thinks of a certain document that got gummed just minutes before he had to hand it back to the legal department. The way he tells it, he had no option but to give it back as is. He made no comment about the drool and as such none of the legal team had the courage to say anything either. They merely retyped everything before sending it off.\u201d She laughed conspiratorially.</p><p>\u201cAccording to Pierre it was \u2018damned embarrassing.\u2019\u201d She imitated her husband\u2019s voice and accent perfectly, and Bronwyn\u2019s grin widened appreciatively. \u201cApparently he has an important meeting today, but I hardly ever get time to myself, so while he may grumble, he doesn\u2019t really mind. In fact, he\u2019ll never admit it but he gets a total thrill out of having his son to himself for part of the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I still feel a bit guilty about leaving Bryce with Kayla,\u201d Bronwyn admitted. \u201cHe\u2019s been remarkable with her, but I feel like he\u2019s been doing all the work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Alice interrupted coldly. \u201cYou have been doing all the work for the last two years, and you\u2019ve paid for it with your health. It\u2019s time for Bryce to put in some hours.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you can\u2019t tell me he\u2019s not enjoying this time with her. He\u2019s getting to know his daughter, and from what I could see last night, he\u2019s totally in love with her.\u201d</p><p>Bronwyn nodded with slight smile.</p><p>\u201cSo no more guilt; just enjoy yourself. As far as I can tell, you haven\u2019t had too much fun over the last two years.\u201d</p><p>Bronwyn\u2019s smile faded, and Alice shrugged, the gesture so Gallic, it could only have rubbed off on her from her husband.</p><p>\u201cI know nothing about your situation, Bronwyn,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cBut Pierre\u2019s version of events, definitely gleaned from his friend, was so one-sided that I\u2019d always vowed to reserve judgment until I met you. And there seems to be a whole lot that Bryce left out when he told Pierre his story. I mean, he had certainly never told Pierre that you were pregnant. I can\u2019t tell you how shocked Pierre was when he learned that you were back in Bryce\u2019s life and with a child!\u201d</p> <p>Bronwyn blinked stupidly at that. Pierre hadn\u2019t known about her pregnancy? She had a sudden vivid flashback of Rick in her room at the hospital. It hadn\u2019t really sunk in at the time; she had been frightened, panicky, and floating on a medicated cloud, but her brother-in-law had looked startled at Bryce\u2019s first mention of a child. How could Bryce not have told Rick or Pierre about their baby? Had he told his \u201ccrack\u201d team of private investigators? It was a bizarre detail to leave out. If he really wanted to find her, why wouldn\u2019t he have told anybody about her pregnancy? Surely it would have made his search easier. Granted, some instinct had urged her to use her maternal grandmother\u2019s maiden name over the last two years, just in case Bryce decided that he wanted her baby and not her. It had been bothersome because she\u2019d had to keep changing doctors and clinics; nobody would have believed her \u201cforgotten ID\u201d story twice.</p><p>\u201cBronwyn?\u201d Alice\u2019s voice seemed to come from a great distance away, and Bronwyn had a hard time focusing on Alice again. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t he have told Pierre or Rick about the baby?\u201d she mused aloud, and Alice frowned</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good question,\u201d Alice murmured. \u201cBut one that only Bryce can provide the answer to.\u201d Bronwyn nodded absently but found it hard to focus on anything else for the rest of the afternoon. She enrolled in the sign language classes after lunch. The clinic offered afternoon and evening classes, and Bronwyn opted to attend a day class once a week. She and Alice also arranged a standing lunch date on the day that she would attend the class.</p><p>\u201cSo every Tuesday? Same time and place?\u201d the other woman double-checked as they said their good-byes a couple of hours later. \u201cAnd next time, let\u2019s keep the husbands out of the conversation!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry if I seemed a little distracted,\u201d Bron apologized quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s just . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it, you and Bryce obviously still have a great deal to work out.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p>The house was in chaos when Bronwyn returned home half an hour later. Kayla was screaming her head off in the den while Bryce held her writhing little body in his arms as he frantically tried to soothe her. Celeste stood to the side, wringing her hands nervously, a concerned look on her plain face.</p><p>\u201cOh my God! What\u2019s going on here?\u201d Kayla\u2019s crying worsened when she heard her mother\u2019s voice. She managed to pull herself out of her father\u2019s arms and launched herself toward her mother, her unsteady gait nearly sending her off balance.</p><p>\u201cMummy! Kayla ouch! Kayla ouch, Mummy!\u201d Bronwyn sank to her knees, and her heart dropped like a stone when she registered the genuine fear and pain on her little girl\u2019s face. As the child crept into her mother\u2019s open arms and snuggled against her chest, Bronwyn allowed her furious eyes to meet Bryce\u2019s. His face had closed up like a shutter, a remote look in his eyes as he stood watching them, his hands thrust into his trouser pockets.</p> <p>\u201cWhat did you do to her?\u201d she hissed, her maternal instincts on full alert. \u201cI trusted you to look after her and I come back to this?\u201d Kayla had stopped her hysterical sobbing and was hiccupping into Bronwyn\u2019s chest, her tense little body relaxing as she clung to the familiar comfort her mother represented. Bryce\u2019s shadowed eyes revealed absolutely no emotion; his clenched jaw the only visible sign of his tension. She got up, Kayla in her arms, and advanced toward him, a stalking lioness intent on protecting her cub.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened here?\u201d</p><p>His eyes remained level but he refused to say a word.</p><p>\u201cBryce, answer me! She never cries like this unless she\u2019s hurt. How did she get hurt?\u201d</p><p>His eyes flickered a little, as he cast an involuntary look down at the little girl who was staring up at him with huge, tear-drenched blue eyes. Her thumb was propped in her mouth and her breath still hitched. Bronwyn glanced over her daughter\u2019s little body, doing a damage assessment. Her eyes detected no visible signs of injury until she reached one plump little bare foot. Her big toe was bleeding and looked somewhat swollen. Bronwyn made a soft sound of dismay and lifted the foot to inspect it more closely. Fortunately the damage seemed minimal, and judging from Kayla\u2019s ever-lessening sniffles, the immediate shock of pain had worn off already. As the haze of panic dissipated, Bronwyn began to recognize that the damage she had done by storming blindly into the fray may have been a lot worse than the injury to Kayla\u2019s toe. She had shown an appalling lack of trust by assuming Bryce had been responsible for the toddler\u2019s injury, and she was beginning to feel like an overprotective fool.</p> <p>\u201cBryce,\u201d she began hesitantly, taking a step toward where he stood. He was as still and remote as a statue. He ignored her and swung on his heel to leave the room abruptly. Bronwyn made a dismayed little sound, and Kayla, her pain mostly forgotten already, dragged her thumb from her mouth to add her own opinion.</p><p>\u201cDaddy go bye-bye,\u201d she observed solemnly before resting her head on Bronwyn\u2019s shoulder and sticking her thumb back into her mouth.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Bronwyn whispered, burying her face in her daughter\u2019s silky curls. \u201cDaddy\u2019s gone away.\u201d But that wasn\u2019t entirely true; he hadn\u2019t left the house, she had heard his study door slam and knew that he was probably brooding in there. She knew that she would have to get to the bottom of things sooner rather than later and also had the sinking feeling that she was the one who would have to make serious amends. She glanced over at the appalled Celeste and nodded down at the drowsy little girl in her arms.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of her toe,\u201d she said hoarsely, and Celeste mumbled that she\u2019d be in the kitchen. Bronwyn fussed over Kayla for a while, her mind on Bryce while she kissed the toe of her now-giggling baby all better and placed a cute Finding Nemo Band-Aid on the tiny cut. Kayla\u2019s eyelids started to droop after half an hour of cuddling and playing with her mother\u2014it was way past time for her afternoon nap. Bronwyn carried her to the housekeeper in the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cCeleste, would you mind . . .\u201d She left the question unfinished, and Celeste nodded immediately and bustled forward to take an unprotesting Kayla into her arms. Bronwyn dropped an affectionate kiss on the sleepy child\u2019s forehead before hurrying out of the room toward Bryce\u2019s study. With each heavy step she took, she felt more and more like Daniel preparing to beard the lion\u2019s den. When she reached the ominously shut study door, she paused to listen but couldn\u2019t hear a sound coming from behind the door. She cautiously knocked on the solid wood before berating herself for her thoughtless action. Now she faced an unfamiliar dilemma: did she just enter? Or did she wait until he eventually came out on his own? She regarded the suddenly insurmountable obstacle of the door cautiously before deciding to take the bull by the horns and open the door.</p><p>Bryce sat behind his huge desk, with his elbows resting on the gleaming wooden surface and his face buried in his hands. His large shoulders were shaking slightly. He looked terribly vulnerable, and in that moment Bronwyn felt like a voyeur of the worst kind. She cleared her throat to alert him of her presence and then swore softly beneath her breath when she realized that the gesture was as futile as her knock had been.</p> <p>\u201cBryce . . .\u201d Again she swore, feeling like a complete idiot, and hesitantly took a few steps toward him, lifting her hand to his shoulder in the process. He leaped out of the chair like a scalded cat and swore furiously. He glared at her, looking a bit a shaken and a lot furious.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sneak up on me,\u201d he berated hoarsely. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d she protested, shocked by the near violence of his reaction. \u201cI knocked but . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knocked?\u201d His voice dripped with derision. \u201cI can\u2019t hear, damn it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what was I supposed to do, then?\u201d she responded defensively.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a doorbell,\u201d he informed, calming down marginally, and she stared at him in confusion.</p> <p>\u201cA doorbell? But how . . .\u201d her question trailed off when he pointed toward the lamp on his desk.</p><p>\u201cThe lamp is rigged to flicker when the bell rings. It works for both the front door and the study door. Two flickers for outside, one for inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. That\u2019s quite clever,\u201d she murmured, impressed by the ingenious device and feeling like a complete idiot for not realizing sooner that the flickering lights that she had absently noticed intermittently since her return were not the result of an electrical fault as she had assumed.</p><p>\u201cClever, yes.\u201d He smiled humorlessly and practically sneered the words. \u201cIt\u2019s a common-enough device for the deaf. There are so many ways to make our lives as convenient as possible, clever little toys that light up and vibrate, tablet computers and smart phones with face-to-face call capabilities, SMSes and various other little gadgets designed to ease my life. Yet not one of these clever little toys would ever be able to alert me to the fact that my little girl is standing right behind me, trying to get my attention, not one of them could prevent me from turning around and treading on her before I\u2019m able to stop myself.\u201d Oh God! After her initial panic at finding Kayla in floods of tears and obvious pain, she had suspected that it might be something like this. Of course it was an accident, something that Bryce would tear himself up over, a situation that she had worsened with her stupid overreaction. His eyes were tormented, and she swallowed back a sob as she cupped his jaw in her slender hands.</p><p>\u201cBryce,\u201d she whispered, her eyes liquid with regret and sympathy. He saw nothing but the sympathy and mistook it for pity. He jerked away from her and turned his back on her.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she moaned softly, not willing to allow him to close himself off when he was clearly in pain. She stepped around him and forced him to meet her eyes.</p><p>\u201cMikayla and I are going to have to learn not to sneak up on you then,\u201d she told him firmly. \u201cYou are not at fault here, Bryce, it was an accident!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve changed your tune rather quickly,\u201d he mocked, and she flushed.</p><p>\u201cI overreacted,\u201d she conceded. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have gone off the deep end like that. I know that you would never intentionally hurt our daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIntentionally or not, I did hurt her,\u201d he pointed out harshly. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t promise that it won\u2019t happen again in the future. And she\u2014she\u2019s frightened of me now. I don\u2019t think . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a baby, Bryce,\u201d Bron pointed out firmly. \u201cShe was shocked and in pain, but she\u2019ll soon forget. Children are resilient and have a much larger capacity for forgiveness than we do. She has also learned her lesson, and I doubt she\u2019ll be coming up behind you without warning you in some way in the future. One thing about your daughter\u201d\u2014she smiled fondly\u2014\u201cshe\u2019s a fast learner!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe was crying so much,\u201d he remembered in a shaken voice. \u201cI couldn\u2019t make her stop! Her little face was so sad and confused. I felt like a monster.\u201d</p><p>She took a step closer to him, her heart going out to him.</p><p>\u201cOh, Bryce,\u201d she began, not sure how to make this better. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need your pity,\u201d he snarled, as defensive and dangerous as a wounded animal. Bronwyn blinked, his abrupt mood swing throwing her completely off guard.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t pity you,\u201d she denied, placing one tentative hand on his forearm, but he shrugged her off and signed something at her, glaring wildly while he did.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said helplessly, and he responded with another mutinous flurry of sign that left her completely adrift. His eyes were burning with anger and some other emotion that she could not define.</p><p>\u201cBryce, please . . .\u201d she begged, not sure why it mattered to her that she comfort him. \u201cDon\u2019t shut me out like this.\u201d He said something else, again with his hands, and then quite abruptly turned his back on her. Once again shutting her out as completely as he could. She sobbed a little before lifting a clenched fist to her lips and biting down on her knuckles, not sure how to deal with this. She stared at his broad, stiff back through burning eyes. She refused to let him do this.</p><p>Bryce had always been much too good at shutting her out. After a bad day at work, he used to closet himself in his study and refuse to speak to her about it until after it was resolved. She had never told him how much that had hurt her, and the one time she had dared mention it, he had quite condescendingly informed her that she wouldn\u2019t understand anyway and not to worry about it. That had made her so furious, but she had let it slide. She had let a lot of things slide back then, in an effort not to upset Bryce. But she wasn\u2019t that silly, spineless girl anymore, and she was determined not to let him shut her out again, not this time. Not when it was so important to their future as a functioning family. She threw back her shoulders resolutely before stepping around him again to meet his glare with a ferocious one of her own. She chose to ignore the scorching anger in his eyes.</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t allow you to turn your back on me this time, Bryce. And I refuse to leave until you acknowledge me and we talk about this!\u201d she told him resolutely, and his lips tightened as he signed something particularly vicious looking back at her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying,\u201d Bronwyn all but screamed in frustration, and he smiled, a feral showing of teeth that bore no resemblance to his normally beautiful smile. He signed again and quite abruptly grabbed her upper arms and kissed her. Hard! His tongue forced its way into the tender interior of her mouth, assaulting and insulting rather than caressing and loving. There was nothing remotely affectionate in the embrace, nothing but contempt and anger.</p><p>\u201cI said,\u201d he told her scornfully, when he lifted his head to end the vile kiss. \u201cThat since you refuse to leave, you might as well make yourself useful!\u201d</p><p>God, what on Earth had made her think she could deal with this man on an equal footing? Whenever she tried, he moved the goalposts and left her floundering. She couldn\u2019t take him on and win; she couldn\u2019t even hope to try. More fool her, for thinking that she could.</p><p>\u201cNot so eager to stick around now, are you?\u201d he taunted when she took a step back. \u201cThen again, you never were any good at seeing things through, were you? Important things like your studies and our marriage.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who abandoned our marriage, Bryce. And then you compounded your sins by believing, and telling, the most despicable lies about me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you ever stop singing this same pathetic tune over and over again? Your self-righteous indignation does not sit well with me, Bronwyn. This air of injured dignity is wearing thin and getting on my nerves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince we\u2019re apparently \u2018forced\u2019 to make a life together, don\u2019t you think we should try to set our differences aside and be a family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s be a family Bronwyn,\u201d he muttered smoothly. \u201cLet\u2019s be man and wife.\u201d He took hold of her thin upper arms again and dragged her toward him, securing her lips in another kiss. This time the kiss contained all the elements the former had lacked\u2014heat, sensation, and desire. Bronwyn moaned in despair, but his mouth captured the desolate little sound and swallowed it hungrily. His lips were soft but insistent against hers; they opened her mouth with the skill that she had always been unable to resist, and his tongue flowed in, skilfully subduing any protest she may have made. But Bronwyn was beyond protest, hadn\u2019t even thought of protesting. She knew that this wouldn\u2019t solve any of their problems\u2014would probably worsen them if anything\u2014but she had always melted at the first sign of tenderness from him, and this mocking kiss was so humiliatingly tender.</p><p>His hands moved up to cup her face, thumbs caressing her jaw as he coaxed her to open up a little more, to respond despite herself and, God help her, did she respond. She kissed him back, parried with his tongue, and ran restless, seeking hands over his shoulders, his neck, and his face. He made a satisfied little sound when her questing hands burrowed beneath his T-shirt and found the silky hot skin beneath the cotton. Somehow, together, they managed to rid him of the T-shirt without once losing contact. Her blouse soon followed suit. Before she knew it, the rest of their clothes were off, and they were skin-to-skin, with nothing between them but a fine sheen of sweat. He closed his hands around her waist and lifted her up. Bronwyn immediately knew what he wanted and obliged him by wrapping her long legs around his waist and her arms around his neck.</p> <p>He staggered toward his desk, her weight throwing him a tad off balance, but his mouth never lost contact with hers. There was a terrible clatter as he swept stationery from the surface of the desk, nearly sending his computer monitor toppling over the side in the process. He lifted his lips from hers as he laid her down on the desk and plunged into her in the same fluid motion.</p><p>Someone sobbed in relief. Bronwyn didn\u2019t know which of them it was, but she suspected it was Bryce. He rested there for a while, bearing her down with his weight. He felt big, hot, and hard inside of her and showered her face with worshipful little kisses as he began to move. Her legs had fallen away from his waist and now dangled over the edge of the desk with her thighs spread wide to accommodate his powerful thrusts. His hands were flat against the desk on either side of her head as he focused all of his formidable attention on their mutual pleasure.</p><p>He was starting to groan, and his long, smooth strokes were becoming choppier and less controlled. Bronwyn drew her legs up and wrapped them around his waist again, lifting her bottom from the desk to allow him easier and deeper access. He lowered his head to her breasts, licking, sucking, and kissing them hungrily. One of his hands dropped down to where their bodies were joined and he touched her in a way that had always driven her wild. This time was no exception\u2014she grunted in surprise, breathing his name, before squealing with pleasure as she shuddered, then shuddered again and fell apart all around him.</p><p>He moaned, moving his hands to her slender hips to hold her steady as he focused fiercely on her contorted face. Sweat was beading on his brow as he slammed into her. Bronwyn, who was just descending from her climax, tensed up again as yet another powerful orgasm crept up on her.</p><p>Bryce\u2019s back arched and he lifted her clear off the desk with his frantic plunges. He held her close as he shuddered violently and poured himself into her, as they came simultaneously. They cried out their pleasure and desperately clung to each other as the world receded. Bryce collapsed onto her and she briefly bore his full weight before he braced his hands on the desk and relieved her of some of the burden. His eyes were searching her face almost desperately, and Bronwyn wasn\u2019t sure what he was hoping to find.</p><p>He kissed her sweetly and the part of him that was still buried deep inside of her pulsed lazily in reaction to the gentle caress. Bronwyn gasped as she felt the movement and wondered if they could do it again so soon after the mind-shattering bliss of just minutes before. But he ended the kiss abruptly and lifted himself off and out of her without any warning. The suddenness of the separation left her feeling ridiculously vulnerable. He swore, his face darkening with anger.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t use any protection.\u201d She flinched at the reminder of how much he would loathe getting her pregnant again. But after the last time, getting pregnant by Bryce wasn\u2019t exactly high on her to-do list either.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on the pill,\u201d she admitted huskily. \u201cI asked the doctor for a prescription last week during my checkup.\u201d She flinched when he laughed scathingly.</p><p>\u201cDo forgive me if I choose to doubt you, my dear. We both know how very unreliable you are when it comes to taking care of the birth control,\u201d he mocked, and she trembled violently at the derision in his voice and the contempt on his face. He gave her one last piercing stare before dropping the matter.</p><p>\u201cDid I hurt you?\u201d he asked almost impersonally as he hunted around for his boxers. Her reply obviously held little interest for him because he had his back to her. She didn\u2019t bother responding but sat up, humiliated by the position she found herself in\u2014laid out on his desk, naked, and spread out for his pleasure. She was covered in a mixture of their perspiration and other fluids and smelled of sex and sweat. She felt used and cheap and her cheeks burned with mortification. He couldn\u2019t have made his disdain for her any clearer, and Bronwyn was disgusted with herself for falling into his arms so easily every time. She was a little shell-shocked by her unforgivable stupidity and could barely gather her scattered thoughts. She just wanted out of the room and away from Bryce but for some reason she couldn\u2019t seem to figure out how to do that.</p> <p>She stood up and crossed one arm over her naked breasts and used the other hand to cup the wispy triangle of curls at the juncture of her thighs in a classic pose of feminine shame.</p><p>When Bryce looked up and saw her he was struck as still as a statue. Her tear-filled eyes were darting frantically around the room, searching for her scattered clothing. He had dragged on his boxers by now and urgently started hunting for her things, hating the trapped and desperate look in her eyes. He eventually found her blouse and handed it to her, but she didn\u2019t move. She looked almost catatonic and Bryce swallowed down an irrational surge of panic. He helped her into the blouse and buttoned it clumsily, but she looked even more vulnerable with only her lower half exposed. She ducked her head and hid her face behind her heavy fall of hair. He hunted around but couldn\u2019t seem to find her panties. Instead he turned up a dainty bra and her creased trousers. Deciding that the latter would do, he helped her into them, hunkering down to physically lift her feet, one at a time, into the trouser legs. The position brought his face level with the fine curls at her center, but her very nakedness made her seem even more defenceless and in need of his protection.</p><p>He eventually managed to get her all zipped and buttoned up, and when he looked into her face he saw that her lips were moving and the tears that had been threatening had spilled over. He gripped her arms urgently, hating the sight of her tears. He focused on her lips and was able to discern that she was saying the same thing over and over again.</p><p>You keep punishing me . . .</p><p>Bryce acknowledged that fact to himself. He did keep punishing her, but what she didn\u2019t know was that he was punishing himself as well. He hated seeing her like this, and he hated the guilt that burned away at his insides like acid with every reluctant tear that she shed. He kept telling himself that she deserved it but it was getting so damned hard to keep convincing himself of that fact. He lifted a hand to her face but she flinched away from him and he glowered, hating the reaction. He had never physically hurt her, he had always taken great care not to hurt her, and seeing her flinch away from him like he was the monster he so dreaded becoming, had the same visceral effect on him as a punch to the gut. He gingerly wrapped his arms around her and tugged her against his chest. She was as stiff as a board and refused to relax in his embrace. Eventually realizing that she was probably emotionally drained, he lifted her into his arms and rather awkwardly managed to open the door and carry her upstairs to her bedroom. Thankfully, Celeste and Kayla were nowhere in sight. He placed her onto the soft bed and knelt in front of her, trying to catch her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019d just admit it,\u201d he said. She lifted her dull eyes to his, seeming to register his presence at last and frowned in confusion.</p><p>\u201cAdmit what?\u201d She looked confused, and he gritted his teeth as he tried to maintain his temper.</p><p>\u201cAdmit that you were at the scene of my accident and that you lied about trying to reach me. I could try to forgive you and we could start rebuilding our relationship. Just be honest, Bronwyn.\u201d She sighed tiredly, defeat weighing heavily on her shoulders. She shifted her eyes again and shrugged, looking like someone who just wanted to be left alone and would do anything to achieve that end.</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want, Bryce, then I confess to being guilty of everything that you accused me of. I stood beside that road and watched you suffer before walking away. I never tried to contact you; I preferred to struggle along with no money, no home, and rapidly deteriorating health.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t try, and fail, to reach you just after Kayla was born either, when I was so ill I could barely hold the phone, when I was terrified I would die and she would be left alone. I clung to my stubborn pride and quite selfishly never once thought about what was best for you or our daughter.\u201d She shaped the words so clearly, he had absolutely no difficulty understanding her. It was what he had wanted, what he believed to be true, a wholesale admission of guilt, but it did not sit well with him and it certainly didn\u2019t feel right. He wasn\u2019t quite sure how to proceed from here and gently pushed her down until she was lying back on the bed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou need to rest,\u201d he said as gently as he could, but he was an inaccurate judge of his own tone of voice at the best of times, and from the way she flinched, he suspected that his words had emerged a lot harsher than he had intended. Still she obeyed him and lay unresisting, looking utterly drained of any desire to fight him anymore. He tugged the covers up over her unmoving body and kissed her forehead tenderly before standing up. He hovered uncertainly, feeling faintly ridiculous in nothing but his black cotton boxers.</p><p>\u201cTry to get some sleep. Don\u2019t worry about Kayla. I\u2019ll see to her dinner and get her to bed . . .\u201d He seemed to be rambling now and Bronwyn was confused by his uncertainty. \u201cI\u2019ll bring her up to say good night later. Things will get better now, Bron,\u201d he vowed in an awkward rush, but Bronwyn refused to acknowledge his impulsive promise. \u201cYou\u2019ll see. They\u2019ll get better.\u201d</p><p>Well, things certainly felt better when she woke up the following morning. She felt warm and cherished and soon realized that it was because she was being cradled in Bryce\u2019s arms with her back pressed to his warm chest. It was only the second time she found herself waking up beside him since her return, and after the events of the last twenty-four hours, she felt more than a little ambivalent about his presence in her bed. He had one arm wrapped around her waist with his hand cradled between her breasts, and the other arm was tucked beneath her head. One of his muscled thighs was squeezed between her own slender thighs. Against her better judgment, Bronwyn felt safe, secure, and almost cherished. She felt his warm and steady breath feathering against the vulnerable nape of her neck, and she fought back a little shiver of pleasure. She slowly became aware of the fact that they were both naked\u2014and vaguely recalled Bryce brusquely helping her out of her clothes sometime during the night. The scorching hot length of his erection was pressing up against the small of her back. She immediately tensed.</p><p>\u201cRelax.\u201d His voice sounded like the contented purr of a cat and had the exact opposite effect of relaxing her. \u201cI\u2019m not going to jump you this morning. We need to talk.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have nothing to say to you,\u201d she responded mutinously, safe in the knowledge that he could not hear her or see her lips.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d he surprised her by demanding, and she tensed even further. He turned her resisting body to face him as if she weighed no more than a feather, but she kept her gaze glued to his jaw. \u201cI know you said something . . . I could feel the vibration in your chest!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked what you wanted to talk about,\u201d she lied, meeting his eyes. He looked unconvinced, and his eyes seethed with frustration, but he tamped it down determinedly.</p><p>\u201cUs . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we\u2019d said all that needed saying last night,\u201d she responded. \u201cI\u2019m a liar and you\u2019re the victim of my vindictive and cruel nature.\u201d He chose to ignore her sarcasm.</p> <p>\u201cI want to know what you meant last night when you said that you were terrified that you would die,\u201d he probed softly, watching her face carefully. They were lying so close together that it was difficult to conceal the smallest emotion from him.</p><p>\u201cThere were complications.\u201d She shrugged casually. \u201cIt was a difficult pregnancy, worsened by the fact that I was . . . malnourished.\u201d How humiliating it was to admit that. She lowered her eyes again, embarrassed by her inability to take care of herself. \u201cI was underweight and weak by the time I went into labor. It was a long, intense labor, and because my body had been deprived of the vitamins it needed during the pregnancy, it was ill-equipped to deal with the . . . trauma . . . of an extended labor. There was some tearing, I lost a lot of blood and went into shock. I remember them asking for the name and number of my next of kin right after Kayla was born.\u201d She felt moisture on her cheeks and was appalled to discover that she was crying silently. God, she was so sick of crying all the time, but it was so difficult to recall the fear and absolute loneliness of that moment without succumbing to emotion. \u201cI was so scared. I just wanted to hold my baby. I wanted to be sure that she was okay. The doctors all looked so grim behind their masks; they told me that she was fine but nobody would show me.\u201d She felt a rough thumb wiping away the tears on her cheeks and shut her eyes at the gruff gentleness. She swallowed bravely before continuing. \u201cOne of the last things I remember before everything went dark was begging to see my baby, and then a doctor calling my name and swearing. I remember him swearing because he sounded so angry and so concerned that he reminded me of you. For a split second I thought it was you! And I was so happy . . .\u201d She could feel him trembling now, as if chilled to the bone, but for some reason she couldn\u2019t seem to stop the flow of words. He had asked, he had wanted to know, and she was not going to sugar coat it for him. She cleared her throat hoarsely before continuing.</p><p>\u201cThey told me my heart stopped . . . twice. Of course, I don\u2019t remember it at all. I just woke up to the sound of Kayla\u2019s crying. It took so much strength to turn my head but . . .\u201d She smiled radiantly up into his face, her tears blinding her to his expression. \u201cShe was the most beautiful thing I\u2019d ever seen. So perfect and so healthy, and in that moment I knew that I would do anything to keep her safe!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBronwyn . . .\u201d Bryce\u2019s throat was tight with emotion, and he struggled to get the words out. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall you?\u201d She completed the question and gazed at him levelly. \u201cPerhaps I was stubborn . . . or stupid? Maybe I didn\u2019t love Kayla enough to want the best for her?\u201d He didn\u2019t want her truth, he had forced her into uttering the only major lie she had ever told him, and she would be damned if she ever tried to convince him of the facts again. She was tired of defending herself to a man who refused to see the truth. Well, now the truth was something that Bryce would have to discover for himself. She had given up on it and on him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he whispered painfully, his own eyes shimmering with what could only be tears. \u201cGod, I\u2019m so sorry you had to go through that on your own.\u201d</p><p>Bryce wasn\u2019t quite able to process everything he had just learned without wanting to howl in agony at the horror of it all. Her heart had stopped for God\u2019s sake! She had died and he hadn\u2019t even known about it. His beautiful, fragile Bronwyn had nearly been snatched from him forever and the knowledge was eating him up alive. His own suffering seemed almost immaterial when measured against the cripplingly painful facts that she had just revealed and yet he couldn\u2019t help thinking that if she had just stayed, come back, called him\u2014anything\u2014he could have protected her, kept her safe from harm. He ignored the shrill voice screeching at him in the back of his mind, Who would have kept her safe from you?</p><p>\u201cYou said the nurse asked you for your next of kin\u2019s contact details. Why didn\u2019t you give them my number?\u201d he asked gruffly.</p><p>\u201cOh, now why on earth would I do that?\u201d Bronwyn asked flippantly. \u201cI much preferred the thought of leaving Kayla an orphan.\u201d His brow lowered threateningly. You didn\u2019t have to be able to hear to recognize such blatant sarcasm.</p> <p>\u201cBron, now\u2019s not the time for facetiousness!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she blinked up at him innocently, forming her words carefully so that there would be no misunderstanding. \u201cI\u2019m just telling you what I believe you want to know, since it has become rather self-evident that the truth gets rejected when it doesn\u2019t suit you. What I don\u2019t get is how on earth you could marry a woman you have such a low opinion of. By now we\u2019ve established that I\u2019m foolish, fickle, cruel, and selfish! God knows what you saw in me in the first place. You must be an appalling judge of character.\u201d She disentangled herself from his arms and jumped out of bed, uncaring of her nudity. She just wanted to get away from him.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d he asked, sounding panicky.</p><p>\u201cShower,\u201d was her succinct reply.</p><p>\u201cBut we haven\u2019t finished our talk . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve said all I have to say on that particular subject.\u201d She waved her hand dismissively and turned toward the en suite.</p><p>\u201cBron,\u201d his voice was gruff with some indefinable emotion, and she turned to face him. He stared at her for a long moment, looking completely lost for words, before shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cRick and Lisa got back from their holiday last night, and I thought it would be nice to have them come by for the afternoon. I\u2019d like Rick to get to know Kayla, and I think that you and Lisa might get along.\u201d She nodded in response, part of her looking forward to seeing Rick again and the other part remembering his cold-bloodedness at the hospital when she had been ill and defenseless. She was looking forward to spending more time with his new wife though; the woman had been very kind to her in the brief moments they had shared.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be nice,\u201d she murmured before turning back toward the bathroom, and this time he let her go without protest.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>Rick, Lisa, and Rhys arrived just after one o\u2019clock. The couple was holding hands and looked tanned, healthy, and happy. Rick\u2019s greeting of Bronwyn was strained; merely a curt nod before he grinned at his older brother and immediately struck up a conversation in SASL, rather rudely excluding both Bronwyn and Lisa. The other woman shared a wry smile with Bronwyn before clasping her hand warmly and planting a totally unexpected kiss on her cheek.</p> <p>\u201cYou look so much better than the last time I saw you,\u201d she said with a friendly smile.</p><p>\u201cRest and sunshine will do that,\u201d Bron responded easily before stepping back and giving Lisa an all-encompassing once-over.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember much about you, beyond your kindness that day, but I have to say, you\u2019re looking very good too.\u201d She snuck a glance over to her expansively signing brother-in-law. \u201cI\u2019m happy the whole . . . situation with Bryce and I didn\u2019t ruin your holiday!\u201d Lisa shook her head with a smile.</p><p>\u201cRick was a bit withdrawn for a while, but Rhys and I soon dragged him out of it.\u201d She nodded down at the sleeping baby in his stroller and grinned good-naturedly.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m so relieved to hear that.\u201d Bronwyn couldn\u2019t help but respond to Lisa\u2019s warm personality. The woman was absolutely lovely. She could see how Rick fell for her so quickly.</p><p>\u201cSo where is your beautiful little girl?\u201d Lisa sent a questioning glance around the sunny patio as if expecting Kayla to pop out from some nook at any moment.</p><p>\u201cPoor little thing. Bryce was preparing her for your impending visit all morning and while she has no idea what cousins, aunts, and uncles are\u2014I think she\u2019s expecting some exotic form of animal\u2014she kept chattering on about it throughout her lunch. She wore herself out and drifted off to sleep almost immediately after completing her meal. It\u2019s for the best; she gets cranky if she doesn\u2019t have her afternoon nap. She\u2019ll be up again in an hour or two.\u201d She glanced over to where Bryce and Rick were still immersed in conversation and frowned.</p><p>\u201cCan you understand sign language?\u201d she asked quietly, and Lisa\u2019s eyes became pools of liquid sympathy.</p> <p>\u201cA little. Rick has been teaching me,\u201d she admitted softly.</p><p>\u201cWhat are they talking about?\u201d Bron wondered wistfully, and Lisa squeezed her hand again.</p><p>\u201cI think Rick is telling Bryce about his shark cage dive.\u201d She shuddered at the unpleasant recollection.</p><p>\u201cOh dear . . . Rick still does stuff like that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cApparently it was the first time he\u2019s ever gone shark cage diving. He loved it but told me that he doubts he\u2019ll do it again, now that he\u2019s experienced it. I should hope not. It gives me jitters whenever I think of him down there with all those huge great whites circling the flimsy little cage he considers protection!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll settle down a bit now that he\u2019s married with a child, I suspect,\u201d Bron stated confidently.</p><p>\u201cSure he will.\u201d Lisa rolled her eyes. \u201cOr maybe he\u2019ll simply drag Rhys and me along with him. Back when we were dating, before I got pregnant, he did a brilliant job of talking me into doing the crazy stuff with him! In fact I\u2019m pretty sure getting pregnant so soon was my body\u2019s defence mechanism kicking in to save me from Death by Crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Bron gasped, unable to picture the sweet, bookish-looking woman participating in some of the extreme sports Rick commonly did for fun.</p> <p>\u201cWell let\u2019s see: bungee jumping, parasailing, parachuting, hang-gliding.\u201d She ticked off her fingers as she itemized. \u201cNavigating in some crazy off-road race, white-water rafting . . . these are just a few of the insane things I found myself roped into doing back then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBallet recitals, operas, poetry readings, symphony orchestras, shopping for really old furniture,\u201d Rick interjected.</p><p>\u201cAntiques,\u201d Lisa inserted smoothly, smiling affectionately as her husband came over to join them.</p><p>\u201c. . . Art exhibitions,\u201d Rick continued to recite as if she hadn\u2019t interrupted, dropping an arm around his wife\u2019s narrow shoulders and angling himself so that Bryce was able to lip-read what he was saying. \u201cThese are just a few of the really boring things I have found myself participating in since getting married.\u201d</p><p>Lisa snorted and rolled her eyes again.</p> <p>\u201cAt least I don\u2019t have a thing for jumping off high mountains and out of perfectly good planes,\u201d she scoffed, and he grinned before dropping a quick kiss on her lips and whispering something in her ear.</p><p>Bronwyn watched them enviously and unconsciously found herself raising her eyes to Bryce\u2019s face. She was startled to see that he was studying her intently, and she lowered her gaze quickly but he came over to stand beside her. They stood side by side for a couple of moments, not touching, watching the younger couple whispering and giggling with each other. Bronwyn nearly jumped out of her skin when she felt the first tentative, wholly unexpected touch of his large hand in the small of her back. Her eyes flew to his impassive profile, but he kept his eyes straight ahead, watching his brother and Lisa with a slight smile playing about his lips.</p><p>His hand moved up hesitantly, until it was in the nape of her neck, beneath the thick fall of her hair and the heat of his skin singed the delicate flesh of her vulnerable neck. He massaged her soft skin gently before clearing his throat to get the younger couple\u2019s attention; they jumped apart guiltily, grinning like kids.</p><p>\u201cReady to eat?\u201d Bryce asked quietly before turning toward the patio table that was laden with delicious food and fruit. He kept a possessive hand on Bronwyn as he led her toward the table and let her go long enough to pull out a chair for her. Bronwyn glanced up at him warily before accepting the seat. He used to do things like that for her all the time in the past, unconscious acts like opening doors, helping her into coats, seating her. It was an old-world chivalry that Bronwyn had found completely charming. He hadn\u2019t done anything like it since her return, and Bronwyn realized with a pang that it was one of the small details she had forgotten, yet subconsciously missed, about him. She nodded her thanks, wondering what was behind the sudden courtesy. His hand unexpectedly lowered to her cheek and his thumb stroked her flesh briefly, but he moved away before she had any chance to react to the unexpected caress.</p><p>Baffled, Bronwyn\u2019s eyes followed his progress as he sat opposite her, next to Lisa, leaving Rick no option but to sit beside Bronwyn. Rick largely ignored her in favor of his brother and wife, leaving Bronwyn feeling snubbed and ridiculously hurt. She knew why he was behaving the way he was, knew that he was merely being loyal to his brother, whom he felt had been treated unfairly. Yet Bronwyn still couldn\u2019t help but feel almost betrayed by Rick\u2019s blatant display of hostility. By the time they were halfway through the meal, Lisa was glaring daggers at her husband, and Bryce was looking almost as strained as Bronwyn felt. Rick was either oblivious to the tension he was creating or\u2014more than likely\u2014ignoring it.</p><p>\u201cBronwyn,\u201d Bryce\u2019s quiet voice interrupted Rick\u2019s animated description of some of the more exotic sights he and Lisa had been treated to during their \u201cand baby makes three honeymoon,\u201d as he had so delightfully described the holiday. \u201cYou\u2019re not eating . . .\u201d</p> <p>Bronwyn looked down at her barely touched meal and shrugged helplessly, a bit thrown by the abrupt shift in topic.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not that hungry,\u201d she responded with a strained smile. \u201cAnd I was wrapped up in Rick\u2019s story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should eat,\u201d Bryce prompted. \u201cYou\u2019re still too thin . . .\u201d</p><p>Bronwyn snapped, instantly and utterly fed up with everything. The ridiculous untruths he believed about her, Rick\u2019s hostility, and her own weakness in both body and spirit.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s always something with you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she hissed furiously. \u201cI wasn\u2019t well spoken enough, pretty enough, graceful enough, educated enough . . . I was never good enough for you. I doubt I\u2019ll ever be good enough. No wonder you jumped at the opportunity to get rid of me,\u201d she reflected bitterly. \u201cAll you needed was an excuse, and I very conveniently provided you with one when I got pregnant. And then, to add insult to injury, you came up with that ridiculous . . .\u201d She stopped abruptly, remembering her resolve to let him muddle through the facts and find the truth for himself. She shook her head furiously, turning to a gaping Rick. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd as for you . . . How dare you sit there judging me with nothing but the so-called facts your stupid brother gave you to go on?\u201d She was so furious, hurt, and frustrated that she couldn\u2019t stop herself from clenching her fist and punching him on his arm. He winced and angled his chair away from her. \u201cI thought you were smarter and fairer than that, Rick!\u201d She got up and turned to face Lisa, who was staring up at her with an approving grin playing about her lips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered, her eyes burning with the tears she refused to shed. \u201cPlease excuse me . . .\u201d</p><p>Lisa nodded and Bronwyn turned to flee, leaving absolute silence in her wake.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Lisa drawled into the shocked silence. \u201cI think she\u2019s a little angry, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStop it, Lisa,\u201d Rick grunted irritably. \u201cThis is none of your\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it,\u201d she warned direly. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about saying it!\u201d</p><p>Rick wisely shut up.</p><p>\u201cYour behavior was atrocious, and I was so ashamed of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLisa, you don\u2019t know\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe claims that she tried to call me,\u201d Bryce interrupted the squabbling couple quietly, and Rick frowned.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore having Kayla, as little as a week after leaving me and then again after she gave birth.\u201d He knew enough to read between the lines of her sarcastic responses of that morning. \u201cShe said she tried to call me. She said she tried my cell phone, but of course that was wrecked in the accident. She also professes to have tried the house but you\u2019d given Celeste and the staff time off while I was recuperating. But then she also says that she tried to contact the office and was stonewalled by my people.\u201d</p><p>Rick gaped at him.</p><p>\u201cBronwyn tried to contact you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she claims.\u201d Bryce shrugged, trying to disguise his unease behind the careless movement. \u201cMy staff would not have given her the run-around, not unless I\u2019d given specific instructions to that effect. Something I could not have done while laid up in hospital. So she has to be lying. But why the hell does she keep telling the same lie, over and over again?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBryce,\u201d Rick looked aghast. \u201cYou did give an order to that effect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Bryce leaped to his feet at the outrageousness of the remark. \u201cWhat in God\u2019s name are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the same night as your accident. Pierre, Cooper\u201d\u2014Cooper had been Bryce\u2019s personal assistant at the time, a young and ambitious self-starter who had since moved on to bigger and better things\u2014\u201cand I were all there. You had just gotten out of surgery and you were still groggy, but when I asked you where Bronwyn was, you were very adamant that you did not want to see her or hear from her ever again. You were in so much pain and the fact that I had to write down everything I said was adding to your emotional strain. I knew that something pretty awful must have happened between the two of you. The mere fact that she wasn\u2019t at the hospital was testament enough of that, but I still figured the words were bluster and that you two would work things out, so I shrugged them off.\u201d</p><p>Bryce\u2019s face revealed absolutely no emotion as he got up from the table and dug his cell phone out of his pocket.</p><p>\u201cCall Pierre and ask him if he knows of any calls Bronwyn may have made to my office while I was recuperating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBryce . . .\u201d Rick began.</p><p>\u201cJust do it, Rick!\u201d The younger man nodded and dialed. Bryce watched his brother\u2019s face as he spoke with Pierre, unable to read his lips while he had the phone up against his ear. He kept picturing Bronwyn\u2019s tormented face as she had flung her bitter words at him. He hadn\u2019t been able to read half of what she\u2019d said to him, but he had gotten the gist of it. She actually believed he didn\u2019t think she was good enough for him? Where the hell had she gotten a demented idea like that? He was still mulling over the question when Rick disconnected his call and looked up. Bryce watched his younger brother\u2019s expression closely, anxious to know what Pierre had revealed. When Rick first spoke, Bryce was so intent on watching his brother\u2019s eyes that he missed the first few words and impatiently signed for him to start again.</p><p>\u201cPierre doesn\u2019t know of any calls Bron may have placed to the office,\u201d Rick began, and Bryce felt an overwhelming surge of despair battling with an equally large dose of anger at himself for almost believing the treacherous little bitch! Rick was still talking and it took all of Bryce\u2019s concentration to focus on his brother\u2019s lips again. \u201c. . . Does remember you categorically stating that you wanted nothing more to do with her. Like me, he didn\u2019t take the words seriously, so he placed no such order on your behalf. Pierre thinks that Cooper may not have dismissed your words as lightly. After all, Pierre is your friend and partner, and I\u2019m your brother, and unlike Cooper we had no jobs on the line.\u201d Bryce said nothing, merely stared at his brother thoughtfully for the longest time. The anger and despair was forgotten as a terrible feeling of sinking panic rapidly settled over him, and he frantically tried to figure out what to do next.</p> <p>\u201cRick,\u201d he said out loud, as carefully and concisely as he could, not wanting his brother to misunderstand his next words in the slightest way. \u201cI want you to find Cooper. I want to know if she\u2019s lying about this because . . . because . . .\u201d He couldn\u2019t bear to utter the words. His eyes slid away from Rick\u2019s, and he found himself meeting Lisa\u2019s gaze. He saw that her lips were moving and he automatically focused on them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201c. . . If she\u2019s telling the truth about trying to call you, she may well be telling the truth about everything else, right?\u201d He hid a wince as Lisa verbalized the words he had been unable to speak, and his eyes shut in horror at the mere idea of such an atrocity. God, how could he live with himself if his terrible treatment of her since her return had been unjustified? He met Rick\u2019s gaze, wondering if the misery and overwhelming dread he felt were evident in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cShe also said that she wasn\u2019t there when I had my accident. That she didn\u2019t leave me to . . .\u201d He couldn\u2019t even bring himself to say it, realizing now how ridiculous it was to believe that his soft-hearted wife would ever leave him, or anyone else for that matter, injured and alone at the scene of an accident. He sat down on the closest chair with a thump, feeling bewildered and sick to his stomach.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d he groaned. \u201cOh my God! I was so determined to blame her for this, but what if I was wrong, Rick? Do you know what that means? The things she went through on her own . . . how she struggled to make a decent life for Kayla and herself. She nearly died having our baby, and I wasn\u2019t there for her. Even if she\u2019s lying about everything, there\u2019s just no excuse for letting her go through all of that on her own!\u201d His brother put a firm hand on his shoulder, forcing Bryce to look up to meet his gaze.</p><p>\u201cCalm down, Bryce, you tried to find her, remember? Even believing what you did about her, you still tried your damnedest to find her. Let\u2019s just figure out what the truth is before you start with the self-recriminations.\u201d</p> <p>Bryce covered his face with his hands, not sure what to do next, feeling helpless and completely lost. It was a feeling he was all-too familiar with since losing his hearing, but it wasn\u2019t a feeling he would ever learn to live with. He got up abruptly, his head swimming with chaotic thoughts, his objective clear.</p><p>\u201cI have to talk with her.\u201d His eyes blindly sought out his brother and sister-in-law. \u201cI . . . excuse me.\u201d He saw Rick start to sign something but Lisa reached out and stayed his brother\u2019s hands before nodding encouragingly at Bryce.</p><p>She was on the nursery floor, playing with an active Kayla, who looked refreshed after her afternoon nap. Bronwyn had her back to the door and didn\u2019t see him at first. In fact, it was Kayla who alerted her to his presence. The little girl saw him hovering in the doorway, and her whole face lit up as she squealed excitedly.</p><p>\u201cDaddy!\u201d She toddled toward him, her chubby arms outstretched. Bryce smiled at the little girl as he swept her up into his arms, keeping his eyes on Bronwyn\u2019s slender back, noting how it tensed, before she squared her shoulders and stood up to face him. Bryce was trying to handle the little girl\u2019s effusive chatter and watch Bronwyn\u2019s face at the same time. Eventually he gave up on trying to follow Kayla\u2019s confusing baby talk and focused entirely on Bronwyn, nodding now and then to keep Kayla happy.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked her quietly, noting the stubborn tilt of her jaw and the unshed tears in her luminous eyes. He felt like an absolute bastard driving her to the brink of tears . . . again!</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d She nodded, folding her arms defensively over her chest.</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d he began, but Kayla was bouncing up and down, demanding that he play horsey with her. He kissed the little girl, before going to the door and hollering for Rick, immediately quieting Kayla, who looked up at him uncertainly, wondering if her daddy was mad at her. Bryce grinned down at her reassuringly, making airplane noises and flying her around the room for a few moments, before Rick came panting up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked urgently.</p><p>\u201cKayla . . .\u201d Bryce planted an affectionate kiss on his daughter\u2019s silky cheek. \u201cThis is your Uncle Rick!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnca?\u201d The girl wondered doubtfully.</p><p>\u201cYes and he likes to play horsey!\u201d Rick, who had been grinning foolishly down at the little girl, abruptly stopped smiling and met his brother\u2019s eyes in horror.</p> <p>\u201cUnca, horsey?\u201d the little girl asked excitedly.</p><p>\u201cYou want to play horsey with Uncle Rick while Mummy and Daddy talk?\u201d Bryce asked gently, knowing that she wouldn\u2019t understand anything but \u201cplay horsey\u201d and \u201cUncle Rick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, Bryce . . .\u201d Rick began while back-pedaling frantically; he stopped abruptly when Kayla bestowed her most radiantly trusting smile on him and held out her arms.</p><p>\u201cHorsey, Unca Wick?\u201d she asked coyly, and Rick swallowed visibly before stepping forward and lifting the little girl from her father\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cWhat an accomplished little flirt you already are.\u201d He chuckled before meeting Bryce\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have your hands full with this one, in twelve or so years\u2019 time, big brother.\u201d Bryce grinned halfheartedly and shrugged.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll cross that bridge when I come to it. Please keep her busy, Rick. Bron and I need to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay no more,\u201d Rick interrupted cheerfully while Kayla tugged at his hair and shirt, impatient to be off. \u201cCome along, Kayla, let\u2019s go and meet your cousin and your auntie Lisa. She loves to play horsey too!\u201d He carried the friendly little girl, who seemed to have forgotten all about her parents at the prospect of playing with exciting new people, out of the room and left Bronwyn and Bryce to contemplate each other quietly for a few moments.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem this time, Bryce?\u201d Bronwyn asked with what appeared to be sarcasm, if her face was any indication. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I stormed out and ruined your perfect little party.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe night you left,\u201d he began quietly, trying to keep his voice level and calm, not wanting to come across as accusatory or angry. \u201cAfter my accident, Bron, I swear I saw you in the crowd and, even though I knew that I was the one who had driven you out of the house in the first place, in my mind, abandoning me there was completely unforgivable. I know that my reaction to your pregnancy was cruel and unwarranted, but despite that, you were my wife, the person I depended on the most, the woman who claimed to love me, and you left me there! It made no sense to me and it hurt so damned much. It also gave me an excuse to hate you because feeling anything other than that was just too . . .\u201d He broke off awkwardly, aware of her frown and her confusion.</p><p>\u201cBryce, I wasn\u2019t . . .\u201d she began but he held up a hand.</p><p>\u201cPlease . . . I . . . let me speak.\u201d He shut his eyes painfully. \u201cI remember it so vividly; I looked up and saw you standing there on the fringe of the gathering crowd. You looked cold, remote, and so beautiful. You were wearing the dress that I loved. Remember? The little black one with the floaty skirt. I tried to call you, but my voice wouldn\u2019t work. I now know that I was shouting at the top of my lungs.\u201d He grinned feebly. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t hear myself. Do you understand why it\u2019s been so difficult to let go of that image? How I can\u2019t ever get the memory of you turning your back and walking away from me out of my mind?\u201d</p><p>Bronwyn stared up into his dark and tormented face. She knew how much it must have cost him to come up here and reveal how much he been hurt by her perceived actions that night. She sighed; so much for letting him muddle through it on his own. She couldn\u2019t, not when he had just presented her with the means to refute his repulsive accusation.</p> <p>\u201cBryce.\u201d Her throat caught, and she inhaled deeply as she fought back the ever-present urge to cry. \u201cI have something to show you.\u201d She led him into the master bedroom and toward the huge walk-in closet that housed her old wardrobe. She opened the door and rifled through the contents briefly before lifting a padded hanger with a flimsy scrap of black chiffon hanging from it.</p><p>\u201cThis dress?\u201d she asked gently, and he winced as if the dress brought back cripplingly painful memories. He nodded. She shut her eyes tightly as she fought for composure, so did not see the slight movement he made toward her before stopping himself.</p><p>\u201cBryce,\u201d she murmured unsteadily, opening her eyes again. \u201cI was wearing a pair of jeans and a T-shirt when I left that night. I left with nothing but the clothes on my back. This dress . . . it\u2019s been hanging here for the last two years.\u201d Bryce shifted his gaze to the dress and shook his head, unable to believe that he had gotten something so very crucial to the well-being of their relationship so totally wrong. He took the dress from her and ran the flimsy material gently through his large hands.</p><p>\u201cRick could have packed . . .\u201d he began, but she touched his hand to get his attention and shook her head slowly, keeping her eyes level.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask Rick? I\u2019m sure he\u2019d remember a dress like this among the endless amounts of toddler-proof wear he packed for me.\u201d She nibbled at her lower lip. \u201cI left on a Tuesday night, remember?\u201d</p> <p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cThis is a cocktail dress, Bryce,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cWere we at a party that night?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated before responding.</p><p>\u201cNo. You called me at the office and told me you were cooking a special meal because you had something exciting to tell me . . .\u201d His voice broke and he was trembling from head to foot. Bronwyn was the one who remained rock-steady for a change, while Bryce looked like he was on the verge of tears. \u201cI came home and found you wearing your tattered blue jeans and one of those T-shirts you\u2019d bought in the Seychelles. You said that you didn\u2019t feel like dressing up for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you changed your clothes and we had a picnic in the conservatory. After dinner I told you I was pregnant and you . . .\u201d</p><p>He swallowed painfully.</p> <p>\u201cI reacted in the worst possible way,\u201d he grated. \u201cI told you to leave and you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWearing the same jeans and T-shirt that I\u2019d been wearing all evening,\u201d she finished. His face contorted savagely, and he flung the dress aside with a vicious curse. Bronwyn flinched at the sudden movement, unable to gauge his mood, not sure if he believed her or not. He brushed past her abruptly to slam his way into the en suite, and she was shocked to hear the sound of violent retching coming from behind the closed door. She hovered outside, unsure if she should venture in or wait for him to come back out. She had just made up her mind to go in, when the ghastly sounds stopped and she heard the toilet flush, followed by the sounds of water running and gargling.</p><p>He opened the door slowly, and she found herself staring up at him warily. He looked awful, hollow-eyed, hunted, and like he had aged ten years in the last ten minutes. He couldn\u2019t quite bring himself to meet her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d he began. \u201cI don\u2019t know . . .\u201d He raised a violently trembling hand toward her but checked the movement abruptly, his hand falling limply back to his side.</p><p>\u201cBryce . . .\u201d she murmured uncertainly, but he shook his head abruptly, lifting his eyes to her face, and Bronwyn was horrified by the depth of self-loathing she saw in his tortured gaze. It was mingled with overwhelming regret and something akin to fear and desperation.</p><p>\u201cGod, how you must hate me,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think . . .\u201d But it was too late, he turned away before she could say anything more and exited the room abruptly. Bronwyn felt ridiculously deflated by the anticlimactic end to such an intense conversation. That Bryce believed her was no longer in doubt, but he now seemed wholly unable to deal with his own culpability in the failure of their relationship. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother finding Cooper,\u201d Bryce growled upon stepping out onto the sunny patio where his brother, sister-in-law, and the two toddlers were happily playing. They, all four, came to an abrupt halt at the sound of his gruff voice. Lisa and Rick looked concerned, Rhys started crying, and Kayla merely looked happy to see him, as always. While Lisa picked Rhys up for a cuddle, Kayla babbled on incoherently but Bryce couldn\u2019t focus and was unable to tell what the child was trying to communicate. It was difficult enough to understand her under normal circumstances, but the emotional turmoil he was in right now made it damned near impossible to make out what she was trying to say to him. He nodded and smiled blindly down at her, before switching his gaze to Rick.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d his brother asked when their gazes met.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s telling the truth,\u201d Bryce bit off tautly, the knowledge still tearing him apart.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA dress.\u201d Bryce shook his head in shattered disbelief. \u201cI was so sure of what I\u2019d seen that night, I could remember every single detail of the accident scene down to the dress she was wearing as she stood there watching me scream her name.\u201d He fought back the urge to laugh like a maniac, knowing that it would send him careening off the edge of reason. \u201cOnly she wasn\u2019t wearing a dress the night she left me, Rick. I should have known that because I now remember thinking how damned sexy she looked in those jeans, just moments before everything went to hell. Not the cocktail dress I\u2019d been remembering her in for the last two years but a pair of jeans and a T-shirt. Oh God . . . oh my God!\u201d He saw Rick go pale and knew that he had to look equally pasty-faced. The younger man blasphemed shakily.</p><p>\u201cSo now what, Bryce?\u201d</p><p>Bryce shook his head helplessly at his brother\u2019s question.</p><p>\u201cNow I give her everything she wants because that\u2019s the least of what she deserves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if she wants a divorce?\u201d</p> <p>It was the one thing Bryce had been trying not to think about, and he flinched from the question.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t blame her.\u201d Bryce\u2019s eyes fell to his happily bubbling daughter, who was trying to share her stuffed toys with a still-crying Rhys. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019ll do if she asks for one.\u201d</p><p>Bronwyn came down about an hour later to find Rick and Lisa in the conservatory with Kayla and Rhys. The children were playing together contentedly. There was no sign of Bryce. Rick hopped to his feet agitatedly when he saw her enter the room and immediately apologized.</p><p>\u201cI was unforgivably rude and needlessly cruel, Bron,\u201d he muttered, shoving his hands into the back pockets of his jeans. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I know I hurt you, but . . . damn it, Bron, he\u2019s my brother and he was so damaged and so completely changed by something we all thought was your fault. It just felt like too large an obstacle to overcome!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically it was my fault,\u201d she pointed out grimly. \u201cHe came after me that night, and if not for that he would not have had his accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it was his fault and he admits as much. If he hadn\u2019t been such an absolute bastard about your pregnancy, none of it would have happened. I\u2019m so sorry, Bronwyn.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRicky.\u201d She sighed wearily, not sure why she felt the need to comfort him but wanting to set his mind at ease nonetheless. \u201cYou were being loyal to your brother. It was his word against mine. You did what you thought was right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you plan to do now?\u201d Rick asked after an awkward pause. He was unable to look her in the eye, and she knew how hard the truth must have hit him. Knowing how unjustly he and Bryce had treated her would not sit comfortably with someone who had such an innate sense of fairness. She knew that it would eat at him for a while and that their relationship might never go back to the way it was before.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she asked tiredly.</p><p>\u201cWell, my brother is pretty torn up about this, Bron.\u201d</p><p>She laughed grimly at his words, cutting him off.</p><p>\u201cYes, and it\u2019s always about him isn\u2019t it?\u201d she asked bitterly.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s just . . .\u201d Rick trailed off awkwardly, not sure what to say. \u201cWill you leave him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t really want me, you know? He wants Kayla. I\u2019m just excess baggage.\u201d She shrugged.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019ll give you just about anything you ask for right now,\u201d Rick pointed out.</p><p>\u201cIs that so? Well then, where is he? Maybe it\u2019s time I start making my demands. While his guilt lasts . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBronwyn, you\u2019re being\u2014\u201d he began, but Lisa, who had been keeping the children occupied, interrupted whatever he\u2019d been about to say.</p><p>\u201cBryce is in his study,\u201d she informed quietly, absently picking Kayla up and handing her over to Rick while she lifted Rhys into her arms. Bronwyn nodded her thanks and dropped a loving kiss on her daughter\u2019s head before turning on her heel and heading out of the room.</p><p>She didn\u2019t ring the doorbell; she wanted an honest reaction from him and did not want to give him time to mask whatever he was feeling. So she strode in confidently and then halted before she\u2019d gotten more than two steps into the room, suddenly unsure of her decision.</p><p>He sat behind his huge desk, with his head in his hands in almost exactly the same pose as the day before but he looked so incredibly lost and alone that, for a moment, she was unsure of what her next move should be. He must have sensed her presence because he looked up unexpectedly, pinning her to the spot with his tormented gaze. It said a lot for the changed status of their relationship that he did not immediately fly off the handle because of her supposed \u201cintrusion\u201d into his lair. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t fix this,\u201d he admitted bleakly. His voice was quivering in a way that would have killed his pride if he had been able to hear it. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to.\u201d He looked strangely defenseless with his messy hair and his disheveled clothing, but she steeled herself against his vulnerability. While she was happy that he now knew the truth, the simple fact of the matter was that she couldn\u2019t trust him with her heart. It had never been safe with him, but she hadn\u2019t known it until he had so ruthlessly rejected her two years ago. Yes, he was now filled with regret about the mistake he had made immediately following his accident, but he still had no explanations or apologies for the behavior that had driven her out in the first place.</p><p>She did not know what to say to him, did not know what she wanted from him anymore. Just the day before she had idealistically and unrealistically imagined that if they tried to get along, their relationship would improve and they could build on that. Of course, they both had Kayla\u2019s best interests at heart and wanted to provide stability for her, but Bronwyn deserved better than a second-rate marriage, with them staying together only for the sake of their daughter. Right now Bronwyn also honestly believed that Kayla would be better off if their marriage was severed sooner rather than later. It was better than raising their baby in an atmosphere of mistrust.</p><p>After all, this was the man who had thought nothing of kicking her out of their home after discovering that she was pregnant with his baby. The same man who had left her to fend for herself when she was at her weakest. He had also accused her of the most heinous of acts and no amount of guilt now could make up for his many sins. Any relationship that they tried to salvage from this wreckage of a marriage would be based on a foundation of guilt and misguided obligation.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it can be fixed anymore, Bryce,\u201d she said reluctantly, moving toward his desk and sitting down in the huge leather chair across from him. He flinched and averted his face briefly before turning his head to look at her once more.</p> <p>\u201cSo what do you want to do?\u201d he asked tonelessly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she admitted helplessly. \u201cI think we would all be better off if we, you and I, were no longer together. Let\u2019s face it, after two years of separation, the next logical step is a mere formality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to leave,\u201d he said matter-of-factly. \u201cAgain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t exactly want to leave the last time, Bryce,\u201d she reminded him pointedly. She was small-minded enough to enjoy seeing the barb hit home. \u201cI just don\u2019t think this situation can be redeemed. Too much has been said and done to go back.\u201d He scrubbed a tired hand over his face before tilting his head back and shutting his eyes. After a few moments of silence, he opened his eyes and looked back at her with his piercing eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you plan to do after you leave?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going back to university to finish my studies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t it be difficult to be a full-time student when you\u2019re a single parent again?\u201d Her mouth gaped in surprise at the wholly unexpected question.</p><p>\u201cCorrect me if I\u2019m wrong, but I assumed that I was no longer a single parent.\u201d His eyes flickered with something akin to relief, and Bronwyn\u2019s surprise very quickly turned to horrified comprehension. \u201cYou thought I was taking her away from you?\u201d He nodded in response to her shocked question.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you may have done to deserve it, Bryce, I won\u2019t deny you your right to be a father to Kayla. Even though you once tossed away that privilege as cavalierly as you would a pair of old socks.\u201d Another direct hit. \u201cAnd don\u2019t get me wrong here; I am not doing it for you! Kayla needs you in her life.\u201d He nodded again, this time more confidently.</p><p>\u201cSo you want to finish your studies?\u201d he prompted after clearing his throat awkwardly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to find a decent place to live and a job to pay for\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary,\u201d he inserted hurriedly. \u201cThe job, I mean. I\u2019ll pay for your studies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only money I\u2019ll ever want from you will go toward the upbringing of your daughter, Bryce. I can take care of myself!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis from the woman who was practically on her last legs when we found her? You will not run yourself into the ground again. I can, and will, take care of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not your property; you have no right to speak to me as if I were,\u201d she said, seething, and he swore in frustration.</p><p>\u201cOkay, can we compromise on this?\u201d he asked meekly after what looked like a colossal effort to rein in his temper. \u201cI have a suggestion.\u201d She waited silently for him to continue, her arms folded defiantly over her chest as she prepared for battle.</p><p>\u201cYou and Kayla stay here.\u201d He lifted a silencing hand as she started to protest. \u201cNo, wait, just listen. You and Kayla stay here, and that way, she and I would be able to see each other all the time. You find that job to pay for your studies, and you\u2019ll have built-in babysitters for Kayla in both Celeste and me. You won\u2019t be run off your feet, studying, working a part-time job, and caring for a demanding toddler. You also won\u2019t have to worry about rent and food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in this for you?\u201d she asked suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cLike I said, unrestricted access to my daughter,\u201d was his simple response. \u201cAnd enough time to get to know her better.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about us? Our marriage?\u201d She broached the subject warily, and he averted his eyes down to his clenched hands again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell there is no more marriage, is there?\u201d he droned tonelessly. \u201cThis house is big enough for us to live completely separate lives. We could work out some kind of schedule, times you may need certain areas of the house to yourself. Please don\u2019t reject the idea out of hand just because it came from me. It makes sense and you won\u2019t be killing yourself trying to make ends meet. I won\u2019t interfere with your life at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your work?\u201d she asked when his eyes were on her again.</p><p>\u201cI work mostly from home these days.\u201d He shrugged and she hesitated, her mind busily going over every angle of his plan. \u201cI do plan to spend some more time in the office in the future, but we have an excellent in-house day-care facility, so she\u2019ll never be too far from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis can\u2019t be a permanent arrangement,\u201d she said after a long pause, knowing that she was compromising way too much. Her instincts were screaming at her to move out, but she kept thinking of Kayla and how much she adored her father. \u201cAnd if I\u2019m staying here, I\u2019ll want to pay rent,\u201d she cautioned, and he dipped his head in acquiescence.</p> <p>\u201cI know it can\u2019t be permanent, but it\u2019ll give you time to arrange your future; it will give me time to get to know Kayla and vice versa. You can pay a reasonable amount for rent, and the amount will include food and utilities. But if you\u2019re paying rent, you won\u2019t be able to pay for your tuition and books, so I\u2019d like to give you a student loan, low interest, which you can pay off in your own time,\u201d he hurried on when it looked like she was about to protest. \u201cIt\u2019s a better deal than you\u2019d get from any bank, Bronwyn. No strings attached. Once you\u2019ve finished your studies and are settled into your new career, you\u2019ll be better equipped to move out, and Kayla will be old enough to understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBryce, that will take years.\u201d She was aghast at the thought of living in limbo for so long. But still, it was an awfully tempting suggestion, and Bronwyn knew she\u2019d be a fool to turn it down when she had so few other options. But things were starting to get sticky again, too many ties and way too many complications. \u201cWe have to move on with our lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so we shall. We\u2019ll just be sharing a house, Bron . . . nothing else. This works out to everyone\u2019s advantage, and it\u2019s best for Kayla.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to . . .\u201d She cleared her throat, not really wanting to be the one to mention the inevitable. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to start proceedings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProceedings?\u201d He looked confused.</p> <p>\u201cDivorce proceedings,\u201d she clarified, and he very quickly averted his face, shielding his eyes from her.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d He nodded before lifting his eyes to her face again.</p><p>\u201cIt will be awkward once we start seeing other people, Bryce.\u201d She decided to be the one to bite the bullet and speak the inescapable words. He cleared his throat uncomfortably before nodding again.</p><p>\u201cI just ask that we both practice some discretion when it comes to that. Any . . . uh . . . any liaisons you . . . we see fit to start will have to be conducted outside of the home. For Kayla\u2019s sake, of course. Anything else would confuse her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds reasonable,\u201d she agreed, even while nervousness ate away at her stomach. She wasn\u2019t sure that she was doing the right thing. Sure, she was taking the easy way out, but apprehension kept niggling away at the back of her mind. She got up gracefully and looked down at him for a long moment. \u201cThis marriage was probably never meant to be, Bryce. We were always too different.\u201d He averted his gaze, saying nothing in response, and Bronwyn sighed before turning away and heading toward the door.</p><p>\u201cWe were good together once.\u201d The words sounded torn from him, and she turned around to face him again.</p> <p>\u201cFor a very brief time, so long ago that it seems like a dream now,\u201d she reflected, her eyes misty. She dipped her chin at him before leaving.</p><p>Bryce watched her go before slumping back into his chair and kneading his temples with his fists. God, how the hell had this happened? How could he have gotten everything so wrong? He thought back to that terrible night and fought the painful memories, but they were relentlessly flooding back.</p><p>CHAPTER NINE</p><p>That night, two years ago, Bryce had leaned against the doorframe and watched as Bronwyn, unaware of his presence, flitted happily around the kitchen. She had her back to the door and her sweet little behind, deliciously molded by the faded fabric of her jeans, had wriggled energetically to the beat of the lively salsa tune coming from the iPod speakers on the kitchen counter. She clearly thought she was alone in the house. It was something she did quite often: dismissed the servants to surprise him with a meal that she had lovingly prepared. He would be lying if he didn\u2019t admit to loving these moments of intimate domesticity. Eventually, he found the temptation of that cute little butt too much to resist. He crept up behind her to grab her hips and draw her back against him. She squealed in delight before turning in his grasp and throwing her arms around his neck. His own arms crept around her slender waist and they danced together sexily for a while. He started nuzzling her neck before she laughed and pulled herself out of his embrace.</p><p>\u201cSilly man, stop distracting me,\u201d she chided, bracing her hands on his chest. \u201cDinner will be spoiled if I allow you to lead me into temptation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can give dinner a miss,\u201d he growled as he reached for her again, but she giggled happily and danced out of his reach.</p><p>\u201cBut I can\u2019t,\u201d she laughed. \u201cI\u2019m starving. Why don\u2019t you go and shower off the day\u2019s grit and grime while I finish up in here?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGod, you make it sound like I work on a construction site.\u201d He smiled down at her, indicating his disheveled gray suit.</p><p>\u201cHmm, I\u2019d like that,\u201d she murmured as she eyed his tall, broad form critically. \u201cIt\u2019d certainly help with all the flab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlab?\u201d He pretended to be outraged but was completely confident that he sported no flab or excess weight of any kind. She laughed again and wrapped her arms around his waist before stretching up to drop a sweet kiss on his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she told him, and he smiled back. He loved it when she said those words to him, and he felt such overwhelming tenderness in return that it nearly brought him to his knees. He brushed her silky brown hair from her forehead and planted a kiss on her soft skin.</p> <p>\u201cMy Bronwyn,\u201d he whispered against her forehead, tugging at the ponytail she had secured in the nape of her neck and dragging her head back for a proper kiss. When it ended he was aching with desire, and she looked a little dazed.</p><p>\u201cGet dinner done, woman, before I head straight for dessert,\u201d he growled as his eyes dipped to the small breasts straining at her light-blue T-shirt so that she could not mistake his meaning. She wasn\u2019t wearing a bra\u2014she hardly ever did when she was at home\u2014her breasts didn\u2019t need the support, and he could see her nipples tenting the soft fabric. The sight made him hotter than hell, and he had to force himself to move away from her. After two years of marriage, he was constantly surprised by how much he still wanted her.</p><p>He eagerly rushed through his shower, and by the time he entered the conservatory, she had laid out a picnic beside one of the floor-to-ceiling plate-glass windows, the one with the ocean view. He\u2019d never seen her look more beautiful, and again his stomach tightened with that feeling of tenderness. She was sitting on a blanket that she had spread out on the floor, and he dropped down next to her. He reached for the bottle of red wine that she\u2019d placed within easy reach and frowned when he noticed that there was only one glass.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not having any wine?\u201d he asked, and she shook her head. Her beautiful eyes tangled with his, and he frowned as he tried to read the emotion in them. He could usually read her pretty easily, but her eyes were a mystery tonight and it unsettled him a bit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m having water tonight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you still worried about your reaction to that glass of wine at Pierre\u2019s party last week?\u201d he asked in concern, referring to her dizzy spell. He\u2019d attributed it to overwork and a bad vintage.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it.\u201d She smiled cryptically while her small fingers worried the edge of the blanket. Bryce tried to puzzle through her odd behavior as he poured his own drink.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me this news that you\u2019re so excited about,\u201d he prompted, referring to her giddy phone call to his office that afternoon.</p><p>\u201cAfter we\u2019ve eaten,\u201d she said quietly, and his eyes dipped to the Mediterranean feast that she had laid out before them. She had prepared seed loaf, feta cheese, and black olives as appetizers, along with fresh vegetables and dolmades with hummus, complemented by aubergine and tzatziki dips and falafels in pita. She lifted an olive to his lips, and he opened up, sucking at the tips of her fingers as he accepted the tangy fruit into his mouth. He returned the favor, and they had the rest of their meal in a similar fashion, laughing and murmuring intimacies as they fed each other. By the end of the meal, she was leaning back against his chest, with her head nestled in the nook between his jaw and collarbone. They quietly watched the sun drop into the ocean and turn the horizon into a painter\u2019s palette of red, orange, crimson, and scarlet.</p><p>He had his arm draped over her shoulder and across her breasts, and she was toying with his long and capable fingers. Bryce reveled in the closeness, wondering, not for the first time, how the hell he had gotten so lucky. He felt utterly at peace; they belonged together. They were like two halves of a whole. God knows he had never believed that such an utterly clich\u00e9d thought would ever cross his mind, but there it was; she was his other half and he could spend the rest of his life with just her by his side. They were a perfect unit. He shut his eyes to the sunset and tightened his arm around her slender frame. She lifted his hand to her lips and pressed a kiss into his broad palm.</p><p>\u201cBryce,\u201d she murmured quietly, and he made a slight sound to let her know that she had his attention. \u201cI\u2019m pregnant.\u201d</p> <p>Their new living arrangements were not as bad as Bronwyn had feared they would be. Bryce pretty much kept his word, and she hardly ever saw him around the house and would have sworn that she and Kayla were alone in the house if not for the little girl\u2019s constant references to her daddy and what fun they had while Mummy was at work or at school. She had been back at university for nearly a month; luckily her late enrollment for the first semester in March had been easily accepted, and she had been allowed to resume her studies with very little fuss. It was about six weeks since she and Bryce had made their deal, and Bronwyn was starting to relax and enjoy the freedom of movement that she now had. She worked part-time in a bookshop. It was a job that Lisa, a bookshop proprietor herself, had told her about. Most of Bronwyn\u2019s lectures were over by one in the afternoon, so she worked from about two to six every day, leaving her with enough time to enjoy her evenings with Kayla. It was so quiet in the esoteric bookshop that she often had time to study. She also had weekends off because the shop\u2019s owner was older and didn\u2019t like having the business open on weekends. The pay was good, the work was easy, and the hours were ideal; she could have kissed Lisa when the other woman told her about it. Bronwyn also loved the challenge of studying again; she hadn\u2019t even known how much she missed it until she had gone back. Exercising and expanding her brain after such an extended period of nothing but \u201cmummy duty\u201d felt wonderful! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was making new friends at school, and she spent a lot of time with Lisa and Alice as well as with Lisa\u2019s cousin, Theresa. The latter was a year older than Bronwyn\u2019s twenty-eight and had a six-month-old baby girl. They (unimaginatively) called themselves the \u201cMummy Club\u201d and spent most Saturdays actively avoiding mummy duty by leaving the babies with their husbands and escaping for a well-deserved girls\u2019 day out. They were all busy women: Lisa had her shop, Alice was a chef, and both Theresa and Bronwyn had just started studying again, Theresa only part-time because of the new baby.</p><p>Bronwyn was actually starting to enjoy her life again, despite the unusual situation at home. Soon she started noticing that one of her professors, a man in his mid-thirties, appeared to be taking more than the usual interest in her. She didn\u2019t quite know how to react to that fact. It had been so long since she\u2019d felt even remotely attractive that the male interest, while flattering, was a little unnerving. It also felt so wrong to even be talking to a man who was so obviously attracted to her while she was still married to Bryce. It made her wonder about the divorce. She had assumed that Bryce would start proceedings, but she hadn\u2019t heard a peep about it from him. She wasn\u2019t sure if he was expecting her to do it or if he was content to let things stay as they were for the moment. The uncertainty was driving her mad, so she took it upon herself to speak to some of the law students about her options. Being young and overly ambitious, most of them advised her to \u201ctake him for everything she could get,\u201d but one young man had thoughtfully given her his father\u2019s number after informing her that his parent was a divorce lawyer. He also cautioned her to tread carefully when there were custody matters to consider.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t used the number yet and wasn\u2019t sure if she should or even if she could. The thought of finally ending her marriage, even if it could only be described as such in the loosest possible terms, was not a pleasant one. Not when she still cared for her husband, more than he probably deserved.</p><p>The ambiguity of her feelings reached even greater heights when her professor, Raymond Mayfair, acted on his interest in her and asked her out. Bronwyn battled with the decision for a while before accepting his invitation. She made sure to warn him that nothing would ever happen between them while she was married. He graciously accepted her terms and told her that he just wanted to spend time with her.</p> <p>That night she deliberately sought Bryce out for the first time in more than two months and found him hiding out in the den and watching television with the sound turned down. For some reason, the den, with all its audio visual equipment, was the last place she\u2019d expected to find him. An ignorant assumption, she acknowledged, since his deafness didn\u2019t prevent him from watching television or enjoying music with heavier beats. He sat in an easy chair and the only parts of him that were visible to her were the back of his head and his right hand, which was hanging over the arm of the chair with a glass of amber-colored liquid dangling from his fingers.</p><p>At first, she was so preoccupied by the fact that she had found him after half an hour of searching that what he was watching did not register with her. Then she glanced up and found herself riveted by her own smiling face on the huge flat-screen television. The camera angle changed to include Bryce in the shot; he was leaning toward her, his mouth to her ear as he whispered something intimate enough to make her blush. It was their wedding DVD with the sound turned down. She was dressed in a beautiful white concoction that had cost the earth but that Bryce had paid for, and he looked gorgeous in a stylish black tuxedo. They both looked so young and happy and were wrapped up in each other to the exclusion of everyone else. She watched as he fast-forwarded through Rick\u2019s best man speech and resumed playing when the focus was back on them.</p><p>She took a step backward, feeling like she was intruding on yet another moment that she knew he would not want her to witness. Her back hit the door and her fingers fumbled with the handle but her eyes remained glued to the screen. He hit the pause button, and she panicked, thinking that he was about to get up, but he merely leaned forward, his attention still focused on the screen. She shifted her stricken gaze to the larger-than-life frozen image of her beaming face. She looked radiant and so hopelessly in love. The room was absolutely silent, and she was achingly aware of how loud the pounding of her heart sounded to her own ears and of how ragged her breathing had become.</p><p>After a seemingly interminable amount of time had passed, she succeeded in getting a decent grip on the door handle and managed to slip out without him ever knowing that she had been there. But the haunting image of Bryce in that silent room watching that video stayed with her all evening. She didn\u2019t understand why he had dug up that old thing. It served only to emphasize how catastrophically they had failed as a couple.</p><p>She still needed to talk with him; she couldn\u2019t go out with Raymond without telling Bryce about it first. It was the decent thing to do. So she waited another couple of hours until she heard him prowling around in the kitchen. She ventured boldly into the spacious room and stepped immediately into his line of vision, not wanting to startle him. He was just turning away from the huge double-door refrigerator with some sandwich ingredients stacked precariously in his arms and stilled abruptly at the sight of her. The abrupt cessation of movement unsettled the food and dislodged a tomato, which rolled from the top of the armload and landed on the floor between them with a soft plop. Bronwyn winced and they both stared down at the mess the unfortunate tomato had made on the tiled floor. They looked up at the same time and their gazes met uncertainly.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to startle you,\u201d she apologized, both verbally and in the sign language that she was still trying to learn in her free time. Because of school, her lessons had had to be moved to Saturdays before her usual get-together with the other ladies. His eyes dropped to her busy hands and narrowed sharply as they took in the graceful movements of her fingers.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he said out loud, shrugging slightly. He didn\u2019t mention the sign language she had used, and she was both relieved and somewhat disappointed by that. He brushed by her and headed toward the large wooden island in the middle of the kitchen to drop the ingredients on the black marble\u2013topped surface, while Bronwyn used a damp paper towel to wipe up the mess on the floor. When she was done, she rounded the island to face him again while he busily went about constructing an imaginative sandwich. He kept his eyes on his task and Bronwyn sighed in frustration before waving her hand beneath his eyes to get his attention. Finally, reluctantly, he looked up to face her.</p><p>\u201cI have to talk to you about something,\u201d she half signed, half spoke, and he nodded warily. \u201cI need you to watch Kayla tomorrow night.\u201d Something akin to relief flickered in his eyes, and he smiled slowly, nodding again.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d His eyes dropped back to his sandwich. \u201cI know that you have to start studying, mid-terms can\u2019t be that far off.\u201d Bronwyn groaned, this was going to be more difficult than she had originally anticipated. She waved her hand beneath his eyes again.</p> <p>\u201cBryce,\u201d she began when she had his attention again. \u201cI have a date.\u201d She said the words aloud, choosing not to sign them, and his eyes remained fixed on her lips for such a long time that she began to wonder if he might have misunderstood her. His large hands were resting on the wooden surface of the island, his sloppy sandwich teetering unsteadily between them, and as she dropped her eyes, wondering if she should repeat the statement, she noticed them curling into huge fists and knew that he had not misunderstood or misread her lips. He was trying to figure out how to deal with her words.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re married,\u201d he reminded, almost absently, his voice sounding strangely hoarse. She raised her eyes to his face again and was startled to see how strained and pale he looked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not married, Bryce,\u201d she whispered. \u201cNot really. Not for a long time now. You know that. You said it yourself; there is no marriage. We\u2019re separated and merely sharing a house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho . . .\u201d He began to frame a question but then simply turned the one word into a question. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of my professors. He\u2019s a nice man, decent.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow decent can he be if he dates his students?\u201d Bryce hissed furiously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a child, Bryce, and Raymond is only two years older than you are. It\u2019s hardly unethical for us to go out on a perfectly harmless date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you should do this,\u201d he began, but she held up a silencing hand.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t come to you for your blessing, Bryce,\u201d she told him firmly. \u201cI felt that telling you would be the right thing to do, because we are still legally bound. Yes, we have a child together and we\u2019re sharing a house, but our marriage, if we can call it that anymore, is over. I want to move on with my life, and the only way either of us can do that is if we get a divorce. So if you won\u2019t start the proceedings, then I will. I\u2019ll be seeing an attorney as soon as possible.\u201d He lowered his gaze back to his sandwich.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably better that way,\u201d he agreed quietly. \u201cIf you need me to watch Kayla tomorrow night, I will.\u201d He raised his enigmatic eyes back to hers and she smiled gently.</p><p>\u201cOne more thing, Bryce,\u201d she said tentatively. \u201cI don\u2019t want a security guy hovering in the background while I\u2019m out tomorrow night. So I\u2019m dismissing Paul early. Please clear it with Cal.\u201d Poor Paul would probably be relieved to have the time off. Her life was pretty mundane, and while he was too professional to ever show it, she suspected that he was bored out of his mind for the most part.</p> <p>\u201cFine,\u201d he gritted after a long pause, clearly not happy with that idea but acquiescing when he realized that she wasn\u2019t going to budge on the matter.</p><p>\u201cIn fact, I would prefer it if Paul didn\u2019t come to campus or work with me. It\u2019s a waste of your resources. I\u2019m perfectly safe, and I would just feel more comfortable without him constantly hovering in the background.\u201d She knew that she was pushing it and that Bryce wasn\u2019t likely to budge on this, but she really felt like a pretentious freak with a bodyguard constantly dogging her steps. It made her feel completely conspicuous.</p><p>\u201cBronwyn, I take your and Kayla\u2019s safety very seriously,\u201d he said darkly.</p><p>\u201cLook, of course I want Kayla to be safe, and I absolutely agree on the issue of security for her, but I\u2019m not quite in the same boat. I\u2019m your all-but-estranged wife. Not quite the prime target for kidnappers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProspective kidnappers don\u2019t know the intimate details of our marriage, Bron,\u201d he pointed out reasonably. \u201cYou\u2019re living with me, you\u2019re the mother of my child, and you\u2019re a target. End of story. Paul stays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, can you at least give me some time to myself on Monday then? I have something to take care of.\u201d While she had just informed him she would be seeing an attorney, she didn\u2019t want Bryce hearing about it from the hired help before she had a chance to tell him about it in person. That wasn\u2019t the way she wanted him to learn the news. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cBryce, I don\u2019t ask you for much, just grant me this one request and allow me to cling to the illusion that I still have some semblance of privacy in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly on Monday?\u201d he clarified reluctantly, and she nodded. \u201cVery well, I\u2019ll inform Cal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, and he inclined his head curtly before turning away from her and heading to the refrigerator, his rigid back telling her that he wanted her gone by the time he turned back. Bronwyn wasted no time in beating a hasty retreat. She headed to the nursery to watch Kayla sleep and silently mourned the loss of the life she could never have with the man she so desperately loved.</p> <p>Bryce wanted to break something, wanted to hurt someone, preferably the smarmy bastard who had ingratiated himself to Bryce\u2019s wife! God, this was so much worse than he\u2019d imagined. Bronwyn was moving on with her life and seeing other people. What if she let this guy, this Raymond, touch her or, worse, make love to her? His stomach rebelled at the thought, and he picked up his half-made sandwich and tossed it into the trashcan.</p><p>He pressed the heels of his hands to his eyes and frantically tried to figure out what to do, how to make this right, but he didn\u2019t know how. He no longer had any control over his own life. Everything was sliding so swiftly downhill that he knew it was only a matter of time before it all ended. Bronwyn didn\u2019t see herself as his wife anymore. She wanted nothing to do with him, and who could blame her? After the way he had behaved, it was nothing less than he deserved. He could threaten her with a custody battle, but he didn\u2019t have it in him to do that to her or Kayla.</p><p>After all those months of self-righteous anger and believing he was the wronged one, while his Bronwyn suffered unimaginable horrors on her own, he now had to face up to the fact that he had brought all of this upon himself. Blackmailing Bronwyn to stay with him, after everything else that he had done wrong, would in no way, shape, or form restore his self-respect. He had to let her go; she deserved to be happy and it was obvious that he couldn\u2019t make her happy, that he had very rarely made her happy. That was his failure, his shame, and his cross to bear, and he would no longer have her share that burden.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you mean, you\u2019re pregnant? What about your studies and the mutual decision we made when we first got married? We were going to wait, Bronwyn, remember? Just tell me you\u2019re joking.\u201d The fury he had felt that night scorched its way through his body and obliterated his ability to think rationally. He moved away from her and jumped to his feet to glower down at her. She had looked so confused and hurt that for a moment he nearly softened, nearly took her into his arms to comfort her. But then those two words echoed their way through his brain again and his white-hot, bitter anger reasserted itself. The sense of betrayal left an acrid taste in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI know that it\u2019s sooner than we\u2019d planned,\u201d she said softly, trying to maintain an even tone of voice. \u201cBut this is the reality of our situation now and it can\u2019t be changed. We\u2019re having a baby . . . a baby, Bryce. Don\u2019t you understand how wonderful that is?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you did this. I can\u2019t believe you would stoop to this,\u201d he gritted out bitterly. \u201cThis was supposed to be a joint decision. I\u2019m not ready for this, Bronwyn. I don\u2019t want a kid, damn it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s our baby . . . we made it together,\u201d she protested, and he could hear the pain and confusion in her voice but just couldn\u2019t keep the venom out of his own, knowing that if he allowed her to see through his anger to his own pain and confusion, she would think that what she had done was okay, and he was too furious with her to allow her to think that yet.</p><p>\u201cYou mean you made it, without my consent.\u201d He could barely look at her. He didn\u2019t want to see her tears\u2014he hated her tears\u2014but he could hear them in her gasp and in her voice when she spoke.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re being like this,\u201d she cried. \u201cI didn\u2019t plan this, it just happened. Our birth control failed. I asked the doctor and he said that if I\u2019d had a stomach virus or anything like that it could provide a window of opportunity. And you know that I was sick a couple of days before your company party three months ago.\u201d Damn her, she was trying to cover her tracks. He strode out of the conservatory and downstairs into their en suite, while she trotted behind him, still trying to tell him about a stomach bug that she had had three months ago. How the hell could she expect him to remember something like that, anyway? He pushed back the niggling voice that told him he did remember it and that he had pampered her ridiculously while she had been sick. Instead, he convinced himself that he couldn\u2019t recall whatever insignificant bug she was referring to. He opened the medicine chest and yanked out her birth-control pills.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d She sounded scared and appalled as she watched him count the pills in the box. His eyes clouded over with a haze of red when he realized that the numbers were right.</p><p>\u201cGod, have you been chucking pills down the drain every night?\u201d he wondered out loud, hating himself even as he asked the question.</p> <p>\u201cYou know I wouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d she defended urgently.</p><p>\u201cIs that so? I obviously don\u2019t know you as well as I thought I did, do I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you know me, Bryce.\u201d she laid a tentative hand on his rigid forearm, and his flesh burned beneath the contact. He yanked his arm away and turned away from her. His eyes flooded with tears, he needed time to think, but he couldn\u2019t think with her standing in the same room, not when she was crying, not when he was the one responsible for her tears. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGet out of here,\u201d he whispered harshly, wanting her out of the room, not wanting her to hear or see how much he ached to take her into his arms.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet the hell out,\u201d he snarled, bracing himself before turning to face her. He barely kept himself from flinching when he saw her tears. \u201cGo now.\u201d She uttered a low cry and whirled from the room, fleeing as quickly as she could. Bryce finally allowed himself to break, sinking back against a tiled wall as his legs gave out and sliding down to the floor. He clasped his head in his hands and shook uncontrollably as he tried to imagine his life from this point on.</p><p>CHAPTER TEN</p> <p>Bryce had to go in to the office the following morning\u2014the day of Bronwyn\u2019s Big Date. He hadn\u2019t done so in months, but he and Pierre had an urgent meeting with a very important client and the man had requested Bryce\u2019s presence. As he was the business\u2019s CFO and Vice President of Marketing, Bryce knew that it was time to pick up the reins of his life again. He had responsibilities to Pierre, their employees, their clients, and to himself. It was time but it was just unfortunate timing. Celeste was down with the flu, Bronwyn had a test, also her all-important date was that night, and Bryce wasn\u2019t about to bail on this fatherhood business just because things got a little sticky. He hadn\u2019t even told Bronwyn about this meeting, but he figured that she had coped with much worse crises over the past couple of years, so he could deal with this one all on his own.</p><p>That meant taking Kayla into the office and she was in a terrible mood. He dressed her in her prettiest pink frock, promising her all kinds of treats if she just did this one thing for Daddy today. He didn\u2019t need his hearing to know that she was muttering a whole lot of \u201cKayla no want tos\u201d into his hair as he tied the laces on the tiny red sneakers she\u2019d insisted on wearing with the girly little dress. He\u2019d relented on the shoes because he was getting pretty sick of trying to reason with her. Bad parenting, he knew, but it was a matter of picking his battles, and he was running late. He was also terrified of losing his temper with her while there was no one else around and wanted to get out of the house and to the office as soon as humanly possible.</p><p>By the time Cal\u2014who also acted as his driver these days\u2014parked the car in the underground parking lot of the huge building in Central Cape Town, which hosted DCP Jewellers Inc., he was exhausted and feeling more than a little harassed. Petulant, angry tears were seeping down his daughter\u2019s rosy cheeks, and he could more than imagine her nagging crying. He knew her well enough by now to know when she was acting up and when she was just being difficult.</p><p>\u201cKayla.\u201d He hoped his voice was firm enough. \u201cStop crying. You\u2019re going meet some nice, new friends.\u201d She was shaking her head in response to his promise, and he could read her lips well enough to understand that she didn\u2019t want \u201cnew fwends.\u201d He groaned and dropped a kiss on one wet, chubby cheek.</p><p>\u201cOf course you want new friends.\u201d His plan was to drop her off at the company\u2019s day-care center. Quite a few of the young executives who were present stopped in their tracks to stare as he made his way through reception. He nodded at them abruptly, not caring for the open-mouthed shock they were all displaying but knowing that his presence, especially with a toddler in tow, would fuel gossip for months to come. They were naturally curious because not many of them had seen him since his accident; also God only knew how much noise Kayla was making. Pierre loomed in front of him and grinned as his eyes dropped to the fractious child on Bryce\u2019s hip.</p> <p>\u201cHello, Mikayla,\u201d he smiled down at her, signing so that Bryce could catch what he was saying. \u201cWhy so grumpy?\u201d He reached over and tried to tug the resisting child into his arms. Kayla refused to go, burying her wet face against Bryce\u2019s neck and tightening her small, surprisingly strong arms around his shoulders. Bryce met Pierre\u2019s amused eyes and groaned.</p><p>\u201cA little help, if you please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, mine isn\u2019t old enough to throw tantrums yet.\u201d Pierre shrugged, dropping his hands into his trouser pockets and rocking back on his heels. \u201cI have no idea how to deal with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking her to the nursery but she\u2019s going to hate me for deserting her,\u201d Bryce informed as he hugged the crying child closer.</p><p>\u201cBy the time you fetch her again, she\u2019ll be having so much fun, she\u2019ll cry when you try to take her home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, this parenting business is tough,\u201d Bryce muttered. \u201cI don\u2019t know how the hell Bronwyn coped on her own for two years.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why Mother\u2019s Day is so much bigger than Father\u2019s Day will ever be,\u201d Pierre quipped. \u201cI\u2019m off to the Mezzanine Conference Room; meet you there in ten minutes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Bryce agreed. Naturally, that was easier said than done. Kayla stubbornly clung to his leg when he set her down in the nursery, and he and one of the nursery school teachers tried desperately to bribe and cajole her into letting go. Twenty minutes later, exhausted and rumpled, Bryce made his way into the Mezzanine Conference Room, troubled that he\u2019d had to leave his crying and begging daughter behind and wondering how often Bronwyn had had to go through the same ordeal over the past two years. How difficult it must have been for her, especially being able to hear Kayla\u2019s begging and crying, when she turned to walk away.</p><p>His first big business meeting outside of his home, after the accident, was not as tough as he\u2019d expected it to be, largely due to the sign language interpreter Pierre had thoughtfully employed. The same woman would be Bryce\u2019s new assistant and would ease his transition back into the office. He still intended to spend a lot more time at home than before the accident, but the meeting made him realize just how much he\u2019d missed being in the thick of things and at the heart of the deal. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bronwyn could barely focus on what Raymond was saying; her mind kept straying back to the lonely image of Bryce sitting in front of that television with her image frozen on-screen. There was something so stark, sad, and desolate about the memory that it ate her up inside every time she thought about it.</p><p>\u201cYou seem preoccupied.\u201d Raymond\u2019s gentle voice intruded on her thoughts, and Bronwyn was startled back to the present and the man sitting opposite her. He really was a nice man, tall, lean, and almost handsome, with dark eyes, slightly thinning black hair, and a warm smile. Bronwyn really liked him but not enough to seriously consider dating him.</p><p>\u201cI think this was a mistake,\u201d she mumbled, and he frowned. \u201cIt\u2019s too soon. It just doesn\u2019t feel right for me to be out with you.\u201d He smiled in understanding.</p><p>\u201cI was wondering where your mind was,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe . . .\u201d she began, and he covered one of her helplessly fluttering hands with his own.</p><p>\u201cSome other time?\u201d he completed, and she nodded gratefully. \u201cThat\u2019s okay. I can wait until you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>The crazy thing was Bronwyn wasn\u2019t sure if she would ever be ready. Despite everything that had happened, she still loved Bryce, and she didn\u2019t know how to stop. While his past behavior had been unforgivable, it had also been completely out of character. How could the man who now loved his daughter so unreservedly have rejected the idea of Bronwyn\u2019s pregnancy in the first place? It made no sense. And yet, while she was confused and conflicted, she still couldn\u2019t forget about or forgive those two years that she had struggled to keep both herself and her baby alive and safe. She loved him and yet she resented him for abandoning them so completely. And there was just no way she could reconcile those two conflicting feelings in any kind of emotionally satisfying manner.</p><p>\u201cThank you for understanding, Raymond.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019m not disappointed, Bronwyn. I would still like to get to know you better and spend time with you. I hope I get that chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a really nice man, Raymond,\u201d she responded. \u201cBut I shouldn\u2019t have come out with you. I\u2019m still married, and while my husband may not be perfect, he\u2019s the father of my child and at one point, he was my whole life. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing here. I can\u2019t make any promises, you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d He smiled again, squeezing her hand in reassurance. \u201cI hope you know that I\u2019m here, as a friend. If you need a shoulder to cry on or someone to listen, I\u2019m always here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered, trying desperately to blink back her tears at his graceful acceptance of the situation.</p><p>Bryce, who sat alone in the darkened den, was startled when the unmistakable flash of headlights coming up the drive disturbed the unrelenting dark. He jumped up and stepped out onto the wide balcony that overlooked the driveway, knowing that he would not be spotted in the dark. It was Bronwyn, home a lot sooner than he had expected. She was standing beside the car, her head bent over her bag as she fumbled for her house keys. He frowned, making a mental note to talk to her about her carelessness. She really should have her keys out before she got out of her car; they had the best security money could buy, and there were guards all over the property, but he still didn\u2019t want her taking unnecessary risks. He could see her clearly in the light that was spilling from the front porch, and his stomach clenched at how beautiful she looked in the pale blue wraparound skirt that molded to her long legs with every move she made. Her white top dipped low enough to show off her modest cleavage and it set his blood boiling. She looked too provocative, too bloody tempting! He was sure that the pervert professor could not possibly have kept his hands to himself.</p><p>Burning up with the need to know if that bastard had laid his grubby paws on her, he made his way downstairs, sure he would be able to read her expression and know if she had let the man touch her. He just needed to know . . .</p> <p>\u201cHow was your date?\u201d The deep voice, sounding so unexpectedly from behind her, made Bronwyn jump in shock. She was busy setting the alarm and botched up the code when he startled her. She took a deep steadying breath and quickly reentered the correct code before turning to face him.</p><p>\u201cIt was fine,\u201d she murmured, knowing it was too dark for him to read her lips; she used her hands as well.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you get so good at signing?\u201d he asked huskily, stepping into the small pool of light in the hall and neatly trapping her between his body and the door.</p><p>\u201cAll those times I met Alice for lunch? Before going back to university? We were going to the same center Pierre went to for his sign language lessons. I go mostly on Saturdays now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She shrugged awkwardly, trying to step back when he took a small step forward but finding herself with no place to go when her back hit the door. He was so close she could feel his body heat and smell his wonderfully clean scent.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI wanted to be able to talk to you.\u201d He very gently lifted his thumb and forefinger to her chin and used it to tilt her face up to his.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t catch that,\u201d he whispered. She repeated her previous statement and his eyes darkened.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to talk to me? Despite the way I\u2019ve treated you?\u201d There was a world of vulnerability in his voice, and Bronwyn tried not to let it disarm her.</p> <p>\u201cI know how it feels to have no one to talk to,\u201d she said, closing her eyes to hide her pain from him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh God, sweetheart . . . Bron . . .\u201d The anguish in his voice undid her, and she found herself unable to resist when he lowered his head and rested his forehead against hers. His warm breath washed over her face, her lips, and she shuddered before going up onto her toes and brushing his mouth with hers. He went so still that she thought he would shatter, but when she moved her small hands up to cup his face, his breath escaped on a strangled sob. He tentatively wrapped his strong arms around her slender body to gather her close and responded to her sweet kiss with unbelievable tenderness and reverence. The kiss did not last long; it was over before it properly began, and Bryce took a step back, lifting a hand to gently palm one of her cheeks, his eyes bright with some inscrutable emotion. Bronwyn tilted her face into his hand and lifted her own much smaller hand to cover his. They stood that way for what seemed like an eternity but what was, in reality, only a few seconds before Bronwyn stepped around him. She left without a word, unable to find the right words, not even sure if there were words for what she was feeling.</p><p>Bryce groaned the following morning, when his boisterous twenty-one-month-old daughter bounced her way onto his bed at some ungodly hour. One sharp little knee narrowly missed his groin to land painfully on his abdomen, causing him to curse softly under his breath as he doubled over in pain.</p><p>\u201cKayla, honey, why don\u2019t you go find your mummy? It\u2019s her day off today.\u201d He caught her to stop her bouncing and planted a quick kiss on her soft cheek. She giggled at the feel of his stubble.</p><p>\u201cTickley.\u201d She formed the word clearly as she rubbed her cheek squeamishly.</p> <p>\u201cGo and wake Mummy up, sweetheart; Daddy\u2019s trying to sleep. I\u2019ll give you some sweeties if you go to your mummy!\u201d He cajoled.</p><p>\u201cSee fishies.\u201d He frowned at that bit of information, wondering what the hell he was missing in translation. He often had trouble with voiced and unvoiced consonants, but he doubted very much that she meant \u201cvishies,\u201d so the word had to be \u201cfishies,\u201d which confused the hell out of him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFishies, Daddy, see fishies!\u201d She made a squirmy, fishlike movement with one of her plump hands. Okay, so he definitely hadn\u2019t misread the \u201cfishies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your mummy?\u201d He kept her still when it became obvious that she wanted to bounce again.</p> <p>\u201cThere,\u201d she pointed to his bedroom door, the dimple she\u2019d inherited from him deepening as her smile widened. He looked up to find Bronwyn standing in the open doorway. Well that certainly explained how Kayla had gotten into his room; she wasn\u2019t tall enough to open doors yet. Bronwyn was leaning against the doorjamb with her arms folded over her chest and her eyebrows raised.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think I missed that blatant bit of bribery just now,\u201d she said, and he groaned.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, Bron, you know the weekends are your domain. I didn\u2019t want to rob you of any time with our precious little angel. It wouldn\u2019t be fair to you,\u201d he quickly smooth-talked, but she wasn\u2019t having any of it and he could practically hear her hah! Their high-strung \u201cangel\u201d of a daughter had escaped his grip and was jumping on the bouncy mattress again, her curls flying as she chanted, \u201cFishies, fishies\u201d with every bounce. Bryce grimaced as he read her lips.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s all this about \u2018fishies\u2019?\u201d he asked, feeling ridiculous as he said the word. He glanced up and caught Bronwyn staring at his naked chest. She blushed when he caught her staring and took a few seconds to gather her thoughts before responding.</p><p>\u201cUh . . . I\u2019m taking her to the aquarium today and was wondering if you\u2019d like to join us.\u201d He blinked up at her, wondering if he had read that right.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>She repeated the question, using her eloquent hands this time, and he blinked again, more than a little shocked by the unexpected invitation. Her blush deepened and she started to say that he didn\u2019t have to if he didn\u2019t want to, but he quickly brushed that aside before she changed her mind completely.</p><p>\u201cSure! I\u2019ve never been! That would be great! Kayla will love it!\u201d He knew he was speaking in exclamations but he didn\u2019t want any misunderstanding. \u201cGive me ten minutes and we can head off.\u201d He jumped out of bed, forgetting that he was wearing nothing but skin and quickly grabbed a sheet to preserve modesty when he felt a breeze on areas best kept covered in the presence of his little girl and his estranged wife. Tucking the sheet in at his waist, he grabbed Kayla while she was in midjump and hugged her to his chest, twirling her around for a couple of seconds. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see the fishies, baby!\u201d He dropped a kiss on the toddler\u2019s cheek before setting her down, where she tottered dizzily before plonking down onto her butt. She laughed happily after the dizziness passed and held up her arms to him for another round.</p><p>\u201cNot now, sweetie. I have to shower and then we\u2019re going to see all the pretty fishies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNebo?\u201d she asked worriedly, and he grinned at the thought of the Disney movie that she insisted on watching at least five times a week, with her daddy of course! Bryce was thankful for the subtitle option on DVDs and never thought he\u2019d be the type to recite the dialogue of a cartoon movie word for word in his lifetime.</p><p>\u201cYes, Nemo too,\u201d he promised. \u201cI\u2019ll be quick,\u201d he told Bron on his way out.</p><p>\u201cNo rush.\u201d She smiled. \u201cI still have to get Kayla ready. We can leave in about half an hour.\u201d</p><p>Bronwyn watched him leave, his broad tanned back rippling with muscles, the sheet molding his tight behind much too lovingly. Her mouth went dry as she recalled that flash of nudity; he was so gorgeous that it was a real shame to cover it up. She grinned as she recalled his near schoolboy giddiness at her impulsive invitation. She hadn\u2019t seen him that lighthearted and ecstatic in, well, ever really. Even before her pregnancy when they had been happy together, there had always been this reserve in him, a darkness that he had tried to keep hidden from her. She had always believed that it would only be a matter of time before he confided in her but then she had gotten pregnant and they had run out of time. She sighed at the dark turn of her thoughts; it was too bright and beautiful an autumn day to dwell on the past. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCome on, Kayla, time to get dressed.\u201d She held out her hand to the toddler who happily made her way over, still chattering excitedly about \u201cNebo\u201d and \u201cfishies.\u201d</p><p>The Two Oceans Aquarium was based at the V&amp;A Waterfront in Cape Town. It was teeming not only with marine life but with children, teens, students, and noisy families. Bryce and Bronwyn, as a young couple with an energetic toddler, blended in completely. For once the ubiquitous Cal and his team had been told to remain very much in the background. Bryce had commanded them to remain outside, despite Cal\u2019s obvious uneasiness with the high security risk such a busy place posed. Bryce had even chosen to drive them himself\u2014a rarity these days\u2014while the security team had remained a discreet distance behind them.</p><p>Now Bronwyn was achingly aware of how much like a normal family they must look amidst the tide of humanity. Kayla was up on Bryce\u2019s shoulders, and her little feet frantically paddled against his chest every time she wanted him to stop and let her down so that she could investigate something closer. She had loved the touch pool, where she got to stroke and touch all manner of tide-pool life: fish, starfish, and even a small octopus. She had squealed with every new sensation under her fingertips. Their little girl was nothing if not adventurous, and unlike a lot of the other children her age who backed off squealing and crying, she kept coming forward to touch something new. Of course, the highlight for her was the display of clownfish. The beautiful exhibit had actually been named \u201cNemos.\u201d Bryce had guided her into the little bubble beneath the display, which had afforded her a 360-degree view of the tank. She had squealed and clapped in delight when she found herself surrounded by so many \u201cNemos.\u201d It had been very difficult getting her back out to give other children a chance but she hadn\u2019t had time to sulk with so much to see and do.</p><p>Bronwyn sensed that, despite his laughter, something was not quite right with Bryce. He seemed jumpy and sweat beaded his upper lip. She often caught him looking around frantically when she was farther away from him and then almost noticeably sagging in relief when he caught sight of her. At first she was confused by his uncharacteristic lack of composure, but then she caught the way he shrank away anytime someone brushed by him or got too close. With startling clarity, she recognized that her husband, who had once seemed so strong and infallible, feared the milling crowd of people around them. She even suspected that he was mildly agoraphobic. It explained why he had confined himself to the house these past couple of years, why he rarely ventured out, and why he preferred having Pierre or Rick come by to see him at home. This once social creature had been cut off from the world in more ways than she had known. It said a lot for how much her invitation must have meant to him, if he was willing to brave this for a day out with her and Kayla.</p> <p>She made her way to his side and firmly slid her hand into his. His startled gaze met hers, and when he saw the understanding glimmering there, his eyes shone with gratitude.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to go home?\u201d she asked, and he hesitated before shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay . . . now.\u201d He lifted their clasped hands gratefully.</p><p>Neither openly acknowledged the situation again, but she rarely left his side after that and he seemed less tense. He appeared to be genuinely enjoying himself by the time they reached the underwater tunnel that led them through a multitude of manta rays, barracudas, tuna, and ragged-toothed sharks. The display was so awesome that even Kayla went quiet as she took in the strange, beautiful blue world that surrounded her. Her little hands were clasped together under her father\u2019s jaw and Bronwyn watched as she started to droop more and more until her head was resting on top of Bryce\u2019s and she was fast asleep.</p><p>\u201cHold still,\u201d she urged, digging out the digital camera and taking yet another picture of father and daughter. He grinned before taking the camera from her and stopping a passing tourist, asking the man to take their picture. He shifted Kayla so that she was cradled in his right arm, her head resting on the curve of his shoulder and her arm draped around his neck, and he hauled Bronwyn against his left side, wrapping his arm around her waist and holding her close.</p> <p>\u201cSmile, sweetheart,\u201d he urged into her ear, and she was startled into obeying. The tourist took three pictures in quick succession before handing the camera back to Bryce.</p><p>\u201cYou have a great-looking family, mate,\u201d he said in a thick Aussie accent before handing back the camera and heading off with a wave.</p><p>When they left the aquarium, Bryce pushed Kayla\u2019s cart while Bronwyn tucked her hand into the crook of his elbow to maintain contact. Cal and his team were taking their brief to remain discreet so seriously that Bronwyn didn\u2019t even see them. Bryce led the way toward one of the many restaurants dotting the waterfront, a Greek place that served fabulous food, and they sat down at a table beneath one of the umbrellas out in the early autumn sunshine. They were quiet for a while, watching the world go by, until Bryce broke the silence.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>She lifted surprised eyes to his solemn face. \u201cFor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEarlier.\u201d He cleared his throat and she watched his Adam\u2019s apple bob sexily as he swallowed. \u201cThank you for earlier. Crowds are . . . difficult for me. Ever since the accident I can\u2019t stand being in large crowds. It\u2019s so bizarre. There I am with all these people around me and I know there should be noise, voices, footsteps, and laughter, but instead there\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s like being in a huge void, until I\u2019m jostled and then it feels like being ambushed because I didn\u2019t see or hear it coming. After the accident I was so paranoid, I kept wondering who was behind me, kept imagining someone was there, and I\u2019d turn around so quickly that I\u2019d startle everyone around me, only there\u2019d be no one there, but I\u2019d immediately get the same feeling and turn again. I knew that it would only be a matter of time before it would get to the point where I\u2019d just keep turning round and round and round until I went insane. So before that could happen I . . .\u201d</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou shut yourself in,\u201d she completed, and he nodded.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s crazy, I know,\u201d he confessed, and she smiled with a shake of her head, covering his lightly trembling hand with her own.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. You lost one of your senses, Bryce. Naturally there\u2019d be physical, mental, and emotional repercussions. I read that people go through the stages of grief after losing their hearing. Did you . . . did you talk to anyone after the accident?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean a psychiatrist?\u201d he clarified dryly. \u201cI was seeing one for nearly a year; it\u2019s because of him that I was able to even contemplate coming out today. I was so much worse immediately after the accident and I very stubbornly refused to talk to anyone. Yes, I was in denial and furious that something like this could have happened to me, but I shoved it aside because I had something bigger to take care of. I was adamant that talking to shrinks could wait. But Pierre and Rick kind of forced my hand. They blackmailed me into seeing someone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow?\u201d she asked, curious. One thing she knew about her stubborn husband was that when he made up his mind about something, it was very difficult to get him to change it again. He cleared his throat and gulped down a healthy mouthful of white wine.</p><p>\u201cAt the time, my sole purpose was to find you,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut I was so incapacitated and the only two people I trusted to help me with that were Rick and Pierre. They had private detectives working on it and because of my antisocial phobias, they were the ones who dealt with those detectives. They threatened to stop acting as liaisons between the detectives and me if I didn\u2019t see someone. I couldn\u2019t let that happen, and since I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to deal with the detectives myself, I had no choice but to comply with their demands. I resented the hell out of them for imposing that ultimatum, but in the end, Bron, they saved my sanity.\u201d They remained silent for a while after that, while Bronwyn thought about everything that he had revealed.</p><p>\u201cAnd the . . . the deafness is permanent?\u201d She asked the question that she had been too scared to broach before and winced at the immense of amount of pain that darkened his eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing they can do about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo put it in the simplest of terms, I suffered major nerve damage in both ears. I hit my head so hard that the doctors told me I was lucky that deafness was my only major, lasting injury. Lucky, can you believe that?\u201d His voice rang with outrage at the memory, and he shut his eyes briefly before shaking his head and meeting her eyes again. \u201cThey told me that the damage to my right ear is less catastrophic and said that an operation might restore some of the function.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t work?\u201d she asked sympathetically, aching for him. What he had done to her was unforgivable, but he had paid in spades for it already, and she found herself unable to hate or resent him any longer. She just felt numb and confused.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have the operation,\u201d He shrugged and she blinked. Stunned by that information.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seemed pointless.\u201d His jaw was set, and while she longed to prompt him for more information, she sensed that he wouldn\u2019t be receptive to any more questions. She sighed, his stubbornness and uncommunicativeness merely serving to remind her of why she felt their marriage no longer stood a chance of working. Yes, he had paid for his unforgivable and baffling reaction to her pregnancy, but they had so many other insurmountable problems.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry that this happened to you, Bryce,\u201d she said earnestly. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the only one who suffered, Bron.\u201d For the first time since it happened, he was brushing it off because there was so much more he needed to know about what had happened to her during those lost years. \u201cAfter you left the hospital, what happened? Where did you go? Who took care of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t want to talk about this,\u201d she began hesitantly.</p> <p>\u201cPlease.\u201d The single, softly spoken word undid her more than any other could have, and she lowered her eyes to her peacefully sleeping daughter before lifting them back to Bryce.</p><p>\u201cThanks to selling the car, I had enough money for a few months\u2019 rent and food. Luckily Kayla was a healthy baby, and I didn\u2019t have to worry about extra doctor\u2019s bills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you? How were you after her birth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe coped, Bryce,\u201d she said. \u201cI stayed home for a month and a half and my next-door neighbor, Linda, would often drop by to do some of the cooking for me. The first few times I went out job-hunting, Linda babysat Kayla for me. Eventually I got the job in Plettenberg Bay, where I ran into Rick and Lisa, and the rest is history.\u201d The censorious glint in his eyes told her what he thought of the huge gaps in her story.</p><p>\u201cWhere did Kayla stay while you were at work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLinda usually took care of her but Linda was elderly, and she . . . she died just before Rick found me. I got sick soon after her death, and the day I ran into Rick was my first day back at work. I hadn\u2019t found a replacement for Linda and had to hire a babysitter for the day.\u201d Her situation had been utterly desperate. Heartbroken over her friend\u2019s death, broke, and sick, she was at her wits\u2019 end. If Rick had not found her that day, she didn\u2019t know what she would have done. Odds were she would have lost her job that day anyway as she had been making too many mistakes.</p><p>Bryce didn\u2019t need her to spell it out to understand how bad the situation had been, and a grim silence settled over them while they contemplated their roast lamb and potatoes, appetites lost. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow was your health after her birth, Bron?\u201d he asked again, alerting her to the fact that he had noticed her earlier evasiveness on that matter.</p><p>\u201cIt was . . . I wasn\u2019t . . .\u201d</p><p>He maintained steady eye contact, and she bit her bottom lip before shrugging and giving him the brutal, unvarnished truth. \u201cI was often sick. I was weak after giving birth and didn\u2019t get enough rest after taking Kayla home from the hospital. I was up at all hours, feeding and changing her, and then I was back at work. I never fully recovered and couldn\u2019t afford health care for myself since all of my money was assigned to buying food and clothes for Kayla. I ate leftovers at work whenever I could and the odd sandwich when I couldn\u2019t. It sounds worse than it was, Bryce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo when you got the flu . . .\u201d He left the statement unfinished and she nodded.</p> <p>\u201cYes, it raged out of control because my immune system had taken such a beating in the past. The day Rick found me, the only reason I was at work was because Gerhard would have given my job to someone else if I\u2019d missed one more day, and I wasn\u2019t getting paid for staying at home. I couldn\u2019t afford the doctor and had been fending off the flu with cheap over-the-counter stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBron,\u201d he began.</p><p>\u201cI know it was irresponsible, Bryce. I know that I had a baby to take care of and I could have gotten seriously ill or worse\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were seriously ill,\u201d he interrupted, but she continued as if there hadn\u2019t been an interruption.</p><p>\u201cBut I was taking care of her the only way I knew how; I was keeping her fed, healthy, and happy. I needed to work, you understand? I\u2019d made arrangements in case anything happened to me; I made sure that the authorities would know to call you, for Kayla\u2019s sake. I wouldn\u2019t have left her alone. I knew that you\u2019d take her if I wasn\u2019t part of the package. I knew that you\u2019d love her and take care of her.\u201d He seemed at a loss and frowned down at his plate before sighing tiredly and scrubbing his hands over his face.</p> <p>\u201cGod,\u201d he groaned wearily. \u201cHow did we ever get to this point?\u201d He reached over and stroked one long finger down the side of her face. \u201cEat, sweetheart. I never want you to go hungry again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d She couldn\u2019t resist the naked pleading on his face, and she smiled before nodding and lifting her fork, her appetite restored. He remained quiet for a while longer, breaking the silence to tell her an amusing story about taking Kayla into the office the previous day. He peppered the story with wry humor, and she found herself laughing more than she\u2019d laughed in a long time. Eventually they started talking about other things\u2014university and work\u2014and for a short while, it felt as companionable and comfortable as it had been in the past.</p><p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p><p>Is she asleep?\u201d Bryce asked when Bronwyn joined him in the den after putting Kayla down for the night. She nodded in response to the question and tried not to let the intimate domesticity of the scene unnerve her too much. He was sprawled on one of the huge comfortable sofas that Bronwyn had begged him to buy when she had first seen it, four years ago.</p><p>\u201cYes, she was still going on about \u2018Nebo\u2019 when she dropped off.\u201d</p> <p>He smiled faintly at that.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s going to forget about today too quickly,\u201d he murmured, fingering the rim of the glass of scotch he had poured for himself, indicating a glass of red wine on the little table beside the sofa. \u201cWine?\u201d</p><p>Not wanting to refuse and end the comfortable atmosphere between them just yet, she nodded and curled up on the opposite end of the large sofa, tucking her feet beneath her.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be wonderful if today turned out to be her first real memory?\u201d He smiled faintly at her dreamy question.</p><p>\u201cIt would be a happy one for all of us,\u201d he agreed. He tilted his head to look at her appraisingly, and she met his eyes with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your first memory?\u201d he asked, and she giggled.</p><p>\u201cChasing a butterfly around our backyard, tripping over the puppy and falling down, hard. According to my Gran, I was three when it happened. She remembered because it was at my birthday party and I made such a fuss because I thought I\u2019d hurt the dog. Apparently I insisted that we take him to the \u2018doggy doctor\u2019!\u201d</p> <p>His eyes crinkled at the corners.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d she asked him, still smiling at her own memory. \u201cWhat was your first memory?\u201d The smile faded from his eyes to be replaced by a somber frown as he shrugged.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at that. \u201cIt\u2019s your first memory. By its very definition you should remember it.\u201d He looked uncomfortable and refused to meet her eyes. Realizing that something was wrong, she tried to catch his eye.</p><p>\u201cBryce?\u201d she prompted, waving her hand to get his attention and not expecting much in the line of a response from him. If this followed the old pattern of their marriage, he would freeze her out and retreat back behind the walls that seemed to have been specifically designed to keep her out. It amazed her now, how little she actually knew of the man and merely brought home the fact how much was still wrong, how much would always be wrong, with their relationship. She was just resigning herself to watching him get up and leave when he unexpectedly spoke, still not looking at her.</p><p>\u201cMy first memory is of my father. He\u2019s shouting at me and angry because I\u2019d accidentally dropped his wristwatch into a toilet bowl. Can\u2019t really blame him\u2014it\u2019s a gold watch. Of course, I wasn\u2019t aware of the significance of that at the time. I was three as well. I know because that was the same day I broke my arm . . . so there are records of the date,\u201d he said it almost absently, and Bronwyn\u2019s brow furrowed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow did you break your arm?\u201d she asked, but he wasn\u2019t looking at her and didn\u2019t see the question. She reached over and in a gesture similar to the one he\u2019d used on her the previous night, gently tilted his jaw so that he was looking at her. She repeated the question and he seemed to shake himself out of his reverie, but when he spoke again, his voice was so horribly empty.</p><p>\u201cHe was very angry,\u201d he said with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cYour father broke your arm?\u201d She needed clarity on this point and wasn\u2019t sure she understood. He nodded abruptly before draining his glass.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m exhausted,\u201d he muttered gruffly. \u201cI was wondering, would you and Kayla like to go to the beach with me tomorrow? I\u2019ll fix a picnic lunch. Unless you\u2019ve moved your ladies\u2019 get-together to tomorrow? Since you missed it today?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA couple of the others had other plans this weekend as well, so we decided not to meet until next week. Anyway, the beach sounds nice,\u201d she agreed absently, not really paying attention, her mind on what he had just revealed. He smiled before getting up abruptly.</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d He sounded pleased. \u201cIt\u2019ll be an early-ish start. I think eight o\u2019clock should do it.\u201d He turned to head out of the door, then hesitated and turned back to her. He leaned over her.</p><p>\u201cThank you for today, Bron,\u201d he said sincerely, bending down to drop an unexpectedly sweet kiss onto her opened mouth. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, wait. Bryce . . .\u201d But he was already striding away, leaving her to fret over the unexpected information he had divulged about his father. Had it been an accident? Or deliberate? The latter possibility left her cold and unable to fall asleep for the longest time.</p><p>Bronwyn woke to the conspiratorial sound of whispering just outside her door, and a bleary-eyed look at her bedside clock told that her it was seven thirty a.m. She groaned at the thought of getting Kayla up and ready in time for Bryce\u2019s early start. She was exhausted after an uneasy night\u2019s sleep. She cleared her throat and frowned when the whispering outside her door continued. She pushed herself up when the door handle turned slowly and braced for an energetic wake-up call similar to the one Bryce had received the day before. She leaned forward when nothing happened; the whispering continued for a few more moments before her daughter\u2019s dimpled face appeared around the door. When the little girl caught sight of her mother, she gasped and abruptly jerked back out of sight.</p> <p>\u201cMummy not sleep!\u201d Bronwyn heard the toddler hiss frantically before she was shushed by an unmistakeable, deep voice that always managed to send delicious shivers down her spine. Intrigued now, Bronwyn leaned even farther forward, wondering what they were up to. After another few moments of whispered exchanges, Kayla stepped around the door, already dressed in a pair of pink denim dungarees, a yellow-and-pink T-shirt, and her favorite pair of red squeak sneakers. In her hands she solemnly clasped a handful of multicolored autumn flowers, which Bronwyn recognized from the garden outside.</p><p>\u201cHello, Mummy.\u201d She grinned.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, sweetheart. What do you have there?\u201d The little girl solemnly handed her the flowers before leaning up on tiptoes to kiss her mother on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cHappy Mummy day,\u201d the little girl said carefully in a well-rehearsed way.</p><p>\u201cMummy\u2019s day? But . . .\u201d She glanced up to see Bryce standing in the doorway with a tray clasped in his hands, her eyes huge and vulnerable in her face as she tried to figure out what on earth was going on here. \u201cBryce, it\u2019s not . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes it is. You\u2019ve missed out on two, so Kayla and I are making up for lost time.\u201d He placed the tray in her lap and removed the flowers from her numb fingers to place them in the empty vase on the tray, before moving the vase to her nightstand. He dropped a kiss on her cheek. \u201cHappy Mother\u2019s Day, Bronwyn.\u201d</p> <p>Kayla solemnly held up a small gift-wrapped box, and when Bronwyn opened it she frowned in confusion.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d It was an electronic beeper-like device nestled in a custom-molded Styrofoam cushion.</p><p>\u201cThe smart key to your new car,\u201d he informed with a slight smile, and her eyes widened when she turned the small device over and spotted the prominent BMW logo on the other side of the key.</p><p>\u201cBryce, this is too much,\u201d she protested helplessly.</p><p>\u201cThis is nowhere near enough,\u201d he interrupted gruffly. \u201cNothing I do can ever be enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d she said, unable to read his mood and not sure how to react.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say anything.\u201d He grinned, flashing a dimple identical to his daughter\u2019s and looking just as mischievous as the toddler. \u201cJust enjoy the car. It\u2019s not quite as sporty as the last one you had; I wanted something bigger and safer because of Kayla.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut when did you . . .\u201d She couldn\u2019t seem to gather her thoughts, and his smile widened.</p> <p>\u201cI started shopping when you told me about how you were forced to sell the last one. It was delivered yesterday, but the visit to the aquarium kind of distracted me. I figured you must be sick of that Jeep by now. I know you\u2019re not a fan of it.\u201d She nodded dumbly in response to that observation, still staring blankly down at the key in her hand. Bored with the lack of attention, Kayla started tugging at her father\u2019s hand. He glanced down at her and signed something to her that Bronwyn didn\u2019t quite catch. Whatever it was seemed to satisfy the little girl because she grudgingly settled down</p><p>\u201cTake your time getting ready,\u201d he told her. \u201cKayla and I will be downstairs packing our picnic. It\u2019s going to be a beautiful day; sunny, with blue skies and not a single cloud on the horizon.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His prediction proved accurate; it was a beautiful day, the most perfect day Bronwyn had ever spent with Bryce. After leading them down to Bronwyn\u2019s gorgeous, sleek, new silver sedan, he told her that she would be doing the driving. He had only Cal on security and\u2014always a consummate professional\u2014the man was keeping such a low profile that Bronwyn was barely aware of him in the discreet black sedan parked a few meters away from them.</p><p>A little nervous about test-driving the new car in front of one of the worst backseat drivers that she had ever met, she tried to demur. Unfortunately, he wouldn\u2019t have it, and after strapping Kayla into the baby seat that was already installed in the back, he made quite a show of settling in on the passenger side. Bronwyn rolled her eyes and headed for the driver\u2019s side, prepared for a day\u2019s worth of male condescension from him.</p><p>She was rather pleasantly surprised that he valiantly refrained from commenting when she had problems starting the keyless car. He kept a bright smile glued to his face when she ground the clutch and the car lurched forward and limped out of the driveway. She sent a nervous glance at his profile after she had finally managed to get them down to Main Street and could tell that his smile was beginning to fray at the edges after less than five minutes in the car. She bit back an irreverent chuckle before pulling the car over to the shoulder of the road. He glanced over at her in alarm and she smiled at him sweetly.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to drive?\u201d she invited, and he grinned sheepishly.</p> <p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re doing fine. I\u2019m sorry if I seem tense. It\u2019s just that since the accident I\u2019ve been a bit nervous in cars. That\u2019s why I have Cal do most of my driving these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know where we\u2019re going, so it\u2019s better if you do the driving today,\u201d she said reasonably. \u201cI\u2019ll take over if you get tired or something.\u201d He shook his head placidly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be okay,\u201d he assured her. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter if I\u2019m driving or not, I\u2019m still uneasy in a car,\u201d he grudgingly explained, and she could see how much it cost him to reveal that weakness to her. \u201cI\u2019ll give you directions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, but keep the wincing down to a minimum, mister,\u201d she warned. \u201cYou\u2019ve always been a terrible backseat driver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d He looked so genuinely baffled that she snorted in exasperation and restarted the car.</p> <p>Following his directions and ignoring his occasional grimaces and harshly indrawn breaths, she drove them safely to Boulder\u2019s Beach where Bryce spent most of the morning trying to keep Kayla away from the penguins. Bronwyn laughed helplessly at their antics. Kayla turned it into a game, running from her father while she tried to pet one of the many wild penguins that fearlessly waddled around on the beach, completely ignoring his warnings that they would bite. At around twelve, when it was too hot to remain on the beach, they packed up and he directed her to the wine lands of Stellenbosch. Bronwyn was becoming more confident in her handling of the car and was grinding the gears less often, which in turn meant a more relaxed Bryce. They had a picnic lunch in one of the beautiful privately owned vineyards in the picturesque Stellenbosch.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful here,\u201d Bronwyn observed dreamily as she tilted her head back to enjoy the sun filtering through the leaves of the giant oak tree that they were picnicking beneath. They were sitting up on a hill that overlooked a vast vineyard. The vines were starting to go vivid shades of orange and red and made the entire valley look like it was aflame in the afternoon sunshine. \u201cAnd peaceful. How did you know about this place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe family of a business acquaintance of mine owns this vineyard. I cleared this with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnybody I know?\u201d she asked, tucking her feet beneath her and rummaging through the picnic basket that he had settled on the blanket.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d He shrugged. \u201cCord Strachan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs in Strachan Diamonds?\u201d Her eyes widened. The Strachan family was one of South Africa\u2019s wealthiest and most influential families. They controlled a huge chunk of the diamond mining industry in the country and the latest generation provided a rich source of fodder for local and international gossip columnists.</p> <p>\u201cThey supply most of our rough diamonds.\u201d He nodded. \u201cI remembered that Cord mentioned this place over one of our business lunches a couple of years ago.\u201d Before his accident, of course; any socializing had been done before his accident. The reminder saddened Bronwyn and the awkward silence that followed was entirely her fault. Luckily Kayla demanded attention and distracted them with her antics. Bryce kept the little girl entertained with silly games all through lunch, as Kayla had the natural tendency of a toddler to grow bored very easily. Eventually, after a companionable lunch, Bryce packed them all back into the car and directed her to drive the short distance to a small town called Klapmuts and there introduced them to a place Bronwyn had never known existed.</p><p>She stood in an enclosed tropical garden and gazed in awe at the hundreds of butterflies that fluttered around her. It was like watching a garden of wildflowers take flight, and Bronwyn could do nothing but stand and stare, her eyes filling with tears as their wings kissed her face and hair. Kayla was just as entranced. She was in her father\u2019s arms and reached out one chubby hand to try and capture the delicate creatures as they flitted by.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d Bronwyn breathed, lifting a trembling hand to her mouth. \u201cOh my God, Bryce . . .\u201d He couldn\u2019t hear her of course; he couldn\u2019t even see what she was saying as his attention was focused on the fragile creatures that were haphazardly darting from flower to flower and person to person. How dare he make this so difficult for her? Just when she had decided to contact the divorce lawyer, he did something so wonderfully tender and so unbelievably sweet. He knew that she loved butterflies, that she had always loved them. She had countless earrings, chains, charms, printed skirts, and blouses with butterflies scattered all over them. It would be so easy to believe that he had planned this day out of some manipulative need to keep her complacent. But when she looked up she found herself charmed by the arresting picture he made with his head tilted back and his eyes closed. He was lost in his own world, enjoying the sensation of the delicate butterfly wings brushing against his face, and Bronwyn instinctively knew that he had done this to make her happy. She stood on her toes to drop an impulsive kiss on his cheek and startled him into opening his eyes. He looked down at her quizzically. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis is perfect,\u201d she told him, and his eyes warmed. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He dropped an arm over her slender shoulders and gave her a quick, little one-armed hug.</p><p>\u201cI saw an advertisement for this place last winter and I knew that you\u2019d like it.\u201d Last winter? At least six months before her return? He had learned about this place and thought of her. Not with any hatred or resentment it seemed. Instead he had thought about something that would make her happy. It was startling to know that he hadn\u2019t always thought of her in anger over the last couple of years, and Bronwyn wasn\u2019t sure how to process that information.</p><p>They got home shortly before eight, and Kayla was once again drooping in exhaustion. Bryce took her from Bronwyn\u2019s arms.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll put her to bed,\u201d he offered.</p><p>\u201cBryce, you\u2019ve been taking care of her all week, I should\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve been taking care of her on your own for years. This is the least I can do,\u201d he interrupted, and she protested no further. She knew that he needed to make up for the past but that wasn\u2019t what she wanted from him anymore. They had to think of the future and ensure that it was a happy one for all of them. Bronwyn just couldn\u2019t live with his secrets any longer. And she was only human, so she still felt so much anger and bitterness toward him for misjudging her so horribly.</p><p>She went upstairs to take a hot shower, and when she headed toward the study later, she ran into Bryce as he was coming from the kitchen with a glass of fruit juice in his hand.</p><p>\u201cHitting the books?\u201d His deep, quiet voice sent a little tremor of awareness shivering up her spine. She shoved back the unwanted frisson of sexual awareness and forced herself to smile.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m doing research on an assignment due in a couple of weeks,\u201d she explained.</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t overtax yourself,\u201d he advised before heading upstairs. She saluted his back sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cYes sir,\u201d she said smartly before rolling her eyes at her own childishness and continuing on her way to the study. She didn\u2019t get much done before the rigors of the weekend caught up with her and her eyes drifted shut.</p><p>She came awake with a start when she felt strong arms encircling her and lifting her up.</p><p>\u201cWha . . . I was just taking a catnap,\u201d she protested groggily, somehow managing to speak clearly enough for him to read her lips.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been in here for nearly four hours, and judging from the computer screen, you\u2019ve done all of five minutes\u2019 worth of work. That wasn\u2019t a catnap, babe; you were completely out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust so tired,\u201d she murmured incoherently before snuggling up to his warm, strong, and naked chest. He must have been in bed until some instinct had told him to check on her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he soothed into her hair. \u201cSleep, sweetheart.\u201d She sighed contentedly, burrowed closer, and was asleep seconds after he\u2019d deposited her in bed.</p><p>It was still dark when she woke up, but the room was filling with the eerie gray light of the impending dawn. She soon recognized that she was in Bryce\u2019s room, in his bed, and wrapped in his arms. He lay spooning her, his knees tucked into the crook of hers, one strong arm snaked under her head and the other draped over her torso. His large hand was possessively spread over her abdomen. Bronwyn tried not to think about how incredibly right this felt and focused on extricating herself from his hold. She moved experimentally, but his arms flexed and his hand gently exerted a little bit more pressure on her stomach. She relaxed until she felt the tension seeping out of his arms and heard his breathing regulate again. Once she was sure he was still asleep, she subtly tried to move away again, but his reaction was the same as before. She sighed quietly and stilled her movements, wondering why he hadn\u2019t taken her to her own bed. She was still wearing the tank top she had donned after her shower the night before, but her sweatpants were missing. He must have removed them to make her more comfortable. This left her wearing only her tiny silk bikini panties, and judging from the expanse of hot, smooth male flesh pressed up against her back, Bryce wasn\u2019t wearing much more than a pair of boxers.</p><p>She groaned softly, knowing that she should try harder to remove herself from his arms, but it felt so good to be held by him that she was tempted to stay where she was. She carefully laid her hand over his where it rested low on her stomach and gently tried to lift it. His hand quite unexpectedly curled around hers and she jumped in response to the touch.</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to hold you.\u201d His voice rumbled in her ear. His hand briefly tightened around her smaller hand for a few seconds longer before he let her go and removed his arm from around her waist. He shifted away from her, giving her the space to leave if she so desired. Bronwyn hesitated for a brief moment, impulsively turning around to face him. She could barely make out his expression in the predawn light, and against her better judgment she reached out a hand to touch his stubbled jaw. His own hand lifted to trap her against the bristly surface of his skin. Her palm brushed against the lower edge of his sensuous lips.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t leave now, Bronwyn . . .\u201d He left the rest of the desperately whispered warning unspoken, and Bronwyn closed her eyes briefly, praying for the strength to get up and walk away. She steeled herself and gently dragged her hand out from under his.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d he whispered urgently, and she hesitated. He moved closer, bracing himself on one elbow to look down at her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I have to do this.\u201d Before she could react, his mouth found hers in an achingly sweet yet infinitely hungry kiss. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo sorry,\u201d he apologized again, when he lifted his mouth to stare down into her face tenderly before dropping back down to claim her lips again. His kiss was tender and loving and, as a result, Bronwyn found herself helplessly responding to it. Her lips opened up and welcomed him in and his tongue happily accepted the invitation, gently courting and coaxing hers.</p><p>His hands moved down the slim column of her neck, to her shoulders, stroking every centimeter of silky skin he encountered. His lips followed his hands down. She felt his hot, moist breath on her sensitive skin as he worked his way down, kissing every inch of available skin. She cried out when she felt his breath on one tautly beaded nipple through the thin cotton material of her top. His mouth moved over the nipple and he very deliberately breathed onto the bud through the cotton. The material sensuously abraded the sensitive peak, while his fingers fluttered up and down the small slope of her breast, circling, taunting but not quite touching the eager tip. Bronwyn sobbed desperately as she wondered how he had gotten her so hot, so fast. He glanced up into her face, over the small mound of the breast, and grinned almost satanically. He hovered for an endless moment before bending his head and drawing the tight nub of her nipple, cotton and all, deeply into his hot, wet mouth. At the same time he buried his free hand between her legs and found the other eager nubbin desperate for his touch through her silky underwear.</p><p>It was like being jolted by a huge bolt of lightning; she screamed and arched off the bed as she climaxed unexpectedly and with ferocious force. Her back bowed and she remained taut for what seemed like an eternity, as the spasms went on and on, while he drew her nipple deeper and deeper into his mouth. He had one hand cupped in the nape of her neck with the other still buried between her legs and kept them there even after she went completely boneless and collapsed back onto the bed. He lifted his head to chuckle hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so bloody gorgeous,\u201d he whispered as he gave her one final stroke with his long finger before moving his hand to rest on her heaving stomach. She barely heard him over the thunderous crashing of her heart. She could hardly move and she was only just aware of him dragging her top off and tossing it aside. He went back to work, kissing her skin, licking, sucking, and nipping reverently. Bronwyn tried to regain her equilibrium but it was an impossible task when Bryce was so determinedly keeping her off-kilter.</p><p>He was patient and undemanding and Bronwyn sighed dreamily, feeling ridiculously relaxed after her massive orgasm, while his sweeping hands and loving mouth continued to do deliciously wicked things to her. Gradually, his relentless patience started to have an undeniable effect on her. Her nipples had beaded back into tight, hard nuggets, and her breathing became more and more ragged as he kissed and caressed his way over her entire body, front and back. Her panties had long since disappeared, and she became sharply aware of that fact when his lips found their way to her flat stomach. His tongue swirled in and around the dent of her belly button, and she helplessly shifted her hips, encouraging him to move even lower. She was amazed by how quickly he had managed to get her so incredibly aroused again after her earlier climax.</p><p>All thought fled her mind when his talented mouth found the moist core of her femininity, and she shuddered violently with every stroke of his tongue. She barely had time to brace herself before a second, even bigger climax had her writhing around in ecstatic agony. He managed to still her helplessly thrusting hips between his large hands as he continued to lave her with his incredibly clever tongue.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d she whispered, unable to tolerate the overwhelming sensations for much longer, but of course he could not hear her and continued to relentlessly coax the almost painfully pleasurable response from her. He made her come again and again until Bronwyn, so overly sensitive after her repeated orgasms, had to pull at his hair to make him stop.</p><p>Bryce dragged himself up over her body and braced himself above her to stare down into her sweaty face. His eyes were smiling down into hers and he looked justifiably smug.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d she whispered after her climactic shudders eventually stopped. It was light enough now for him to read her lips, and his smile widened into a grin. She glanced down between their bodies and noticed that his boxers had disappeared and that he was still very aroused. She comprehended how incredibly one-sided this entire experience had been, and she reached down to touch him. He hissed when her fingers closed around him and groaned when she stroked his hard, hot length lazily.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he whispered, when she tried to guide him to her and she frowned up at him. \u201cI don\u2019t think it would be a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d she asked in confusion.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019ll hate me if we do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she denied. \u201cI won\u2019t. I\u2019m not that unfair, Bryce. We both want this. I want this. Please.\u201d He was helplessly thrusting himself against her hand and she once again tried to bring him to her.</p><p>\u201cNo, sweetheart,\u201d he managed tightly. \u201cJust your hand. We don\u2019t have to go further than that. Just your hand is fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she protested again. Why wouldn\u2019t he make love to her? Her hand loosened and he groaned before reaching down and tightening his own hand over hers.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let go,\u201d he begged hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cBryce, please make love to me.\u201d He groaned again and let go of her hand. She released him, her hands moving up to stroke and caress the rest of his body instead.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he apologized. \u201cI never meant for any of this to happen. I just wanted to hold you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d she appeased, kissing his chest and neck lovingly before raising her head to meet his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he whispered quietly. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d He hovered for a moment before, with a growl of brutal self-denial, he dragged himself out of her arms and off the bed all in one swift movement. He stood at the side of the bed, gloriously naked and painfully aroused, to stare at her for a heartbeat before turning away and heading toward the en suite. Bronwyn watched the door close gently behind him and an instant later, heard the shower going on. She turned her face into the pillow with an anguished sob and wondered at the amount of self-control it must have taken for him to get up and leave her. She was tempted to join him in the shower, but she knew that he believed he had done the right thing. She could not undermine the sacrifice he had just made by stepping into that shower with him.</p><p>She dragged herself out of the warm bed and to her own room. Knowing that she would get no more sleep that morning, she showered as well and tried not to think about how difficult it would be to get through the day ahead.</p><p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p> <p>Getting through the day really was a lot harder than she had anticipated once she remembered her appointment with the lawyer that afternoon. She was so tempted to let it slide, especially after the wonderful weekend the Palmer family had just enjoyed, but she couldn\u2019t keep leaving things up in the air like this. The weekend and the incident between her and Bryce that morning had complicated matters, but it hadn\u2019t really changed the big picture. The marriage was over, and it had been over for a very long time. It was with a heavy heart that she kept her appointment after her morning lectures and started the divorce proceedings. Jason Goodson, her attorney, had been a bit dismayed to discover that despite Bryce\u2019s sizeable assets, Bronwyn wanted nothing from him other than continued child support and joint custody. Goodson had tried to dissuade her from this course of action, but she had remained firm in her decision until he\u2019d had no choice but to accept his client\u2019s wishes.</p><p>Getting through the rest of the afternoon was hell. Nothing seemed to go right, she couldn\u2019t concentrate enough to get any studying done, and the bookshop was even quieter than usual. It offered no distraction from her inner turmoil. To top off a truly miserable day, after she finished work she discovered that she had a flat tire on her brand-spanking-new car. To make matters even worse, her cell-phone battery had died and she didn\u2019t have her charger. Of all days to have given Paul the day off, this was the one time she could actually have used his help. Sobbing with frustration, she returned to the shop to call the Automobile Association and then waited nearly half an hour for them to arrive. Luckily, she had discovered the flat tire before leaving work and could safely wait for the AA inside the shop. By the time they had fixed the tire, she was nearly an hour late and the autumn sun had already disappeared behind the mountain. When she got home it was to find Bryce in the kitchen feeding a happily chattering Kayla. The toddler was intent on redistributing clumps of mashed potatoes from her bowl to her chubby fists and onto her hair. Bryce looked up when Bronwyn entered his field of vision, and his indulgent smile immediately faded.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell have you been?\u201d he asked in a controlled voice, his face dark with tightly leashed anger. \u201cI\u2019ve been going out of my mind with worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a flat tire,\u201d she explained tiredly, dropping her bag onto the kitchen table and sitting down next to Kayla, picking up a damp cloth to wipe the food from the little girl\u2019s face and hair. \u201cThe AA guys thought it may have been a slow puncture that I picked up on one of the gravel roads yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been sending message after message and getting zero response from you,\u201d he growled, still in that frighteningly controlled voice.</p> <p>\u201cWell, my battery died.\u201d She shrugged, doggedly wiping the smudges from Kayla\u2019s face despite the child\u2019s frantically shaking head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He swore, startling both her and Kayla, before handing the toddler\u2019s spoon to Bronwyn and stalking from the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cDaddy go \u2019way!\u201d Kayla informed redundantly, waving happily at the door through which her father had disappeared. Bronwyn sighed and dropped a kiss onto the child\u2019s silky curls, grimacing when her lips met a clump of cold food.</p><p>\u201cYou need a bath, little girl,\u201d she groaned, overcome with exhaustion at the mere thought of it, when all she wanted was to soak her own weary bones. \u201cWant a bubble bath with Mummy?\u201d</p><p>Kayla grinned and nodded happily, starting to sing a tuneless song occasionally peppered with words like \u201cmummy,\u201d \u201cbath,\u201d \u201chappy,\u201d \u201cbubbles,\u201d and \u201cplay\u201d; the rest was complete gibberish. Bronwyn laughed as she carried the child up to the master bath, wishing Bryce could hear the charming little ditty.</p><p>They were soon happily settled in the huge round tub and immersed in fragrant warm water. Kayla was on Bronwyn\u2019s lap and both of them were enjoying the massive amount of bubbles in the tub when Bryce walked in. He halted at the door, visibly surprised to see his wife and child sporting foam bubble caps and beards. Bronwyn yelped, feeling like an idiot for not locking the door, but she had been so preoccupied with Kayla that she hadn\u2019t even thought about it.</p> <p>\u201cDaddy,\u201d the child squealed, happy to see him as always. \u201cBaf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh . . . not right now, sweetheart.\u201d He shook his head regretfully, raising a wicked eyebrow at Bronwyn. \u201cAlthough I would love to.\u201d She rolled her eyes at the pathetic attempt at a leer and he chuckled. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSorry, Bron, I thought you were giving her a bath. I didn\u2019t know you were in the tub with her. I\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201d He turned to leave.</p><p>\u201cDaddy no go!\u201d Kayla demanded, fiercely unhappy that her father was about to leave. Bronwyn groaned and buried her face between the child\u2019s fragile shoulder blades, then looked up to meet his amused eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou might as well stay; she\u2019ll be insufferable if you don\u2019t,\u201d Bronwyn said. He nodded, lowering the lid on the commode and sitting down, leaning forward with his elbows resting on his denim-clad thighs and his hands loosely clasped between his knees. Happy that her daddy was watching, Kayla launched into full show-off mode. She decorated her mother\u2019s face and hair with more bubbles before dragging a plastic doll into the water and starting a chatty tea party with it. Soon she was totally absorbed in her game, and Bryce shifted his beautiful eyes from child to disconcerted mother.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to lose my temper earlier,\u201d he murmured.</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d She shrugged, shampooing Kayla\u2019s hair while the child continued to play. \u201cYou were worried. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was imagining all the worst scenarios,\u201d he admitted, lowering his eyes to his hands. \u201cI was on the verge of calling the police. I\u2019d already decided I would once I\u2019d finished feeding Kayla.\u201d Because his eyes weren\u2019t on her, she chose not to respond to that.</p><p>\u201cI regret this morning too,\u201d he said after a prolonged silence interrupted only by Kayla\u2019s happy chatter. This time he did raise his eyes to her face. He looked both uncomfortable and sincere.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said again. \u201cBut even though I couldn\u2019t really see it this morning, you did the right thing by leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt nearly killed me,\u201d he admitted gruffly.</p> <p>\u201cI know it wasn\u2019t easy.\u201d She nodded. \u201cBut thank you. I\u2019m sorry for pressuring you to stay. It would only have led to even bigger regrets.\u201d She grabbed the showerhead and started to rinse Kayla\u2019s hair. The child squirmed irritably when it interfered with her game.</p><p>\u201cKayla, sit still.\u201d Her mother\u2019s tone brooked no argument. Kayla stopped moving and sulkily leaned back against Bronwyn\u2019s chest. Bryce watched the two of them with a slightly dazed smile on his lips, and Bronwyn frowned, unable to interpret the expression on his face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re both so beautiful,\u201d he whispered, sounding awed and humbled. He looked so possessively proud that Bronwyn squirmed uncomfortably.</p><p>\u201cBryce.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t see her lips form his name. Instead he reached for a small towel and draped it over Kayla\u2019s hair, knotting it turban-style around her head. He reached for another, bigger towel and opened it up, patiently waiting for Bronwyn to finish soaping and rinsing their daughter before kneeling beside the tub to reach for the squirming toddler. His white T-shirt immediately got drenched when he wrapped the small child in the towel. He picked her up before nodding down at Bronwyn, who immediately sank down beneath the rapidly dissipating bubbles.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take it from here; you enjoy the rest of your bath,\u201d he urged, and she smiled gratefully, watching his tall, well-built form as he retreated from the bathroom.</p> <p>\u201cOh God,\u201d she moaned, burying her face in her wet hands. This was going to be so difficult. She straightened her narrow shoulders resolutely before finishing her bath and heading off to find her husband. He was in Kayla\u2019s room, reading the sleepy little girl a bedtime story. Bronwyn watched silently from the doorway, unseen by both father and daughter until eventually Kayla fell asleep. Bryce stopped reading and leaned down to drop a kiss on Kayla\u2019s baby-soft cheek.</p><p>\u201cGood night, angel,\u201d he murmured, so quietly Bronwyn nearly missed it. When he got up and turned around, he seemed unsurprised to find her standing in the doorway. She came forward and dropped her own good-night kiss on Kayla\u2019s cheek before straightening to meet his gaze unflinchingly.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk,\u201d she said, and he nodded. She led the way out of the room and downstairs to the living room. She couldn\u2019t do this in the conservatory, not where they had shared so many experiences, both good and bad. He headed straight to the drinks cabinet and poured two glasses of neat scotch, seeming to realize that they would need it. He handed her one of the heavy, crystal glasses and gestured toward two comfortable chairs.</p><p>\u201cShall we?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, sitting down opposite him and taking a nervous sip of the fiery liquid that swirled so prettily in the glass. She coughed and he grinned.</p><p>\u201cStill can\u2019t hold your liquor, I see,\u201d he teased.</p><p>\u201cBryce, I filed for a divorce today,\u201d she said very quickly. His grin faded, and he went as white as a sheet. His eyes dropped to his glass and he lifted it to his lips with a somewhat shaky hand before downing the contents in one gulp.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want nothing from you,\u201d she continued hastily when his eyes lifted to meet hers again. \u201cJust what we discussed before: child support and joint custody.\u201d He got up and headed back to the drinks cabinet. He refilled his glass, doubling the amount this time. When he sat back down, he said nothing, merely drank down half of the liquor with a slight shudder.</p><p>\u201cSay something,\u201d she urged.</p><p>\u201cNothing more to say.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cNothing more to do really, except sit here and get very, very drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBryce,\u201d she admonished, but he didn\u2019t see her lips form his name because he was up once again, refilling his glass. When he returned to his seat this time, he brought the decanter with him and held it up to her with a questioning tilt of his head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou want some?\u201d He invited, indicating toward her barely touched alcohol.</p><p>\u201cBryce we need to talk.\u201d</p><p>He laughed rudely, sounding anything but amused.</p><p>\u201cAbout what, goddamn it?\u201d His voice rose and she jumped in fright. \u201cYou always want to talk but nothing much ever gets said! You want a divorce, you want child support, and you want joint custody? Fine, they\u2019re yours. I\u2019ll throw in the house in Knysna and a few million too! How does that sound?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want those things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you don\u2019t,\u201d he sneered. \u201cYou\u2019re too good for my money, for my apologies, and for my love, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>That did it! Bronwyn jumped up and, before she really had time to think about her actions, tossed the rest of her drink into his sneering face. She waited for him to blink the stinging alcohol from his eyes before she laid into him.</p><p>\u201cWhat apologies? What love?\u201d She both signed and screamed at him. \u201cSo far I haven\u2019t heard a word of apology from you. Not for tossing me out or for misjudging me. And you haven\u2019t once, not once since our wedding, since before our wedding for that matter, told me that you love me! In fact you did the polar opposite of that; you told me that you married me out of duty, that you\u2019d never loved me. Are you telling me different now, Bryce? Make up your damned mind because I\u2019m getting sick of your multiple personality disorder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBronwyn . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo! You have the utter gall to tell me that nothing much ever gets said.\u201d She was still using hands and mouth to make it absolutely clear how she felt. She didn\u2019t want him to miss a single word. \u201cWell whose fault is that, Bryce? You\u2019ve never really opened up to me. Trying to learn anything at all about you is like extracting blood from a stone. I was happy with our marriage before I left, but after being on my own for two years and really thinking about it, I recognized how completely screwed up our relationship was. It was all give from me and nothing but take from you. You hide yourself so completely from me that I wonder if the man I fell in love with ever really existed. So, you\u2019re right, the time for talking is over. I\u2019ll stay in this house as per our agreement but this divorce will happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you suddenly so desperate for a divorce?\u201d he asked suspiciously. \u201cIs it that professor? Are you leaving me for him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I leave you when we\u2019re not even together?\u201d she asked in exasperation. She was frustrated that none of her words seemed to be sinking in \u201cAnd no, I don\u2019t want a divorce because of Raymond. I doubt I\u2019ll see him again outside of school. And just because you\u2019ve played away during this marriage doesn\u2019t mean that I will.\u201d He looked completely confounded by her words and signaled for her to repeat them, evidently thinking he\u2019d misread her words. When she repeated what she\u2019d said, his jaw dropped to his chest as he stared at her in obvious shock.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d he asked. He was still sitting down, insouciantly sipping at his scotch, even though the alcohol she had tossed on him had drenched his head and shoulders. Bronwyn was still standing and glowering down at him. \u201cI haven\u2019t \u2018played away\u2019 as you so eloquently put it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who told me that your sex life was \u2018just fine,\u2019 remember? What else was I supposed to gather from that statement?\u201d He choked on a sip of scotch and coughed for a few minutes before eventually blinking rapidly to clear his eyes and stare at her stupidly again.</p><p>\u201cBronwyn . . . I was in an accident. I spent six months convalescing, a year in therapy, and the rest of the time actively avoiding crowds. I went out only once, and that was to a surprise party for Theresa De Lucci just a couple of weeks before we found you again. When do you think I had time to shag other women?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou said . . .\u201d Okay, so maybe he\u2019d lied.</p><p>\u201cI was trying to save face. You were asking me about sex and all I could think about was getting you naked and beneath me again. Hardly something I wanted to advertise when I was still so angry with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the condoms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the pedestal drawer,\u201d she elaborated, and his lips twitched.</p><p>\u201cRick and Lisa have used that room in the past and while they did the responsible thing in purchasing condoms, they never really got around to using them, and she got pregnant faster than you could blink.\u201d He stared levelly up at her for a beat before grinning wickedly. \u201cWere you jealous, Bron?\u201d</p><p>Damn him!</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d She kept her face expressionless but couldn\u2019t quite hide the betraying flush from him. \u201cI just thought you were a hypocrite for getting weird about Raymond when you\u2019d all but admitted to sleeping with other women. It doesn\u2019t matter anymore anyway. The divorce still stands.\u201d Her words brought the reality of their situation back to him and he sobered immediately. \u201cI want to pick up the pieces of my life and move on. I just can\u2019t be happy living like this.\u201d</p> <p>He stood up, towering above her, and his eyes bored desperately into hers.</p><p>\u201cWe can be a family, Bronwyn,\u201d he urged, holding out an imploring hand. \u201cThis weekend proved that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, all this weekend proved is that you still have secrets that you refuse to share with me. And it will always be that way, won\u2019t it, Bryce? You will always close off some part of yourself from me. I\u2019ve never really known you and I doubt that I ever will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, please,\u201d he groaned. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that,\u201d she said. She just felt tired and defeated. He stood there, hand still outstretched and looking miserable, with alcohol dripping from his hair and into his eyes. For a very brief moment she felt herself softening.</p><p>\u201cI know that I\u2019ve been an utter bastard,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>His admission strengthened her resolve.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a question? Or an actual apology?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated briefly and she rolled her eyes. \u201cGet back to me when you know for sure.\u201d She swept from the room, and Bryce stared at the door for a long time after she\u2019d left.</p><p>Now that this whole divorce thing was becoming a palpable fact, he admitted to himself that he wasn\u2019t quite so willing to roll over and give her everything that she asked for. He wanted his wife and child but he was a broken man, both physically and emotionally, and it hardly seemed fair to saddle her with his innumerable problems after everything that he had already put her through. Yet he knew that without her he\u2019d go back to being the empty husk he\u2019d been after she\u2019d left. He sighed and corrected the thought, after he\u2019d driven her away. Two years ago he had been careless with the most precious thing in his world and had lost it as a result. He wished that there were some way to regain her trust and reconcile with her, but in his heart he didn\u2019t think he deserved that much anymore.</p><p>\u201cYou still with us, Bronwyn?\u201d Bronwyn blinked when a slender hand was waved in front of her face and she saw that the four other women sitting at the restaurant table were staring at her expectantly. They had been discussing Theresa\u2019s marriage renewal ceremony, which was coming up later in the year. The other women were excitedly exchanging ideas for the event.</p> <p>\u201cSorry, I missed that,\u201d she muttered, and Alice snorted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve missed large chunks of the conversation from what I could tell,\u201d the other woman said with raised eyebrows. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with you? You checked out of this conversation before it even started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m divorcing Bryce,\u201d Bronwyn told them after taking a fortifying sip of alcohol. It had been a difficult week. She and Bryce had barely spoken since Monday even though he had tried to approach her on numerous occasions. She\u2019d spent her time actively avoiding him and felt like a rank coward because of it.</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d Lisa looked stunned by the information, and the other women were all staring at her sympathetically.</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019ve spoken to a lawyer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought things were getting better.\u201d Lisa looked devastated by the information, and Bronwyn sighed quietly before shaking her head.</p> <p>\u201cNo, the plan has always been to get a divorce. We\u2019re living together because it\u2019s convenient right now and less stressful for Kayla, but as soon as I graduate and find a job I\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that will take years.\u201d Theresa unknowingly echoed the words Bronwyn had spoken to Bryce when he\u2019d first suggested his house-sharing idea to her.</p><p>\u201cYes and it does bother me. I really don\u2019t want to take advantage of Bryce\u2019s generosity . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh bullcrap,\u201d Theresa cut her off with what for her was uncharacteristically strong language. \u201cYou\u2019re the mother of his child and you spent the first year and a half of Kayla\u2019s life struggling to take care of her at the cost of your own health. So don\u2019t you dare feel bad about accepting the aid that you\u2019re entitled to receive from the father of your child. It\u2019s the very least he can do.\u201d The other women stared at Theresa in surprise, and she looked a little uncomfortable before shrugging. \u201cIt\u2019s something I feel strongly about.\u201d Bronwyn smiled before nodding her agreement.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, Theresa, but Bryce has suffered too. He missed the first year and a half of Kayla\u2019s life, and he had that accident while following me and we all know how that ended.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll things that could have been avoided if he\u2019d acted less like an arse after he discovered that you were pregnant,\u201d Lisa pointed out reasonably.</p><p>\u201cYes, what married man reacts like that to the news that he\u2019s going to be a father, anyway?\u201d Alice added her two cents worth. \u201cI like Bryce but seriously, that was a jerk move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that everything will seem a lot less complicated after a couple of drinks,\u201d Roberta Richmond, who had joined their group for the first time that night, suggested with a decisive nod. She wasn\u2019t quite up to speed on the Bronwyn and Bryce situation, but she showed her solidarity by ordering a round of drinks\u2014even though she kept herself restricted to nonalcoholic cocktails. The woman, at twenty-six, was a couple of years younger than Bronwyn and was a friend of Theresa\u2019s. Apparently they had met at some football thing that Sandro, Theresa\u2019s husband, attended regularly. The tomboyish young woman was now the only single, childless member of their group. Theresa had informed them before inviting Bobbi\u2014as she preferred to be called\u2014that the other woman had very few female friends. Bronwyn liked her positive energy. She was a good addition to their little group.</p> <p>They spent the rest of the day tossing back cocktails, and, in an effort to cheer her up, the other women started offering Bronwyn all kinds of increasingly bawdy advice on how she could bounce back from her divorce. One of them suggested Bronwyn hook up with a male stripper, which actually made very little sense, but they weren\u2019t very sensible by that point.</p><p>\u201cI guarantee a male stripper would know what to do between the sheets.\u201d Lisa nodded knowingly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPlease, like you\u2019d know,\u201d Theresa scoffed.</p><p>\u201cI heard they are mostly gay,\u201d Bronwyn ventured.</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d Alice looked disappointed by the very idea.</p><p>\u201cWe should do some research,\u201d Bobbi mused, licking the salt off her margarita glass. \u201cFind a stripper and ask him if he\u2019s gay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere are we going to find a stripper?\u201d Bronwyn asked, curious, more than a little tipsy.</p><p>\u201cI know a place,\u201d the very shy and straitlaced Theresa, of all people, volunteered.</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d Lisa gasped, scandalized. \u201cYou do not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Theresa maintained smugly. \u201cI saw a documentary about it last week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what are we waiting for then?\u201d Alice asked eagerly. \u201cLet\u2019s go find us some strippers!\u201d</p> <p>Bryce always positioned himself in a room that would get hit by any car headlights whenever he knew Bronwyn was going to be out late. That way he could be certain she was home safely before heading to bed. He would never be able to sleep if he knew she was still out. He always worried about whether she was safe when she was out late with her bunch of gal pals. Unfortunately the women were all quite adamant that security not be present at their gatherings, but the men had collectively agreed to always have at least one guy incognito and keeping an eye on them. Still, it didn\u2019t prevent Bryce from getting stressed out every time it got a little too close to midnight on these girlie Saturdays. Right now it was after midnight and the responses he\u2019d received to the frantic SMSes he\u2019d sent to both Rick and Pierre\u2014whose guy had security detail that night\u2014had been pretty similar: Chill out bro, they\u2019re fine and Relax! I\u2019ve checked. There\u2019s nothing to worry about. He supposed he would have to be content with that.</p><p>At long last, close to one in the morning, the headlights swept up the drive, and he leaped up from the sofa in the den and headed to the front door, fury mixed with the relief he felt.</p><p>Strangely enough the headlights were sweeping back down the drive just as he got to the front door, and he was still trying to figure out what that meant when the door swung open. His wife staggered, that was the only word he could think of to describe her movement, into the foyer. Her face lit up when she saw him, and he blinked in surprise until the fumes hit him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re drunk!\u201d he accused in disbelief. That explained the headlights; she had probably come home by taxi. She said something that he didn\u2019t quite catch, and he imagined that she was probably slurring her words. She held her hand up, thumb and forefinger an inch apart, and he shook his head. \u201cMore than a little, Bronwyn. Where the hell have you been?\u201d She winced and rubbed her ears and spoke again, and he caught enough of her words to comprehend that he\u2019d probably used a little too much volume on the question. He took a deep, calming breath like his speech therapist had taught him to and repeated the question in what he hoped was a quieter voice. It was always hard to judge when he was feeling this riled up.</p><p>\u201c. . . With girls.\u201d</p><p>He caught just the tail end of that, but it was enough.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been out with \u2018the girls\u2019 before but never till nearly one in the morning,\u201d he said, seething.</p><p>You\u2019re not my dad! she signed sloppily before trying to weave her way past him. She lacked the necessary coordination though and instead walked right into him. Bryce grabbed her upper arms and steadied her. She smiled blindingly up at him before quite unexpectedly running her hands over his bare forearms and then up over his biceps. He was so distracted by her touch that for a second he didn\u2019t know that she was speaking. Her eyes had glazed over with familiar desire, and she seemed to be talking more to herself than him. He tried to focus on her lips and not on his burgeoning erection, but it still took a few moments before any of what she was saying sank in.</p><p>\u201cStripper?\u201d Okay, this time he knew he was bellowing. \u201cWhat stripper?\u201d To his utter disappointment, she stopped her seductive stroking of his skin and frowned up at him. She lifted one of her hands from his arm and raised a forefinger to her lips in the universal shushing gesture.</p><p>\u201cWhat stripper?\u201d he asked again, in what he knew was a whisper, and she rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cMassive Marvin,\u201d she informed him helpfully, but then removed her other hand from his overheated skin to say the rest in clumsy sign language. But he\u2019s not that massive. You\u2019re much bigger than he is . . . She paused thoughtfully while she ran her eyes over his body and then switched back to words. \u201cMuch bigger, all over!\u201d Right. That last gesture was not exactly standard sign language but accompanied by the look she directed downward it was quite unmistakable and very flattering. He felt his face heating and his body hardening even more. He watched as her eyebrows sprang almost all the way to her hairline as she recognized what was happening to him. She raised her glassy eyes to his once more and licked her lips hungrily. God, he knew that look. She wanted him as much as he wanted her, but she was so drunk that he knew it would be wrong to act on their mutual need right then.</p><p>Sleeping with her while she was wasted was not part of his reconciliation plan. Okay, he still had no real idea what the hell his reconciliation plan was, but he was pretty sure that sleeping with her right now would not be the best first step.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gay,\u201d she said. Her lips formed the words clearly enough, and he frowned in confusion at the non sequitur.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked. She was so bloody enchanting like this, but at the same time utterly confounding.</p> <p>\u201cMassive Marvin. He\u2019s gay.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd that disappointed you?\u201d he asked levelly, trying not to sound jealous at the thought of his wife ogling some other guy. Of course, he had no idea if he succeeded or not, but he hoped that he managed to sound as neutral as he was pretending to be.</p><p>\u201cNo, it was more of a scientific experiment.\u201d Her eyes were on his lower lip, and he wondered what the hell she found so fascinating about it.</p><p>\u201cGoing to a strip club was a scientific experiment?\u201d He knew that he sounded like a complete idiot, but he wasn\u2019t sure he was following this weird conversation correctly. He kept feeling like he was missing something.</p><p>\u201cYou have such a gorgeous mouth.\u201d She totally threw him with that one. \u201cMuch better than Massive Marvin\u2019s.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you going to compare me to this Massive Marvin guy all night?\u201d he asked resentfully, feeling ridiculous even saying the stupid name.</p><p>\u201cNo . . . not fair, he\u2019d lose.\u201d She went up on her toes and completely slammed him by kissing him. Her arms crept around his neck, and her body was flush against his. He could feel every single curve of her body through their clothes. His arms went around her waist and his hands cupped her firm butt and lifted her until he could feel her feminine heat against his aching hardness. God, it felt amazing having her in his arms again. It would be so easy to strip her naked, push her up against the wall, and . . .</p><p>Whoa there, buddy! He lifted his head and his hands, raising them up with his palms out in a gesture of surrender, and wondered, with the slightest hint of hysteria, why he was always the one calling a halt to things. One day he was going to give her what she so desperately wanted and to hell with the consequences. But, he conceded wryly as he looked down into her frustrated face, that day was not today. She was weaving on the spot and if not for the fact that she still had her arms tightly wrapped around his neck, she would probably have fallen.</p><p>\u201cBabe, you can\u2019t keep torturing me like this,\u201d he could feel the hoarseness in his throat and wondered if he\u2019d managed to get the words out loudly enough for her to hear. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s get you to bed.\u201d Her expression brightened at the word \u201cbed,\u201d and Bryce rolled his eyes, dragging her arms away from his neck and assisting her up to her room. After another frustrating battle in her bedroom, where she seemed to have grown at least six extra arms and put them to good use, he thankfully managed to get her into bed.</p><p>He stared grimly down at his passed-out wife, his body hard, aching, and heavy with suppressed lust. He couldn\u2019t live like this anymore; it was enough to test a saint, and he was no bloody saint. He shook his head in disgust before heading for his usual cold shower.</p> <p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p><p>When Bronwyn joined them in the sunny kitchen for breakfast the following morning, she was wearing a gigantic pair of sunglasses and moving gingerly, with the caution of someone nursing a hell of a headache. She was dressed in a faded shirt and an ugly pair of sweat pants that had seen better days. Her hair was a complete mess. She tried to swallow down her nausea when Bryce gestured toward a pile of pancakes with a raised eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cCoffee,\u201d she grunted as she sat down carefully in the chair immediately to Bryce\u2019s right. His lips twitched as he poured some of the hot, dark brew into a mug and placed it on the table in front of her. Kayla was staring at her mother curiously.</p><p>\u201cMummy sick?\u201d she asked worriedly, and Bronwyn shook her head before wincing as the movement set off the annoying little drummer gremlins that seemed to have taken up residence in her brain.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay, sweetie.\u201d Her voice was hoarse and she cleared her throat self-consciously before smiling reassuringly at her little girl. Satisfied with her answer, Kayla went back to playing with her food and singing her off-key little ditty.</p><p>Bronwyn flinched at the noise before daring to glance up at Bryce, who was still watching her quietly. She remembered embarrassing bits and pieces of what had happened after she had returned home the night before and didn\u2019t quite know what to say to him this morning.</p> <p>\u201cYou know, Bron,\u201d he said, breaking the awkward silence between them, and she looked up a little too quickly at the sound of his voice. She bit back a groan and looked at him fully, bracing herself for his censure.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she prompted when he remained silent a little too long.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all for it if you want to use me for . . .\u201d He glanced over at Kayla before lowering his voice. \u201cS-e-x, as long as we come to some sort mutual of agreement over it. No more of this coming-on-to-me-in-a-moment-of-weakness crap. At least that way we both know exactly where we stand, and I won\u2019t feel like an utter bastard when I act on these mixed signals that you\u2019re sending.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so . . .\u201d</p><p>He made a rude sound, cutting off her apology.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Just don\u2019t apologize. I don\u2019t think I can handle it right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBryce, I think that I should move out. Not far from here, close enough for you to have access to Kayla. You\u2019ll still have her when I\u2019m at school of course, and she could have a sleepover here at least once a week. I\u2019ve been thinking about it . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cClearly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201c. . . and it\u2019s a workable solution,\u201d she continued, ignoring his sarcastic little interruption. \u201cOne that would suit our lifestyles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how can you afford a place of your own on the salary you\u2019re earning?\u201d He looked shell-shocked by her words, but Bronwyn refused to allow her resolve to weaken. Theresa\u2019s vehement words the night before had made her think that maybe she did deserve something more than this warped arrangement that he had suggested. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ll have to pay for it,\u201d she told him resolutely, and his eyes narrowed. \u201cYou will pay for my new place, my studies, and child support. I think that it\u2019s the least you can do. I don\u2019t want hundreds of thousands or half of your company or any other kind of payday, but it would be stupid of me not to ask for your support until after I\u2019ve finished my studies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to move out,\u201d he said grimly.</p><p>\u201cI know, but if I don\u2019t move out, we\u2019ll keep repeating the same cycle. I don\u2019t want to want you, Bryce. But I do, and if I stay here we will wind up in bed together again and that\u2019ll be a huge step backward for us. For me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBronwyn, what will it take to convince you that I don\u2019t want to lose you, or Kayla? That I honestly want to save our marriage?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBryce, there\u2019s nothing left to save,\u201d she said with a bitter smile. \u201cYes, I\u2019m physically attracted to you, but we can\u2019t base a marriage on that alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all you feel for me? Physical attraction?\u201d he asked hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she lied, happy that the sunglasses hid her eyes from him.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Kayla?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cKayla will be fine; we\u2019ll all be fine, Bryce.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBronwyn.\u201d His voice dropped to an urgent whisper, rife with despair. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t do this. Give us a chance. I know that I\u2019ve done horrible things and behaved reprehensibly, but . . .\u201d She held up her hands, hating to see him beg and knowing that if she allowed it to continue, she would cave.</p><p>\u201cBryce, you\u2019ve hurt me and I\u2019m finding it . . . a little difficult to move on from that.\u201d She removed her sunglasses, grimacing a bit as the bright light burned into her retinas, but she wanted him to see the truth in her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m trying to forgive you, but I\u2019m only human, and the mistakes you made were enormous. Try seeing it from my point of view. Try to imagine how it felt to be so completely rejected for getting pregnant. Imagine how lost I felt when you didn\u2019t call, when you refused to take my calls, when you seemed to reject me at every turn.\u201d He opened his mouth to say something but after a quick, painful breath closed it again, and he allowed her to speak. \u201cYou\u2019ve made some cruel comments about the clothes and toys Kayla had when you found us again. But every single cent I made went into keeping her clean, clothed, fed, happy, and healthy. It was a huge responsibility that I had to bear by myself. You weren\u2019t there, Bryce. It was just me and I had to make the best I could of our situation.</p><p>\u201cAnd then, when you found us again, you behaved like you were the wronged one! Your deafness was somehow my fault and I had \u2018abandoned\u2019 you at the scene of an accident.\u201d She could hear the stark bitterness in her own voice and knew that it had to be visible in her eyes and on her face. She was still so very furious at the unjustness of those particular indictments. \u201cDo you not see how unforgivable those accusations were? How insurmountable these problems are? And now you want us to be a family, you don\u2019t want a divorce, and you expect me to somehow be grateful for that? You expect me to forget all the pain you\u2019ve inflicted? Well, I can\u2019t do it, Bryce. I wish I could, but since I have no idea what set you off in the first place, how on earth am I supposed to trust you not to go off the deep end again? What if I inadvertently trigger your rejection button again? I can\u2019t live with the uncertainty. I don\u2019t want to and I refuse to allow my daughter to experience the same pain and confusion.</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019ve said it before, but I\u2019m also heartily sick of your secretiveness, Bryce. This situation has made me recognize how much you\u2019ve kept from me. You\u2019re completely closed off and that\u2019s not something that\u2019s only recently developed. I\u2019ve come to discover that you\u2019ve always kept things from me and I don\u2019t even care what those secrets are anymore.\u201d</p><p>It was a long speech and it had been difficult to maintain her focus and keep facing him so that he could catch all of it. She had tried to intersperse it with as much sign language as she could, but she still couldn\u2019t be sure that he had caught all of it. The hangover headache had quite happily invited a tension headache to join the wild party in her brain, and the pain was becoming almost unbearable.</p><p>\u201cI was trying to protect you,\u201d he confessed after a long silence, and Bronwyn cast an eye over to her daughter, who was starting to watch her parents with a worried frown, not as oblivious to the tension as they had hoped. Bronwyn cast a reassuring smile at Kayla. Not quite sure what to make of that last statement.</p> <p>\u201cYou and the baby,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProtect us from what, Bryce?\u201d she asked, combining the spoken words with broken sign language to convey her frustration. Every little bit that he so begrudgingly revealed made her recognize how very much he was still keeping hidden from her. She\u2019d seen only the very tip of this iceberg, and she was astounded by her own former ignorance. How had she never recognized the magnitude of this problem? She had been so blinded by her love and happiness that she\u2019d never known what an unhappy and troubled man her husband was. She had been so na\u00efve and stupid.</p><p>\u201cFrom what?\u201d she asked again, and he shook his head helplessly. \u201cWhy did you react that way to the news of my pregnancy?\u201d</p><p>He sighed deeply and the sound seemed torn from the depths of his chest. His eyes were stark with unhappiness and fear. He shook his head again before pushing himself up and dropping a kiss on top Kayla\u2019s head. The little girl managed to smear some scrambled eggs across his cheek but he didn\u2019t seem to notice as he straightened up to look at Bronwyn again. The naked vulnerability on his face tore at her heart and she bit the inside of her cheek to prevent herself from blurting out something stupid. Something like she loved him or that she would stay. She felt like she would do anything to wipe that look of utter isolation and agony from his eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll get my assistant to look into viable homes for you. Once we\u2019ve compiled a list of possibilities, you can decide which one suits you best.\u201d He turned and walked out of the room, leaving Bronwyn feeling wrung out and deflated by the hollow victory.</p><p>Bryce waited until he was safely back behind the closed door of his study before bending at the waist and inhaling deeply as the consequences of his promise hit him like a freight train. She was going to leave him and he was going to let her because she deserved her freedom, because it was cruel to saddle a vibrant and affectionate woman like her with an emotionally crippled husband, and most importantly because he still didn\u2019t know how to explain his actions on that long-ago night.</p><p>A baby, Jesus God, he had thought. He wasn\u2019t ready to be a father! He would be terrible at it. He would be like his own father\u2014abusive, mean, and absent in both heart and soul. He couldn\u2019t have a child yet, not until Bronwyn healed him some more. Over the last couple of years, she had been a balm to his restless and damaged spirit. In time, her gentle calm and kindness would have spread to him, would have seeped into his soul and made him the kind of man that he longed to be. He would have been ready to be a father then and responsible for a brand-new life. And yet she was pregnant now . . . she had his baby inside of her at this very moment. His breath hitched on a sob as he saw her in his mind\u2019s eye, getting rounder, softer, her breasts growing full and heavy with milk. He saw her giving birth, saw their baby: angry, red, naked, and crying and loved it with all his heart. He wanted that life with his entire being.</p><p>Not just the two of them but the three of them: A family.</p> <p>Yes, he wanted that life badly, and with Bronwyn by his side, he was almost certain that he could have it. He wasn\u2019t his father. He had practically raised Rick without harming a hair on his head, so why would he be any different with his own children? God, Bron probably hated him so much right now, but he would try to explain it to her. Maybe he could finally tell her about his father and she would understand. She wouldn\u2019t think he was a monster just because one had sired him. She would forgive him. She had to. Surely she loved him enough to forgive him?</p><p>He was already back on his feet and ready to go talk to her when he heard the engine of her BMW roar to life, followed by the unmistakable sound of tires squealing in the driveway. His stomach clenched and his heart just about stopped.</p><p>\u201cNo . . . nononononono . . .\u201d The litany sounded like a prayer as he lurched from the room. He heard a screech as she battled with the clutch and then the throaty purr as the car obeyed her commands and sprang to life. He was just out of the front door when the car went hurtling out of the driveway. \u201cGod, please . . .\u201d he begged as he turned back and palmed his own set of keys from the table in the hall before diving for the Maserati that he had left parked in the front. She wasn\u2019t a good driver, and she usually battled with the curves on the steep, winding road. He followed her at a distance, careful not to spook her; he could see her taillights a few bends down and knew he would be able to catch up to her in his faster car. He only prayed that she didn\u2019t misjudge a curve and get hurt. God, he would die if she were injured or if the baby got hurt. She would never forgive him if anything happened to the baby, would never believe that he wanted it as much as she did but had just been too damned cowardly to admit it. He wanted them safe. He wanted them with him. He would give anything in the world to take back the last half an hour. He was petrified that when he managed to catch up with her, she wouldn\u2019t want him anymore, wouldn\u2019t love him anymore!</p><p>He couldn\u2019t live without her love. All that stupid overwhelming tenderness he had told himself he felt for her, how the hell had he not recognized it for what it was? The road was leveling out when it happened\u2014a young couple, hand in hand, stepped into his path. They were so absorbed in each other that they didn\u2019t see him coming. He swerved to avoid them and went off the road. He had just enough time to feel gratitude that he had left the steep curves behind him before the car flipped and rolled several times. He was briefly aware of feeling excruciating pain everywhere, and his last thoughts before he passed out were regret that he might never see his baby and absolute terror that he might never hold Bronwyn again.</p><p>When next he opened his eyes, it was to profound silence. He gradually came to understand that he was hanging upside down and held suspended by his seat belt. He blinked at the gathering crowd outside the car and the first face he saw clearly was hers. He smiled, relieved that she had come back but puzzled by the complete lack of emotion on her face.</p> <p>\u201cBronwyn.\u201d He felt his lips form the word but couldn\u2019t hear it. It was incredibly quiet; he hadn\u2019t expected an accident scene to be this deathly silent. He tried again, called her name, and felt his throat tighten and hoarsen as he kept calling and calling without once uttering a sound. She didn\u2019t move, she merely watched him, and he went cold with dread. She hated him.</p><p>God, he had known that she would eventually hate him . . . he had always known it. He had spent the past two years waiting for her to fall out of love with him. He wasn\u2019t good enough for her love. Some part of him had always known that the son of a monster didn\u2019t deserve such a glorious creature\u2019s love.</p><p>Still, he begged and pleaded with her to come to him. God, she was so lovely, he adored her in that dress, he always had. But she had ignored him. She had turned around, walked away, and left him in pain and in silence.</p><p>Five days after Bronwyn\u2019s devastating announcement, Kayla was sitting in a patch of late autumn sunshine in the conservatory with her daddy and happily playing house with her dolls and tea sets. She was dressed in a pink princess costume and those ubiquitous red sneakers that she so loved. Bryce had brought his laptop upstairs and was sitting on the heated tile floor next to her, enjoying the sunshine as he read and replied to his most urgent e-mails. He stopped occasionally to take a sip of imaginary tea from a dainty plastic cup, smacking his lips every time, which inevitably sent his daughter into paroxysms of giggles. He loved watching her laugh. She looked exactly like her mother when she laughed so unreservedly. Bronwyn used to laugh like that; she\u2019d put her entire body into it as the laughter worked its way out from her belly. He couldn\u2019t remember the last time she had laughed like that and felt a pang of regret at the loss. It had always been such a joy to see and hear her laughing, and he often wondered if Kayla\u2019s laughter sounded anything like her mother\u2019s. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He watched Kayla play and contemplated his previous fears that he would hurt her the way his father had hurt him. The thought of anybody, including himself, harming her in any way was repellent and raised every protective instinct he had. Something that had once seemed so inevitable had become a complete nonevent. He hadn\u2019t expected to trust himself around her, had thought that he would need constant supervision, someone to keep an eye on him and make sure he didn\u2019t hurt her. But from the moment he had first laid eyes on her all he had wanted was to spend time with her, get to know her, spoil her, and love her.</p><p>She amused him, baffled him at times, and even angered him on the odd occasion, but the only time he had physically hurt her had been by accident. It was an incident that still weighed heavily on his mind because of his reprehensible behavior toward Bronwyn afterward. He sighed heavily. Kayla toddled over to wrap her arms around his throat and plant a moist kiss on his cheek.</p><p>\u201cDaddy sad.\u201d She had learned to speak to him only when he was facing her, and he saw her sweet words clearly.</p><p>\u201cNo, baby, I\u2019m happy to be with you,\u201d he reassured her, and she smiled brightly.</p> <p>Love Daddy, she signed clumsily, and his heart simply melted. He kept it together as he signed I love you back at her. That satisfied her, and she went back to her dolls. Bryce swallowed the lump in his throat and blinked the scorching moisture from his eyes. It had been two weeks since Bronwyn had told him that she wanted to move out, and tomorrow he would be taking her to look at the flats that he had personally selected. The divorce papers had been delivered earlier in the week, and he had shoved them into one of his desk drawers rather than put his signature on them. He knew that he was running from the inevitable, but he felt such an overwhelming sense of panic every time he thought about those papers that he often found himself on the verge of hyperventilating. He could feel the panic rising even now and set aside his laptop to focus on Kayla, hoping to tamp down the anxiety.</p><p>Bronwyn walked into the conservatory, where Celeste had told her she would find Kayla and Bryce and froze in surprise at the sight that met her eyes when she entered the room. Bryce was sitting quietly while Kayla bustled around him, draping him in material. Bronwyn recognized the burnt orange throw from the sofa, the shell pink pashmina that she had left on one of the chairs the night before, a couple of bright-red curtain cords, and a couple of frilly doilies that Bronwyn had stowed away ages ago. The pashmina was draped over his shoulders, the throw over his lap, the doilies adorned his shoulders, and the cords were decorating his wrists like bracelets. Kayla took a step back and tilted her head contemplatively before nodding. She reached for her shiny plastic tiara and with the matching clip-on earrings and placed them on his head and ears.</p><p>\u201cHow do I look?\u201d she heard Bryce rumble from beneath the elaborate draping, and for a moment Bronwyn thought the question was aimed at her before she realized that he hadn\u2019t seen her yet. It was Kayla\u2019s opinion that he sought.</p><p>\u201cPwetty,\u201d the little girl replied, her curls bouncing with her assertive nod.</p><p>\u201cSo, can I have some tea now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course.\u201d The little girl sounded so adult that Bronwyn bit back a giggle, unutterably charmed by the scene in front of her. She proceeded to pour her imaginary tea into a plastic cup and balanced it on a matching saucer before handing it to her father. She followed it up with a bigger plate of very real biscuits. Bryce made appreciative sounds as he munched and \u201csipped\u201d and Kayla imitated him, chatting in her mostly unintelligible language all the while.</p><p>Bronwyn stepped farther into the room, startling both of them simultaneously. Kayla hurled herself at her mother for a hug, and Bryce tugged at one of the clip-on earrings in embarrassment, going bright red at being caught playing dress-up. He gave up with a sheepish shrug when he saw Bronwyn\u2019s amused smile, and a reluctant grin tugged at his lips.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re early,\u201d he pointed out, and Bronwyn jiggled Kayla on her hip, bussing the little girl\u2019s cheek before responding.</p><p>\u201cWe had some plumbing issues and had to close shop early. It may take a few days to sort out. So I may not be working on Monday either if they don\u2019t fix the problem over the weekend.\u201d She kicked off her shoes and let Kayla down when the little girl wriggled impatiently. Bronwyn sank down on the floor beside Bryce while Kayla fixed the earring he had tried to remove earlier.</p><p>\u201cDaddy pwetty,\u201d Kayla announced proudly as she tugged a doily back in place on one of her father\u2019s broad shoulders before dropping down into his lap and resting her head on the same shoulder she had just redecorated. Her thumb immediately went into her mouth.</p><p>\u201cVery pretty,\u201d Bronwyn agreed with a smirk, and Bryce rolled his eyes.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re princesses,\u201d he explained, and she laughed.</p><p>\u201cVery fetching,\u201d she complimented. Kayla repeated the word \u201cfetching\u201d around her thumb before pointing to the plate of biscuits with her free hand. Bryce reached for the plate and held it up to Bronwyn, who picked up a chocolate chip biscuit with a smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love some tea,\u201d Bronwyn prompted, and when Kayla lifted her head to give him a pointed look, he sighed and \u201cpoured\u201d a cup of tea. The cup looked ridiculously tiny in his hand as he daintily held it up.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Bronwyn nodded politely as she accepted the offering. \u201cSo this is what you do every day?\u201d</p><p>He snorted and nodded toward the closed laptop on the floor beside him.</p><p>\u201cI was trying to get some work done, but this was just so much more diverting,\u201d he confessed with a charming grin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou were always so easily distracted from work,\u201d she reminisced. \u201cLike the time you flew me to Mauritius for a long weekend, completely forgetting about that important conference call you had on the Monday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no regrets.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cThat was a hell of a weekend.\u201d They had spent most of it naked on a private beach.</p><p>\u201cPierre was furious with you,\u201d she recalled.</p><p>\u201cHe got over it. Besides, we were newlyweds, he understood.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019d been married for more than a year,\u201d she corrected.</p><p>\u201cYour point being?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember that street performer who followed us from the marketplace back to the hotel?\u201d she asked, and his eyes lit up with laughter at the memory.</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t stop his horrendous serenading the entire walk back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou begged him to stop, bribed him, and offered to put his unborn children through university,\u201d she said, giggling.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he understood my high-school French,\u201d Bryce laughed.</p><p>\u201cHe was awful!\u201d they both said in unison before lapsing into an awkward silence.</p><p>\u201cWe had some good times, didn\u2019t we?\u201d he asked after a few minutes.</p><p>\u201cThe best times,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBryce.\u201d She stopped what he\u2019d been about to say with a slight shake of her head, and his voice faded. He cleared his throat, shifting the weight of his now-dozing daughter until she rested more comfortably against his chest.</p> <p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re free tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>She nodded in answer to his question.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve selected a few flats for you to view tomorrow. I\u2019ll shift the appointments to the morning, so you can have the afternoon free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d There was really nothing more to be said after that.</p><p>Of course, each place he drove her to was more extravagant than the next. Accommodation in Camps Bay didn\u2019t come cheaply, and judging by the sizes of the so-called townhouses he took her to, none of the places would range anywhere under eight figures. Since they were remaining in the area, he\u2019d told Cal that he wouldn\u2019t be needed, and for the first time the family found themselves completely alone. It was an almost novel sensation for Bronwyn, who had gotten so used to the silent, hovering presence of the security guys that she felt inordinately exposed without them at first. But she soon got caught up in the whole flat-hunting experience</p><p>\u201cBryce,\u201d she finally spoke up when she found herself standing in the living room of the third mini mansion he had taken her to. \u201cThese places are all much too big.\u201d</p><p>He frowned at that and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI chose them because they all have both ocean and mountain views,\u201d he explained quietly. \u201cI know how much you love both. And this one has a patio and garden. You enjoy gardening. You haven\u2019t had much time for it recently, but at least you\u2019ll have the option. The next place on the list has a garden and a secure playground for Kayla. The pool is fenced in and there is ample room for a pet if you ever decide to get that dog you\u2019ve always wanted.\u201d She hadn\u2019t known that he had personally researched every place that he was showing her. She had assumed that he would pass the task off onto his assistant, but the level of care and consideration he\u2019d put into this task, despite his clear reluctance to have them move out, was touching. She didn\u2019t know what to say and swallowed heavily before turning away to shakily caution Kayla not to run too fast as the little girl careened from empty room to room.</p> <p>\u201cThe master bedroom will get the sunrise in the morning,\u201d he continued after clearing his throat awkwardly. \u201cAnd the living room gets the sunset. I thought you\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to go to so much trouble, Bryce. I know that you don\u2019t want us to leave. I didn\u2019t expect you to put so much work into this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you really have to leave me again, Bron, I want to know that you\u2019re safe, happy, and well taken care of. This is the only way I know to ensure that.\u201d She bit her lip uncertainly and he rewarded her with a grim smile before showing her the rest of the spectacular flat. By the time twelve o\u2019clock rolled by, he\u2019d shown her seven places, each one less than five minutes\u2019 drive away from his house. He clearly meant to keep them close by.</p><p>\u201cI chose this one because I thought you\u2019d like this,\u201d he told her as he led her to the second floor of the last place. It was an enormous duplex with panoramic views, a garden, a huge kitchen, four rooms, three and a half bathrooms, and a second-floor balcony that opened up from the main bedroom and overlooked the ocean.</p><p>He opened a door on the second floor and stood aside to let her enter, and Bronwyn\u2019s breath was sucked out of her body at the emotional sucker punch he\u2019d just dealt her. It was a small, beautiful conservatory. Two walls and half of the ceiling were made entirely of glass, one side facing the ocean and the other the mountain. It was absolutely beautiful. Her eyes flooded with tears as she realized that Bryce had chosen this place because he knew how much she would miss their conservatory when she moved out of the house.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d he asked, standing behind her as she automatically walked toward the window overlooking the aquamarine ocean.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d she whispered hoarsely, blinking back tears, before realizing that he couldn\u2019t see her lips. She nodded, keeping her back to him.</p><p>\u201cI knew you would.\u201d His voice sounded empty and she turned to see him reach for his cell phone and tap out a message to someone. Once he\u2019d completed it, he looked up at her with shadowed eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve contacted the estate agent to let her know that I\u2019ll be making an offer on this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has a garden, views, a fully equipped kitchen, a fenced-in pool, it\u2019s close to the stores and schools, and of course you\u2019ll have your own security detail. It also has this . . .\u201d He indicated one of the floor-to-ceiling glass walls. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect for you.\u201d</p><p>She nodded miserably, watching Kayla tug at her father\u2019s trouser leg as she tried to show him something that she had spotted through the window. Bryce looked down at his daughter before dutifully following her as she tugged him toward whatever had caught her attention. Bronwyn furtively swiped at a few errant tears and moved over to join them at the window. Her heart, already irretrievably broken, had just crumbled into a million tiny shards and the sharp little fragments were tearing her apart.</p> <p>\u201cReady to go?\u201d he asked after a few minutes of fawning over Kayla, and she nodded when he looked up at her. He hoisted Kayla up onto his hip and rested his free hand in the small of Bronwyn\u2019s back as he guided her ahead of him.</p><p>She expected him to drive them directly back to the house but instead he detoured down to the beachside restaurants that dotted the Camps Bay coastline, stopping outside one of the smaller places. Bronwyn gasped when she recognized it and her eyes flew to his profile. Why was he bringing her here?</p><p>\u201cI thought we could grab some lunch,\u201d he explained, throwing her an enigmatic look before unbuckling his seat belt and climbing out of the safe-as-houses Audi that he now preferred driving.</p><p>He rounded the bonnet of the car and held the passenger door open for her. She unbuckled her own belt and reluctantly got out of the car. He had Kayla out of her car seat before Bronwyn could react, and he once again placed his hand in the small of her back in order to gently steer her toward the familiar restaurant.</p><p>\u201cBryce.\u201d She resisted and looked up at him with pleading eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t want to eat here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve already made a reservation and every other place will be packed at lunchtime on a Saturday. Besides, Kayla will get cranky if she doesn\u2019t get her lunch soon.\u201d Bronwyn cast a skeptical eye over her brightly smiling daughter, who was happily hugging Broccoli, her well-worn green-haired little ragdoll.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry, Kayla?\u201d he asked, and Kayla nodded sunnily.</p><p>\u201cHungwy,\u201d she replied, and Bronwyn, realizing that she was outnumbered, bit back any further protests and reluctantly entered the restaurant where she had first laid eyes on him so long ago.</p><p>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p><p>The restaurant was the same as she remembered it. Of course, the staff was different but the menu and d\u00e9cor\u2014but for a few small changes here and there\u2014transported her back to a less complicated time. Bryce whispered something into their server\u2019s ear and sure enough, they were led to the same table that he had been seated at on that first day. A high chair was promptly provided for Kayla, and after taking their drink orders, the server bustled off and left them to stare silently at each other. Kayla was excited by the new surroundings and picked up her toy cell phone to tell her cousin \u201cWees\u201d about it.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you bring us here?\u201d Bronwyn broke the silence with a defeated little sigh, and he shrugged.</p> <p>\u201cI was feeling nostalgic.\u201d No. This had definitely been a deliberate decision that had very little to do with nostalgia. When he had agreed to her moving out, she had thought that he was beginning to accept her decision to get a divorce. This move, however, seemed to be the opening salvo of a counterattack.</p><p>The server returned with their drinks and for their meal orders. Neither of them had even glanced at the menu, but Bronwyn knew it by heart and ordered steamed chicken and vegetables for Kayla and chicken Marsala with mashed potatoes for herself. Bryce kept his eyes pinned to hers as he directed his order to the hovering server.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have the milkshake. Chocolate. And the Brie and bacon burger.\u201d The young man, clearly a much better server than she had ever been, reconfirmed their orders before leaving.</p><p>\u201cBryce, I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re hoping to achieve here but . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were standing over at that table when I first saw you.\u201d He pointed toward a nearby table and she blinked over at it. \u201cYou had this look of utter panic on your face. I\u2019d been to this restaurant several times before and knew that if you were serving at that table, then you were probably working this whole section. That\u2019s why I requested this table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou requested this table?\u201d She gaped at him in disbelief, absently picking up Kayla\u2019s bright-pink toy phone when she dropped it on the table and handing it back to her so that she could continue her make-believe conversation. Bronwyn had always assumed that he\u2019d been placed at one of her tables by chance.</p><p>\u201cI did. I noticed you almost immediately and then simply couldn\u2019t look away.\u201d Yes, she remembered that disturbingly intense stare. She\u2019d been even more of a klutz as a result of it. \u201cI was riveted, charmed, confused, and fascinated. Unequivocally and helplessly fascinated.\u201d He gazed off into the distance, lost in his memories. The harsh lines of his face had softened, and a sweet, wistful smile flirted with the corners of his lips.</p><p>\u201cI barely heard a word Pierre said and categorically dominated your time by calling you over for the smallest little thing,\u201d he recalled.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mind,\u201d she confessed, allowing the sweetness of the memory to claim her as well. \u201cI was equally fascinated. I barely remembered that poor Pierre was there half of the time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou were the most entrancing thing I\u2019d ever seen,\u201d he said, his voice gruff, and she shook her head dismissively.</p><p>\u201cHardly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still are, Bronwyn.\u201d He brushed aside her automatic protest. \u201cYou\u2019re not some boring, conventional beauty, true. And yeah, you tend to be a little clumsy at times. But you\u2019re unusual, interesting, and to me you\u2019re just so indescribably gorgeous. I never thought that I deserved you. You were too good for the likes of me.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t understand that sentiment at all. He was heartbreakingly handsome and she was painfully plain. He came from a background of wealth and privilege while her family had been as poor as church mice. He had been Oxford educated with a master\u2019s degree in business while she had barely made it through high school. It had been a classic Cinderella tale, and Bronwyn had been the one to feel inadequate when compared to him.</p> <p>\u201cI should have left you alone,\u201d he was saying, his low voice alive with misery and his eyes filled with such profound sadness that Bronwyn felt her eyes tearing up in response. \u201cI tried to leave you alone after that day, but I just couldn\u2019t stay away from you. I had to see you again. You were so sweet and gentle and every time I was with you . . . I felt . . .\u201d His voice had gone so quiet that she could barely hear him, and the last word was almost silent, but she could have sworn he said cleansed. He\u2019d felt cleansed when he was with her? It was such an odd choice of words that she knew she must have been mistaken, but what else could it have been?</p><p>His voice had faded away completely now and he wasn\u2019t speaking anymore, merely staring down at the place setting in front of him. His large hands were curled into fists on the tabletop, and Bronwyn reached over to cover them with her own hands. The gesture brought his eyes back up to hers and she was startled see moisture sparkling in them.</p><p>\u201cI should have stayed away from you,\u201d he repeated. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t. I can\u2019t. You\u2019re my light, Bronwyn. You\u2019re my love. I\u2019m so lost without you. I\u2019ve always been so lost without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBryce.\u201d</p><p>He shook himself and glanced over at their perceptive daughter, who had stopped playing and was watching them with wide and worried eyes. She looked on the verge of tears.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have started this conversation with Kayla around.\u201d He forced a smile for the little girl\u2019s sake and dragged his hands out from under hers. She watched as he brusquely wiped at his eyes and put on a cheerful front for their daughter.</p><p>She kept stealing glances at him, wondering at the unfamiliar man that he\u2019d allowed her to catch a glimpse of today. That was what she had wanted\u2014demanded\u2014from him. Honesty. And he had just given her a huge chunk of honesty. But whatever his truth was, she now knew that it was devastating, and she was certain that whatever it was had been responsible for his painful reaction to her pregnancy. Some truly awful thoughts were starting to form in the back of her mind, but her suspicions were so ugly that she forced them back down and dismissed them as impossible.</p><p>She watched as he gently teased and played with their daughter and forced herself to remember the day that she\u2019d told him about her pregnancy. He had reacted in a near-violent explosion of emotions, accusations, and . . . fear. She recalled the look in his eyes and now understood that he had been absolutely terrified by her news. She was completely staggered by this unexpected new insight into the confusing events of that night.</p><p>\u201cProtect us from what?\u201d she asked, but he was playing with Kayla and didn\u2019t see her question. She waved her hand to get his attention, and he blinked up at her, his too-long hair flopping over one eye in the process. That errant lock of hair made him look so boyish and vulnerable that she felt a lump forming in her throat. She unthinkingly reached over and brushed the hair out of his eyes with gentle fingers. He leaned into her touch, but she withdrew her hand almost immediately.</p><p>\u201cA couple of weeks ago you said that you wanted to protect us from something.\u201d She went back to what was foremost on her mind, absently rubbing her fingers\u2014still tingling from the brief contact with his skin\u2014on her denim-clad thigh. \u201cProtect us from what?\u201d</p><p>He sighed harshly.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk about this when we get home. I was stupid to think this could be the place for that discussion,\u201d he deflected cryptically, and her brow furrowed in frustration. She was sick of the diversions and delays. The conversations that started but never seemed to finish. She picked at her food after it arrived and made sure that Kayla ate hers with as little mess as possible. The little glances she sent Bryce\u2019s way revealed that he was merely toying with his food as well.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember our first date?\u201d he asked her, and she smiled at the memory.</p><p>\u201cHow could I forget?\u201d she said, recalling. \u201cYou showed up here at the end of my shift, asked me out, and spent the rest of the evening lecturing me about crime and safety.\u201d</p><p>He snorted.</p><p>\u201cWe also talked for hours about our favorite movies, music, and books,\u201d he reminded.</p><p>\u201cYes. And all the time you kept staring at my mouth.\u201d She hadn\u2019t meant to say that, and when his gaze\u2014which had already been fixed on her mouth\u2014went blistering hot at her words, her breath quickened and the residual tingling in her fingertips spread like wildfire through her body before gathering in the sensitized tips of her breasts. Her bra felt uncomfortably tight, and she could feel the blood slowly inching into her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe the fantasies I was weaving around that mouth,\u201d he said absently, licking his lips as if he could taste said mouth on his tongue. \u201cAnd those mile-high legs of yours. God, I could picture them wrapped around my waist or thrown over my shoulders . . .\u201d Both scenarios had come to fruition the first time he\u2019d gotten her into bed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her breathing quickened even more as she remembered that particular night\u2014he had been insatiable and so very creative. God, she missed him in her bed . . . in her body. She shook herself, tossing a guilty glance at her daughter, who now had her toy phone pushed up against the side of Broccoli\u2019s head so that the doll could \u201cspeak\u201d to Rhys as well. The girl caught her eye and smiled.</p><p>\u201cFirsty, Mummy . . .\u201d Bronwyn sneaked a little peek over at Bryce and could see that his own cheeks had gone a dull red, his pupils were dilated, and his breathing was labored. She recognized the signs of his arousal immediately and knew from the way he shifted in his seat that his jeans were getting a little snug in the crotch area. God, this wasn\u2019t helping their cause. She had to control herself. She couldn\u2019t seem to keep her hands off him for the most part, and it wasn\u2019t doing either of them any good. She looked away from him, trying very hard to ignore what was happening to both of them, and smiled down at her daughter, who was starting to look a little grumpy at being ignored.</p><p>\u201cOkay, sweetie,\u201d she placated. \u201cDo you want water or some juice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuce,\u201d Kayla demanded, and glared defiantly back when Bronwyn leveled a reprimanding stare at her. Her rebellious lower lip started quivering before she sighed dramatically and gave in. \u201cPeese. Duce peese.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d Bryce, who seemed to have gotten a modicum of control over his body, praised her in a hoarse voice. He flagged the server over and nodded at Kayla. When she understood what her father wanted her to do, her tiny chest puffed up with pride, and she smiled winningly up at the younger man.</p><p>\u201cDuce peese.\u201d</p><p>The server grinned.</p><p>\u201cOrange or apple?\u201d He wisely gave her only two choices, and she opted for the apple.</p><p>When the man trotted away, Bryce looked meaningfully over at Bronwyn.</p> <p>\u201cYou know that I\u2019m as hard as a steel pipe for you right now, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBryce,\u201d she squeaked, tossing a scandalized look over at Kayla. The little girl was oblivious to them and craning her neck to see where her new friend\u2014the server\u2014had gone.</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s always been that way between us. From the very beginning,\u201d he pointed out, ignoring her shock. \u201cThat\u2019s another thing I never told you. While I was riveted, charmed, fascinated, and all of that, I was also turned on beyond belief. Aside from not wanting to leave when Pierre did, my body didn\u2019t give me much choice in the matter. I was pretty much incapable of standing upright without shocking every damned person in here that day. Every time I thought I had it under control, you\u2019d smile or something and I\u2019d go to instant attention again. I had a terminal case of wood for most of the first year of our marriage as you know . . . but in those first few months it was damned near impossible to control. I was like a horny teenager with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never quite understood what you saw in me,\u201d she admitted on a whisper, and he sighed quietly.</p><p>\u201cBronwyn, I don\u2019t know how much clearer I can make this, so listen up. To me . . . You. Are. Stunning. Sometimes I can\u2019t stare at you for too long because it almost physically hurts me to look at you. It\u2019s crazy, my chest tightens and burns to the point of actual pain until I remind myself to breathe.\u201d He smiled bittersweetly. \u201cThat has happened more often than I care to reveal. You\u2019re so lovely that something as fundamental as breathing becomes damned near impossible around you.\u201d</p><p>She searched his harsh face for any sign of deception, but his strong jaw was clenched, his eyes almost hard, and she knew that it couldn\u2019t have been easy for him to reveal that particular tidbit to her. She really affected him that strongly.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve stolen my breath on numerous occasions too, you know,\u201d she confessed, reaching over to stroke his jaw. The server chose that moment to return with Kayla\u2019s apple juice, and Bronwyn\u2019s hand dropped down to the table, where she started toying with her dessert spoon.</p><p>She thanked the server for the juice and reached into the baby bag for Kayla\u2019s sippy cup. After transferring the juice from the glass into the cup, she screwed the top on tightly and gave it to Kayla, who was not very happy about having the grown-up glass confiscated.</p><p>She refused to take her juice from the sippy cup, and Bronwyn gave her a sip of the leftover juice in the glass. She refused again and tried to take the glass from her mother. When Bronwyn moved the glass a safe distance away from her, she started kicking up a fuss. She was showing all the telltale signs of a toddler in desperate need of a nap and on the verge of a tantrum. Bronwyn had only to glance over at Bryce before he summoned the server over for the bill. Their conversation was put on immediate hold as their parental roles took precedence.</p><p>They packed up and left the restaurant pretty quickly, and as he drove them home, with a crying Kayla strapped into her car seat, Bronwyn felt a pang of regret over yet another unfinished conversation.</p><p>Bryce found Bronwyn in the conservatory a few hours later, sitting on the sofa with her legs tucked beneath her and a glass of wine in her hand. She was staring pensively out as the sun dropped gracefully into the ocean and set the horizon on fire. It was a beautiful sunset, but if Bronwyn\u2019s somber face was anything to go by, she wasn\u2019t fully appreciating the sun\u2019s last hurrah as it fled from the night. She was running one elegant finger round and round the rim of her wineglass, her restlessness betrayed by the swift, repetitive movement.</p><p>Bryce glanced down at the sheaf of papers he held in his hand and shut his eyes as he sent an uncharacteristic and desperate prayer to a God he hadn\u2019t really acknowledged since he was a boy. He was all out of options here. He had no choice but to give her what she wanted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBronwyn,\u201d he murmured, and she jumped, nearly spilling the wine. She blinked up at him as if surprised to see him standing there. She self-consciously tucked an errant strand of brown hair behind her ear.</p><p>\u201cBryce, you startled me.\u201d He sat down next to her and turned to face her.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that,\u201d he apologized. \u201cI just wanted to give you these.\u201d He handed over half of the papers he was holding, and she put the glass onto a side table to take hold of the documents. She stared blankly down at the big, bold words at the top of the first sheet.</p><p>\u201cThat was fast,\u201d she murmured. He reached over and angled her jaw upward, and she realized that he hadn\u2019t been able to read her lips. She repeated the three words, keeping her face determinedly neutral.</p> <p>\u201cI had them drawn up last week. I gambled on the fact that I knew you well enough to guess which place you\u2019d go for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy bother showing me the other places then?\u201d she asked, and Bryce shrugged. Yes, he\u2019d been confident she would go for the last place, but he had wanted her to have choices and . . . he had wanted to spend time with her.</p><p>His first instinct was to cling to his reticence, but all her accusations of secrecy were valid. He had kept things from her\u2014important things that would probably have made a big difference to their marriage. But if he wanted any kind of future with her, he would have to let go of his fear of appearing weak and vulnerable in her eyes and keep her \u201cin the loop,\u201d so to speak. And if that meant keeping her up to date on the minutia of his every fleeting thought, then so be it.</p><p>\u201cI wanted the choice to be yours. You may have hated that last one. I didn\u2019t want to presume too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet you went ahead and drew up the necessary paperwork?\u201d she asked with an incredulous little shake of her head.</p> <p>\u201cI like to be prepared,\u201d he muttered, abashed. \u201cAll you have to do is sign these and the flat will be yours. Finances have been taken care of.\u201d Naturally.</p><p>\u201cStill you could have taken me to three or four places instead of eight.\u201d</p><p>He sighed and bit the bullet.</p><p>\u201cI also wanted to spend some time with you and Kayla,\u201d he confessed. He could see the shock in her eyes and wondered if it was a result of his words or the fact that he\u2019d actually said them out loud. He watched her luscious lips form an o and took a deep breath before rushing in to the next bit of this ordeal.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to spend some time with you before I gave you these,\u201d he said, holding out a second sheaf of papers. He had a moment\u2019s hesitation when she reached for them and tightened his grip when she tried to take them. After a brief tug of war, he reluctantly released the papers and stepped back. He tried to gauge her reaction, but her usually open face had closed up and revealed not a single emotion as she read the top of the first page. He was breathing in uneven gasps, and he counted slowly to twenty, then thirty, as he tried to regulate his breathing.</p><p>She looked up at him and the impact of her devastated gaze hit him like a two-ton truck. She said nothing for the longest time, and when she spoke her words nearly sent him to his knees in agony.</p> <p>Thank you, she signed.</p><p>Bryce nodded before turning and walking away.</p><p>Bronwyn stared at the signed divorce decree in her hands for the longest time and now understood that the restaurant hadn\u2019t been a counterattack, it had been a farewell. For an endless age shock kept her numb, but by agonizingly slow degrees feeling returned. She felt . . . raw. Her entire body felt like an open, festering wound. She sat perfectly still, afraid to move because even the simple act of blinking was excruciating. When she allowed herself the luxury of crying, it wasn\u2019t a cathartic act meant to heal. Instead the tears lodged in her throat and scalded her skin like acid.</p><p>She had gotten what she had asked for. Her marriage was over.</p><p>Hours later she found herself staring at the front door of the only place she could think of to go. She rang the doorbell, and after several minutes a disheveled-looking Rick opened the door. He blinked down at her in confusion.</p><p>\u201cBron?\u201d</p><p>At the sound of his voice the fragile control she\u2019d managed to exert over her emotions shattered, and she burst into tears and launched herself into his arms. He folded her into his embrace and murmured soothing little sounds into her hair. \u201cWhat\u2019s this now? Shhh, sweetheart, it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay.\u201d He was drawing her farther into the house. And after a few long minutes of inconsolable weeping, Bronwyn surfaced enough to take in her surroundings.</p><p>She was sitting on a sofa, curled up against Rick\u2019s bare chest, which was now slick with her tears. Lisa was sitting on her other side, patting her back comfortingly.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered, her voice hoarse after her extended bout of crying. \u201cYou were asleep. I wasn\u2019t thinking of the time.\u201d They were both dressed for bed. Rick in loose pajama bottoms and Lisa in a tank top and shorts. A quick glance up at the clock on the wall told her that it was nearly midnight.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Rick dismissed. \u201cTell us what happened. You didn\u2019t drive here in this state did you?\u201d</p><p>She blinked in confusion, trying to gather her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cNo. No, of course not. Cal brought me.\u201d She vaguely recalled waking the man up and remembered the concerned glances he kept directing at her via the rear-view mirror. Lisa held up a box of tissues, and Bronwyn gratefully took one and blew her nose.</p><p>\u201cIs Kayla okay?\u201d Rick asked urgently.</p><p>\u201cYes, she\u2019s fine. She\u2019s with B-Bryce.\u201d She stumbled over his name and almost lost it again. \u201cHe signed the p-papers,\u201d she told them, and Lisa\u2019s eyes immediately went soft and sympathetic. Rick merely looked confused. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat papers?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThe d-divorce papers,\u201d she whispered, and Lisa hugged her fiercely.</p><p>\u201cAaah God.\u201d Rick sounded pained.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Bronwyn,\u201d Lisa said.</p> <p>\u201cI thought this was what you wanted.\u201d Rick\u2019s confusion was obvious, and Bronwyn glanced up into his bewildered face.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for the best,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it still hurts, Rick. It hurts so much. I never stopped loving your brother. I just can\u2019t . . . live with him anymore. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Rick sighed and nodded slowly.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I get it. Bron . . .\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cI love you like a sister and while I failed you for a while there, I still want you to be happy. I get that you don\u2019t think you can be happy with Bryce anymore. His behavior was . . . inexplicable. But I hope you understand that I have to go and make sure that he\u2019s okay. You stay here with Lisa, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. This can\u2019t be easy on him.\u201d She was grateful that Bryce would have someone there for him. This wasn\u2019t what he had wanted. He had done it for her because he thought that it would make her happy. \u201cYou\u2019ll need these.\u201d She handed over her house keys and the electronic gate remote. Rick nodded and\u2014after one last hug and kiss for Bronwyn\u2014left the room to get dressed. He returned briefly to let them know he was leaving, and then it was just Lisa and Bronwyn. Lisa took control of the situation, shepherding Bron into the kitchen and pouring some sweet tea down her throat. Bronwyn just couldn\u2019t seem to stop the endless flow of tears.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect it to be this hard,\u201d Bron confessed after Lisa led her to a spare bedroom.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Lisa responded quietly. \u201cI can\u2019t even imagine how this must feel, Bron.\u201d Bronwyn laughed half hysterically.</p><p>\u201cI think the only one right now who has any idea how I feel is Bryce. Can you believe that? Our marriage is over and all I can think is that Bryce would understand how I\u2019m feeling. That I can talk to him about this. It\u2019s so messed up . . . I had to leave the house before I sought him out for comfort. I\u2019m just a walking disaster, Lisa.\u201d</p><p>After aimlessly wandering around the huge house like a lost little boy, Bryce eventually found himself standing in the nursery. That was where he discovered a modicum of peace. He dropped into a rocking chair and watched his precious daughter sleep. He didn\u2019t know how long he sat there, leaning forward with his elbows resting on his knees and his fists folded one over the other. He had his mouth pressed into his knuckles in an effort to keep from uttering the despairing cry that had been lodged in his throat since he\u2019d handed over those papers all those hours ago.</p><p>So absorbed was he in his thoughts that he remained unaware of the third presence that had entered the room until he felt a warm hand cupping the exposed nape of his neck. He jumped, but the hand squeezed his neck reassuringly, and the familiar scent of Rick\u2019s aftershave immediately dampened his fight-or-flight instincts.</p><p>He got up and followed Rick out of the room into the well-lit den. His brother walked over to the liquor cabinet and poured a couple of whiskeys before coming back and handing a glass over to Bryce. The scene reminded him of the one weeks ago when Bronwyn had told him that she\u2019d filed for a divorce, and he forced away the sharp stab of pain as he sat down in the same chair he had occupied that night.</p> <p>They sat quietly for a while, sipping their drinks before Rick set his aside to sign something.</p><p>Bron is with Lisa. Bryce nodded an acknowledgment.</p><p>I know. Cal SMSed me and told me where he was taking her.</p><p>There was another long period where they merely sat and sipped their drinks.</p><p>You okay? Rick\u2019s concern was reflected in his gray eyes and Bryce shrugged.</p><p>No. The sign was curt.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry, Bryce.</p><p>Why? Not your fault.</p> <p>You know what I mean. Bryce sighed and nodded.</p><p>It was inevitable. I don\u2019t deserve her trust. Not after what I did.</p><p>Why did you react that way to her pregnancy? Rick asked, and Bryce stared at the proud and strong man sitting across from him. But all he saw was an earnest young boy with freckles on his nose and a gap-toothed grin, a boy whom Bryce had once protected with every fiber of his being. Bryce had suffered bruises, broken bones, and bloody noses for that kid and given half the chance would do so again. Their father had never touched Rick\u2014had never gotten the chance\u2014and as a result Rick was a well-adjusted man who had never known the evil that Bryce had grown up with.</p><p>He had never wanted Rick to know about it, had kept it from him all these years, but as he stared at his brother he acknowledged that Rick no longer needed his protection and right now Bryce needed to talk about the past.</p><p>\u201cI thought that I\u2019d . . . be like our father,\u201d he said aloud. Rick said nothing, merely kept his gray eyes steady on Bryce\u2019s. It gave Bryce the courage to continue. \u201cI thought that I would be a danger to the baby, or Bron.\u201d Not by a flicker of an eyelash did Rick betray any emotion as Bryce\u2019s story came pouring out. Bryce dropped his eyes, trained his gaze on his glass, and spoke for what seemed like hours. When he risked a glance up at his brother after the words had trickled to a stop, Rick was leaning forward in his chair, with both hands clasped tightly around his glass. His skin was ashen and his eyes gleaming with suppressed emotion.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me this before?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to protect you from that knowledge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProtecting me when I was a kid, sure . . . I get that. Protecting me now? Not so much.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to stain your childhood memories with the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t possibly have done that, since most of my memories involve you and the fun we had . . .\u201d His eyes went distant, and Bryce watched his mouth form a foul word. \u201cAll those so-called sports injuries? He did that?\u201d Bryce nodded, and Rick swore again. \u201cSonofabitch! Shit, Bryce . . . I\u2019m so bloody sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot your fault.\u201d Bryce shrugged.</p><p>\u201cHow many of those knocks did you take for me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not important, and this is why I didn\u2019t want you to know. I didn\u2019t want you to blame yourself. I made a decision to protect you and I did. End of story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell Bron about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her what? That I allowed a dictatorial bastard to use me as a punching bag? That I may turn into the same dictatorial bastard and use my fists on her and Kayla someday? She\u2019s a hell of a lot better off without me.\u201d The words burned like acid but they had to be said.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think you\u2019d hurt Bron or Kayla?\u201d Rick asked him, and Bryce could feel himself growling at his brother\u2019s deliberate ignorance.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in my blood.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah? It\u2019s in my blood too. Think I\u2019d ever harm a hair on Lisa\u2019s or Rhys\u2019s head?\u201d Bryce blinked stupidly, completely thrown by Rick\u2019s question. It wasn\u2019t something that had ever occurred to him.</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? He was my father too.\u201d He watched Rick\u2019s chest heave as the younger man sighed heavily. \u201cBryce, you have to talk to a therapist about this. You have to see that you would never physically harm your wife and child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEx-wife . . .\u201d God.</p><p>\u201cYou have naturally protective instincts, Bryce,\u201d Rick was saying, while Bryce still reeled from the emotional impact of the words \u201cex\u201d and \u201cwife\u201d in relation to Bronwyn. \u201cYou . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d he whispered. \u201cEnough, Rick. Please.\u201d</p> <p>Rick stopped talking but he didn\u2019t make a move to leave, merely got up to refill their drinks and sat down again. He was clearly content to remain sitting for however long Bryce did. Comforted by his younger brother\u2019s stoic presence, Bryce sat immersed in his thoughts for a while longer.</p><p>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p><p>Money certainly made life a lot easier, Bronwyn reflected as she watched the movers bring in the last of her newly acquired furniture. Relocating from Bryce\u2019s house into her new home should have taken a lot longer than it actually had, but with money to grease the wheels, packing up an old life and organizing a new one took less than two weeks.</p><p>She was moved in to her new \u201chome\u201d before she could blink, and all that was left was the unpacking. She tried to turn it in to an adventure for Kayla, who was being surly and uncommunicative.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this a pretty room, Kayla?\u201d she asked, injecting bright enthusiasm into her voice, but Kayla wasn\u2019t having any of that.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, baby, it\u2019s very pretty,\u201d Bronwyn maintained patiently. \u201cYou have a princess bed. Isn\u2019t that great?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I go home.\u201d She had only recently stopped referring to herself in the third person.</p> <p>\u201cThis is our new home.\u201d Bronwyn smiled sunnily and Kayla glared at her, her little lip protruding rebelliously. Bronwyn felt awful to have moved her again so soon, especially since Bryce had become such an important fixture in her life.</p><p>\u201cI want Daddy!\u201d She stamped her foot and Bronwyn\u2019s smile slipped a bit.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see Daddy tomorrow,\u201d she explained. \u201cTonight we\u2019ll sleep in our new home. We can have ice cream. Do you want ice cream, sweetie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you do.\u201d Bronwyn couldn\u2019t help but smile a little at the stubbornness. \u201cChocolate ice cream. Your favorite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI no like ice kweem,\u201d she blatantly lied.</p><p>\u201cHey, Bron, where do you want this box?\u201d Lisa was lugging a medium-size box of photos, and Bronwyn directed her toward the study. Lisa, Theresa, Bobbi, and Alice were all helping with her move and had decided to stick around for one of their Saturday ladies\u2019 nights afterward. Bronwyn welcomed the show of support and the company. She knew that they didn\u2019t want her to be alone on her first evening in the new place.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to help me unpack your clothes?\u201d she asked Kayla. \u201cYou can tell me where to put everything. That\u2019ll be fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Bronwyn sighed. She was heartsick and tired. She hadn\u2019t seen much of Bryce since the night he\u2019d handed her the divorce papers. He had had his attorney contact hers to tell her that he would be giving her a monthly allowance to spend or not spend however she saw fit, and that he would pay to furnish the flat. Bronwyn had tried to refuse but had been told that the money had already been transferred into her bank account and what she did with it was her business. She had decided to give in gracefully and accept the generous alimony.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you show Broccoli our new house?\u201d she asked. Despite the mutinous set of her face, the little girl picked up her well-worn little doll\u2014one of the few toys she still had from their life in Plettenberg Bay\u2014and trudged off.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Theresa asked, coming up to stand beside Bronwyn. Bronwyn glanced over at the pretty woman and shook her head.</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d Her voice wobbled slightly. \u201cI feel like such an awful parent right now. She\u2019d just gotten used to the other house, and here I am, uprooting her again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cChildren are resilient.\u201d Theresa put a comforting arm around her shoulder and gave her a reassuring squeeze. \u201cYou\u2019ll both be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could be so sure.\u201d Bronwyn stifled a sigh before pasting a determined smile on her face. \u201cStill, there\u2019s no use in worrying about it right now. Too much to do.\u201d</p><p>Theresa smiled sympathetically.</p><p>\u201cBronwyn, it\u2019s okay to be emotional about all of this, you know? I can kind of relate to what you\u2019re going through. Sandro and I are happy now but we\u2019ve had some . . . extremely difficult times in the past.\u201d That news surprised Bronwyn. On the few occasions that she\u2019d seen the couple together they had seemed completely devoted to each other. It was hard to believe that they hadn\u2019t always been the perfect couple. \u201cSo anytime you need to talk, or just a shoulder to cry on, I\u2019m there for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat means a lot,\u201d Bronwyn whispered, hugging the other woman gratefully. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>After her friends had left later that night and Bronwyn was alone with her thoughts and her sleeping daughter, she sat down in the darkened conservatory and sadly looked around the still-chaotic room. The place felt alien and a little cold. Even though she had often complained about Bryce\u2019s security team being a blatant invasion of her privacy, she felt a lot safer knowing that Paul had been assigned as the head of her security detail. The man was now in charge of the team that would take care of security for this separate household. It was comforting to know that they were just outside if she needed them. Her cell phone beeped and she dragged it out of her jeans pocket.</p><p>You settle in ok? A smiled tugged at her lips. It was from Bryce.</p><p>All good. A bit messy still.</p><p>Kayla ok?</p> <p>Grumpy. She misses you.</p><p>I miss her. You too.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how to respond to that. She missed him like crazy but telling him that would definitely send a mixed message.</p><p>It\u2019s late. I\u2019m off to bed. It was abrupt but she didn\u2019t want to be charmed by him. She didn\u2019t want to encourage him. They both needed to move on. No matter how painful and difficult it was for them.</p><p>Right. I\u2019ll see you 2m. G\u2019nite.</p><p>She held the phone to her chest for a few long moments before eventually dragging herself up and to bed.</p> <p>The bell jingling above the shop door jarred Bronwyn from her thoughts. She\u2019d been staring down at her notes for about half an hour without actually absorbing any information and\u2014despite it being nearly closing time\u2014a customer would be a welcome distraction. She put what she hoped was a bright, welcoming smile on her face as she raised her eyes. The smile immediately withered when she saw who was standing there.</p><p>Bryce met her eyes with a brief nod before walking farther into the shop. Bronwyn pushed herself halfway out of her chair and then hovered uncertainly between standing and sitting, a puzzled frown on her face. He was supposed to have Kayla today, but there was no sign of the child.</p><p>\u201cBryce?\u201d He didn\u2019t see her question and continued his browsing, picking up a book here and there and reading the back-cover blurbs before replacing them on the shelves. She made her way to him and tapped him on the shoulder. He turned to face her with a polite smile on his face. Baffled by his odd behavior, she frowned and used sign language to ask him what he was doing there.</p><p>\u201cWell, I wanted to learn how to balance my chakras.\u201d He held up a book. His smile remained bland and polite. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve been thinking of buying some healing crystals or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Kayla?\u201d she asked worriedly.</p><p>\u201cI had to go in to the office this afternoon for an emergency meeting and instead of dropping her off at the day-care center, I thought she\u2019d enjoy spending some time with Rhys since it is Lisa\u2019s day off. When I swung by to pick her up a couple of hours later, she wasn\u2019t ready to stop playing. Lisa suggested I let her stay for dinner. So I found myself at loose ends and thought you might like to grab some dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think . . .\u201d God, she was tempted. But their divorce had just been finalized and it seemed like a step in the wrong direction. They had fallen into a comfortable routine over the two and a half weeks since she had moved in to her new place. She dropped Kayla off at his house after breakfast in the mornings on her way to campus, and he brought her home before dinner every night. Kayla stayed over at his house on Friday nights, and Bryce returned her to her mother late Saturday afternoons. Bronwyn had her for the remainder of the weekend. They were coolly friendly when they spoke, and those brief moments in the mornings and evenings when Kayla was handed from one parent to the other were the only times they saw each other. He sent her the occasional SMS during the day, but that was it. It had been a bit of an adjustment for all of them.</p><p>\u201cI think we should try to be friends at least,\u201d he said. \u201cFor Kayla\u2019s sake. It\u2019s just dinner.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s never just dinner with us, Bryce,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d His beautiful blue eyes mutely pleaded with hers, and Bronwyn had another fleeting moment of doubt before doing what she had wanted to all along. She told herself that she was doing it for Kayla\u2019s sake\u2014it was important for the little girl to have parents who got along\u2014but she knew that she was lying to herself. She couldn\u2019t resist the idea of spending time alone with him. He was her weakness, and while spending more time with him wouldn\u2019t help her overcome that weakness, it certainly did a good job of keeping the part of her that craved his company satisfied. It didn\u2019t seem to matter how counterproductive it was. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she consented, determinedly squelching the screeching protests in the back of her mind. She glanced around the empty shop. \u201cI\u2019ll close up and we can get going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGino\u2019s?\u201d Bronwyn smiled radiantly up at Bryce, all the tension that had built up during the drive dissipating. She had followed Bryce\u2019s car to the tiny family-run restaurant in Green Point and had laughed out loud when she recognized the familiar route. Gino\u2019s had been her favorite restaurant back when they had first started dating. She had insisted on going Dutch in those early days and had often suggested Gino\u2019s because of its affordability. The food was good and the atmosphere warm and cozy. They had stopped coming here after their engagement, and Bronwyn had all but forgotten it existed. She was surprised that Bryce remembered it.</p><p>\u201cI thought that you\u2019d like it,\u201d Bryce informed, his voice quiet, before glancing over at Cal, who was hovering behind them as usual, his eagle eyes sharply assessing the streets around them. The silent signal Bryce sent his way was acknowledged with a curt nod as Cal spun on his heel and headed back to the car.</p><p>Bryce put a confident hand in the small of Bronwyn\u2019s back and led her inside the little restaurant. The place was the same as it had always been\u2014noisy, chaotic, and filled with laughing people. A young server led them to an intimate corner in the back and handed them the well-worn leather-bound menus with a smile.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back in a few minutes for your drink orders,\u201d she said perkily after lighting the ubiquitous candle in the center of the round table. It was pretty gloomy in their corner, and Bronwyn worried about Bryce\u2019s ability to lip-read in the bad light.</p><p>Do you need a little more light? she signed, and he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI can see you fine.\u201d He smiled, his eyes running over her face like a silent caress.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She blushed, his blatantly sensual look making her feel more than a little hot under the collar. There were a few moments of silence before Bryce spoke.</p><p>\u201cAre you enjoying the new place?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She said. \u201cKayla\u2019s still having problems sleeping at night though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s confusing for her. She\u2019ll get used to the new routine soon.\u201d His smile was bittersweet. The server came back for their drink orders, and after they had ordered, Bryce refocused his attention on her. \u201cWhat about you? How are you adjusting to your new lifestyle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that much different from life in Plett. Aside from the fact that we have money, of course, and I don\u2019t really have to work and I no longer worry about Kayla when I\u2019m away from her.\u201d She laughed self-deprecatingly before shaking her head. \u201cOkay, it\u2019s a lot different from our life in Plett. Anyway, I miss her, of course, but I know that she\u2019s with you and that she\u2019s safe.\u201d She was half signing every other sentence, still concerned with the lighting in the place.</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d he murmured, his eyes intent on her lips.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she dismissed airily. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve said it before, Bryce, but you\u2019re great with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think I would be,\u201d he admitted awkwardly, shifting uncomfortably in his seat. \u201cBeing around kids is . . . was way out of my comfort zone. I enjoy them but I don\u2019t always feel . . .\u201d</p> <p>He hesitated and she leaned forward intently, sensing that he was considering his next words very carefully.</p><p>\u201cConfident around them,\u201d he completed, his voice kind of fading away on the last word. Baffled, she stared at him for a long moment before shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not quite sure I understand what you mean when you use the word \u2018confident,\u2019\u201d she said bluntly. \u201cConfident in your ability to take care of them, you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, and I don\u2019t trust myself not to lose my temper around them.\u201d Again she could see how difficult that was for him to admit, and she knew that she had to tread very carefully here.</p><p>\u201cKayla does like to test my patience,\u201d she said with a fond smile. \u201cAnd I have lost my temper with her on a few occasions, but it\u2019s all about how you handle the situation, and quite frankly, Bryce, you\u2019re a pushover when it comes to her. She knows that she can get away with way more than she ever could with me.\u201d</p><p>The server returned with their drinks and asked if they were ready to order. They both darted guilty glances down at the menu\u2014they hadn\u2019t even thought about food yet. Recognizing their looks, the girl laughed and promised to return in a couple of minutes. After they had taken care of the business of ordering, Bronwyn turned expectant eyes on him, waiting for him to pick up where he had left off.</p><p>Bryce took what looked like a fortifying sip of his red wine before raising his eyes to meet hers.</p><p>\u201cYou were right when you accused me of keeping stuff from you during our marriage,\u201d he said, surprising her by steering the conversation into a completely different direction. \u201cStuff I felt that you didn\u2019t need to know. Stuff I thought you\u2019d see as weakness. Stuff that I was too embarrassed to tell you. I once told you that you made me feel like an all-conquering hero, that you made me feel like I could take on the world. It really was a heady feeling, Bron. I enjoyed being your \u2018hero,\u2019 the \u2018prince\u2019 who had swept you off your feet.</p> <p>\u201cI never expected to find a woman who made me feel like a hero instead of the villain I\u2019d always believed myself to be. So, instead of telling you everything you needed to know about me, I allowed you to think that I was this perfect man. I spent two years trying to maintain that illusion and trying to live up to the inaccurate impression you had of me. When something went wrong at the office, I bottled it up and kept it from you. I closeted myself away to work it out alone rather than allow my frustration with whatever problem I had to spill over into our lives.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBryce.\u201d She was a little stunned by his revelations and tried to gather her thoughts before responding. \u201cI never expected you to be this perfect heroic husband. I fell in love with a man, not a superhero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know the real man, Bron,\u201d he said heavily. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why I had to sign those papers. I wanted to give you a chance to get to know me. Flaws and all. I wanted us to have a fresh start, to go back to the beginning. I wanted this dinner to be a new beginning for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, let me get this straight, you agreed to a divorce because you wanted us to start dating again?\u201d she asked incredulously. Not quite sure she had understood him correctly.</p><p>\u201cBasically . . . yes,\u201d he confirmed, and Bronwyn felt like the top of her head was about to blow off. She actually lifted a hand to her face, almost certain that steam was billowing from her nose and ears like she was some maddened cartoon character. Unfortunately their server chose that moment to return, and Bronwyn waited impatiently while the woman offloaded the piping-hot, aromatic bowls of pasta and crispy garlic bread onto the table in front of them. As soon as the server left, Bronwyn turned her frowning gaze back on the uncomfortable-looking man sitting across from her.</p> <p>\u201cAnd did you really think, after the emotional turmoil of the last few months, that I\u2019d be on board with this scheme of yours?\u201d she asked, trying extremely hard to rein in her temper, unable to believe the absolute arrogance of the man. \u201cAnd what\u2019s this? Phase One of some big reconciliation plot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no such thing,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI was just hoping you\u2019d understand what motivated me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to start a new, honest relationship by deceiving me into coming out to dinner with you? I mean, what is this if not luring me here under false pretences? I\u2019m not quite feeling the honesty here, Bryce,\u201d she pointed out sarcastically. He had the grace to look repentant.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say it would be an easy habit to break, Bron,\u201d he said uneasily, and she swallowed down the irreverent giggle that wanted to burble from her lips. For some unfathomable reason, she was both irritated and oddly charmed by his flagrant presumption. She felt so many conflicting emotions that she wasn\u2019t quite sure how to approach this crazy new spanner that he had tossed into the works. Part of her wanted to move on and rebuild her life without him in it, a larger part wanted to know why he had such a low opinion of himself. She wanted to know why he thought he was a villain. She didn\u2019t for a second believe that the man she had fallen in love with had never existed, but it disturbed her that he clearly thought that. Still, they couldn\u2019t keep going around in circles like this. It wasn\u2019t doing either of them any good.</p><p>Bryce, I don\u2019t know if I can go another round with you, she signed sadly. It\u2019s so exhausting.</p> <p>\u201cFor now, let\u2019s try to enjoy our dinner,\u201d he suggested. \u201cNothing more, nothing less. Just dinner. Okay?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated for a long moment before nodding with a resigned little sigh.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Just dinner.\u201d</p><p>The rest of the evening wasn\u2019t as strained as Bronwyn had expected it to be after that outrageous conversation. Bryce kept her entertained with his tales of Kayla\u2019s daytime antics. He didn\u2019t touch on the controversial subject of dating again, but it remained there between them, the huge elephant sitting at the table with them.</p><p>The wind was howling when they left the restaurant a couple of hours later, and a combination of rain and hail was viciously pelting down on Cal who dashed over to meet them when they paused under the eaves of the restaurant. The huge black umbrella that Cal held up over his head was being buffeted by the wind, and Bronwyn didn\u2019t have high hopes for its survival. It was mid-June and winter\u2014which had been late in arriving\u2014was gleefully showing off its jagged teeth. Cape Town was notorious for its terrible winter storms, and this one, which had arrived without much warning, looked like it was going to be one of the bad ones. They quickly decided that bringing Kayla home from Rick and Lisa\u2019s place in such bad weather wasn\u2019t a good idea, and they ducked back into the restaurant for a few minutes while Bronwyn called Lisa to ask if Kayla could sleep over. The other woman readily agreed with their decision and put the sleepy little girl on the line to say good night to her parents. Kayla sounded happy enough but Bronwyn was naturally worried, as Kayla had never spent a night away from either of her parents before. After a few more minutes of reassurance, Bronwyn hung up and met Bryce\u2019s concerned gaze.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked, and she nodded, blinking back the sheen of tears. Kayla\u2019s first overnight stay away from her parents was a big deal, and Bronwyn felt more than a little emotional about it.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Bryce gave her a self-conscious one-armed hug. Bronwyn was touched by his masculine awkwardness at the sight of her tears, and she gave him a wobbly smile as he led her back outside. Once again they hesitated under the eaves, where poor Cal had been left waiting.</p><p>I don\u2019t want you to drive home in this weather, he signed urgently. Bronwyn stared out at the deluge and tended to agree with him. She definitely didn\u2019t fancy driving in this downpour. The near gale-force winds didn\u2019t help matters. She bit her lip as she stared out at their cars parked by the sidewalk. Unfortunately Bryce had dismissed Paul before they\u2019d even left the bookshop, stating that he and Cal would ensure that Bronwyn got home safely.</p><p>Cal can drive you. I\u2019ll follow, he signed authoritatively, and she shook her head. She didn\u2019t like that suggestion at all, not with Bryce being an uneasy driver himself, but she knew that protesting for that reason wouldn\u2019t sit too well with his pride. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBronwyn, you can\u2019t mean to argue with me on this matter,\u201d he said aloud. \u201cI know you don\u2019t want to drive in this weather.\u201d</p><p>We can all go in your car, she decided. Paul can pick mine up in the morning.</p><p>He looked a little stunned by that decision but agreed quickly as if he were afraid that she would change her mind.</p><p>Cal\u2014who was proficient in sign language and had been following the conversation\u2014looked relieved that they had made up their minds and ushered them toward Bryce\u2019s sleek car.</p> <p>\u201cDo you think my car will be okay here?\u201d she asked Cal worriedly as he held the car door open for them.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, ma\u2019am, I\u2019ll have one of my guys pick it up tonight,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to inconvenience anybody, and this weather is atrocious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s our job,\u201d Cal said with a polite smile. \u201cWe\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d Realizing that he wasn\u2019t going to bend on the matter, Bronwyn ducked her head and climbed into the back of the car; Bryce followed, his bulk taking up most of the space in the backseat. Bronwyn immediately felt boxed in, but he seemed to be aware of how uncomfortable she was, so he kept to his side of the car. Despite his attempts not to crowd her, Bronwyn was still hyperaware of his larger-than-life presence. Naturally conversation was severely limited because of the lack of light, and she tried not to squirm during the short drive from the restaurant to her new home.</p><p>She unthinkingly tried to start a conversation to alleviate the awkwardness but was immediately aware of the futility of the gesture. The words died in her throat before they had even properly formed. That left her to toy with the buckle of her seat belt, and after a few minutes of restless fidgeting, she jumped when his warm hand closed over her fingers.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t say anything, merely lifted her hand to his lips and dropped a sweet kiss onto her sensitive palm. Her breath caught as she tried to see his face in the gloom, but she couldn\u2019t see anything other than the whites of his eyes. He squeezed her hand reassuringly before dropping it gently into her lap.</p><p>When they arrived at her townhouse, Cal asked her to open the electronic gates and slid the car to a smooth stop right at the front door. He dashed out to open the door on her side, and as she ducked beneath the umbrella he held up for her, she heard the other door open and saw that Bryce had exited the car as well. Before she could utter a word of protest, he had rounded the car and dismissed Cal, taking the umbrella from the other man and walking her to the front door himself. When they reached the lit porch, she turned to him with a nervous smile.</p><p>\u201cThanks for dinner,\u201d she said quickly, not sure what else to say really. He continued to look down at her, his handsome face and hair wet from the lashing rain. He really wasn\u2019t getting much protection from the large umbrella, focusing his attention on keeping her dry instead.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry if you thought I was being deceptive tonight, Bron,\u201d he said after a few long moments of silence. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t my intention.\u201d</p><p>She sighed softly.</p><p>\u201cYou definitely need a little more practice in the full-disclosure department,\u201d she conceded. He looked confused and realizing that he hadn\u2019t quite understood her, she repeated the statement\u2014to the best of her ability\u2014in sign language. The shadows that were lurking in his eyes cleared up at her words, and she was moved by the hope that bloomed on his face. Yes, he had gone about this the wrong way by foolishly using Kayla as a platform to launch his crazy campaign for reconciliation from, but she had to admit that she was intrigued. More than that, she couldn\u2019t deny that she had been profoundly affected by the vulnerability and shocking lack of self-confidence that he had revealed earlier. His words were hard to ignore and impossible to forget.</p> <p>\u201cI guess I\u2019m just a sucker for punishment,\u201d she said aloud, and judging by the smile that lit up his face, he could read that without a problem. \u201cI\u2019m going to Pierre\u2019s birthday party on Saturday, and since Alice told me that you\u2019ll be there too, we might as well go together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d His voice was thick with barely restrained excitement, and Bronwyn found that lack of cool quite sweet.</p><p>\u201cWe can work out the details later.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll fetch Kayla from Rick and Lisa\u2019s place in the morning and bring her home at the usual time,\u201d he said after an awkward pause.</p><p>\u201cThat works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay . . .\u201d</p><p>They stood there for an endless moment leaning toward each other, oblivious to the storm raging all around them. She stared at his mouth, knowing that it was foolish of her to want to kiss him so badly. If nothing else it was premature. Especially since this fledgling relationship that they were trying to build from scratch wasn\u2019t ready for any kind of physical intimacy yet. But Bronwyn ached for it so desperately that she could almost taste him on her lips. His head lowered, hers tilted back, and the world slowed down and . . . stopped. Her senses were so incredibly heightened that she could almost count each individual drop of rain as it hit his face and beaded in his hair and on his long eyelashes. His lips had just barely brushed against hers when the wind caught the umbrella and ripped it from his loosened grip, flipping it inside out in the process. They jerked apart abruptly, both flustered and breathing heavily. Reality shoved its way between them and quite literally dumped a shock-load of icy water all over them both. Bronwyn shuddered when she felt the freezing rain dripping down the back of her neck where the collar of her coat gaped a bit.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou should get inside before you catch a cold,\u201d he urged, ushering her toward the door, and she nodded numbly. She messed up the security code a couple of times before he gently pushed her aside and did it for her with hands that trembled only marginally less than hers. Once he had the door opened, he turned to her, caught her face in his cold, wet hands, and kissed her unceremoniously. There was no finesse to the kiss at all, just raw passion, and Bronwyn was left feeling a little dazed and unsteady on her feet when he released her seconds later.</p><p>\u201cGood night,\u201d he said gruffly, jerking the collar of his soaked coat to protect his already wet neck from the rain and turning to walk back to the car. She stood in the doorway and watched as he gestured at Cal to remain in the car before he climbed into the passenger seat and shut the door in one smooth movement. The car remained standing there after that, and she knew that he wouldn\u2019t leave until she stepped inside and shut the door. She waved at the dark figure in the front of the car before stepping back and shutting the door. As she watched the car head back down her driveway, she sighed and for once tried not to dwell on the definite mistakes that she had made tonight.</p><p>She really was a fool when it came to her relationship with Bryce. She made the same stupid blunders over and over again, but tonight she had seen something in him that had never been there before. She had seen resolution in his eyes as well as an unfamiliar mix of determination and vulnerability. The man she\u2019d been married to would never have let her catch so much as a glimpse of that susceptibility before. It gave her hope.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d Bryce looked almost shy when he brought Kayla home the following evening. The little girl threw herself at Bronwyn and they reconciled like two people who had been separated for months instead of a mere day, showering each other with exaggerated hugs and kisses.</p> <p>After a long and exuberant greeting, Kayla ran off to her room to check if her toys had missed her too, leaving her parents to stare at each other nervously.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Bronwyn returned his greeting and pushed her hands into the back pockets of her jeans as she rocked back and forth on her heels. It had been raining incessantly since the night before, and Bron stared out at the dismal weather over Bryce\u2019s shoulder. He was still standing on the porch, as was his habit when he dropped Kayla off. He never came inside.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s freezing out there,\u201d Bronwyn observed inanely. \u201cDo you want a hot drink?\u201d His eyes lit up at the invitation and he nodded quickly. He turned and signed his intentions to stay at Cal, who was waiting in the car. The other man nodded and sent back an \u201cokay\u201d sign.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done a lot with the place in such a short time,\u201d he said, looking around the homey kitchen as he sat down at the island. He watched as she bustled around the large room, preparing a pot of tea. She sat down across from him a few minutes later with the pot of tea steeping between them.</p><p>To keep her hands busy and her anxiousness at bay, she poured his tea, automatically making it the way he liked it.</p> <p>\u201cDo I make you nervous?\u201d he asked, and her hands stopped their restless movements as she considered his frank question. How like Bryce to cut to the chase.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she replied. \u201cYou don\u2019t but the situation does. Don\u2019t you feel the same way?\u201d</p><p>He took a sip of his tea as he considered her question and placed his dainty teacup carefully back into its saucer before replying.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m bloody terrified,\u201d he admitted with a disarming grin. \u201cTerrified of saying or doing the wrong thing. Last night is a perfect example of me screwing things up without meaning to.\u201d The smile faded and his eyes darkened. \u201cOur entire marriage was an example of me screwing up without meaning to.\u201d</p><p>She honestly had no idea what to say in response to that and was relieved when Kayla came running back into the kitchen with Broccoli clutched to her chest. They were both grateful for the interruption and focused their attention on the little girl, who was talking a mile a minute. After a few minutes of fussing over the child, Bronwyn tapped Bryce on his shoulder to get his attention.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to stay for dinner?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like that very much,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re ordering pizza,\u201d she warned in case he was expecting some miraculous home-cooked meal after she\u2019d spent all day at school and work.</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d He whipped out his phone. \u201cI\u2019ll let Cal know that I\u2019ll be staying a while. He and Paul can order takeout for dinner too.\u201d</p><p>She nodded as she sent Kayla to the refrigerator for the magnetized pizza menu that she kept low enough for the child to reach.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t remember the last time I had pizza,\u201d Bryce said, leaning back against the sofa with a contented groan. \u201cThat was delicious.\u201d</p><p>They were all in the living room, where they had enjoyed an impromptu picnic on the heated carpet. Kayla liked the novelty of eating on the floor and constantly crawled from her mother\u2019s lap to her father\u2019s lap, loving the undivided attention from her doting parents. She was currently sitting on her mother\u2019s lap and Bronwyn could feel the child\u2019s head getting heavier and heavier as she started to doze off. It was getting close to her bedtime.</p><p>\u201cBath time, munchkin,\u201d Bron whispered into her ear.</p><p>\u201cNo baf, Mummy,\u201d the child protested sleepily.</p> <p>\u201cYes bath, Kayla.\u201d</p><p>The little girl was grubby and her face was covered in pizza stains. The child pushed herself up and heaved a long-suffering sigh that nearly had Bronwyn in stitches when she heard it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDaddy baf I?\u201d she asked, probably knowing that her dad would go easy on her. Bronwyn raised a questioning brow at Bryce, who nodded, his gaze tender as he smiled at the little girl.</p><p>\u201cCome on then,\u201d he invited, holding his arms out to her. She toddled into them and he hugged her close for a long moment, shutting his eyes as he inhaled her baby scent. \u201cLove you, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Bronwyn\u2019s heart turned to mush as she watched them. She turned away and busied herself cleaning up the dinner debris as she struggled to keep the waterworks at bay. She kept her back to them as Kayla led him out of the living room and upstairs to the bathroom. She left them to it for about ten minutes while she fiddled about in the kitchen, before she followed them upstairs.</p><p>Bryce was already toweling off a chatty Kayla by the time Bronwyn joined them. He smiled up at her as she entered his field of vision; the look on his face was so warm and unaffected that Bronwyn couldn\u2019t help but smile back.</p> <p>\u201cThat was a fast bath,\u201d she said quietly, and he shrugged.</p><p>\u201cI used the hand shower,\u201d he muttered. \u201cShe\u2019s asleep on her feet as it is. I thought hosing her down would be more efficient in this case.\u201d</p><p>He picked Kayla up and carried her to her girlie bedroom.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s had a busy day,\u201d he explained, dragging a pretty pink nightgown over Kayla\u2019s head. There was a nervous quality to his constant stream of chatter that Bronwyn found endearing. \u201cWe went to the South African Museum this morning. She had a blast, loved the animal and bird exhibits. I had to stop by the office after that so she hung out with her day-care buddies for a couple of hours before lunch. You had fun with your friends, didn\u2019t you, Kayla?\u201d She nodded sleepily, and he grinned as he lifted her onto her bed and tucked her in.</p><p>They spent a few minutes reading the little girl\u2019s favorite nursery rhymes in tandem, which turned out to be an entertaining and unique experience for all three of them. In fact, Bronwyn and Bryce were enjoying the experience so much that they didn\u2019t notice that Kayla had fallen asleep. It was Bryce who first discerned that Kayla was sleeping, and he shushed Bronwyn, who was really getting into her Mother Goose impression. They crept out of the child\u2019s room and paused at the doorway to watch her sleeping for a few minutes.</p> <p>\u201cAt least I managed to get something right, huh?\u201d Bryce said, his voice brimming with pride, and Bronwyn tilted her head back to meet his eyes.</p><p>You got a lot right, Bryce, she signed, and he grimaced\u2014his eyes dull with disbelief\u2014before turning away and heading back downstairs. She followed him, her gaze fixed on the tense set of his broad shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019ll be going,\u201d he said once she had joined him at the foot of the stairs.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she shook her head. \u201cWe have to have an uninterrupted talk, Bryce. I\u2019m open to the idea of a fresh start because I still love you. I\u2019ve never stopped loving you, even when you were being a total arse. I just didn\u2019t think the situation was healthy for us or for Kayla. I felt like our marriage was doomed because I couldn\u2019t see us growing as a couple or as a family when we still had so many unresolved issues between us. You want another chance? Then we\u2019re going to do this properly. No more secrets.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</p><p>Bryce watched her slender back as she led the way back into the living room, and swallowed nervously. This was what he had been dreading from practically the moment he\u2019d first met her. He had tried his best to avoid this \u201ctalk\u201d and had destroyed his marriage in the process. It was time to take a leap of faith and believe that if she still loved him despite his past cruelty, she could love him enough to overlook even his inherent cravenness. After everything that he had put her through, she more than deserved the truth. He just hoped that he was strong enough to face the consequences if she wanted nothing to do with him afterward.</p> <p>She stopped walking and he was so wrapped up in his anxiety that he crashed right into her. They both lost their balance and his hands encircled her upper arms to steady her. For a few breathless moments he had her lithe body plastered right up against his, her back to his front, and his body responded with embarrassing predictability. He released her almost immediately and put a decent distance between them, hoping that she hadn\u2019t felt him hardening against the curve of her firm little behind.</p><p>Focus, Bryce! he snapped at himself, drawing in a shuddering breath. He moved past her and headed directly to the sofa. He dropped down and folded an ankle over his knee in an uncomfortable attempt to hide his erection from her. The damned thing had no sense of occasion and even the gravitas of the situation wasn\u2019t doing much to tamp things down.</p><p>Bronwyn sat down in a chair across from him and stared at him unsmilingly for a few long seconds. That look was more than enough to bring his body back under control. He wasn\u2019t sure how they were supposed to start this conversation and waited to take his cues from her. When she continued to just stare at him, he started to feel uncomfortable and shifted restlessly in his seat. When had she perfected that damned soul-piercing icy stare? It hadn\u2019t been a part of her \u201cirate spouse\u201d repertoire in the past.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said uncomfortably. He was used to silence but he found himself wanting to fill in this particular conversational void with inane words, hoping that it would prompt some kind of response from her. \u201cWell . . .\u201d</p><p>She said nothing, her usually expressive face completely devoid of emotion. She wasn\u2019t going to make this easy on him . . . and really, why should she? He had once told her that he couldn\u2019t fix the damage he had wrought\u2014but quite honestly he hadn\u2019t even tried. He could see that now. He hadn\u2019t tried because he hadn\u2019t felt like he\u2019d deserved to try. Well he was done with being crippled by fear. He could fix it\u2014he would fix it. He just had to take the damned leap. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhen we first met . . .\u201d He broke the silence, and Bronwyn made a relieved little sound at the back of her throat. She was grateful that he had ended the interminable silence even though she hadn\u2019t really expected him to start the conversation without some kind of prompt from her. \u201cYou were the most enchanting thing that I\u2019d ever seen. You so obviously weren\u2019t coping with that job, you looked harassed and you were so horrified when Pierre and I sat down at one of your tables.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t supposed to notice that,\u201d she interjected dryly and then nearly kicked herself for interrupting him. He laughed softly in response to her words.</p><p>\u201cI noticed all right,\u201d he said with a reminiscent little smile. \u201cYour beautiful eyes aren\u2019t very good at hiding your emotions, sweetheart. You were so fascinating. Quite possibly the worst waitress I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d She bit her tongue at that one, but his grin widened at the look on her face. \u201cSee? You didn\u2019t like that. Your eyes don\u2019t lie. Pierre couldn\u2019t understand my fascination, and I, in turn, couldn\u2019t understand how he wasn\u2019t seeing the most bewitching creature in the world. Like I said before, I just couldn\u2019t stay away from you. I kept going back, and the more time I spent with you, the more time I wanted to spend with you. The main reason I proposed\u2014contrary to some of the cruel things I\u2019ve said about it\u2014was because I couldn\u2019t imagine my life without you by my side. You loved me. You had told me so many times and I so desperately wanted to say it back, but I couldn\u2019t. I was so happy with you but I didn\u2019t think that I knew how to love. I wanted you to teach me. I wanted you to make me a better person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d she shook her head.</p> <p>\u201cI know, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m not doing a very good job of this.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cDo you remember the conversation we had that evening after we returned from the aquarium?\u201d She nodded and watched him swallow painfully before throwing back his shoulders like someone preparing himself for battle. He seemed unable to meet her eyes and kept his gaze fixed on the wall behind her.</p><p>\u201cYou asked me what my first memory was,\u201d he said dully. \u201cWhat I told you, about my father, when he broke my arm\u2014what he did wasn\u2019t an accident. It wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019d hurt me, just the first time I remembered it. And I certainly remember every damned time it happened after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God . . .\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t see her words. He still wouldn\u2019t look at her as he continued to speak in a terrifying dead voice. She had unconsciously brought both hands up to her mouth in shock. A part of her had been expecting to hear something like this, but now that he was saying the words, she couldn\u2019t quite believe them.</p><p>\u201cAfter Richard was born,\u201d he never called his brother Richard, but for some reason the formality suited the gravity of the conversation, and Bronwyn didn\u2019t question it. \u201cI had to do everything in my power to deflect the old man\u2019s temper and blows onto me. He never laid one filthy finger on my little brother. I wouldn\u2019t let him. I tried to ensure that Rick remained unaffected by the whole sordid mess. If the mean-spirited bastard had lived longer, I may not have been able to shelter Rick as much, but I was thirteen when he died. Rick was ten and still young enough to genuinely mourn our father. Our mother was just a withdrawn shell of a woman who died a few months before my eighteenth birthday. She died mere months after being diagnosed with ovarian cancer. She didn\u2019t even try to fight it. It was like she\u2019d just given up on life. She\u2019d checked out mentally and emotionally after my father\u2019s accident anyway. I was the one who raised Rick, I took care of him and made sure that he was fed and properly clothed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I thought your family was rich,\u201d she murmured dazedly, but because he still seemed unable to meet her eyes, he didn\u2019t see her words and she waved a little to get his attention before signing them.</p><p>\u201cMoney doesn\u2019t stop an abuser from being abusive. My mother could have obtained the means to take us and leave, but she wasn\u2019t emotionally strong enough to make that decision. He had her completely cowed, and sometimes I hate her memory even more than I do his. She allowed him to hurt me, to hurt her, and if I hadn\u2019t been there to prevent it, she would have allowed him to hurt Rick as well, and I can\u2019t forgive that.\u201d He shuddered at the thought, and his eyes drifted back to the wall. \u201cWe were his perfect family. He had beaten us into submission, and yet he always found more reasons to hit my mother and me.</p><p>\u201cBut like I said, he never got his grubby fists on my brother.\u201d His words were fierce and shaking with outraged pride. \u201cI was a pretty big kid, and the one time I confronted him was just before he died. He went after Rick but I stood up to him, chest to chest, and he backed off.\u201d Bronwyn could picture it, a scared young boy protecting his little brother by bravely facing down a monstrous man, and she had to curl her hands into tight little fists to keep from crying out at the heartbreaking images that were forming in her head.</p><p>\u201cHe hit me only once more after that and then he died, in a freak yachting accident. God, I hated him and that hate festered in me. The beatings I took, the verbal abuse he heaped on me, it all stayed with me and twisted me inside. My mother was pitiful, she couldn\u2019t love us and she was terrified of her own shadow. Rick, I was his big brother, he was duty-bound to love me. Nobody had ever just loved me . . . until you. But I didn\u2019t have faith in your love. I believed that you wouldn\u2019t feel the same way about me if you knew about how I\u2019d let him hit me and learned about what an absolute coward I was. How could you possibly respect me once you understood how I had crawled to get away from him? How I had begged and pleaded with him not to hurt me, how I had pissed myself in fear and pain\u2014more than once . . .\u201d His voice broke on those last words, and she watched his face contort as he fought to control his emotions. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was a lost cause. Her face was streaming with tears, and she reached for him but he flinched away and got up to pace to the window. He didn\u2019t want her to touch him, and she wept for the lonely, hurt child he had been and for the emotionally distant and psychologically scarred man that he had become. He was sharing what he felt were his most shameful secrets, and it broke her heart that he thought this was his shame and not that of the pathetic excuse of a man who had fathered him.</p><p>\u201cI never felt like I deserved you,\u201d he said, keeping his rigid back to her. \u201cBut like I told you before, I just couldn\u2019t stay away from you after that first meeting. I kept making and breaking promises with myself just to spend time with you. When I proposed to you, I thought that I could manage the relationship; that I could keep your love for myself without tainting you, without hurting you. God, what a miserable job I did of that.\u201d He started pacing in front of the window, prowling back and forth like a restless lion and shoving his hands into the pockets of his tailored trousers.</p><p>\u201cThe night you told me you were pregnant . . .\u201d He stopped moving and grimaced as if the memory pained him as much as it did her. He allowed himself a quick, haunted glance at her before turning away again. \u201cI went off the deep end, Bron. I panicked. I couldn\u2019t be a father, not with my history. What if I hit our baby, what if I started hitting you? My mother always told me that my father never touched her until after I was born. She never said as much, but she made me feel like the catalyst to all that violence! What if I was the same? What if our baby\u2019s birth triggered the same reaction in me? What if I hurt you? I c-couldn\u2019t stand that thought, Bron. But then I ended up hurting you anyway, didn\u2019t I? I hurt you with my wild accusations and the irrational and stupid things that I said. Words can be even more painful than fists, I knew that, but I still couldn\u2019t seem to stop myself! I didn\u2019t even believe the crap I was saying. And I honestly did think that you would end up hating me for getting you pregnant in the middle of your studies, that you would grow to resent me.\u201d He shook his head and sat down opposite her again.</p><p>\u201cThis is going to sound like some lame, stupid excuse, but that night, when I told you to leave, I wanted to give myself time to think and to breathe. I never meant for you to leave the house, Bron, just the room. I calmed down almost immediately and realized what a fool I was being. I didn\u2019t know what kind of father I\u2019d be, but I figured that with you by my side I could possibly be okay. I\u2019d taken care of Rick practically from the moment he was born, without once hurting him, and the thought of raising a hand to you is so abhorrent that it sickens me. I stopped thinking of us as a couple and started imagining what it would be like to be a family. The thought of anyone, especially me, hurting you or Kayla is unbearable, but how do I know something won\u2019t set me off someday? How can you ever trust me around her, knowing what you do about me now?\u201d</p> <p>Bronwyn had her hands pressed over her mouth again as she tried to muffle her sobs, but she was wholly incapable of preventing the tears from flowing down her cheeks. She was a mess. She wanted to go to him but she knew he would not permit it, not until after he had said his piece. Yes, the emotional wound had been lanced, but the pus that had been festering away beneath the surface for so long had to drain before the healing process could begin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d just made up my mind to tell you everything,\u201d he continued in the same rambling, disorganized way that had characterized his entire monologue up till now. He was bouncing between the past and the present\u2014just stating his thoughts as they popped into his head. \u201cI heard your car starting up and I panicked, I was so sure that you would hurt yourself. I immediately gave chase and had my accident. Thinking I saw you there, I think it was the only way I could cope with having driven you away. I think that my subconscious had to have you betray me, because it gave me an excuse to tell myself that I hated you. I needed that excuse because knowing that I was to blame both for your leaving as well as for my deafness would have sent me even further off the deep end.</p><p>\u201cBut I never stopped looking for you, Bron, and it wasn\u2019t just about finding the baby. I think that part of me always knew that you would never have done what I accused you of doing, so I had to find you to be sure you were both okay. I was so ashamed of my behavior that I even withheld the news of your pregnancy from Rick and Pierre. What I\u2019d done was completely inexcusable, and both Pierre and Rick would have had no qualms about letting me know that.\u201d He raised his eyes to hers and winced when he saw her tears. His jaw clenched and his hands curled into tight fists before he lowered himself from the sofa to kneel directly in front of her chair. He placed his hands on the armrests, effectively caging her in, but she didn\u2019t feel trapped. Far from it. She felt . . . liberated.</p><p>\u201cI was such a fool, Bronwyn.\u201d His voice had lowered and she wasn\u2019t sure he knew that he was speaking barely above a whisper. She had to strain to hear him. \u201cI\u2019m a wreck of a man and I brought you into this hell with me and ruined your life in the process.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t ruin my life,\u201d she protested, but he shook his head at her denial\u2014not believing her.</p> <p>\u201cIt sounds crazy to say that I loved you too much and that my love destroyed us, but I feel like that\u2019s what happened. I\u2019m toxic. I\u2019ve always known that and to even consider a fresh start with you . . .\u201d He laughed bitterly. \u201cI\u2019m a selfish idiot.</p><p>\u201cDo you love me?\u201d she asked him quietly, and he blinked at the question. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked blankly.</p><p>\u201cWell, you just said that you loved me \u2018too much.\u2019\u201d She rolled her eyes. \u201cAs if that\u2019s such a bad thing. But you used the past tense. So do you still love me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a stupid question,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a valid question,\u201d she dismissed.</p> <p>\u201cOf course I love you,\u201d he nearly shouted. \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of me not loving you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg to differ,\u201d she interrupted, waving her hands at him. \u201cIt\u2019s very much a question of you not loving me. You never told me you loved me. Not once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, when we married, quite honestly, I didn\u2019t even know I loved you. I told you, I\u2019d never had anyone love me for no reason before. I didn\u2019t bloody know what love was!\u201d His voice rose on the last three words, but she merely raised her eyebrows at him.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what it is now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he whispered. \u201cYes, I know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s . . . it\u2019s . . .\u201d He floundered for a few moments before inhaling deeply. \u201cIt\u2019s everything, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s the quiet dinners when not much gets said. It\u2019s the sunny days at the beach. It\u2019s hearing your laughter in my head when I see Kayla giggling. It\u2019s seeing the love in your eyes when you watch our baby sleep. It\u2019s watching the sun rise in your smile and set in your tears. It\u2019s the contentment in seeing you eat and sleep and study and play. It\u2019s the small, everyday things, like never getting tired of watching you tuck that same stubborn strand of hair behind your ear twenty times a day, and it\u2019s the huge life-altering things like seeing your smile and my eyes on our beautiful little girl\u2019s face. It\u2019s knowing that even if you turn away from me forever, I\u2019ll always be the better for having had you in my life.\u201d</p><p>She leaned forward and stared deeply into his grave blue eyes for an endless moment before reaching out to cup his strong and stubbled jaw with her slender hands. He had trustingly laid his beautiful, wounded soul into her keeping, and she would protect it fiercely.</p><p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d she whispered wonderingly as the edges of her lips tilted up into a tiny smile. She formed her words as clearly as she could, not wanting him to misunderstand her. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking for you.\u201d His stern brows lowered in confusion, and she leaned down to press a feather-soft kiss to his sensuous lips before easing back so that he could see her face again.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s the man I married.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened as her words registered. He swallowed and then swallowed again, his Adam\u2019s apple bobbing with the movement. She watched him valiantly try to keep it together, to remain strong as usual\u2014but her steady gaze seemed to completely unravel him. His shoulders heaved as he drew in a convulsive breath, and the sound that tore loose from his chest when he exhaled again was an unmistakable sob.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she said, stroking one hand down the side of his face, and it was that gentle touch that undid him completely. His face crumpled, his eyes filled, and he finally, finally, dropped every single defense that he had built up over the years and allowed himself to weep. He tried to turn away. Even after everything that he had just revealed, his first instinct was to weather this storm of emotion alone; but Bronwyn wouldn\u2019t let him.</p><p>She put her arms around his neck and held on tight. His head dropped into her lap and she folded herself over him so that she was wrapped around him. She crooned the same soothing little sounds that she used when Kayla cried, hoping that he could feel the slight vibrations coming from her chest and throat. His weeping was raw, violent, and gut-wrenching. Her own tears had all but blinded her, but she was determined to be strong for him, and she refused to allow them to overwhelm her. This moment was for this beautiful man who was so very terrified of allowing himself to be happy.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she whispered into his hair. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Bryce.\u201d The words were ridiculously inadequate of course. It was very far from okay, but she was still processing the ugly truth and trying to figure out how to deal with everything he had revealed. He was so very, very damaged, but his revelations only gave her deep and abiding love for him a sharply protective edge. She would be damned if she\u2019d allow him to spend one more second thinking that he wasn\u2019t deserving of her love. She now understood that the mistakes he had made had been his twisted and misguided attempts to protect her from the monster he believed himself to be. The realization was heartrending, and her scorching tears slid silently down her face and into his soft hair.</p><p>It felt like hours later when his sobs came to a shuddering stop. For a moment he simply allowed himself to rest in her arms, before she felt the tension creep back into his big body, and he lifted himself out of her loving hold and moved to stand beside the window again. He kept his eyes averted as he self-consciously tugged at his dress shirt, which had wrinkled beyond repair. She watched as his ravaged face closed up and shook her head with a sigh before standing up and placing herself squarely in front of him, giving him no option but to meet her eyes.</p><p>She had carefully weighed all of her possible responses to his tormented disclosures and knew that there was only one way to play this without stomping all over his fragile male pride.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot,\u201d she said quietly, and he blinked in confusion.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could you even think that you\u2019re capable of hurting Kayla or me?\u201d she asked, rolling her eyes to convey exasperation. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some huge arguments in the past, and I\u2019ve never felt remotely threatened by you.\u201d</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBronwyn, I always walked out in the middle of our arguments, remember? It used to drive you crazy, but every time I felt myself getting too angry, I\u2019d rein in my temper and walk out because I was so terrified that I would hurt you physically.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBryce, what\u2019s the angriest you\u2019ve ever been with me?\u201d she asked him gently, and he shrugged helplessly.</p><p>\u201cWhen you told me you were pregnant?\u201d His statement came out in question form, as if he wasn\u2019t entirely sure of his answer.</p><p>\u201cNo you weren\u2019t angry then,\u201d she denied. \u201cYou were afraid to allow yourself to hope and lashed out because of that fear. I know that now. I\u2019m talking about real anger. The kind that makes you feel like your head\u2019s going to explode.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He looked confused. \u201cI don\u2019t think that I\u2019ve ever allowed myself to get too angry with you,\u201d he admitted, and she snorted, showing her disdain with a dismissive flick of her wrist.</p><p>\u201cPlease, I can recall several incidents off the top of my head. Like the time I told Rick that you enjoyed getting the occasional manicure with me. You were so furious you were practically breathing steam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I was pissed off,\u201d he admitted uncomfortably, looking a little uncertain. \u201cJustifiably so, since Rick has never really let me hear the end of it. He still makes the odd snarky comment about it. But that\u2019s petty stuff. I\u2019d hardly hurt you over something so trivial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? Your father never beat you over trivial things then? Like a three-year-old\u2019s accidently dropping a watch into a toilet bowl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a gold watch,\u201d he muttered.</p> <p>It was a watch! she signed fiercely. \u201cGold, diamonds, whatever. Breaking a three-year-old child\u2019s arm because of it isn\u2019t a normal reaction. What if Kayla did the same thing? Would you hit her? Break her arm?\u201d He paled at the question and shook his head in unconscious rejection.</p><p>\u201cNo, you wouldn\u2019t,\u201d she answered for him. \u201cOf course you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about when we were on our honeymoon and I danced with Sasha Tisdale? You nearly went purple with jealousy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still remember that jerk\u2019s name?\u201d he asked incredulously. The same jealousy flared in his eyes again, and she grinned irreverently.</p><p>\u201cWell he was really, really good looking,\u201d she reminded, and he glowered, starting to look less shocked and more like the arrogant man she knew and loved beyond all reason.</p> <p>\u201cSeriously? You think that second \u2018really\u2019 was warranted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only left off the third one in deference to your fragile ego,\u201d she teased. \u201cBryce, you were beyond irrational about that dance. You were jealous and possessive but nowhere near violent. Now, I\u2019m no expert, but from what I\u2019ve read about abusive spouses, they barely need an excuse to trigger the violence. Even when you were emotionally hurtful\u2014even then\u2014you were punishing yourself more than me.\u201d She switched to sign language. It\u2019s just not in your nature to be violent.</p><p>How do you know that? How can you be sure? he asked, his eyes were filled with anguished uncertainty, and she cupped his jaw before going up on her toes to plant a kiss on his gorgeous mouth.</p><p>\u201cBecause even at your most irrational, when I thought you were kicking me out of the house and then after my return when you seemed to hate me so much . . . I never once feared you. Not once, Bryce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he whispered, shutting his eyes and ducking his head. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m . . .\u201d</p><p>She stopped his words with a soft kiss, and his eyes opened and met hers. She ended the kiss with a smile.</p><p>\u201cI know you are,\u201d she acknowledged. \u201cI forgive you, Bryce, and I love you very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p> <p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cOf course I do. I don\u2019t think that our problems have been miraculously resolved by any means. I think that we have a long, hard road ahead of us actually. But I think that we can finally move forward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been going back to therapy,\u201d he admitted softly. \u201cIt\u2019s been . . . helpful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope that we can go together sometime,\u201d she said, and he nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d He stared down at her with something like awe in his eyes before shaking his head in disbelief. \u201cHow the hell did I get so lucky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got lucky too, you know,\u201d she pointed out, and wrapped her arms around his waist. \u201cLast night I said that I fell in love with a man not a superhero. But you know what? You are my hero, Bryce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you say that after everything that\u2019s happened and everything that you\u2019ve heard tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBryce, if anything, tonight has taught me that you\u2019re the kind of man who would place himself squarely between his family and any threat. Of course you\u2019re a hero. Mine, Kayla\u2019s, Rick\u2019s . . . never doubt that.\u201d</p><p>Bryce stared down into the tear-ravaged face of this woman who meant the world to him and saw sincerity shining up at him. It was in her eyes and in her smile, and the relief that coursed through his body nearly buckled his knees. For the first time in longer than he could remember, he really felt like everything was going to work out. That somehow, against all odds, he had managed to redeem himself and win his wife back. The panic and fear that he\u2019d been living with for more than two years\u2014no, even longer than that\u2014since they had first married, was dissipating and he felt years younger. He captured her mouth with his own and kissed her with desperation that bordered on obsessive. When he eventually felt able to let her go, they were both flushed and breathless. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to marry you someday, Bronwyn Kirkland Palmer,\u201d he told her with a cocky grin, and she licked her lips dazedly.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a timeline on that wedding date, Mr. Palmer?\u201d she asked him sweetly.</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t rush me, lady. We\u2019ve only just started dating. I have big plans for this courtship, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? What kind of plans?\u201d she asked, curious, rubbing her body sensuously against his. He smiled gently before cupping her face and tilting her head back for another one of his drugging kisses.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re just going to have to wait and see,\u201d he muttered, his voice alive with promise.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</p><p>TWO MONTHS LATER</p><p>I haven\u2019t been back here since before the accident,\u201d Bryce told Bronwyn as they stepped into their beautiful holiday home in Knysna. They had arrived after dark and so had missed out on the house\u2019s spectacular panoramic views of the gorgeous lagoon and Knysna Heads. Still, the serenity of the place was reflected in the sounds of the quietly chirruping night insects and the susurration of the gentle waves lapping at the shore. Bronwyn was filled with mixed emotions as she stepped into the huge stone foyer. The last time she had been here hadn\u2019t been a happy time for her, and as she glanced around the gorgeously appointed house, all she could see was her former self disconsolately drifting from room to room like a lonely little ghost as hope faded to despair with every passing minute.</p><p>The domestic staff had been in before their arrival since the place was freshly cleaned and the refrigerator restocked for their weekend here. He hadn\u2019t told her that this was where he was bringing her, but she had easily recognized the unmistakable Garden Route and had known for hours where they were headed. The drive had become more and more tense with every kilometer that the car ate up, and the last hour had been mostly quiet without Kayla around to break the silence. They had asked Rick and Lisa to take the little girl for this weekend that Bryce had so carefully been planning for weeks.</p> <p>Bronwyn wandered into the living room and he trailed after her, dropping their bags in the hallway. She made her way to the floor-to-ceiling window that overlooked the tranquil lagoon. Because of the pitch-blackness outside, she could see nothing but her own troubled reflection staring back at her, and she tracked Bryce\u2019s movements as he came up to stand behind her. He placed his hands on her slender shoulders and tugged her back until she was leaning against his chest. She went willingly into his loose embrace, her head tilting back until it rested just below his shoulder. His strong arms folded around her narrow waist, his hands rested against her abdomen, and his lightly stubbled jaw nuzzled into the nook just below her ear. She could feel his gentle, warm breath washing against the sensitive skin of her ear as he exhaled deeply.</p><p>\u201cI know this place holds some pretty unhappy memories for you,\u201d he murmured, his lips brushing against her earlobe as he spoke. \u201cI want to replace those memories with sweeter ones.\u201d</p><p>She dropped her hands and entwined her fingers with his.</p><p>\u201cWill you give me the chance do that for you, Bron?\u201d he asked thickly, and she blinked away the tears before nodding. She watched his reflection in the glass and saw the naked relief on his face at her response.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said before sucking her delicate lobe into his mouth. She dragged in a harsh breath at the sensation. His hands moved to the curve of her waist, and he turned her around before she fully understood what his intention was. She had her hands braced against his broad chest and could feel the accelerated beat of his heart as he stared down into her eyes. He had looped his arms around her waist and his hands were now resting just above the curve of her behind.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been years since I kissed you last,\u201d he observed urgently, his eyes dropping down to her lips and dilating when she sucked her full lower lip into her mouth to moisten it.</p> <p>\u201cIt has been years,\u201d she agreed\u2014even though it had been mere hours. Ever since they had started seeing each other again, they had been getting increasingly hot and heavy with the petting, and while they had gotten close to making love, they had always stopped before the point of no return. Neither of them wanted to muddy the waters with sex before they both felt that their relationship was strong enough to withstand all emotional and physical obstacles. They would not rush into bed until they were both completely ready for it. Somehow, by unspoken mutual agreement, they knew that this weekend would see them consummating their new relationship. Bryce had known it when he had planned the trip, and Bronwyn had known it when she had agreed to go with him.</p><p>He groaned and dropped his hungry mouth onto hers and just about ate her alive. Bronwyn met his desperate kiss with feverish concentration, her tongue dueling with his in a battle for supremacy. The kiss eventually gentled, and his hands lifted to cup her face as he tilted her head for easier access to her mouth. He loved holding her face when he kissed her; his thumbs were always restlessly stroking her soft skin, brushing over her cheekbones and tracing the delicate line of her jaw. After a long while, he eased up, his tongue retreated, and his mouth softened as he feathered butterfly kisses on her lips and up over her cheeks and down into her neck.</p><p>Their kiss had been mostly silent, punctuated by heavy breathing and the occasional gasp or desperate moan. Now, as he lifted his head to stare into her eyes, he smiled gently down at her.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he whispered, and Bronwyn\u2019s face lit up as she smiled radiantly at him.</p><p>\u201cI know you do, Bryce . . . but I never get sick of hearing those words,\u201d she told him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, since I\u2019ll never get tired of saying them, I guess we\u2019ll have to resign ourselves to making each other revoltingly happy for the rest of our lives.\u201d He stepped away from her reluctantly, and Bronwyn had to bite back her protest as his gorgeous\u2014and visibly aroused\u2014body moved beyond her reach. When she unconsciously raised one of her hands toward him, he tut-tutted and waved a finger back and forth in front of her face</p><p>\u201cHands off the merchandise, lady. I have plans for this evening and I can\u2019t have you distracting me. Why don\u2019t you head up for a nap and a shower? And chat with Kayla like you\u2019ve been dying to do for the last hour? Leave me to prepare our dinner.\u201d</p><p>She grinned at the thought of him bumbling about in the kitchen. He really wasn\u2019t the domestic god he seemed to think he was. He made a terrible mess and his meals were often culinary disasters, with unpalatable over- or undercooked dishes. Still, he tried\u2014bless him\u2014and she appreciated his efforts. He was always so disgustingly pleased with himself that she didn\u2019t have the heart to mention the occasional raw potato or the burned edges on a steak. She blew him a little kiss and headed toward the hallway, picking up her overnight bag along the way.</p><p>\u201cDress code?\u201d she turned to ask him, and he shrugged.</p> <p>\u201cCasual.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and turned away again.</p><p>\u201cGive the munchkin my love.\u201d</p><p>She flicked him a thumbs-up to acknowledge his request.</p><p>She made her way back downstairs an hour later, feeling refreshed after a short nap and a long shower. She had also called Kayla to say good night but the little girl had been distracted by a game she was playing with Rhys and Rick, so the call had been a little rushed. She had taken Bryce at his word and hadn\u2019t dressed up, wearing only a pair of jeans and a loose T-shirt. She hadn\u2019t bothered with shoes at all; the under-floor heating kept her feet warm enough</p> <p>Whatever Bryce was cooking up in the huge kitchen smelled surprisingly good. She was a little mystified when she got to the kitchen and saw no trace of him. Curiously, she poked around a few of the scattered Tupperware containers left on the white marble top of the gorgeous stone island in the middle of the kitchen. The whole house had a spacious log cabin feel to it, with its stone floors and wooden walls and high-beamed ceilings. Unfortunately her search yielded little in the way of answers except to inform her that whatever Bryce was offering for dinner was of the stick-in-the-microwave-and-heat variety. Which could only mean that he had asked someone else\u2014probably Celeste\u2014to cook it. She smiled ruefully at his minor deception, but her taste buds were truly grateful.</p><p>She heard a sound coming from the living room and headed in that direction. She found him out on the large, covered balcony, which had a spectacular view of the lagoon. In fact, they were so close to the water that it actually felt like they were on a boat out on the lagoon when they stood on the balcony. In winter, they were able to enclose the space entirely by slotting in glass panes between the eaves and the balcony railing. It allowed them to still enjoy the view without being exposed to the cold wind and rain. It was a pretty mild evening, so Bryce had a couple of the panes open, allowing the night sounds and the fragrant briny air to drift in.</p><p>He was bustling around the round table that he had shifted into the center of the balcony. It was covered in a white tablecloth\u2014the finest linen of course\u2014and he had pulled out all the stops, bringing out the best china and silverware for the occasion. He also had a gorgeous bouquet of red roses in a crystal vase as the centerpiece of the table. He was currently struggling to keep the candles lit. Every time he managed to get one tiny flame burning, a breeze would snuff it out, and he was starting to curse under his breath. She giggled to herself when he tried again, only to be foiled by another mischievous gust of wind.</p><p>She lovingly traced the lines of his strong back with her eyes and saw that he had changed his clothes. He was wearing a pair of faded jeans that conformed beautifully to the gorgeous curve of his firm butt and a black dress shirt with a pair of running shoes. His hair was damp and a bit messy, so he must have showered sometime in the last hour.</p><p>He swore even more vituperatively than before, and she rolled her eyes before walking up to stand beside him. He was so absorbed in his task that he didn\u2019t notice her until she placed a hand on his back. He jumped before relaxing when he saw that it was Bronwyn.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t get the damned things lit,\u201d he groused, gesturing to the two tall, white candles beautifully showcased in their sterling silver holders. Bronwyn twined her arm around his and sandwiched his large hand between hers. She rested her cheek against his hard deltoid and contemplated the problem, while idly playing with his fingers before straightening up and smiling at him. The living room light illuminated the balcony just enough to enable them to see each other. She held up a finger indicating that he should wait there before dashing back inside for a few minutes.</p> <p>She returned with a triumphant smirk, holding up four little scented Glade candles in glass holders. They usually kept them around for candlelit baths. He grinned and grabbed a couple of the glasses from her.</p><p>\u201cVanilla? My favorite,\u201d he announced happily as he placed them strategically around the table. After they were lit, he frowned doubtfully at the scant light they offered. \u201cAre there any more?\u201d he asked, and she nodded.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to ruin your dinner by having the whole place reek of vanilla. Everything would taste like cake, she signed.</p><p>Fair point, he acknowledged.</p><p>\u201cI think this is perfect.\u201d She waved her arm at the table and he smiled. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI think you\u2019re perfect.\u201d She snorted at that unnecessary bit of flattery, and he grinned again, sweeping her up in a hug.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starving,\u201d he growled, nipping at her neck to let her know exactly what he was starving for. As if the erection insistently pushing against her wasn\u2019t proof enough of that. She giggled and pushed him away.</p><p>\u201cDown, boy,\u201d she teased. \u201cI want to see what culinary feast you\u2019ve prepared for us tonight.\u201d She didn\u2019t miss the flash of guilt in his eyes as he uncovered the chafing dishes at the other end of the beautifully decorated table.</p><p>\u201cWe have\u201d\u2014he cleared his throat nervously, keeping his eyes averted\u2014\u201croast beef soup with cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, followed by salad with vinaigrette dressing.\u201d More throat clearing. He really was getting truly awful at deception. \u201cStuffed flank steak served with baby potatoes in a garlic butter sauce, and triple chocolate mousse for dessert.\u201d</p> <p>Her lips twitched at his discomfort as he raised miserable eyes to hers, and when he saw her gentle smile, he heaved a huge, sad sigh.</p><p>\u201cYou know, don\u2019t you?\u201d he asked wretchedly, and she nodded. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I wanted everything to be perfect tonight, and I didn\u2019t think burned meat and hard potatoes would cut it this time.\u201d Again his gaze shifted slightly to the left of her as his cheeks lit with shame. She put a soft hand on his jaw and turned his head until he was looking at her again.</p><p>\u201cBryce, you\u2019re a man of many talents . . . unfortunately, cooking isn\u2019t really one of them. I love you for trying and even though those other meals weren\u2019t perfect, I enjoyed them because of the love that went into the preparation. That said, this looks truly delicious, and I\u2019m happy you decided to forgo cooking tonight. Where did this come from? Initially I thought you may have asked Celeste to prepare something for us, but this doesn\u2019t at all resemble anything she has cooked for us before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s from a local restaurant. They delivered it earlier when the housekeeper was still here. They left very specific instructions on how to reheat everything. I hope nothing has dried out or spoiled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be fine.\u201d She waved aside his concern. He helped her into her chair and draped a napkin over her lap with flair. He sat down to her left and angled his chair so that he could see her face and hands clearly. The meal was divine, and they joked and fed each other as they devoured the food in front of them. They had made their way through half a bottle of delicious Cabernet Sauvignon, and as they licked the last of their chocolate mousse off their spoons, Bryce reached for the bottle to refill their long-stemmed wineglasses with the burgundy liquid. He raised his glass and eyed her expectantly. She smiled and raised hers as well.</p> <p>\u201cI know that I\u2019m not the easiest guy to get along with, Bron,\u201d he murmured, his voice shaking. \u201cAnd that when you decided to give this relationship a second chance, you also took on a whole boatload of my emotional crap.\u201d His voice wobbled, and he paused to gain control of his emotions. \u201cI\u2019m just so happy that you gave me another chance.\u201d</p><p>She knew that. His ebullience over the last couple of months had been hard to miss. He was still terrified of losing his temper around her and Kayla, but Bronwyn wasn\u2019t above pushing his buttons in order provoke a response from him. She trusted him not to hurt them, but she wanted him to trust himself too. Their therapist, in a one-on-one session with Bronwyn, had suggested that course of action, and they were making progress. He had lost his temper with her just two weeks before, after Bronwyn had ditched Paul while she was out shopping.</p><p>Recognizing how furious he was after Paul had informed him of her transgression, she had deliberately gotten belligerent in an effort to get him to lose his icy control and had then watched in unflinching awe as her ex-husband completely lost his legendary composure for the first time in her memory. He had ranted, raved, paced, growled, and even snapped a pencil, but he hadn\u2019t even gotten close to harming a hair on her head. After he had calmed down, she had smugly kissed him and murmured, \u201cYou don\u2019t scare me, big man. But I promise to be more careful in the future.\u201d He had looked a little dazed after that and slightly mollified by her words. But the look of befuddled self-discovery in his eyes had been one of the sweetest things she had ever seen. After that he had stopped carrying himself like a man tiptoeing on eggshells around Bronwyn and Kayla.</p><p>Bronwyn had learned a lot more about him over the last two months than she had dreamed possible. At first it had been a little disheartening to discover just how much he had kept hidden from her in the past, but at the same time she had recognized that he was fundamentally the same man that she had fallen in love with all those years ago.</p><p>\u201cSometimes,\u201d he was saying, still in that low, rough voice that shook with the force of his emotions, \u201cI wonder how the hell I got so lucky. I don\u2019t deserve you, no matter what you say, and I am awed, humbled, and so damned grateful that you\u2019re in my life.\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat and carefully placed his glass back on the table before, quite unexpectedly, dropping out of his chair and on to one knee in front of her. Confused by the clumsy movement from her usually graceful ex-husband, Bronwyn wasn\u2019t sure what was happening at first until he started patting at the breast pocket of his shirt. Flabbergasted, she watched as his eyes flared in panic and his hands dropped down to his jeans pockets and frantically started digging around in them. She started to get an inkling of what his intentions were and tried to hide her grin at this less-than-suave proposal.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDamn it, I wanted it to be perfect,\u201d he was muttering to himself, but she didn\u2019t think that he was aware of the fact that he was speaking out loud. He fumbled with something small and gleaming that he pulled out of the same breast pocket he had abandoned just moments ago. When he raised his vulnerable gaze to hers once more, there was sweat beading his forehead, and his breath was coming in ragged gasps.</p><p>\u201cI played this out in my head so many times,\u201d he confessed hoarsely. \u201cI envisioned hot-air balloons, brass bands, and huge, extravagant spectacles. But in the end, perfection for me was having you to myself in a private place where I could beg you to end my miserable, lonely existence without you. You give my life purpose and meaning. Every beat of my heart belongs to you. I love you, Bronwyn. Please marry me.\u201d He opened the palm of his hand and Bronwyn gasped when she saw the ring lying there.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you find this?\u201d she whispered, her eyes going misty. It was her ring, the one he had given her after his first proposal . . . the one she had so reluctantly sold years ago. \u201cHow did you track it down? I never even told you the name of the shop I used.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI e-mailed pictures of the rings to just about every pawn shop proprietor on the Garden Route. It took a while but eventually one e-mailed me back with the information I needed. He had sold it to an elderly lady who said that it reminded her of her own wedding set. She\u2019s a regular customer of his and luckily had enough of a romantic heart to sell the set back to me when she heard why I needed it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe set? You have the wedding ring too?\u201d she asked in disbelief, and he nodded somberly.</p><p>\u201cYes . . . I wasn\u2019t sure you\u2019d want the rings back, but I took a chance that you\u2019d recognize it as a symbol of my enduring love for you. I may not have known it but I loved you the first time I proposed and never stopped loving you. Not once. If you want something else, I could . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare,\u201d she choked out the words. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll marry me?\u201d he asked hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019ll marry you,\u201d she said with a watery smile, cupping his jaw before leaning down to plant a kiss on his beautiful mouth. \u201cI love you too. So much!\u201d</p> <p>He started grinning like an idiot before clumsily placing the ring on her finger. They both stared down at the gleaming diamond and emerald cluster before Bryce lifted her hand to his mouth and dropped a lingering kiss on the ring.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t take it off again,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d she promised fervently. \u201cNever.\u201d She kissed him again, winding her arms around his strong neck and toying with the hair at the nape of his neck. She felt him tense as he pushed his way to his feet, taking her with him. She refused to relinquish her hold on him, and he wrapped his arms around her slender waist, dragging her even closer. The kiss got hot so quickly they were gasping for breath but unable to surrender each other\u2019s mouths.</p><p>\u201cGod, I could eat you alive,\u201d he rasped, lifting his lips from hers and sweeping them down over the graceful column of her throat, over her delicate chin, until they once again landed, with searing intensity, on her open and gasping mouth. His hands moved to frame her small face, and his palms drifted down her cheeks until his thumbs brushed the underside of her jaw, where they exerted enough pressure to tilt her head back even farther in order to accommodate him more fully. His tongue swept into her mouth, and they both shuddered at the invasion. Her delicate hands molded over the strong, sculpted contours of his torso and up over his pectorals until her fingers unintentionally brushed over the small, flat male nipples, which were hard as pebbles beneath the thin material of his shirt. He hissed at the sensation, and she teasingly moved her hands away from the highly sensitive area.</p><p>\u201cTouch me like that again.\u201d He lifted his lips only long enough to issue the rough command, and Bronwyn moved her fluttering fingers back up and over his chest, kneading and exploring hungrily along the way, until she reached her goal. She copied a move from his playbook and gently flicked the tiny nubs with her thumbs until he groaned against her lips. She was fully committed to the kiss, enjoying the musky taste of his mouth and the unbearably erotic sensation of the rasp of his tongue over hers. Her skin burned at every point of contact, but she still couldn\u2019t get close enough to him. It had just been so long since they had been together like this.</p><p>He cupped her firm behind through the denim of her jeans and hefted her up. She happily took the hint and wrapped her long legs around his waist. She kept her mouth glued to his, even while he stumbled his way into the living room and nearly dropped her in the process. He got only far enough inside to turn and brace her against a wall.</p> <p>\u201cSweetheart, I\u2019m so hard for you,\u201d he whispered. The words were completely redundant since she couldn\u2019t miss the solid ridge of his masculinity pushing up against her through the thick denim of their jeans. He shifted her until her own hot core was rubbing up against that delicious length of flesh that she could feel throbbing despite the layers of clothing between them. She wriggled and ignored his groan as she tried to lower her legs, wanting to stand. Thankfully he seemed to know exactly what she wanted, and he stepped back to allow her down. Free to do what she was aching to do, Bronwyn clumsily unbuttoned the fly of his jeans. No easy task when he was pushing up against the unyielding material and leaving her with little room to maneuver. She succeeded at her task and his rigid penis spilled into her waiting hands. She gripped him tightly and stroked him in a way designed to drive him a little crazy. He groaned, fighting to maintain his composure and kissed her gently, his velvet-soft lips firm while his tongue forged its way into her mouth. Bronwyn was helpless to do anything but open for him, and she gasped when his hot tongue immediately sought and coaxed a response from hers. Her grip tightened around him and the sound that emerged from his throat was so anguished that for a second she thought she might have hurt him. He lifted his head and stared down at her intensely. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI love what you\u2019re doing, Bron, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll last much longer if you continue doing it,\u201d he warned. Bronwyn sighed and reluctantly released her prize after one last, lingering stroke that very nearly undid him if his reaction was anything to go by. It took a few moments of gasping and muttered curses before he opened his eyes again to scowl down at her feverishly.</p><p>\u201cYou drive me crazy,\u201d he said shakily before claiming her lips in a kiss that was the polar opposite of the gentle one he had given her before. It was hot, possessive, and downright raunchy.</p><p>Her hands fluttered aimlessly for a few seconds before reaching up to bury themselves in his luxurious hair. She arched up against him and he muttered something unintelligible into her mouth before releasing her face. In a move so fast it had her head spinning, he swung her up into his arms and strode toward the living room sofa.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, babe,\u201d his voice was strained as he placed her on the soft sofa, kneeling on the floor beside her. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can make it up to the bedroom. Are you sure you want this?\u201d She rolled her eyes at his ridiculous question and pulled him back toward her. He made a half-laughing, half-groaning sound as he claimed her lips again, smothering her own happy little giggle. She had the softness of the sofa against her back and the hardness of Bryce plastered against her front. He made no attempt to hide his obvious arousal from her as he climbed onto the sofa with her and unabashedly settled between her spread-eagled thighs before grinding himself up against her hot center.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed this,\u201d he confessed, relinquishing her lips again. \u201cI\u2019ve missed us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d she admitted, losing herself in his burning gaze.</p><p>\u201cGorgeous,\u201d he ground out thickly, reaching for the hem of her plain T-shirt and tugging it up and off her in seconds. Bryce stared down at her small breasts with such burning intensity that she knew she was blushing from head to foot.</p><p>\u201cPretty,\u201d he grunted, his voice so thick she could barely make out the word. One strong forefinger traced the delicate, scalloped edge of her shell-pink demi bra, and she sucked in a breath when the tip of his finger came within a hairsbreadth of the hard little peak of her breast. His other forefinger echoed the movement on her neglected breast, and she moaned huskily, arching herself up in the hopes that he\u2019d touch her the way she needed to be touched. He smiled in response before placing the flat of one hand on her chest, between her breasts, and gently pushing her back down.</p><p>\u201cNo rush, babe . . . relax.\u201d He barely got the words out before dropping his lips on her mouth again for another fiery kiss. Bronwyn inhaled sharply, breathing in the delicious smell of him, before wrapping her slender arms around his back and digging her fingernails into his hard muscles.</p><p>He lifted his head and trailed his mouth down over her chin, down her delicate neck, down down down to her chest, until they reached the barely there slope of one breast. His lips traced the same lacy edge his finger had explored moments before, and Bronwyn shuddered when she felt his hot moist breath against her overstimulated nipple.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she whimpered. \u201cPleasepleasepleaseplease . . .\u201d</p><p>His mouth descended onto the tight, aching nub through the satiny material, sucking so hard that the pleasure bordered on pain. Before the sensation became too uncomfortable, he eased off, regretfully dropping the softest of farewell kisses onto the delicious little morsel before moving over and gracing her neglected breast with the same treatment.</p><p>He sat up abruptly, kneeling between her widespread thighs, looking primal and fierce with his hair mussed, a flush highlighting his harsh cheekbones and his jeans unsnapped at the waist. She hungrily drank in the sight of the hard pillar of flesh relentlessly pushing up from the open fly of his jeans before shifting her gaze back up to his eyes. He was doing a bit of visual devouring of his own\u2014dragging his ravenous gaze up and down her half-naked body with an intensity that made her quiver in response.</p><p>He dragged his shirt up over his head, not even bothering with the buttons, and tossed it aside. Bronwyn nearly moaned out loud at the sight of his well-developed upper body. Her hands helplessly reached up to trace his well-defined pecs and abs, and she watched in intoxicated fascination when his muscles bunched and leaped beneath her wandering hands. She already knew his body so well but still felt like she was seeing and discovering him for the very first time. She sat up too and hungrily sucked and licked the salty, smooth skin of his chest until he groaned painfully.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so . . .\u201d The rest of his words were muffled against the skin of her neck, which he dragged into his mouth hungrily before moving back up to her mouth like it was some irresistible lure that he could not stay away from. His hands found the clasp of the bra at her back, and she felt the garment loosen but remain sandwiched between their bodies. She moved far enough away from him to yank the offending scrap of satin and lace away, plastering her naked skin back up against his hot, smooth chest. He hissed at the feel of her against him and dragged his head up to gaze down at her pouting little breasts in unabashed hunger. They were both kneeling on the large sofa now, both topless and dressed only in their jeans. Bryce cupped her breasts and tested their slight weight in the palms of his hands before his thumbs descended onto the hot coals of her raspberry-red nipples, flicking and teasing at them while she arched her back in an effort to get them into his mouth. Not one to turn down such a very delicious invitation, Bryce complied with her unspoken demand and dragged first one sweet little nub into his mouth, and then the other. The sensation was so overwhelming that it stole the breath from her body and left the scream of ecstasy she\u2019d been about to utter lodged in her throat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSensitive,\u201d he grunted unnecessarily, his voice filled with primal satisfaction. He barely lifted his mouth from its delicious task to utter that guttural observation before dipping back down to where the creamy, berry-tipped treats awaited him. He had one strong, large hand braced firmly against the small of her narrow back. His other hand was working at the snap of her jeans, and before she knew it, he\u2019d deftly pushed the stiff denim far enough down past her narrow hips to allow his eager fingers room to delve between her slender thighs, where they cupped the dripping-wet band of satiny material at her core.</p><p>Bronwyn ground herself up against his hand while Bryce, a consummate multitasker, still had his mouth on her overwhelmingly sensitive breasts. His fingers were burrowing beneath the line of her panties, and one very talented digit immediately found its way to the little knot of nerve endings at the junction of her thighs. He strummed her delicately for a few seconds, and Bronwyn convulsed violently, a strangled cry of crippling pleasure tearing from her throat. Recognizing that she was on the verge, Bryce replaced the finger with his long thumb and found the tight, wet entrance to her body, which he breeched with a gentle, yet assertive, thrust.</p><p>The combination of his thumb on her clitoris, his long finger lodged firmly inside of her, and his mouth tugging insistently at an aching nipple sent Bronwyn tumbling over the edge of insanity, and the scream ratcheted even higher as her back arched even more while her hips thrust frantically at his hand.</p><p>Her hands were digging into his broad shoulders, and Bryce stared down into her face, drinking in the sight of her prolonged orgasm like a man dying of thirst. After what seemed like an eternity, Bronwyn stopped convulsing against him and her cry faded into breathless little sobs as she melted against him. He gently allowed her limp body to slide down onto the sofa, where she lay staring up at him with wet eyes and a look of utter, shocked devastation on her face. He smiled tenderly, dropping a kiss onto her gasping lips before tugging her jeans and skimpy pink bikini briefs down her languid, unresponsive legs. He made a frustrated noise when the clothing snagged at her ankles but managed to prevail before tossing them aside triumphantly.</p><p>\u201cLove me, sweetheart?\u201d he asked roughly, and she smiled contentedly up into his sweaty face.</p><p>\u201cMore than you can possibly imagine,\u201d she mouthed, and he grinned happily.</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019m going to make love with you now,\u201d he proclaimed intently, and she swallowed a giggle at the solemn announcement. He looked so serious.</p><p>\u201cWell then, stop talking about it and get on with it,\u201d she said, still fighting for her breath after her massive climax. He growled at the challenge and tugged a condom from the back pocket of his jeans before impatiently shoving them down to his knees and dropping down between her spread thighs. Bronwyn, who was starting to feel halfway normal after the emotional and physical wreckage of her overwhelming orgasm, stared up at him when his face appeared in her line of vision. The ruddy color along his stark cheekbones had intensified, his eyes looked feverish and desperate, and his hair fell down to frame his face in a wild mane. She had never seen him look more intense and focused. She raised her heavy head and looked down to where he was poised like a battering ram between her legs. She could see the head of his shaft above her feminine mound, and she felt the rest of the hard column sawing up against her cleft. An instant later and her head fell back with a moan when the intense sensations surged to life again.</p><p>The friction was driving her crazy, and she could see by the way his face tightened that it had a similar effect on the gorgeous man braced above her. Her hands moved up to his face, where she traced his lips, then his cheekbones, with wondering fingers, and he groaned helplessly. She watched as he leaned back and fumbled while putting the condom on.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart,\u201d he growled after he had taken care of their protection. His eyes were boring into hers intensely. \u201cI want you to reach down between your legs and take me in your hand.\u201d She was happy to obey him, reaching down and grabbing hold of him in one of her eager hands. Her fingers could barely close around his girth.</p><p>\u201cPut it inside,\u201d he commanded roughly, and she inhaled a shuddering breath before obediently positioning him. She moved her hips a little and hissed when the broad head slipped inside. His brow was furrowed in concentration and his eyes closed in ecstasy as he very carefully inched even farther ahead. Bronwyn groaned at the achingly familiar feel of him.</p><p>\u201cGod, this is amazing,\u201d he groaned as he sheathed himself even farther. His eyes shut involuntarily. He hissed painfully when she thrust up against him. \u201cNo, babe. Please don\u2019t move. I can barely keep it together, Bron. If you move . . .\u201d He gulped in a breath and released it slowly before moving a little farther. Bronwyn, loving the incredible feeling of fullness, helplessly contracted around him, and he breathed a little prayer as he paused again.</p><p>\u201cSo long,\u201d he moaned, almost incoherently. \u201cIt\u2019s been so long but I want this to last.\u201d She moved her hands up to his face and angled his head until he opened his eyes to look at her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she said as clearly as she could. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be slow this time.\u201d He kissed her with hungry gratitude before boldly surging forward. Bronwyn raised her knees to his hips as she pushed herself up to meet his thrusts. One of his hands slid down over her naked thigh to hook beneath her knee and raise her leg a little higher. The slight change in angle had him hitting her spot with every urgent thrust and it drove her wild. She was beyond thinking about anything but this moment, this man, and his masterful ability to turn her into a ruined, incoherent mess in mere moments. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her arms snaked around his neck as she held on for dear life while he hammered into her. His lips were nibbling at her ear, his breathing was hot, labored, and liberally interspersed with groans as he lost himself in her. Bronwyn matched his thrusts with her own, and as she found herself hurtling toward another powerful climax, she arched her back and tangled her fingers in his hair.</p><p>\u201cBryce . . .\u201d Her voice broke on his name, and her breath caught as she felt herself clamping around his hardness. In that incredible moment, she completely forgot that he couldn\u2019t hear her. \u201cI\u2019m coming . . .\u201d He increased his tempo when he felt her tightening, not needing to hear her in order to recognize the familiar signs of her impending orgasm. Bronwyn went as taut as a bowstring, right on the verge . . .</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, my love,\u201d he encouraged breathlessly. \u201cCome for me.\u201d He drew himself nearly all the way out, until nothing but a whisper of him remained inside of her and she sobbed in frustration, before he plunged back in, angling himself to hit her just right. That was all it took to send her screaming down into the abyss. The intense contractions of her climax were enough to send Bryce plummeting down after her with a cry of pleasure. He moved his hand from the crook of her knee and flattened it against her back to pull her as close to him as she could get, while he shuddered inside of her for what seemed like forever. Afterward, they both went completely limp, occasionally jerking as pleasurable aftershocks hit them. They remained that way for a moment, still joined together and too drained to move. Bryce was planting idle little kisses on her damp neck, and Bronwyn was stroking his sweat-soaked hair.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re breathtaking,\u201d he murmured into her ear before stirring himself long enough to move off her and remove the condom. She groaned in protest when he left her briefly to dispose of it in the downstairs bathroom, kicking off his jeans and underwear in the process. He was back in seconds and stood grinning down at her nude body in immense satisfaction.</p> <p>\u201cSated, sweaty, and ever-so-slightly smug,\u201d he informed her. \u201cThat\u2019s how you look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how I feel,\u201d she confirmed lazily, lifting her arms toward him. \u201cWhy are you standing there? Come down here. I\u2019m cold, I need you to keep me warm.\u201d He smiled tenderly and entwined his fingers with hers before tugging gently at her hands.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s head up to bed,\u201d he suggested, and she pulled a sulky face.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to move,\u201d she pouted, and he chuckled before releasing her hands to swoop down and deftly scoop her up. Bronwyn squealed and looped her arms around his neck when she felt herself slipping. He tightened his hold on her and clutched her possessively close to his chest. Bronwyn nestled her face in his neck and nuzzled his warm, delicious-smelling skin contentedly.</p><p>When he reached the bedroom, he gently deposited her on their huge king-size bed, dropping down to join her. He immediately reached for her again, seemingly unwilling to relinquish his hold on her for very long. Bronwyn loved snuggling up against his big, hard body; it always made her feel protected. They did nothing more than stroke and pet, still sated after their shattering bout of lovemaking.</p> <p>\u201cBronwyn, I can\u2019t promise not to make mistakes, and I probably will inadvertently wind up doing stupid things that may hurt you in the future. I\u2019m not perfect. I\u2019m just a man and as flawed\u2014more so\u2014than any other man. But I can promise to love you with the entirety of my heart, protect you with all the strength in my body, cherish you with my mind and soul for the rest of my life and probably beyond that,\u201d he vowed. Bronwyn\u2019s cheek was pressed to his chest, and she couldn\u2019t see his face, but his voice was husky and trembling with the intensity of his emotions and the veracity of his words. \u201cI adore our daughter and with you by my side, I\u2019ll be the best father I can be. If we should be blessed with other children, I\u2019ll adore them too.\u201d</p><p>Bronwyn raised her head from its resting place close to his heart and smiled up at him soggily. She adjusted her position sinuously until she was straddling his hips, with her hands braced against his chest.</p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d she reaffirmed. \u201cFlaws and all, Bryce. The only person who ever demanded perfection from you was you. You\u2019re not perfect, but you\u2019re perfect for me. I\u2019ll cherish and protect your heart today, tomorrow, and forever.\u201d He reached up to cup her face with gentle hands, tugging her down for a fierce kiss.</p><p>\u201cForever?\u201d he asked shakily after releasing her lips. She smiled again before tracing an x across his heart and then dropping her head to kiss the spot she had just marked.</p><p>\u201cYes. Forever.\u201d</p><p>Bryce\u2019s broad chest heaved in a shuddering sigh of contentment before he dragged her down to snuggle against his chest. Bronwyn burrowed against him and smiled drowsily when she felt him stroking her hair languidly. They were silent for a few long moments and Bronwyn was on the verge of dozing off when she heard his voice. It was quiet but filled with the awe of a man who was just now recognizing a completely unfamiliar emotion.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m happy.\u201d</p><p>That was all anyone could ever ask for.</p><p>EPILOGUE</p><p>You\u2019re what?\u201d Bryce stared blankly into Bronwyn\u2019s beaming face. They were in his study, and she had seated herself in the chair opposite his desk.</p><p>\u201cPregnant,\u201d she enunciated and signed the word, but he still blinked stupidly for a few moments. Her chest heaved in a clearly exasperated sigh before she got up, rounded his desk to shout it directly into his ear. \u201cPREGNANT!\u201d</p><p>He jumped as his hearing aid squealed. He now had only 45-decibel hearing loss in his right ear after finally deciding to try that operation the year before. He still couldn\u2019t follow conversations very well unless the speaker was sitting close to him, positioned on his right side, and his hearing aid was on. The operation hadn\u2019t really changed his life much\u2014except that his wife and daughter now sometimes felt the need to shout things directly into his ear when they felt he wasn\u2019t paying close enough attention to them. He had only done it to hear Kayla\u2019s laughter, and when he\u2019d heard it for the first time, he had been gratified to learn that she did have her mother\u2019s laugh after all. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re pregnant?\u201d he said on a slow exhalation of breath, and Bronwyn nodded down at him with a grin. He felt his own lips stretching into a matching grin. They had suspected that she might be even though they\u2019d only recently decided to try for a second child. Bronwyn had just taken on a partner at her veterinary clinic, precisely for this purpose, and Kayla had just started her second year at school. Their dramatic daughter had recently been making smart-arsed comments about not wanting to be an only child for the rest of her life. Especially since her cousin Rhys had recently acquired a baby sister and even little Lily De Lucci\u2014whom Kayla seemed to consider both rival and friend\u2014was a big sister twice over thanks to the twin girls her mother had given birth to a few years before. Hating to be left out of anything, Kayla had placed an order for a little brother because neither Rhys nor Lily had one.</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d Bryce leaped to his feet and swung Bronwyn up into a hug. \u201cThat\u2019s fantastic news, sweetheart.\u201d He dropped her back onto her feet and gave her a quick, concerned once-over. \u201cWhat did the doctor say? Is everything okay?\u201d he asked worriedly.</p><p>I\u2019m healthy as a horse. Baby\u2019s due in about seven months\u2019 time. Just before Christmas.</p><p>\u201cYou always know just what to get us for Christmas,\u201d he teased.</p> <p>\u201cI try my best.\u201d She shrugged modestly.</p><p>God, he loved her so much. They had remarried nearly five years ago, less than a month after his proposal. Their marriage, even now, was filled with surprise after surprise. He wanted to create amazing memories with spontaneous trips to Europe when she wasn\u2019t busy with work, hot-air-balloon rides, flowers, jewelry, and toys for Kayla. And even more disastrous romantic meals that he had cooked himself. In the interests of self-preservation, Bronwyn had enrolled him in a Cordon Bleu cooking course. He\u2019d had minimal success in the class. Now, instead of merely burning steaks, he burned things like glazed duck and stuffed pheasant. He pretended not to notice his wife and daughter\u2019s exchanged grimaces when they knew that he would be cooking dinner. He was damned determined to conquer the cooking thing. He couldn\u2019t imagine not succeeding at it . . . okay, so it was taking him a little longer than he\u2019d anticipated\u2014years really\u2014but he knew that he could do it.</p><p>Bryce absolutely doted on his \u201cgirls\u201d and loved spoiling them, and Bronwyn had stopped protesting at the extravagance when she had seen how much pleasure he got out of his surprises. He couldn\u2019t imagine his life without them and was grateful every day for the miracle that had been granted to an undeserving man like him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re amazing,\u201d he murmured, sitting back down behind his desk and dragging her into his lap. He was well on his way to showing her just how amazing he thought she was when the study door was flung open unceremoniously, and their daughter dashed into the room. Oliver, their excitable and yappy little red miniature pinscher, followed her into the room. Kayla was still wearing her school uniform, and her braid was an unraveling mess that created a halo of escaped hair around her gamine little face.</p><p>\u201cGuess what?\u201d she asked breathlessly, so used to seeing her parents snuggling that she didn\u2019t even pause on her way to his desk.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Bronwyn asked with a grin.</p><p>\u201cMs. Williams gave me two gold stars today!\u201d the little girl boasted, practically bouncing up and down in excitement.</p><p>\u201cShe did?\u201d Bronwyn smiled, signing at the same time so that Bryce could follow the conversation.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fantastic, munchkin,\u201d Bryce said. He had his head on Bronwyn\u2019s shoulder and one hand protectively tucked against her flat stomach. \u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>I got ten out of ten for my spelling and for my math, she signed a mile a minute, her little hands practically a blur.</p><p>\u201cWow, I think that calls for a celebration, don\u2019t you?\u201d he asked them indulgently, and Bronwyn nodded, knowing that he meant to celebrate more than Kayla\u2019s gold stars. Naturally they wouldn\u2019t tell Kayla about the baby for a while. She would be an unholy, impatient little terror if she found out and then had to wait months before the baby was born.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s definitely cause for celebration,\u201d Bronwyn agreed with a smile. \u201cKayla, go and have a bath and put on your prettiest dress, we\u2019re going out to dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Her beautiful blue eyes shone with pride and her parents nodded. She squealed in excitement and careened back out of the room with Oliver racing out after her.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Bryce whispered quietly, and Bronwyn craned her neck to meet his eyes.</p><p>\u201cFor?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cEverything,\u201d he said expansively before elaborating. \u201cFor the small, everyday things and the huge, life-altering things.\u201d His eyes went misty, and he blinked in embarrassment. When he was able to see her face clearly again, she was smiling luminously. He watched her hands and her face as they spelled out her inevitable response, the one that never failed to bring a lump to his throat and tears to his eyes.</p><p>There\u2019s the man I married. </p> </body></html>"]
