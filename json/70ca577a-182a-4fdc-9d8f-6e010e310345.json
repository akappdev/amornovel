Les has reminded me more than once that it\u2019s not my business. She\u2019s never been a brother before, though. She has no idea how hard it is to sit back and not let it be my business. That\u2019s why, right now, this son-of-a-bitch is my number-one priority.</p><p>I slide my hands into the back pockets of my jeans and hope to hell I can keep them there. I\u2019m standing behind the couch, looking down at him. I don\u2019t know how long it\u2019ll take him to notice I\u2019m here. Considering the grip he has on the chick straddling his lap, I doubt he\u2019ll notice for a while. I remain behind them for several minutes while the party continues around us, everyone completely unaware that I\u2019m a fraction away from losing my mind. I would take out my phone so that I\u2019d have evidence, but I couldn\u2019t do that to Les. She doesn\u2019t need a visual.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I finally say, unable to contain my silence a second longer. If I have to watch him palm this chick\u2019s breast one more time without a single ounce of respect for his relationship with Les, I\u2019ll rip his fucking hand off.</p> <p>Grayson tears his mouth away from hers and tilts his head back, looking up at me with glossed-over eyes. I can see the fear settle in when it clicks\u2014when he finally realizes that the last person he thought would be here tonight actually showed up.</p><p>\u201cHolder,\u201d he says, pushing the girl off his lap. He struggles to his feet but can hardly stand up straight. He looks at me pleadingly, pointing at the girl, who\u2019s now adjusting her barely-there skirt. \u201cThis isn\u2019t . . . it\u2019s not what it looks like.\u201d</p><p>I slide my hands out of my back pockets and fold my arms across my chest. My fist is closer to him now and I have to clench it, knowing how good it would feel to punch his face in.</p><p>I look down to the floor and inhale a breath. Then another. And one more just for show, since I\u2019m really enjoying watching him squirm. I shake my head and raise my eyes back to his. \u201cGive me your phone.\u201d</p><p>The confusion on his face would be comical if I weren\u2019t so pissed. He laughs and attempts to back up a step, but bumps into the coffee table. He catches himself by pressing his hand onto the glass and straightens back up. \u201cGet your own fucking phone,\u201d he mumbles. He doesn\u2019t look back at me as he maneuvers his way around the coffee table. I calmly walk around the couch and intercept him, holding out my hand.</p> <p>\u201cGive me your phone, Grayson. Now.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not really at an advantage sizewise, since we\u2019re about the same build. However, I\u2019m definitely at an advantage if you take my anger into consideration, and Grayson can clearly see that. He takes a step back, which probably isn\u2019t a very smart move considering he\u2019s backing himself straight into the corner of the living room. He fumbles with his pocket and finally pulls out his phone.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you want my phone for?\u201d he says. I grab it out of his hands and dial Les\u2019s number without hitting send. I hand it back to him.</p><p>\u201cCall her. Tell her what a bastard you are and end it.\u201d</p><p>Grayson looks down at his phone, then back up at me. \u201cGo fuck yourself,\u201d he spits.</p><p>I inhale a calming breath, then roll my neck and pop my jaw. When that doesn\u2019t help ease my urge to make him bleed, I reach forward, grab the collar of his shirt and shove him hard against the wall, pinning his neck with my forearm. I remind myself that if I kick his ass before he makes the call, my remaining calm for the past ten minutes will have been pointless.</p> <p>My teeth are clenched, my jaw is tight, and my pulse is pounding in my head. I\u2019ve never hated anyone more than in this moment. The intensity of what I wish I could do to him right now is even scaring me.</p><p>I look him hard in the eyes and let him know how the next few minutes are about to play out. \u201cGrayson,\u201d I say through clenched teeth. \u201cUnless you want me to do what I really want to do to you right now, you will put the phone to your ear, you will call my sister, and you will end it. Then you\u2019re going to hang up the phone and never speak to her again.\u201d I press my arm harder against his neck, taking note of the fact that his face is now redder than his shirt, due to lack of oxygen.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he grumbles, attempting to free himself from the hold I have on him. I wait until he looks down at the phone and hits send before I release my arm and let go of his shirt. He puts the phone to his ear and never stops looking at me as we both stand still and wait for Les to answer.</p><p>I know what this will do to her, but she has no idea what he does behind her back. No matter how many times she hears it from other people, he\u2019s somehow able to weasel his way back into her life every time.</p><p>Not this time. Not if I have any control over it. I won\u2019t sit back and let him do this to my sister anymore.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he says into the phone. He tries to turn away from me to speak to her, but I shove his shoulder back against the wall. He winces.</p><p>\u201cNo, babe,\u201d he says nervously. \u201cI\u2019m at Jaxon\u2019s house.\u201d There\u2019s a long pause while he listens to her speak. \u201cI know that\u2019s what I said, but I lied. That\u2019s why I\u2019m calling. Les, I . . . I think we need some space.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, letting him know that he needs to make it an absolute break-up. I\u2019m not looking for him to give her space. I\u2019m looking for him to give my sister permanent freedom.</p> <p>He rolls his eyes and flips me off with his free hand. \u201cI\u2019m breaking up with you,\u201d he says flatly. He allows her to talk while he remains silent. The fact that he\u2019s showing no remorse whatsoever proves what a heartless dick he is. My hands are shaking and my chest tightens, knowing exactly what this is doing to Les right now. I hate myself for forcing this to happen, but Les deserves better, even if she doesn\u2019t think she does.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hanging up now,\u201d he says into the phone.</p><p>I shove his head back against the wall and force him to look at me. \u201cApologize to her,\u201d I say quietly, not wanting her to hear me in the background. He closes his eyes and sighs, then ducks his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Lesslie. I didn\u2019t want to do this.\u201d He pulls the phone from his ear and abruptly ends the call. He stares at the screen for several seconds. \u201cI hope you\u2019re happy,\u201d he says, looking back up at me. \u201cBecause you just broke your sister\u2019s heart.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s the last thing Grayson says to me. My fist meets his jaw twice before he hits the floor. I shake out my hand, back away from him, and make my way to the exit. Before I even reach my car, my phone is buzzing in my back pocket. I pull it out and don\u2019t even look at the screen before answering it.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I say, attempting to control the trembling anger in my voice when I hear her crying on the other end. \u201cI\u2019m on my way, Les. It\u2019ll be okay, I\u2019m on my way.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s been an entire day since Grayson made the call, but I still feel guilty, so I tack on an extra two miles to my evening run for self-inflicted punishment. Seeing Les torn up like she was last night wasn\u2019t something I had expected. I realize now that having him call her like I did probably wasn\u2019t the best way of handling things, but there\u2019s no way I could just sit back and allow him to dick around on her like he was.</p><p>The most unexpected thing about Les\u2019s reaction was that her anger wasn\u2019t solely placed on Grayson. It was as if she was pissed at the entire male population. She kept referring to men as \u201csick bastards,\u201d pacing her bedroom floor back and forth, while I just sat there and watched her vent. She finally broke down, crawled into bed, and cried herself to sleep. I lay awake, knowing I had a hand in her heartache. I stayed in her room the whole night, partly to make sure she was okay, but mostly because I didn\u2019t want her picking up the phone and calling Grayson in a moment of desperation.</p><p>She\u2019s stronger than I give her credit for, though. She didn\u2019t attempt to call him last night and she\u2019s made no attempt to call him today. She didn\u2019t get much sleep last night, so she went to her room before lunch to nap. However, I\u2019ve been pausing outside her bedroom door throughout the day just to make sure I couldn\u2019t hear her on the phone, so I know she hasn\u2019t made any attempts to call him. At least while I\u2019ve been home. In fact, I\u2019m pretty sure the heartless phone call from him last night was exactly what she needed to finally see him for who he really is.</p><p>I kick my shoes off at the door and walk to the kitchen to refill my water. It\u2019s Saturday night and I would normally be heading out with Daniel, but I already texted him to let him know I was staying in tonight. Les made me promise I would stay in with her because she didn\u2019t want to go out and chance running into Grayson yet. She\u2019s lucky she\u2019s cool, because I don\u2019t know many seventeen-year-old guys who would give up a Saturday night to watch chick flicks with his heartbroken sister. But then again, most siblings don\u2019t have what Les and I have. I don\u2019t know if our close relationship has anything to do with the fact that we\u2019re twins. She\u2019s my only sibling, so I don\u2019t have anything to compare us to. She might argue that I\u2019m too protective of her, and there may be some truth to that argument, but I don\u2019t plan on changing anytime soon. Or ever.</p><p>I run up the stairs, pull my shirt off, and push open the bathroom door. I turn the water on, then walk across the hall and knock on her bedroom door. \u201cI\u2019m taking a quick shower, will you order the pizza?\u201d</p><p>I brace my hand against her door and reach down to pull my socks off. I turn around and toss them into the bathroom, then beat on her door again. \u201cLes!\u201d</p><p>When she doesn\u2019t respond, I sigh and look up at the ceiling. If she\u2019s on the phone with him, I\u2019ll be pissed. But if she\u2019s on the phone with him, it probably means he\u2019s telling her the break-up was all my fault and she\u2019ll be the one who\u2019s pissed. I wipe my palms on my shorts and open the door to her bedroom, preparing for another heated lecture on how I need to mind my own business.</p><p>I see Les on her bed after I walk into her room, and I\u2019m immediately taken back to when I was a little boy. Back to the moment that changed me. Everything about me. Everything about the world around me. My whole world turned from a place full of vibrant colors to a dull, lifeless gray. The sky, the grass, the trees . . . all the things that were once beautiful were stripped of their magnificence the moment I realized I was responsible for our best friend Hope\u2019s disappearance.</p><p>I never looked at people the same way. I never looked at nature the same way. I never looked at my future the same way. Everything went from having a meaning, a purpose, and a reason, to simply being a second-rate version of what life was supposed to be like. My once effervescent world was suddenly a blurred, gray, colorless photocopy.</p><p>Just like Les\u2019s eyes.</p><p>They aren\u2019t hers. They\u2019re open. They\u2019re looking right at me from her position on the bed.</p><p>But they aren\u2019t hers.</p><p>The color in her eyes is gone. This girl is a gray, colorless photocopy of my sister.</p><p>My Les.</p><p>I can\u2019t move. I wait for her to blink, to laugh, to revel in the twisted aftermath of the sick, fucking joke she\u2019s playing right now. I wait for my heart to start beating again, for my lungs to start working again. I wait for control of my body to return to me because I don\u2019t know who has control of it right now. I sure as hell don\u2019t. I wait and I wait and I wonder how long she can keep this up. How long can people keep their eyes open like that? How long can people not breathe before their body jerks for that desperately needed gasp of air? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>How fucking long before I do something to help her?</p><p>My hands are touching her face, grabbing her arm, shaking her whole body until she\u2019s in my arms and I\u2019m pulling her onto my lap. The empty pill bottle falls out of her hand and lands on the floor but I refuse to look at it. Her eyes are still lifeless and she\u2019s no longer looking at me as the head between my hands falls backward every time I try to lift it up.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t flinch when I scream her name, and she doesn\u2019t wince when I slap her, and she doesn\u2019t react when I start to cry.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t do a goddamned thing.</p> <p>She doesn\u2019t even tell me it\u2019ll be okay when every single ounce of whatever was left inside my chest is propelled out of me the moment I realize that the very best part of me is dead.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>\u201cWill you look for her pink top and the black pleated pants?\u201d my mother asks. She keeps her eyes trained on the paperwork laid out in front of her. The man from the funeral home reaches across the table and points to a spot on the form.</p><p>\u201cJust a few more pages, Beth,\u201d he says. My mother mechanically signs the forms without question. She\u2019s trying to keep it together until they leave, but I know as soon as they walk out the front door she\u2019ll break down again. It\u2019s only been forty-eight hours, but I can tell just by looking at her that she\u2019s about to experience it all over again.</p><p>You would think a person could only die once. You would think you would only find your sister\u2019s lifeless body once. You would think you would only have to watch your mother\u2019s reaction once after finding out her only daughter is dead.</p> <p>Once is so far from accurate.</p><p>It happens repeatedly.</p><p>Every single time I close my eyes I see Les\u2019s eyes. Every time my mother looks at me, she\u2019s watching me tell her that her daughter is dead for the second time. For the third time. For the thousandth time. Every time I take a breath or blink or speak, I experience her death all over again. I don\u2019t sit here and wonder if the fact that she\u2019s dead will ever sink in. I sit here and wonder when I\u2019ll stop having to watch her die.</p><p>\u201cHolder, they need an outfit for her,\u201d my mother repeats again after noticing I haven\u2019t moved. \u201cGo to her room and get the pink shirt with the long sleeves. It\u2019s her favorite one, she\u2019d want to wear it.\u201d</p><p>She knows I don\u2019t want to go into Les\u2019s bedroom any more than she does. I push my chair away from the table and head upstairs. \u201cLes is dead,\u201d I mutter to myself. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t give a shit what she\u2019s wearing.\u201d</p><p>I pause outside her door, knowing I\u2019ll have to watch her die all over again the moment I open it. I haven\u2019t been in here since I found her and I really had no intention of ever coming back in here.</p> <p>I walk inside and shut the door behind me, then make my way to her closet. I do my best not to think about it.</p><p>Pink shirt.</p><p>Don\u2019t think about her.</p><p>Long sleeves.</p><p>Don\u2019t think about how you would do anything to go back to Saturday night.</p><p>Pleated black pants.</p><p>Don\u2019t think about how much you fucking hate yourself right now for letting her down.</p><p>But I do. I think about it and I become hurt and angry all over again. I grab a fistful of shirts hanging in the closet and rip them as hard as I can off their hangers until they fall to the closet floor. I grip the frame on top of the door and squeeze my eyes shut, listening to the sound of the now empty hangers swinging back and forth. I try to focus on the fact that I\u2019m in here to grab two things and leave, but I can\u2019t move. I can\u2019t stop replaying the moment that I walked into this bedroom and found her.</p> <p>I fall to my knees on the floor, look over at her bed, and watch her die one more time.</p><p>I sit back against the closet door and close my eyes, remaining in this position for however long it takes me to realize that I don\u2019t want to be in here. I turn around and rummage through the shirts that are now on the closet floor until I find the long-sleeved pink one. I look up at the pants hanging from their hangers and I grab a pair of black pleated ones. I toss them to the side and begin to push up from the floor, but immediately sit back down when I see a thick, leather-bound notebook on the bottom shelf of her closet.</p><p>I grab it and pull it onto my lap, then lean back against the wall and stare at the cover. I\u2019ve seen this notebook before. It was a gift to her from Dad about three years ago, but Les told me she\u2019d never use it because she knew the notebook was just a request made by her therapist. Les hated therapy, and I was never sure why Mom encouraged her to go. We both went for a while after Mom and Dad split up, but I stopped attending the sessions once they started interfering with junior high football practice. Mom didn\u2019t seem to mind that I didn\u2019t go, but Les continued with the weekly sessions up until two days ago . . . when her actions made it clear the therapy wasn\u2019t exactly helping.</p><p>I flip the notebook open to the first page and it doesn\u2019t surprise me that it\u2019s blank. I wonder, if she had used the notebook like the therapist suggested, would it have made a difference?</p><p>I doubt it. I don\u2019t know what could have saved Les from herself. Certainly not a pen and paper.</p><p>I pull the pen out of the spiral binding, then press the tip of the pen to the paper and begin to write her a letter. I don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m writing her. I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s in a place where she can see me right now, or if she\u2019s even in a place at all, but in case she can see this . . . I want her to know how her selfish decision affected me. How hopeless she left me. Literally hopeless. And completely alone. And so, so incredibly sorry.</p><p>Chapter Two-and-a-half</p><p>Les,</p><p>You left your jeans in the middle of your bedroom floor. It looks like you just stepped out of them. It\u2019s weird. Why would you leave your jeans on the floor if you knew what you were about to do? Wouldn\u2019t you at least throw them in the hamper? Did you not think about what would happen after I found you and how someone would eventually have to pick your jeans up and do something with them? Well, I\u2019m not picking them up. And I\u2019m not hanging all your shirts back up, either.</p><p>Anyway. I\u2019m in your closet. On the floor. I just don\u2019t really know what I want to say to you right now, or what I want to ask you. Of course the only question on everyone else\u2019s mind right now is \u201cWhy did she do it?\u201d But I\u2019m not going to ask you why you did it for two reasons.</p><p>1) You can\u2019t answer me. You\u2019re dead.</p><p>2) I don\u2019t know if I really care why you did it. There isn\u2019t anything about your life that would give you a good enough reason to do what you did. And you probably already know that if you can see Mom right now. She\u2019s completely devastated.</p><p>You know, I never really knew what it meant to actually be devastated. I thought we were devastated after we lost Hope. What happened to her was definitely tragic for us, but the way we felt was nothing compared to how you\u2019ve made Mom feel. She\u2019s so incredibly devastated; she gives the word a whole new meaning. I wish the use of the word could be restricted to situations like this. It\u2019s absurd that people are allowed to use it to describe anything other than how a mother feels when she loses her child. Because that\u2019s the only situation in this entire world worthy of the term.</p><p>Dammit, I miss you so much. I\u2019m so sorry I let you down. I\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t able to see what was really going on behind your eyes every time you told me you were fine.</p><p>So, yeah. Why, Les? Why did you do it?</p><p>Chapter Two-and-three-quarters</p><p>Les,</p><p>Well, congratulations. You\u2019re pretty popular. Not only did you fill the parking lot of the funeral home with cars, but you also filled the lot next door and both churches down the street. That\u2019s a lot of cars.</p><p>I held it together, though; mostly for Mom\u2019s sake. Dad looked almost as bad as Mom. The whole funeral was really weird. It made me wonder, had you died in a car wreck or from something more mainstream, would people\u2019s reactions have been different? If you hadn\u2019t purposely overdosed (that\u2019s the term Mom prefers), then I think people might have been a little less weird. It was like they were scared of us, or maybe they thought purposely overdosing was contagious. They discussed it like we weren\u2019t even in the same room. So many stares and whispers and pitiful smiles. I just wanted to grab Mom and pull her out of there and protect her from the fact that I knew she was reliving your death with every hug and every tear and every smile.</p><p>Of course I couldn\u2019t help but think everyone was acting like they were because they blamed us in a way. I could tell what they were thinking.</p><p>How could a family not know this would happen?</p><p>How could they not see the signs?</p><p>What kind of mother is she?</p><p>What kind of brother doesn\u2019t notice how depressed his own twin sister is?</p><p>Luckily, once your funeral began, everyone\u2019s focus was momentarily taken off us and placed on the slideshow. There were a lot of pictures of you and me. You were happy in all of them. There were a lot of pictures of you and your friends, and you were happy in all of those, too. Pictures of you with Mom and Dad before the divorce; pictures of you with Mom and Brian after she remarried; pictures of you with Dad and Pamela after he remarried.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t until the very last picture came up on the screen that it hit me. It was the picture of you and me in front of our old house. The one that was taken about six months after Hope went missing? You still had the bracelet on that matched the one you gave her the day she was taken. I noticed you stopped wearing it a couple of years ago, but I\u2019ve never asked about it. I know you don\u2019t really like to talk about her.</p><p>Anyway, back to the picture. I had my arm around your neck and we were both laughing and smiling at the camera. It\u2019s the same smile you flashed in all the other pictures. It got me to thinking about how every picture I\u2019ve ever seen of you; you have that same exact, identical smile. There isn\u2019t a single picture of you with a frown on your face. Or a scowl. Or a blank expression. It\u2019s like you spent your whole life trying to keep up this false appearance. For whom, I don\u2019t know. Maybe you were scared that a camera would permanently capture an honest feeling of yours. Because let\u2019s face it, you weren\u2019t happy all the time. All those nights you cried yourself to sleep? All those nights you needed me to hold you while you cried, but you refused to tell me what was wrong? No one with a genuine smile would cry to themselves like that. And I realize you had issues, Les. I knew our life and the things that happened to us affected you differently than they did me. But how was I supposed to know that they were as serious as they were if you never let it show? If you never told me?</p><p>Maybe . . . and I hate to think this. But maybe I didn\u2019t know you. I thought I did, but I didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t think I knew you at all. I knew the girl who cried at night. I knew the girl who smiled in the pictures. But I didn\u2019t know the girl that linked that smile with those tears. I have no idea why you flashed fake smiles, but cried real tears. When a guy loves a girl, especially his sister, he\u2019s supposed to know what makes her smile and what makes her cry.</p><p>But I didn\u2019t. And I don\u2019t. So I\u2019m sorry, Les. I\u2019m so sorry I let you go on pretending that you were okay when obviously you were so far from it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Three</p><p>\u201cBeth, why don\u2019t you go to bed?\u201d Brian says to my mother. \u201cYou\u2019re exhausted. Go get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>My mother shakes her head and continues stirring, despite the pleas from my stepdad for her to take a break. We\u2019ve got enough food in the refrigerator to feed an army, yet she insists on cooking for everyone just so we don\u2019t have to eat the sympathy food, as she refers to it. I\u2019m so sick of fried chicken. It seems to be the go-to meal for anyone dropping food off at the house. I\u2019ve had fried chicken for every meal since the morning after Les died, and that was four days ago.</p><p>I walk to the stove and take the spoon out of her hands, then rub her shoulder with my free hand while I stir. She leans against me and sighs. It\u2019s not a good sigh, either. It\u2019s a sigh that all but says, \u201cI\u2019m done.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlease, go sit on the couch. I can finish this,\u201d I say to her. She nods and walks aimlessly into the living room. I watch from the kitchen as she takes a seat and leans her head back into the couch, looking up to the ceiling. Brian takes a seat next to her and pulls her to him. I don\u2019t even have to hear her to know she\u2019s crying again. I can see it in the way she slumps against him and grabs hold of his shirt.</p><p>I look away.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should come stay with us, Dean,\u201d my father says, leaning against the counter. \u201cJust for a little while. It might do you some good to get away.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s the only one who still calls me Dean. I\u2019ve been going by Holder since I was eight, but the fact that I was named after him may be why he never took to calling me anything other than Dean. I only see him a couple of times a year, so it doesn\u2019t bother me too much that he still calls me Dean. I still hate the name, though.</p><p>I look at him, then back to my mother still holding on to Brian in the living room. \u201cI can\u2019t, Dad. I\u2019m not leaving her. Especially now.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s been trying to get me to move to Austin with him since they divorced. The truth is, I like it here. I haven\u2019t liked visiting my old hometown since I moved away. Too many things remind me of Hope when I\u2019m there.</p><p>But I guess too many things are going to start reminding me of Les, here.</p><p>\u201cWell, my offer doesn\u2019t expire,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know that.\u201d</p><p>I nod and switch off the burner. \u201cIt\u2019s ready,\u201d I say.</p><p>Brian comes back to the kitchen with Pam and we all take seats at the table, but my mother remains in the living room, softly crying into the couch throughout dinner.</p><p>I\u2019m waving good-bye to my father and Pam when Amy pulls up in front of our house. She waits for my father\u2019s car to clear, then she pulls into our driveway. I walk to the driver\u2019s side door and open it for her.</p> <p>She smiles half-heartedly and flips the visor down, wiping the mascara from underneath the frame of her sunglasses. It\u2019s been dark for over an hour now, yet she\u2019s still wearing sunglasses. That can only mean she\u2019s been crying.</p><p>I haven\u2019t really talked to her much in the past four days, but I don\u2019t have to ask her how she\u2019s holding up. She and Les have been best friends for seven years. If there\u2019s anyone that feels like I do right now, it\u2019s her. And I\u2019m not even sure if I\u2019m holding up all that well.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Thomas?\u201d I ask when she steps out of the car.</p><p>She pushes her blonde hair away from her face with her sunglasses, adjusting them on top of her head. \u201cHe\u2019s at his house. He had to go help his dad with some yard stuff after school.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know how long the two of them have been dating, but they were together before Les and I even moved here. And we moved here in the fourth grade, so it\u2019s been a while.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your mom?\u201d she asks. As soon as she says it, she shakes her head apologetically. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Holder. That was a really stupid question. I promised myself I wouldn\u2019t be one of those people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, you\u2019re not,\u201d I assure her. I motion behind me. \u201cYou coming inside?\u201d</p><p>She nods and glances at the house, then to me. \u201cDo you mind if I go up to her room? It\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t want me up there yet. It\u2019s just that she had a few pictures I\u2019d really like to have.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine.\u201d Based on the relationship she had with Les, Amy has just as much right to be in Les\u2019s bedroom as I do. I know Les would want Amy to take whatever it is she wants.</p><p>She follows me into the house and up the stairs. I notice my mother isn\u2019t on the couch anymore. Brian must have finally coaxed her into going to bed. I walk to the top of the stairs with Amy, but have no desire to go into Les\u2019s room with her. I nudge my head toward my bedroom. \u201cI\u2019ll be in my room if you need me.\u201d</p><p>She inhales a deep, nervous breath and nods while releasing it. \u201cThanks,\u201d she says, eyeing Les\u2019s door warily. She takes a reluctant step toward the bedroom, so I turn away and head to my room. I shut the door behind me and take a seat on the bed, picking up Les\u2019s notebook while I lean back against my headboard. I\u2019ve already written her today, but I grab a pen because I\u2019ve got nothing better to do than write to her again. Or at least there\u2019s nothing else I want to do because it all leads back to thoughts of her anyway.</p><p>Chapter Three-and-a-half</p><p>Les,</p><p>Amy\u2019s here. She\u2019s in your room, going through your shit.</p><p>I wonder if she had any clue as to what you were about to do? I know sometimes girls share stuff with their girlfriends that they wouldn\u2019t share with anyone else\u2014even twin brothers. Did you ever tell her how you really felt? Did you give her any hints at all? I\u2019m really hoping you didn\u2019t, because that would mean she probably feels pretty damn guilty right about now. She doesn\u2019t deserve to feel guilty over what you did, Les. She\u2019s been your best friend for seven years now, so I hope to hell you thought about that before you made such a selfish decision.</p><p>I feel guilty for what you did, but I deserve to feel guilty. There\u2019s a responsibility that comes along with being a brother that doesn\u2019t necessarily come along with being a best friend. It was my job to protect you, not Amy\u2019s. So she doesn\u2019t deserve to feel guilty.</p><p>Maybe that was my problem. Maybe I spent so much time trying to protect you from Grayson that I never thought who I really needed to be protecting you from was yourself.</p><p>There\u2019s a light tap on my bedroom door, so I close the notebook and set it on the nightstand. Amy pushes open the door and I sit up on the bed. I motion for her to come in so she eases through the door and shuts it behind her. She walks over to my dresser and sets the pictures she collected down, running her finger over the top one. Tears are silently streaming down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d I say, holding a hand out to her. She walks closer to me and takes my hand, then completely breaks down the second she makes eye contact with me. I continue to pull her forward until she\u2019s on the bed and I wrap my arms around her. She curls up against my chest, sobbing uncontrollably. She\u2019s shaking so hard and it\u2019s almost a devastated cry, but like I said before, devastated should be reserved for mothers.</p><p>I close my eyes tightly and try not to let it all hit me like it\u2019s hitting Amy right now, but it\u2019s hard. I can hold it in for my mother because she needs me to be strong for her. Amy doesn\u2019t, though. If Amy feels anything like I do, then she just needs to know there\u2019s someone else out there just as blindsided and heartbroken as she is.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d I say, stroking her hair. I know she doesn\u2019t want me to console her with empty, overused words. She just needs someone to understand how she feels and I may be the only one she knows who truly does. I don\u2019t tell her to try to stop crying, because I know it\u2019s impossible. I press my cheek against her head, hating the fact that I\u2019m now crying, too. I\u2019ve done a pretty damn good job of keeping it in, but I can\u2019t anymore. I continue to hold her and she continues to hold on to me because it\u2019s nice to be able to find solace in such an ugly, lonely situation.</p><p>Listening to Amy cry reminds me of all the nights I used to be in this same position with Les. She wouldn\u2019t want me to talk to her or help her stop crying. Les just needed me to hold her and let her cry, even if I had no idea why she needed it. Just being able to be here for Amy in this same small way gives me that familiar sense of being needed like I used to feel with Les. I haven\u2019t felt needed since Les decided she didn\u2019t need anyone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Amy says, her voice muffled by my shirt.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>She catches her breath and attempts to stop crying, but her effort is wasted with the new tears that follow. \u201cI should have known, Holder. I had no idea. I was her best friend and I feel like everyone blames me and . . . I don\u2019t know. Maybe they should. I don\u2019t know. Maybe I\u2019ve been so wrapped up in my relationship with Thomas that I missed something she was trying to tell me.\u201d</p><p>I continue stroking her hair, empathizing with every word coming out of her mouth. \u201cYou and me both,\u201d I sigh. I wipe the moisture away from my eyes with the back of my hand. \u201cYou know, I keep trying to pinpoint moments that might have changed the outcome. Things I might have said to her or things she might have said to me. But even if I was able to go back and change something about the past, I\u2019m not sure that it would have changed the outcome. You don\u2019t know that, either. Les is the only one who knows for sure why she went through with it and unfortunately she\u2019s the only one not here to enlighten us.\u201d</p><p>Amy lets out a small laugh, although I\u2019m not sure why. She pulls back slightly and looks at me with a solemn expression. \u201cShe better be glad she\u2019s not here, because I\u2019m so mad at her, Holder.\u201d Her somberness gives way to another sob and she brings a hand to her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m so, so mad at her for not confiding in me and I feel like I can\u2019t say that to anyone but you,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>I move her hand away from her face and look her in the eyes because I don\u2019t want her to feel like I\u2019m judging her for that comment. \u201cDon\u2019t feel guilty, Amy. Okay?\u201d</p><p>She nods and smiles a sympathetic smile, then looks down at our hands resting on the pillow between us. I lay my hand on top of hers and smooth reassuring strokes across the top of it with my fingers. I know how she feels and she knows how I feel and it\u2019s good to have that, even if only for a moment.</p><p>I want to tell her thank you for being there for Les all these years, but it seems so inappropriate to thank her for being there when she\u2019s feeling the exact opposite right now. Instead, I remain quiet and bring my hand up to her face. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the magnitude of the moment or the fact that she made me feel somewhat needed again or if it\u2019s simply because my head and my heart have been numb for so many days. Whatever it is, it\u2019s here and I don\u2019t want it to go away yet. I just let it completely take over while I slowly lean forward and press my mouth to hers.</p><p>I didn\u2019t intend to kiss her. In fact, I expect myself to pull away any second, but I don\u2019t. I expect her to push me away, but she doesn\u2019t. The moment my mouth meets hers, she parts her lips and sighs as if this is exactly what she needs from me. Oddly enough, that makes me want to kiss her even more. I kiss her, knowing she\u2019s my sister\u2019s best friend. I kiss her, knowing she has a boyfriend. I kiss her, knowing this isn\u2019t something I would do with her under any circumstance other than in this moment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She slides her hand up my arm and slips her fingers inside the sleeve of my shirt, lightly tracing the contours of the muscles in my arm. I pull her closer to the middle of the bed with me and deepen our kiss. The more we kiss, the more we both recognize the fact that desire and need might just be the only thing that can minimize grief. We simultaneously grow more impatient, doing whatever we can to rid ourselves of the grief completely. Every stroke of her hand against my skin pulls me farther out of my own mind and more into the moment with her, so I kiss her more desperately, needing her to take my mind completely away from my life right now. My hand makes its way up her shirt and the second I cup her breast, she moans and digs her nails into my forearm, arching her back.</p><p>That\u2019s a nonverbal cue for yes if I\u2019ve ever seen one.</p><p>I\u2019ve only got two things remaining on my mind as she begins to pull off my shirt and my hands are eagerly fumbling with the zipper on her jeans.</p><p>1. I need to get these clothes off her.</p> <p>2. Thomas.</p><p>I normally don\u2019t make a habit of thinking about other guys while I\u2019m making out with girls, but I normally don\u2019t make a habit of making out with other guys\u2019 girls. Amy isn\u2019t mine to kiss, but here I am doing it anyway. Her clothes aren\u2019t mine to be helping her out of, but here I am doing it anyway. Her panties aren\u2019t something I should be slipping my hand inside of, but here I am doing it anyway.</p><p>I pull away from her mouth when I touch her and watch as she moans and presses her head back against my pillow. I keep doing what I\u2019m doing to her with one hand while I lean across the bed and pull a condom out of the drawer with my other hand. I tear it open with my teeth, watching her intently the whole time. I know that neither of us is in the right frame of mind right now or this wouldn\u2019t be happening. Regardless if we\u2019re in the right frame of mind or not, at least we\u2019re in the same frame of mind. I\u2019m hoping we are, anyway.</p><p>I know how incredibly and completely wrong it is to ask a girl about her boyfriend when she\u2019s thirty seconds away from completely forgetting all about him, but I have to. I don\u2019t want her regretting this any more than she already will. Than we both will.</p><p>\u201cAmy?\u201d I whisper. \u201cWhat about Thomas?\u201d</p> <p>She whimpers slightly and keeps her eyes closed, bringing her palms up to my chest. \u201cHe\u2019s at his house,\u201d she mutters, giving no hint that the mention of his name is making her want to stop what we\u2019re doing. \u201cHe had to go help his dad with some yard stuff after school.\u201d</p><p>Her exact repetition of the answer she gave me when I asked about him in the driveway makes me laugh. She opens her eyes and looks up at me, probably confused about why I would laugh at a time like this. She just smiles, though. I\u2019m thankful she smiled, because I\u2019m really sick of everyone\u2019s tears. I\u2019m so damn sick of all the tears.</p><p>And shit. If she doesn\u2019t feel guilty right this second, then I\u2019m sure as hell not about to feel guilty. We can regret this all we need to later.</p><p>I lower my mouth to hers at the exact moment she gasps, then moans loudly\u2014completely and wholeheartedly forgetting all about her boyfriend. Every last bit of her attention is one hundred percent focused on the movement of my hand, and every last bit of my attention is one hundred percent focused on getting this condom on before she starts thinking about her boyfriend again.</p><p>I ease myself on top of her, ease my mouth back to hers, ease myself inside her, and completely take advantage of the situation, knowing how much I\u2019ll regret it later. Knowing how much I already regret it.</p><p>But here I am, doing it anyway.</p> <p>She\u2019s dressed and sitting on the edge of my bed, putting on her shoes. I\u2019ve already got my jeans on and I\u2019m walking to the bedroom door, not sure what to say. I have no idea how or why any of that just happened, and based on the look on her face, neither does she. She stands up and walks toward the door, picking up the pictures she grabbed from Les\u2019s room as she passes by my dresser. I hold the door open, unsure if I should follow her out or kiss her good-bye or tell her I\u2019ll call her.</p><p>What the hell did I just do?</p><p>She walks into the hallway and pauses, then turns around to face me. She doesn\u2019t make eye contact, though. She just stares at the pictures in her hands. \u201cI just came for pictures, right?\u201d she asks cautiously. A worried frown consumes her face and I realize she\u2019s afraid I might think what just happened between us was more than it actually was.</p><p>I want to reassure her that I\u2019m not going to say anything. I lift her chin so that she\u2019s looking me in the eyes and I smile at her. \u201cYou came for pictures. That\u2019s it, Amy. And Thomas is at home, helping his dad with the yard work.\u201d</p><p>She laughs, if you can even call it that, then she looks at me appreciatively. There\u2019s an awkward silence for a moment before she finally laughs again. \u201cWhat the hell was that, anyway?\u201d she says, waving her hand in the direction of my bedroom. \u201cThat\u2019s not us, Holder. We\u2019re not that type of people.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re not that type of people. I agree with that. I lean my head against the doorframe and already feel the regret seeping in. I don\u2019t know what came over me or why the fact that she\u2019s not remotely mine for the taking didn\u2019t stop me in my tracks. The only excuse I can come up with is that whatever happened between us just now is a direct product of our grief. And our grief is a direct product of Les\u2019s selfish decision.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s blame it on Les,\u201d I say, only half-teasing. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have happened if she had been here.\u201d</p><p>Amy smiles. \u201cYeah,\u201d she says, squinting playfully. \u201cWhat a bitch, making us do something despicable like that. How dare she.\u201d</p> <p>I laugh. \u201cRight?\u201d</p><p>She holds up the pictures in her hand. \u201cThanks for . . .\u201d she looks at the pictures and pauses for a moment, then brings her eyes back to mine. \u201cJust . . . thank you, Holder. For listening.\u201d</p><p>I acknowledge her thanks with a single nod and watch as she turns to head down the stairs. I close the door and walk back to my bed, picking up the notebook on the way over. I open it up to the letter where I left off before Amy walked into my room an hour earlier.</p><p>Chapter Three-and-three-quarters</p><p>Les,</p><p>What happened with Amy just now was all your fault. Just so we\u2019re clear.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Les,</p><p>Happy two-week deathiversary. Harsh? Maybe so, but I\u2019m not apologizing. I have to go back to school Monday and I\u2019m not looking forward to it at all. Daniel has been keeping me up to date on all the rumors, despite the fact that I keep telling him I don\u2019t give a shit. Of course everyone thinks you killed yourself because of Grayson, but I know that isn\u2019t true. You were pretending to be alive long before you ever met Grayson.</p><p>And then there\u2019s the whole incident that I still haven\u2019t told you about. The one that involved me forcing Grayson to break up with you? It\u2019s a complicated story, but because of that night, everyone is now saying that I was indirectly responsible for your suicide. Daniel says people are even sympathizing with Grayson and the asshole is eating it up.</p><p>The best part about this particular rumor is that apparently my immense guilt over the hand I played in your suicide is causing me to be suicidal. And if that\u2019s what the masses are saying, then it must be true, right?</p><p>To be honest, I\u2019m way too scared to kill myself. Don\u2019t tell anyone that. (Not that you could now, even if you wanted to.) But it\u2019s true. I\u2019m a pussy when it comes to the fact that I have no idea what to expect after this life. What if the afterlife is worse than the life you\u2019re running from? Willingly taking a dive headfirst into the unknown takes some serious courage. I have to hand it to you Les, you\u2019re way braver than I am.</p><p>Okay, I\u2019m signing off. I\u2019m not used to writing so much. Texting would be way more convenient, but you like to do everything the hard way, don\u2019t you?</p><p>If I see Grayson at school on Monday, I\u2019ll rip his balls off and mail them to you. What\u2019s your new address?</p><p>Daniel is waiting for me by his car when I pull into the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the game plan?\u201d he says as soon as I open my door.</p><p>I\u2019m racking my brain for anything I might have missed. I don\u2019t remember anything significant about today that would require a game plan.</p><p>\u201cGame plan for what?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cThe game plan for today, dipshit.\u201d He points his clicker toward his car and locks his doors, then begins walking toward the school with me. \u201cI know how much you didn\u2019t want to come back, so maybe we need a game plan to counteract all the attention. Do you want me to be all sad and mopey with you so people won\u2019t want to confront us? I doubt it,\u201d he answers himself. \u201cThat might encourage people to approach you with words of encouragement that resemble condolences and I know you\u2019re sick of that shit. If you want, I can be super excitable and take all the attention off you. As much as you don\u2019t want to admit it, you\u2019re all everyone\u2019s been talking about for two weeks. I\u2019m so fucking sick of it,\u201d he says.</p><p>I hate that people don\u2019t have anything better to talk about, but I like that it bothers Daniel as much as it bothers me.</p><p>\u201cOr we could just be normal and hope people have better things to talk about than what happened with Les. Ooh! Ooh!\u201d he says giddily, turning to face me while he walks backward. \u201cI could act all pissed off and walk in front of you like a bodyguard, even though you\u2019re bigger than me. And if anyone tries to approach you I\u2019ll punch them in the face. Please? Will you play the part of pissed-off, grieving brother? For me? Please?\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cI think we\u2019ll be just fine without a game plan.\u201d</p><p>He frowns at my unwillingness to participate. \u201cYou underestimate the enjoyment other people gain from gossip and speculation. Just stay quiet and if anything needs to be said today, I\u2019ll be the one to say it. I\u2019ve been dying to yell at these people for two weeks now.\u201d</p><p>I appreciate his concern, but I really anticipate today being just like any other day. If anything, I think it would be too awkward for people to mention it when I\u2019m actually in their presence. They\u2019ll be too uncomfortable to say anything to me at all, which is exactly how I prefer it.</p><p>The bell for first period hasn\u2019t rung yet, so everyone\u2019s still standing outside. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019m walking into the school without Les by my side. Just the thought of her takes me right back to that moment when I walked into her bedroom and found her. I don\u2019t want to relive that moment again. Not right now. I pull my phone out of my pocket and pretend to be interested in it for the sake of just taking my mind off the fact that Daniel could be right. Everyone around us is way too quiet and I hope to hell it\u2019s back to normal soon.</p><p>Daniel and I don\u2019t have class together until third period so when we make it inside the building he waves me off and heads in the opposite direction. I open the door to my homeroom and almost immediately, a sudden hush falls over the classroom. Every single pair of eyes is staring back at me, quietly watching me walk to my desk.</p><p>I keep my phone out and continue to pretend I\u2019m engaged in it, but I\u2019m acutely aware of everyone around me. It keeps me from having to make eye contact with anyone, though. If I don\u2019t make eye contact, they\u2019ll be less likely to approach me. I wonder if I\u2019m just imagining a difference in the way people are acting today as opposed to before Les killed herself. Maybe it\u2019s just me. I don\u2019t want to think it\u2019s just me, though. If that\u2019s the case, then how long does this last? How long will I have to go through every second of the day thinking about her death and how it affects every aspect of my life? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I compare losing Les to losing Hope all those years ago. It seemed back then that everything that happened for months after Hope was taken somehow led to thoughts of her. I would wake up in the morning and wonder where she was waking up. I would brush my teeth and wonder if whoever took her thought to buy her a new toothbrush, since she didn\u2019t get to take anything with her. I would eat breakfast and wonder if whoever took her knew that Hope didn\u2019t like orange juice and whether or not they were letting her have white milk, because that was her favorite. I would go to bed at night and look out my bedroom window that used to face hers, and I would wonder if she even had a bedroom window where she was.</p><p>I try to think of when the thoughts finally stopped, but I\u2019m not so sure they have. I still think about her more than I should. It\u2019s been years now, but every time I look up at the sky I think about her. Every time someone calls me Dean instead of Holder, I think about her and how I used to laugh at the way she said my name when we were kids. Every time I see a bracelet on a girl I think about the bracelet Les gave her just minutes before she was taken from us.</p><p>So many things remind me of her and I hate knowing that it\u2019s just going to be worse now that Les is gone, too. Every single thing I think or see or do or say reminds me of Les. Then every single time I\u2019m reminded of Les, it leads to thoughts of Hope. Then every single time I think about Hope, I\u2019m reminded of how I let them down. I failed them both. It\u2019s as if the day I gave them their nickname, I was somehow nicknaming myself the same. Because I sure as hell feel pretty fucking hopeless right now.</p><p>I\u2019ve somehow made it through two classes without a single person speaking to me. Not that they aren\u2019t discussing it, though. It\u2019s like they think I\u2019m not even here, the way they whisper and stare and speculate about what\u2019s going on in my head.</p> <p>I take a seat next to Daniel once I arrive in Mr. Mulligan\u2019s classroom. Daniel silently asks how I\u2019m doing with just a look. Over the past few years we seem to have formed some sort of nonverbal communication between us. I shrug, letting him know that it\u2019s going. Of course it sucks and I\u2019d rather not be here at all right now, but what can I do? Suck it up. That\u2019s what.</p><p>\u201cI heard Holder\u2019s not speaking to anyone,\u201d the girl in front of me whispers to the girl seated in front of her. \u201cLike, at all. Not since he found her.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s obvious by the volume at which she\u2019s speaking that she has no idea I\u2019m sitting right behind her. Daniel lifts his head to look at them and I can see the disgust on his face, knowing I can hear their conversation.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019s taking a vow of silence,\u201d the other girl speculates.</p><p>\u201cYeah, maybe. It wouldn\u2019t have hurt Lesslie to take a vow of silence every now and then. Her laugh was so freaking annoying.\u201d</p> <p>I instantly see red. I clench my fists and find myself wishing for the first time in my life that it wasn\u2019t wrong for a guy to hit a girl. I\u2019m not angry that they\u2019re talking about her behind her back, I expected as much. I\u2019m not even angry that they\u2019re talking about her beyond the grave. I\u2019m angry because the one thing I loved the most about Les was her laugh. If they\u2019re going to say anything about her, they better not mention her fucking laugh again.</p><p>Daniel grips the edges of his desk and lifts his leg, then kicks the girl\u2019s desk as hard as he can, scooting her a good twelve inches across the floor. She squeals and immediately turns in her seat to face him.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you, Daniel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d he asks, raising his voice. He leans forward in his chair and glares at her. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s wrong with me. I\u2019m pissed that you\u2019re a girl because if you had a dick, I\u2019d be punching you in your disrespectful, fat mouth right now.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth drops open and it\u2019s obvious she\u2019s confused why he\u2019s targeted her. Her confusion is instantly cleared up the second she notices that I\u2019m right behind her, though. Her eyes grow wide and I smile at her, lifting my hand in a half-hearted wave.</p><p>I don\u2019t say anything, though. I don\u2019t really feel the need to add to anything Daniel just said and apparently I\u2019m taking a vow of silence, so I just keep my mouth shut. Besides, Daniel said he\u2019s been dying to yell at these people for two weeks now. Today might be his only chance, so I just let him do his thing. The girl immediately turns and faces the front without even offering up the slightest hint of an apology.</p> <p>The classroom door opens and Mr. Mulligan enters, breaking up the tension and naturally replacing it with his own. Les and I did everything we could to avoid having him at all this year, but we weren\u2019t very lucky. Well, I\u2019m not, anyway. Les doesn\u2019t have to worry about sitting through his tedious, hour-long lectures anymore.</p><p>\u201cDean Holder,\u201d he says as soon as he reaches his desk. \u201cI\u2019m still waiting for your research paper that was due last week. I hope you have it with you, because we\u2019re presenting today.\u201d</p><p>Shit. I haven\u2019t even thought about what I might have had due over the past two weeks.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t have it with me.\u201d</p><p>He looks up from whatever it is he\u2019s looking at on his desk and eyes me. \u201cSee me after class, then.\u201d</p><p>I nod and maybe even roll my eyes a little. Eye rolling is inevitable in his class. He\u2019s a douchebag who gets off on the control he thinks he has over a classroom. It\u2019s obvious he was bullied as a kid and anyone not wearing a pocket-protector is the recipient of his misguided revenge.</p><p>I ignore the presentations during the rest of the period and try to make a list of what assignments I might have due. Les was the organized one of the two of us. She always let me know what was due and when it was due and which class it was due in.</p><p>After what seems like hours, the bell finally rings. I remain seated until the class clears out so that Mr. Mulligan can practice his retaliation on me. Once the classroom is occupied by just the two of us, he walks to the front of his desk and leans against it, folding his arms over his chest.</p> <p>\u201cI know your family has been through quite the ordeal and I\u2019m sorry for your loss.\u201d Here we go. \u201cI just hope you understand that unfortunate things like this are going to happen throughout your life, but that doesn\u2019t give you the excuse to not live up to what\u2019s expected of you.\u201d</p><p>Jesus Christ. It\u2019s a fucking research paper. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m rewriting the Constitution. I know I should just nod and agree with him, but he picked the wrong day to play preacher.</p><p>\u201cMr. Mulligan, Les was the only sibling I had, so I actually don\u2019t foresee this happening again. As much as it seems like it happens repeatedly, she can only kill herself once.\u201d</p><p>The way his eyebrows crease together and his lips tighten into a firm line make it apparent that he doesn\u2019t find me amusing at all. Which is good, because I wasn\u2019t trying to be amusing.</p><p>\u201cSome situations should remain off-limits to your sarcasm,\u201d he says flatly. \u201cI would hope you would have a little more respect for your sister than that.\u201d</p><p>As much as I hate that I can\u2019t hit girls today, I hate the fact that I can\u2019t punch teachers even more. I immediately stand up and walk swiftly to where he\u2019s standing, stopping just inches from him, my fists down at my sides. My proximity causes his body to go rigid and I can\u2019t help but feel a sense of satisfaction knowing I\u2019ve scared him. I look him directly in the eyes, clench my teeth, and lower my voice.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit if you\u2019re a teacher, a student, or a goddamned priest. Don\u2019t you ever mention my sister again.\u201d I stare at him for several more seconds, seething, waiting on his reaction. When he fails to say anything, I turn around and grab my backpack. \u201cYou\u2019ll get your report tomorrow,\u201d I say, exiting the classroom.</p><p>I\u2019ve been convinced I was minutes away from being expelled. However, Mr. Mulligan apparently chose not to report our little interaction, because nothing has been said or done and it\u2019s now lunch break.</p><p>Moving along.</p><p>\u201cHolder,\u201d someone says from behind me in the hallway. I turn around to find Amy catching up to me.</p><p>\u201cHey, Amy.\u201d I wish her presence gave me even the slightest hint of comfort, but it doesn\u2019t. Seeing her standing here just reminds me of two weeks ago, then that reminds me of the pictures she was at my house for, then that reminds me of Les, then that reminds me of Hope. Then of course I\u2019m consumed with guilt again.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d she asks hesitantly. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard from you since . . .\u201d Her voice trails off, so I answer her quickly, not wanting her to feel she has to go into more detail.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d I reply, feeling guilty that she seems disappointed I didn\u2019t call her. I thought she was pretty clear with what happened between us. I hope she is, anyway. \u201cDid you um . . .\u201d I look down at my feet and sigh, unsure how to bring it up without sounding like a complete asshole. I shift my weight from one foot to the other and look back up at her. \u201cDid you want me to call you? Because I thought what happened . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she says quickly. \u201cNo. You thought right. I just . . . I don\u2019t know.\u201d She shrugs and looks as though she already regrets this conversation. \u201cHolder, I just wanted to make sure you were okay. I\u2019ve been hearing rumors and I\u2019d be lying if I didn\u2019t say they have me worried. I felt like I made that day at your house all about me, and I never even thought to ask you how you were holding up at all.\u201d</p><p>She looks guilty for even bringing up the rumors, but she shouldn\u2019t feel that way. She\u2019s the only person all day to actually make an active effort to ensure the rumors aren\u2019t true. \u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d I assure her. \u201cRumors are rumors, Amy.\u201d</p><p>She smiles, but doesn\u2019t seem to believe the words coming out of my mouth. The last thing I want her to do is worry about me. I wrap my arms around her and whisper in her ear. \u201cI promise, Amy. You don\u2019t need to worry about me, okay?\u201d</p><p>She nods, then pulls away from me, looking nervously down the hall to her left, then to her right. \u201cThomas,\u201d she whispers, excusing the fact that she pulled away from me. I smile at her reassuringly.</p><p>\u201cThomas,\u201d I say, nodding. \u201cNot at home helping his dad with yard stuff, I guess?\u201d</p><p>She purses her lips together and shakes her head. \u201cTake care, Holder\u201d she says, turning to walk away.</p><p>I put my things in my locker, then head to the cafeteria. I walk in several minutes after the cafeteria has filled up with people, and at first it\u2019s like any other day at lunch. But once people begin to spot me as I make my way to the table where Daniel is seated, the voices drop entire octaves and eyes can\u2019t seem to mind their own business.</p><p>The amount of drama I\u2019ve witnessed today is comical, really. Everyone I pass, even people I\u2019ve been friends with for years, all seem to think if they don\u2019t quietly watch my every move, they might miss the moment that I completely break down and lose it. I hate to disappoint them, but I\u2019ve got a pretty good handle on things today. Nobody\u2019s going to be losing it, so they might as well go back to their regular routine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>By the time I actually reach the table, the entire sound of the lunchroom has dropped to a dull murmur. All eyes are on me and I seriously wish I could tell everyone to go fuck themselves. But that would be giving them exactly the meltdown they want, so instead I keep my mouth shut.</p><p>The one thing I don\u2019t do, though, is tell Daniel he can\u2019t say what I\u2019m wishing I could say. I look him straight in the eyes as I approach the table and we have one of our quick, nonverbal conversations. A nonverbal conversation in which I give him the go-ahead to release any pent-up frustration he might still be harboring.</p><p>He grins mischievously and loudly slaps his palms down on the table. \u201cHoly motherfucking shit!\u201d he yells, climbing up onto his chair. He gestures wildly toward me. \u201cLook, everybody! It\u2019s Dean Holder!\u201d He proceeds to climb on top of the lunchroom table, pulling all the attention away from me and placing it on himself.</p><p>\u201cWhy is everyone staring at me?\u201d he yells, motioning with huge, exaggerated gestures toward me. \u201cWe have the Dean Holder here! The one and only!\u201d When only a few people look away from him toward me, he throws his hands up in the air like he\u2019s disappointed in them. \u201cCome on, guys! We\u2019ve been anticipating this moment for two weeks now! Now that he\u2019s finally here, you all decide to shut the hell up? What\u2019s up with that?\u201d He looks down at me and frowns, slumping his shoulders in defeat. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Holder. I thought today would be a little more interesting for you. I was hoping for a Q&amp;A session to kind of clear the air, but I didn\u2019t realize every single person in this school is a spineless dipshit.\u201d He begins to climb down from the table but then shoots his arm up into the air and holds up a finger. \u201cWait!\u201d he says, spinning to face the entire crowd. \u201cThat\u2019s actually a very good idea!\u201d</p> <p>I look around and expect one of the cafeteria monitors to be making their way over to him to put a stop to his spectacle, but the only monitor in the cafeteria right now is just watching him like everyone else, waiting to see what he\u2019s up to.</p><p>Daniel jumps from our table to the table next to us, stepping on a few trays in the process. He spills chocolate milk all over the table and almost slips, but presses his hand onto the top of a guy\u2019s head and straightens himself back up. The entire spectacle is pretty damn entertaining, so I take a seat at our table and watch him like I\u2019m not even the reason behind his whole outburst.</p><p>He looks down at a girl seated at the table beneath his feet and he extends his arm, pointing his finger down at her. \u201cWhat about you, Natalie? Now that we have Dean Holder here and live in person, would you like to ask him if your theory about why Les killed herself is correct?\u201d</p><p>Natalie\u2019s face reddens and she stands up. \u201cYou\u2019re an asshole, Daniel!\u201d She grabs her tray and walks away from the table. Daniel remains standing on top of the table, but his extended index finger follows her across the cafeteria.</p><p>\u201cWait, Natalie! What if Lesslie did kill herself because Grayson dumped her the same week he took her virginity? Don\u2019t you want to know if you\u2019re right? Don\u2019t you want to know what you\u2019ve won?\u201d</p> <p>Natalie exits the cafeteria, so he immediately turns his attention to Thomas, who is seated next to Amy a few tables down. She\u2019s got her hand over her mouth and she\u2019s looking at Daniel in shock like the rest of the cafeteria. He points to Thomas, then hops across three cafeteria tables to get to him. \u201cThomas!\u201d Daniel yells excitably. \u201cWhat about you? Would you like to participate in the Q&amp;A? I heard your theory this morning during first period and it was a doozy.\u201d</p><p>Thomas stands up and grabs his tray just like Natalie did. \u201cDaniel, you\u2019re being a jerk.\u201d He nods toward me. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t need this right now.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t say anything, but I actually hope Thomas gets away unscathed. I don\u2019t know what rumor he started, but even so. I\u2019m pretty sure what I did with Amy was retaliation enough, even though he\u2019ll likely never know about it.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Daniel says, pulling his hand up to his mouth in false shock. He looks over at me. \u201cHolder? Do you not need this right now? Are you like, in mourning or something? Should we be respecting that?\u201d</p><p>I try not to smile, but Daniel\u2019s doing a damn good job of turning this shitty day upside down. He steps from one table to the next, moving back toward our table.</p><p>\u201cDo you not want to participate in the Q&amp;A, Holder? I thought maybe you would want to set the record straight.\u201d He spins around and addresses the entire cafeteria again without waiting on an answer from me. Several students begin picking their trays up and exiting the cafeteria in fear that they\u2019ll be pointed out next. \u201cWhere\u2019s everyone going? None of you seem to mind discussing it any other time. Why not right now when we can actually get some honest answers? Maybe Holder could tell us all why Les really did it. Or better yet, how she did it. Maybe we could even find out the truth behind the speculation that he\u2019s suicidal, too!\u201d Daniel looks at me again and props his hands on his hips. \u201cHolder? Are the rumors true? Do you actually have the date set for when you plan to kill yourself?\u201d</p> <p>Now all eyes are definitely on me. Before I can answer, and not that I was going to, Daniel holds up his arms and faces his palms out toward me. \u201cWait! Don\u2019t answer that, Holder.\u201d He spins around to address the quickly dwindling crowd again. \u201cI think we should open it up for bets! Somebody find me a pen and paper! I\u2019ve got dibs on next Thursday,\u201d he says, pulling his wallet out of his pocket.</p><p>Apparently the cafeteria monitor draws the line at illegal betting, because she\u2019s now walking determinedly toward Daniel. He notices the monitor stalking toward him, so he shoves his wallet back into his pocket. \u201cWe\u2019ll take bets after school, then,\u201d he says quickly, jumping off the table.</p><p>I turn and head toward the doors to the cafeteria and he follows behind me. As soon as the doors swing shut behind us, the murmur of the cafeteria returns, but much louder this time. Once we\u2019re both back in the hallway near our lockers, I turn to face him.</p><p>I can\u2019t decide whether I want to punch him for what he just did or bow down to him. \u201cYou\u2019re messed up, man.\u201d I laugh.</p><p>He runs his palms down his face and falls against the lockers with a big sigh. \u201cYeah. I didn\u2019t really mean for it to go on like that. I just couldn\u2019t take another second of this shit. I don\u2019t know how you\u2019re doing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe either,\u201d I say. I open my locker and grab my car keys. \u201cI think I\u2019m just gonna call it a day. I really don\u2019t want to stick around right now.\u201d</p><p>Daniel opens his mouth to respond, but he\u2019s interrupted by someone clearing his throat behind me. I turn around to find Principal Joiner eyeing Daniel angrily. I turn back to Daniel and he lifts his shoulders innocently. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll see you tomorrow then. Looks like me and Principal Joiner have a lunch date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore like a detention date,\u201d Principal Joiner says firmly from behind me. Daniel rolls his eyes and follows the principal toward the office.</p> <p>I grab the book I need to finish Mr. Mulligan\u2019s research paper and shut my locker, then walk down the hall toward the exit. Before I round the hallway, I hear someone say Les\u2019s name and it causes me to stop in my tracks. I peer around the corner and there is a small group of four people leaning up against their lockers. One of the guys is holding a cell phone and they\u2019re all leaning over him, watching the video he\u2019s playing. Daniel\u2019s voice is coming from the speaker. Apparently someone recorded his display during lunch just now and it\u2019s already circulating. Great. Even more fuel for the gossip.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why Daniel made such a big deal out of it,\u201d the guy holding the phone says. \u201cDoes he really expect us not to talk about it? If someone is pathetic enough to kill themselves, we\u2019re obviously going to talk about it. If you ask me, Les should have tried to stick it out rather than take the easy\u2014\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t wait for him to finish his sentence. His phone shatters when I throw it against the locker, but the sound doesn\u2019t even come close to the sound my fist makes when it meets his jaw for the first time. I don\u2019t know if the punches get louder after that, though, because everything around me is instantly tuned out. He\u2019s on his back on the floor of the hallway now and I\u2019m on top of him, hitting him hard enough that I hope he\u2019s never able to open his fucking mouth again. People are pulling on my shoulders and my shirt and my arms, but I continue hitting him. I put my rage on repeat and watch as my fist grows redder and redder from the blood that smears my hand every time I swing at him.</p><p>I guess they\u2019re getting their wish after all. I\u2019m breaking down.</p><p>I\u2019m losing it.</p><p>And I don\u2019t really give a fuck.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Les,</p><p>Happy five-week deathiversary.</p><p>Sorry I haven\u2019t kept you up to speed lately, but a lot has happened. You\u2019re going to love this. I, Dean Holder, got arrested.</p><p>I got into a fight at school defending your honor two weeks ago. Well, I guess I can\u2019t really call it a fight, per se. I think two people have to be involved to constitute a fight and this incident was definitely one-sided.</p><p>Anyway, I was taken into custody. I was barely there for three hours before Mom bailed me out, though, so it sounds more badass than it actually was. I will admit, it was the first time I\u2019ve ever been thankful she\u2019s a lawyer.</p><p>I\u2019m a little more than upset right now and I don\u2019t really know what to do about it. Mom has been struggling a lot lately and my little incident at school really didn\u2019t help matters. She thinks she failed us. You killing yourself left her completely doubting her abilities as a mother, which is really hard for me to watch. Now that I went and fucked up, too, she\u2019s doubting herself even more. So much so that she\u2019s forcing me to go stay with Dad for a while.</p><p>I think it\u2019s all too much for her. After I beat that asshole up at school, she admitted to me that she thinks I need more help than she\u2019s able to give me right now. I did everything I could to change her mind, but after my court hearing this morning, it seems the judge agrees with her. Dad is on his way here right now to pick me up. Five more hours and I\u2019ll be heading back to our hometown.</p><p>Back to where the downhill slope began.</p><p>Do you remember how things used to be when we were kids? Before I let Hope climb into that car?</p><p>Things were good. Really good. Mom and Dad were happy. We were happy. We loved our neighborhood, our house, our cat that kept jumping in that damn well in the backyard. I don\u2019t even remember that cat\u2019s name, but I remember him being the stupidest damn cat I\u2019ve ever encountered.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until the day I walked away from Hope, leaving her crying in the front yard, that our lives began going downhill. After that day everything changed. The reporters showed up, the stress intensified, and our innocent trust in other people completely disappeared.</p><p>Mom wanted to move out of town and Dad didn\u2019t want to leave his job. She didn\u2019t like the fact that we still lived next door to where it happened. Remember how she wouldn\u2019t let us go outside alone for years after Hope was kidnapped? She was so scared the same thing would happen to us. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They tried to not let the stress affect their marriage, but it eventually ended up being too much. I remember the day they told us they were divorcing and selling the house, and that Mom was moving us here to be closer to her family. I\u2019ll never forget it because, aside from Hope being taken, it was the worst day of my life.</p><p>But it seemed like your best.</p><p>You were so excited to move. Why, Les? I wish I had thought to ask you while you were alive. I want to know what it was you hated about living there so much, because I really don\u2019t want to go back to Austin. I don\u2019t want to have to leave Mom. I don\u2019t want to have to stay with Dad and pretend that I\u2019m okay with him giving up on his family all those years ago. I don\u2019t want to go back to a town where every time I turn a corner, I\u2019m looking for Hope.</p><p>I miss you so damn much, Les, but it\u2019s different from the way I miss Hope. With you, I know it\u2019s not a possibility that I\u2019ll ever see you again. I know you\u2019re gone and you\u2019re not suffering anymore. But I don\u2019t have that sense of closure with Hope. Because I don\u2019t know that she\u2019s not suffering anymore. I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s dead or alive. My mind does this awful thing where it imagines the worst possible scenarios for her, and I hate it.</p> <p>What are the chances that the only two girls in my life I\u2019ve ever loved . . . I\u2019ve lost? It\u2019s killing me piece by piece every single day. I know I should probably find a way to try to get over it . . . to let go of the blame. But to be honest, I don\u2019t want to get over it. I don\u2019t want to forget that my inability to protect either of you is why I\u2019m the only one of us left. I deserve to be reminded every second that I\u2019m alive that I let both of you down, so that I can be conscious not to let myself ever do this again to anyone else.</p><p>Yeah, I definitely need a reminder. Maybe I should get a tattoo.</p><p>Chapter Five-and-a-half</p><p>Les,</p><p>What a year. I almost forgot about this notebook. Must have left it behind in my haste to pack last September. It was still sitting on my dresser, and judging by the layer of dust on it, I\u2019m guessing Mom hasn\u2019t been snooping in it. If Mom reacted to my moving in with Dad for the past year in the same way she reacted to your death, I\u2019m sure she hasn\u2019t set foot in my bedroom since the day I left. It seems easier for her to just close the doors and not think about the stillness of the rooms behind them.</p> <p>I\u2019m pretty sure the plan was for me to stay in Austin until I graduated, but I thwarted that plan with my magical ability to turn eighteen. Dad couldn\u2019t really hold me there against my will anymore. And speaking of turning eighteen . . . it was weird not having to share a birthday with you. But it was nice because Dad bought me a new car. I\u2019m pretty sure if you were alive he would have made us share the car, but you aren\u2019t alive so I get to keep it all to myself. And he didn\u2019t make me leave it in Austin when I came back home a few days ago, so that\u2019s a plus.</p><p>I missed Mom, which is the primary reason I came back. And as much as I hate to admit it, I\u2019ve missed Daniel. In fact, I\u2019m about to leave with him in a few minutes. Got to go catch up with the old crowd. It\u2019s Saturday night, so I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll find somewhere for me to show up and give people something else to talk about.</p><p>Daniel says there have been some pretty far-out rumors related to where I\u2019ve been for the past year. He said he didn\u2019t waste time dispelling any of them. He\u2019s the only one who knows where I really took off to, so I appreciate that he didn\u2019t feel the need to set anyone straight. I think he likes the fact that he\u2019s the only one who knows the truth.</p><p>One more tiny thing could be responsible for my coming back. My huge fight with Dad. Remind me to tell you all about it later.</p><p>Oh, wait. I guess you can\u2019t remind me. Fine, I\u2019ll remind myself.</p><p>Holder, don\u2019t forget to tell Les about your fight with Dad.</p> <p>Chapter Six</p><p>I can\u2019t believe he talked me into any form of social gathering my first week back. I swore I wouldn\u2019t be around these people again, but it has been a whole year. I\u2019ve had a while to adjust, so maybe they have, too.</p><p>I walk up to the unfamiliar house a few feet ahead of Daniel, but stop just short of passing through the front door. Of all the people from school I haven\u2019t seen for the past year, the last person I expect to run into is Grayson. But of course the last thing I expect is always the first to happen.</p><p>I haven\u2019t seen him since the night before Les died, when I left him bleeding on the living room floor of his best friend\u2019s house. He\u2019s walking out as I\u2019m walking in and for a few seconds, we\u2019re face to face, staring each other down. I haven\u2019t really thought about him much since I left, but seeing him now brings every ounce of hatred I had for him right back to the surface like it never even left.</p><p>I can tell by the look in his eyes that he has absolutely no idea what to say to me. I\u2019m blocking his exit and he\u2019s blocking my entrance and neither of us seems to want to be the one to step aside. Both of my hands are clenched into defensive fists, preparing for whatever he has to say. He could yell at me, he could spit at me, he could even apologize to me. Whatever words come out of his mouth, it won\u2019t matter. The urge I\u2019m having right now isn\u2019t to listen to him speak; it\u2019s to shut him up.</p><p>Daniel walks in shortly after me and notices the silent standoff occurring between us. He slips around me, then stands facing me, blocking my view of Grayson. He slaps my cheeks with both hands until my eyes meet his. \u201cNo time for jerk-offs!\u201d He yells over the music. \u201cWe have beer that needs consuming!\u201d He grabs my shoulders, still blocking my view from Grayson, and pulls me to the right. I continue to resist, not wanting to be the first to back down from our visual standoff.</p><p>Jaxon walks up and places his hand on Grayson\u2019s arm, pulling him in the opposite direction. \u201cLet\u2019s go see what Six and Sky are up to!\u201d he yells to him.</p><p>Grayson nods, watching me sternly as he backs away. \u201cYeah,\u201d he answers Jaxon. \u201cThis party just got lame.\u201d</p> <p>If this were last year, he\u2019d be on the floor with my knee resting comfortably on his throat. But this isn\u2019t last year, and his throat isn\u2019t worth it. I simply smile at him while I continue to allow Daniel to pull me away and toward the kitchen. Once Jaxon and Grayson have exited the front door, I release a pent-up breath. I\u2019m relieved at their decision to leave the party in search of whatever girls are pathetic enough to entertain them.</p><p>I grimace with that last thought, knowing I inadvertently lumped Les into that category of girls. But fortunately, I don\u2019t have to worry about the chicks Grayson hooks up with anymore. Les isn\u2019t here to be deceived by him, so as far as I\u2019m concerned, Grayson can hook up with whoever is desperate enough to have him.</p><p>\u201cPress mouth to rim, tilt head back, down your shot, and get happy,\u201d Daniel says, handing me a shot of something. I don\u2019t ask what it is, I just do what he says and down it.</p><p>One more shot, two beers, and half an hour later, Daniel and I have made our way into the living room. I\u2019m on the couch with my feet propped up on the coffee table and Daniel is next to me, running through the list of people we\u2019re friends with and telling me all about what they\u2019ve been up to for the past year. I forgot how talkative alcohol makes him and I\u2019m finding it hard to keep up. I bring my fingers to the bridge of my nose, squeezing the headache away. I don\u2019t really know anyone at this party. Daniel says most of them are friends of the kid who lives here, but I don\u2019t even know who lives here. I ask Daniel why we\u2019re even here if he doesn\u2019t know anyone and the question miraculously shuts him up. He looks past me into the kitchen and nods in that direction. \u201cHer,\u201d he says.</p><p>I look behind me at a couple of girls leaning against the bar. One of them is staring straight at Daniel, stirring her drink flirtatiously.</p><p>\u201cIf she\u2019s the reason we\u2019re here, why aren\u2019t you over there?\u201d</p><p>Daniel turns around and faces forward, folding his arms across his chest. \u201cNo fucking way, man. We haven\u2019t talked since we broke up two weeks ago. If she wants to apologize to me she can walk her pretty little ass over here.\u201d</p><p>I glance back at the girl again and notice that maybe she\u2019s not looking at him flirtatiously like I first thought. Because flirtatious grins and evil grins are divided by a very faint line and I\u2019m not sure which side of the line she\u2019s standing on, now that I\u2019m witnessing her glare.</p><p>\u201cHow long did you date her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few months. Long enough to find out she\u2019s fucking crazy,\u201d he says with a huge roll of his eyes. \u201cAnd long enough to realize that the reason why I love her is because she\u2019s fucking crazy.\u201d He sees me staring at her and he narrows his eyes. \u201cStop looking at her, man. She\u2019ll know we\u2019re talking about her.\u201d</p><p>I laugh and look away, but not fast enough to avoid witnessing the duo making their way back through the front door. Grayson is following behind Jaxon and they\u2019re both headed toward the kitchen. I rest my head into the couch and wish I had downed a few more shots. I really don\u2019t want to be preoccupied with him for the rest of the night.</p><p>Daniel begins talking incessantly again. I tune him out after he tells me about his new tires for the second time tonight, and I\u2019m doing a pretty good job of staying inside my own head until Jaxon and Grayson move closer to the living room. They have no idea I\u2019m seated on the couch and I\u2019d really like to keep it that way. Now if Daniel would just shut up long enough for me to tell him I\u2019m ready to leave.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so fucking sick of it,\u201d I overhear Grayson saying. \u201cEvery Saturday night it\u2019s the same thing. I swear to God if she doesn\u2019t give it up next weekend I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>Jaxon laughs. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure all Sky needs is a good dose of rejection. Girls like rejection.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure who Sky is, but I like that she\u2019s refusing to give it up to Grayson. Smart girl.</p><p>\u201cI doubt that would work with her,\u201d Grayson says, laughing. \u201cShe\u2019s pretty damn stubborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah she is,\u201d Jaxon agrees. \u201cYou would think with everything we\u2019ve heard about her that she\u2019d be a little less difficult. That girl has got to be the sluttiest virgin I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p><p>Grayson laughs at Jaxon\u2019s comment, and I have to try extra hard in my attempt to tune them out. Hearing the way they\u2019re talking about this girl infuriates me, because I know Grayson more than likely talked about Les this same way when he dated her.</p><p>Grayson continues talking shit about her, and the more I sit here and listen to it, the more I have to hear that pathetic laugh come out of his mouth. All it makes me want to do is shut him up.</p><p>I pull my feet off the couch and begin to turn around in order to tell them to fuck off, but Daniel puts a hand on my shoulder and shakes his head. \u201cAllow me,\u201d he says with a mischievous grin. He pulls his legs up onto the couch and spins around, facing Grayson and Jaxon.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d he says, holding his hand up in the air like he\u2019s in class. He\u2019s always so animated, even when he knows he\u2019s about to get his ass kicked. I may be able to hold my own against Grayson, but Daniel knows he can\u2019t, yet that doesn\u2019t seem to stop him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Both Grayson and Jaxon turn to him, but Grayson\u2019s eyes stop short once they collide with mine. I hold his obnoxious stare while Daniel hugs the pillow on the back of the couch and continues speaking to them. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help but overhear your conversation just now. As much as I\u2019d like to agree that Sky is the sluttiest virgin either of you have ever met, I feel the need to point out that this observation is completely inaccurate. You see, after I spent last night with her, she can\u2019t really be considered a virgin anymore. So, maybe it\u2019s not her virginity she\u2019s attempting to hold on to by refusing to sleep with you, Grayson. It\u2019s more than likely her dignity.\u201d</p><p>Grayson is over the back of the couch and has Daniel pinned to the floor in a matter of seconds. I, being of somewhat sound mind, give Daniel the ten seconds he needs to reverse the situation before I interrupt. However, I\u2019m disappointed in my lack of faith in Daniel because he has Grayson flipped over and on his back in less than five. He must have been working out while I was away.</p><p>I slowly stand up when I see Jaxon make his way to the front of the couch to assist Grayson. He grabs Daniel by the shoulder to pull him off Grayson, but I grab the back of Jaxon\u2019s shirt and yank him until he\u2019s seated on the couch. I step closer, just as Grayson delivers a punch to Daniel\u2019s jaw. Daniel is about to return the swing, but I grab his arm and pull him up before he has the chance.</p><p>Over the years this has become a game to Daniel. He urges people on and counts on me to step in and put a stop to his fights before he gets fucked up. Unfortunately, since I always seem to be in the background during these incidents, my name has become associated with all of the fights and his quick temper. In reality, I\u2019ve only actually ever hit three people.</p> <p>1) The asshole who talked shit about Les.</p><p>2) Grayson.</p><p>3) My father.</p><p>And I only regret the last one.</p><p>People are rushing through the front door to get a glimpse of the action, but they\u2019ll be disappointed, because I\u2019m pushing Daniel out of the house before he can do or say anything else. The last thing I need right now is an excuse to fight Grayson. I\u2019ve been back less than a week. I sure as hell don\u2019t want to give my mother another reason to force me back to Austin.</p> <p>Daniel is wiping blood from his lip and I\u2019ve still got hold of his arm when we reach his car. He yanks his arm free and grabs the bottom of his shirt, pulling it up to his mouth. \u201cDammit,\u201d he says, pulling back the shirt to look at the blood. \u201cWhy do I keep instigating shit that risks fucking up this beautiful face of mine?\u201d He grins and wipes the blood from his mouth for a second time.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry about it,\u201d I say, laughing at how worried he always is about his looks. \u201cYou\u2019re still prettier than me.\u201d</p><p>Daniel grins. \u201cThanks, babe,\u201d he says teasingly.</p><p>Someone is walking up behind Daniel and for a second my fists clench, thinking it might be Grayson. I relax when I see it\u2019s just the girl Daniel was referring to who was staring at him from the kitchen earlier. I don\u2019t know why I relax, though, because this girl has a definite murderous look about her. Daniel is still wiping the blood from his mouth when she walks up beside him.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell is Sky?\u201d</p><p>Daniel snaps his head in her direction and his eyes grow wide with surprise. \u201cWho? What the hell are you talking about, Val?\u201d</p> <p>She rolls her eyes and lifts her hand, pointing toward the house. \u201cI heard you in there telling Grayson you screwed her last night!\u201d</p><p>Daniel glances at the house, then back to Val, and it suddenly hits him. \u201cNo, Val!\u201d Daniel says, walking forward and grabbing her hands. \u201cNo, no, no! He was talking shit and I was just trying to piss him off. I don\u2019t even know the girl he was talking about. I swear\u2014\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s walking away from him and he\u2019s following after her, pleading with her to listen to him. I decide now is a good time to head home. I caught a ride here with Daniel, but it looks like he\u2019ll be preoccupied for a while. I\u2019m only four miles from my house so I text him and tell him I\u2019m headed home, then start in that direction.</p><p>This entire night has reminded me of all the things I don\u2019t want to be around. Drama. Testosterone. Grayson. Everything about high school in general, really. I\u2019m supposed to fill out my transfer paperwork on Monday, but I honestly don\u2019t know that I really want to go back. I know there are ways I can test out. There\u2019s just no way in hell my mother would allow that to happen.</p><p>Chapter Six-and-a-half</p><p>Les,</p><p>Okay, so here goes.</p><p>Last week, our dear stepmother Pamela walked in on me and a girl. She wasn\u2019t just any girl. Her name was Makenna and I\u2019d been out with her a few times. She was cool but it was nothing serious and that\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say about that. But anyway, Pamela got home early and Makenna and I were sort of in a compromising position on the living room sofa. You remember the sofa that Pamela kept the plastic on for three years because she was too scared anyone would get stains on it?</p> <p>Yeah. It wasn\u2019t pretty.</p><p>Especially since Makenna and I had made our way into the living room after leaving a trail of clothing from the pool, down the hallway, and to the couch. So, not only were we both completely naked, but I had to walk down the hall and back outside to find my shorts and Makenna\u2019s clothes. Pamela was screaming at me the entire way outside and the entire way back into the house and the entire way to Makenna\u2019s car.</p><p>It embarrassed the hell out of Makenna and she kind of called things off with me after that. But that\u2019s fine, because I have this cool tattoo now that says Hopeless (remember the nickname I gave you and Hope?) and it reminds me not to get too close to anyone, so I hadn\u2019t allowed myself to develop any real feelings for her yet. It was really just about the sex.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe I just said that to my own sister. Sorry.</p><p>Anyway, as you can guess, Dad was furious when he got home. He has one rule and one rule only in his house.</p><p>Don\u2019t piss off Pamela.</p><p>I broke the rule. I broke it hard.</p><p>He actually tried to ground me, and I might have laughed a tiny bit when he said it. I wasn\u2019t trying to be disrespectful, because you know that, as much as he disappointed me throughout the years, I still wouldn\u2019t do something to outright disrespect him. But the fact that he tried to ground me four days after I turned eighteen just really struck a funny chord and dammit . . . I laughed.</p><p>He didn\u2019t find it amusing at all and he was pissed. He started yelling at me, calling me disrespectful and ungrateful, and it pissed me off because I mean shit, Les. I\u2019m eighteen! I\u2019m a guy! Guys do shit like have sex with girls in their parents\u2019 houses when they\u2019re eighteen. But Christ if he didn\u2019t act like I\u2019d murdered someone! So, yeah. He pissed me off and I might have lost my temper.</p><p>But that\u2019s not the bad part. The bad part happened after I yelled at him in return and he bowed up to me. He actually had the balls to bow up to me. Not that he\u2019s bigger than me, but still. I\u2019m his son and he bowed up to me like he wanted to fight me.</p><p>So what did I do?</p><p>I hit him.</p><p>I didn\u2019t hit him very hard, but it was hard enough that it hurt him in the most sensitive spot possible. His pride.</p><p>He didn\u2019t hit me back. He didn\u2019t even yell at me. He just pulled his hand up to his jaw and he looked at me like he was disappointed, then he turned around and walked away. I left an hour later and drove back home. We haven\u2019t spoken since.</p><p>I know I should probably call him and apologize, but didn\u2019t he start it by bowing up to me? Just a little bit? What kind of dad does that to his own son?</p><p>But then again, what kind of son hits his own dad?</p><p>God, Les. I feel like shit. I never should have done it. I know I need to call him, but . . . I don\u2019t know. Shit.</p><p>To my knowledge, he never even told Mom what happened. because she hasn\u2019t mentioned it at all. She was surprised to see me back when I walked through the front door a few days ago. Happy, but surprised. She didn\u2019t ask what prompted my return, so I didn\u2019t volunteer the information. She seems different now. I can still see the heartache in her eyes, but it\u2019s not as prominent as it was when I left last year. She actually smiles now, which is good.</p><p>Her happiness will be short-lived, though. It\u2019s Monday and school started today. The first day of senior year. She left for work before I woke up. I actually had my alarm set and everything ready. I made it to school and did my morning workout, but all I could think about while I was running the track was how much I didn\u2019t want to be there.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to be there without you. I don\u2019t want to face everything I hate about that school and the majority of the people in it.</p><p>So what did I do when I finished my run? I walked back to the parking lot, got into my car, drove home, and went back to sleep. Now it\u2019s almost three o\u2019clock in the afternoon and Mom will be home in a couple of hours. I\u2019m about to head to the grocery store for a few things because I\u2019ll be cooking her dinner tonight. I plan to break the news to her about my dropping out of school. I know she won\u2019t be happy about my testing out, rather than getting a traditional diploma, so I put cookies on the grocery list, too. Women love cookies, right?</p><p>I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m not going back to school. I just never thought it would come to that. I\u2019m blaming you for that one, too.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>\u201cWill that be all for you today?\u201d the cashier asks.</p><p>I mentally run through the items on my list, ending with cookies. \u201cYep,\u201d I say as I pull my wallet from my pocket to pay the cashier. I\u2019m just relieved I got in and out without seeing anyone I know.</p><p>\u201cHey, Holder.\u201d</p><p>Spoke too soon.</p><p>I glance up to see the cashier operating the line next to me, staring me down. She\u2019s practically offering herself up on a platter with the way she\u2019s looking at me. Whoever this girl is, her expression is begging for attention. I feel sort of bad for her, especially with the way her voice climbed into that annoying, high-pitched, why-do-girls-think-baby-talk-is-sexy range. I glance down at her nametag, because I honestly can\u2019t place her face for the life of me.</p><p>\u201cHey . . . Shayla.\u201d I give her a quick nod, then look back at my cashier, hoping my guarded response is enough to let her know that I\u2019m not in the mood to feed her ego.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Shayna,\u201d she snaps.</p><p>Oops.</p><p>I glance at her nametag again, disappointed that I\u2019m giving her even more reason to keep talking. However, her nametag clearly reads Shayla. I want to laugh, but feel even more sympathy for her now. \u201cSorry. But you do realize your nametag says Shayla, right?\u201d</p><p>She immediately flips the nametag up on her smock and frowns. I\u2019m hoping this is embarrassing enough that she doesn\u2019t look up at me again, but it doesn\u2019t even faze her.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you get back?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I have no idea who this chick is, but she somehow knows me. Not only does she know me, but she knows I had to leave in order to come back. I sigh, disappointed that I still underestimate everyone\u2019s penchant for gossip.</p><p>\u201cLast week,\u201d I say, offering up no further explanation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo are they gonna let you come back to school?\u201d she asks.</p><p>What\u2019s with the \u201clet you\u201d part of her question? Since when was I not allowed back at school? That has to be attached to some sort of rumor.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. Not going back.\u201d</p><p>I haven\u2019t really decided whether or not I\u2019ll be enrolling tomorrow, since I failed to do it today. It really all depends on my conversation with my mother tonight, but it seems easier just to give the people what they want, which is more fuel for their gossip. Besides, if I dispel every single thing everyone has said about me for the past year, I\u2019ll be leaving everyone with no one to spread rumors about.</p> <p>\u201cYou suck, man,\u201d my cashier says quietly as he removes the debit card from my hand. \u201cWe had bets on how long it would take her to realize her nametag was misspelled. She\u2019s been wearing it for two months now and I had dibs on three. You just lost me twenty bucks.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. He hands me back the debit card and I place it in my wallet. \u201cMy bad,\u201d I say. I pull out a twenty-dollar bill and hold it out to him. \u201cTake this, because I\u2019m pretty sure you would have won.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head, refusing to take the twenty.</p><p>I\u2019m placing the money back into my wallet when I notice out of the corner of my eye someone in the next checkout line. The girl has completely turned around and is staring at me, more than likely trying to get my attention in the same way that Shayna/Shayla tried. I just hope this chick doesn\u2019t start up with that same baby-talk voice.</p><p>I glance up at her to get a quick look. I really wanted to avoid glancing at her, but when people are staring you down it\u2019s hard not to make eye contact, if even for a second. But the second I actually do make eye contact with her, I freeze.</p> <p>I can\u2019t look away now, even though I\u2019m trying like hell to shake the image standing in front of me.</p><p>My heart stops.</p><p>Time stops.</p><p>The whole world stops.</p><p>My quick glance turns into a full-on, unintentional stare.</p><p>I recognize those eyes.</p> <p>Those are Hope\u2019s eyes.</p><p>It\u2019s her nose, her mouth, her lips, her hair. Everything about this girl is Hope. Out of all the times in the past I thought I\u2019d spotted her when glancing at girls my age, I\u2019ve never been more sure than I am right now. I\u2019m so sure about it that it completely inhibits my ability to speak. I don\u2019t think I could say her name even if she begged me to.</p><p>So many emotions are coursing through me right now and I can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m angry or elated or freaked the hell out.</p><p>Does she recognize me, too?</p><p>We\u2019re still staring at each other and I can\u2019t stop wondering if I look familiar to her. She doesn\u2019t smile. I wish she would smile because I would recognize Hope\u2019s smile anywhere.</p><p>She tucks in her chin, darts her eyes away, and quickly turns around to face her cashier again. She\u2019s obviously flustered and it\u2019s not in the same way that I tend to leave girls like Shayna/Shayla flustered. It\u2019s a completely different reaction, which only makes me all the more curious if she just remembered me.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d The word rushes loudly out of my mouth involuntarily and I notice her flinch when I speak. She\u2019s hurrying her cashier at this point, grabbing her sacks in a frenzy. It\u2019s almost as if she\u2019s trying to get away from me.</p><p>Why is she trying to run from me? If she didn\u2019t just recognize me . . . why would she be this disturbed? And if she did recognize me, why wouldn\u2019t she be happy?</p> <p>She exits the store in a rush, so I grab my sacks and leave the receipt with the cashier. I have to get outside before she drives away. I can\u2019t just let her go again. I head directly through the exit and scroll over the parking lot until I spot her. Luckily, she\u2019s still loading her groceries into her backseat. I pause before walking up behind her, hoping I don\u2019t come off as crazy, because that\u2019s exactly how I feel right now.</p><p>She\u2019s about to shut her door, so I take a few steps closer.</p><p>I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been this scared to speak.</p><p>What do I say? What the hell do I say?</p><p>I\u2019ve imagined this moment for thirteen years and I have no fucking idea how to approach her.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>Hey? Jesus, Holder. Nice. Real nice.</p><p>She freezes midmovement. I can tell by the way her shoulders rise and fall that she\u2019s taking a calming breath. Does she need calming because of me? My heart is racing at warp speed and thirteen years\u2019 worth of pent-up adrenaline is making its way through my body.</p><p>Thirteen years. I\u2019ve been looking for her for thirteen years and I very well may have just found her. Alive. And in the same town as me. I should be elated, but I can\u2019t stop thinking about Les and how I know she prayed every single day for this moment. Les spent her whole life wishing we would find Hope and now I\u2019ve found her and Les is dead. If this girl really is Hope, I\u2019ll be devastated that she showed up thirteen months too late.</p><p>Well, maybe not devastated. I forgot that word is on reserve. But I\u2019ll be pretty damn pissed.</p><p>She\u2019s facing me now. She\u2019s looking right at me and it\u2019s killing me because I want to grab her and hug her and tell her how sorry I am for ruining her life, but I can\u2019t do any of these things because she\u2019s looking at me like she has no clue who I am. I just want to scream, \u201cHope! It\u2019s me! It\u2019s Dean!\u201d</p><p>I grip the back of my neck and try to process this whole situation. This isn\u2019t how I pictured finding her. Maybe I fictionalized it and played it up all these years but I thought her recovery would be way more climactic. I thought she would have way more tears and way more emotion and not appear to be nearly as . . . inconvenienced?</p><p>The look on her face right now doesn\u2019t register as recognition in the least. She looks terrified. Maybe she doesn\u2019t recognize me. Maybe she appeared flustered inside because of the idiotic way I was staring at her. Maybe she appears terrified now because I practically chased her down and I\u2019m giving her absolutely no explanation. I\u2019m just standing here like a creepy stalker and I have no idea how to even ask her if she\u2019s the girl I lost all those years ago.</p><p>She eyes me warily up and down. I hold out my hand, hoping to ease some of her fear with an introduction. \u201cI\u2019m Holder.\u201d</p><p>She drops her gaze to my extended hand and, rather than accept the handshake, she actually takes a step away from me.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d she says sharply, cautiously peering back up to my face.</p><p>Definitely not the reaction I expected.</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d I say, not really meaning to appear taken aback. But honestly, this isn\u2019t going in the direction I was hoping it would go. I don\u2019t even know what direction that was at this point. I\u2019m starting to doubt my own sanity. I glance across the parking lot at my car and wish I had just kept walking, but I know if I did, I\u2019d regret not confronting her.</p><p>\u201cThis might sound lame,\u201d I warn, looking back at her, \u201cbut you look really familiar. Do you mind if I ask what your name is?\u201d</p><p>She releases a breath and rolls her eyes, then reaches behind her to grab the doorknob of her car. \u201cI\u2019ve got a boyfriend,\u201d she says. She turns and opens the door, then quickly climbs into the car. She starts to pull the door shut, but I catch it with my hand.</p><p>I can\u2019t let her leave until I\u2019m positive she\u2019s not Hope. I\u2019ve never been so sure about anything in my life and I\u2019m not about to let thirteen years of guilt and obsessing and analyzing her disappearance go to waste just because I\u2019m afraid I might piss her off.</p><p>\u201cYour name. That\u2019s all I want.\u201d</p><p>She stares at my hand holding open her door. \u201cDo you mind?\u201d she says through clenched teeth. Her eyes fall to the tattoo on my arm and my adrenaline kicks up a notch when she reads it, hoping it\u2019ll spark some recognition on her part. If she can\u2019t remember my face, I\u2019m almost positive she\u2019ll remember the nickname I gave her and Les.</p><p>Not even the slightest jar of emotion flashes in her eyes.</p><p>She attempts to pull the door shut again but I refuse to release it until I get what I need from her.</p><p>\u201cYour name. Please.\u201d</p><p>When I say please this time, her expression eases slightly and she looks back up at me. It isn\u2019t until she looks at me this way, without all the anger, that I realize why I\u2019m so flustered. It\u2019s because I care more for this girl than any other girl in the world who isn\u2019t Les. I loved Hope like a sister when we were kids and seeing her again has brought back all those same feelings. It\u2019s causing my hands to shake and my heart to pound and my chest to ache because all I want to do is wrap my arms around her and hold her and thank God we finally found each other.</p><p>But all those feelings come to a screeching halt when the wrong answer comes out of her mouth. \u201cSky,\u201d she says quietly.</p><p>\u201cSky,\u201d I say aloud, trying to make sense of it. Because she\u2019s not Sky. She\u2019s Hope. She can\u2019t not be my Hope.</p><p>Sky.</p><p>Sky, Sky, Sky.</p><p>She\u2019s not saying she\u2019s Hope, but the name Sky is still eerily familiar. What\u2019s so significant about that name?</p><p>Then it hits me.</p><p>Sky.</p><p>This is the girl Grayson was referring to Saturday night.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d I ask her, hoping for a miracle that she\u2019s as dense as Shayna and just gave me the wrong name. If she really isn\u2019t Hope, then I completely understand her reaction to my seemingly erratic behavior.</p><p>She sighs and pulls her ID from her back pocket. \u201cPretty sure I know my own name,\u201d she says, flashing her driver\u2019s license in front of me.</p><p>I take it from her.</p><p>Linden Sky Davis.</p><p>A wave of disappointment crashes around me, swallowing me up. Drowning me. I feel like I\u2019m losing her all over again.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I say, backing away from her car. \u201cMy mistake.\u201d</p><p>She watches me as I back up even farther so she can shut her door. In a way, she looks disappointed. I don\u2019t even want to think about what kind of expression she\u2019s seeing on my face right now. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a mixture of anger, disappointment, embarrassment . . . but most of all, fear. I watch as she drives away and I feel like I just let Hope go all over again.</p><p>I know she\u2019s not Hope. She proved she wasn\u2019t Hope.</p><p>So why is my gut instinct telling me to stop her?</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d I groan, threading my hand through my hair. I\u2019m seriously messed up. I can\u2019t get over Hope. I can\u2019t get over Les. It\u2019s getting so bad it\u2019s to the point that I\u2019m chasing random girls down in the damn grocery store parking lot?</p><p>I turn away and slam my fist down on the hood of the car next to me, pissed at myself for thinking I finally had it all together. I don\u2019t have it together. Not in the least.</p><p>I\u2019m not even completely out of my car before I have Facebook pulled up on my phone. I enter Sky\u2019s name and no results come up. I swing open the front door and head straight up the stairs to get my laptop.</p><p>I can\u2019t let this rest. If I don\u2019t convince myself that she isn\u2019t Hope, I\u2019ll drive myself crazy. I open my laptop and enter her information again but come up empty. I search every site I can think of for over half an hour, but her name doesn\u2019t return any results. I try searching by her birthday, but come up empty again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I type in Hope\u2019s information and immediately have a screen full of news articles and returns. But I don\u2019t need to look at them. I\u2019ve spent the last several years reading every article and every lead that\u2019s reported about Hope\u2019s disappearance. I know them by heart. I slam the computer shut.</p><p>I need to run.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>She has no distinct features that I can remember. No birthmarks. The fact that I saw a girl with brown hair and brown eyes and felt she was the same brown-haired, brown-eyed girl from thirteen years ago is quite possibly borderline obsessive.</p> <p>Am I obsessed? Do I somehow feel as though I won\u2019t be able to move past Les\u2019s death if I don\u2019t rectify at least one of the things I\u2019ve fucked up in my life?</p><p>I\u2019m being ridiculous. I\u2019ve got to let it go. I\u2019ve got to let go of the fact that I\u2019ll never have Les back and I\u2019ll never find Hope.</p><p>I have these same thoughts for the entire two miles of my run. The weight in my chest lightens little by little with each step I take. I remind myself with each step that Sky is Sky and Hope is Hope and Les is dead and I\u2019m the only one left and I\u2019ve got to get my shit together.</p><p>The run begins to help ease some of the tension built up from the incident at the grocery store. I\u2019ve convinced myself that Sky isn\u2019t Hope, but for some reason even though I\u2019m almost positive she\u2019s not Hope, I still find myself thinking about Sky. I can\u2019t get the thought of her out of my head and I wonder if that\u2019s Grayson\u2019s fault. If I hadn\u2019t heard him talking about her at the party the other night, I probably would have moved on from the grocery store incident fairly quickly and I wouldn\u2019t be thinking about her at all.</p><p>But I can\u2019t stop this growing urge to protect her. I know how Grayson is and somehow, just seeing this girl for even a few minutes, I know she doesn\u2019t deserve what he\u2019s likely going to put her through. There isn\u2019t a single girl in this world who deserves the type of guy Grayson is.</p> <p>Sky said she had a boyfriend at the store and the possibility that she might consider Grayson her boyfriend gets under my skin. I don\u2019t know why, but it does. Just thinking she was Hope for even a few minutes already has me feeling extremely territorial about her.</p><p>Especially now as I round the corner and see her standing in front of my house.</p><p>She\u2019s here. Why the hell is she here?</p><p>I stop running and drop my hands to my knees, keeping my eyes trained on her back while I catch my breath. Why the hell is she standing in front of my house?</p><p>She\u2019s at the edge of my driveway, propped up against my mailbox. She\u2019s drained the last of her water bottle and she\u2019s shaking it above her mouth, attempting to get more water out of it, but it\u2019s completely empty. When she realizes this, her shoulders slump and she tilts her face toward the sky.</p><p>It\u2019s obvious she\u2019s a runner with those legs.</p> <p>Holy shit, I can\u2019t breathe.</p><p>I try to recall everything on her driver\u2019s license and what all Grayson said about her Saturday night because I suddenly want to know everything there is to know about her. And not because I thought she was Hope, but because whoever she is . . . she\u2019s fucking beautiful. I don\u2019t know that I even noticed how attractive she was at the store, because my mind wasn\u2019t going there. But right now, seeing her in front of me? My mind is all over that.</p><p>She takes a deep breath, then begins walking. I immediately kick into gear and ease up behind her.</p><p>\u201cHey, you.\u201d</p><p>She pauses at the sound of my voice and her shoulders immediately tense. She turns around slowly and I can\u2019t help but smile at the wary expression strewn across her face.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she says back, shocked to see me standing in front of her. She actually seems more at ease this time. Not as terrified of me as she was in the parking lot, which is good. Her eyes slowly drop down to my chest, then to my shorts. She looks back up at me momentarily, then diverts her gaze to her feet.</p><p>I casually lean against the mailbox and pretend to ignore the fact that she totally just checked me out. I\u2019ll ignore it to save her embarrassment, but I\u2019m definitely not going to forget it. In fact, I\u2019ll probably be thinking about the way her eyes scrolled down my body for the rest of the damn day.</p><p>\u201cYou run?\u201d I ask. It\u2019s probably the most obvious question in the world right now, but I\u2019m completely out of material.</p> <p>She nods, still breathing heavily from the effect of her workout. \u201cUsually in the mornings,\u201d she confirms. \u201cI forgot how hot it is in the afternoons.\u201d She lifts her hand to her eyes to shield them from the sun while she looks at me. Her skin is flush and her lips are dry. I hold out my water bottle and she flinches again. I try not to laugh, but I feel pretty damn pathetic that I freaked her out so much at the store that she\u2019s afraid I might actually do something to harm her.</p><p>\u201cDrink this.\u201d I nudge my water bottle toward her. \u201cYou look exhausted.\u201d</p><p>She grabs the water without hesitation and presses her lips to the rim, downing several gulps. \u201cThanks,\u201d she says, handing it back to me. She wipes the water off her top lip with the back of her hand and glances behind her. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve got another mile and a half return, so I better get started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCloser to two and a half,\u201d I say. I\u2019m trying not to stare, but it\u2019s so hard when she\u2019s wearing next to nothing and every single curve of her mouth and neck and shoulders and chest and stomach seems like it was made just for me. If I could preorder the perfect girl, I wouldn\u2019t even come close to the version standing in front of me right now.</p><p>I press the bottle of water to my mouth, knowing it\u2019s more than likely the closest I\u2019ll ever get to her lips. I can\u2019t even take my eyes off her long enough to take a drink.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d she says, shaking her head. She seems flustered. God, please let her be flustered.</p><p>\u201cI said it\u2019s more like two and a half. You live over on Conroe, that\u2019s over two miles away. That\u2019s almost a five-mile run round trip.\u201d I don\u2019t know many girls who run, let alone a five-mile stretch. Impressive.</p><p>Her eyes narrow and she pulls her arms up, folding them across her stomach. \u201cYou know what street I live on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze remains tepid and focused on mine and she\u2019s quiet. Her eyes eventually narrow slightly and it looks like she\u2019s growing annoyed with my continued silence.</p><p>\u201cLinden Sky Davis, born September 29; 1455 Conroe Street. Five feet three inches. Donor.\u201d</p><p>As soon as the word \u201cdonor\u201d leaves my mouth, she immediately steps back, her look of annoyance turning into a mixture of shock and horror. \u201cYour ID,\u201d I say quickly, explaining why I know so much about her. \u201cYou showed me your ID earlier. At the store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou looked at it for two seconds,\u201d she says defensively.</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI have a good memory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou stalk.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cI stalk? You\u2019re the one standing in front of my house.\u201d I point to my house behind me, then tap my fingers against the mailbox to show her that she\u2019s the one encroaching. Not me.</p><p>Her eyes grow wide in embarrassment as she takes in the house behind me. Her face grows redder with the realization of how it must look for her to be randomly hanging out in front of my house. \u201cWell, thanks for the water,\u201d she says quickly. She waves at me and turns around, breaking into a stride.</p><p>\u201cWait a sec,\u201d I yell after her. I run past her and turn around, trying to think up an excuse for her not to leave just yet. \u201cLet me refill your water.\u201d I reach down and grab her water bottle. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d I take off toward the house, hoping to buy myself some more time with her. I\u2019ve obviously got a lot to make up for in the first-impressions department.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the girl?\u201d my mother asks once I reach the kitchen. I run Sky\u2019s bottle of water under the tap until it\u2019s full, then I turn around to face her. \u201cHer name is Sky,\u201d I say, smiling. \u201cMet her at the grocery store earlier.\u201d</p><p>My mother glances out the window at her, then looks back at me and cocks her head. \u201cAnd you already brought her to our house? Moving a little quickly, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>I hold up the water bottle. \u201cShe just happened to be running by and now she\u2019s out of water.\u201d I walk toward the door and turn back to my mother and wink. \u201cLucky for me, we just happen to have water.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. The smile on my mother\u2019s face is nice because they\u2019ve been so few and far between. \u201cWell, good luck, Casanova,\u201d she calls after me.</p><p>I run the water back out to Sky and she immediately takes another drink. I attempt to find a way to rectify her first impression of me.</p><p>\u201cSo . . . earlier?\u201d I say hesitantly. \u201cAt the store? If I made you uneasy, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>She looks me straight in the eyes. \u201cYou didn\u2019t make me uneasy.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s lying. I absolutely made her uneasy. Terrified her, even. But she\u2019s looking at me now with such confidence.</p><p>She\u2019s confusing. Really confusing.</p><p>I watch her for a minute, trying my best to read her, but I have no clue. If I was to hit on her right now, I don\u2019t know if she\u2019d punch me or kiss me. At this point, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019d be more than okay with either.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to hit on you, either,\u201d I say, wanting to get some sort of reaction from her. \u201cI just thought you were someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she says softly. Her smile is tight-lipped and the disappointment in her voice is clear. It makes me smile, knowing that disappointed her a little bit.</p><p>\u201cNot that I wouldn\u2019t hit on you,\u201d I clarify. \u201cI just wasn\u2019t doing it at that particular moment.\u201d</p><p>She smiles. It\u2019s the first time I actually get a genuine smile from her and it feels like I just won a triathlon.</p><p>\u201cWant me to run with you?\u201d I ask, pointing toward her path home.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>I nod, but don\u2019t like her answer. \u201cWell, I was going that way anyway. I run twice a day and I\u2019ve still got a couple . . .\u201d</p><p>I take a step closer to her when I notice the fresh, prominent bruise under her eye. I grab her chin and tilt her head back to get a better look at it. My previous thoughts are sidetracked and I\u2019m suddenly overwhelmed with a need to kick the ass of whoever touched her.</p><p>\u201cWho did this to you? Your eye wasn\u2019t like this earlier.\u201d</p><p>She backs away from my grasp. \u201cIt was an accident. Never interrupt a teenage girl\u2019s nap.\u201d She tries to laugh it off, but I know better. I\u2019ve seen enough unexplained bruises on Les in the past to know that girls can hide this kind of shit better than anyone wants to admit.</p><p>I run my thumb over her bruise, calming the anger coursing through me. \u201cYou would tell someone, right? If someone did this to you?\u201d</p><p>She just stares up at me. No response. No, \u201cYes, of course I would tell.\u201d Not even a, \u201cMaybe.\u201d Her lack of acknowledgment takes me right back to these situations with Les. She never admitted to Grayson physically hurting her, but the bruises I saw on her arm the week before I made him break up with her almost ended in murder. If I find out he\u2019s the one who did this to Sky, he\u2019ll no longer have a hand left to lay on her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m running with you,\u201d I say.

She begins running, so I fall into a steady stride with her. I\u2019m fuming the entire run back to the house. Pissed that I never got to the bottom of what happened with Les and pissed that Sky might be dealing with the same shit.</p><p>We don\u2019t speak the entire run back to her house until she turns and waves good-bye at the edge of her driveway. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll see you later?\u201d she says, walking backward toward her house.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d I say, knowing full well I\u2019ll be seeing her again. Especially now that I know where she lives.</p> <p>She smiles and turns toward her house and it isn\u2019t until she\u2019s halfway up her driveway that I realize I don\u2019t even have a way to contact her. She doesn\u2019t have a Facebook, so I can\u2019t contact her that way. I don\u2019t know her phone number. I can\u2019t really just show up at her house unannounced.</p><p>I don\u2019t want her to walk away until I know for sure I\u2019ll talk to her again.</p><p>I immediately twist the lid off my water bottle and pour the contents of it onto the grass. I put the lid back on it.</p><p>\u201cSky, wait,\u201d I yell. She pauses and turns back around. \u201cDo me a favor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p> <p>I toss her the conveniently empty bottle of water. She catches it, then nods and runs inside to refill it. I pull my cell phone from my pocket and immediately text Daniel.</p><p>Sky Davis. Girl Grayson was talking about Saturday night? Does she have a boyfriend?</p><p>Sky opens her front door and begins to make her way back outside when he responds.</p><p>She has several from what I hear.</p><p>I\u2019m still staring at the text when she reaches me with the water. I take it from her and down a drink, not sure why it\u2019s hard for me to find truth in Daniel\u2019s text. As much as she\u2019s still an enigma to me, I can tell by the way she\u2019s so guarded that she doesn\u2019t let people in that easily. Based on my interaction with her, she just doesn\u2019t fit the description that\u2019s being painted of her by everyone else.</p><p>I put the lid back on the water bottle and do my best to keep my eyes focused on hers, but dammit if that sports bra isn\u2019t a magnet right now. \u201cDo you run track?\u201d I ask her, attempting to stay focused.</p> <p>She covers her stomach with her arms and her movement makes me want to punch myself for being so obvious about checking her out. The last thing I want to do is make her uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about trying out, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should. You\u2019re barely out of breath and you just ran close to five miles. Are you a senior?\u201d</p><p>She smiles. That\u2019s twice she\u2019s smiled at me like that, and it\u2019s really beginning to mess with my head.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you already know if I\u2019m a senior?\u201d she says, still grinning. \u201cYou\u2019re slacking on your stalking skills.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cWell, you make it sort of difficult to stalk you. I couldn\u2019t even find you on Facebook.\u201d</p><p>She smiles again. I hate that I\u2019m keeping count. Three.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not on Facebook,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t have internet access.\u201d</p> <p>I can\u2019t tell if she\u2019s lying to let me off easily, or if she\u2019s actually being honest about not having internet access. I don\u2019t know which one is harder to believe. \u201cWhat about your phone? You can\u2019t get internet on your phone?\u201d</p><p>She lifts her arms to tighten her ponytail and I feel like I\u2019m the one out of breath right now. \u201cNo phone. My mother isn\u2019t a fan of modern technology. No TV, either.\u201d</p><p>I wait for her to laugh, but it\u2019s obvious in just a few short seconds that she\u2019s completely serious. This isn\u2019t good. How the hell am I supposed to get in touch with her? Not that I need to. I just have a pretty good feeling I\u2019ll want to. \u201cShit.\u201d I laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re serious? What do you do for fun?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cI run.\u201d</p><p>Yes, she certainly does. And if I have anything to do with it, she won\u2019t be running alone, anymore.</p><p>\u201cWell in that case,\u201d I say, leaning toward her, \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t happen to know what time a certain someone gets up for her morning runs, would you?\u201d</p><p>She sucks in a quick breath, then attempts to control it with a smile. Three and a half.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019d want to get up that early,\u201d she says.</p><p>If she only knew I would go so far as to never sleep again if she would just agree to run with me. I lean in a little closer and lower my voice. \u201cYou have no idea how bad I want to get up that early.\u201d</p><p>As soon as her fourth smile appears, she disappears. It happens so fast, I don\u2019t even have time to react. The sound she makes when she smacks the pavement makes me wince. I immediately kneel down and roll her over.</p><p>\u201cSky?\u201d I say, shaking her. She\u2019s out cold. I look toward her house, then scoop her up and rush her to the door. I don\u2019t bother knocking, since I have no extra hands. I lift my foot and kick at the front door, hoping someone is home to let me in.</p><p>Within seconds, the front door swings open and a woman appears. She looks at me in utter confusion until she recognizes Sky in my arms.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God!\u201d She immediately opens the door to let me in.</p><p>\u201cShe passed out in the driveway,\u201d I say. \u201cI think she\u2019s dehydrated.\u201d</p><p>The woman immediately runs to the kitchen while I lower Sky onto the living room sofa. As soon as her head meets the arm of the couch, she moans and her eyelids flutter open. I breathe a sigh of relief, then step aside when her mother reappears.</p><p>\u201cSky, drink some water,\u201d she says. She helps her take a sip, then she sets the glass of water down. \u201cI\u2019ll get you a cold rag,\u201d she says, walking toward the hallway.</p><p>Sky looks up at me and winces. I kneel next to her, feeling awful that I just let her fall like that. It happened so fast, though. One second she was standing in front of me; the next second she wasn\u2019t. \u201cYou sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d I ask after her mother has left the room. \u201cThat was a pretty nasty fall.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s gravel and dirt stuck to her cheek, so I wipe most of it away. She squeezes her eyes shut and throws her arm over her face.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d she groans. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. This is so embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>I take her wrist and pull it away from her face. The last thing I want her to feel is embarrassed. I\u2019m just thankful she\u2019s okay. And even more thankful it gave me an excuse to carry her inside. Now I\u2019m inside her house with an excuse to come back and check on her this week. Things couldn\u2019t have worked out better for me.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d I whisper. \u201cI\u2019m sort of enjoying it.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth curls up into a smile. Five.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s you a rag, sweetie. Do you want something for the pain? Are you nauseous?\u201d Her mother hands me the rag and walks to the kitchen. \u201cI might have some calendula or burdock root.\u201d</p><p>Sky rolls her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Mom. Nothing hurts.\u201d</p><p>I wipe the rest of the dirt off her cheek with the rag. \u201cYou might not be sore now, but you will be,\u201d I say quietly. She didn\u2019t see how hard she hit the ground. She\u2019ll definitely feel it tomorrow. \u201cYou should take something, just in case.\u201d</p><p>She nods and attempts to sit up, so I assist her. Her mother walks back into the room with a small glass of juice and hands it to Sky.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she says, extending her hand out to me. \u201cI\u2019m Karen Davis.\u201d</p><p>I stand up and return the handshake. \u201cDean Holder,\u201d I say, taking a quick glance at Sky. \u201cMy friends call me Holder.\u201d</p><p>Karen smiles. \u201cHow do you and Sky know each other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t, actually,\u201d I say. \u201cJust in the right place at the right time, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thank you for helping her. I don\u2019t know why she fainted. She\u2019s never fainted.\u201d She turns her attention to Sky. \u201cDid you eat anything today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bite of chicken for lunch,\u201d Sky says. \u201cCafeteria food sucks ass.\u201d</p><p>Cafeteria food. So she goes to public school. I might just be rethinking my educational decision after all.</p><p>Karen rolls her eyes and throws her hands up in the air. \u201cWhy were you running without eating first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forgot,\u201d Sky says defensively. \u201cI don\u2019t usually run in the evenings.\u201d</p><p>Karen walks back to the kitchen with the glass and sighs heavily. \u201cI don\u2019t want you running anymore, Sky. What would have happened if you had been by yourself? You run too much, anyway.\u201d</p><p>The look on Sky\u2019s face is priceless. Apparently running is as vital to her as breathing.</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d I say, finding an opportunity to appease all parties involved, especially myself. \u201cI live right over on Ricker and I run by here every day on my afternoon runs. If you\u2019d feel more comfortable, I\u2019d be happy to run with her for the next week or so in the mornings. I usually run the track at school, but it\u2019s not a big deal. You know, just to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>Karen returns to the living room and eyes both of us. \u201cI\u2019m okay with that,\u201d she says. She turns her attention to Sky. \u201cIf Sky thinks it\u2019s a good idea.\u201d</p><p>Please think it\u2019s a good idea.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Sky says with a shrug.</p><p>I was hoping for a \u201cHell yes,\u201d but \u201cfine\u201d will suffice.</p><p>She attempts to stand up again, but she sways to the left. I immediately reach out and grab her arm to ease her back down onto the sofa.</p><p>\u201cEasy,\u201d I say to her. I look at Karen. \u201cDo you have any crackers she can eat? That might help.\u201d</p><p>Karen walks away to the kitchen and I give Sky my full attention again. \u201cYou sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d I run my thumb over her cheek for no reason at all other than the simple fact that I wanted to touch her cheek again. As soon as my fingers graze her skin, chills rush down her arms. She tightens her arms over her chest and rubs the chills away. I can\u2019t help but grin, knowing it was my hand on her skin that did that to her. Best. Feeling. Ever.</p><p>I glance at Karen to make sure she\u2019s not making her way back into the living room, then I lean in toward Sky. \u201cWhat time should I come stalk you tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix-thirty?\u201d She says breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cSix-thirty sounds good.\u201d Six-thirty is my new favorite time of day.</p><p>\u201cHolder, you don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d She looks me directly in the eyes as if she wants to give me the opportunity to back out. Why the hell would I want to back out?</p><p>\u201cI know I don\u2019t have to do this, Sky. I do what I want.\u201d I lean even closer, hoping to see the chills run down her arms again. \u201cAnd I want to run with you.\u201d</p><p>I pull away just as Karen is walking back into the living room. Sky keeps her eyes focused hard on mine and it makes me wish more than anything that it was tomorrow morning already.</p><p>\u201cEat,\u201d Karen says, placing crackers in Sky\u2019s hand.</p><p>I stand up and tell Karen good-bye. \u201cTake care of yourself,\u201d I say to Sky as I back my way toward the front door. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in the morning?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She nods and it\u2019s all the confirmation I need. I pull the door shut behind me as I leave, pleased that I somehow managed to redeem myself. As soon as I\u2019m out of her driveway and back on the sidewalk, I pull my phone from my pocket and call Daniel.</p><p>\u201cHey, Hopeless,\u201d he says when he answers.</p><p>\u201cI said stop calling me that, Jackass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoulda thought about that before you got the tattoo,\u201d he quips back. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSky Davis,\u201d I say quickly. \u201cWho is she, where\u2019s she from, does she go to school here and is she dating Grayson?\u201d</p><p>Daniel laughs. \u201cWhoa, buddy. Slow down. First of all, I\u2019ve never met her. Second of all, if that\u2019s the same Sky that I claimed to have deflowered in front of Val at that party the other night, there\u2019s no way I\u2019m asking around about her. I\u2019m still trying to convince Val I never really slept with the chick. Asking people about her will only make it worse for me, man.\u201d</p><p>I groan. \u201cDaniel, please. I need to know and you\u2019re better with this shit than I am.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a long pause on his end. \u201cFine,\u201d he says. \u201cBut on one condition.\u201d</p><p>I knew there\u2019d be a condition. There\u2019s always a condition when it comes to Daniel. \u201cWhat condition?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou come to school tomorrow. Just one day. Enroll tomorrow and try it for one day and if you absolutely hate it you can officially drop out with my blessing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal,\u201d I say immediately. I can do one day. Especially if Sky will be there.</p><p>Chapter Eight-and-a-half</p><p>Les,</p><p>Holy shit, Les. HOLY. SHIT.</p><p>It feels like forever since I wrote to you but it was just this morning. So much has happened, my hands are shaking and I can barely write.</p> <p>I still haven\u2019t talked to Mom about dropping out yet, but only because I\u2019m not so sure I want to drop out anymore. We\u2019ll see after tomorrow.</p><p>Are you sitting down for this? Sit your ass down, Les.</p><p>I.</p><p>Found.</p><p>Hope.</p><p>But I didn\u2019t.</p><p>Well, I\u2019m still not so sure I didn\u2019t, but I\u2019m more sure that she isn\u2019t Hope than sure that she is. Does that even make sense? I mean, the second I saw her I was positive it was her. But when I realized she didn\u2019t recognize me, I thought maybe I was wrong or she was pretending or . . . I don\u2019t know. I just started doubting myself. Then I acted sort of stalkerish and crazy so she showed me her ID, which was really dumb of her if you consider how stalkerish I was acting. But her ID proved she wasn\u2019t Hope, which crushed me, but only for a couple of hours. Because when I went running I ran into her again thanks to fate or coincidence or divine intervention or maybe you had something to do with it. Whatever or whoever made it happen, she was there, standing in front of our house, looking all beautiful and shit. Jesus, she looked good, Les.</p><p>I\u2019m sure you want to hear that, right?</p> <p>Anyway, so I\u2019m convinced now that if she really is Hope, she would have remembered me. Especially after I told her mother that my name was Dean Holder. I glanced down at Sky to see if my first name rang a bell but based on her lack of reaction, it didn\u2019t ring a bell at all, so there\u2019s no way she could be the same girl.</p><p>Do you want to know the strangest part, Les? The part of this entire day that has thrown me for the biggest loop?</p><p>I don\u2019t even want her to be Hope.</p><p>If she\u2019s Hope, all of the drama and the stress and the media attention would surround us again and I don\u2019t want that for her. This girl seems happy and healthy and not at all how I expected our Hope to be if we ever found her. So I\u2019m glad Sky isn\u2019t Hope and Hope isn\u2019t Sky.</p><p>I had Daniel do some investigating and I learned a little bit about her. She\u2019s lived in this area for years and has been homeschooled by her mom, who seems really nice, by the way.</p><p>Daniel also said she\u2019s not officially dating Grayson, so that\u2019s a plus. I\u2019m still not sure how she\u2019s connected to him, because according to Daniel she\u2019s definitely connected to him in some way. I\u2019m hoping to stop that before it becomes anything significant, though.</p><p>Sorry I\u2019m rambling. It\u2019s just been the type of day you don\u2019t expect at all when you wake up for it. I\u2019ll let you know how tomorrow goes. I owe Daniel a day of school.</p><p>P.S. Sky had a black eye today. She never said what actually happened, but you know how paranoid I am about anything remotely connected to Grayson. I\u2019ll never forget that day you came home with those bruises on your arm, Les. You begged me not to kill him because I swear to you, I would have if you hadn\u2019t sworn that he didn\u2019t do it.</p><p>I don\u2019t know if you were telling the truth when you said it happened during your athletics class. I don\u2019t know if Grayson is capable of doing something like that. But seeing Sky with that bruise under her eye had me just as worked up as when I thought Grayson had hurt you. And you aren\u2019t here for me to protect anymore, so I feel this unrelenting need to protect Sky and I don\u2019t even know her.</p><p>Don\u2019t tell Daniel this, not that you could, but I would have shown up to school tomorrow whether he made it a condition or not. I need to see how Sky and Grayson interact with my own two eyes so I can determine whether I actually need to kill him this time.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>I\u2019m ten minutes early when I reach her house, so I take a seat on the curb and stretch. After leaving here yesterday, I felt like me offering to run with her might have been a little forward. It is out of my way and I don\u2019t usually run this much in a day, but I didn\u2019t know how else I would see her again.</p><p>I hear her walking up behind me, so I spin around and stand up. \u201cHey, you.\u201d</p><p>I expect her to smile or return a greeting of some sort, but instead she eyes me up and down with an uncomfortable frown. I shrug it off, hoping she\u2019s just not a morning person.</p><p>\u201cYou need to stretch first?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cAlready did.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m curious if the solemn attitude is because she\u2019s sore from her fall yesterday. Her black eye is still prominently displayed, but her cheek doesn\u2019t look as bad as I thought it would. I reach out and run my thumb over the scrape on her face. \u201cDoesn\u2019t look so bad. You sore?\u201d She shakes her head no. \u201cGood. You ready?\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Three words is all the conversation I get from her? She turns and we both begin running in silence. I\u2019ve never run with a girl before but I expected there to be a little more back and forth. I can\u2019t tell from the guarded greeting we just had in her front yard if she\u2019s uncomfortable around me, or if the quietness is actually a sign of comfort. It could go either way.</p><p>The tension lessens once I fall into step behind her. It\u2019s easier to get away with not speaking when I\u2019m not running side by side with her. I just have no idea what to say. I\u2019m not much of a talker to begin with, but being in her presence suppresses the conversational side of me even more. I guess if I really want to get anywhere with her, I need to suck it up. I speed up and step back into stride with her.</p><p>\u201cYou better try out for track,\u201d I say. \u201cYou\u2019ve got more stamina than most of the guys from the team last year.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head and continues to focus on the sidewalk in front of us. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I want to,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t really know anyone at school. I planned on trying out, but so far most of the people at school are sort of . . . mean. I don\u2019t really want to be subjected to them for longer periods of time under the guise of a team.\u201d</p><p>I hate that she\u2019s been in school for a day and she already knows how mean everyone is. I wonder what the hell they did to make her first day so bad?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve only been in public school for a day. Give it time. You can\u2019t expect to be homeschooled your whole life, then walk in the first day with a ton of new friends.\u201d</p><p>I feel bad telling her the exact opposite of what I really feel. If I was being completely honest, I\u2019d tell her to go back to homeschooling, because she had it made before she entered public school. I turn to look at her but she\u2019s not running next to me. I spin around and she is stopped several feet behind me with her hands on her hips. I rush to her.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay? Are you dizzy?\u201d I hold her shoulders in case she feels faint again. I\u2019d feel like the ultimate jackass if I just let her bust the pavement like I did yesterday.</p><p>She shakes her head no, then pushes my hands off her shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she says.</p><p>She\u2019s pissed about something. I try to think of what I might have said, but nothing seemed offensive. \u201cDid I say something wrong?\u201d</p><p>She drops her eyes to the pavement and starts walking again, so I follow her. \u201cA little,\u201d she says with a miffed tone. \u201cI was halfway joking about the stalking yesterday, but you admitted to looking me up on Facebook right after meeting me. Then you insist on running with me, even though it\u2019s out of your way. Now you somehow know how long I\u2019ve been in public school? And that I was homeschooled? I\u2019m not gonna lie, it\u2019s a little unnerving.\u201d</p><p>Shit. What the hell is wrong with me? How do I admit that I learned most of what I know about her based on overhearing Grayson at a party and through speculative rumors from Daniel? She doesn\u2019t need to know that. I don\u2019t want her to know that.</p><p>I sigh and continue walking toward her house with her. \u201cI asked around,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ve lived here since I was ten, so I have a lot of friends. I was curious about you.\u201d</p><p>She focuses on me as if she\u2019s trying to figure out how I know so much about her. I\u2019m not about to admit the things I overheard Grayson say, because I don\u2019t want to hurt her. But I also don\u2019t want to admit that I begged Daniel for more information, because I don\u2019t want to scare her off. But based on the skeptical look spread across her face, she\u2019s already formed a good amount of distrust in me.</p><p>I take her by the elbow and she stops walking. I turn her so that she\u2019s facing me.</p><p>\u201cSky. I think we got off on the wrong foot at the store yesterday. And the talk about stalking, I swear, it was a joke. I don\u2019t want you to feel uncomfortable around me. Would it make you feel better if you knew more about me? Ask me something and I\u2019ll tell you. Anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I ask you something, will you be honest?\u201d</p><p>I look her hard in the eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019ll ever be,\u201d I say. And I intend to be completely honest with her, unless I think it\u2019ll hurt her.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you drop out of school?\u201d</p><p>I sigh, wishing she had asked me something a little less complicated. I should have known things wouldn\u2019t be simple with her, though.</p><p>I start walking again. \u201cTechnically, I haven\u2019t dropped out yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell you obviously haven\u2019t been in over a year. I\u2019d say that\u2019s dropping out.\u201d</p><p>That comment makes me curious if she\u2019s heard the rumors about me. Of course I\u2019ve been to school in the past year, it just wasn\u2019t this one. But she didn\u2019t ask about the rumored stint in juvi, so I\u2019m not going to offer up unnecessary information. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI just moved back home a few days ago,\u201d I say. \u201cMy mother and I had a pretty shitty year last year, so I moved in with my dad in Austin for a while. I\u2019ve been going to school there, but felt like it was time to come back home. So here I am.\u201d</p><p>She squints like she\u2019s trying to scowl at me, but the expression she makes is too adorable to find intimidating. I keep my smile in check, though, because I can tell she\u2019s taking this school thing seriously. \u201cNone of that explains why you decided to drop out, rather than just transfer back.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s right, but only because I really don\u2019t know the answer to her question.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. To be honest, I\u2019m still trying to decide what I want to do. It\u2019s been a pretty fucked-up year. Not to mention I hate this school. I\u2019m tired of the bullshit and sometimes I think it would be easier to just test out.\u201d</p> <p>She stops dead in her tracks again and glares at me. \u201cThat\u2019s a crap excuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s crap that I hate high school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s crap that you\u2019re letting one bad year determine your fate for the rest of your life. You\u2019re nine months away from graduation, so you drop out? It\u2019s just . . . it\u2019s stupid.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s really taking this seriously. I laugh, even though I\u2019m trying really hard not to. \u201cWell, when you put it so eloquently.\u201d</p><p>She crosses her arms and huffs. \u201cLaugh all you want. You quitting school is just giving in. You\u2019re proving everyone that\u2019s ever doubted you right.\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes drop to the tattoo on my arm. I\u2019ve never wanted to hide it until this moment, but something about her reading it seems like an invasion of privacy in a way. Maybe because I was so certain yesterday that she was half the reason for the tattoo on my arm. But now that I know she\u2019s not, I really don\u2019t want her asking about it. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna drop out and show the world just how hopeless you really are? Way to stick it to \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>I look down at the tattoo. She has no idea what the meaning is behind it and I realize that. But her assumption that it means anything other than what it means sort of pisses me off. I don\u2019t want to explain it to her and I certainly don\u2019t want to be judged by someone who seems to be receiving her own fair share of judgments. Rather than stick around and allow her to decipher me even more, I nudge my head toward her house. \u201cYou\u2019re here,\u201d I say flatly. I turn around and head toward home without looking back at her. No need to get too detailed with her, anyway, until I find out more about her relationship with Grayson. And in order to do that, I need to hurry up and get back to my house so I can shower and change in time for my first and possibly only day of senior year.</p><p>This is a large school, which is why I didn\u2019t expect to actually have a class with her, much less the first one. And with Mr. Mulligan, to top it off.</p><p>She didn\u2019t seem too happy to see me, either. And the fact that she just practically ran past me to get out of the classroom doesn\u2019t seem to bode well. I pick up my textbook and make my way out of the classroom. Rather than search for my next class, I head straight to find her, instead.</p><p>She\u2019s facing her locker, switching books. I walk up behind her but pause for a moment before speaking to her. I want to give her a chance to get what she needs from her locker, because I\u2019m hoping I\u2019ll be walking her to her next class.</p><p>\u201cHey, you,\u201d I say optimistically. There\u2019s a pause.</p> <p>\u201cYou came,\u201d she says, her voice cool and composed. She turns around to face me and just seeing her eyes again makes me smile. I lean against the locker next to hers and tilt my head against the cold metal. I eye her outfit for a second, taking in the fact that she somehow looks even better after a shower.</p><p>\u201cYou clean up nice. Although, the sweaty version of you isn\u2019t so bad, either,\u201d I say, smiling at her. I\u2019m trying to ease some of the tension rolling off her, but nothing seems to be working in my favor.</p><p>\u201cAre you here stalking me or did you actually re-enroll?\u201d she asks.</p><p>A joke. She made a joke.</p><p>\u201cBoth,\u201d I say, tapping my fingers against the metal. I\u2019m still smiling at her but she won\u2019t maintain eye contact with me for more than two seconds. She shifts her feet and looks nervously around us.</p><p>\u201cWell, I need to get to class,\u201d she says, her voice monotone. \u201cWelcome back.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s being weird. \u201cYou\u2019re being weird.\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes and turns back to her locker. \u201cI\u2019m just surprised to see you here,\u201d she says unconvincingly.</p> <p>\u201cNope,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s something else. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>My persistence seems to be paying off because she sighs and presses her back against the locker and looks up at me. \u201cYou want me to be honest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I ever want you to be.\u201d</p><p>She purses her lips together. \u201cFine,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to give you the wrong idea. You flirt and say things like you have intentions with me that I\u2019m not willing to reciprocate. And you\u2019re . . .\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t want to give me the wrong idea? Who is this and what the hell did she do with the girl who was blatantly flirting with me last night? I narrow my eyes at her. \u201cI\u2019m what?\u201d I say, challenging her to finish her thought.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re . . . intense. Too intense. And moody. And a little bit scary. And there\u2019s the other thing . . . I just don\u2019t want you getting the wrong idea.\u201d</p><p>And there it is. She\u2019s been fed the lies and now I\u2019m left to have to defend myself to the one person I incorrectly assumed might empathize with me.</p><p>\u201cWhat other thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d she says, darting her eyes to the floor.</p><p>I take a step toward her and place my hand against the locker beside her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know, because you\u2019re skirting around whatever issue it is you have with me like you\u2019re too afraid to say it. Just say it.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes grow wide and I immediately feel guilty for being so harsh with her. It just frustrates me no end that she would feed into their bullshit. The same bullshit that surrounds her.</p><p>\u201cI heard about what you did,\u201d she blurts out. \u201cI know about the guy you beat up. I know about you being sent to juvi. I know that in the two days I\u2019ve known you, you\u2019ve scared the shit out of me at least three times. And since we\u2019re being honest, I also know that if you\u2019ve been asking around about me, then you\u2019ve probably heard about my reputation, which is more than likely the only reason you\u2019re even making an effort with me. I hate to disappoint you, but I\u2019m not screwing you. I don\u2019t want you thinking anything will happen between us besides what\u2019s already happening. We run together. That\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>Wow.</p><p>I was expecting her to hear the rumors about me, but I wasn\u2019t expecting her to think I believe the rumors about her. So that\u2019s why her guard is up? Because she thinks I heard the rumors and now I\u2019m just trying to screw her?</p><p>I mean, don\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019m not saying the thought hasn\u2019t crossed my mind. But Jesus, not like that. The fact that she even feels this way only makes me want to hug her. The thought of anyone intentionally trying to get close to her for that sole reason pisses me off. It doesn\u2019t help matters that Grayson is standing next to her now.</p><p>Where the hell did he come from? And why the hell does he have his arm around her like he owns her?</p><p>\u201cHolder,\u201d Grayson says. \u201cDidn\u2019t know you were coming back.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019re the first words he\u2019s spoken directly to me since the night before Les died. I\u2019m afraid if I look at him I\u2019ll lose it, so I keep my eyes trained hard on Sky\u2019s. Unfortunately, my eyes can\u2019t seem to stop looking at the hand that\u2019s still gripping her waist. The hand that Sky hasn\u2019t slapped away. The hand that has obviously been around that same waist before. The same hand that used to be around Les.</p><p>This entire situation is too ironic. So much so, I crack a smile. Just my luck.</p><p>I straighten up and keep my eyes locked on the hand around Sky\u2019s waist. \u201cWell, I\u2019m back,\u201d I say. I can\u2019t watch this for another second. That familiar feeling of wanting to rip his fucking hand off has returned tenfold.</p><p>I walk away and make it a few feet down the hall before I turn around and face Sky again. \u201cTrack tryouts are Thursday after school. Go.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t wait for her response. I walk to my locker and exchange books, then head to my next class. I don\u2019t know why, though. I\u2019m pretty sure I won\u2019t be coming back tomorrow.</p><p>\u201cHey, dickweed. What\u2019s this sudden infatuation with Sky?\u201d Daniel asks as we make our way toward the cafeteria.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d I say, attempting to brush it off. \u201cI met her yesterday and was just curious about her. But apparently she\u2019s with Grayson, so . . . whatever.\u201d</p><p>Daniel raises an eyebrow, but says nothing about the Grayson comment. He pushes through the cafeteria doors and we walk to our table. I take a seat and scan the crowd, searching for her.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna eat today?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNah. I don\u2019t really feel like it.\u201d I lost my appetite this morning as soon as Grayson\u2019s arm went around Sky\u2019s waist.</p><p>Daniel shrugs and walks away to get himself food. I search the cafeteria a while longer and finally spot her a few tables down, sitting with a guy. He\u2019s not Grayson, though. I scan the crowd for Grayson and find him seated at a table on the opposite end of the cafeteria. They\u2019re not sitting together. Why wouldn\u2019t they sit together if they\u2019re dating? And if they\u2019re not dating, why would he be touching her like he was?</p><p>\u201cI got you a water,\u201d Daniel says, sliding it across the table to me.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>He sets his tray down and takes a seat across from me. \u201cWhy are you being such a cunt nugget?\u201d</p><p>Water spews out of my mouth and I drop my arms onto the table and laugh, wiping my mouth. \u201cCunt nugget?\u201d</p><p>He nods and pops the lid on his soda. \u201cSomething\u2019s off with you. You stared at that girl the entire time I was in line for food. You won\u2019t tell me anything about her. You\u2019ve been on edge since you got here this morning and it has nothing to do with the fact that it\u2019s your first day back at school since . . . well . . . since your last day at school. And you haven\u2019t even commented about how no one seems to give a shit that you\u2019re even here today. Aren\u2019t you a little excited everyone has stopped with the gossip?\u201d</p><p>I would be excited if I was convinced the gossip had stopped. But it hasn\u2019t stopped, it\u2019s just been shifted in a different direction. I heard Sky\u2019s name mentioned in every single class I\u2019ve had today. Not to mention the shit I\u2019ve seen slapped on her locker in the form of sticky-notes.</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t stop with the gossip, Daniel. They just found someone new to target.\u201d</p><p>Daniel starts to reply, but he\u2019s cut off by several trays dropping down onto the table. Guys slide into seats and several of them welcome me back, going on about how I made it right in time for football season. That leads into a conversation about practices and Coach Riley, but none of it can hold my attention like she does. I ignore everyone around me and watch her, still trying to figure her out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I honestly don\u2019t want to impede if she\u2019s dating Grayson. If she\u2019s happy with him, then fine. Good for them. But I\u2019ll be damned if I don\u2019t get to the bottom of what happened to her eye. I need a straight explanation from her before I can let it go. Otherwise, I\u2019ll be going to Grayson to find out what happened to her eye, and I know how that\u2019ll end.</p><p>The guy she\u2019s sitting with nods in my direction when he sees me staring at them. I make it a point not to turn away, because I actually want to get her attention. When she looks at me, I nudge my head toward the cafeteria doors, then stand up and walk toward them.</p><p>I walk out into the hallway, hoping she\u2019ll follow me. I know it\u2019s not my business, but if I expect to make it through the rest of the day without murdering Grayson, I have to know the truth. I walk around the corner for more privacy and lean back against the row of lockers. She walks around the corner and spots me, then comes to a stop.</p><p>\u201cAre you dating Grayson?\u201d I ask. I keep it short and sweet. She doesn\u2019t seem to like having conversations with me, so I don\u2019t want to force her to do something she doesn\u2019t want to do. I just want the truth so I can justify my next move.</p> <p>She rolls her eyes and walks to the lockers across from me, leaning against them to face me. \u201cDoes it matter?\u201d</p><p>Hmm. It shouldn\u2019t matter, but it does. I have no idea what kind of person she is, but Grayson doesn\u2019t deserve her. So yes, it does matter.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an asshole,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cSometimes you are, too,\u201d she bites back.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not good for you.\u201d</p> <p>She laughs and rolls her eyes toward the ceiling, shaking her head. \u201cAnd you are?\u201d</p><p>I groan. She\u2019s missing my point completely. I turn around to face the lockers and hit one of them with an open palm, releasing some of the frustration she\u2019s causing me with her stubbornness. When the sound echoes through the hallway I cringe. That came off a little harsher than I meant for it to.</p><p>But I am angry and I hate that I\u2019m angry because I shouldn\u2019t even give a shit. Les isn\u2019t around for Grayson to fuck over, so why do I care?</p><p>Because I don\u2019t want her with him. That\u2019s why.</p><p>I turn around and face her again. \u201cDon\u2019t factor me into this. I\u2019m talking about Grayson, not me. You shouldn\u2019t be with him. You have no idea what kind of person he is.\u201d</p><p>She rolls her head back against the locker, fed up with me. \u201cTwo days, Holder. I\u2019ve known you all of two days,\u201d she says. She kicks off the lockers and walks toward me, eyeing me angrily. \u201cIn those two days, I\u2019ve seen five different sides of you, and only one of them has been appealing. The fact that you think you have any right to even voice an opinion about me or my decisions is absurd. It\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d</p> <p>I inhale through my nose and exhale through my clenched teeth, because I\u2019m pissed. Pissed that she\u2019s right. She\u2019s seen me go from hot to cold more than once over these past two days and I haven\u2019t given her a single explanation. She deserves an explanation for my oddly overprotective behavior, so I attempt to give her one.</p><p>I take a step toward her. \u201cI don\u2019t like him. And when I see things like this?\u201d I bring my fingers up to trace the bruise underneath her eye. \u201cAnd then see him with his arm around you? Forgive me if I get a little ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>The moment my fingers finish tracing the bruise, I fail to remove them from her cheek. Her breath hitches and her eyes grow wider and I can\u2019t help but notice the obvious reaction she has to my touch. I have an overwhelming urge to run my hand through her hair and pull her mouth to mine, but she pulls away from me and takes a step back.</p><p>\u201cYou think I should stay away from Grayson because you\u2019re afraid he has a temper?\u201d She narrows her eyes and tilts her head. \u201cA bit hypocritical, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>I keep my eyes locked on hers as I process her comment. She\u2019s comparing me to Grayson?</p><p>I have to turn away from her so she doesn\u2019t see the disappointment on my face. I grip the back of my neck with both hands, then slowly turn back around to face her, but I keep my eyes trained on the floor.</p><p>\u201cDid he hit you,\u201d I say with a defeated sigh. I look back up at her and directly into her eyes. \u201cHas he ever hit you?\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t flinch or look away. She just shakes her head. \u201cNo,\u201d she says softly. \u201cAnd no. I told you . . . it was an accident.\u201d</p> <p>I can tell by her reaction that she\u2019s telling the truth. He didn\u2019t hit her. He never hit her, and I\u2019m more than relieved. But still confused. If she\u2019s not dating him and he really didn\u2019t hit her, then what\u2019s her connection to him? Does she want to date him? Because I sure as hell don\u2019t want her to.</p><p>The bell rings right when I open my mouth to ask her what her relationship is with Grayson. The hallway fills with students and she breaks eye contact with me, then walks back toward the cafeteria.</p><p>I haven\u2019t seen Daniel again. I also didn\u2019t have another class with Sky, which disappoints me. I don\u2019t know why, though. We can\u2019t seem to have a conversation without it ending in an argument, but that doesn\u2019t stop me from wanting to have another conversation with her.</p><p>I leave my books in my locker, still not sure if I\u2019ll be back tomorrow. I grab my keys and walk toward the parking lot. I\u2019m several feet from my car when I look up and see Grayson leaning against it. I stop and assess the situation. He\u2019s eyeing me coldly, but he\u2019s alone. Not sure what he wants or why he\u2019s touching my car.</p><p>\u201cGrayson, whatever it is, I\u2019m not interested. Just let it go.\u201d I\u2019m not in the mood for him right now and he really needs to get the hell off my car.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d he says, pushing off the car with his foot. He folds his arms across his chest and walks toward me. \u201cI really wish I could just let it go, Holder. But for some reason you seem so focused on my business, you really make it impossible for me to let it go.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s within reach of my fist now, which isn\u2019t very smart of him. I keep my eyes locked on his, but watch his hands out of my peripheral vision.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been back less than a day and you\u2019re already at it again,\u201d he says, stupidly walking even closer to me. \u201cSky is off-limits to you, Holder. Don\u2019t talk to her. Don\u2019t look at her.\u201d I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m still allowing him to speak. \u201cDon\u2019t go fucking near her. The last thing I need is for another one of my girlfriend\u2019s to kill herself because of you.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m in that moment.</p><p>The moment when rational thought is drowned out by anger.</p><p>The moment when a person\u2019s conscience is stifled by rage.</p><p>The moment when the vision of releasing every pent-up feeling I\u2019ve had for thirteen months surfaces, and it actually feels good. His face would feel so good against my fist right now and the thought of it makes me smile as I clench my fists and inhale a breath.</p><p>But Grayson quickly becomes an afterthought when I look over his shoulder and see Sky across the parking lot, climbing into her car. She doesn\u2019t even glance around the parking lot to look for Grayson. She just climbs into her car, shuts her door, and leaves.</p><p>It\u2019s in that moment that I realize he\u2019s full of shit.</p><p>They weren\u2019t sitting together at lunch.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t at the party with him Saturday night.</p><p>She\u2019s not waiting for him after school.</p><p>She\u2019s not even looking for him in the parking lot right now.</p><p>Everything falls into place as Grayson takes a step back, gauging my reaction, waiting for me to take his bait. Sky doesn\u2019t care about him. That\u2019s why he\u2019s so pissed that I was talking to her in the hallway. She doesn\u2019t give a shit about him and he doesn\u2019t want me to know that.</p><p>He\u2019s not worth it, I repeat to myself.</p><p>I watch as Sky pulls out of the parking lot, then I slowly refocus my gaze on Grayson. I\u2019m oddly calm after coming to this new realization, but his jaw is clenched tighter than his fists. He wants me to fight him. He wants me to get kicked out of school.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t deserve to get a single damn thing he wants.</p><p>I raise my arm. His eyes dart to my hand and he puts his own hands up in defense. I point the clicker toward my car and press the button, unlocking my doors. I silently walk around him and climb into my car, then pull out of the parking lot without giving him the reaction he was hoping for.</p><p>Fuck him. He\u2019s not worth it.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>I open the refrigerator door because I\u2019m starving, but I haven\u2019t had anything to eat in over thirteen months. I haven\u2019t taken a single bite of food since Les died and it\u2019s weird that I\u2019m still alive after all this time.</p><p>It takes the refrigerator light a second to kick on, even after I have the door open. As soon as the contents of the refrigerator are illuminated, I\u2019m immediately disappointed. Every single shelf is stuffed with Les\u2019s jeans. They\u2019re all folded neatly on the shelves of the refrigerator and it pisses me off because this is where the food should be and I\u2019m fucking hungry.</p><p>I open one of the crisper drawers, hoping the food is hidden in there, but there\u2019s no food. Just another pair of neatly folded jeans. I shut it and open the other crisper drawer and her jeans are in there, too.</p><p>How many fucking pairs of jeans does she need? And why are they in the refrigerator where the food is supposed to be?</p><p>I close the refrigerator door and open the freezer, but I\u2019m met with the same thing, only this time the jeans are frozen. They\u2019re all in freezer bags labeled \u201cLes\u2019s jeans.\u201d I slam the freezer door shut, irritated, and turn toward the pantry, hoping to find something to eat in there.</p><p>I walk around the kitchen island and look down.</p><p>I see her.</p><p>I squeeze my eyes shut and open them again, but she\u2019s still there.</p><p>Les is huddled in a fetal position on the kitchen floor, her back pressed up against the pantry door.</p><p>This makes no sense.</p><p>How is she here?</p><p>She\u2019s been dead for thirteen months.</p><p>I\u2019m hungry.</p><p>\u201cDean,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>Her eyes flick open and I immediately have to reach my hand out in order to steady myself against the island. My body suddenly becomes too heavy to hold up and I take a small step back, right before my legs give out and I fall to my knees in front of her.</p><p>Her eyes are open wide now and they\u2019re completely gray. No pupil, no irises. Just glossed-over gray eyes that are searching for me, unable to find me.</p><p>\u201cDean,\u201d she says again in a hoarse whisper. She blindly reaches her arm out toward me and her fingers feel around in front of her.</p><p>I want to help her. I want to reach out and grab her hand but I\u2019m too weak to move. Or my body weighs too much. I don\u2019t know what it is that\u2019s stopping me, but I\u2019m only two feet in front of her and I\u2019m doing everything I can to lift my arm and take her hand but it won\u2019t fucking move. The more I struggle to regain control over my movements, the harder it becomes to breathe. She\u2019s crying now, saying my name. My chest tightens and my throat begins to close up and now I can\u2019t even calm her down with words because nothing will come out. I work the muscles in my jaw, but my teeth are clenched tight and my mouth won\u2019t open. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019s pulling herself up on her elbow, slowly scooting closer to me. She\u2019s trying to reach out for me but her lifeless eyes can\u2019t find me. She\u2019s crying even harder now.</p><p>\u201cHelp me, Dean,\u201d she says.</p><p>She hasn\u2019t called me Dean since we were kids and I don\u2019t know why she\u2019s calling me Dean now. I don\u2019t like it.</p><p>I squeeze my eyes shut and try to focus on getting my voice to work or my arms to move, but all the concentration in the world can\u2019t help me right now.</p> <p>\u201cDean, please,\u201d she cries, only this time it\u2019s not her voice. It\u2019s the voice of a child. \u201cDon\u2019t go,\u201d the child begs.</p><p>I open my eyes and Les is no longer there, but someone else has taken her place. A little girl is sitting with her back pressed against the pantry door and her head is buried in her arms that are wrapped tightly around her legs.</p><p>Hope.</p><p>I still can\u2019t move or speak or breathe and my chest is growing tighter and tighter with each sob that racks the little girl\u2019s body. All I can do is sit and watch her cry, because I\u2019m physically unable to even turn my head or close my eyes.</p><p>\u201cDean,\u201d she says, her voice muffled by her arms and her tears. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve heard her say my name since the day she was taken and it knocks out what little breath I had left in me. She slowly lifts her head away from her arms and widens her eyes. They\u2019re solid gray, identical to Les\u2019s. She leans her head back against the pantry door and wipes away a tear with the back of her hand.</p> <p>\u201cYou found me,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>Only this time, it\u2019s not the voice of the little girl anymore. It\u2019s not even Les\u2019s voice.</p><p>It\u2019s Sky\u2019s.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>I open my eyes and I\u2019m no longer on the kitchen floor.</p><p>I\u2019m in my bed.</p> <p>I\u2019m covered in sweat.</p><p>I\u2019m gasping for air.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>I couldn\u2019t go back to sleep last night after the nightmare. I\u2019ve been awake since two in the morning and it\u2019s now after six.</p><p>I drop down onto the sidewalk when I reach her house. I stretch my legs out in front of me and lean forward, grabbing my shoes while I stretch the muscles in my back. I\u2019ve been tense for days and nothing I do seems to help.</p><p>Before I went to sleep last night I had no intention of running with her again today. But I\u2019ve been sitting alone for over four hours, wide awake, and the only thing that even remotely appealed to me was the thought of seeing Sky again.</p><p>I also had no intention of going back to school today but it seems way more appealing than staying home all day. It\u2019s like I\u2019ve been living minute to minute since the moment I got back from Austin last week. I\u2019m not sure from one moment to the next what I\u2019m doing or where I\u2019ll be or even what frame of mind I\u2019ll be in.</p><p>I don\u2019t like this instability.</p> <p>I also don\u2019t like that I\u2019m at her house again today, waiting on her to come outside for her morning run. I don\u2019t like that I still feel the need to be around her. I don\u2019t like the fact that I don\u2019t want her to believe the rumors about me. I don\u2019t give a shit when anyone else believes them. Why do I give a shit if she believes them?</p><p>I shouldn\u2019t. I should just go back home and leave her to believe whatever she wants to believe.</p><p>I stand up in an attempt to talk myself into leaving, but I just stand here, waiting on her. I know I need to leave and I know I don\u2019t want to be involved with anyone even remotely interested in Grayson, but I can\u2019t do it. I can\u2019t leave because I want to see her again a whole lot more than I want to leave.</p><p>A noise comes from the side of her house, so I take a few steps to get a look. She\u2019s climbing headfirst out of her window.</p><p>Just seeing her again, even from a distance, reminds me of why I crave to be around her so much. It\u2019s only been a few days, but since the moment I met her, no matter where I am, I\u2019m constantly wondering about her. My attention is constantly homed in on her like I\u2019m a compass and she\u2019s my North.</p><p>Once she\u2019s outside, she pauses and looks up toward the sky, inhaling a deep breath. I take a few hesitant steps toward her. \u201cDo you always climb out your window or were you just hoping to avoid me?\u201d</p><p>She spins around, wide-eyed. I try not to let my eyes dip below her neck, but the things I\u2019ve seen her run in are hard not to stare at.</p><p>Keep looking at her face, Holder. You can do it.</p><p>She glances at me, but doesn\u2019t make eye contact. Her eyes lock on my stomach and I\u2019m curious if it\u2019s because she likes that I\u2019m not wearing a shirt or if it\u2019s because she can\u2019t stand me to the point that it\u2019s hard for her to look me in the eyes. \u201cIf I was trying to avoid you I would have just stayed in bed.\u201d She walks past me and lowers herself onto the sidewalk.</p><p>I hate that her voice does things to my body that no other voice could ever do. But I also love it and want her to keep talking, even if she is rude most of the time.</p><p>I watch as she pushes her legs out in front of her and begins to stretch. She seems fairly calm today, despite the fact that I showed up. I sort of expected her to tell me to go the hell away after how we left things in the hallway yesterday.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if you\u2019d show up,\u201d I say, taking a seat on the sidewalk in front of her.</p><p>She lifts her head and looks me in the eyes this time. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I? I\u2019m not the one with the issues. Besides, neither of us owns the road.\u201d</p><p>Issues?</p><p>She thinks I have issues?</p><p>I\u2019m not the one feeding into the rumors like she is. I\u2019m also not the one leaving notes on her locker, nor am I one of the many people at school who have treated her like shit. If anything, I\u2019ve been one of the few people to be nice to her.</p><p>But she thinks I\u2019m the one with the issues?</p><p>\u201cGive me your hands,\u201d I say, mirroring her position. \u201cI need to stretch, too.\u201d</p><p>She shoots me a curious look, but takes my hands and leans back, pulling me forward.</p><p>\u201cFor the record,\u201d I say, \u201cI wasn\u2019t the one with the issue yesterday.\u201d</p><p>I can feel her lean back farther, tightening her grip on my wrists. \u201cAre you insinuating I\u2019m the one with the issue?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClarify,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t like vague.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t like vague.</p><p>Funny, because I don\u2019t either. I like truth and that\u2019s exactly the point I\u2019m trying to make to this girl. \u201cSky, if there\u2019s one thing you should know about me, it\u2019s that I don\u2019t do vague. I told you I\u2019ll only ever be honest with you, and to me, vague is the same thing as dishonesty.\u201d I switch positions and pull her forward as I lean back.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty vague answer you just gave me,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cI was never asked a question. I\u2019ve told you before, if you want to know something, just ask. You seem to think you know me, yet you\u2019ve never actually asked me anything yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know you,\u201d she snaps.</p><p>I laugh, because she\u2019s absolutely right. She doesn\u2019t know me at all, but it certainly seems like she\u2019s a quick one to judge.</p><p>I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m even bothering with her. She obviously doesn\u2019t want me to bother with her. I should just leave and let her think whatever the hell she wants to think.</p><p>I drop her hands and stand up. \u201cForget it,\u201d I mutter, turning to walk away. As much as I like being around her, there\u2019s only so much I\u2019m willing to put up with.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d she says, following after me.</p><p>I honestly expected her to just let me walk away. Hearing the word \u201cwait\u201d come out of her mouth and knowing she\u2019s following behind me does this thing to my chest that makes it feel alive again and it pisses me off because I don\u2019t want her to have that effect on me. \u201cWhat did I say?\u201d she asks, catching up to me. \u201cI don\u2019t know you. Why are you getting all pissy with me again?\u201d</p><p>Pissy?</p><p>Her word-choice makes me want to smile, but the fact that she doesn\u2019t recognize that she\u2019s the one who has been pissy for two days irritates the hell out of me. I stop walking and turn to face her, taking two steps toward her.</p><p>\u201cI guess after spending time with you over the last few days, I thought I\u2019d get a slightly different reaction from you at school. I\u2019ve given you plenty of opportunity to ask me whatever you want to ask me, but for some reason you want to believe everything you hear, despite the fact that you never heard any of it from me. And coming from someone with her own share of rumors, I figured you\u2019d be a little less judgmental.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrow and she puts her hands on her hips. \u201cSo that\u2019s what this is about? You thought the slutty new girl would be sympathetic to the gay-bashing asshole?\u201d</p><p>I groan out of frustration. I hate hearing her refer to herself like that. \u201cDon\u2019t do that, Sky.\u201d</p><p>She takes a step toward me. \u201cDon\u2019t do what? Call you a gay-bashing asshole? Okay. Let\u2019s practice this honesty policy of yours. Did you or did you not beat up that student last year so badly that you spent a year in juvenile detention?\u201d</p><p>I want to grab her by the shoulders and shake her out of sheer frustration. Why can\u2019t she see that she\u2019s behaving just like everyone else? I know she\u2019s not like them, so I don\u2019t understand her attitude at all. Anyone that can brush off rumors about themselves isn\u2019t the type of person who would spread them. So why the hell is she believing them?</p><p>I look her hard in the eyes. \u201cWhen I said don\u2019t do that, I wasn\u2019t referring to you insulting me. I was referring to you insulting yourself.\u201d I close the gap between us and when I do, she takes in a small rush of air and closes her mouth. I lower my voice and confirm the only part of the rumors that are true. \u201cAnd yes. I beat his ass to within an inch of his life, and if the bastard was standing in front of me right now, I\u2019d do it again.\u201d</p><p>We stare at each other in silence. She\u2019s looking at me with a mixture of anger and fear, and I hate that she\u2019s feeling either of those things. She takes a slow step back, putting space between us, but doesn\u2019t break her firm stare.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to run with you today,\u201d she says flatly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really feel like running with you, either.\u201d</p><p>I turn around at the same time she does and immediately feel nothing but regret. I didn\u2019t accomplish anything by coming here today. If anything, I just made things worse with her. I shouldn\u2019t have to come out and tell her that the majority of what she thinks she knows about me is false. I shouldn\u2019t have to explain myself to anyone and neither should she.</p><p>But I regret that I didn\u2019t explain myself, because I need her to know that I\u2019m not that guy.</p><p>I just don\u2019t know why I need her to know that.</p><p>Chapter Twelve-and-a-half</p><p>Les,</p><p>Remember when we were fourteen and I had a crush on Ava? You hardly knew her but I forced you to become friends with her so she could come to the house and spend the night with you. She was the first girl I ever kissed and we lasted all of two weeks before she started to get on my everlasting nerve. Unfortunately, by the time we broke up, you really did like her. Then I was forced to see her on a recurring basis for an entire year after that until she moved. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I know you were sad when she moved, but I was so relieved. It was way too awkward having to interact with her on a regular basis after that.</p><p>I also know it was cruel of me to force you to be her friend just so she would come stay the night at our house. I thought I learned my lesson and I never asked you to do it again.</p><p>Well, I didn\u2019t learn my lesson. Today I\u2019ve been wishing you were still here, purely for selfish reasons, because I would give anything for you to be friends with Sky. After running with her this morning, I can see clearly that she\u2019s irritating and irrational and stubborn and gorgeous as hell and I want so bad to stop thinking about her, but I can\u2019t. If you were here, I could ask you to be her friend so she would have a reason to come over to our house, even though we\u2019re eighteen now and not fourteen. But I want an excuse to talk to her again. I want to give her one more chance to hear me out, but I don\u2019t know how to go about doing that. I don\u2019t want to do it at school and we aren\u2019t running together anymore. Short of walking up to her house and knocking on her front door, I can\u2019t figure out a way to get her to talk to me.</p><p>Wait. That\u2019s actually not a bad idea.</p> <p>Thanks, Les.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>\u201cWe going out tonight?\u201d I ask Daniel as we make our way toward the parking lot. We usually do something on Friday nights, but tonight I\u2019m actually hoping he says no. I decided a few days ago that I wanted to go to Sky\u2019s house tonight to try to talk to her. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a good idea, but I know if I don\u2019t at least try, I\u2019ll drive myself crazy wondering if it would have made a difference.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t,\u201d Daniel says. \u201cI\u2019m taking Val out. We could do something tomorrow night, though. I\u2019ll call you.\u201d</p><p>I nod and he turns to head toward his car. I open my door, but pause when I see Sky\u2019s car out of the corner of my eye. She\u2019s leaning against it, talking to Grayson.</p> <p>From the looks of it, they might be doing more than just talking.</p><p>I\u2019d be lying if I didn\u2019t admit that seeing his hands on her makes every muscle in my body clench tight. I prop my arm on my door and watch them for some stupid, self-torturous reason.</p><p>From here, she doesn\u2019t look happy. She pushes him away from her and takes a step away from him. She\u2019s watching him while he talks, then he moves in and wraps his arms around her again. I take a step away from my car, prepared to walk across the parking lot and pull his ignorant ass off her. She clearly doesn\u2019t want him touching her, but I stop and take a step back when it looks like she relents and gives in to him. As soon as he leans in to kiss her, I have to look away.</p><p>It\u2019s physically impossible to watch. I don\u2019t understand her. I don\u2019t understand what she sees in him and I really don\u2019t understand why she can\u2019t seem to stand me, when he\u2019s the actual asshole.</p><p>Maybe I\u2019m wrong about her. Maybe she really is just like everyone else. Maybe I\u2019ve just been hoping she was different for my own sake.</p><p>Or maybe not.</p> <p>I\u2019m looking at them again, seeing her reaction to what he\u2019s doing to her. His arms are still around her and it looks like he\u2019s still kissing her neck or shoulder or wherever the fuck his mouth is. But I could have sworn she just rolled her eyes.</p><p>Now she\u2019s looking at her watch, not responding to him at all. She drops her arm and rests her hands at her sides and she\u2019s just standing there, looking more inconvenienced by him than interested.</p><p>I continue to watch them and continue to grow more and more confused by her lack of interest. Her expression is almost lifeless, until the second she locks eyes with mine. Her whole body tenses and her eyes grow wide. She immediately looks away and pushes Grayson off her. She turns her back to him and gets into her car. I\u2019m too far away to hear what she says to him, but the fact that she\u2019s driving away and he\u2019s flipping her off with both hands tells me that whatever she said to him wasn\u2019t at all what he wanted to hear.</p><p>I smile.</p><p>I\u2019m still confused, I\u2019m still angry, I\u2019m still intrigued and I\u2019m still planning on showing up on her doorstep tonight. Especially after witnessing whatever that was I just witnessed.</p><p>I ring the doorbell and wait.</p><p>I\u2019m a ball of nerves right now, but only because I don\u2019t have a clue how she\u2019ll react to seeing me on her doorstep. I also don\u2019t know what the hell I\u2019m going to say to her once she does finally open the door.</p><p>I ring the doorbell again after waiting several moments. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m the last person she\u2019ll expect to see here on a Friday night.</p> <p>Shit. It\u2019s Friday night. She\u2019s probably not even home.</p><p>I hear footsteps making their way toward the door and it opens. She\u2019s standing in front of me a frazzled mess. Her hair is loosely pulled back, but strands have fallen all around her face. She\u2019s got white powder dusted across her nose and cheek and even has some in the loose strands of hair framing her face. She looks adorable. And shocked.</p><p>Several seconds pass with us just standing there and I realize that I should probably be the one speaking right now, since I\u2019m the one who showed up at her house.</p><p>God, why does every single thing about her throw me off like this?</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she says.</p><p>Her calm voice is like a breath of fresh air. She doesn\u2019t seem pissed that I\u2019m here unannounced. \u201cHi,\u201d I say, returning her greeting.</p><p>Another round of awkward silence ensues and she tilts her head to the side. \u201cUm . . .\u201d She squints and crinkles up her nose and I can tell she\u2019s not sure what to do or say next.</p><p>\u201cYou busy?\u201d I ask her, knowing just by the disarray of her appearance that whatever she was doing, she was working hard at it.</p><p>She turns and glances back into her house, then faces me again. \u201cSort of.\u201d</p><p>Sort of.</p><p>I take her reply for what it is. She\u2019s obviously trying not to be rude, but I can see that this stupid idea of mine to just show up announced was just that . . . a stupid idea.</p><p>I glance at my car behind me, gauging how far the walk of shame I\u2019m about to take will be. \u201cYeah,\u201d I say, pointing over my shoulder at my car. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll . . . go.\u201d I take a step down and begin to turn toward my car, wishing I was anywhere but in this awkward predicament.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she says quickly. She takes a step back and opens the door for me. \u201cYou can come in, but you might be put to work.\u201d</p><p>Instant relief overcomes me and I nod, walking inside. A quick glance around the living room makes it appear that she might be the only one home right now. I hope she is, because it would make things a lot easier if it were just the two of us.</p><p>She walks around me and into the kitchen. She picks up a measuring cup and resumes whatever it was she was doing before I showed up on her doorstep. Her back is to me and she\u2019s quiet. I slowly make my way into the kitchen and eye the baked goods lining her bar.</p><p>\u201cYou prepping for a bake sale?\u201d I ask, making my way around the bar so that her back isn\u2019t completely to me.</p><p>\u201cMy mom\u2019s out of town for the weekend,\u201d she says, glancing up at me. \u201cShe\u2019s antisugar, so I kind of go crazy when she\u2019s not here.\u201d</p><p>Her mom\u2019s out of town, so she bakes? I really can\u2019t figure this girl out. I reach over to the plate of cookies between us on the bar and pick one up, looking to her for permission to try it.</p><p>\u201cHelp yourself,\u201d she says. \u201cBut be warned, just because I like to bake doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m good at it.\u201d She refocuses her attention to the bowl in front of her.</p><p>\u201cSo you get the house to yourself and you spend Friday night baking? Typical teenager,\u201d I tease. I take a bite of the cookie and ohmygod. She can bake. I like her even more.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I say?\u201d she says with a shrug. \u201cI\u2019m a rebel.\u201d</p><p>I smile, then eye the plate of cookies again. There have to be a dozen there and I plan on eating at least half of them before she kicks me out of her house. I\u2019m gonna need milk.</p><p>She\u2019s still intensely focused on the bowl in front of her, so I take it upon myself to find my own glass. \u201cGot any milk?\u201d I ask, making my way to the refrigerator. She doesn\u2019t answer my question, so I open the refrigerator and remove the milk, then pour myself a glass. I finish the rest of the cookie, then take a drink. I wince, because whatever the hell this is, it\u2019s not real milk. Or it\u2019s rotten. I glance at the label before shutting the refrigerator and see that it\u2019s almond milk. I don\u2019t want to be rude, so I take another drink and turn around.</p><p>She\u2019s looking straight at me with an arched eyebrow. I smile. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t offer cookies without milk, you know. You\u2019re a pretty pathetic hostess.\u201d I swipe another cookie and take a seat at the bar.</p><p>She grins right before she turns around to face the counter again. \u201cI try to save my hospitality for invited guests.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cOuch.\u201d</p><p>The sarcasm in her voice is nice, though, because it helps ease my tension. She powers on the mixer and keeps her focus on the bowl in front of her. I love that she hasn\u2019t asked why I\u2019m here. I know she\u2019s wondering what I\u2019m doing here, but I also know from previous interaction with her that she\u2019s incredibly stubborn and more than likely won\u2019t ask what I\u2019m doing here, no matter how much she wants to know.</p><p>She turns off the mixer and pulls the mixing blades loose, then brings one to her mouth and licks it.</p><p>Holy shit.</p><p>I gulp.</p><p>\u201cWant one?\u201d she says, holding one up for me to take. \u201cIt\u2019s German chocolate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow hospitable of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up and lick it or I\u2019m keeping it for myself,\u201d she says teasingly. She smiles and walks to the cabinet, then fills a glass with water. \u201cYou want some water or do you want to continue pretending you can stomach that vegan shit?\u201d</p><p>I laugh, then immediately push my cup toward her. \u201cI was trying to be nice, but I can\u2019t take another sip of whatever the hell this is. Yes, water. Please.\u201d</p><p>She laughs and fills my cup with water, then takes a seat across from me. She picks up a brownie and takes a bite, holding eye contact with me. She doesn\u2019t speak but I know she\u2019s curious why I\u2019m here. The fact that she still hasn\u2019t asked, though, makes me admire her stubbornness.</p><p>I know I should offer up my reason for showing up out of the blue, but I\u2019m a little stubborn myself and feel like dragging this thing out with her a little longer. I\u2019m kind of enjoying it.</p><p>We silently watch each other until she\u2019s almost finished with her brownie. The way she\u2019s semismiling at me while she eats is making my pulse race and if I don\u2019t look away from her, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll blurt out everything I want to say to her all at once.</p><p>In order to avoid that, I stand up and walk into the living room to take a look around. I can\u2019t watch her eat for another second and I need to refocus my attention on why I\u2019m here, because I\u2019m even starting to forget.</p><p>There are several pictures hanging on her walls, so I walk closer to them to take a look. There aren\u2019t any pictures of her that are more than a few years old, but the ones where she\u2019s younger than she is now are jarring to look at. She really does look just like Hope. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It\u2019s surreal, looking into those big brown eyes of the little girl in the picture. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that she\u2019s in several pictures with her mother, I\u2019d be convinced she really was Hope.</p><p>But she can\u2019t be Hope, because Hope\u2019s mother passed away when she was just a little girl. Unless Karen isn\u2019t Sky\u2019s mom.</p><p>I hate that my mind is still going there. \u201cYour mom seems really young,\u201d I say, noticing the noticeable small age difference between them.</p><p>\u201cShe is young.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look like her. Do you look like your dad?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t remember what he looks like.\u201d</p><p>She looks sad when she says it, but I\u2019m curious why she doesn\u2019t remember what he looks like.</p><p>\u201cIs your dad dead?\u201d</p><p>She sighs. I can tell she\u2019s uncomfortable talking about it. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Haven\u2019t seen him since I was three.\u201d It\u2019s clear she doesn\u2019t feel like elaborating. I walk back to the kitchen and reclaim my seat.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I get? No story?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, there\u2019s a story. I just don\u2019t want to tell it.\u201d</p><p>I can see I\u2019m not getting any more information out of her right now, so I change the subject. \u201cYour cookies were good. You shouldn\u2019t downplay your baking abilities.\u201d</p><p>She smiles, but her smile fades as soon as the phone on the counter between us sounds off, indicating a text. I look down at it just as she jumps up and rushes to the oven. She swings it open to eye the cake and I realize she thinks the sound came from the oven, rather than the phone.</p><p>I pick up the phone just as she shuts the oven and turns to face me. \u201cYou got a text.\u201d I laugh. \u201cYour cake is fine.\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes and throws the oven mitt on the counter, then walks back to her seat. I\u2019m curious about the cell phone, especially since she told me earlier this week that she didn\u2019t have one.</p> <p>\u201cI thought you weren\u2019t allowed to have a phone,\u201d I say, glancing at all the texts as I scroll my finger down the screen. \u201cOr was that a really pathetic excuse to avoid giving me your number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not allowed,\u201d she says. \u201cMy best friend gave it to me the other day. It can\u2019t do anything but text.\u201d</p><p>I turn the phone around to face her. \u201cWhat the hell kind of texts are these?\u201d I read one out loud.</p><p>\u201cSky, you are beautiful. You are possibly the most exquisite creature in the universe and if anyone tells you otherwise, I\u2019ll cut the bitch.\u201d I glance at her, the texts making me even more curious about her than I was before. \u201cOh, God,\u201d I say. \u201cThey\u2019re all like this. Please tell me you don\u2019t text these to yourself for daily motivation.\u201d</p><p>She laughs and snatches the phone out of my hand. \u201cStop. You\u2019re ruining the fun of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God, you do? Those are all from you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she says defensively. \u201cThey\u2019re from Six. She\u2019s my best friend and she\u2019s halfway around the world and she misses me. She wants me to not be sad, so she sends me nice texts every day. I think it\u2019s sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you do not,\u201d I say. \u201cYou think it\u2019s annoying and you probably don\u2019t even read them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe means well,\u201d she says, folding her arms defensively across her chest.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll ruin you,\u201d I tease. \u201cThose texts will inflate your ego so much, you\u2019ll explode.\u201d I scroll through the settings on her phone and punch the number into my phone. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m leaving here without her number, and this is the perfect excuse to get it. \u201cWe need to rectify this situation before you start suffering from delusions of grandeur.\u201d I give her back her phone and text her.</p><p>Your cookies suck ass. And you\u2019re really not that pretty.</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d I ask after she reads it. \u201cDid the ego deflate enough?\u201d</p><p>She laughs and places the phone facedown on the counter. \u201cYou know just the right things to say to a girl.\u201d She walks into the living room and spins around to face me. \u201cWant a tour of the house?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t hesitate. Of course I want a tour of her house. I follow her through the house and listen as she speaks. I pretend to be interested in everything she\u2019s pointing out, but in reality I can only concentrate on the sound of her voice. She could talk to me all night and I\u2019d never get tired of listening to her.</p><p>\u201cMy room,\u201d she says, swinging open the door to her bedroom. \u201cFeel free to look around, but being as though there aren\u2019t any people eighteen or older here, stay off the bed. I\u2019m not allowed to get pregnant this weekend.\u201d</p><p>I pause as I\u2019m passing through her door and eye her. \u201cOnly this weekend?\u201d I ask, matching her wit. \u201cYou plan on getting knocked up next weekend, instead?\u201d</p><p>She smiles and I continue making my way into her room. \u201cNah,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll probably wait a few more weeks.\u201d</p><p>I shouldn\u2019t be here. Every minute I spend with her makes me like her more and more. Now I\u2019m in her room and there\u2019s no one in the house other than her and me, not to mention the fact that there\u2019s this bed between us that she told me to stay off of.</p><p>I shouldn\u2019t be here.</p><p>I came here to show her I\u2019m the good guy, not the bad guy. So why am I looking at her bed and not having good thoughts right now?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m eighteen,\u201d I say, unable to stop imagining what she looks like when she lies in this bed.</p><p>\u201cYay for you?\u201d she says, confused.</p><p>I smile at her, then nod toward her bed as explanation. \u201cYou said to stay off your bed because I\u2019m not eighteen. I\u2019m just pointing out that I am.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders tense and she inhales a quick breath. \u201cOh,\u201d she says, slightly flustered. \u201cWell then, I meant nineteen.\u201d</p><p>I like her reaction a little too much, so I try to refocus and concentrate on why I\u2019m here.</p><p>Why am I here? Because all that\u2019s running through my mind right now is bed, bed, bed.</p><p>I\u2019m here to make a point. A much-needed, valid point. I walk as far away from the bed as I can get and end up at the window.</p><p>The same window I\u2019ve heard so much about over the course of the past week at school. It\u2019s amazing the things you can learn if you just shut up and listen.</p><p>I lean my head out of it and look around, then pull back inside. I don\u2019t like that she keeps it open. It\u2019s not safe.</p><p>\u201cSo this is the infamous window, huh?\u201d</p><p>If that comment doesn\u2019t direct the conversation in the direction I\u2019m hoping, I don\u2019t know what will.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, Holder?\u201d she snaps.</p><p>I turn to face her and she\u2019s eyeing me fiercely. \u201cDid I say something wrong, Sky? Or untrue? Unfounded, maybe?\u201d</p><p>She immediately walks to her door and holds it open. \u201cYou know exactly what you said and you got the reaction you wanted. Happy? You can go now.\u201d</p><p>I hate that I\u2019m pissing her off, but I ignore her request for me to leave. I look away and walk to the side of her bed and pick up a book. I pretend to flip through it while I contemplate how to start the conversation.</p><p>\u201cHolder, I\u2019m asking you as nicely as I\u2019m going to ask you. Please leave.\u201d</p><p>I set the book down and take a seat on her bed, despite the fact that she told me not to. She\u2019s already pissed at me. What\u2019s one more thing?</p><p>She stomps over to the bed and actually grabs my legs, attempting to physically pull me off the bed. She then reaches up and yanks on my wrists in an attempt to pull me up, but I pull her down to the bed and flip her onto her back, holding her arms to the mattress.</p><p>Now that I\u2019ve got her good and riled up, it would be a good time to tell her what I came here to tell her. That I\u2019m not that guy. That I wasn\u2019t in juvi for a year. That I didn\u2019t beat that kid up because he was gay.</p><p>But here I am holding her down to the mattress and I have no idea how we even got to this point, but I\u2019ll be damned if I can form a coherent thought. She\u2019s not struggling to get out from under me at all and we\u2019re both staring at each other like we\u2019re daring the other one to be the first to make a move.</p><p>My heart is pounding against my chest and if I don\u2019t back away from her right now I\u2019ll do something to those lips of hers that will for sure end up with me getting slapped.</p><p>Or kissed back.</p><p>The thought is tempting, but I don\u2019t risk it. I let go of her arms and wipe my thumb across the end of her nose. \u201cFlour. It\u2019s been bugging me,\u201d I say. I back away and rest my back against her headboard.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t move. She\u2019s breathing heavily and staring up at the ceiling. I\u2019m not sure what she\u2019s thinking, but she\u2019s not trying to kick me out of her room anymore, so that\u2019s good.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know he was gay,\u201d I say.</p><p>She turns her head in my direction and she\u2019s still flat on her back. She doesn\u2019t say anything, so I use the opportunity to explain in more detail while I\u2019ve got her full attention.</p><p>\u201cI beat him up because he was an asshole. I had no idea he was gay.\u201d</p><p>She eyes me, expressionless, then slowly turns her head back toward the ceiling. I give her a moment to ponder what I just said. She\u2019ll either believe me and feel guilty or she won\u2019t believe me and she\u2019ll still be pissed. Either way, I don\u2019t want her to feel guilty or pissed. But we\u2019re not left with any other choices of emotions in this situation.</p><p>I remain quiet, wanting her to respond to me with something, at least.</p><p>A sound comes from the kitchen and it actually resembles an oven timer rather than her phone. \u201cCake!\u201d she yells. She\u2019s off the bed and out the bedroom door and I find myself alone in her room on her bed. I close my eyes and lean my head against the headboard.</p><p>I want her to believe me. I want her to trust me and I want her to know the truth about my past. There\u2019s something about her that tells me she\u2019s not like all the other people I\u2019ve encountered who disappoint me. I just hope I\u2019m not wrong about her, because I like being around her. She actually makes me feel like I have a purpose. I haven\u2019t felt like I had a purpose in over thirteen months.</p><p>I glance up when she walks back into the room and she smiles sheepishly. She has a cookie in her mouth and another in her hand. She holds it out to me and drops down next to me on the bed. Her head lands against her pillow and she sighs.</p><p>\u201cI guess the gay-bashing asshole remark was really judgmental on my part then, huh? You aren\u2019t really an ignorant homophobe who spent the last year in juvenile detention?\u201d</p><p>Mission accomplished.</p><p>And it was so much easier than I thought it would be.</p><p>I smile and scoot down until I\u2019m flat on the bed next to her. \u201cNope,\u201d I say, looking up at the stars plastered across her ceiling. \u201cNot at all. I spent the entire last year living with my father in Austin. I don\u2019t even know where the story about me being sent to juvi came into the picture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you defend yourself against the rumors if they aren\u2019t true?\u201d</p><p>What an odd question, coming from someone who hasn\u2019t defended herself at all this entire week. I glance in her direction. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She quietly nods. \u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>We both look back up to her ceiling.

I like that she didn\u2019t argue about it, especially knowing how stubborn she is.</p><p>I like that I was right about her.</p><p>\u201cThe window comment from earlier?\u201d she says. \u201cYou were just making a point about rumors? You really weren\u2019t trying to be mean?\u201d</p> <p>I hate that she actually thought I was just being cruel, even if it was only for a minute.

I\u2019m right about that, at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may be intense, but I\u2019m not mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not a slut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a gay-bashing asshole.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo we\u2019re all clear?\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cYeah, I guess so.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s quiet for another moment until she inhales a long, deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Holder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Sky,\u201d I say. I didn\u2019t come here for an apology. I don\u2019t want her to feel guilty about her misconception. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t say anything else and we both continue to look up at the stars. I\u2019m conflicted right now because we\u2019re both on her bed and as much as I try to ignore my attraction for her, it\u2019s sort of hard when I\u2019m inches from her.</p><p>I\u2019m curious if she finds me attractive at all. I\u2019m almost positive she does based on the tiny things she does when I\u2019m around her that she tries to hide. Like the times I\u2019ve caught her staring at my chest when I ran with her. Or the way she sucks in a breath when I lean in to speak to her. Or how she always seems to be struggling not to smile when she\u2019s trying so hard to be mad at me.</p> <p>I\u2019m not positive what she thinks about me or how she feels, but I know one thing . . . she definitely doesn\u2019t act indifferent toward me like she does toward Grayson.</p><p>Thinking about that incident and how just a few hours ago she was kissing him makes me grimace. It may not be appropriate to ask her about it, but I sure as hell can\u2019t stop thinking about how much I hate the thought of her kissing anyone, especially Grayson. And if there\u2019s ever a chance that I\u2019ll be the one kissing her, I need to know that she won\u2019t be kissing him again.</p><p>Ever.</p><p>\u201cI need to ask you something,\u201d I say. I prepare myself to bring it up, knowing she more than likely doesn\u2019t want to talk about it. But I have to know how she feels about him. I inhale a deep breath and roll over to face her. \u201cWhy were you letting Grayson do what he was doing to you in the parking lot?\u201d</p><p>She winces and shakes her head ever so slightly. \u201cI already told you. He\u2019s not my boyfriend and he\u2019s not the one who gave me the black eye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking because of any of that,\u201d I say, even though I really am. \u201cI\u2019m asking because I saw how you reacted. You were irritated with him. You even looked a little bored. I just want to know why you allow him to do those things if you clearly don\u2019t want him touching you.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s quiet for a second. \u201cMy lack of interest was that obvious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. And from fifty yards away. I\u2019m just surprised he didn\u2019t take the hint.\u201d</p> <p>She immediately flips onto her side and props up on her elbow. \u201cI know, right? I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve turned him down but he just doesn\u2019t stop. It\u2019s really pathetic. And unattractive.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t even describe how good it feels to hear her say that.</p><p>\u201cThen why do you let him do it?\u201d</p><p>She keeps her eyes locked on mine, but she doesn\u2019t answer me. We\u2019re inches apart. On her bed. Her mouth is right here.</p><p>So close.</p><p>We both flip onto our backs almost simultaneously.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d she says. Her voice sounds sad and I definitely didn\u2019t come here to make her feel sad.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to explain. I was just curious. It\u2019s really not my business.\u201d</p><p>She pulls her arms up behind her head and rests her head on her hands. \u201cHave you ever had a serious girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>I have no idea where she\u2019s going with this, but at least she\u2019s talking, so I go with it. \u201cYep,\u201d I say. \u201cBut I hope you aren\u2019t about to ask for details, because I don\u2019t go there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not why I\u2019m asking,\u201d she says, shaking her head. \u201cWhen you kissed her, what did you feel?\u201d</p><p>I definitely don\u2019t know where she\u2019s going with this. But still, I indulge her. It\u2019s the least I can do for showing up unannounced, then practically insulting her reputation before getting my point across.</p><p>\u201cYou want honesty, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I ever want,\u201d she says, mimicking my own words.</p><p>I grin. \u201cAll right, then. I guess I felt . . . horny.\u201d</p><p>When I say the word horny, I swear she sucks in a breath. She\u2019s quick to recover, though. \u201cSo you get the butterflies and the sweaty palms and the rapid heartbeat and all that?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Not with every girl I\u2019ve been with, but most of them.\u201d</p><p>She tilts her head toward me and arches an eyebrow, which makes me grin. \u201cThere weren\u2019t that many,\u201d I say. At least I don\u2019t think there were that many. I\u2019m not sure what number constitutes a lot at this point and even then, people measure things on different scales. \u201cWhat\u2019s your point?\u201d I ask, relieved she isn\u2019t asking me to clarify exactly how many there have been.</p><p>\u201cMy point is that I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t feel any of that. When I make out with guys, I don\u2019t feel anything at all. Just numbness. So sometimes I let Grayson do what he does to me, not because I enjoy it, but because I like not feeling anything at all.\u201d</p><p>I was absolutely not expecting that answer. I\u2019m not sure that I like that answer. I mean, I like that she doesn\u2019t actually feel anything for Grayson, but I hate that it hasn\u2019t stopped her from letting him try to get what he wants.</p><p>I also don\u2019t like that she admitted to never feeling anything, because I can honestly say when I\u2019m around her, I\u2019ve never felt so much.</p><p>\u201cI know it doesn\u2019t make sense, and no, I\u2019m not a lesbian,\u201d she says defensively. \u201cI\u2019ve just never been attracted to anyone before you and I don\u2019t know why.\u201d</p><p>I quickly turn and look at her, not sure that I heard her correctly. But based on her reaction and the way her arm comes up and immediately covers her face, I know for a fact I heard her correctly.</p><p>She\u2019s attracted to me.</p><p>And she didn\u2019t intend to admit that out loud.</p><p>And I\u2019m pretty sure that accidental admission just made my entire year.</p><p>I reach over and slide my fingers around her wrist, pulling her arm away from her face. I know she\u2019s embarrassed right now, but there\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019m letting this go.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re attracted to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d she groans. \u201cThat\u2019s the last thing you need for your ego.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s probably true,\u201d I admit, laughing. \u201cBetter hurry up and insult me before my ego gets as big as yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need a haircut,\u201d she blurts out. \u201cReally bad. It gets in your eyes and you squint and you\u2019re constantly moving it out of the way like you\u2019re Justin Bieber and it\u2019s really distracting.\u201d</p><p>I know she doesn\u2019t have access to technology, so I let it slide that Justin Bieber cut his hair off a long time ago. I\u2019m disappointed that I even know that. I tug at my hair with my fingers and fall back against my pillow. \u201cMan. That really hurt. It seems like you\u2019ve thought that one out for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust since Monday,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cYou met me on Monday. So technically, you\u2019ve been thinking about how much you hate my hair since the moment we met?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot every moment.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. I wonder if it\u2019s possible for people to fall in love with a person one characteristic at a time, or if you fall for the entire person at once. Because I think I just fell in love with her wit. And her bluntness. And maybe even her mouth, but I won\u2019t allow myself to stare at it long enough to confirm.</p><p>Shit. That\u2019s already three characteristics and I\u2019ve only been here an hour.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you think I\u2019m hot,\u201d I say, breaking the silence.</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou probably faked passing out the other day, just so you could be carried in my hot, sweaty, manly arms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d she says again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet you fantasize about me at night, right here in this bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Holder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou probably even . . .\u201d</p><p>She slaps her hand over my mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re way hotter when you aren\u2019t speaking.\u201d</p><p>I shut up, but only because I want to revel in the fact that this night has already turned out better than I ever anticipated. Every second I\u2019m with her I like her more and more. I like her sense of humor and I like that she gets my sense of humor. She\u2019s the first girl besides Les to ever actually give me a run for my money and I can\u2019t seem to get enough of it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m bored,\u201d I say, hoping she\u2019ll suggest an interesting make-out session in lieu of staring at her ceiling. Although, if my options are limited to staring at her ceiling all night or going home, I\u2019ll gladly stare at her ceiling.</p><p>\u201cSo go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to,\u201d I say resolutely. I\u2019m having way too much fun to go home. \u201cWhat do you do when you\u2019re bored? You don\u2019t have internet or TV. Do you just sit around all day and think about how hot I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI read,\u201d she says. \u201cA lot. Sometimes I bake. Sometimes I run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRead, bake, and run. And fantasize about me. What a riveting life you lead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sort of like it, too,\u201d I say. And I do like it. We already have the running in common. And she may not realize it, but we also have the fantasizing in common. I don\u2019t bake, but I do like her baking.</p><p>That leaves reading. I read when I need to, which isn\u2019t a lot. But I suddenly want to know everything about everything that interests her and if reading interests her, it interests me too. I reach over and pick up the book from her nightstand. \u201cHere, read this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to read it out loud? You\u2019re that bored?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty damn bored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a romance.\u201d She says it like it\u2019s a warning.</p><p>\u201cLike I said. Pretty damn bored. Read.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs and adjusts her pillow, then begins reading.</p><p>\u201cI was almost three days old before the hospital forced them to decide. They agreed to take the first three letters of both names and compromised on Layken . . .\u201d</p><p>She continues to read and I continue to let her. After several chapters, I can\u2019t tell if my rapid-fire pulse is a result of listening to her voice for so long or if it\u2019s from the sexual tension in the book. Maybe both of them coupled together is what\u2019s doing it. Sky should really think about a career in voiceovers or audiobooks or some shit like that because her voice is . . . </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe glides across the room . . .\u201d</p><p>Her voice is trailing off.</p><p>\u201c. . . and bends down, snatching up the . . .\u201d</p><p>And . . . she\u2019s out. The book falls against her chest and I laugh quietly, but I don\u2019t get up. because the fact that she fell asleep doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m ready to leave.</p> <p>I lie with her for about half an hour, confirming the fact that yes, I\u2019m definitely in love with her mouth. I watch her sleep until my phone chimes. I scoot her away from me and onto her back, then pull my phone out of my pocket.</p><p>Dude. It\u2019s Daniel, me. Val is f\u2019ng crazy n I think I\u2019m at that Burker Ging and come get me I can\u2019t drive. I drank and I hate her.</p><p>I text him back immediately.</p><p>Good idea. Stay put. Be there in thirty.</p><p>I slide the phone back in my pocket, but it sounds off again with an incoming text.</p> <p>Holder?</p><p>I shake my head and shoot a text back that says, Yeah? He replies immediately.</p><p>Oh, good. Just mak\u2019n sure it was u, man.</p><p>Jeez. He\u2019s more than just drunk.</p><p>I stand up and take the book out of her hands, then set it on the nightstand and mark the page she stopped at so I\u2019ll have an excuse to come back over here tomorrow. I walk to the kitchen and spend the next ten minutes cleaning up her mess. I swear you would think she harbored resentment toward flour considering the amount I have to wipe up. After all the food is wrapped in Saran Wrap (minus the few cookies I might have swiped), I walk back to her bedroom, then sit down on the edge of her bed.</p><p>She\u2019s snoring.</p> <p>I love it.</p><p>Shit. That\u2019s four things already.</p><p>I really need to leave.</p><p>Before standing up to leave, I slowly lean forward, hesitating, not wanting to wake her. But I can\u2019t leave here without a little preview. I continue inching toward her until my mouth grazes her lips, and I kiss her.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen-and-a-half</p><p>Les,</p><p>Sky, Sky, Sky, Sky, Sky, Sky, Sky, Sky, Sky.</p><p>There. Get used to it, because I have a feeling she\u2019s all I\u2019m going to be talking about for a while. Oh, my God, Les. I can\u2019t even explain to you how perfect this girl is. And when I say perfect, I mean imperfect, because there\u2019s just so much wrong with her. But everything wrong with her is everything that draws me in and makes her perfect.</p> <p>She\u2019s flat-out rude to me and I love it. She\u2019s stubborn and I love it. She\u2019s a smartass and she\u2019s sarcastic and every witty thing that comes out of her mouth is like music to my ears because that\u2019s exactly what I want. She\u2019s what I need and I don\u2019t want her to change at all. There\u2019s not a single thing about her I would change.</p><p>There is one thing about her that worries me, though, and that\u2019s the fact that she seems to be a little emotionally detached. And as noticeable as it was when I saw her with Grayson, I don\u2019t see that at all when she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m almost convinced she feels different about me, but I would be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t worried that she wouldn\u2019t feel anything if I kissed her. Because dammit, Les, I want to kiss her so fucking bad but I\u2019m too scared. I\u2019m scared if I kiss her too soon, it\u2019ll feel like every other kiss she\u2019s ever received. She\u2019ll feel nothing.</p><p>I don\u2019t want her to feel nothing when I kiss her. I want her to feel everything.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>What you want to do tonight?</p><p>I read Daniel\u2019s text and respond.</p><p>Sorry. Plans.</p><p>WTF, puss flap!? No! Me. You. Plans.</p><p>Can\u2019t. Pretty sure I have a date.</p><p>Sky?</p><p>Yep.</p><p>Can I come?</p><p>Nope.</p><p>Can I be your date next Saturday, then?</p><p>Sure, babe.</p><p>Can\u2019t wait, sugar.</p><p>I laugh at Daniel\u2019s text, then clear the screen and find Sky\u2019s number. I haven\u2019t heard from her since she fell asleep on me last night, so I\u2019m not even sure if she wants me at her house tonight.</p><p>What time can I come over? Not that I\u2019m looking forward to it or anything. You\u2019re really, really boring.</p><p>After I hit send, I get another incoming text from a number I don\u2019t recognize.</p><p>If you\u2019re dating my girl, get your own prepaid minutes and quit wasting mine, Jackass.</p><p>The only person I know with prepaid minutes is Sky. And she said her best friend bought her the phone, so I\u2019m seriously hoping this text is from her friend and not someone else. I immediately text back, hoping to find out more.</p><p>How do I get more minutes?</p><p>As soon as I hit send on that text, Sky\u2019s response comes through.</p><p>Be here at seven. And bring me something to eat. I\u2019m not cooking for you.</p><p>Rude.</p><p>I love it.</p><p>She texted me again while I was at the grocery store, asking me to hurry. I really, seriously like that she wanted me here sooner. I like it a lot. I like her a lot. I like this whole weekend a lot.</p><p>Her front door swings open just moments after I ring the doorbell. She\u2019s smiling as soon as she sees me and I curse under my breath because that\u2019s just one more thing about her that I just fell in love with. She looks down at the sacks of groceries in my hands and arches an eyebrow.</p><p>I shrug. \u201cOne of us has to be the hospitable one.\u201d I walk up the steps and ease past her, then make my way into her kitchen. \u201cI hope you like spaghetti and meatballs, because that\u2019s what you\u2019re getting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re cooking dinner for me?\u201d she asks skeptically from behind me.</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m cooking for me, but you\u2019re welcome to eat some if you want.\u201d I glance back at her and smile so she\u2019ll know I\u2019m teasing.</p><p>\u201cAre you always so sarcastic?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you always answer questions with questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>She grabs a towel off the bar and throws it at me but I dodge it. \u201cYou want something to drink?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re offering to make me something to drink in my own house?\u201d</p><p>I walk to the refrigerator and scan the shelves, but my options are limited. \u201cDo you want milk that tastes like ass or do you want soda?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we even have soda?\u201d</p><p>I peer around the refrigerator door and grin at her. \u201cCan either of us say anything that isn\u2019t a question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, can we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long do you think we can keep this up?\u201d I ask, taking the last soda from the fridge. \u201cYou want ice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you having ice?\u201d</p><p>Dammit, she\u2019s cute. \u201cDo you think I should have ice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you like ice?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s quick. I\u2019m impressed. \u201cIs your ice any good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, do you prefer crushed ice or cubed ice?\u201d</p><p>I almost answer by saying cubed, but realize that wouldn\u2019t be a question. I narrow my eyes and glare at her. \u201cNo ice for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa! I win,\u201d she gloats.</p><p>\u201cI let you win because I feel sorry for you,\u201d I say, making my way back to the stove. \u201cAnyone that snores as bad as you do deserves a break every now and then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, the insults are really only funny when they\u2019re in text form,\u201d she says.</p><p>She stands up and walks to the freezer at the same time I turn around to walk to the refrigerator for the minced garlic. Her back is to me and she\u2019s filling her cup with ice. She turns around when I reach the refrigerator. She looks up at me with those big brown eyes and those pouty lips and I take a step closer to her, hoping I make her flustered again. I love making her flustered.</p><p>I lift my arm and press my palm flat against the refrigerator and look her in the eyes. \u201cYou know I\u2019m kidding, right?\u201d</p><p>She immediately sucks in a rush of air and nods. I grin and move in even closer. \u201cGood. Because you don\u2019t snore. In fact, you\u2019re pretty damn adorable when you sleep.\u201d I don\u2019t know why I told her she didn\u2019t snore. Maybe I don\u2019t want her to know just how long I actually stayed in her bed watching her after she fell asleep last night.</p><p>She tugs on her bottom lip, looking up at me hopefully. Her chest is heaving and her arms are dusted in chills and I wish more than anything I could just grab her face and kiss her. I want to kiss her more than I want air.</p><p>But I already told myself I wouldn\u2019t, so I\u2019m not.</p><p>That doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t have a little fun with her, though. I move my lips until they\u2019re almost touching her ear. \u201cSky. I need you . . .\u201d I pause for a second and wait for her to catch her breath. \u201d. . . to move. I need in the fridge.\u201d I pull back and watch for her reaction. Her palms are flat against the refrigerator behind her like she\u2019s struggling to hold herself upright.</p><p>Seeing her physical reaction to my proximity makes me smile. When I smile and she sees I was purposely teasing her, she narrows her eyes and I laugh.</p><p>She pushes against my chest and shoves me back. \u201cYou\u2019re such an ass!\u201d she says, walking to the bar.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but damn. You\u2019re so blatantly attracted to me, it\u2019s hard not to tease you.\u201d I\u2019m still laughing when I walk back to the stove with the garlic. I pour some into the pan and glance at her. She\u2019s covering her face with her hands from embarrassment and I immediately feel guilty. I don\u2019t want her thinking I\u2019m not into her, because I\u2019m positive I\u2019m into her way more than she\u2019s into me. I guess I haven\u2019t made that very clear to her, though, which is a little unfair.</p><p>\u201cWant to know something?\u201d I ask.</p><p>She looks up at me and shakes her head. \u201cProbably not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might make you feel better,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI doubt it.\u201d</p><p>I look at her and she\u2019s not smiling and I hate it. I meant for this to be lighthearted; I didn\u2019t mean to hurt her feelings. \u201cI might be a little bit attracted to you, too,\u201d I admit, hoping it\u2019ll help her realize that I didn\u2019t mean to embarrass her.</p><p>\u201cJust a little bit?\u201d she asks, teasingly.</p><p>No. Not just a little bit. A whole helluva lot.</p><p>I continue to prepare the food and I\u2019m doing everything I can to get it all started so I can sit and talk with her while it cooks. She just sits silently at the bar, watching me work my way around her kitchen. I love that she\u2019s not modest when it comes to the way she watches me. She stares at me like she doesn\u2019t want to look at anything else and I like it.</p><p>\u201cWhat does lol mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, seriously. You typed it in your text earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means laugh out loud. You use it when you think something is funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s dumb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it is pretty dumb. It\u2019s just habit, though, and the abbreviated texts make it a lot faster to type once you get the hang of it. Sort of like OMG and WTF and IDK and . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God, stop,\u201d she says quickly. \u201cYou speaking in abbreviated text form is really unattractive.\u201d</p><p>I wink at her. \u201cI\u2019ll never do it again, then.\u201d I walk to the counter and pull the vegetables out of the sack. I run them under the water and move the cutting board to the bar in front of her. \u201cDo you like chunky or smooth spaghetti sauce,\u201d I ask, placing the tomato in front of me. She\u2019s looking past me, lost in thought. I wait to see if she\u2019ll answer me when she catches back up, but she just keeps staring off into space. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d I ask her, waving my hand once in front of her eyes. She finally snaps out of it and looks up at me. \u201cWhere\u2019d you go? You checked out for a while there.\u201d</p><p>She shakes it off. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t like her tone of voice. She doesn\u2019t seem fine.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you go, Sky?\u201d I ask her again. I want to know what she was thinking. Or maybe I don\u2019t want to know, because if she was thinking about how she wants me to leave then I hope she continues to pretend she\u2019s fine.</p> <p>\u201cPromise you won\u2019t laugh?\u201d she asks.</p><p>Relief rushes through me because I don\u2019t think she\u2019d ask me that if she was hoping I would leave. But I\u2019m not about to promise her I won\u2019t laugh, so I shake my head in disagreement. \u201cI told you that I\u2019ll only ever be honest with you, so no. I can\u2019t promise I won\u2019t laugh because you\u2019re kind of funny and that\u2019s only setting myself up for failure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you always so difficult?\u201d</p><p>I grin, but don\u2019t respond. I love it when she gets irritated with me, so I don\u2019t give her a response on purpose.</p><p>She straightens up in her chair and says, \u201cOkay, fine.\u201d She inhales a deep breath like she\u2019s preparing for a long speech.</p> <p>I\u2019m nervous.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really not any good at this whole dating thing, and I don\u2019t even know if this is a date, but I know that whatever it is, it\u2019s a little more than just two friends hanging out, and knowing that makes me think about later tonight when it\u2019s time for you to leave and whether or not you plan to kiss me and I\u2019m the type of person who hates surprises so I can\u2019t stop feeling awkward about it because I do want you to kiss me and this may be presumptuous of me, but I sort of think you want to kiss me, too, and so I was thinking how much easier it would be if we just went ahead and kissed already so you can go back to cooking dinner and I can stop trying to mentally map out how our night\u2019s about to play out.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s too soon to love her, but shit. She\u2019s got to stop doing and saying these unexpected things that make me want to fast-forward whatever\u2019s going on between us. Because I want to kiss her and make love to her and marry her and make her have my babies and I want it all to happen tonight.</p><p>But then we\u2019ll be out of firsts, and the firsts are the best part. Good thing I\u2019m patient.</p><p>I set the knife down on the cutting board and look her in the eyes. \u201cThat,\u201d I say, \u201cwas the longest run-on sentence I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t like my comment. She huffs and falls back against her seat in a pout.</p> <p>\u201cRelax.\u201d I laugh. I take a second to finish the sauce and start the pasta and do everything I need to do to get to a point where I can actually talk to her while I\u2019m not trying to cook at the same time. When I finally get the pasta going, I wipe my hands on the dishtowel and place it on the counter. I walk around the bar to where she\u2019s seated.</p><p>\u201cStand up,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>She slowly stands up and I place my hands on her shoulders, then look around the room for a good spot to break the news to her that I\u2019m not going to kiss her tonight. As much as I want to and as much as I now know she wants me to, I still want to wait.</p><p>And I know I told her I\u2019m not mean, but I never said I wasn\u2019t cruel. And I\u2019m just having too much fun watching her when she\u2019s flustered and I really want to make her flustered again. \u201cHmm,\u201d I say, still pretending I\u2019m looking for the perfect spot to kiss her. I glance into the kitchen, then take her by the wrists and pull her with me. \u201cI sort of liked the fridge backdrop.\u201d I push her against the fridge and she lets me. She hasn\u2019t stopped watching me intently the whole time and I love it. I lift my arms to the sides of her head and begin to lean in toward her. She closes her eyes.</p><p>I keep mine open.</p><p>I look at her lips for a moment. Thanks to the peck I stole while she was sleeping last night, I kind of have an idea what they feel like. But now I can\u2019t help but wonder what they taste like. I\u2019m so tempted to lean in a few more inches and see for myself, but I don\u2019t.</p><p>I\u2019ve got this.</p><p>They\u2019re just lips.</p> <p>I watch her for a few more seconds until her eyes flick open when I fail to kiss her. Her whole body jumps when she sees how close I am and it makes me laugh.</p><p>Why do I enjoy teasing her so much?</p><p>\u201cSky?\u201d I say, looking down at her. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to torture you or anything, but I already made up my mind before I came over here. I\u2019m not kissing you tonight.\u201d</p><p>The hope in her expression dwindles almost immediately.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d she says. Her eyes are full of rejection and I absolutely hate it, but I\u2019m still not kissing her. But I do want her to know how much I want to kiss her.</p><p>I bring my hand up to her face and trace a line down her cheek. The feel of her skin beneath my fingertips is like silk. I keep trailing down her jaw, then her neck. My whole body is tense because I\u2019m not sure if she feels all of this the way I do. I can\u2019t imagine someone like Grayson could be lucky enough to touch her face or taste her mouth and that he wouldn\u2019t care if she was even enjoying it or not.</p><p>When my hand reaches her shoulder, I stop and look her in the eyes. \u201cI want to kiss you,\u201d I say. \u201cBelieve me, I do.\u201d</p><p>So, so bad.</p><p>I remove my hand from her shoulder and bring it up to her cheek. She leans into my hand and looks up at me, her eyes full of disappointment. \u201cBut if you really want to, then why don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Ugh. I hate that look. If she keeps looking at me like that I\u2019ll lose every shred of willpower I have left. Which isn\u2019t much.</p><p>I tilt her face up to mine. \u201cBecause,\u201d I whisper. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t feel it.\u201d</p><p>The look on her face when I say it is a mixture of realization and regret. She knows I\u2019m referring to her lack of response to other guys and I\u2019m not sure she knows how to respond. She\u2019s silent, but I just want her to argue with me. I want her to tell me how wrong I am. I want her to tell me she already feels like I do, but instead she just nods and covers my hand with hers.</p><p>I close my eyes, wishing she had responded any other way. But the fact that she didn\u2019t just proves that not kissing her tonight is exactly what needs to happen. I don\u2019t understand why she\u2019s so closed off, but I\u2019ll wait however long I have to. There\u2019s no way I could walk away from this girl now.</p><p>I pull her away from the refrigerator and wrap my arms around her. She slowly returns the embrace by clasping her arms around my waist and conforming to my chest. She willingly leans into me and just feeling her want me to hold her is better than anything I\u2019ve felt this entire year. All she did was hug me back, but little does she know she just knocked a whole lot of life back into me. I press my lips into her hair and inhale. I could stay like this all night.</p><p>But the damn oven timer dings, reminding me that I\u2019m cooking her dinner. If it means having to let her go, I\u2019d rather starve. But I promised to cook for her, so I release my hold from around her and take a step back.</p><p>The embarrassed and almost heartbroken look on her face is the last thing I expect to see. She drops her gaze down at the floor and I realize that I just disappointed her. A lot. All I\u2019m trying to do is go at a pace that\u2019s best for her. I can\u2019t have her thinking that I\u2019m going slow because it\u2019s my choice. Because if she didn\u2019t have whatever issue it is she has with guys, we wouldn\u2019t be standing in this kitchen right now. We\u2019d be back on her bed just like we were last night, only this time she wouldn\u2019t be reading to me.</p><p>I grab both of her hands and interlock our fingers. \u201cLook at me.\u201d She hesitantly lifts her face and looks at me. \u201cSky, I\u2019m not kissing you tonight but believe me when I tell you, I\u2019ve never wanted to kiss a girl more. So stop thinking I\u2019m not attracted to you because you have no idea just how much I am. You can hold my hand, you can run your fingers through my hair, you can straddle me while I feed you spaghetti, but you are not getting kissed tonight. And probably not tomorrow, either. I need this. I need to know for sure that you\u2019re feeling every single thing that I\u2019m feeling the moment my lips touch yours. Because I want your first kiss to be the best first kiss in the history of first kisses.\u201d</p><p>The sadness is gone from her eyes now and she\u2019s actually smiling at me. I lift her hand and kiss it. \u201cNow stop sulking and help me finish the meatballs. Okay?\u201d I ask, wanting reassurance from her that she believes me. \u201cIs that enough to get you through a couple more dates?\u201d</p><p>She nods, still smiling. \u201cYep. But you\u2019re wrong about one thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you want my first kiss to be the best first kiss, but this won\u2019t be my first kiss. You know that.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know how to break it to her, but she hasn\u2019t been kissed before. Not like she deserves, anyway. I hate that she doesn\u2019t realize this, so I take it upon myself to show her exactly what a real kiss feels like.</p><p>I let go of her hands and cup her face, walking her back against the refrigerator. I lean in until I can feel her breath on my lips and she gasps. I love the helpless, hungry look in her eyes right now, but it doesn\u2019t compare to what it does to me when she bites her lip.</p><p>\u201cLet me inform you of something,\u201d I say, lowering my voice. \u201cThe moment my lips touch yours, it will be your first kiss. Because if you\u2019ve never felt anything when someone\u2019s kissed you, then no one\u2019s ever really kissed you. Not the way I plan on kissing you.\u201d</p><p>She exhales a pent-up breath and her arms are covered in chills again.</p><p>She felt that.</p><p>I grin victoriously and back away from her, then turn my attention to the stove. I can hear her sliding down the refrigerator. I turn around and she\u2019s sitting on the floor, looking up at me in shock. I laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d I say with a wink.</p><p>She smiles up at me from the floor and pulls her legs up to her chest with a shrug. \u201cMy legs stopped working.\u201d She laughs. \u201cMust be because I\u2019m so attracted to you,\u201d she says sarcastically.</p><p>I look around the kitchen. \u201cYou think your mother has a tincture for people who are too attracted to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother has a tincture for everything,\u201d she says.</p><p>I walk over and take her hand, then pull her up. I press my hand against the small of her back and pull her against me. She looks up at me with hooded eyes and a small gasp parts her lips. I lower my mouth to her ear and whisper, \u201cWell, whatever you do . . . make sure you never take that tincture.\u201d</p><p>Her chest rises against mine and she\u2019s looking into my eyes like everything I\u2019ve said tonight meant nothing. She wants me to kiss her and she doesn\u2019t care that I\u2019m doing everything in my power not to.</p><p>I slide my hand down her back and slap her on the ass. \u201cFocus, girl. We have food to cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I have one,\u201d she says, placing her cup down on the table.</p><p>We\u2019re playing a game she suggested called Dinner Quest, where no question is off limits and eating and drinking isn\u2019t allowed until the question has been answered. I\u2019ve never heard of it, but I like the thought of being able to ask her anything I want to ask her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy did you follow me to my car at the grocery store?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I shrug. \u201cLike I said, I thought you were someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she says. \u201cBut who?\u201d</p><p>Maybe I don\u2019t want to play this game. I\u2019m not ready to tell her about Hope. I\u2019m definitely not ready to tell her about Les, but there\u2019s no way around it because my answer just dug me into a hole. I shift in my seat and reach for my drink, but she snatches it out of my hands.</p> <p>\u201cNo drinks. Answer the question first.\u201d She sets my drink back down on the table and waits for my explanation. I really don\u2019t want to go into my screwed up past, so I try to keep my answer simple.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure who you reminded me of,\u201d I lie. \u201cYou just reminded me of someone. I didn\u2019t realize until later that you reminded me of my sister.\u201d</p><p>She makes a face and says, \u201cI remind you of your sister? That\u2019s kind of gross, Holder.\u201d</p><p>Oh, shit. That\u2019s not at all what I meant. \u201cNo, not like that. Not like that at all, you don\u2019t even look anything like she did. There was just something about seeing you that made me think of her. And I don\u2019t even know why I followed you. It was all so surreal. The whole situation was a little bizarre, and then running into you in front of my house later . . .\u201d</p><p>Should I really tell her how that made me feel? How I thought for sure Les had something to do with it or that it was divine intervention or a freaking miracle? Because I honestly feel like it was too perfect to be chalked up to coincidence.</p> <p>\u201cIt was like it was meant to happen,\u201d I finally say.</p><p>She inhales a deep breath and I look up at her, afraid of how forward that might have been. She smiles at me and points to my drink. \u201cYou can drink now,\u201d she says. \u201cYour turn to ask me a question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, this one\u2019s easy. I want to know whose toes I\u2019m stepping on. I received a mysterious inbox message from someone today. All it said was, \u2018If you\u2019re dating my girl, get your own prepaid minutes and quit wasting mine, jackass.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be Six,\u201d she says, smiling. \u201cThe bearer of my daily doses of positive affirmation.\u201d</p><p>Thank God.</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you\u2019d say that. Because I\u2019m pretty competitive, and if it came from a guy, my response would not have been as nice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou responded? What\u2019d you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that your question? Because if it isn\u2019t, I\u2019m taking another bite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold your horses and answer the question,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cYes, I responded to her text. I said, \u2018How do I buy more minutes?\u2019\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks redden and she grins. \u201cI was only joking, that wasn\u2019t my question. It\u2019s still my turn.\u201d</p><p>I drop my fork onto my plate and sigh at her stubbornness. \u201cMy food\u2019s getting cold.\u201d</p><p>She ignores my feigned irritation and she leans forward, looking me directly in the eyes. \u201cI want to know about your sister. And why you referred to her in the past tense.\u201d</p><p>Ah, shit. Did I refer to her in the past tense? I look up at the ceiling and sigh. \u201cUgh. You really ask the deep questions, huh?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s how the game is played. I didn\u2019t make up the rules.\u201d</p><p>I guess there\u2019s no getting out of this explanation. But honestly, I don\u2019t mind telling her. There are certain things about my past I\u2019d rather not discuss, but Les doesn\u2019t really feel like my past. She still feels very much a part of my present.</p><p>\u201cRemember when I told you my family had a pretty fucked-up year last year?\u201d</p><p>She nods, and I hate that I\u2019m about to put a damper on our conversation. But she doesn\u2019t like vague, so . . . \u201cShe died thirteen months ago. She killed herself, even though my mother would rather we use the term \u2018purposely overdosed.\u2019\u201d</p><p>I keep my eyes locked on hers, waiting for the \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d or the \u201cIt was meant to happen,\u201d to come out of her mouth like it comes out of everyone else\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhat was her name?\u201d she asks. The fact that she even asks like she\u2019s genuinely interested is unexpected.</p><p>\u201cLesslie. I called her Les.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas she older than you?\u201d</p><p>Only by three minutes. \u201cWe were twins,\u201d I say, right before I take a bite.</p><p>Her eyes widen slightly and she reaches for her drink. I intercept her this time.</p><p>\u201cMy turn,\u201d I say. Now that I know nothing is off limits, I ask her about the one thing she didn\u2019t really want to talk about yesterday. \u201cI want to know the story about your dad.\u201d</p><p>She groans, but plays along. She knows she can\u2019t refuse to answer that question, because I just completely opened up to her about Les.</p><p>\u201cLike I said, I haven\u2019t seen him since I was three. I don\u2019t have any memories of him. At least, I don\u2019t think I do. I don\u2019t even know what he looks like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mom doesn\u2019t have any pictures of him?\u201d</p><p>She cocks her head slightly, then leans back in her seat. \u201cYou remember when you said my mom looked really young? Well, it\u2019s because she is. She adopted me.\u201d</p><p>I drop my fork.</p><p>Adopted.</p><p>The genuine possibility that she could be Hope bombards my thoughts. It wouldn\u2019t make sense that she was three when she was adopted, though, because Hope was five when she was taken. Unless she\u2019s been lied to.</p><p>But what are the chances? And what are the chances that someone like Karen would be capable of stealing a child?</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asks. \u201cYou\u2019ve never met anyone who was adopted?\u201d</p><p>I realize the shock I\u2019m feeling in my head and my heart is also registering in my expression. I clear my throat and try to regroup, but a million more questions are forming in my mind. \u201cYou were adopted when you were three? By Karen?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cI was put into foster care when I was three, after my biological mother died. My dad couldn\u2019t raise me on his own. Or he didn\u2019t want to raise me on his own. Either way, I\u2019m fine with it. I lucked out with Karen and I have no urge whatsoever to go figure it all out. If he wanted to know where I was, he\u2019d come find me.\u201d</p><p>Her mother is dead? Hope\u2019s mother is dead.</p><p>But Hope was never put into foster care and Hope\u2019s dad didn\u2019t put her up for adoption. It all makes absolutely no sense, but at the same time I can\u2019t rule out the possibility. She\u2019s either been fed complete lies about her past, or I\u2019m going insane.</p><p>The latter is more likely.</p><p>\u201cWhat does your tattoo mean?\u201d she asks, pointing at it with her fork.</p><p>I look down at my arm and touch the letters that make up Hope\u2019s name.</p><p>If she was Hope, she would remember the name. That\u2019s the only thing that stops me from believing in the possibility that she could be Hope.</p><p>Hope would remember.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a reminder,\u201d I say. \u201cI got it after Les died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA reminder for what?\u201d</p><p>And this is the only answer she\u2019ll get that\u2019s vague, because I\u2019m definitely not about to explain. \u201cIt\u2019s a reminder of the people I\u2019ve let down in my life.\u201d</p><p>Her expression grows sympathetic. \u201cThis game\u2019s not very fun, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really not.\u201d I laugh. \u201cIt sort of sucks ass. But we need to keep going because I still have questions. Do you remember anything from before you were adopted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. Bits and pieces, but it comes to a point that, when you don\u2019t have anyone to validate your memories, you just lose them all. The only thing I have from before Karen adopted me is some jewelry, and I have no idea who it came from. I can\u2019t distinguish now between what was reality, dreams, or what I saw on TV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember your mother?\u201d</p><p>She pauses for a moment. \u201cKaren is my mother,\u201d she says flatly. I can tell she doesn\u2019t want to talk about it and I don\u2019t want to push her. \u201cMy turn. Last question, then we eat dessert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think we even have enough dessert?\u201d I say, trying to lighten the mood.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you beat him up?\u201d she says, darkening the mood completely.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to get into that one. I push my bowl away. I\u2019ll just let her win this round. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to know the answer to that, Sky. I\u2019ll take the punishment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I do want to know.\u201d</p><p>Just thinking about that day already has me worked up again. I pop my jaw to ease the tension. \u201cLike I told you before, I beat him up because he was an asshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s vague,\u201d she says, narrowing her eyes. \u201cYou don\u2019t do vague.\u201d</p><p>I know that I like her stubbornness, but I only like it when she\u2019s not pushing me to bring up the past. But I also have no clue what she\u2019s been told about the whole situation. I\u2019ve made it a point to get her to open up to me and ask me questions so she can hear the truth from me. If I refuse to answer her, then she\u2019ll stop opening up.</p><p>\u201cIt was my first week back at school since Les died,\u201d I say. \u201cShe went to school there, too, so everyone knew what happened. I overheard the guy saying something about Les when I was passing him in the hallway. I disagreed with it, and I let him know. I took it too far and it came to a point when I was on top of him that I just didn\u2019t care. I was hitting him, over and over, and I didn\u2019t even care. The really fucked-up part is that the kid will more than likely be deaf out of his left ear for the rest of his life, and I still don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>My fist is clenched on the table. Just thinking about the way everyone acted after she died has me pissed off all over again.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say about her?\u201d</p><p>I lean back in my chair and my eyes drop to the table between us. I don\u2019t really feel like looking her in the eyes when I\u2019m only thinking about stuff that infuriates me. \u201cI heard him laughing, telling his friend that Les took the selfish, easy way out. He said if she wasn\u2019t such a coward, she would have toughed it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToughed what out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think she took the easy way out.\u201d She doesn\u2019t say it like it\u2019s a question. She says it like she\u2019s truly trying to understand me. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve wanted from her all week. I just want her to understand me. To believe me and not everyone else.</p><p>And no. I don\u2019t think she took the easy way out. I don\u2019t think that at all.</p><p>I reach across the table and pull her hand between both of mine. \u201cLes was the bravest fucking person I\u2019ve ever known,\u201d I say. \u201cIt takes a lot of guts to do what she did. To just end it, not knowing what\u2019s next? Not knowing if there\u2019s anything next? It\u2019s easier to go on living a life without any life left in it than it is to just say \u2018fuck it\u2019 and leave. She was one of the few that just said, \u2018fuck it.\u2019 And I\u2019ll commend her every day I\u2019m still alive, too scared to do the same thing.\u201d</p><p>I look at her after I\u2019m finished speaking and her eyes are wide. Her hand is shaking, so I clasp my hands around hers. We look at each other for several seconds and I can tell she has no idea what to say to me. I attempt to lighten the mood and change the subject. She said that was the last question, then we get dessert. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I lean forward and kiss the top of her head, then walk into the kitchen. \u201cYou want brownies or cookies?\u201d I watch her from the kitchen as I grab the desserts and she\u2019s staring at me, wide-eyed.</p><p>I freaked her out.</p><p>I just completely freaked her out.</p><p>I walk back to where she\u2019s seated and I kneel down in front of her. \u201cHey. I didn\u2019t mean to scare you,\u201d I tell her, taking her face in my hands. \u201cI\u2019m not suicidal if that\u2019s what\u2019s freaking you out. I\u2019m not fucked up in the head. I\u2019m not deranged. I\u2019m not suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. I\u2019m just a brother who loved his sister more than life itself, so I get a little intense when I think about her. And if I cope better by telling myself that what she did was noble, even though it wasn\u2019t, then that\u2019s all I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m just coping.\u201d I allow her time to let my words sink in, then finish my explanation. \u201cI fucking loved that girl, Sky. I need to believe that what she did was the only answer she had left, because if I don\u2019t, then I\u2019ll never forgive myself for not helping her find a different one.\u201d I press my forehead to hers, looking her firmly in the eyes. \u201cOkay?\u201d</p> <p>I need her to understand that I\u2019m trying. I might not have it together and I might not know how to move past Les\u2019s death, but I\u2019m trying.</p><p>She presses her lips together and nods, then pulls my hands away. \u201cI need to use the bathroom,\u201d she says, quickly slipping around me. She rushes to the bathroom and shuts the door behind her.</p><p>Jesus Christ, why did I even go there? I walk to the hallway, prepared to knock on the door and apologize, but decide to give her a few minutes first. I know that was really heavy. Maybe she just needs a minute.</p><p>I wait across the hallway until the bathroom door opens up again. It doesn\u2019t look like she\u2019s been crying.</p><p>\u201cWe good?\u201d I ask her, taking a step closer to her.</p> <p>She smiles up at me and exhales a shaky breath. \u201cI told you I think you\u2019re intense. This just proves my point.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s already herself again. I love that about her.</p><p>I smile and wrap my arms around her, then rest my chin on top of her head while we make our way to her bedroom. \u201cAre you allowed to get pregnant yet?\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cNope. Not this weekend. Besides, you have to kiss a girl before you can knock her up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid someone not have sex education when she was homeschooled? Because I could totally knock you up without ever kissing you. Want me to show you?\u201d</p><p>She falls onto the bed and picks up the book that she read to me last night. \u201cI\u2019ll take your word for it,\u201d she says. \u201cBesides, I\u2019m hoping we\u2019re about to get a hefty dose of sex education before we make it to the last page.\u201d</p> <p>I lie down beside her and pull her to me. She rests her head on my chest and begins reading to me.</p><p>I ball my hand up into a tight fist and keep it at my side, doing everything in my power not to touch her mouth. I\u2019ve just never seen anything so perfect before.</p><p>She\u2019s been reading for well over half an hour now and I haven\u2019t heard a damn word she\u2019s said. Last night it was so much easier to pay attention to the actual story because I wasn\u2019t looking directly at her. Tonight it\u2019s taking every ounce of willpower I have not to claim her mouth with mine. She\u2019s propped against me with her head on my chest, using me as her pillow. I\u2019m hoping she can\u2019t feel my heart pounding right now because every time she glances up at me when she flips a page, I squeeze my fists even tighter and try to keep my hands to myself but my resistance resonates in my pulse. And it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to touch her. I want to touch her and kiss her so bad it physically hurts.</p><p>I just don\u2019t want it to be insignificant to her. When I touch her . . . I want her to feel it. I want every single thing I say to her and every single thing I do to her to have significance.</p><p>Last night when she told me she\u2019s never felt anything when she was kissed, my heart did this crazy thing where it felt bound, like it was being constricted, just like the lungs in my chest. I\u2019ve dated a lot of girls, even though I might have downplayed that to her. With every single girl I\u2019ve been with, my heart has never reacted like it reacts to her. And I\u2019m not referring to my heart\u2019s feelings for her, because let\u2019s be honest, I barely know her. I\u2019m referring to my heart\u2019s literal, physical reaction to her. Every time she speaks or smiles or, God forbid, laughs . . . my heart reacts like it\u2019s been sucker-punched. I hate it and like it and somehow have become addicted to it. Every time she speaks, the sucker-punch in my chest reminds me that there\u2019s still something there.</p><p>A huge internal part of me was lost when I lost Hope, and I was convinced Les took the very last contents of my chest with her when she died last year. After being with Sky these last two days, I\u2019m not so sure about that, anymore. I don\u2019t think my chest has been empty this whole time like I thought. Whatever is left inside me has just been asleep, and she\u2019s somehow slowly waking it up.</p><p>With every word she speaks and every glance she sends my way, she\u2019s unknowingly pulling me out of this thirteen-year-long nightmare I\u2019ve been trapped in, and I want to continue to allow her to pull me.</p><p>Fuck it.</p> <p>I unclench my fist and bring it up to her hair that\u2019s spilled across my chest. I pick up a loose strand and curl it around my finger, keeping my eyes trained on her mouth while she reads to me. I find myself still comparing her to Hope every now and then, despite my efforts not to. I\u2019m trying to recall exactly what Hope\u2019s eyes looked like or if she had the same four freckles across the bridge of her nose that Sky has. Every time I start to compare them, I force myself to stop. It doesn\u2019t matter anymore and I need to let it go. Sky has proved that she can\u2019t be Hope and I have to accept it. The odds of the girl I lost being right here, pressed against my chest, her strand of hair between my fingertips . . . it\u2019s impossible. I need to separate the two of them in my head before I screw up and do something stupid, like refer to Sky by the wrong name.</p><p>That would suck.</p><p>I notice her lips are pressed into a tight, thin line and she isn\u2019t speaking anymore. It\u2019s a damn shame because her mouth is fucking hypnotizing.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you stop talking?\u201d I ask her, without looking at her eyes. I keep my gaze trained on her lips, hoping they start moving again.</p><p>\u201cTalking?\u201d she says, her top lip curling up in a grin. \u201cHolder, I\u2019m reading. There\u2019s a difference. And from the looks of it, you haven\u2019t been paying a lick of attention.\u201d</p><p>The feistiness in her reply makes me smile. \u201cOh, I\u2019ve been paying attention,\u201d I say, lifting up onto my elbows. \u201cTo your mouth. Maybe not to the words coming out of it, but definitely to your mouth.\u201d I slide out from under her until she\u2019s on her back, then I scoot down until I\u2019m beside her. I pull her against me and take her hair between my fingertips again. The fact that she doesn\u2019t resist in the slightest only means I\u2019ll be at war with myself the rest of the damn night. She\u2019s already made it clear she wants me to kiss her, and I\u2019ll be damned if backing away from having her pressed up against the refrigerator wasn\u2019t the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever had to do.</p><p>Shit. Just thinking about it is almost as intense as when it was actually happening.</p><p>I drop the strand of hair and watch as my fingers fall straight to her lips. I don\u2019t know how the last five seconds just occurred, but I\u2019m looking down at my hand as it grazes over her mouth like I have no control over my limbs anymore. My hand has a mind of its own but I really don\u2019t care . . . nor do I want to stop it.</p><p>I feel her breath against my fingertips and I have to bite the inside of my cheek to center my focus on something other than what I want. Because it\u2019s not my wants that are important right now\u2014it\u2019s hers. And I highly doubt she wants to taste my mouth as much as I need to taste hers right now.</p><p>\u201cYou have a nice mouth,\u201d I say, still slowly tracing it with the tips of my fingers. \u201cI can\u2019t stop looking at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should taste it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s quite lovely.\u201d</p><p>Holy shit.</p><p>I squeeze my eyes shut and drop my head to her neck, forcing my focus away from those lips. \u201cStop it, you evil wench.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cNo way. This is your stupid rule; why should I be the one to enforce it?\u201d</p><p>Oh, Jesus. It\u2019s a game to her. This whole not kissing thing is a game to her and she\u2019s going to tease the hell out of me. I can\u2019t do this. If I give in and kiss her before she\u2019s ready I know I won\u2019t be able to stop. And I don\u2019t know what the hell is going on inside my chest right now but I really like the way it feels when I\u2019m around her. If I can drag whatever this is out to make sure she feels the same way, then that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019ll do. Even if it takes me weeks to ensure she gets to that point, then I guess I\u2019ll wait weeks. In the meantime, I\u2019ll do whatever I can to make sure her next first is anything but insignificant.</p><p>\u201cBecause you know I\u2019m right,\u201d I say, explaining exactly why she needs to help me enforce this rule. \u201cI can\u2019t kiss you tonight because kissing leads to the next thing, which leads to the next thing, and at the rate we\u2019re going we\u2019ll be all out of firsts by next weekend. Don\u2019t you want to drag our firsts out a little longer?\u201d I pull away from her neck and look down at her, very aware that there is less space between our mouths right now than between our bodies.</p><p>\u201cFirsts?\u201d she says, looking up at me curiously. \u201cHow many firsts are there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t that many, which is why we need to drag them out. We\u2019ve already passed too many since we met.\u201d</p><p>She tilts her head and her expression grows attractively serious. \u201cWhat firsts have we already passed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe easy ones,\u201d I say. \u201cFirst hug, first date, first fight, first time we slept together, although I wasn\u2019t the one sleeping. Now we barely have any left. First kiss. First time to sleep together when we\u2019re both actually awake. First marriage. First kid. We\u2019re done after that. Our lives will become mundane and boring and I\u2019ll have to divorce you and marry a wife who\u2019s twenty years younger than me so I can have a lot more firsts and you\u2019ll be stuck raising the kids.\u201d I bring my hand to her cheek and smile at her. \u201cSo you see, babe? I\u2019m only doing this for your benefit. The longer I wait to kiss you, the longer it\u2019ll be before I\u2019m forced to leave you high and dry.\u201d</p><p>She laughs and the sound is so toxic I\u2019m forced to swallow the huge lump in my throat so I can make room to breathe again.</p><p>\u201cYour logic terrifies me,\u201d she says. \u201cI sort of don\u2019t find you attractive anymore.\u201d</p><p>Challenge accepted.</p><p>I slowly slide on top of her, careful to hold my weight up with my hands. If my body were to touch any part of hers right now, we\u2019d already be moving on to seconds and thirds. \u201cYou sort of don\u2019t find me attractive?\u201d I say, staring straight down into her eyes. \u201cThat can also mean you sort of do find me attractive.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her eyes grow dark and she shakes her head. I can see the dip in the base of her throat barely move as she gulps before speaking. \u201cI don\u2019t find you attractive at all. You repulse me. In fact, you better not kiss me because I\u2019m pretty sure I just threw up in my mouth.\u201d</p><p>I laugh, then drop onto my elbow so I can move closer to her ear, still careful not to touch any other part of her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a liar,\u201d I whisper. \u201cYou\u2019re a whole lot attracted to me and I\u2019m about to prove it.\u201d</p><p>I had every intention of pulling away, but as soon as the scent of her hits me, I can\u2019t pull back. My lips are pressed against her neck before I even have a chance to weigh the decision. But right now it feels a hell of a lot more like a necessity to taste her rather than just a decision. She gasps when I pull back and I can\u2019t help but hope that her gasp was genuine. The thought of her actually feeling what I felt when my lips touched her neck makes me feel ridiculously victorious. It\u2019s too bad I like a challenge, because that gasp just made me want to up my game. I drop my mouth back to her ear and whisper, \u201cDid you feel that?\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes are closed and she\u2019s shaking her head no, breathing heavily. I look down at her chest, heaving dangerously close to mine.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to do it again?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>I want her to beg me to do it again, but she shakes her head no. She\u2019s breathing twice as fast as she was sixty seconds ago, so I know I\u2019m getting to her. I laugh that she\u2019s so adamantly shaking her head no, while at the same time clenching the sheet next to her with her fist. I move closer to her mouth because I suddenly have an overwhelming need to take in some of the breaths she\u2019s wasting. It feels like I need them more than she does right now, so I inhale at the same time my lips meet her cheek. I don\u2019t stop there, though. I can\u2019t stop there. I continue to trail kisses from her cheek, down to her ear. I pause and catch my breath enough to speak in a steady voice. \u201cHow about that?\u201d</p><p>Again, she stubbornly shakes her head, but tilts it back and slightly to the left, allowing me better access. I lift my hand from the bed and bring it to her waist, keeping my eyes trained on her as I slip my hand under her shirt, just far enough to graze her stomach with my thumb. I watch for any kind of reaction from her, but she\u2019s got a stern, tight-lipped expression on her face now, like she\u2019s trying to hold her breath. I don\u2019t want her to hold her breath. I need to hear her breathe.</p><p>When I drop my mouth and nose to her jawline, she releases her pent-up breaths just like I was hoping she would. I trail my nose across her jaw, inhaling the scent of her, then move down, listening intently to every single gasp that escapes her lips as if they\u2019re the last sounds I\u2019ll ever hear. When I reach her ear, four of my senses are in overdrive and one is seriously lacking\u2014taste. I know I can\u2019t taste her mouth tonight, but I have got to taste at least one part of her. I press my lips to her ear and she immediately brings her hand up to my neck, pulling me in deeper. Feeling her need my mouth against her skin rips my chest wide open and I completely give in, wanting to feel that need from her even more. I immediately part my lips and glide my tongue across her skin, taking in the sweetness of her and locking it in my memory. I\u2019ve never tasted anything that rivaled perfection like she does.</p> <p>Then she moans and holy hell. Everything I thought I previously knew about my desires or wants or needs becomes lost in that sound. From this point forward, my new and only goal in life is to find a way to get her to make that exact same sound again.</p><p>I bring my hand to the side of her head and completely let loose, kissing and teasing every inch of her neck, trying to find that exact spot that got to her a few seconds ago. She drops her head against her pillow and I take the opportunity to explore more of her neck. As soon as my lips begin to trail toward the rise in her chest, I force myself north again, not wanting to push it to the point that she asks me to stop. Because I absolutely don\u2019t want to stop whatever this is we\u2019re doing.</p><p>Her eyes are still closed and I drop my mouth to her lips, kissing her softly near the corner of her mouth.</p><p>And there it is. The softest, most delicate sound escapes her throat again. I can\u2019t ignore the fact that another part of me wakes up with that sound. I continue kissing a full circle around the edges of her lips, impressed that I\u2019m somehow able to find strength to pull back.</p><p>I have to stop for a moment because if I don\u2019t, I\u2019ll for sure break my one and only rule tonight\u2014which is absolutely no mouth contact. I know if I kiss her right now it\u2019ll be great. But I don\u2019t want her to have great. I want her to have incredible. Looking at her lips right now, I know for a fact it\u2019ll be incredible for me.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re so perfect,\u201d I say. \u201cLike hearts. I could literally stare at your lips for days and never get bored.\u201d</p> <p>She opens her eyes and smiles. \u201cNo. Don\u2019t do that. If all you do is stare, then I\u2019ll be the bored one.\u201d</p><p>Damn that smile. It\u2019s painful having to watch that mouth smile and frown and pout and laugh and speak when all I want to watch it do is kiss me.</p><p>But then she licks her lips and everything I thought I just knew about pain actually starts to feel good compared to the way my heart is gouged out of my chest with that small tease. Jesus Christ, this girl.</p><p>I groan and press my forehead to hers. Having her mouth this close to mine sucks the self-control right out of me. I drop myself on top of her and it\u2019s as if a rush of warm air swarms the room and encircles us. We both feel everything simultaneously and we moan together, move together, and breathe together.</p><p>Then we completely give in together. All four of our hands are frantically pulling off my shirt as if two hands can\u2019t do it fast enough. As soon as it\u2019s off, her legs lock around my waist and she pulls me tightly against her. I drop my forehead back to hers and move against her, finding a new way to force those tiny sounds from her mouth that have quickly become my new favorite song. We continue to move together and the more she gasps and quietly moans, the closer my lips move to hers, wanting to experience those sounds first-hand. I just need a tiny sample of what her kiss will feel like. A little preview, that\u2019s all. I allow my lips to brush against hers and we both suck in a breath.</p><p>She feels it. She actually fucking feels this right now and I think I\u2019m drowning in satisfaction. I don\u2019t want to speed things up and I definitely don\u2019t want to slow things down. I just want to keep things exactly as they are right now because it\u2019s perfect.</p><p>I bring my hand to the side of her head and keep my forehead pressed against hers, my lips resting against hers. I love the feel of our mouths sliding together, so I pull back and lick my lips to create smoother traction. I straighten my legs out, taking some of my weight off my knees, not expecting the small shift to do what it does to her. She arches her back and whispers, \u201cOh, God.\u201d</p><p>I feel like I should answer her, because it sure as hell seems like she\u2019s referring to me right now with the way she throws her arms around my neck and tucks her head against me. Her arms are trembling and her legs are clenching my waist and I realize that not only is she feeling this right now, she\u2019s doing everything in her power to fight it.</p> <p>\u201cHolder,\u201d she whispers, clenching my back. I\u2019m not sure if she\u2019s wanting me to answer her or not, but I forgot how to speak so it doesn\u2019t matter. I can barely even remember how to breathe right now.</p><p>\u201cHolder.\u201d</p><p>She says my name with more urgency this time so I kiss the side of her head and slow my movements against her. She hasn\u2019t asked me to stop or slow down yet, but I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s what she\u2019s about to do. I do whatever I can to intercept her plea because she feels incredible and I absolutely don\u2019t want to stop.</p><p>\u201cSky, if you\u2019re asking me to stop, I will. But I\u2019m hoping you\u2019re not, because I really don\u2019t want to stop, so please.\u201d I lift up and look down at her, still barely moving against her. She still hasn\u2019t asked me to stop yet and honestly, I\u2019m afraid to. I\u2019m afraid if I stop, then whatever she\u2019s feeling right now will disappear. That scares me because I know that with me, I\u2019ll be feeling her for days after this. I love knowing that what I\u2019m doing to her right now is having enough of an effect that she feels she needs me to stop before she passes an unexpected first tonight.</p><p>I reach to her cheek and stroke it with the back of my hand, wanting . . . no, needing for her to pass this first tonight. \u201cWe won\u2019t go any further than this, I promise,\u201d I say to her. \u201cBut please don\u2019t ask me to stop where we already are. I need to watch you and I need to hear you because the fact that I know you\u2019re actually feeling this right now is so fucking amazing. You feel incredible and this feels incredible and please. Just . . . please.\u201d</p><p>I drop my mouth to hers and kiss her softly, immediately pulling back before that amazing connection turns into more than just a peck. Her lips feel so inconceivable perfect; I have to lift off her completely in order to regain my bearings. Otherwise, I won\u2019t be able to hold myself at bay for another second. I look down at her and she\u2019s looking back up at me, searching my eyes for an answer to a question she can only answer for herself. I wait patiently for her to decide where we go from here.</p><p>Her head begins to shake back and forth and she places her hands on my chest.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Whatever you do, don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>I remain still for a few seconds, repeating what she just said in my head several times until I\u2019m absolutely certain she just told me not to stop. I slip my hand behind her neck and pull her forehead to mine. \u201cThank you,\u201d I say breathlessly. I ease myself back down on top of her until we recapture our rhythm. She feels so incredible pressed against me, I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ll ever be the same again. This girl just raised the bar so far above all other girls\u2019 heads, no one could ever come close.</p><p>I kiss her everywhere my lips have already touched her tonight, picking up pace with the timing of her gasps and moans. When I feel her body tensing around mine I pull away from her neck and look down at her. She digs her nails deeper into my skin, then tilts her head back and closes her eyes. She looks absolutely beautiful like this, but I need her eyes on mine. I need to watch her feel this.</p><p>\u201cOpen your eyes,\u201d I tell her. She winces, but doesn\u2019t look up at me. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes immediately open beneath me when I say please. Her eyebrows crease together and she loses all rhythm to her breathing pattern. She\u2019s fighting to breathe now as her body begins to tremble beneath me, all the while keeping our gaze locked together. All I can do is hold my breath and watch the most incredible thing I\u2019ve ever seen unfold beneath me. When the loudest of her moans has escaped her lips, she can no longer keep her eyes open. As soon as she closes them, I drop my lips back to hers, needing to feel them against mine again. When she\u2019s finally calm, I move my lips down to her neck and kiss it like I wish I could be kissing her mouth right now.</p><p>But seeing how much she needs me to kiss her mouth right now is making the wait even more important for me. Considering what just happened between us, it almost seems absurd to keep up the assurance of not kissing her. But I\u2019m stubborn and I like knowing that the next time we\u2019re together like this; we\u2019ll be able to experience another first that\u2019s likely to drive me even more insane than tonight has. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I press my lips to her shoulder and push up on my arm. I trail my fingers down her hairline and wipe away the loose strands from her face. She looks absolutely content and it\u2019s the most beautiful, satisfying thing I\u2019ve ever felt.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re incredible,\u201d I say, knowing that word is a severe understatement for what she actually is. She smiles at me and inhales a deep breath at the same time I do. I collapse beside her on the bed, needing to get off her immediately. My chest is completely alive right now and the only thing that I know could satisfy me is to be pressed against her again with my mouth on hers. I force the image of it out of my mind and attempt to cool myself off by matching my breathing pattern with hers.</p><p>After silently finding a stable enough point to touch her again, I move my hand closer to hers on the bed and wrap my pinky around hers. The sensation of her pinky in mine feels way too familiar. Way too right. Way too long overdue. I squeeze my eyes shut and attempt to deny my conscience the satisfaction of being right.</p><p>She\u2019s Sky. That\u2019s who she is. I only doubt this because of how she feels so familiar. Familiarity is hardly enough to convince me otherwise.</p> <p>I hope my instincts are wrong, because if I\u2019m right, the truth will destroy her.</p><p>Please, just let her be Sky.</p><p>My fear of being right keeps pushing through and I sit up on the bed, needing to separate myself from her. I need to clear my head of all this craziness. \u201cI have to go,\u201d I say, looking down at her. \u201cI can\u2019t be on this bed with you for another second.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m being honest. I can\u2019t be on this bed with her for another second, although I\u2019m sure she thinks it\u2019s for other reasons. Not for the reason I really need to separate myself from her\u2014the fact that I\u2019m terrified my intuition is finally right for once.</p><p>I stand and pull my shirt over my head and notice that she\u2019s looking at me like I\u2019m rejecting her. I know she probably thought I\u2019d end up kissing her tonight, but she\u2019s got a lot to learn when it comes to doubting my word.</p> <p>I lean in close to her and smile reassuringly. \u201cWhen I said you weren\u2019t getting kissed tonight, I meant it. But dammit, Sky. I had no idea how fucking difficult you would make it.\u201d I slip my hand behind her neck and lean in to kiss her cheek. When she gasps, it takes everything I have to release my hold and climb off the bed. I watch her as I walk toward the window and pull my phone from my pocket. I send her a quick text, then wink at her, right before I climb outside. I pull the window shut and back a few steps away. As soon as the window is shut, she jumps off her bed and runs out of her bedroom, more than likely to go grab her phone and check her text. Normally, her excitement would more than likely make me laugh. Instead I find myself staring blankly through her bedroom window. My heart feels heavy and my mind even heavier as the pieces of the puzzle slowly begin to fit together, right down to her name.</p><p>\u201cThe sky is always beautiful . . .\u201d</p><p>The memory causes me to flinch. I brace my hand against the brick wall and inhale a deep breath. It\u2019s almost laughable, really\u2014the fact that I can sit here and entertain the possibility that this could actually happen after thirteen years. If it were true . . . if she really were her . . . it would ruin her. Which is exactly why I refuse to accept it without tangible proof\u2014something I can actually touch that would confirm it. Without tangible proof, she\u2019ll remain Sky to me.</p><p>I just want her to be Sky.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Les,</p> <p>Remember when we were kids and I made everyone stop calling me Dean? I never have told anyone the truth about why I go by Holder, not even you.</p><p>We were eight years old and it was the first and only time we ever went to Disneyland. We were waiting in line for one of the roller-coasters and you and Dad were in front of me because you couldn\u2019t ride it by yourself. I was a few inches taller than you and it pissed you off that I was able to ride most of the rides alone and you weren\u2019t.</p><p>When we made it to the front of the line, they put you and Dad on first and I had to wait for the next car to pull in. I was standing there alone, patiently waiting. I turned around to find Mom and she was about a hundred yards away at the exit to the ride, waiting for all of us to finish. I waved at her and she waved back at me. I turned back around when the next car pulled up.</p><p>That\u2019s when I heard her.</p><p>I heard Hope yelling my name. I spun around and stood on my tiptoes, facing the sound of her voice.</p><p>\u201cDean!\u201d she yelled. She sounded really far away, but I knew it was her because she said it with that accent of hers. She always dragged out the middle of my name and made it longer than one syllable. I always liked how she said my name, so hearing her yell it, I knew it was her. She must have spotted me and now she was trying to call for me to come help her.</p><p>\u201cDean,\u201d she yelled again, only this time she sounded farther away. I could hear the panic in her voice. I began to panic myself, because I knew I\u2019d get in trouble if I lost my place in line. Mom and Dad spent the entire week before we left reminding us to stay by one of them at all times.</p><p>I glanced over at Mom but she wasn\u2019t looking at me, she was watching you and Dad on the ride. I didn\u2019t know what to do, because she wouldn\u2019t know where I was if I left the line. But as soon as Hope screamed my name again I didn\u2019t care. I had to find her.</p> <p>I started running toward the back of the line\u2014toward the sound of her voice. I was yelling her name, hoping she would hear me and walk toward the sound of my voice.</p><p>God, Les. I was so excited. I was terrified and excited and knew that all our prayers had been answered, but it was up to me to hurry up and find her and I was scared I wouldn\u2019t be able to. She was here and I couldn\u2019t get to her fast enough.</p><p>I had it all planned out in my head. As soon as I found her, I would hug the hell out of her first, then I was going to grab her hands and pull her back to where Mom was standing. We were going to wait by the exit to the ride so when you walked off, she would be the first thing you would see.</p><p>I knew how happy you were going to be when you saw her. Neither of us had been truly happy in the two years since she was taken and this was our chance. After all, Disneyland is the happiest place on earth, and for the first time, I was starting to believe it.</p><p>\u201cHope!\u201d I yelled, cupping my hands around my mouth. I had been running for several minutes, still trying to listen for the sound of her voice. She would yell my name, then I would yell her name, and this went on for what felt like forever until someone grabbed my arm and yanked it, stopping me in my tracks. Mom threw her arms around me and hugged me, but I was trying to get out of her grasp.</p><p>\u201cDean, you can\u2019t run off like that!\u201d she said. She was kneeling down, shaking my shoulders, looking me frantically in the eyes. \u201cI thought I lost you.\u201d</p><p>I pulled away from her and tried to keep running toward Hope, but Mom wouldn\u2019t let go of my shoulders. \u201cStop it!\u201d she said, confused why I was trying to get away from her.</p><p>I looked back at her in a panic and shook my head vigorously, trying to catch my breath and find the words. \u201cIt\u2019s . . .\u201d I pointed toward the direction I wanted to run. \u201cIt\u2019s Hope, Mom! I found Hope! We have to go to her before I lose her again.\u201d</p><p>Sadness instantly reached her eyes and I knew she didn\u2019t believe me. \u201cDean,\u201d she whispered, shaking her head sympathetically. \u201cSweetie.\u201d</p><p>She felt sorry for me. She didn\u2019t believe me, because this wasn\u2019t the first time I thought I\u2019d found her. But I knew I was right this time. I knew it.</p><p>\u201cDean!\u201d Hope cried again. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d She was much closer this time and I could tell by the sound of her voice that she was crying now. Mom\u2019s eyes darted toward the voice and I knew she heard her calling for me, too.</p><p>\u201cWe have to find her, Mom,\u201d I pleaded. \u201cIt\u2019s her. That\u2019s Hope.\u201d</p><p>Mom looked me in the eyes and I could see the fear in them. She nodded, then grabbed my hand.</p><p>\u201cHope?\u201d she yelled, scanning over the crowd. We were both calling her name now and I remember looking up at Mom at one point, watching her while she helped me search. I loved her more than I ever had in that moment, because she actually believed me.</p><p>We heard my name called again and it was so much closer this time. Mom looked down at me and her eyes were wide. We both broke out into a run toward the sound of Hope\u2019s voice. We pushed through the crowd and . . . that\u2019s when I saw her. Her back was to us and she was standing all by herself.</p><p>\u201cDean!\u201d she yelled again.</p><p>Mom and I were both frozen. We couldn\u2019t believe it. She was standing right in front of us, looking for me. After two years of not knowing who took her or where she was, we had finally found her. I started to walk forward, but I was suddenly shoved aside by a teenage boy rushing toward her. When he reached her, he grabbed her by the arm and spun her around.</p><p>\u201cAshley! Thank God!\u201d he said, pulling her to him.</p><p>\u201cDean,\u201d she said to the boy, wrapping her arms around his neck. \u201cI got lost.\u201d</p><p>He picked her up. \u201cI know, sis. I\u2019m so sorry. You\u2019re okay now.\u201d</p><p>She pulled her tear-streaked face away from his chest and she glanced in our direction.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t Hope.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t Hope at all.</p><p>And I wasn\u2019t the Dean she was looking for.</p><p>Mom squeezed my hand and knelt down in front of me. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Dean,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought it was her, too.\u201d</p><p>A sob broke free from my chest and I cried. I cried so damn hard, Les. Mom wrapped her arms around me and she started crying, too, because I don\u2019t think she knew that an eight-year-old could have his heart crushed like that.</p><p>But I was crushed. My heart broke all over again that day.</p><p>And I never wanted to hear the name Dean again.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>I practically skip down the stairs and into the kitchen. It\u2019s the second Monday of school and just thinking about my attitude when I woke up last week as opposed to this morning makes me laugh. I never in a million years imagined I\u2019d be so consumed with the thought of a girl as I have been. Since the second I left her house Saturday night, I\u2019ve done nothing but eat, breathe, and sleep with her on my mind.</p><p>\u201cSo how are you liking Sky?\u201d my mom asks. She\u2019s seated at the kitchen table eating her breakfast and reading the paper. I\u2019m surprised she remembers her name. I only mentioned her once. I shut the refrigerator door and walk to the bar.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s great,\u201d I say. \u201cI like her a lot.\u201d</p><p>My mom puts down the paper and cocks her head. \u201cShe?\u201d she says with an arched eyebrow. I don\u2019t understand her confusion. I just stare at her until she shakes her head and laughs. \u201cOh, Jesus,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019ve got it bad.\u201d</p><p>Still confused. \u201cWhat do you mean? You asked how I liked Sky and I answered you.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s laughing even harder now. \u201cI said school, Holder. I asked how you were liking school.\u201d</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Maybe I do have it bad.</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d I laugh, embarrassed.</p><p>She stops laughing and picks the newspaper up, holding it out in front of her. I grab my drink and my backpack and head toward the door. \u201cWell?\u201d she asks. \u201cHow do you like school?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I roll my eyes at her. \u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d I say, backing out of the kitchen. \u201cBut I like Sky more.\u201d</p><p>I walk to the car and shove my backpack inside. I wish I had thought to offer to pick her up today, but after spending most of Sunday texting back and forth, we agreed that we would take things slow. We decided not to run together in the mornings. She said it would be too much, too soon, and I definitely want to keep it at her pace, so I agreed. However, I can\u2019t deny the fact that I was a little disappointed that she wants to run alone. I want to be around her every second of the day, but I also know she\u2019s right. We spent one weekend together and it already feels like I\u2019ve connected with her on a much deeper level than with any other girl I\u2019ve dated. It\u2019s a good feeling, but it also scares the hell out of me.</p><p>Before I back out of the driveway, I pull my phone out and text her.</p><p>I don\u2019t know if your ego needs deflating today. I\u2019ll judge for myself when I finally get to see you in fifteen minutes.</p> <p>I set my phone down and back out of the driveway. When I make it to the first stop sign, I pick my phone back up and text her again.</p><p>Fourteen minutes.</p><p>I keep the phone in my hand and text her again when another minute has passed.</p><p>Thirteen minutes.</p><p>I do this every minute until I pull into the school parking lot and all the minutes have passed.</p> <p>When I reach the classroom I peek through the window of the door. She\u2019s seated in the back of the room next to a conveniently empty desk. My pulse kicks up a notch just from seeing her again. I open the door and walk inside and her face immediately lights up with a smile as soon as she sees me.</p><p>I reach the back of the room and begin to lay my backpack down on the empty desk at the same time some dude tries to set his drinks down. I look at him and he looks at me, then we both look at Sky, because I don\u2019t want to shove him away until she gives me permission.</p><p>\u201cLooks like we have quite the predicament here, boys,\u201d she says with an adorable grin. She looks at the coffee being held in the hands of the guy standing next to me. \u201cI see the Mormon brought the queen her offering of coffee. Very impressive.\u201d She looks at me and arches an eyebrow. \u201cDo you wish to reveal your offering, hopeless boy, so that I may decide who shall accompany me at the classroom throne today?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s teasing me. I love it. And now that I think about it, this must be the guy she\u2019s been sitting with at lunch all week. One look at his hot pink shoes and matching pants relieves me of any worry that he\u2019s about to become my competition.</p><p>I pick up my backpack and let him have the seat. \u201cLooks like someone\u2019s in need of an ego-shattering text today.\u201d I take an empty seat in the row in front of her.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations, squire,\u201d she says to the guy with the coffee. \u201cYou are the queen\u2019s chosen one today. Sit. It\u2019s been quite the weekend.\u201d</p> <p>He takes a seat, but he\u2019s eyeing her curiously. It\u2019s clear by the look on his face that he has no idea what happened between Sky and me this weekend. \u201cBreckin, this is Holder,\u201d Sky says, introducing me to him. \u201cHolder is not my boyfriend, but if I catch him trying to break the record for best first kiss with another girl, then he\u2019ll soon be my not breathing nonboyfriend.\u201d</p><p>Oh, don\u2019t worry, babe. I\u2019m not about to try and break that record with anyone but you.</p><p>I smile at her. \u201cLikewise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHolder, this is Breckin,\u201d she says, gesturing her hand toward him. \u201cBreckin is my new very bestest friend ever in the whole wide world.\u201d</p><p>If he\u2019s Sky\u2019s best friend, then I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s about to become my second-best friend. I reach my hand out to him. Breckin is cautious as he returns the handshake, then he turns to Sky and lowers his voice. \u201cDoes not-your-boyfriend realize I\u2019m Mormon?\u201d</p><p>Sky smiles and nods. \u201cIt turns out, Holder doesn\u2019t have an issue with Mormons at all. He just has an issue with assholes.\u201d</p><p>Breckin laughs and I\u2019m still trying to process if Mormon really means Mormon in this case, because it sure sounds like code for something else entirely.</p><p>\u201cWell, in that case, welcome to the alliance,\u201d Breckin says to me.</p> <p>I look down at the coffee cup on his desk. If Mormon means Mormon, that better be decaf. \u201cI thought Mormons weren\u2019t allowed to have caffeine,\u201d I say to him.</p><p>Breckin shrugs. \u201cI decided to break that rule the morning I woke up gay.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. I think I like this Mormon.</p><p>Sky leans back in her seat and smiles at me. It feels good to get the approval from the only friend she seems to have here. Mr. Mulligan walks in so I lean toward Sky before he starts his lecture. \u201cWait for me after class?\u201d</p><p>She smiles and nods.</p><p>When we reach her locker, it\u2019s lined with sticky notes again.</p><p>Assholes.</p><p>I wad them up and drop them on the floor, just as I always do when I pass her locker. She switches her books, then turns to face me. \u201cYou trimmed your hair,\u201d she says.</p><p>I\u2019m not even about to admit how hard it is to find a barber open on Sunday.</p><p>\u201cYeah. This chick I know couldn\u2019t stop whining about it. It was really annoying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like it,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>She smiles at me and clutches her books to her chest. I can\u2019t stop thinking about Saturday night and how I\u2019d give anything to be back in her room with her right now. Why the hell didn\u2019t I kiss her? I\u2019m kissing her today, dammit. After school. Or during school if I can get away with it. Or right now.</p><p>\u201cI guess we should get to class,\u201d she says, glancing past me.</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d I agree. We really probably should get to class but she\u2019s not in my next class so I really have no urge to get to class.</p><p>She stares at me a little while longer. Long enough for me to mentally map out a plan. I know it\u2019s Monday, but I want to take her out tonight. That way I\u2019ll have to walk her to her door. Then once we get to her front door, I\u2019m going to kiss her crazy for at least half an hour just like I should have done Saturday night.</p><p>She kicks off the locker and begins to walk away, but I grab her arm and pull her back. I push her up against the locker and she gasps while I block her in with my arms.</p><p>She\u2019s flustered again.</p><p>I reach my hand up to her face and slide it under her jaw, then run my thumb across her bottom lip. I can feel her chest heave against mine and her breaths come in quicker succession.</p><p>\u201cI wish I had kissed you Saturday night,\u201d I whisper, staring down at her mouth. She parts her lips and I continue to run my thumb across them. \u201cI can\u2019t stop imagining what you taste like.\u201d I press my thumb to the center of her lips and I quickly lean in and kiss her. I pull away just as fast, though, because that tease just about kills me. Her eyes are closed and I release her face and walk away.</p><p>I\u2019m pretty sure I just became the master of willpower, because walking away from that mouth was one of the hardest things I\u2019ve ever done.</p><p>\u201cHey, whisker biscuit,\u201d Daniel says, cutting in line to stand in front of me.</p><p>\u201cWhisker biscuit?\u201d I sigh and shake my head. I swear I don\u2019t know where he comes up with this shit.</p><p>\u201cWell, you don\u2019t like it when I call you Hopeless. Or cunt nugget. Or piss flap. Or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could just call me Holder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone else calls you Holder and I hate everyone else, so no. I can\u2019t.\u201d He takes two empty trays and hands me one. He nods in the direction of Sky\u2019s table. \u201cSo, I hope your ditching me Saturday night for cheese tits over there was worth it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer name is Sky,\u201d I correct.</p><p>\u201cWell I can\u2019t call her Sky. Everyone else calls her Sky and I hate everyone else, so . . .\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cWell then why do you call Valerie by her name?\u201d</p><p>He spins around. \u201cWho\u2019s Valerie?\u201d he asks, looking at me like I\u2019ve lost my mind.</p><p>\u201cVal? Your ex-girlfriend? Or current girlfriend. Whatever she is.\u201d</p><p>Daniel laughs. \u201cNo, man. Her name isn\u2019t Valerie, it\u2019s Tessa.\u201d</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>\u201cI call her Val because it\u2019s short for Valium and I always tell her she needs to take that shit by the bucketful. I wasn\u2019t lying when I said she was fucking crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you call anyone by their actual name?\u201d</p><p>He ponders my question for a second, then looks at me, confused. \u201cWhy would I want to do that?\u201d</p><p>I give up. \u201cI\u2019m sitting with Sky today,\u201d I tell him. \u201cYou want to sit with us?\u201d</p><p>Daniel shakes his head. \u201cNah. Val\u2019s having a good day so I better take advantage of it.\u201d He takes his change from the cafeteria cashier. \u201cSee you later, buttshark.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m kind of relieved he\u2019s sitting with Val. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ready for Sky to get a dose of Daniel yet. I pay for my food and walk toward their table. When I reach them, it sounds like Sky is giving Breckin a recap of our weekend. Breckin sees me walk up behind her but he just winks and doesn\u2019t let her know I\u2019m listening.</p><p>\u201cHe showed up at my house on Friday and after quite a few misunderstandings, we finally came to an understanding that we just misunderstood each other. Then we baked, I read him some smut, and he went home. He came back over Saturday night and cooked for me. Then we went to my room and . . .\u201d</p><p>I drop my tray down beside hers and take a seat. \u201cKeep going,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019d love to hear what we did next.\u201d</p><p>She shoots me a quick grin when she sees my tray beside hers, then she rolls her eyes and turns back to Breckin. \u201cThen we broke the record for best first kiss in the history of first kisses without even kissing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpressive,\u201d Breckin says.</p><p>\u201cIt was an excruciatingly boring weekend,\u201d I say.</p><p>Breckin shoots me a look like he wants to kick my ass for insulting Sky. He just scored major points for that one.</p><p>\u201cHolder loves boring,\u201d Sky clarifies. \u201cHe means that in a nice way.\u201d</p><p>Breckin picks up his fork and looks back and forth between us. \u201cNot much confuses me. But you two are an exception.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s not the only one confused by us. I\u2019m seriously confused by us. I\u2019ve never felt this comfortable with a girl before and we aren\u2019t even dating. We haven\u2019t even kissed. Although I did give her one hell of a nonkiss. Just thinking about it has me anxious. \u201cYou busy tonight?\u201d</p><p>She wipes her mouth with her napkin. \u201cMaybe,\u201d she says, smiling.</p><p>I wink at her, knowing that\u2019s her stubborn way of saying she\u2019s not busy.</p><p>\u201cWas it the smut I let her borrow that she read to you?\u201d Breckin asks.</p><p>\u201cSmut?\u201d I laugh. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was smut, but I didn\u2019t catch most of the book because my mind was a little sidetracked.\u201d</p><p>Sky slaps me on the arm. \u201cYou let me read for three hours straight and you weren\u2019t even paying attention?\u201d</p><p>I throw my arm over her shoulder and pull her to me, then kiss her on the side of the head. \u201cI already told you I was paying attention,\u201d I whisper in her ear. \u201cJust not to the words coming out of your mouth.\u201d I turn back to Breckin. \u201cI did catch some of it, though. Not a bad book. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever be interested in a romance novel but I\u2019m curious how that dude\u2019s gonna find a way out of that shit.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Breckin agrees and brings up a part of the plot. We begin talking about the book and I can\u2019t help but notice how quiet Sky is the whole time I\u2019m talking with Breckin. I keep glancing at her but she\u2019s zoned out, just like when she zoned out in her kitchen Saturday night. After a while of her not talking or even taking a bite of her food, I become concerned that something is wrong.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d I ask, turning my attention toward her. She doesn\u2019t even blink. I snap my fingers in front of her face. \u201cSky,\u201d I say a little louder. Her eyes finally jerk up to mine and she snaps out of it. \u201cWhere\u2019d you go?\u201d I ask, concerned.</p><p>She smiles, but looks embarrassed by the fact that she just zoned out. I reach up and cup her cheek, running my thumb reassuringly back and forth. \u201cYou have to quit checking out like that. It freaks me out a little bit.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cSorry. I\u2019m easily distracted.\u201d She smiles and pulls my hand away from her face, giving it a reassuring squeeze. \u201cReally, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p> <p>I look down at her hand that\u2019s now holding mine. I see the familiar half of a silver heart dangling from beneath her sleeve, so I immediately flip her hand over and twist her wrist back and forth.</p><p>She\u2019s wearing Les\u2019s bracelet.</p><p>Why the hell is she wearing Les\u2019s bracelet?</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you get that?\u201d I ask her, still looking at the bracelet that sure as hell shouldn\u2019t be on her wrist right now.</p><p>She looks down at her hand and shrugs like it\u2019s not a big deal.</p> <p>She just shrugs?</p><p>She shrugs like she doesn\u2019t give a shit that she just completely knocked the breath out of me. How can she be wearing this bracelet? It\u2019s Les\u2019s bracelet. The last time I saw this bracelet it was on Les\u2019s wrist.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you get it?\u201d I demand.</p><p>She\u2019s looking at me now like she\u2019s terrified of the person in front of her. I realize I\u2019m holding on to her wrist with a tight grip so I release it, just as she pulls away from me.</p><p>\u201cYou think I got it from a guy?\u201d she asks, confused.</p><p>No, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s from a guy. Christ. I don\u2019t think that at all. What I think is that she\u2019s wearing my dead sister\u2019s bracelet and she\u2019s refusing to tell me how she got it. She can\u2019t just shrug and sit here, acting like it\u2019s a coincidence, because that bracelet is handmade and there\u2019s only one other bracelet like it in the whole damn world. So unless she\u2019s Hope, then she\u2019s somehow wearing Les\u2019s bracelet and I want to know why the hell she\u2019s wearing it!</p> <p>Unless she\u2019s Hope.</p><p>The truth hits me head-on and I think I\u2019m about to be sick. No, no, no.</p><p>\u201cHolder,\u201d Breckin says, shifting forward. \u201cEase up, man.\u201d</p><p>No, no, no. This can\u2019t be Hope\u2019s bracelet. How could she even still have it after all this time? Her words from Saturday night rush through my head.</p><p>\u201cThe only thing I have from before Karen adopted me is some jewelry, and I have no idea who it came from.\u201d</p><p>I lean forward, praying this bracelet isn\u2019t the jewelry she was referring to. \u201cWho gave you the damn bracelet, Sky?\u201d</p><p>She gasps, still unable to give me an answer. She can\u2019t answer me because she honestly has no idea. She\u2019s looking at me like I just crushed her and hell . . . I think I did.</p><p>I know she doesn\u2019t have a clue what\u2019s going through my mind right now, but how could I even begin to tell her? How in the hell do I explain to her that she may not know where the bracelet on her wrist came from, but I do? How do I tell her that bracelet came from Les? From the best friend she doesn\u2019t even remember? And how do I admit that she got that bracelet just minutes before I walked away from her? Minutes before her entire life was ripped out from under her?</p> <p>I can\u2019t tell her. I can\u2019t tell her, because she honestly has no memory of me or Les or how she got this damn bracelet. From looking at her, I don\u2019t even think she remembers Hope. She doesn\u2019t even remember herself. She said Saturday night she has no memory of her life before Karen.</p><p>How can she not remember? How can anyone not remember being stolen from her own home? From her best friend?</p><p>How can she not remember me?</p><p>I squeeze my eyes shut and turn away from her. I press my palms against my forehead and inhale a deep breath. I have got to calm down. I\u2019m terrifying her right now and that\u2019s the last thing I want to do. I grip the back of my neck in order to keep my hands busy so that I don\u2019t punch the table.</p><p>She\u2019s Hope. Sky is Hope and Hope is Sky and, \u201cShit!\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t mean to say it out loud, because I know I\u2019m freaking her out. But this is as calm as I\u2019m able to be right now. I have to get out of here. I have to figure out how the hell to explain this to her.</p><p>I stand up and rush toward the exit to the cafeteria before I do or say anything else. As soon as I\u2019m through the doors and alone in the hallway, I collapse against the nearest locker, and pull my trembling hands to my face.</p><p>\u201cShit, shit, shit!\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>Les,</p><p>I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t find her sooner. I can\u2019t help but wonder if it would have made a difference. I\u2019m so sorry.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Les,</p><p>She still has your bracelet, though. That has to mean something to you.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>Les,</p><p>I don\u2019t know what to do. It\u2019s been over six hours now and I keep trying to figure out if I should go to her house and tell her everything or if I should give it more time.</p><p>I think I\u2019ll give it more time. I need to process this.</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>Les,</p><p>What if I call Karen and explain everything to her? Sky seems to have a good relationship with her. Karen could figure out what to do.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-one</p><p>Les,</p><p>Shit. What if Karen is the one who did it?</p><p>Chapter Twenty-two</p><p>Les,</p><p>What if I tell Mom? I could tell Mom and she could figure out what we need to do or if we need to call the police. She\u2019s a lawyer. I\u2019m sure she deals with this kind of stuff all the time.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-three</p><p>Les,</p><p>I can\u2019t tell Mom. Mom\u2019s in intellectual property law. She wouldn\u2019t know what to do any more than I do.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-four</p><p>Les,</p><p>It\u2019s almost midnight. Twelve hours I\u2019ve let this continue without giving her a single explanation for what happened at lunch today. God, I hope I didn\u2019t make her cry.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-five</p><p>Les,</p><p>She\u2019s probably asleep right now. I\u2019ll tell her in the morning. She runs every morning so I\u2019ll just show up and run with her, then I\u2019ll tell her. We\u2019ll figure out what to do after that.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-six</p><p>Les,</p><p>I can\u2019t sleep.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe I actually found her.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-seven</p><p>Les,</p><p>Why do you think she calls herself Sky?</p><p>There was this thing we used to do when we were little. We only did it a few times because she was taken shortly after that. But she used to cry all the time and I hated it, so we would lie in the driveway and watch the sky and I would hold on to her finger. I remember thinking it was gross to hold a girl\u2019s hand so I would always hold her pinky, instead. Because even though I was just a kid and it was gross to hold a girl\u2019s hand, I really did want to hold her hand.</p><p>I used to tell her to think about the sky when she got sad and she always promised me she would. Now here she is. And her name is Sky.</p><p>It\u2019s three in the morning. None of this makes any sense. I\u2019m going to sleep now.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-eight</p><p>Les,</p><p>Well, I ran with her. Sort of. It was more like I chased her. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to speak to her once I showed up. Then after the run we were both so exhausted we just collapsed onto the grass.</p><p>I was hoping that the incident in the cafeteria yesterday would spark some sort of memory from her. I was hoping when I showed up today that she would know exactly what upset me so much yesterday. I wanted her to tell me she remembered so I wouldn\u2019t have to be the one to tell her.</p><p>How do you tell someone something like that, Les? How do I tell her that the mother who raised her could very well be the one who stole her from us?</p><p>If I said anything, her life would change forever. And she likes her life. She likes running and reading and baking and . . . holy shit.</p><p>Holy shit.</p><p>It didn\u2019t make sense until just now, but the whole internet thing? Her mom not wanting her to have a phone? Karen did it. Karen fucking took her and she\u2019s doing everything she can to make sure Sky doesn\u2019t find out.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what to do. I know I can\u2019t be around her right now. There\u2019s no way I can be around her and pretend everything is fine when it\u2019s not. But there\u2019s no way I can tell her the truth, either, because it would turn her world upside down.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what will be more painful. Staying away from her so she doesn\u2019t find out, or telling her the truth and ruining her life all over again.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-eight-and-a-half</p><p>Les,</p><p>It\u2019s Thursday night. I haven\u2019t spoken to her since Monday. I can\u2019t even look at her because it hurts so much. I still don\u2019t know what to do and the longer I just let this go on, the more of an asshole it makes me look. But every time I work up the nerve to talk to her I have no idea what I\u2019d even say. I told her I\u2019d always be honest with her and this is just something I can\u2019t be honest with her about.</p><p>I\u2019ve been trying to figure out why Karen would do something like this, but there isn\u2019t a single valid excuse in the whole world that could justify someone taking a child. I\u2019ve even thought about the chance that maybe Hope\u2019s dad didn\u2019t really want her, so he just gave her away. But I know that\u2019s not true because he did everything he could to find her for months.</p><p>I just can\u2019t figure it out. I don\u2019t even know if I need to. Until I barged into her life two weeks ago, she was happy. If I don\u2019t walk away now, it\u2019ll ruin all that.</p><p>Ironic, isn\u2019t it? I walked away from her thirteen years ago and ruined her life. Now if I decide not to walk away from her, I\u2019ll ruin her life again.</p><p>Just goes to show that everything I do is hopeless. Fucking hopeless.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-nine</p><p>\u201cYo, flipdick. We on for tonight?\u201d Daniel says, walking up to my locker.</p><p>The last thing I feel like doing tonight is going out. I know Daniel would probably get my mind off her with all the crazy shit that comes out of his mouth, but I don\u2019t really want to get my mind off her. I haven\u2019t spoken to her since Monday and the only thing that sounds appealing besides being with her is wallowing alone in self-pity.</p><p>\u201cMaybe tomorrow. I don\u2019t really feel like doing anything tonight.\u201d</p><p>Daniel leans his elbow into the locker and he lowers his head, leaning toward me. \u201cYou\u2019re really being a mangina,\u201d he says. \u201cYou didn\u2019t even date the chick. Get the fuck over it and . . .\u201d Daniel glances over my shoulder without finishing the sentence. \u201cWhat the hell is your problem, powder puff?\u201d He\u2019s speaking to someone now standing behind me. The way he says it can only mean it\u2019s Grayson. Fearing I\u2019m about to get sucker-punched from behind, I spin around. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It\u2019s not Grayson.</p><p>Breckin is facing me and he doesn\u2019t look very pleased about it.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to you,\u201d he says. I know he wants to talk about Sky and I really don\u2019t want to talk about Sky. Not to Breckin, not to Daniel, not even to Sky. No one understands anything about anything and frankly, it\u2019s nobody\u2019s business.</p> <p>\u201cSorry, Breckin. I\u2019m not really in the mood to talk about her.\u201d</p><p>Breckin takes a quick step forward and I take a quick step back because I wasn\u2019t expecting him to rush me like he just did. My back is against the locker and Daniel is laughing. Probably because Breckin is a good fifty pounds lighter than I am and several inches shorter and he\u2019s probably wondering why the hell I haven\u2019t laid Breckin on his ass yet. But that doesn\u2019t stop Breckin from moving in even closer and shoving his finger hard against my chest.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really give a shit what kind of mood you\u2019re in, because I\u2019m in a pretty shitty mood myself, Holder. You aren\u2019t the one having to pick up all the shattered pieces of Sky this week. I don\u2019t know what the hell happened in the cafeteria Monday, but it was enough to show me that I don\u2019t like you. I don\u2019t like you one goddamn bit and I have no idea what Sky sees in you . . . because what you did to her? How you led her on for days and then just walked away like she was a waste of your time?\u201d Breckin shakes his head, still fuming. He drops his eyes down to my arm. Down to the tattoo. \u201cI feel sorry for you,\u201d he sighs. He inhales a calming breath and slowly looks back up at me. \u201cI feel sorry for you, because people like her don\u2019t come along more than once. She deserves someone who realizes that. Someone who appreciates her. Someone who would never just . . .\u201d he shakes his head, looking at me disappointedly. \u201cSomeone who would never crush her hope and then just walk away.\u201d</p><p>Breckin backs up a step when he\u2019s finished and Daniel gives me the look. The look that indicates he\u2019s ready to start one of his fights. Before I even have the chance to tell Daniel to refrain, he begins to lunge forward toward Breckin. I quickly step in between them and shove Daniel against the locker with my arm, keeping it pressed against his chest. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I say, holding Daniel back.</p><p>\u201cLet him hit me,\u201d Breckin says loudly from behind me. \u201cOr better yet, why don\u2019t you just do it, Holder? You proved to Sky on Monday what a badass you are. Have at it!\u201d</p> <p>I release Daniel and turn around to face Breckin. The last thing I want to do is hit him. Why would I hit him when everything he just said to me was the absolute truth? He\u2019s pissed at me because of how I treated Sky. He\u2019s pissed and he\u2019s protecting her and I have no idea how to tell him how much it means to me to know she has him.</p><p>I turn around and open my locker, then grab my backpack and car keys. Daniel is watching me closely, wondering why I\u2019m not kicking Breckin\u2019s ass right now. I face Breckin again and he\u2019s eyeing me with just as much confusion as Daniel. I begin to walk away, but pause when I\u2019m shoulder to shoulder with Breckin. \u201cI\u2019m glad she has you, Breckin.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t respond. I pull my backpack onto my shoulder and walk away.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-nine-and-a-half</p><p>Les,</p><p>I haven\u2019t spoken to her in two weeks. I\u2019m still going to school, though, because I can\u2019t imagine the thought of not being able to see her every day. But I just watch her from a distance. I hate that she seems sad now.</p> <p>I was hoping that my actions in the cafeteria last Monday would have left her pissed off, if even a little bit. But when I decided it was better not to allow myself back into her life, I was hoping her anger would help her get over me faster. But she doesn\u2019t seem angry. She just seems heartbroken and that crushes me.</p><p>I made a list over the weekend of the pros and cons of telling her the truth about who she is. I\u2019ll share it with you so you\u2019ll understand my decision better, because I know it doesn\u2019t make sense.</p><p>Pros to telling Sky the truth:</p><p>Her family deserves to know what happened to her and that she\u2019s okay.</p><p>She deserves to know what happened.</p><p>Cons to telling Sky the truth:</p><p>The truth would ruin the life she has now.</p><p>She never seemed happy to me when we were little, but she seems happy now. Forcing her back into a life she doesn\u2019t even remember doesn\u2019t seem like the right thing to do.</p> <p>If she found out I knew all along who she was, she would never forgive me for keeping it from her.</p><p>I know she thinks her birthday is next week, but she still has months to go before she actually turns eighteen. If she finds out right now, the decision about what happens to her will be made for her by her father and the state. When she finds out the truth, I want her to be old enough to make her own decisions about what happens to her life.</p><p>As much as I don\u2019t want to believe Karen did this, what if she did? If the truth came out, Karen would be punished. And that probably should be listed in pros, but I just don\u2019t think her going to prison would in any way be a pro for Sky.</p><p>So you can see the cons won, which is why I\u2019ve decided not to tell her the truth. Not yet, anyway. After I decided I wasn\u2019t going to tell her what happened to her as a child, I also thought about whether it was a good idea to at least try and apologize for what happened at lunch that day. I thought that somehow I could still keep the secret until she\u2019s out of high school and in the meantime, we could be together. I want to be with her again more than anything, but there are so many reasons why I shouldn\u2019t be.</p><p>Pros to being with Sky</p><p>I fucking miss her. I miss her rude comments, her laughter, her smile, her scowl, her cookies, her brownies, her kiss. (Even though I never really had that one. I know I\u2019d miss it if I did.)</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t be as heartbroken if I would just apologize. We could go back to whatever it was that we were doing and I could pretend she wasn\u2019t Hope. It would be cruel, but at least she\u2019d be happy.</p><p>Cons to being with Sky</p><p>Being around her could trigger her memory. I\u2019m not sure that I\u2019m ready for her to remember me yet.</p><p>Once she finds out the truth, she\u2019ll hate me for deceiving her. At least if I\u2019m not with her, she\u2019ll be able to respect the fact that I didn\u2019t lie to her while I was allowing her to fall in love with me.</p><p>If I spend any time with her, I know I\u2019ll slip up. I\u2019ll call her Hope or I\u2019ll say something about when we were kids or I\u2019ll talk too much about you and that could spark a memory.</p><p>How could I ever introduce her to Mom? I\u2019m pretty sure with as much time as Hope spent at our house, Mom would immediately recognize her.</p><p>I\u2019ll do something to fuck it all up again. That\u2019s the only thing I seem to be consistent at in this life. Fucking things up for you and Hope.</p><p>If I walk out of her life completely, she can go on living the contented life she\u2019s been living for the past thirteen years.</p><p>If I stay, I\u2019ll inevitably have to tell her the truth. And no matter how much she probably needs to hear the truth; it\u2019ll turn her world upside down. I can\u2019t watch that, Les. I just can\u2019t.</p><p>So there you have it in big, bold ink. I\u2019m not telling her the truth and I\u2019m not letting her forgive me. She\u2019s better off without me. She\u2019s better off keeping the past in the past and keeping me at a distance.</p><p>Chapter Thirty</p><p>I grab the sack from the floorboard and walk to the front door, then ring the doorbell. I don\u2019t know if this is a good idea. In fact, I know it\u2019s not a good idea. But for whatever reason I trust him to do this for me.</p><p>The front door opens and a woman, more than likely his mother, is standing in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cIs Breckin here?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>She starts at the top of my head, then slowly scrolls down my entire body, stopping at my shoes. It\u2019s not the kind of scroll a guy gets from a woman who\u2019s checking him out. It\u2019s a scroll of disapproval. \u201cBreckin isn\u2019t expecting company,\u201d she says coldly.</p><p>Okay. I didn\u2019t anticipate this obstacle.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Mom,\u201d I hear Breckin say as he opens the door further. \u201cHe\u2019s not here for my gay parts.\u201d</p><p>Breckin\u2019s mother scoffs, then rolls her eyes and walks away while I\u2019m trying to hold back my laughter. Breckin is now standing in her place, scrolling over me disapprovingly just like she did. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>I shift my feet, feeling a little uncomfortable at how unwelcome I am at this house. \u201cI want a couple of things,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m here to apologize, for one. But I\u2019m also here to ask you for a favor.\u201d</p><p>Breckin arches an eyebrow. \u201cI told my mother you weren\u2019t here for my gay parts, Holder. So go ahead and apologize, but I\u2019m not doing you any favors.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. I love that he can be so pissed, yet make fun of himself at the same time. That\u2019s such a Les thing to do. \u201cCan I come in?\u201d I ask. I feel pretty damn awkward on the porch right now and I don\u2019t really want to have this conversation standing in a doorway. Breckin steps back and opens the door farther.</p><p>\u201cThat better be an apology gift,\u201d he says, indicating the sack in my hand. He doesn\u2019t look back or invite me to follow him as he makes his way toward the hallway, so I shut the front door and glance around, then follow him. He opens the door to his bedroom and I walk in behind him. He points to a chair. \u201cSit there,\u201d he says firmly. He walks to his bed and takes a seat on the edge of it, facing me. I slowly take a seat in the chair and he rests his elbows on his knees and clasps his hands in front of him, looking me straight in the eyes. \u201cI take it you\u2019ll be apologizing to Sky next? After you leave here? Because she\u2019s the one you really need to be apologizing to.\u201d</p><p>I set the sack down at my feet and lean back in the chair. \u201cYou\u2019re really protective of her, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Breckin shrugs indifferently. \u201cWell, with all the assholes treating her like shit, someone has to watch out for her.\u201d</p><p>I purse my lips into a tight line and nod, but don\u2019t say anything right away. He stares at me for a while, more than likely attempting to figure out the motive behind my being here. I blow out a quick breath, then begin with what I came here to say.</p><p>\u201cListen, Breckin. I\u2019m probably not going to make a whole lot of sense, but hear me out, okay?\u201d</p><p>Breckin straightens up at the same time he rolls his eyes. \u201cPlease tell me you\u2019re about to explain what the hell happened in that cafeteria. We\u2019ve tried to analyze your behavior no less than a dozen times, but you don\u2019t make any sense.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you what happened, Breckin. I can\u2019t. All I can tell you is that Sky means more to me than you could ever comprehend. I screwed up and it\u2019s too late to go back and make it right with her. I don\u2019t want her forgiveness because I don\u2019t deserve it. You and I both know she\u2019s better off without me. But I needed to come here and apologize to you because I know just from watching you how much you care about her. It kills me that I hurt her but I know that my hurting her indirectly hurt you, too. So, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I keep my eyes trained on his.

I don\u2019t want her to know it\u2019s from me. Just tell her you got it for her. I know she\u2019ll like it.\u201d I take the e-reader out of the sack and toss it to him. He catches it, then looks down at it.</p><p>He stares at it for a few minutes, then flips it over and looks at the back of it. He tosses it on the bed beside him, then clasps his hands together again, staring down at the floor. I wait for him to speak because I\u2019ve said everything I came here to say.</p><p>\u201cCan I just say one thing?\u201d he says, lifting his gaze.</p> <p>I nod. I figured he\u2019d have way more than just one thing to say after all that.</p><p>\u201cI think what pissed me off the most is the fact that I liked her with you,\u201d he says. \u201cI liked seeing how happy she was that day. And even though it was just thirty minutes that I watched you with her at lunch before you went and flipped the fuck out,\u201d he says, waving his arm in the air, \u201cit just seemed so right. You seemed right for her and she seemed right for you and . . . I don\u2019t know, Holder. You just don\u2019t make any sense. You didn\u2019t make sense when you walked away from her that day and you sure aren\u2019t making any sense right now. But I can tell you care about her. I just don\u2019t understand you. I don\u2019t understand you at all and it pisses me off because if there\u2019s one thing in the world I\u2019m good at, it\u2019s understanding people.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t counting while he was talking, but I\u2019m pretty sure that was more than just one thing. \u201cCan you just trust that I really do care about her?\u201d I say. \u201cI want what\u2019s best for her and although it kills me that I\u2019m not what\u2019s best for her, I want to see her happy.\u201d</p><p>Breckin smiles, then reaches beside him and picks up the e-reader. \u201cWell, I think once I give her this awesome present I spent my life savings on, she\u2019ll forget all about Dean Holder. I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019ll be all about sawdust and sunshine once she dives into the books I\u2019m about to load on here.\u201d</p><p>I smile, even though I have no idea what he means by sawdust and sunshine.</p> <p>Chapter Thirty-and-a-half</p><p>Les,</p><p>Breckin is pretty cool. You would like him. I went to his house Friday night and gave him the gift I bought for Sky. We talked things out for a while and I don\u2019t think he wants to kick my ass anymore. Not that he could have. But that\u2019s what solidified my respect for him. The fact that he was so mad he wanted to fight me, even though he knew there wasn\u2019t a chance in hell he would win.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure how going over there would turn out, but I ended up staying until almost midnight. I\u2019ve never really been into video games, but we played Modern Warfare and it was nice just letting my mind take a break for a while. Although I\u2019m not sure how much of a break it took because Breckin made it a point to bring up how much I talked about Sky. He doesn\u2019t understand why I won\u2019t just apologize to her if I obviously like her as much as I do. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t explain it to him, so he\u2019ll never understand it. But he seems okay with that.</p><p>Neither of us thinks it\u2019s a good idea to let Sky know we hung out. I don\u2019t want her upset with Breckin, but now it feels like I\u2019m somehow cheating on her by being friends with him. But I can assure you, Les. I wasn\u2019t there for his gay parts.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-one</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what we do,\u201d Daniel says.</p><p>\u201cMe neither.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re sitting in his driveway. I\u2019m leaned back in my seat with my foot propped on his dash. He\u2019s in the same position in the driver\u2019s seat, only his hand is hanging loosely from the steering wheel and his head is resting against the headrest. He\u2019s staring out the window and he\u2019s being unusually distant.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He continues to stare out the window and sighs a heavy, depressing sigh. \u201cBroke up with Val again,\u201d he says disappointedly. \u201cShe\u2019s crazy. She\u2019s so fucking crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought that\u2019s why you loved her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s also why I don\u2019t.\u201d He drops his leg to the floorboard and scoots his seat forward. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d He cranks the car and begins backing out of the driveway.</p> <p>I put my seatbelt on and slide my sunglasses off my head and over my eyes. \u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what we do,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cMe neither.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Breckin home?\u201d I ask his mother, who\u2019s now eyeing Daniel from the doorway in the same way she was eyeing me last Friday night.</p><p>\u201cWell, aren\u2019t you becoming a real regular,\u201d Breckin\u2019s mother says to me. There isn\u2019t any humor behind her voice and quite frankly, she\u2019s a little intimidating.</p><p>We stand silently for several awkward seconds and she still doesn\u2019t invite us in. Daniel leans his head toward mine. \u201cHold me. I\u2019m scared.\u201d</p><p>The door widens and Breckin replaces his mother after she turns and walks away. He\u2019s now the one eyeing Daniel suspiciously. \u201cI\u2019m definitely not doing you any favors,\u201d Breckin says to him.</p><p>Daniel turns to face me, shooting me a quizzical look. \u201cIt\u2019s Friday night and you bring me to powder puff\u2019s house?\u201d He shakes his head disappointedly. \u201cWhat the hell has happened to us, man? What the hell have these bitches done to us?\u201d</p><p>I look at Breckin and nudge my head sympathetically in Daniel\u2019s direction. \u201cGirl trouble. I thought some Modern Warfare could help.\u201d</p><p>Breckin sighs, rolls his eyes, then steps aside to let us in. We make our way inside and Breckin closes the door behind us, then stops in front of Daniel. \u201cYou call me powder puff again and my new second-best friend ever in the whole wide world will kick your ass.\u201d</p><p>Daniel grins, then cuts his eyes to mine. We have one of our silent conversations where he tells me this kid isn\u2019t half bad. I smile, completely agreeing with him.</p><p>\u201cLet me get this straight,\u201d Breckin says, trying to clarify the confession Daniel just made. \u201cYou don\u2019t even know what the girl looked like?\u201d</p><p>Daniel smiles boastfully. \u201cNo clue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was her name?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cNo clue.\u201d</p><p>Breckin sets down his game controller and turns to face Daniel. \u201cHow the hell did you end up in the maintenance closet with her?\u201d</p><p>Daniel\u2019s face is still awash with a smug grin. He seems so proud of it, I\u2019m shocked this is the first time he\u2019s mentioned it to me.</p><p>\u201cFunny story, really,\u201d he says. \u201cLast year I was never assigned a fifth-period class. It was a mistake on administration\u2019s part, but I didn\u2019t want them to know. Every day during fifth period while everyone else went to their scheduled classes, I would hide out in the janitor\u2019s closet and nap. They never cleaned that section of the hallway until after school, so no one ever went in there.</p><p>\u201cI guess it was about six or seven months ago, right before the end of the school year, I was having one of my fifth-period naps and all of a sudden someone opens the door, slips inside, and trips over me. I couldn\u2019t see who she was because I always kept the lights out, but she landed right on top of me. We were in this really compromising position and she smelled really good and she didn\u2019t weigh very much, so I didn\u2019t mind her landing on me. I wrapped my arms around her and made no attempt to roll her off me because she felt so damn good. She was crying, though,\u201d he says, losing some of the excitement in his eyes. He leans back in his chair and continues. \u201cI asked her what was wrong and all she said was, \u2018I hate them.\u2019 I asked her who she hated and she said, \u2018Everybody. I hate everybody.\u2019 The way she said it was just heartbreaking and I felt bad for her and her breath smelled so fucking good and I knew exactly what she meant because I hate everyone, too. So I kept my arms wrapped around her and I said, \u2018I hate everybody, too, Cinderella.\u2019 We were still in . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, wait, wait,\u201d Breckin says, interrupting the story. \u201cYou called her Cinderella? What the hell for?\u201d</p><p>Daniel shrugs. \u201cWe were in a janitor\u2019s closet. I didn\u2019t know her name and there were all these mops and brooms and shit and it reminded me of Cinderella, okay? Give me a break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why would you even call her anything?\u201d Breckin asks, not understanding Daniel\u2019s penchant for random nicknames.</p><p>Daniel rolls his eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t know her fucking name, Einstein! Now stop interrupting me, I\u2019m just now getting to the good part.\u201d He leans forward again. \u201cSo I said to her, \u2018I hate everybody, too, Cinderella.\u2019 We were still in the same position and it was dark and to be honest, it was really kinda hot. You know, not knowing who she was or what she looked like. Sort of mysterious. Then she just laughs and leans forward and kisses me. Of course I kissed her back because I\u2019d already finished my nap and we still had about fifteen minutes to kill. We kissed for the rest of the period. That\u2019s all we did. We never spoke another word and we never did more than just kiss. When the bell rang, she hopped up and walked out. I didn\u2019t even see what she looked like.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s staring at the floor, smiling. I\u2019ve honestly never seen him talk about a girl like this before. Not even Val.</p><p>\u201cBut I thought you said she was the best sex you ever had?\u201d Breckin says, bringing us back to the point that started this whole conversation.</p><p>Daniel grins boastfully again. \u201cShe was. Turns out I wasn\u2019t hard to find after that. She showed up again a week later. The closet light was out like always and she walked in and shut the door behind her. She was crying again. She said, \u2018Are you in here, kid?\u2019 The way she called me kid made me think she might have been a teacher and I\u2019d be lying if I said that didn\u2019t turn me on. Then one thing led to another and let\u2019s just say I became her Prince Charming for the rest of the hour. And that was the best sex I ever had.\u201d</p><p>Breckin and I both laugh.</p><p>\u201cSo who was she?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Daniel shrugs. \u201cI never found out. She never showed up again after that and school ended a few weeks later. Then I met Val and my life spiraled out of control.\u201d He exhales a deep rush of air, then turns to face Breckin. \u201cIs it racist of me to not really want to hear about your gay sex?\u201d</p><p>Breckin laughs and throws his game controller at Daniel. \u201cRacist isn\u2019t the correct term, dipshit. Homophobic and discriminatory, yes. And understandable. I wouldn\u2019t tell you, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Daniel looks at me. \u201cI don\u2019t even have to guess who you\u2019ll say was your best,\u201d he says. \u201cThe way Sky has you broken right now, I think it\u2019s pretty obvious.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cWell, you\u2019re wrong, because not only did I never have sex with her, but we never even kissed.\u201d</p><p>Daniel laughs but Breckin doesn\u2019t and neither do I, which quickly shuts Daniel up. \u201cPlease tell me you\u2019re kidding.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shake my head.</p><p>Daniel stands up and tosses his controller onto the bed. \u201cHow the hell have you not kissed her?\u201d he says, raising his voice. \u201cBecause the way you\u2019ve been acting this month had me thinking she was the fucking love of your life.\u201d</p><p>I cock my head. \u201cWhy do you seem pissed off by this?\u201d</p><p>He rolls his head. \u201cSeriously?\u201d He stalks toward me and bends forward, placing his hands on either side of my chair. \u201cBecause you\u2019re being a pussy. P-U-S-S-Y.\u201d He lets go of my chair and backs up. \u201cJesus, Holder. I was actually feeling sorry for you. Suck it up, man. Go to her house and fucking kiss her already and allow yourself to be happy for once.\u201d</p> <p>He drops down onto the bed and grabs his controller. Breckin smiles a tight-lipped smile and shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t really like your friend, but he does make a good point. I still don\u2019t understand why you got so mad at her and walked away, but the only way to make it up to her is to not stay away.\u201d He turns back toward the TV and I\u2019m staring at both of them, completely speechless.</p><p>They make it sound so simple. They make it sound so easy, like her whole life isn\u2019t hanging in the balance. They don\u2019t know what the fuck they\u2019re talking about.</p><p>\u201cTake me home,\u201d I say to Daniel. I don\u2019t want to be here anymore. I walk out of Breckin\u2019s bedroom and make my way back to Daniel\u2019s car.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-two</p><p>Les,</p> <p>Everyone likes to have an opinion, don\u2019t they? Daniel and Breckin have no clue what I\u2019ve been through. What either of us has been through.</p><p>Fuck it. I don\u2019t even feel like telling you about it.</p><p>I close the notebook and stare at it. Why the hell do I even write in it? Why the hell do I bother when she\u2019s fucking dead? I throw the notebook across the room and it hits the wall and falls to the floor. I throw the pen at the notebook and then grab my pillow from behind my head and throw it, too.</p><p>\u201cDammit,\u201d I groan, frustrated. I\u2019m pissed that Daniel thinks my life is so simple. I\u2019m pissed that Breckin still thinks I should just apologize to her, like that would make it all okay. I\u2019m pissed that I\u2019m still writing to Les even though she\u2019s dead.. She can\u2019t read it. She\u2019ll never read it. I\u2019m just putting all the shit I\u2019m living through down on paper for no reason other than the fact that there isn\u2019t a single goddamned person in the world right now that I can talk to.</p><p>I lie down, then get pissed again and punch my bed because my damn pillow is all the way across the room. I stand up and walk to the pillow, snatching it up. I look down at the notebook beneath it, spread open on the floor.</p><p>The pillow falls out of my hand.</p> <p>My knees fall to the floor.</p><p>My hands clench the notebook that has flipped open to the very last page.</p><p>I frantically flip through the pages covered in Les\u2019s handwriting until I find where the words begin. As soon as I see the first words written on top of the page, my heart comes to a screeching halt.</p><p>Dear Holder,</p><p>If you\u2019re reading this, I\u2019m so, so sor</p><p>I slam the notebook shut and throw it across the room.</p><p>She wrote me a letter?</p><p>A fucking suicide letter?</p> <p>I can\u2019t breathe. Oh, God, I can\u2019t breathe. I pull myself up and jerk open my window, then stick my head out. I take a deep breath and it\u2019s not enough air. There isn\u2019t enough air and I can\u2019t breathe. I shut the window and run to my bedroom door. I swing it open and rush down the stairs, taking them several at a time. I pass by my mother and her eyes grow wide, seeing me in such a hurry.</p><p>\u201cHolder, it\u2019s midnight! Where are\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRunning!\u201d I yell, then slam the front door behind me.</p><p>And that\u2019s what I do. I run. I run straight to Sky\u2019s house because she\u2019s the only thing in the world that can help me breathe again.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-three</p><p>These past few weeks of doing everything in my power to avoid her have taken every ounce of my strength and I can\u2019t do it anymore. I thought by staying away from her I was being strong, but not being near her is making me weaker than I\u2019ve ever been. I know I shouldn\u2019t be here and I know she doesn\u2019t want me here but I have to see her. I have to hear her, I have to touch her, I have to feel her against me because that weekend I spent with her was the only time since I walked away from her thirteen years ago that I actually looked forward.</p><p>I\u2019ve never looked forward before. I\u2019ve always looked back. I think about the past way too much and I think about what I should have done and everything I did wrong and I\u2019ve never once looked forward in my life. Being with her had me thinking about tomorrow and the day after that and the day after that and next year and forever. I need that right now because if I don\u2019t get to hold her one more time . . . I\u2019m scared I\u2019ll look back again and the past will completely swallow me up.</p><p>I grab the windowsill and close my eyes. I inhale several times in an attempt to calm my pulse and the trembling going on with my hands right now.</p><p>I hate that she always leaves her window unlocked. I push it up and slide the curtains back, then climb inside. I contemplate saying something so she\u2019ll know I\u2019m in her room, but I also don\u2019t want to scare her if she\u2019s asleep.</p><p>I turn and close the window and walk to her bed, then slowly ease myself down. She\u2019s facing the other way, so I lift the covers and scoot in beside her. Her posture immediately stiffens and she pulls her hands up to her face. I know she\u2019s awake and I know she knows it\u2019s me climbing into her bed, but the fact that it terrifies her completely breaks me.</p><p>She\u2019s scared of me. I didn\u2019t expect fear to be a reaction from her at all. Anger, yes. I\u2019d so much rather her be angry at me right now than scared.</p><p>She\u2019s not telling me to leave yet and I don\u2019t think I could even if she asked me to. I have to feel her in my arms, so I move closer to her and slide my arm under her pillow. I wrap my other arm around her and slide my fingers into hers, then bury my face into her neck. Her scent and her skin and the feel of her heartbeat against our hands is exactly what I need, more tonight than ever before I just need to know that I\u2019m not alone, even if she doesn\u2019t have a clue how much allowing me to hold her is helping.</p><p>I kiss her softly on the side of her head and pull her closer. I don\u2019t deserve to be back in her bed or in her life after all I\u2019ve put her through. In this moment, she\u2019s allowing me to be here. I\u2019m not going to think about what might happen in the next few minutes. I\u2019m not going to think about what happened in the past. I\u2019m not looking forward or backward. I\u2019m just holding her and thinking about this. Right now. Her.</p><p>She hasn\u2019t spoken in almost half an hour, but neither have I. I\u2019m not apologizing to her, because I don\u2019t deserve her forgiveness and that\u2019s not why I\u2019m here. I can\u2019t tell her what happened that day at lunch because I don\u2019t want her to know yet. I have no idea what to say, so I just hold her. I kiss her hair and I silently thank her for helping me breathe again.</p><p>I fold my arm up and hold her tighter. I\u2019m trying not to fall apart right now. I\u2019m trying so hard. She inhales a breath, then speaks to me for the first time in almost a month. \u201cI\u2019m so mad at you,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>I squeeze my eyes shut and press my lips desperately against her skin. \u201cI know, Sky.\u201d I slip my hand around her to pull her closer. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers slide through mine and she squeezes my hand. All she did was squeeze my hand, but that one small gesture does more for me in this moment than I could ever give her in return. Knowing she\u2019s reassuring me, even in the slightest way, is more than I deserve from her.</p><p>I press my lips to her shoulder and kiss her softly. \u201cI know,\u201d I whisper again as I continue kissing up her neck. She\u2019s responding to my touch and to my kiss and I want to stay here forever. I wish I could freeze time. I want to freeze the past and the future and just focus on being here in this moment with her forever.</p><p>She reaches up and runs her hand to the back of my head, pulling me against her neck even harder. She wants me here. She needs me here just as much as I need to be here and just knowing that is enough to freeze time for just a little while.</p><p>I raise up in the bed next to her and gently pull on her shoulder until she\u2019s flat on her back, looking up at me. I brush the hair away from her eyes and look down at her. I\u2019ve missed her so much and I\u2019m so scared she\u2019ll come to her senses and ask me to leave. God, I\u2019ve missed her. How did I ever think walking away from her would be good for either of us?</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re mad at me,\u201d I say, running my hand down to her neck. \u201cI need you to be mad at me, Sky. But I think I need you to still want me here with you even more.\u201d</p><p>She continues to keep her eyes locked with mine and she nods her head slightly. I drop my forehead to hers and take her face in my hands, and she does the same to me.</p><p>\u201cI am mad at you, Holder,\u201d she says. \u201cBut no matter how mad I\u2019ve been, I never for one second stopped wanting you here with me.\u201d</p><p>Those words knock the breath out of me at the same time they completely fill my lungs back up with her air. She wants me here and it\u2019s the best fucking feeling in the world. \u201cJesus, Sky. I\u2019ve missed you so bad.\u201d I feel like she\u2019s my lifeline and if I don\u2019t kiss her immediately, I\u2019ll die.</p><p>I dip my head and press my mouth to hers. We both inhale a deep breath the second our lips meet. She wraps her arms around my neck and pulls me to her, welcoming me back into her life. Our mouths are pressed desperately together but our lips are completely still and we\u2019re both attempting to inhale another breath. I pull back slightly because the feel of her beneath me and having her mouth willingly pressed to mine is completely overwhelming me. In all my eighteen years, nothing has ever felt more perfect. As soon as my lips separate from hers, she looks up into my eyes and wraps her hands around my neck. She lifts up from the bed slightly, bringing her mouth back to mine. This time she kisses me, softly parting my lips with hers. When our tongues meet, she moans and I push her back against the mattress, kissing her this time.</p><p>For the next few minutes, we\u2019re completely lost in what feels like sheer perfection. Time has completely stopped, and all I\u2019m thinking about while we kiss is how this is what saves people. Moments like these with people like her are what make all the suffering worth it. It\u2019s moments like these that keep people looking forward and I can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve let them slip by for an entire month.</p><p>I know I told her that she\u2019s never really been kissed before, but until this moment I had no idea that I had never really been kissed before. Not like this. Every kiss, every movement, every moan, every touch of her hand against my skin. She\u2019s my saving grace. My Hope.</p><p>And I\u2019m never walking away from her again.</p><p>I hear the door to her bedroom close, so I know she\u2019s about to walk in on me cooking breakfast for her. I still haven\u2019t explained what the hell I\u2019ve done to her over the past month and I\u2019m not sure that I can, but I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to get her to accept it without letting her forgive me. No matter what happened between us last night, I still don\u2019t deserve her forgiveness and honestly, she\u2019s not the type of girl who would put up with the shit I\u2019ve put her through. If she forgave me, I feel like she would be compromising her strength. I don\u2019t want her compromising anything about herself for my sake. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I know she\u2019s standing behind me. Before everything I\u2019ve done catches back up with her again, I try to explain away the fact that I\u2019ve made myself at home in her kitchen again.</p><p>\u201cI left early this morning,\u201d I say with my back still turned to her, \u201cbecause I was afraid your mom would walk in and think I was trying to get you pregnant. Then when I went for my run, I passed by your house again and realized her car wasn\u2019t even home and remembered you said she does those trade days every month. So I decided to pick up some groceries because I wanted to cook you breakfast. I also almost bought groceries for lunch and dinner, but maybe we should take it one meal at a time today.\u201d</p><p>I turn around to face her and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because I\u2019ve spent the last few weeks having to be so far away from her or what, but she\u2019s the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever laid eyes on. I look her up and down, recognizing that this is the first time I\u2019ve ever fallen in love with a piece of clothing before. What the hell is she trying to do to me?</p><p>\u201cHappy birthday,\u201d I say casually, trying not to show her just how flustered I am looking at her in that outfit. \u201cI really like that dress. I bought real milk, you want some?\u201d I take a glass and pour her some milk, then slide it to her. She eyes the milk warily but I don\u2019t give her time to drink it. Seeing those lips and that mouth and . . . shit.</p> <p>\u201cI need to kiss you,\u201d I say, walking swiftly to her. I take her face in my hands. \u201cYour mouth was so damn perfect last night, I\u2019m scared I dreamt that whole thing.\u201d I expect her to resist, but she doesn\u2019t. Instead, I\u2019m met with eager perfection when she grabs me by the shirt with both hands and kisses me back. Knowing that she still wants me after all I\u2019ve put her through makes me appreciate her even more. And knowing I still have a chance with her?</p><p>That I\u2019ll still get to kiss her like this?</p><p>It\u2019s almost too much.</p><p>I separate from her and back away, smiling. \u201cNope. Didn\u2019t dream it.\u201d</p><p>I face the stove again so that I can stop concentrating on her mouth long enough to make her a plate of food. I have so much I need to say to her and I don\u2019t even know where or how to start. I fix our plates and walk them to the bar where she\u2019s seated.</p> <p>\u201cAre we allowed to play Dinner Quest, even though it\u2019s breakfast time?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>She nods. \u201cIf I get the first question.\u201d</p><p>She isn\u2019t smiling. She hasn\u2019t smiled for me in over a month. I hate that I\u2019m the reason she doesn\u2019t smile anymore.</p><p>I lay my fork down on my plate and bring my hands up, clasping them under my chin. \u201cI was thinking about just letting you have all the questions,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI only need the answer to one,\u201d she says.</p><p>I sigh, knowing for a fact she needs more than just one answer. But the fact that she only wants the answer to one question leads me to believe she\u2019s about to ask me about the bracelet. And that\u2019s the one question I\u2019m not willing to share the answer to just yet.</p> <p>She leans forward in her chair and I brace myself for her question.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been using drugs, Holder?\u201d</p><p>I immediately look up at her, not expecting that to have been her question at all. It comes from so far out of left field that I keep my eyes locked with hers, but the randomness of the question makes me want to laugh. Maybe I should be disturbed by the fact that my behavior has given her such an absurd thought, but instead I feel nothing but relief.</p><p>I\u2019m trying. I\u2019m trying so hard not to laugh, but the anger in her eyes is adorable. It\u2019s adorable and beautiful and honest and I\u2019m so relieved. I have to look away from her because I\u2019m trying my damndest not to smile. She\u2019s being so serious and straightforward right now, but dammit. I can\u2019t.</p><p>My smile finally gives way and I laugh. Her eyes grow angrier, which only makes me laugh harder. \u201cDrugs?\u201d I\u2019m trying to stop, but the more I think about how much this has affected us the entire last month, it just makes me laugh even harder. \u201cYou think I\u2019m on drugs?\u201d</p><p>Her expression doesn\u2019t change at all. She\u2019s pissed. I hold my breath in an attempt to stop the laughter until I\u2019m able to keep a straight face. I lean forward and take her hand in mine, looking her directly in the eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not on drugs, Sky. I promise. I don\u2019t know why you would think that, but I swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what the hell is wrong with you?\u201d she snaps.</p><p>Shit. I hate the look on her face. She\u2019s hurt. Disappointed. Exhausted. I\u2019m not sure which part of my unexplained, erratic behavior she\u2019s referring to, but I honestly have no idea how to answer that. What is wrong with me? What\u2019s not wrong with me?</p> <p>\u201cCan you be a little less vague?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cSure. What happened to us and why are you acting like it never happened?\u201d</p><p>Damn. That hurts. She thinks I just brushed everything that happened between us under the rug? I want to tell her everything. I want to tell her how much she means to me and how this has been one of the hardest months of my life. I want to tell her about Les and her and me, and how much it fucking hurts that she doesn\u2019t remember. How can she just forget such a significant part of her life?</p><p>Maybe Les and I weren\u2019t as significant to her as I thought. I look down at my arm. I trace the H and the O and the P and the E, wishing she remembered. But then again, if she remembered . . . she\u2019d also know the meaning behind this tattoo. She\u2019d know that I let her down. She\u2019d remember that everything that\u2019s happened in her life for the last thirteen years is a direct result of me.</p><p>I look her in the eyes and answer her with the most honest answer I\u2019ll allow myself to give her. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to let you down, Sky. I\u2019ve let everyone down in my life that\u2019s ever loved me, and after that day at lunch I knew I let you down, too. So . . . I left you before you could start loving me. Otherwise, any effort to try not to disappoint you would be hopeless.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes cloud with disappointment. I know I\u2019m being vague again, but I can\u2019t tell her. Not right now. Not until I know for sure that she\u2019ll be okay.</p><p>\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you just say it, Holder? Why couldn\u2019t you just apologize?\u201d</p><p>The hurt in her voice grips my heart. I look her directly in the eyes so she\u2019ll see how important it is to me that she never accepts how I treated her. \u201cI\u2019m not apologizing to you . . . because I don\u2019t want you to forgive me.\u201d</p><p>She immediately squeezes her eyes shut, trying to hold back tears. Nothing I can say could make her feel better about what happened between us. I release her hand and stand up, then walk to her and pick her up. I set her down on top of the bar so that we\u2019re at eye level. She may not believe the words that come out of my mouth, but I need her to feel me. I need her to see the sincerity in my eyes and the honesty in my voice so she\u2019ll know I didn\u2019t mean to hurt her. I only wanted to protect her from feeling this way, but I\u2019ve only made it worse.</p><p>\u201cBabe, I screwed up. I\u2019ve screwed up more than once with you, I know that. But believe me, what happened at lunch that day wasn\u2019t jealousy or anger or anything that should ever scare you. I wish I could tell you what happened, but I can\u2019t. Someday I will, but I can\u2019t right now and I need you to accept that. Please. And I\u2019m not apologizing to you, because I don\u2019t want you to forget what happened and you should never forgive me for it. Ever. Never make excuses for me, Sky.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s taking in every word I\u2019m saying and I love that about her. I lean in and kiss her, then pull back and continue saying what I need to say while she\u2019s still willing to hear me out.</p><p>\u201cI told myself to just stay away from you and let you be mad at me, because I do have so many issues that I\u2019m not ready to share with you yet. And I tried so hard to stay away, but I can\u2019t. I\u2019m not strong enough to keep denying whatever this is we could have. And yesterday in the lunchroom when you were hugging Breckin and laughing with him? It felt so good to see you happy, Sky. But I wanted so bad to be the one who was making you laugh like that. It was tearing me up inside that you were thinking that I didn\u2019t care about us, or that spending that weekend with you wasn\u2019t the best weekend I\u2019ve ever had in my life. Because I do care and it was the best. It was the best fucking weekend in the history of all weekends.\u201d</p><p>I run my hands down her hair to the base of her neck and brush her jawline with my thumbs. I have to take in a calming breath to say what I want to say next, because I don\u2019t want to scare her. I just need to be honest with her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s killing me, Sky,\u201d I say quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s killing me because I don\u2019t want you to go another day without knowing how I feel about you. And I\u2019m not ready to tell you I\u2019m in love with you, because I\u2019m not. Not yet. But whatever this is I\u2019m feeling\u2014it\u2019s so much more than just like. It\u2019s so much more. And for the past few weeks I\u2019ve been trying to figure it out. I\u2019ve been trying to figure out why there isn\u2019t some other word to describe it. I want to tell you exactly how I feel but there isn\u2019t a single goddamned word in the entire dictionary that can describe this point between liking you and loving you, but I need that word. I need it because I need you to hear me say it.\u201d</p><p>I kiss her and pull back, but she\u2019s still looking at me in disbelief. I kiss her again and again, pausing after each kiss, hoping she\u2019ll respond with something. I don\u2019t care if she slaps me or kisses me back or tells me she loves me. I just want her to acknowledge everything I said. Instead, she\u2019s just staring at me and it\u2019s making me so damn nervous.</p><p>\u201cSay something,\u201d I plead.</p><p>She continues to stare at me for a long time. I try to stay patient. She\u2019s always patient with me even though she\u2019s so quick-witted. What I wouldn\u2019t give for her to be a little more quick-witted in this moment. I need a reaction from her.</p><p>Something. Anything.</p><p>\u201cLiving,\u201d she finally whispers.</p><p>That\u2019s not what I expected to come out of her mouth, but at least it\u2019s something. I laugh and shake my head, confused about what she means. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLive. If you mix the letters up in the words like and love, you get live. You can use that word.\u201d</p><p>Not only does she get me and not only is she smiling at me; but she just somehow gave me the one word I\u2019ve been searching for since the moment I laid eyes on her in the grocery store.</p><p>I don\u2019t deserve her. I don\u2019t deserve her understanding and I sure as hell don\u2019t deserve the way she just made my heart feel. I laugh and take her in my arms, bringing my mouth to hers. \u201cI live you, Sky,\u201d I say against her lips. \u201cI live you so much.\u201d</p><p>And as perfect as that word sounds, as perfectly as it describes the point we\u2019re at, I know it\u2019s a lie.</p><p>I don\u2019t just live her. I love her. I\u2019ve loved her since we were kids.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-four</p><p>Les,</p><p>I\u2019m not reading that letter. I\u2019m never reading it. Ever. And I\u2019m done writing in this fucking notebook. So I guess that means I\u2019m done writing to you, too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Thirty-five</p><p>The phone rings and before I can even say hello, Daniel starts talking. \u201cDo you and cheese tits want to come over and watch a movie with me and Val tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you broke up with Val.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot today,\u201d Daniel says.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d I\u2019ve heard enough about Val to know that I\u2019m not sure I feel comfortable taking Sky over there. We\u2019ve only been dating two weeks.</p><p>\u201cIt is a good idea,\u201d Daniel argues. \u201cMy parents leave at eight. Be here at eight-oh-one.\u201d</p><p>He hangs up abruptly, so I text Sky.</p><p>Want to watch a movie with Daniel and Val tonight?</p><p>I hit send and toss my phone on the bed. I walk to my closet to inspect my shirt selection, but then I remember that I don\u2019t really have much of a shirt selection. I grab a random T-shirt and am pulling it on over my head when Sky\u2019s text sounds off.</p> <p>Two conditions. (Per Karen.) I have to be home by midnight and you can\u2019t get me pregnant.</p><p>I laugh and text her back.</p><p>Considering how boring you are, I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019ll be home in less than an hour.</p><p>Does that mean you\u2019re still gonna try to get me pregnant, though?</p><p>Damn straight.</p><p>Laugh out loud.</p> <p>She actually typed laugh out loud.</p><p>I really do lol, then I put my phone in my pocket and head to my car.</p><p>I\u2019ve never really had a conversation with Val before and tonight is no exception. Sky and I are on the couch in front of the TV in Daniel\u2019s basement. Daniel and Val are in the chair and they\u2019re completely mauling each other, making me question why Daniel would even want us here in the first place if this is all they\u2019re gonna do.</p><p>Sky and I are watching them uncomfortably. It\u2019s hard to pay attention to the TV when there\u2019s actual slurping occurring.</p><p>The second Daniel\u2019s hand begins to slip up Val\u2019s shirt, I toss the remote at them, hitting Daniel in the knee. He jumps and lifts his hand to flip me off, but never breaks contact with Val\u2019s mouth. He does somehow glance at me, though, and I silently tell him to get the hell out of his basement, or get the hell out of her shirt.</p><p>He stands up and Val is now wrapped around him. They say nothing as he carries her up the stairs and to his bedroom.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Sky says, breathing a sigh of relief. \u201cI was about to hurl.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s curled up beside me on the couch with her head resting on my shoulder. I ease myself down into the couch so that we\u2019re more comfortable, and we both look back at the TV. But I know we aren\u2019t really paying attention to it because the energy in the room completely shifted the second Daniel and Val left. We haven\u2019t had privacy like this since we officially started dating two weeks ago.</p> <p>Her hand is in mine and they\u2019re clasped together, resting on her thigh. She\u2019s not wearing the dress that completely melted me the first time I saw her in it, but she is wearing a dress. And I love this dress just as much as the other dress.</p><p>I wish she were wearing jeans, though. I overheard Les talking with one of her friends once when we were sixteen. They were about to go on a double date and the friend was explaining to Les the rules of \u201cmake-out\u201d clothes. She said if Les just wanted to kiss the guy, she needed to wear jeans because the guy would be less likely to slip his hand where he shouldn\u2019t. Then she told Les if she planned to move past first base, that a skirt or a dress was the way to go. Easy access, she said. I remember waiting in the living room after hearing that conversation to see which outfit Les chose. She walked down the stairs in a skirt and I marched her right back up to her room and forced her to change into a pair of jeans.</p><p>I wish Sky were wearing jeans right now because my hands are starting to sweat and I know she can feel my pulse through the palm of my hand. Her dress makes me think she wants to take things a step further tonight and I absolutely can\u2019t get that out of my head. I sure as hell want to take the next step, but what if Sky doesn\u2019t know the rules to \u201cmake-out\u201d clothes? What if she\u2019s wearing this dress just for the hell of it? What if she\u2019s just wearing this dress because her washing machine broke and all her jeans were dirty? What if she\u2019s wearing this dress because she didn\u2019t have time to change into jeans before I showed up at her house? What if she\u2019s wearing this dress because she went to some sort of random church today that has service on Saturdays?</p><p>I wish I knew what was going through her head right now. I rest my head against the back of the couch and swallow the huge lump in my throat before I speak. \u201cI like your dress,\u201d I say. It comes out in more of a raspy whisper because my throat is so weak right now just thinking about her. But I think she liked the way I said it, because she tilts her head and looks up at me, then slowly drops her eyes to my mouth. Thanks to the angle we\u2019re sitting, we wouldn\u2019t even have to shift positions to kiss. Her mouth is so incredibly close, it\u2019s practically on top of mine. But neither of us is taking advantage of that. Yet.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispers. The sweet breath from her words crashes against my mouth, warming me from the inside out.</p><p>The tension is so thick now, I can\u2019t even inhale.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d I whisper back, staring at her mouth the same way she\u2019s staring at mine. We\u2019re both quiet for a moment, just silently staring. She slides her lips together and moistens them and I\u2019m pretty sure I mutter \u201choly shit\u201d under my breath.</p><p>She likes that she just got me all flustered because she grins. \u201cWanna make out?\u201d she whispers.</p><p>Oh, hell yes.</p><p>My lips are on hers before the sentence is even completely out of her mouth. I lower my hands to her waist and pull her until she\u2019s straddling me.</p><p>Straddling me in. Her. Dress.</p><p>I keep my hands locked tight on her hips while her hands slowly make their way up my neck and into my hair. The way her chest is pressed against mine makes my head spin, and it feels like the only thing that could set it straight again is if I pull her even closer and kiss her even harder. So that\u2019s what I do. I slide my hands away from her hips and reach behind her and pull her closer, pressing her into me so perfectly that she moans and tugs on my hair. I keep one hand on her ass, letting it flow with the rhythm of her movements while my other hand slides up her back and into her hair. I pull her mouth deeper into mine while I straighten my posture and lean forward so that my back is no longer touching the couch and my mouth is as meshed with hers as it\u2019s gonna get. Only that just makes my head spin even worse, so we\u2019re kissing faster now and she\u2019s moaning louder and I\u2019m gripping her hips again and moving her against me so perfectly that I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s about to have a repeat of what I did to her the first night we made out.</p><p>I don\u2019t want that yet because she\u2019s wearing this dress and it\u2019s absolutely amazing and I\u2019m not even taking advantage of it. I grip her shoulders and push her away from me, letting myself fall back against the couch.</p><p>We\u2019re both gasping for breath. We\u2019re both smiling. We\u2019re both looking at each other like this is the best night ever because it\u2019s only ten o\u2019clock and we\u2019ve got a good two hours left of this. I release her shoulders and take her face in my hands, then slowly pull her back to my mouth. I change the position of my hands to support her weight and I stand up, then lower her onto the couch. I join her, pressing one knee between her legs and the other on the couch beside her.</p><p>I\u2019m starting to get the impression that Daniel picked out this oversized couch in the same way that girls pick out their make-out clothes. Because it\u2019s the perfect couch for this sort of thing.</p><p>I begin to kiss down her chin, down her neck and down to the area where her dress stops and her cleavage begins. I slowly glide my hand over her dress and up the length of her body until I reach her breast. I stroke my hand over the material and she hardens beneath my fingertips.</p><p>Ohmygod I fucking love tonight.</p><p>I groan and grab her breast a little harder and she moans, arching her back, pressing more of herself against my hand. I claim her mouth with mine and continue kissing her until we have to break for air again. I press my cheek against hers.</p><p>My lips are right next to her ear.</p><p>\u201cSky?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>She inhales a quick breath. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>I inhale a slow one. \u201cI live you.\u201d</p><p>She exhales. \u201cI live you, Dean Holder.\u201d</p><p>I exhale.</p><p>And inhale.</p><p>And exhale.</p><p>I repeat that sentence silently in my head. I live you, Dean Holder.</p><p>It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve heard her say Dean.</p><p>It\u2019s also the first time I\u2019ve ever had my heart impaled by a word before.</p><p>I lift away from her cheek and look down at her. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>She smiles. \u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>For being alive, I think to myself.</p><p>\u201cFor being you,\u201d I say out loud.</p><p>Her smile fades and I swear she looks right through my eyes and straight into my soul. \u201cI\u2019m good at being me,\u201d she says. \u201cEspecially when I\u2019m with you.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her for several seconds, then I have to lower my cheek to hers again. I want to kiss her, but I keep my cheek pressed firmly against hers because I don\u2019t want her to see the tears in my eyes.</p><p>I don\u2019t want her to see how much it hurts to know she can be this close to me . . . and somehow not remember me.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-five-and-a-half</p><p>Dear all dead people who aren\u2019t Les, since I\u2019m not writing letters to Les anymore,</p><p>I\u2019ve loved Hope since we were kids.</p><p>But tonight?</p><p>Tonight I fell in love with Sky.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-six</p><p>Les,</p><p>I know I said I wasn\u2019t writing to you anymore. Shut up. I\u2019m still not writing in that notebook because I don\u2019t want to touch it, knowing that letter from you is in there. I can\u2019t read it, so I just bought a new notebook. Problem solved. Now I need to catch you up.</p><p>I\u2019ve been dating Sky for a month now. She still hasn\u2019t had any recollection of me or you or all of us as kids. I keep catching myself almost slipping up, but luckily I haven\u2019t.</p><p>Remember that guy I got arrested for beating up last year? The one who was talking shit about you? Well, his brother finally said something to me today. I\u2019ve been waiting for him . . . or anyone, really . . . to bring it up since the day I got back to school. It would have been fine had he just confronted me, but he didn\u2019t. He had to use Sky and Breckin and even you as a way to get back at me. He started talking shit about them to me at lunch and I swear to God, Les. I wanted to hurt him just as badly as I hurt his brother. Actually, I probably would have hurt him worse than I hurt his brother had Sky not been there.</p><p>She saw where my mind was going and she immediately pulled me out of the situation, forcing me out of the lunchroom. When we made it to my car in the parking lot I just completely broke down on her. It was like the entire past year of my life was repeatedly punching me in the gut and I just had to get it out. I told Sky everything I was feeling and for the first time since it happened . . . I admitted to myself and out loud that I was the one in the wrong. And I also admitted for the first time that you were in the wrong. I told Sky how pissed I was at you. How angry I\u2019ve been since the second I walked in and found you lifeless in your bed. I\u2019ve been so mad at you, Les, for so many things. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But the thing that pissed me off the most was the fact that you never once thought about what it would do to me when I found you.

I was so mad because you let me die, too.</p><p>Sky\u2019s right. I\u2019ve got to let go of the blame. But until Sky knows the truth, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to forgive myself.

So until Sky knows the truth about her past, I don\u2019t want to risk her finding out from anyone other than me.</p><p>I don\u2019t want Sky to think I don\u2019t want her to be a part of my life by never allowing her to come to my house or meet my family, so I\u2019ve taken the opportunity to bring her here tonight since I know my mother won\u2019t be home. And even though we\u2019re finally alone, kissing on my bed, I don\u2019t feel right about it. The night didn\u2019t start out well and the guilt from everything that has happened up to this point is in the forefront of my mind, even though I\u2019d rather my mind be focused on the moment.</p><p>She\u2019s been distant all day and I should have known it was my fault somehow. After we left the art gallery where we went to support Breckin and his boyfriend, Max, she hardly spoke two words to me. I wondered if it had something to do with last night and sure enough, it had everything to do with last night.</p><p>After my mother\u2019s Halloween party at the law firm yesterday, where I may or may not have snuck too many drinks, I went to Sky\u2019s house and crawled through her window. Things were good and we fell asleep, only to wake up to her crying hysterically. She was crying and shaking and I\u2019ve never seen anyone react to a nightmare like that.</p><p>Ever.</p> <p>It scared the shit out of me. Mostly because I didn\u2019t know how to help her, but also because I really didn\u2019t know where the hell I was when I woke up next to her. I was still a little buzzed from the drinks and I had little recollection of even leaving my house and sneaking into her bedroom. It scared me to know that I was around her while I was incoherent. I was scared that I might have let something slip about her past. I held her until she stopped crying but then I left because I could still feel the effects of the alcohol and I really didn\u2019t want to say something to screw all this up.</p><p>But apparently I did, because earlier when we were downstairs, she said something about Hope. She said her name and it completely stunned me. Knocked the breath out of me. And if I wasn\u2019t trying my damndest to act like I didn\u2019t know what she was talking about., it would have knocked me to my knees.</p><p>But I let her explain herself and it turns out my fears were dead-on about being around her while I wasn\u2019t completely coherent. Apparently I mumbled Hope\u2019s name instead of Sky\u2019s, and for the entire past day she\u2019s been making herself sick about it. She\u2019s been thinking Hope was someone else entirely and the thought of her thinking I would want or need or even entertain the thought of another girl just completely breaks my heart.</p><p>So right now, I\u2019m doing everything I can to show her that she\u2019s the only girl I think about.</p><p>Just her.</p><p>I\u2019m kissing her, propped up on my hands and knees, attempting to avoid making her feel like I brought her here for anything other than to just spend time with her.</p> <p>But she is wearing a dress again.</p><p>After those two hours in Daniel\u2019s basement I think we were both pretty impressed with how well my hands and her dress became acquainted. We were also pretty impressed with how well my hands and the clothing under her dress became acquainted.</p><p>But now, here she is, wearing a dress again. And we passed quite a few firsts on that couch two weeks ago. So much so that it pretty much only leaves one more first to pass tonight and the fact that she knows that and I know that and she\u2019s still wearing a dress has my mind jumbled and my heart racing.</p><p>It also didn\u2019t help matters that before we made it up here to the bedroom, we were making out on the stairs and she blurted out the fact that she was a virgin. I already knew she was a virgin, but just the fact that she was thinking about it while I was kissing her to the point that she actually blurted it out loud leads me to believe that she just wanted to warn me for when we got to that point.</p><p>And I\u2019m thinking she\u2019s at that point, which is why she felt the need to clear the air downstairs, so she wouldn\u2019t have to say it when it actually came to that point.</p><p>To the point it\u2019s at right now.</p><p>The point at which I\u2019m thanking the angels and the gods and the birds and the bees and sweet baby Jesus that she\u2019s wearing this dress. If there\u2019s one thing that can ease my guilt and allow me to focus solely on her for the time being, it\u2019s this dress.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, Sky,\u201d I say, kissing her madly. \u201cGod, you feel incredible. Thank you for wearing this dress. I really . . .\u201d I kiss down her chin until my lips meet her neck. \u201cI really like it. Your dress.\u201d I continue kissing her neck and she tilts her head back, allowing me easier access. I drop my hand to her thigh and run it up under her dress. When I reach the top of her thigh I desperately want to keep going. But the fact that she\u2019s allowed me there once before doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m allowed there right now.</p> <p>But apparently I am, because she twists her body more toward mine, directing my hand to keep heading where it\u2019s heading. Her hands crawl up my back just as my hand greets the panties lining her hip. I slip my fingers underneath the lining and begin to tug at the same time she pulls on my shirt.</p><p>She begins to pull it over my head and I\u2019m forced to move my hand away. I squeeze her thigh, not wanting to have to pull back, but I\u2019m pretty sure I want my shirt off just as much as she wants it off.</p><p>As soon as I lift up onto my knees, away from her, she whimpers. The sound makes me smile and after my shirt is off, I bend forward and kiss the corner of her lips. I bring my hand to her face and gently stroke her hairline, watching her. I know we\u2019re about to pass the most significant first of all and I want to memorize everything about this moment. I want to remember exactly what she looks like lying beneath me. I want to remember exactly what she sounds like the moment I\u2019m inside her. I want to remember what she tastes like and what she feels like and what she\u2014</p><p>\u201cHolder,\u201d she says, breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cSky,\u201d I say, mimicking her. I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s about to say but whatever it is, it can wait a few seconds, because I need to kiss her again. I dip my head and part her lips until our tongues meet. We kiss slowly while I memorize every inch of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cHolder,\u201d she says again, pulling away from my mouth. She brings her hand to my cheek and looks up into my eyes. \u201cI want to. Tonight. Right now.\u201d</p><p>Right now. She said right now. That\u2019s nice because I conveniently don\u2019t have any prior engagements right now. I can do right now.</p><p>\u201cSky . . .\u201d I say, wanting to make sure she\u2019s not doing this just to benefit me. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to. I want you to be absolutely positive it\u2019s what you want. Okay? I don\u2019t want to rush you into anything.\u201d</p><p>She smiles and strokes her fingernails up and down my arms. \u201cI know that. But I\u2019m telling you I want this. I\u2019ve never wanted it with anyone before, but I want it with you.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s no doubt in my mind that I want her. I want her right now and she obviously wants me, too. But I can\u2019t help but feel guilty, knowing I\u2019m still deceiving her. I haven\u2019t told her the truth about us and I feel like if she knew, she wouldn\u2019t be making this decision.</p><p>I\u2019m about to pull away from her until she places her hand on my cheeks and lifts herself off the bed until her lips are touching mine. \u201cThis isn\u2019t me saying yes, Holder. This is me saying please.\u201d</p><p>What was it I was thinking just now? Something about waiting?</p><p>Fuck that.</p><p>Our lips collide and I groan, pushing her back against the bed. \u201cWe\u2019re really doing this?\u201d I ask, not really believing it myself.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She laughs. \u201cWe\u2019re really doing this. I\u2019ve never been more positive of anything in my life.\u201d</p><p>My hand resumes its position and I begin to pull down her panties.</p><p>\u201cI just need you to promise me one thing first,\u201d she says.</p><p>I pull my hand away, thinking maybe she\u2019s about to tell me to go a little slower. \u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>She takes my hand and places it right back on her hip. \u201cI want to do this,\u201d she says, firmly looking into my eyes. \u201cBut only if you promise we\u2019ll break the record for the best first time in the history of first times.\u201d</p><p>I smile. Damn straight. \u201cWhen it\u2019s you and me, Sky . . . it\u2019ll never be anything less.\u201d</p><p>I slide my arm underneath her back and pull her up. I curl my fingers underneath the straps of her dress, then slowly slide them down her arms. She fists one of her hands through my hair, pressing her cheek to mine while my lips meet her shoulder. My fingers are still holding on to the straps of her dress.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking it off.\u201d</p><p>She nods and I grab the loose material at her waist and begin to lift the dress over her head. Once it\u2019s completely off, I lower her back down onto the bed and she opens her eyes. I scroll over her body, running my hand down her arm and across her stomach, coming to rest on the curve of her hip. I let everything I\u2019m seeing sink in because this is what I want to remember the most. I want to remember exactly what she looks like the second she hands over a piece of her heart.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, Sky,\u201d I whisper, running my hands across her skin. I bend down and kiss her softly on the stomach. \u201cYou\u2019re incredible.\u201d</p><p>I watch my hand as it glides across her body. I watch as it slides up her stomach and meets her breast. I watch my thumb disappear beneath her bra. As soon as my entire hand has slipped beneath her bra, she\u2019s locking her legs around my waist. I groan and wish at this point that I had more hands because they want to be everywhere, all at once. And I don\u2019t want there to be any material in the way of their journey.</p><p>I reach down and pull her underwear off, then remove her bra. I\u2019m kissing her the whole time, even when I slide off the bed to remove the rest of my own clothes. I climb back onto the bed with her. Back on top of her.</p><p>As soon as I\u2019m pressed against her I\u2019m hit with the revelation that I\u2019ve never experienced or felt anything like her in my life. This is how it should be when people pass this first. This is exactly how it should feel and it\u2019s incredible.</p><p>I reach across the bed and pull a condom out of my nightstand. We haven\u2019t stopped kissing for a single second, but I need to see her face. I need to see that she wants me to be inside her as much as I want to be inside her.</p><p>I grab the condom and lift up onto my knees. I open it, but before I put it on I look down at her. Her eyes are closed tightly and her eyebrows are drawn together.</p><p>\u201cSky?\u201d I say. I want her to open her eyes. I just need one final look of reassurance from her, but she fails to open her eyes. I lower myself on top of her again, stroking her cheek. \u201cBabe,\u201d I whisper. \u201cOpen your eyes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her lips begin to tremble and she pulls her arms up, crossing them over her eyes. \u201cGet off me,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>My heart sinks, not knowing what I did wrong. I\u2019ve done everything I could to make this right but it\u2019s obviously gone wrong somewhere and I have no idea where. I sit up on my knees and scoot away from her just as a violent sob breaks from her. She twists away from me and hugs her arms, covering herself. \u201cPlease,\u201d she cries.</p><p>\u201cSky, I stopped,\u201d I say, stroking her arm. She pushes my hand away with her own and her whole body starts to shake. Her lips are moving and she\u2019s speaking under her breath, but I can\u2019t hear what she\u2019s saying. I lean forward to try and hear what she\u2019s trying to tell me.</p><p>\u201cTwenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty, thirty-one . . .\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019s counting in rapid succession and crying hysterically, curling herself into a ball on my mattress.</p><p>\u201cSky!\u201d I say louder, trying to get her to stop. I don\u2019t know what the hell is wrong or what I did but this isn\u2019t her and it\u2019s starting to freak me out. She\u2019s responding like I\u2019m not even here. I try to pull her arm away from her eyes so she\u2019ll look at me, but she starts slapping my hand away, crying hysterically.</p><p>\u201cDammit, Sky!\u201d I yell, frantic. I pull on her arm again but she\u2019s fighting it. I don\u2019t know what to do or why she won\u2019t snap out of this, so I scoop her up into my arms and pull her against my chest. She\u2019s still counting and crying and I think I might be on the verge of crying, too, because she\u2019s losing it and I have no idea how to help her. I rock her back and forth and brush the hair from her face, trying to get her to snap out of it, but she just continues to cry. I pull the sheet up and wrap it around us, then kiss her on the side of her head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I whisper, at a loss for what to do next.</p><p>Her eyes flick open and she looks up at me, her whole being consumed with fear. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sky,\u201d I say, still not knowing what went wrong or why she\u2019s terrified of me right now. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>I continue to rock her, still not understanding what\u2019s causing her reaction, but I\u2019ve never seen eyes so terrified before and I have no fucking clue how to calm her down.</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she cries, still looking at me with eyes full of fear.</p><p>She completely checked out and she doesn\u2019t even remember doing it?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I tell her, shaking my head. \u201cYou just started counting and crying and shaking and I kept trying to get you to stop, Sky. You wouldn\u2019t stop. You were terrified. What did I do? Tell me, because I\u2019m so sorry. I am so, so sorry. What the fuck did I do?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head, unable to answer me. It kills me that I don\u2019t know if I did something wrong to force her so far into her own head that she lost her grasp on reality.</p><p>I squeeze my eyes shut and press my forehead to hers. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I never should have let it go that far. I don\u2019t know what the hell just happened, but you\u2019re not ready yet, okay?\u201d</p><p>She nods, still holding on to me tightly. \u201cSo we didn\u2019t . . . we didn\u2019t have sex?\u201d she asks timidly.</p> <p>My heart sinks because I realize with those words that no matter what I try to do to protect her, there\u2019s something tearing her apart. She completely checked out like I\u2019ve never experienced before and there was nothing in my power I could do to stop it. I bring my hands to her cheeks. \u201cWhere\u2019d you go, Sky?\u201d</p><p>She looks at me confused and shakes her head. \u201cI\u2019m right here. I\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean earlier. Where\u2019d you go? You weren\u2019t here with me because no, nothing happened. I could see on your face that something was wrong, so I didn\u2019t do it. But now you need to think long and hard about where you were inside that head of yours, because you were panicked. You were hysterical and I need to know what it was that took you there so I can make sure you never go back.\u201d</p><p>I squeeze her tight, then kiss her on the forehead. I know she probably needs to regain her bearings right now, so I stand up and pull on my jeans and T-shirt, then help her back into her dress. \u201cI\u2019ll go get you some water. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d I lean forward, not sure if she even wants me near her right now, but I kiss her on the lips to reassure her.</p><p>I walk out of my room and head straight down to the kitchen. As soon as my elbows meet the countertop, I bury my face in my arms and muster up every ounce of willpower in me to stop myself from breaking down. I inhale several deep breaths, exhaling even bigger ones, hoping I can stay strong for her. But seeing her that helpless and knowing there was nothing I could do to help her?</p><p>It\u2019s the most disappointed in myself I\u2019ve ever been.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-eight</p><p>I\u2019m still leaning on the counter with my head in my hands when I hear a door close upstairs. I\u2019ve been down here for several minutes now and I don\u2019t want her to think I\u2019m trying to avoid her, so I head back upstairs. I check the bedroom and bathroom, but she\u2019s not in either. I look at Les\u2019s bedroom door and pause before reaching down and turning the knob.</p> <p>She\u2019s sitting on Les\u2019s bed, holding a picture. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I ask her. I don\u2019t know why she\u2019s in here. I don\u2019t want to be in here and I want her to come back to my room with me.</p><p>\u201cI was looking for the bathroom,\u201d she says quietly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I just needed a second.\u201d</p><p>I nod, since I apparently needed a second, too. I look around the room. I haven\u2019t set foot in here since the day I found the notebook. Her jeans are still in the middle of the floor, right where she left them.</p><p>\u201cHas no one been in here? Since she . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say, not wanting to hear her finish that sentence. \u201cWhat would be the point of it? She\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>She nods, then places the picture back down on the nightstand. \u201cWas she dating him?\u201d</p><p>Her question throws me for a second, then I realize she must have seen a picture of Les and Grayson together. I never told her they dated. I should have told her.</p><p>I step into the bedroom for the first time in over a year. I walk to the bed and take a seat next to her. I slowly scan the room, wondering why my mom and I thought it would be a better idea to just close the door after she died, rather than get rid of her things. I guess neither of us is ready to let her go just yet.</p><p>I glance at Sky and she\u2019s still looking at the picture frame on Les\u2019s nightstand. I wrap my arm around her shoulders and pull her to me. She brings a hand to my chest and clenches my shirt in her fist.</p><p>\u201cHe broke up with her the night before she did it,\u201d I say, giving her an explanation. I don\u2019t really want to talk about it, but the only other thing left to talk about is what just happened in my bed and I know Sky more than likely needs a little more time before we bring that up.</p><p>\u201cDo you think he\u2019s the reason why she did it? Is that why you hate him so much?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI hated him before he broke up with her. He put her through a lot of shit, Sky. And no, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s why she did it. I think maybe it was the deciding factor in a decision she had wanted to make for a long time. She had issues way before Grayson ever came into the picture. So no, I don\u2019t blame him. I never have.\u201d I grab her hand and stand up, because I honestly don\u2019t want to talk about it. I thought I could, but I can\u2019t. \u201cCome on. I don\u2019t want to be in here anymore.\u201d</p><p>I take her hand and she stands up, then we walk toward the door. She yanks her hand free once I reach the door, so I turn around. She\u2019s staring at a picture of me and Les when we were kids.</p><p>She\u2019s smiling at the picture, but my pulse immediately quickens when I realize that she\u2019s seeing me and Les as children. She\u2019s seeing us in the exact way she used to know us. I don\u2019t want her to remember. If she were to have even the slightest recollection right now, she might start asking questions. The last thing she needs after the breakdown she just had is to find out the truth.</p><p>She squeezes her eyes shut for a few seconds and the look on her face kicks my pulse up a notch. \u201cYou okay?\u201d I ask, attempting to pull the picture out of her hands. She immediately snatches it back and looks up at me.</p><p>It\u2019s the first sign of recognition I\u2019ve seen on her face and it feels like my entire body is wilting.</p><p>I manage to take a step toward her, but she immediately takes a step back. She keeps looking at the picture, then back up to me and I just want to grab the frame and throw it across the fucking room and pull her out of here, but I have a feeling it\u2019s too late.</p><p>Her hand goes up to her mouth and she chokes back a sob. She looks up at me like she wants to say something, but she can\u2019t speak.</p><p>\u201cSky, no,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d she says achingly, looking back down at the picture. \u201cThere\u2019s a swing set. And a well. And . . . your cat. It got stuck in the well. Holder, I know that living room. The living room is green and the kitchen had a countertop that was way too tall for us and . . . your mother. Your mother\u2019s name is Beth.\u201d Her rush of words come to a pause and she darts her eyes back up to mine. \u201cHolder?\u201d she says, sucking in a breath. \u201cIs Beth your mother\u2019s name?\u201d</p><p>Not tonight, not tonight. God, she doesn\u2019t need this tonight. \u201cSky . . .\u201d</p><p>She looks at me, heartbroken. She rushes past me and across the hall, into the bathroom, where she slams the door behind her. I follow after her and try to open the door but she\u2019s locked it.</p><p>\u201cSky, open the door. Please.\u201d</p><p>Nothing. She doesn\u2019t open the door and she says nothing.</p><p>\u201cBaby, please. We need to talk and I can\u2019t do it from out here. Please, open the door.\u201d</p><p>Another moment passes without her opening the door. I grip the edges of the doorframe and wait. It\u2019s too late to backtrack now. All I can do is wait until she\u2019s ready to hear the truth.</p><p>The door swings open and she\u2019s looking at me, her eyes full of anger now rather than fear.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Hope?\u201d she says, barely above a whisper.</p><p>How do I say it? How do I tell her the answer to that question, because as soon as I do I know I\u2019ll have to watch as her entire world collapses around her.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell is Hope?\u201d she says, much louder this time.</p><p>I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t tell her. She\u2019ll hate me and that would destroy me.</p><p>Her eyes fill with tears. \u201cIs it me?\u201d she asks, her voice barely audible. \u201cHolder . . . am I Hope?\u201d</p><p>A rush of breath escapes my lungs and I can feel the tears following. I look up to the ceiling to try to hold them back. I close my eyes and press my forehead against my arm, inhaling the breath that will encase the voice that will release the one word that will destroy her again.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes grow wide and she just stands there, slowly shaking her head. I can\u2019t even imagine what must be going through her head right now.</p><p>She suddenly shoves past me, out into the hallway. \u201cSky, wait,\u201d I yell as she descends the steps two at a time. I rush after her, trying to catch her before she leaves. As soon as she hits the bottom step, she collapses to the floor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSky!\u201d I drop to my knees and take her in my arms, but she\u2019s pushing against me.

But I know that\u2019s the last thing she wants right now. She knows I\u2019ve been lying to her and she has every right to hate me.</p><p>After a while, she finally turns and heads back inside. She brushes past me without making eye contact and she walks straight into the kitchen. She takes a bottle of water out of the fridge and opens it, downing several gulps before finally making eye contact with me.</p><p>\u201cTake me home.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ll get her out of the house, but I\u2019m not taking her home.</p> <p>We\u2019re at the airport now. I couldn\u2019t think of anywhere else quiet enough to take her and I refused to take her home until she asked me everything she needs to ask me. The only thing she asked me with any sincerity on the way here was why I got my tattoo. I told her the same thing I told her last time she asked me about it; only this time I think she actually understood.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready for answers?\u201d I ask her. We\u2019ve been silently watching the stars for several minutes now. I\u2019m just trying to give her a chance to calm down. To clear her head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready if you\u2019re actually planning on being honest this time,\u201d she says, anger lacing her voice.</p><p>I turn to face her and the hurt in her eyes is as prominent as the stars in the sky. I lift up onto my elbow and look down at her.</p><p>Just a while ago I was looking down at her this same way, memorizing everything about her. When we were in that moment on my bed I was looking at her with so much hope. I felt like she was mine and I was hers and that moment and feeling would last forever. But now, looking down at her . . . I feel like it\u2019s all about to end.</p><p>I lower my hand to her face and touch her. \u201cI need to kiss you.\u201d</p> <p>She shakes her head. \u201cNo,\u201d she says resolutely.</p><p>I feel like tonight is the end of us and if she doesn\u2019t let me kiss her one more time it\u2019ll kill me. \u201cI need to kiss you,\u201d I say again. \u201cPlease, Sky. I\u2019m scared that after I tell you what I\u2019m about to tell you . . . I\u2019ll never get to kiss you again.\u201d I grasp her face harder and pull her closer. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes are desperately searching mine, possibly to see if there\u2019s any shred of truth behind my words. She doesn\u2019t say anything. She just barely nods, but it\u2019s enough. I lower my head and press my lips firmly against hers. She grasps my forearm with her hand and parts her lips, allowing me to kiss her more intimately.</p><p>We continue to kiss for several minutes, because I don\u2019t know that either of us wants to face the truth just yet. I lift up onto my knees without breaking away from her and I climb on top of her. She runs her hand through my hair and to the back of my head, where she pulls against me, urging me closer.</p><p>She begins to clench my shirt with her fists as a cry breaks free from her throat. I move my lips to her cheek and kiss her softly, then lower my mouth to her ear. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I whisper, holding on to her with my free hand. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I didn\u2019t want you to know.\u201d</p><p>She pushes me off her, then sits up. She pulls her knees to her chest and buries her face in them.</p><p>\u201cI just want you to talk, Holder. I asked you everything I could ever ask you on the way here. I need you to answer me now so I can just go home,\u201d she says, sounding tired and exhausted. I stroke her hair and give her the answers she needs.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if you were Hope the first time I saw you. I was so used to seeing her in every single stranger our age, I had given up trying to find her a few years ago. But when I saw you at the store and looked into your eyes . . . I had a feeling you really were her. When you showed me your ID and I realized you weren\u2019t, I felt ridiculous. It was like the wake-up call I needed to finally just let the memory of her go.</p> <p>\u201cWe lived next door to you and your dad for a year. You and me and Les . . . we were all best friends. It\u2019s so hard to remember faces from that long ago, though. I thought you were Hope, but I also thought that if you really were her, I wouldn\u2019t be doubting it. I thought if I ever saw her again, I\u2019d know for sure.</p><p>\u201cWhen I left the grocery store that day, I immediately looked up the name you gave me online. I couldn\u2019t find anything about you, not even on Facebook. I searched for an hour straight and became so frustrated that I went for a run to cool down. When I rounded the corner and saw you standing in front of my house, I couldn\u2019t breathe. You were just standing there, worn out and exhausted from running and . . . Jesus, Sky. You were so beautiful. I still wasn\u2019t sure if you were Hope or not, but at that point it wasn\u2019t even going through my mind. I didn\u2019t care who you were; I just needed to know you.</p><p>\u201cAfter spending time with you that week, I couldn\u2019t stop myself from going to your house that Friday night. I didn\u2019t show up with the intention of digging up your past or even in the hope that something would happen between us. I went to your house because I wanted you to know the real me, not the me you had heard about from everyone else. After spending more time with you that night, I couldn\u2019t think of anything else besides figuring out how I could spend more time with you. I had never met anyone who got me the way you did. I still wondered if it was possible . . . if you were her. I was especially curious after you told me you were adopted, but again, I thought maybe it was a coincidence.</p><p>\u201cBut then when I saw the bracelet . . .\u201d</p><p>I need her to look me in the eyes for this, so I lift her chin and make her look at me.</p><p>\u201cMy heart broke, Sky. I didn\u2019t want you to be her. I wanted you to tell me you got the bracelet from your friend or that you found it or you bought it. After all the years I spent searching for you in every single face I ever looked at, I finally found you . . . and I was devastated.\u201d As soon as I say the word, I regret it. Because I know that isn\u2019t true. I was upset. I was overwhelmed. But I didn\u2019t even know the meaning of devastated. I sigh and finish my confession. \u201cI didn\u2019t want you to be Hope. I just wanted you to be you.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cBut why didn\u2019t you just tell me? How hard would it have been to admit that we used to know each other? I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019ve been lying about it.\u201d</p><p>God, this is so hard.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you remember about your adoption?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a lot,\u201d she says, shaking her head. \u201cI know I was in foster care after my father gave me up. I know Karen adopted me and we moved here from out of state when I was five. Other than that and a few odd memories, I don\u2019t know anything.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s not getting it. That\u2019s not what she remembers at all. It\u2019s what she\u2019s been told. I move from my position beside her and sit directly in front of her, facing her. I grab her by the shoulders. \u201cThat\u2019s all stuff Karen told you. I want to know what you remember. What do you remember, Sky?\u201d</p><p>She breaks eye contact with me, trying to think. When she comes up empty, she looks back up at me. \u201cNothing. The earliest memories I have are with Karen. The only thing I remember from before Karen was getting the bracelet, but that\u2019s only because I still have it and the memory stuck with me. I wasn\u2019t even sure who gave it to me.\u201d</p><p>I lower my lips to her forehead and kiss her, knowing the next words that come out of my mouth will be the words I know she doesn\u2019t want to hear. As if she can see how much this is hurting me, she wraps her arms around my neck and climbs onto my lap, holding me tightly. I wrap my arms around her, not quite understanding how she can even find it in herself to want to comfort me right now.</p><p>\u201cJust say it,\u201d she whispers. \u201cTell me what you\u2019re wishing you didn\u2019t have to tell me.\u201d</p><p>I lower my head to hers, squeezing my eyes shut. She thinks she wants to know the truth, but she doesn\u2019t. If she could feel what it\u2019s about to do to her, she wouldn\u2019t want to know.</p><p>\u201cJust tell me, Holder.\u201d</p><p>I sigh, then pull away from her. \u201cThe day Les gave you that bracelet, you were crying. I remember every single detail like it happened yesterday. You were sitting in your yard against your house. Les and I sat with you for a long time, but you never stopped crying. After she gave you your bracelet she walked back to our house but I couldn\u2019t. I felt bad leaving you there, because I thought you might be mad at your dad again. You were always crying because of him and it made me hate him. I don\u2019t remember anything about the guy, other than I hated his guts for making you feel like you did. I was just a kid, so I never knew what to say to you when you cried. I think that day I said something like, \u2018Don\u2019t worry . . .\u2019\u201d\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t live forever,\u201d she says, finishing my sentence. \u201cI remember that day. Les giving me the bracelet and you saying he won\u2019t live forever. Those are the two things I\u2019ve remembered all this time. I just didn\u2019t know it was you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I said to you.\u201d I take her face in my hands. \u201cAnd then I did something I\u2019ve regretted every single day of my life since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHolder,\u201d she says, shaking her head. \u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything. You just walked away.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cExactly. I walked to my front yard even though I knew I should have sat back down in the grass beside you. I stood in my front yard and I watched you cry into your arms, when you should have been crying into mine. I just stood there . . . and I watched the car pull up to the curb. I watched the passenger window roll down and I heard someone call your name. I watched you look up at the car and wipe your eyes. You stood up and you dusted off your shorts, then you walked to the car. I watched you climb inside and I knew whatever was happening I shouldn\u2019t have just been standing there. But all I did was watch, when I should have been with you. It never would have happened if I had stayed right there with you.\u201d</p><p>She takes a deep breath. \u201cWhat never would have happened?\u201d</p><p>I brush my thumbs over her cheekbones and look at her with as much calmness and reassurance as I can muster, because I know she\u2019s about to need it.</p><p>\u201cThey took you. Whoever was in that car, they took you from your dad, from me, from Les. You\u2019ve been missing for thirteen years, Hope.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty-nine, Chapter Thirty-nine-and-a-half, Chapter Thirty-nine-and-three-quarters</p><p>She closes her eyes and lays her head on my shoulder. She tightens her grip around me, so I tighten mine in return. I wait. I wait for it to sink in. I wait for the tears. I wait for the heartbreak because I know for a fact it\u2019s coming.</p><p>We sit in silence for several minutes, but the tears never come. I begin to wonder if everything I just said to her is even registering. \u201cSay something,\u201d I beg. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She doesn\u2019t make a sound. She doesn\u2019t even move. Her lack of reaction is starting to worry me, so I place my hand on the back of her head and lower my head closer to hers. \u201cPlease. Say something.\u201d</p><p>She slowly lifts her face away from my shoulder and she looks at me with dry eyes. \u201cYou called me Hope. Don\u2019t call me that. It\u2019s not my name.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t even realize I did. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sky.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes grow cold and she slides off me, then stands up. \u201cDon\u2019t call me that, either,\u201d she says.</p> <p>I stand up and take both of her hands, but she pulls away and turns toward the car. I haven\u2019t really thought out what I would do or say after she finally found out the truth from me. I\u2019m not at all prepared for whatever comes next.</p><p>\u201cI need a chapter break,\u201d she says, continuing to walk away.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know what that means,\u201d I say, following behind her. Whatever she needs, it\u2019s more than just a chapter break. She needs a chapter break within a chapter break within a chapter break. I can\u2019t imagine how confused she must be right now.</p><p>She continues to walk away so I grab her arm but she immediately jerks away from me. She spins around and her eyes are wide with fear and confusion. She begins to take deep breaths like she\u2019s attempting to hold off a panic attack. I don\u2019t know what to say to her and I know she doesn\u2019t want me to touch her right now.</p><p>She takes two quick steps forward and she reaches up and grabs my face, standing on the tips of her toes. She presses her lips firmly to mine and kisses me desperately, but I can\u2019t find it in me to kiss her back. I know she\u2019s just scared and confused right now and she\u2019s doing whatever she can to not think about it.</p> <p>She pulls away from my mouth when she realizes I\u2019m not kissing her back, then she reaches up and slaps me.</p><p>What she\u2019s experiencing right now is more than likely more traumatic and more emotional than anything someone can experience in life, short of death. I try to remember that when she reaches up and slaps me again, then pushes against my chest. Panic consumes her completely and she\u2019s screaming and hitting me and the only thing I can do is spin her around and pull her against my chest. I wrap my arms around her from behind and press my lips to her ear. \u201cBreathe,\u201d I whisper. \u201cCalm down, Sky. I know you\u2019re confused and scared, but I\u2019m here. I\u2019m right here. Just breathe.\u201d</p><p>I hold her for several minutes, allowing her time to gather her thoughts. I know she has questions. I just need her mind to the point that it can handle all the answers.</p><p>\u201cWere you ever going to tell me who I was?\u201d she asks after she pulls away from me. \u201cWhat if I never remembered? Would you have ever told me? Were you scared I would leave you and you\u2019d never get your chance to screw me? Is that why you\u2019ve been lying to me this whole time?\u201d</p><p>The questions she just asked have all been my biggest fears. I\u2019ve been so scared she wouldn\u2019t understand my reasoning for not telling her. \u201cNo. That\u2019s not how it was. That\u2019s not how it is. I haven\u2019t told you because I\u2019m scared of what will happen to you. If I report it, they\u2019ll take you from Karen. They\u2019ll more than likely arrest her and send you back to live with your father until you turn eighteen. Do you want that to happen? You love Karen and you\u2019re happy here. I didn\u2019t want to mess that up for you.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head and laughs a disheartening laugh. \u201cFirst of all,\u201d she says. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t put Karen in jail because I can guarantee you she knows nothing about this. Second, I\u2019ve been eighteen since September. If my age was the reason you weren\u2019t being honest, you would have told me by now.\u201d</p> <p>I look down at the ground because it\u2019s too hard to look her in the eyes.</p><p>\u201cSky, there\u2019s so much I still need to explain to you,\u201d I say. \u201cYour birthday wasn\u2019t in September. Your birthday is May 7. You don\u2019t even turn eighteen for six more months. And Karen?\u201d I walk forward and take her hands. \u201cShe has to know, Sky. She has to. Think about it. Who else could have done this?\u201d</p><p>As soon as I say it, she pulls her hands from mine and steps back like I\u2019ve just insulted her.</p><p>\u201cTake me home,\u201d she says, shaking her head in disbelief. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear anything else. I don\u2019t want to know anything else tonight.\u201d</p><p>I grab her by the hands again and she slaps them away. \u201cTAKE ME HOME!\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re parked in her driveway sitting silently in her car. I made her promise me she wouldn\u2019t say anything to Karen during the drive back to her house. She says she isn\u2019t going to say anything until we talk again tomorrow, but I still don\u2019t like the thought of leaving her here in the condition she\u2019s in.</p><p>She pulls open the door, but I grab her hand. \u201cWait,\u201d I say. She pauses. \u201cWill you be okay tonight?\u201d</p><p>She sighs and falls back against the passenger seat. \u201cHow?\u201d she says with a defeated voice. \u201cHow can I possibly be okay after tonight?\u201d</p> <p>I push her hair behind her ear. I don\u2019t want to leave her. I want to reassure her that I\u2019m not walking away from her this time. \u201cIt\u2019s killing me . . . letting you go like this,\u201d I say. \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave you alone. Can I come back in an hour?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head no. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she says weakly. \u201cIt\u2019s too hard being around you right now. I just need to think. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow, okay?\u201d</p><p>I nod, then pull my hand back and place it on the steering wheel. As much as it hurts, I need to give her what she wants right now. I know she needs time to process all the things going through her mind. To be honest, I think I need time to process it, too.</p><p>Chapter Forty</p><p>Les,</p><p>She knows.</p><p>And I can\u2019t believe I just dropped her off at her house and left. I don\u2019t care if she doesn\u2019t want to be around me right now. There\u2019s no way in hell I can just leave her alone. I wish you were here right now because I don\u2019t know what the hell I\u2019m doing.</p><p>I shoot straight up when I hear her scream next to me on her bed. She\u2019s gasping for breath.</p><p>Another nightmare.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d she says.</p><p>I glance down at my watch, then rub my eyes. I\u2019m trying to sort out what all has been real in the past few hours and what all was a dream.</p><p>Unfortunately, it was all real.</p><p>I place my hand on her leg and scoot closer to her. Her eyes are terrified. \u201cI couldn\u2019t leave you. I just needed to make sure you were okay.\u201d I slide my hand around her neck and her pulse is pounding against my palm. \u201cYour heart. You\u2019re scared.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s looking at me wide-eyed. Her chest is heaving and the fear rolling off her is breaking me. She brings her hand to mine and squeezes it. \u201cHolder . . . I remember.\u201d</p><p>I immediately turn her to face me and I force her eyes up to mine. \u201cWhat do you remember?\u201d I ask, nervous for her answer.</p><p>She begins to shake her head, not wanting to say it. I need her to say it, though. I need to know what she remembers. I nod my head, silently coaxing her to continue. She takes a deep breath. \u201cIt was Karen in that car. She did it. She\u2019s the one who took me.\u201d</p><p>This is exactly what I didn\u2019t want her to feel. I hug her. \u201cI know, babe. I know.\u201d</p><p>She clings to my shirt and I tighten my grip, but push her away as soon as her bedroom door swings open.</p><p>\u201cSky?\u201d Karen says, watching us from the doorway.</p><p>Karen looks at me, trying to figure out why I\u2019m here. She turns back to Sky. \u201cSky? What . . . what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Sky spins back around and looks me desperately in the eyes. \u201cGet me out of here,\u201d she begs in a whisper. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>I nod, then stand up and walk to her closet. I don\u2019t know where she wants to go, but I know she\u2019ll need clothes. I find a duffel bag on the top shelf, then walk it to her bed. \u201cThrow some clothes in here. I\u2019ll get what you need out of the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>She nods and heads to her closet while I head into her bathroom to grab whatever else she might need. Karen is pleading with her not to leave. When my hands are full, I walk out of the bathroom and Karen has her hands on Sky\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? What\u2019s wrong with you? You\u2019re not leaving with him.\u201d</p><p>I walk around Karen and try to remain as calm as possible for all of our sakes. \u201cKaren, I suggest you let go of her.\u201d</p><p>Karen spins around, shocked at my words. \u201cYou are not taking her. If you so much as walk out of this house with her, I\u2019m calling the police.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t say anything. I\u2019m not sure if Sky wants her to know that she knows the truth, so I do my best to refrain from saying what I\u2019ve wanted to say to Karen since the moment I realized she\u2019s the one responsible. I zip the duffel bag and reach for Sky\u2019s hand. \u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>She nods.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a joke!\u201d Karen yells. \u201cI\u2019ll call the police! You have no right to take her!\u201d</p><p>Sky reaches into my pocket and pulls out my cell phone, then steps toward Karen. \u201cHere,\u201d she says. \u201cCall them.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s testing Karen. Her wheels are churning as fast as mine and she\u2019s hoping she can prove that Karen is innocent in all of this. It makes my heart break for her, because I know Karen isn\u2019t innocent. This is only going to end badly.</p><p>Karen refuses to take the phone and Sky grabs her hand and shoves the phone into her palm. \u201cCall them! Call the police, Mom! Please,\u201d she says. Sky\u2019s eyebrows draw apart and she pleads desperately, one last time. \u201cPlease,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>I can\u2019t watch Sky endure this for another second, so I grab her hand and lead her to the window, then help her climb out of it.</p><p>Chapter Forty-one</p><p>I lift my head off the pillow and immediately cover my eyes. The afternoon sun is so bright, it\u2019s painful. I pry my arm from around her and quietly lift off the bed.</p><p>I somehow managed the whole drive to Austin last night. I don\u2019t think I could have stayed awake another minute, so I pulled over at the first hotel we could find. It was daytime when we finally made it to our room, so we both took turns showering, then crashed. She\u2019s been asleep for over six hours now and I know how much she needs it.</p><p>I softly brush the hair away from her cheek and lean down and kiss it. She pulls her arm out from under the blanket and looks up at me with tired eyes. \u201cHey,\u201d she whispers, somehow smiling despite everything she\u2019s going through.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d I say, not wanting her to wake up just yet. \u201cI\u2019m about to leave for a little while to get us something to eat. I\u2019ll wake you when I get back, okay?\u201d</p><p>She nods and closes her eyes, then rolls back over.</p><p>After we finish eating, she walks to the bed and slips on her shoes. \u201cWhere you headed?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>She ties her shoes and stands up, wrapping her arms around my neck. \u201cI want to go for a walk,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I want you to go with me. I\u2019m ready to start asking questions.\u201d</p><p>I give her a quick kiss, then grab the key and head to the door. \u201cThen let\u2019s go.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We eventually make our way to the hotel courtyard and take a seat in one of the cabanas.

Or do you have specific questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I want to hear your story first.\u201d</p><p>I kiss her on the side of the head, then rest my head against hers while we stare out over the courtyard. \u201cYou have to understand how surreal this feels for me, Sky. I\u2019ve thought about what happened to you every single day for the past thirteen years. And to think I\u2019ve been living two miles away from you for seven of those years? I\u2019m still having a hard time processing it myself. And now, finally having you here, telling you everything that happened . . .\u201d</p><p>I sigh, remembering back to that day. \u201cAfter the car pulled away, I went into the house and told Les that you left with someone. She kept asking me who, but I didn\u2019t know. My mother was in the kitchen, so I went and told her. She didn\u2019t really pay any attention to me. She was cooking supper and we were just kids. She had learned to tune us out. Besides, I still wasn\u2019t sure anything had happened that wasn\u2019t supposed to happen, so I didn\u2019t sound panicked or anything. She told me to just go outside and play with Les. The way she was so nonchalant about it made me think everything was okay. Being so young, I was positive adults knew everything, so I didn\u2019t say anything else about it. Les and I went outside to play and another couple of hours had passed by when your dad came outside, calling your name. As soon as I heard him call your name, I froze. I stopped in the middle of my yard and watched him standing on his porch, calling for you. It was that moment that I knew he had no idea you had left with someone. I knew I did something wrong.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHolder,\u201d she interrupts. \u201cYou were just a little boy.\u201d</p><p>Yeah. A little boy who was old enough to know the difference between right and wrong. \u201cYour dad walked over to our yard and asked me if I knew where you were.\u201d This is where it gets hard for me. This is the point I realized the awful mistake I had made. \u201cSky, you have to understand something,\u201d I say to her. \u201cI was scared of your father. I was just a kid and knew I had just done something terribly wrong by leaving you alone. Now your police chief father is standing over me, his gun visible on his uniform. I panicked. I ran back into my house and ran straight to my bedroom and locked the door. He and my mother beat on the door for half an hour, but I was too scared to open it and admit to them that I knew what happened. My reaction worried both of them, so he immediately radioed for backup. When I heard the police cars pull up outside, I thought they were there for me. I still didn\u2019t understand what had happened to you. By the time my mother coaxed me out of the room, three hours had already passed since you left in the car.\u201d</p><p>She can feel how much this hurts me to talk about. She pulls one of her hands out of the sleeve of her shirt and places it in mine.</p><p>\u201cI was taken to the station and questioned for hours. They wanted to know if I knew the license plate number, what kind of car took you, what the person looked like, what they said to you. Sky, I didn\u2019t know anything. I couldn\u2019t even remember the color of the car. All I could tell them was exactly what you were wearing, because you were the only thing I could picture in my head. Your dad was furious with me. I could hear him yelling in the hallway of the station that if I had just told someone right when it happened, they would have been able to find you. He blamed me. When a police officer blames you for losing his daughter, you tend to believe he knows what he\u2019s talking about. Les heard him yelling, too, so she thought it was all my fault. For days, she wouldn\u2019t even talk to me. Both of us were trying to understand what had happened. For almost six years we lived in this perfect world where adults are always right and bad things don\u2019t happen to good people. Then, in the span of a minute, you were taken and everything we thought we knew turned out to be this false image of life that our parents had built for us. We realized that day that even adults do horrible things. Children disappear. Best friends get taken from you and you have no idea if they\u2019re even alive anymore.</p><p>\u201cWe watched the news constantly, waiting for reports. For weeks they would show your picture on TV, asking for leads. The most recent picture they had of you was from right before your mother died, when you were only three. I remember that pissing me off, wondering how almost two years could have gone by without someone having taken a more recent picture. They would show pictures of your house and would sometimes show our house, too. Every now and then, they would mention the boy next door who saw it happen, but couldn\u2019t remember any details. I remember one night . . . the last night my mother allowed us to watch the coverage on TV . . . one of the reporters showed a panned-out image of both our houses. They mentioned the only witness, but referred to me as \u2018The boy who lost Hope.\u2019 It infuriated my mother so bad; she ran outside and began screaming at the reporters, yelling at them to leave us alone. To leave me alone. My dad had to drag her back inside the house.</p> <p>\u201cMy parents did their best to try to make our life as normal as possible. After a couple of months, the reporters stopped showing up. The endless trips to the police station for more questioning finally stopped. Things began to slowly return to normal for everyone in the neighborhood. Everyone but Les and me. It was like all of our hope was taken right along with our Hope.\u201d</p><p>She sighs when I\u2019ve finished and she\u2019s quiet for a while. \u201cI\u2019ve spent so many years hating my father for giving up on me,\u201d she says. \u201cI can\u2019t believe she just took me from him. How could she do that? How could anyone do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, babe.\u201d</p><p>She sits up in the chair and looks me in the eyes. \u201cI need to see the house,\u201d she says. \u201cI want more memories, but I don\u2019t have any and right now it\u2019s hard. I can barely remember anything, much less him. I just want to drive by. I need to see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I want to go before it gets dark.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter Forty-two</p><p>I should never have let her come here. As soon as we pulled up in front of the house, I could tell just looking at it wouldn\u2019t be enough for her. Sure enough, she got out of the car and demanded to see the inside of it. I tried to talk her out of it, but I can only do so much.</p><p>I\u2019m standing outside her window, waiting. I don\u2019t want her to be in there right now, but I could clearly see that she\u2019s not having it any other way. I lean against the house and hope she hurries the hell up. It doesn\u2019t look like any of the neighbors are home, but that doesn\u2019t mean her father isn\u2019t going to drive up any second now.</p><p>I look down at the ground beneath my feet, then glance behind me at the house. This is the exact spot she was standing in when I walked away from her thirteen years ago. I close my eyes and rest my head against the house. I never expected I\u2019d ever be back here with her again.</p><p>My eyes flash open and I stand up straight the second I hear the crash come from inside her bedroom, followed by screaming. I don\u2019t give myself time to question what the hell is going on in there. I just run.</p><p>I run through the back door and down the hall until I\u2019m in her old bedroom with her. She\u2019s crying hysterically and throwing things across the room, so I immediately wrap my arms around her from behind to calm her down. I have no idea what the hell brought this on, but I\u2019m at an even bigger loss how to stop it. She\u2019s frantically jerking against me, attempting to get out of my hold, but I just grip her even tighter. \u201cStop,\u201d I say against her ear. She\u2019s still frantic and I need her to calm down before someone hears her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me!\u201d she screams. She claws at my arms but I don\u2019t relent, even for a second. She eventually weakens and becomes defeated by whatever it is that has hold of her mind right now. She grows limp in my arms and I know I need to get her out of here, but I can\u2019t have her reacting like this once I get her outside.</p><p>I loosen my grip and turn her around to face me. She falls against my chest and sobs, grabbing fistfuls of my shirt while she tries to hold herself up. I lower my mouth to her ear.</p> <p>\u201cSky. You need to leave. Now.\u201d I\u2019m trying to be strong for her, but I also need her to know that being here is a very bad idea. Especially after she\u2019s just destroyed the entire room. He\u2019ll know someone was here for a fact now, so we need to leave.</p><p>I pick her up and carry her out of the bedroom. She keeps her face buried in my chest while I walk her outside and to the car. I reach into the backseat and hand her my jacket.</p><p>\u201cHere, use that to wipe off the blood. I\u2019m going back inside to straighten up what I can.\u201d</p><p>I watch her for a few seconds to make sure she\u2019s not about to panic again, then I shut the door and head back inside to her bedroom. I straighten up what I can, but the mirror is a hard one to cover up. I\u2019m hoping that her father doesn\u2019t come into this room very often. If I can make it look like nothing outside this room was disturbed, it could be weeks before he even notices the mirror.</p><p>I put the blanket back on the bed and hang the curtains back up, then head back outside. When I reach the car, just the sight of her is enough to nearly bring me to my knees.</p><p>This isn\u2019t her.</p><p>She\u2019s scared. Broken. She\u2019s shaking and crying and I\u2019m wondering for the first time if any of the decisions I\u2019ve made over the last twenty-four hours have been smart ones.</p><p>I put the car in drive and pull away from the house, never wanting to see it or think about it again. I hope to hell she doesn\u2019t, either. I place my hand on the back of her head, which is tucked against her knees. I run my fingers through her hair and don\u2019t move my hand away from her the entire drive back to the hotel. I need her to know that I\u2019m here. That no matter how she feels right now, she\u2019s not alone. If I\u2019ve learned anything from losing her all those years ago or from what happened with Les, it\u2019s that I never want to let her feel alone again.</p><p>Once we\u2019re back inside the hotel room, I help her down onto the bed, then grab a wet rag and come back and inspect the cuts.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a few scratches,\u201d I say. \u201cNothing too deep.\u201d</p><p>I remove my shoes and climb onto the bed with her. I pull the blanket over us and rest her head against my chest while she cries.</p><p>The length of time she cries and the desperation with which she\u2019s holding on to me make me hate myself for allowing this to happen to her. I was careless last night and didn\u2019t think to keep her out of Les\u2019s room. She wouldn\u2019t be experiencing any of this now had she not seen that photo. Then she would never have gone back into that house.</p><p>She lifts her gaze to mine and her eyes are so sad. I wipe away her tears and lower my mouth to hers, kissing her softly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should have never let you go inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHolder, you didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Stop apologizing.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have taken you there. It\u2019s too much for you to deal with after just finding everything out.\u201d</p><p>She lifts up onto her elbow. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just being there that was too much. It was what I remembered that was too much. You have no control over the things my father did to me. Stop placing blame on yourself for everything bad that happens to the people around you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The things he did to her? I slide my hand to the base of her neck. \u201cWhat are you talking about? What things did he do to you?\u201d</p><p>She squeezes her eyes shut and drops her head to my chest, then starts crying again. The answer she\u2019s refusing to give me right now completely rips apart my heart. \u201cNo, Sky,\u201d I whisper. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m overcome with several different emotions at once. I\u2019ve never wanted to hurt someone like I want to hurt her bastard of a father, and if she didn\u2019t need me here with her right now I\u2019d be on my way back to his house.</p><p>I close my eyes and can\u2019t get the thought of her as a little girl out of my head. Even when I was a little boy, I could tell she was broken, and she was the first thing I ever felt the urge to protect. And now, curled up against me, crying . . . the only thing I want to do is protect her from him, but I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t protect her from all the memories that are flooding her mind right now and I\u2019d give anything if I could.</p> <p>She clenches my shirt in her fists and the sobs continue. I hold her as tightly as I can, knowing there\u2019s nothing I can do to make her pain go away, so I just hold her like I used to hold Les. I never want to let her go.</p><p>She continues to cry and I continue to hold her and I\u2019m trying so hard to be strong for her right now but I\u2019m breaking. Knowing what happened to her and all she\u2019s had to live through is completely unhinging me and I have no idea how she\u2019s even able to hold up at all.</p><p>After several minutes, her tears begin to soften but they never cease. She eventually lifts her face off my chest, then slides on top of me. She closes her eyes and brings her lips to mine, then she immediately tries to take off my shirt. I have no idea why she\u2019s doing this, so I flip her onto her back. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>She slides her hand behind my neck and pulls my mouth back to hers. As much as I love kissing her, this just doesn\u2019t feel right. When her hands grab at my shirt again, I push them away. \u201cStop it,\u201d I tell her. \u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d</p><p>She looks at me with desperation. \u201cHave sex with me.\u201d</p> <p>What the fuck?</p><p>I immediately climb off the bed and pace the floor. I don\u2019t even know how the hell to respond to that, especially after what she just remembered about her father. \u201cSky, I can\u2019t do this,\u201d I say, pausing to look at her. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re even asking for this right now.\u201d</p><p>She crawls to the edge of the bed where I\u2019m standing and she pulls up onto her knees, grasping at my shirt. \u201cPlease,\u201d she begs. \u201cPlease, Holder. I need this.\u201d</p><p>I step away from her, out of her grasp. \u201cI\u2019m not doing this, Sky. We\u2019re not doing this. You\u2019re in shock or something . . . I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t even know what to say right now.\u201d</p><p>She falls back down onto the bed and begins to cry again.</p><p>Dammit. I don\u2019t know how to help her. I\u2019m completely unprepared for this.</p> <p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she says, looking me in the eyes. Her voice and the pain behind it is shattering me from the inside out. She drops her eyes to her hands, which are folded in her lap. \u201cHolder . . . he\u2019s the only one that\u2019s ever done that to me.\u201d She lifts her eyes to mine again. \u201cI need you to take that away from him. Please.\u201d</p><p>If I had a soul before those words, it just completely broke in half. Tears fill my eyes and I hurt for her. I hurt for her so much because I don\u2019t want her to ever have to think about that bastard again. \u201cPlease, Holder,\u201d she says again.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what to do or how to deal with all of this. If I tell her no, I\u2019ll hurt her even more. If I agree to help her by doing this; I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to forgive myself.</p><p>She\u2019s looking up at me from the bed, completely broken. Her pleading eyes are waiting for my decision. And even though neither option is one I want to choose, I just go with whatever she thinks she needs right now. If I could trade lives with her I would do it in a heartbeat, just so she\u2019d never have to feel whatever it is she\u2019s feeling. I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to ease her pain.</p><p>Whatever it takes.</p><p>I walk back to her and sink to my knees on the floor. I scoot her to the edge of the bed, then I remove both our shirts. I pick her up and walk her to the head of the bed and lay her down gently. I lower myself on top of her, then wipe her tears away again.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say to her.</p> <p>I know she more than likely just wants to get this over with. There\u2019s no way this moment can be what it should be. I reach to my wallet and remove a condom, then take off my pants, watching her diligently the entire time. I don\u2019t want her to panic during this like she did last night, so I watch for any signs that she\u2019s changed her mind. She\u2019s been through enough. I just want to do whatever I can to help her, and if this will help her, it\u2019s what I\u2019ll do.</p><p>I kiss her the whole time I\u2019m taking off her clothes. I don\u2019t even try to make it romantic. I just try to think whatever thoughts about her I can think that will help me get this over with faster.</p><p>Once her clothes are off, I put on the condom and ease myself against her. \u201cSky,\u201d I say, praying she\u2019ll ask me to stop. I don\u2019t want it to be like this for her.</p><p>She opens her eyes and shakes her head. \u201cNo, don\u2019t think about it. Just do it, Holder.\u201d</p><p>Her voice is completely emotionless. I squeeze my eyes shut and bury my face in her neck. \u201cI just don\u2019t know how to deal with all of this. I don\u2019t know if this is wrong or if it\u2019s what you really need. I\u2019m scared if I do this, I\u2019ll make it even harder for you.\u201d</p><p>She wraps her arms tightly around my neck and she begins to cry again. Rather than release me, she just pulls me tighter and lifts her hips in a silent plea for me to keep going.</p><p>I kiss her on the side of her head and give her what she needs. The moment I push into her, tears escape my eyes. She never makes a sound. She just keeps herself wrapped tightly around me and I go through the motions, trying desperately not to think about how different I wanted this to be.</p><p>I try not to think about how I feel like I\u2019m taking advantage of her with every movement against her.</p><p>I try not to think about how doing this makes me feel like I\u2019m no better than her father.</p><p>That thought freezes me. I\u2019m still inside her, but I can\u2019t move. I can\u2019t do this to her for another second.</p><p>I pull away from her neck and look down at her, then roll off her completely. I sit on the edge of the bed and fist my hands in my hair.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do it,\u201d I say to her. \u201cIt feels wrong, Sky. It feels wrong because you feel so good but I\u2019m regretting every single fucking second of it.\u201d I stand up and toss the empty condom into the trashcan, pull my clothes back on, then walk to the door, knowing I\u2019m letting her down again.</p><p>I make my way outside and, as soon as I\u2019m alone in the parking lot, I scream out of frustration. I pace the sidewalk for a while, trying to figure out what to do. I turn and hit the building, over and over, then fall against the brick wall and wonder how the hell I\u2019ve let her end up here. How the hell did I allow it to ever get to this point? The last twenty-four hours of my life have been one huge, colossal fuck-up.</p><p>And here I am, walking away from her again. Doing what I do best. Leaving her completely alone.</p><p>Wanting to rectify at least one of my bad decisions, I immediately walk back into the hotel, back into the hotel room. When I make it inside, she\u2019s in the bathroom, so I sit on the bed and pick up my shirt, then wrap it around my now-bleeding hand.</p><p>The bathroom door opens and she pauses midstep, just as I look up at her. Her eyes drop to my hand and she immediately rushes to me, unwrapping the shirt to inspect my hand.</p><p>\u201cHolder, what\u2019d you do?\u201d she says, twisting my hand back and forth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I say, wrapping my hand back up. I stand up and look down at her, wondering how the hell she could possibly be worried about me right now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she says quietly. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have asked you to do that. I just needed . . .\u201d</p><p>Jesus. She\u2019s apologizing to me? \u201cShut up,\u201d I say, taking her face in my hands. \u201cYou have absolutely nothing to apologize for. I didn\u2019t leave earlier because I was mad at you. I left because I was mad at myself.\u201d</p><p>She nods, then pulls away from me and walks to the bed. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she says, lifting the covers. \u201cI can\u2019t expect you to want me in that way right now. It was wrong and selfish and way out of line for me to ask you to do that and I\u2019m really sorry. Let\u2019s just go to sleep, okay?\u201d She climbs into the bed and pulls the covers over her.</p><p>I\u2019m trying to process her words, but they aren\u2019t making any sense. I don\u2019t feel that way about what she asked me to do at all. How the hell did she ever get these crazy thoughts in her head to begin with?</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m having a hard time with this because I don\u2019t want you?\u201d I walk to the bed and kneel next to her. \u201cSky, I\u2019m having a hard time with this because everything that\u2019s happened to you is breaking my fucking heart and I have no idea how to help you.\u201d I climb onto the bed with her and pull her to a sitting position with me. \u201cI want to be there for you and help you through this but every word that comes out of my mouth feels like the wrong one. Every time I touch you or kiss you, I\u2019m afraid you don\u2019t want me to. Now you\u2019re asking me to have sex with you because you want to take that from him, and I get it. I absolutely get where you\u2019re coming from, but it doesn\u2019t make it easier to make love to you when you can\u2019t even look me in the eyes. It hurts so much because you don\u2019t deserve for it to be like this. You don\u2019t deserve this life and there isn\u2019t a fucking thing I can do to make it better for you. I want to make it better but I can\u2019t and I feel so helpless.\u201d</p><p>I take her in my arms and she wraps her legs around me, hanging on to every word I\u2019m saying.</p><p>\u201cAnd even though I stopped, I should have never even started without telling you first how much I love you. I love you so much. I don\u2019t deserve to touch you until you know for a fact that I\u2019m touching you because I love you and for no other reason.\u201d</p><p>I press my lips to hers desperately, needing her to know that I\u2019m speaking nothing but truth now. Every word I speak and every time I touch her, there\u2019s nothing there but honesty.</p><p>She pulls away and kisses my chin and my forehead and my cheek, then my lips again. \u201cI love you, too,\u201d she says, proving to me that words are yet another characteristic someone can fall in love with. But I\u2019m not falling in love with her piece by piece anymore. I\u2019m in love with the whole girl. Every single piece of her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do right now if I didn\u2019t have you, Holder. I love you so much and I\u2019m so sorry. I wanted you to be my first, and I\u2019m sorry he took that from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you ever say that again,\u201d I tell her. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever think that again. Your father took that first from you in an unthinkable way, but I can guarantee you that\u2019s all he took. Because you are so strong, Sky. You\u2019re amazing and funny and smart and beautiful and so full of strength and courage. What he did to you doesn\u2019t take away from any of the best parts of you. You survived him once and you\u2019ll survive him again. I know you will.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I place my palm over her heart, then pull her hand to my heart. I lower my eyes to her level, making sure she\u2019s completely in this moment with me. \u201cFuck all the firsts, Sky. The only thing that matters to me with you are the forevers.\u201d</p><p>She releases a breath of relief, then completely kisses the hell out of me. I grab her head and lower her back onto the bed, climbing on top of her. \u201cI love you,\u201d I say against her lips. \u201cI\u2019ve loved you for so long but I just couldn\u2019t tell you. It didn\u2019t feel right letting you love me back when I was keeping so much from you.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s crying again, but she\u2019s also smiling. \u201cI don\u2019t think you could have picked a better time to tell me you loved me than tonight. I\u2019m happy you waited.\u201d</p><p>I dip my head and kiss her. I kiss her like she deserves to be kissed. I hold her like she deserves to be held. And I\u2019m about to make love to her like she deserves to be loved. I untie the robe she\u2019s wearing and slide my hand across her stomach. \u201cGod, I love you,\u201d I say to her. My hand moves from her waist, down her hip and to her thigh. I can feel her tense up, so I pull back and look down at her. \u201cRemember . . . I\u2019m touching you because I love you. No other reason.\u201d</p> <p>She nods and closes her eyes and I recognize the nervousness seeping off her. I pull her robe closed and bring my hand to her face.</p><p>\u201cOpen your eyes,\u201d I say. She opens them and they\u2019re full of tears. \u201cYou\u2019re crying.\u201d</p><p>She just nods and smiles up at me. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. They\u2019re the good kind of tears.\u201d</p><p>I silently watch her, gauging if we should even be doing this right now. I want to show her how much I love her and I want to erase what happened between us an hour ago, because it never should have happened. I want to make it right for her. It\u2019s always been so ugly for her, but she deserves to see how beautiful it can be.</p><p>\u201cI want to make love to you, Sky,\u201d I say, lacing our fingers together. \u201cAnd I think you want it, too. But I need you to understand something first.\u201d I lower my mouth and kiss away a falling tear. \u201cI know it\u2019s hard for you to allow yourself to feel this. You\u2019ve gone so long training yourself to block the feelings and emotions out any time someone touches you. But I want you to know that what your father physically did to you isn\u2019t what hurt you as a little girl. It\u2019s what he did to your faith in him that broke your heart. You suffered through one of the worst things a child can go through at the hands of your hero . . . the person you idolized . . . and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine what that must have felt like. But remember that the things he did to you are in no way related to the two of us when we\u2019re together like this. When I touch you, I\u2019m touching you because I want to make you happy. When I kiss you, I\u2019m kissing you because you have the most incredible mouth I\u2019ve ever seen and you know I can\u2019t not kiss it. And when I make love to you\u2014I\u2019m doing exactly that. I\u2019m making love to you because I\u2019m in love with you. The negative feeling you\u2019ve been associating with physical touch your whole life doesn\u2019t apply to me. It doesn\u2019t apply to us. I\u2019m touching you because I\u2019m in love with you and for no other reason.\u201d I kiss her softly. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p> <p>She kisses me harder than she\u2019s ever kissed me, pulling me down to the bed with her. We continue to kiss and she continues to allow me to explore every single part of her with my mouth and my hands. When I ready myself against her after putting another condom on, I look down at her and she\u2019s finally looking up at me with a serene expression. The love in her eyes right now can\u2019t be mistaken, but I still want to hear her say it.</p><p>\u201cTell me you love me.\u201d</p><p>She tightens her grip around me, looking me hard in the eyes. \u201cI love you, Holder. So much,\u201d she says firmly. \u201cAnd just so you know . . . so did Hope.\u201d</p><p>As soon as the words leave her mouth, I\u2019m completely consumed by a sense of peace. For the first time since the second she was taken from me, I finally know what forgiveness feels like. \u201cI wish you could feel what that just did to me.\u201d I claim her mouth with mine at the same time she completely consumes my heart.</p><p>Chapter Forty-three</p><p>When I turn my phone on, I\u2019m flooded with texts. Several from Breckin, several from my mother. There are missed calls from Sky\u2019s phone, so I can only assume they\u2019re from Karen. I don\u2019t listen to any of the voicemails, though. I know everyone\u2019s just worried about us, especially Karen. I\u2019m still not sure how what she did fits into the picture, but I find it hard to believe that what she did was done from a place of evil.</p> <p>Sky rustles in the bed, rolling over. I look down at her and lean forward to kiss her but she turns her face away and I kiss her cheek, instead.</p><p>\u201cMorning breath,\u201d she mumbles, sliding off the bed. She heads for the shower and I check the time. Check-out is in an hour, so I decide to gather our things.</p><p>After I\u2019ve got most of our things packed, she walks out of the bathroom. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I glance at her. \u201cWe can\u2019t stay here forever, Sky. We need to figure out what you want to do.\u201d</p><p>She rushes toward me. \u201cBut . . . but I don\u2019t know yet. I don\u2019t even have anywhere to go.\u201d</p><p>Her voice is full of panic, so I walk to her in order to ease her mind. \u201cYou have me, Sky. Calm down. We can go back to my house and figure this out. Besides, we\u2019re both still in school. We can\u2019t just stop going and we definitely can\u2019t live in a hotel forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne more day,\u201d she says. \u201cPlease, let\u2019s just stay one more day, then we\u2019ll go. I need to try to figure this out and in order to do that, I need to go there one more time.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know how she can possibly think going back to that house is in any way a good idea. There\u2019s absolutely nothing she needs from there. \u201cNo way. I\u2019m not putting you through that again. You\u2019re not going back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI need to, Holder,\u201d she says pleadingly. \u201cI swear I won\u2019t get out of the car this time. I swear. But I need to see the house again before we go. I remembered so much while I was there. I just want a few more memories before you take me back and I have to decide what to do.\u201d</p><p>Jesus, she\u2019s relentless. I pace the floor, not knowing how I can get it through her head that she can\u2019t do this.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she says again.</p><p>Ugh! I can\u2019t say no to that voice.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I groan. \u201cI told you I would do whatever it was you felt you needed to do. But I\u2019m not hanging all of those clothes back up.\u201d</p><p>She laughs and rushes to me, throwing her arms around my neck. \u201cYou\u2019re the best, most understanding boyfriend in the whole wide world.\u201d</p><p>I hug her back and sigh. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not. I\u2019m the most whipped boyfriend in the whole wide world.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re sitting in my car across the street from her old house and I\u2019m gripping the steering wheel so hard I\u2019m afraid I might break it. Her father just pulled up into his driveway, and as mad and outraged as I\u2019ve been in the past, I\u2019ve never had the urge to actually kill someone until now. Just seeing him makes my stomach turn and my blood boil. I lift my hand to the ignition, knowing nothing good can come of this if I don\u2019t drive away right now.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave,\u201d she says, pulling my hand away from the ignition. \u201cI need to see what he looks like.\u201d</p><p>I sigh and fall back against the seat. She needs to hurry up and get what she needs because this is bad. This is bad, bad, bad.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d she whispers. I turn to her, wanting to know what made her just say that. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d she says. \u201cHe just looks . . . familiar. I haven\u2019t had an image of him in my head at all but if I was to see him walking down the street, I would know him.\u201d</p><p>We watch as he ends a conversation on his cell phone and walks to the mailbox.</p><p>\u201cHave you had enough?\u201d I ask her. \u201cBecause I can\u2019t stay here another second without jumping out of this car and beating his ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost,\u201d she says, leaning across the seat to get a better look. I don\u2019t understand why she would even want to see him. I don\u2019t understand how she\u2019s not jumping out of this car in order to rip his balls off, because that\u2019s the only urge I have right now.</p><p>After her father finally disappears inside his house, I turn and look at her.</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cYeah, we can go now.\u201d</p><p>I place my hand on the ignition and crank the car, then watch in horror as she swings open the door and rushes out of the car.</p><p>What the fuck?</p><p>I turn the car off and swing open my door, running after her. I chase her all the way across the front yard and halfway up the porch steps. I wrap my arms around her and lift her up, then turn back to the car. She\u2019s trying to fight me and kick me and I\u2019m doing everything I can to get her as far away from the house as I can so he doesn\u2019t hear her.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d I say through clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cLet go of me right now, Holder, or I\u2019ll scream! I swear to God, I\u2019ll scream!\u201d</p><p>I let go of her and spin her around to face me. I grip her shoulders tightly and try to shake some goddamned sense into her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this, Sky. You don\u2019t need to face him again, not after what he\u2019s done. I want you to give yourself more time.\u201d</p><p>She looks at me and begins to shake her head. \u201cI have to know if he\u2019s doing this to anyone else. I need to know if he has more kids. I can\u2019t just let it go, knowing what he\u2019s capable of. I have to see him. I have to talk to him. I need to know that he\u2019s not that man anymore before I can allow myself to get back in that car and just drive away.\u201d</p><p>I take her face in my hands and try to reason with her. \u201cDon\u2019t do this. Not yet. We can make a few phone calls. We\u2019ll find out whatever we can online about him first. Please, Sky.\u201d I turn her toward the car and she sighs. She finally relents and begins walking toward the car with me.</p><p>\u201cIs there a problem here?\u201d</p><p>We both spin around at the sound of his voice. He\u2019s standing at the base of the porch steps, eyeing me carefully. If I wasn\u2019t having to physically prevent Sky from falling to the ground right now, I\u2019d be rushing him.</p><p>\u201cYoung lady, is this man hurting you?\u201d</p><p>She grows limp in my arms the second he speaks to her directly. I pull her against my chest. \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d I whisper. I turn her toward the car. I need to get her away from him. I just need to get her to the car.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move!\u201d he yells.</p><p>Sky freezes at the sound of his voice, but I\u2019m still trying to urge her toward the car.</p><p>\u201cTurn around!\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t force Sky forward at this point and there really isn\u2019t a way out of this situation. I begin to turn her around with me and keep my arm wrapped around her. She looks into my eyes and there\u2019s more terror in them than I ever imagined a single person could feel.</p><p>\u201cPlay it off,\u201d I whisper in her ear. \u201cHe might not recognize you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She nods and we both face her father now. I\u2019m not concerned with the fact that he may recognize me. Other than the day Hope went missing, he never spoke to me. I\u2019m just hoping to hell he doesn\u2019t recognize her, but I know he will. A parent would recognize his own child, no matter how long it\u2019s been.</p><p>He\u2019s making his way toward us, and the closer he gets, the more I see the recognition in his eyes. He knows her.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>He pauses when he\u2019s several feet from us and tries to look her in the eyes, but she presses herself against me and looks down at the ground.</p> <p>\u201cPrincess?\u201d he says.</p><p>She begins to slide out of my arms and I look down at her. Her eyes have rolled back into her head and she\u2019s falling. I keep a tight grip on her and ease her to the ground completely so that I can get a better grip on her. I need to get her out of here right now.</p><p>I slide my hands under her arms and try to pull her up. Her father comes closer and grabs her hands to help me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you fucking touch her!\u201d I scream. He immediately backs away, looking at me in shock.</p><p>I look back down at her and grab her head, trying to bring her back to consciousness.</p> <p>\u201cBaby, open your eyes. Please.\u201d</p><p>Her eyelids flutter open and she looks up at me. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I reassure her. \u201cYou just passed out. I need you to stand up. We need to leave.\u201d I pull her to her feet and steady her against me. I give her a second to regain her strength. Her father is right in front of her now.</p><p>\u201cIt is you,\u201d he says staring at her. He looks at me, then back to Sky. \u201cHope? Do you remember me?\u201d His eyes are full of tears.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d I say to her, attempting to pull her with me. She has to know how much I\u2019m trying to refrain from attacking him right now. We. Need. To. Leave.</p><p>She resists my pull as her father takes another step toward her, so I pull her a step away from him.</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d he says again. \u201cHope, do you remember me?\u201d</p> <p>Sky\u2019s whole body grows tense. \u201cHow could I forget you?\u201d she spits.</p><p>He sucks in a breath. \u201cIt\u2019s you,\u201d he says, fidgeting his hand down at his side. \u201cYou\u2019re alive. You\u2019re okay.\u201d He pulls out his radio, but I take a step forward and knock it out of his hand before he can report it.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t let anyone know she\u2019s here if I were you,\u201d I say. \u201cI doubt you would want the fact that you\u2019re a fucking pervert to be front-page news.\u201d</p><p>The blood drains from his face. \u201cWhat?\u201d He looks back at Sky and shakes his head. \u201cHope, whoever took you . . . they lied to you. They told you things about me that weren\u2019t true.\u201d He takes another step forward and I have to pull her back again. \u201cWho took you, Hope? Who was it?\u201d</p><p>She begins to shake her head back and forth. \u201cI remember everything you did to me,\u201d she says, taking a confident step toward him. \u201cAnd if you just give me what I\u2019m here for, I swear I\u2019ll walk away and you\u2019ll never hear from me again.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s shaking his head, not wanting to believe that she remembers. He watches her for a minute. I know he\u2019s just as caught off guard as we are.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it you want?\u201d he asks her.</p><p>\u201cAnswers,\u201d Sky says. \u201cAnd I want anything you have that belonged to my mother.\u201d</p> <p>Sky reaches down to my hand, which is wrapped around her waist, and she squeezes it. She\u2019s scared.</p><p>Her father glances at me, then back to Sky. \u201cWe can talk inside,\u201d he says quietly. He looks around the neighborhood nervously, making sure there aren\u2019t any witnesses. The fact that he\u2019s even looking for witnesses lights up a huge caution sign. There\u2019s no telling what this man is capable of.</p><p>\u201cLeave your gun,\u201d I demand.</p><p>He pauses, then removes his gun from his holster. He lays it on the porch.</p><p>\u201cBoth of them,\u201d I say.</p><p>He reaches down and removes the extra gun from his leg, laying it on the porch right before he walks into his house. I spin Sky around to face me before we walk through the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m staying right here with the door open. I don\u2019t trust him. Don\u2019t go any farther than the living room.\u201d</p><p>She nods and I give her a quick kiss, then watch her turn and step into the living room. She walks to the couch and takes a seat, eyeing him guardedly the entire time.</p><p>He raises his eyes to hers. \u201cBefore you say anything,\u201d he says. \u201cYou need to know that I loved you and I\u2019ve regretted what I did every second of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to know why you did it,\u201d she says.</p><p>He leans back in his seat and rubs his hands over his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter your mother died, I started drinking heavily again. It wasn\u2019t until a year later that I got so drunk one night that I woke up the next morning and knew I had done something terrible. I was hoping it was just a horrible dream, but when I went to wake you up that morning you were . . . different. You weren\u2019t the same happy little girl you used to be. Overnight, you somehow became someone who was terrified of me. I hated myself. I\u2019m not even sure what I did to you because I was too drunk to remember. But I knew it was something awful and I am so, so sorry. It never happened again and I did everything I could to make it up to you. I bought you presents all the time and gave you whatever you wanted. I didn\u2019t want you to remember that night.\u201d</p><p>She grips her knees and I can tell by the way she\u2019s struggling for breath that she\u2019s doing everything she can to remain calm.</p><p>\u201cIt was night . . . after night . . . after night,\u201d she says. I immediately rush to the couch and kneel next to her. I wrap my arm around her back and grip her arm so that she stays put. \u201cI was scared to go to bed and scared to wake up and scared to take a bath and scared to speak to you. I wasn\u2019t a little girl afraid of monsters in her closet or under her bed. I was terrified of the monster that was supposed to love me! You were supposed to be protecting me from the people like you!\u201d</p><p>The pain in her voice is heart-wrenching. I want her out of here. I don\u2019t want her to have to hear him speak.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any other children?\u201d she asks.</p><p>He drops his head and presses a palm to his forehead, but fails to answer her. \u201cDo you?\u201d she screams.</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cNo. I never remarried after your mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I the only one you did this to?\u201d</p><p>He keeps his eyes trained to the floor, avoiding her question.</p><p>\u201cYou owe me the truth,\u201d she says, her voice quiet now. \u201cDid you do this to anyone else before you did it to me?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a long silence. He\u2019s staring at the floor, unable to admit the truth. She\u2019s staring at him, waiting for him to give her what she came here for.</p><p>After a long silence, she begins to stand up. I grasp her arm but she looks me in the eyes and shakes her head. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she says. I don\u2019t want to let her go, but I have to allow her to handle this the way she wants to handle it.</p><p>She walks to him and kneels in front of him. \u201cI was sick,\u201d she says. \u201cMy mother and I . . . we were in my bed and you came home from work. She had been up with me all night and she was tired, so you told her to go get some rest.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s looking her in the eyes like a regretful father. I don\u2019t know how.</p><p>\u201cYou held me that night like a father is supposed to hold his daughter. And you sang to me. I remember you used to sing a song to me about your ray of hope. Before my mother died . . . before you had to deal with that heartache . . . you didn\u2019t always do those things to me, did you?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head and touches her face.</p><p>I have the urge to rip his hand off, just like all the urges I\u2019ve had to rip Grayson\u2019s hand off. Only this time I don\u2019t want to stop at his hand. I want to rip his head off and his balls off and . . .</p><p>\u201cNo, Hope,\u201d he says to her. \u201cI loved you so much. I still do. I loved you and your mother more than life itself, but when she died . . . the best parts of me died right along with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you had to go through that,\u201d she says with little emotion. \u201cI know you loved her. I remember. But knowing that doesn\u2019t make it any easier to find it in my heart to forgive you for what you did. I don\u2019t know why whatever is inside of you is so different from what\u2019s inside other people . . . to the point that you would allow yourself to do what you did to me. But despite the things you did to me, I know you love me. And as hard as it is to admit . . . I once loved you, too. I loved all the good parts of you.\u201d</p><p>She stands up and steps back. \u201cI know you aren\u2019t all bad. I know that. But if you love me like you say you do . . . if you loved my mother at all . . . then you\u2019ll do whatever you can to help me heal. You owe me that much. All I want is for you to be honest so I can leave here with some semblance of peace. That\u2019s all I\u2019m here for, okay? I just want peace.\u201d</p><p>Her father is crying now. She walks back to me and I can honestly say I\u2019m amazed by her right now. I\u2019m amazed by her resolve. Her strength. Her courage. I slide my hand down her arm until I find her pinky, and I hold it. She wraps her pinky tightly around mine in return.</p><p>Her father sighs heavily, then looks back up at her. \u201cWhen I first started drinking . . . it was only once. I did something to my little sister . . . but it was only one time. It was years before I met your mother.\u201d</p><p>She exhales a breath. \u201cWhat about after me? Have you done it to anyone else since I was taken?\u201d It\u2019s obvious he has by the guilt that consumes his features. \u201cWho?\u201d she asks. \u201cHow many?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head slightly. \u201cThere was just one more. I stopped drinking a few years ago and haven\u2019t touched anyone since. I swear. There were only three and they were at the lowest points of my life. When I\u2019m sober, I\u2019m able to control my urges. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t drink anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was she?\u201d Sky asks.</p><p>He nudges his head to the right, toward the house next door.</p><p>Toward the house I used to live in.</p><p>The house I lived in with Les.</p><p>I don\u2019t hear another word after that.</p><p>Chapter Forty-four</p><p>One would think that finding my sister\u2019s body was the worst thing that\u2019s ever happened to me.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t. The worst thing that ever happened to me came later that night, when I had to tell my mother her daughter was dead.</p><p>I remember pulling Les onto my lap, doing everything I could to make sense of what was happening. I tried to make sense of why she wasn\u2019t responding. Why she wasn\u2019t breathing or talking or laughing. It just didn\u2019t make sense that someone could be here one minute, then the very next minute they\u2019re not. They\u2019re just . . . not.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how long I held her. It could have been seconds. It could have been minutes. Hell, I was so out of it that it could have been hours. I just know that I was still holding her when the front door slammed shut downstairs.</p><p>I remember panicking, knowing what was about to happen. I was about to have to walk downstairs and look my mother in the eyes. I was about to have to tell her that her daughter was dead. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I don\u2019t know how I did it. I don\u2019t know how I let go of Les long enough to stand up. I don\u2019t know how I found the strength to even stand. When I made it to the top of the stairs, she and Brian were removing their jackets. He took hers and turned around to hang it on the coatrack. She glanced up at me and smiled, but then she stopped smiling.</p><p>I began to walk down the stairs toward her. My body was so weak, I was taking them slowly. One at a time. Watching her the whole way.</p><p>I don\u2019t know if she had mother\u2019s intuition or if she could just tell by the look on my face what had happened, but she started to shake her head and back away from me.</p><p>I started to cry and she started to panic and she continued to back away from me until her back met the front door. Brian was looking back and forth between us, not understanding at all what was going on.</p> <p>She turned around and gripped the doorframe, pressing her cheek against the door while she squeezed her eyes shut. It was like she was trying to shut me out. If she shut me out, she wouldn\u2019t have to face the truth.</p><p>Her body was racked with grief and she was crying so hard, there wasn\u2019t even a sound coming out of her mouth. I remember reaching the bottom step, watching her from where I was standing. Watching as she gave the word devastated a whole new meaning. I truly believed, at that point, that the word devastated should be reserved for mothers.</p><p>I no longer believe that.</p><p>The word devastated should be reserved for brothers, too.</p><p>\u201cLes,\u201d I whisper, turning away from Sky and her father. \u201cOh, God, no.\u201d I press my head against the doorframe and grip the back of my neck with both hands. I begin to cry so hard that I\u2019m not even able to make a sound. My chest hurts and my throat hurts, but my heart has just been completely obliterated.</p> <p>Sky comes up behind me. She wraps her arms around me and tries to comfort me in whatever way she can, but I can\u2019t feel it. I can\u2019t feel her and I can\u2019t feel the devastation anymore because all I feel is this overwhelming amount of hatred and rage. I\u2019m trying to refrain from lunging at him but I don\u2019t think I have enough self-control. I wrap my arm around Sky and pull her against me, hoping her presence can help calm me, but it doesn\u2019t. The only thing that could calm me would be knowing the man behind me is no longer breathing.</p><p>He\u2019s the reason. He\u2019s the reason for all of it.</p><p>He\u2019s why Les isn\u2019t here anymore. He\u2019s what broke Hope. He\u2019s the reason my mother knows the meaning of devastation. This bastard is who stole my sister\u2019s strength away from her, and I want him dead. But I want to be the one to do it.</p><p>I remove my arm from around Sky and push her away from me. I turn to face her father, but she steps between us, facing me with pleading eyes, pushing against my chest. She knows what I want to do to him and she\u2019s trying to push me out the door. I shove her out of the way because I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m capable of right now and I don\u2019t want her to get hurt.</p><p>I begin to step toward him, but he reaches behind the couch, then quickly turns and holds up a gun. I honestly wouldn\u2019t even care that he\u2019s holding a gun, but my protective instinct kicks in when I think about Sky, so I pause. He pulls the radio to his mouth with his free hand, keeping his gun trained on me the entire time he speaks into it.</p><p>\u201cOfficer down at thirty-five twenty-two Oak Street.\u201d</p> <p>His words immediately register in my head and I realize what he\u2019s about to do.</p><p>No.</p><p>No, no, no.</p><p>Not in front of Sky.</p><p>He turns his gun on himself, then looks at her. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Princess,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>I close my eyes and reach for her the second he fires the gun at himself. I cover her eyes and she begins to scream hysterically. She pulls my hand from her eyes, right when he falls to the floor, causing her to scream even louder.</p><p>I clamp my hand over her mouth and immediately pull her out the front door. She\u2019s too hysterical to carry right now, so I just drag her behind me.</p><p>The only thing running through my head at this point is how we need to get into the car. We need to get the hell out of here before anyone finds out we were ever here. Because if anyone finds out we were here, Sky\u2019s world will never be the same.</p> <p>When I reach the car I keep my hand clamped to her mouth and I press her back against her door, looking her hard in the eyes. \u201cStop,\u201d I tell her. \u201cI need you to stop screaming. Right now.\u201d</p><p>She nods vigorously, wide-eyed. \u201cDo you hear that?\u201d I say, trying to get her to understand the ramifications of what could happen if we don\u2019t leave right now. \u201cThose are sirens, Sky. They\u2019ll be here in less than a minute. I\u2019m removing my hand and I need you to get in the car and be as calm as you can because we need to get out of here.\u201d</p><p>She nods again so I remove my hand and quickly shove her into the car. I rush around to the driver\u2019s side and climb in, then crank the car and pull away. She leans forward in the seat and drops her head between her knees. She keeps saying, \u201cNo, no, no\u201d under her breath, all the way back to the hotel.</p><p>Chapter Forty-five</p><p>Once we\u2019re back inside our hotel room, I walk her to the bed. She\u2019s having one of her moments where she\u2019s completely zoned out and I don\u2019t do anything to bring her out of it. It\u2019s probably best if she stays like this for a while.</p><p>I pull off my shirt, which is now covered in blood. I remove my socks and shoes and jeans and toss them all aside. I walk to where Sky is still standing and I remove her jacket. There\u2019s blood all over her and I\u2019m trying to hurry so I can get her in the shower and wash it off. She finally turns to face me with a blank expression. I lay her jacket across the chair next to us, then lift her shirt over her head.</p><p>I reach down to the button on her jeans and undo it, then begin to lower them. When I reach her feet, she just stands still. I look up at her. \u201cI need you to step out of them, babe.\u201d</p><p>She looks down at me and places her hands on my shoulders while I pull the jeans off her, one foot at a time. I feel her reach to my hair and brush her fingers through it. I toss her jeans aside and look back up at her. She\u2019s shaking her head looking down at her hands, which are now moving frantically over her stomach. She\u2019s smearing her father\u2019s blood all over her stomach, attempting to wipe it off. She\u2019s gasping for breath, trying to scream, but nothing\u2019s coming out. I stand up and immediately pick her up, rushing her to the shower. I need to get this off her before she completely loses control.</p><p>I set her down in the shower and turn on the water. Once it\u2019s warm, I close the shower curtain and pull her wrists away from her stomach. I wrap her arms around me and pull her against my chest, then turn her to where she\u2019s standing under the stream of water.</p><p>As soon as the water splashes her face, she gasps and the clarity begins to return to her eyes.</p><p>I grab the soap and a washcloth, and rub them under the water, then turn and begin wiping the blood off her face.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d I whisper, staring her in the eyes. \u201cI\u2019m getting it off you, okay?\u201d</p><p>She squeezes her eyes shut and I diligently wash away every speck of blood from her face. When she\u2019s finally clean, I reach behind her in order to remove her ponytail holder.</p><p>\u201cLook at me, Sky,\u201d I say. She opens her eyes and I rest my hand reassuringly on her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m going to take off your bra now, okay? I need to wash your hair and I don\u2019t want to get anything on it.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes grow wide with my words and she pulls her arms through the straps of her bra, then frantically rips it over her head.</p><p>\u201cGet it out,\u201d she says quickly, referring to the blood in her hair. \u201cJust get it off me.\u201d</p><p>I take her wrists again and wrap her arms around me. \u201cI\u2019ll get it. Hold on to me and try to relax. I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>I pour the shampoo into my hands and bring it to her hair. I have to wash it several times before the water finally runs clean. Once I\u2019m finished washing her, I begin to wash my own hair. I get what I can but without being able to see myself, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve washed away everything. I don\u2019t want to ask her to help me do this, but I have to make sure it\u2019s all gone. \u201cSky, I need you to make sure I got it all, okay? I need you to wipe away anything I missed.\u201d</p><p>She nods and takes the washcloth out of my hands. She eyes my hair and my back and my shoulders, then finally rubs the washcloth over my ear.</p><p>She pulls the washcloth away from me and looks down at it, running it under the stream of water.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all gone,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>I take the washcloth and toss it onto the edge of the tub.</p><p>It\u2019s all gone, I repeat in my head.</p><p>I wrap my arms around her and close my eyes. I can feel it building. The questions. The memories. All the times I held Les at night while she cried and I had no idea what he\u2019d done to her. No idea what she\u2019d been through.</p><p>I hate him. I fucking hate that he got away with it for so long. He got away with what he did to Sky, to his sister, to Les. And the worst part is, he\u2019s not alive anymore for me to even be able to kill him.</p><p>Sky looks up at me and her eyes are full of sympathy. For a second I don\u2019t understand it, but then I realize I\u2019m crying . . . and that she\u2019s just as sad for me as I am for her. Her shoulders begin to shake and a sob breaks free. She slaps her hand over her mouth and squeezes her eyes shut.</p><p>I pull her against my chest and kiss the side of her head.</p><p>\u201cHolder, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she cries. \u201cOh, my God, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>I tighten my grip around her and press my cheek to the top of her head. I close my eyes and I cry. I cry for her. I cry for Les. I cry for myself.</p><p>She curls her arms up behind my shoulders, gripping me tightly, then she presses her lips against my neck. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she says quietly. \u201cHe never would have touched her if I . . .\u201d</p><p>I grab her by the arms and push her away from me so that I can look her in the eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare say that.\u201d I grab her face with both hands. \u201cI don\u2019t ever want you to apologize for a single thing that man did. Do you hear me? It\u2019s not your fault, Sky. Swear to me you will never let a thought like that consume you ever again.\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cI swear.\u201d</p><p>I continue to maintain eye contact with her, needing to know that she\u2019s telling me the truth. This girl has done nothing that warrants an apology and I never want her thinking like that again.</p><p>She throws her arms around my neck, tears falling from both of us now. We hold each other tightly. Desperately. She kisses my neck repeatedly, wanting to reassure me in the only way she knows how.</p><p>I lower my lips to her shoulder and kiss her in return. She holds me tighter and I let her. I let her hold me as tight as she possibly can. I continue to kiss her neck and she continues to kiss mine, both of us working our way toward each other\u2019s mouth. Before I reach her lips, I pull back and look into her eyes. She looks into mine and for once in my life, I can honestly say I\u2019ve found the only other person in this world who understands my guilt. The only person who understands my pain. The only person who accepts that it\u2019s who I am.</p><p>I used to think the best part of me died with Les, but the best part of me is standing right here in front of me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In one swift movement, I crash my lips to hers and grip her by the hair. I push her against the shower wall and kiss her with so much conviction, I know she could never for a second doubt how much I love her. I slide my hands down her thighs and lift her up until she wraps her legs around my waist.</p><p>I press myself against her and continue kissing her, wanting to feel her, rather than the pain that\u2019s trying to take over. I want nothing but to be a part of her right now and let everything else in our lives just fade away.</p><p>\u201cTell me this is okay,\u201d I say as I pull away from her mouth and search her eyes. \u201cTell me it\u2019s okay to want to be inside you right now . . . because after everything we\u2019ve been through today, it feels wrong to need you like I do.\u201d</p><p>She throws her arms around my neck and grasps my hair, pulling my mouth back to hers, showing me that she needs this just as much as I do. I groan and pull her away from the shower wall, then walk her out of the bathroom and into the bedroom. I drop her down onto the bed, then grab her panties and pull them down her legs. I crash against her mouth and pull off my boxers, which are now soaking wet. All I can think about is how much I need to be inside her right now. I pull apart from her long enough to get a condom on, then I grab her hips and pull her to the edge of the bed. I lift her leg to my side and slide my other arm underneath her shoulder.</p> <p>She looks up at me and I look down at her. I grip her leg and her shoulder and keep my eyes trained on hers, then push into her. The second I\u2019m inside her, it doesn\u2019t feel like enough. I press my lips to hers and try to search for whatever it is that\u2019s missing from the moment. I move in and out of her, more and more frantic with each thrust, trying desperately to reach a feeling that I don\u2019t even know exists. She relaxes her body against mine, following my movements, allowing me to be in control.</p><p>But I don\u2019t want that right now.</p><p>That\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with me.</p><p>My mind is so exhausted and so tired and my heart hurts so much right now. I just need her to help me figure out how to stop trying to be the hero for once.</p><p>I pull away from her and she looks up at me, never questioning why I\u2019ve drastically slowed against her. She just brings her hands to my face and gently runs her fingers over my eyes and my lips and cheeks. I turn my mouth toward the inside of her palm and I kiss it, then drop down on top of her, stopping completely. I keep my gaze locked with hers and I pull her to me, then lift her up as I stand. I\u2019m still inside her and she\u2019s wrapped around me, so I turn my back to the bed and slide down to the floor. I lean forward and kiss her bottom lip softly, then her whole mouth.</p> <p>I bring a hand to her cheek and drop the other to her hip. I begin to move beneath her, slowly guiding her with my hand, wanting her to just take control. I need her to want to comfort me the same way that I always want to comfort her.</p><p>\u201cYou know how I feel about you,\u201d I whisper, staring into her eyes. \u201cYou know how much I love you. You know I would do whatever I could to take away your pain, right?\u201d</p><p>She nods, never pulling her gaze from mine, even for a second.</p><p>\u201cI need that from you so fucking bad right now, Sky. I need to know you love me like that.\u201d</p><p>Her expression grows soft and her eyes fill with compassion. She laces our hands together and places them over our hearts. She strokes her thumb against my hand and lifts up slightly, then slowly glides back down me again.</p><p>The incredible sensation that rushes through my body causes my head to collapse against the mattress behind me. I groan, unable to keep my eyes open.</p> <p>\u201cOpen your eyes,\u201d she whispers, still moving against me. \u201cI want you to watch me.\u201d</p><p>I lift my head and watch her. It\u2019s the easiest thing I\u2019ve ever been asked to do, because she\u2019s fucking beautiful right now.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look away again,\u201d she says, lifting herself up. When she slides back onto my lap, I can barely keep my head up. Especially when that moan escapes her lips and she squeezes my hands even harder.</p><p>\u201cThe first time you kissed me?\u201d she says. \u201cThat moment when your lips touched mine? You stole a piece of my heart that night.\u201d</p><p>You stole a piece of mine, too.</p><p>\u201cThe first time you told me you lived me because you weren\u2019t ready to tell me you loved me yet? Those words stole another piece of my heart.\u201d</p><p>But I did love you. I loved you so much.</p><p>I open my hand and press it flat against her heart. \u201cThe night I found out I was Hope? I told you I wanted to be alone in my room. When I woke up and saw you in my bed I wanted to cry, Holder. I wanted to cry because I needed you there with me so bad. I knew in that moment that I was in love with you. I was in love with the way you loved me. When you wrapped your arms around me and held me, I knew that no matter what happened with my life, you were my home. You stole the biggest piece of my heart that night.\u201d</p> <p>I didn\u2019t steal it. You gave it to me.</p><p>She lowers her mouth to mine and I drop my head back against the mattress and let her kiss me. \u201cKeep them open,\u201d she whispers, pulling away from my lips. I do what she says and somehow open my eyes again, looking directly into hers. \u201cI want you to keep them open . . . because I need you to watch me give you the very last piece of my heart.\u201d</p><p>This moment. Right now. It\u2019s almost worth every ounce of pain I\u2019ve ever had to endure.</p><p>I tighten my grip on her hands and lean into her, but I don\u2019t kiss her. We get as close as we possibly can and we keep our eyes open until the very last second. Until she completely consumes me and I completely consume her and I have no idea where my love ends and hers begins.</p><p>As soon as I begin to tremble and moan beneath her, my head falls against the mattress and she allows me to close my eyes this time. She continues to move on top of me until I\u2019m completely and utterly still.</p><p>I give my heart a second to calm down, then I lift my head and look at her. I remove my hands from hers and I slide them through her hair to the back of her head. My lips connect with hers and I kiss her, pushing her off me and onto the floor beneath me. I slide my hand between us and flatten my palm against her stomach, then slowly lower my hand until I find the exact spot that makes my favorite sound escape her mouth. I drink in every single moan and breath that passes her lips. And I let her keep her eyes closed, but I keep mine open and watch her steal the very last piece of my heart.</p><p>Chapter Forty-six</p><p>Les,</p><p>I have so much I want to say, but I don\u2019t even know how to begin.</p><p>Everything with Sky couldn\u2019t have turned out better. She\u2019s back home with Karen now where she belongs.</p><p>I knew Karen wouldn\u2019t have harmed Sky. I could tell just from the little time I spent with them that Karen loved her as much as I did. It turns out, I was right. Karen took Sky from her father because Karen knew what he was doing to her. Karen was his sister . . . Sky\u2019s aunt. And she had been through every single thing that Sky went through. She took her because she couldn\u2019t just sit back and allow it to continue to happen. Now that Sky knows the whole truth, she\u2019s decided to stay with Karen. Karen risked her entire life for that girl. She risked her entire future and I could never thank her enough.</p><p>I said this to Sky and I\u2019ll say it to you. The only thing I wish Karen would have done differently, is I wish she could have taken you, too.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know, Les. I had no idea what he was doing to you and I\u2019m so sorry.</p><p>I\u2019ll tell you more tomorrow, but tonight I just needed to tell you that I love you.</p><p>Chapter Forty-seven</p><p>Happy Halloween. Sure hope you decide to wear something sexy for once.</p><p>I hit send and set the phone on my nightstand, then climb out of bed. I didn\u2019t leave Sky\u2019s house until after four o\u2019clock this morning, then I came home and wrote Les a note before I crawled into bed. It\u2019s been days of little sleep and high emotion.</p><p>I walk to the closet and grab a T-shirt, then pull it on over my head. My phone sounds off so I walk to it and pick it up to read her text.</p><p>Hi, Holder. It\u2019s Karen. Still haven\u2019t returned Sky\u2019s phone to her, but I\u2019ll relay the message. Or not.</p><p>Oh, shit. I laugh and text Karen back.</p><p>lol . . . sorry about that. But while I\u2019m texting you, how is she today?</p><p>I wait for her response, which doesn\u2019t take long.</p><p>She\u2019s okay. She\u2019s been through a lot and I know it\u2019ll take time. But she\u2019s the bravest girl I know, so I have complete faith in her.</p><p>I smile and text her back.</p><p>Yeah. She kind of reminds me of her mother.</p><p>She texts back a heart. I set my phone on the bed and sit down beside it. I pick it back up and scroll through it, finding my father\u2019s number.</p><p>Hey, Dad. Miss you. I\u2019m thinking about bringing my girlfriend to visit during Thanksgiving break. I want you to meet her. Tell Pamela I promise to stay off her couch.</p><p>I hit send, but I know the text wasn\u2019t enough, so I text him one more time.</p><p>And I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m really sorry.</p><p>I set the phone down and look across the room to the notebook still lying on the floor where I threw it. The one that contains the majority of my notes to Les.</p><p>I still don\u2019t want to read it, but I feel like I owe it to her. I stand up and walk to it. I bend over and pick it up at the same time I lower myself to the floor. I lean against the wall and pull my knees up, then open the notebook and flip to the back of it.</p><p>Chapter Forty-seven-and-a-half</p><p>Dear Holder,</p><p>If you\u2019re reading this, I\u2019m so, so sorry. Because if you\u2019re reading this, then I know what I did to you.</p><p>But I really hope you never find this letter. I\u2019m hoping whoever finds this notebook doesn\u2019t see much use for it and throws it out, because I don\u2019t want to break your heart. But I have so much I need to say to you that I\u2019ll never be able to tell you face to face, so I\u2019m doing it here, instead.</p><p>I\u2019m going to start with what happened when we were kids. With Hope.</p><p>I know how much you blamed yourself for walking away from her. But you need to realize that you weren\u2019t the only one, Holder. I walked away from her, too. And you were doing what any other child in that situation would do. You were trusting that the adults in her life were doing what was right for her. How could you have anticipated what was going to happen when she walked to that car? You couldn\u2019t have, so just stop thinking you could have done something differently. You couldn\u2019t have and frankly, you shouldn\u2019t have. Hope climbing into that car was the best thing that ever happened to her.</p><p>A few weeks after she was taken, her father asked me if I wanted to help him make some flyers. Of course I wanted to help him. I would have done anything that would have helped bring Hope back to us.</p><p>When I walked into his house, I could feel something wasn\u2019t right. He walked me to her bedroom. He told me the materials for the flyers were in Hope\u2019s room. Then he shut the door behind us and completely shattered my life.</p><p>It went on for years after that. It went on until the day I couldn\u2019t bear it anymore and finally told Mom..</p><p>She immediately went to the police. That same day I was interviewed by a therapist and my confession was documented. I was only nine or ten years old, so I don\u2019t remember a lot about it. I just remember that weeks went by and Mom and Dad had to go to the police station several times. The whole time all of this was going on, Hope\u2019s father never once returned home. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I found out later he had been arrested. An investigation was completed and it was even taken to court. I remember the day Mom came home and told me we were moving. Dad couldn\u2019t leave his job and she refused to keep us in Austin, so she moved us. I don\u2019t know if you know this, but they tried to work it out. Dad tried to find a job that could support us in our new town, but he never did. I think they eventually realized that it was easier being apart. Maybe they both blamed each other for what happened to me.</p><p>Now that I look back on all the therapy Mom had me undergo, I hate that she didn\u2019t see the need for her to see a therapist, too. I always wondered if their marriage could have been saved if they had talked to someone about it. But then again, I\u2019ve been in therapy for years and it obviously didn\u2019t save me. I wish it did, and maybe it could have if I knew how to apply it. It did help me get through for several years, but it couldn\u2019t save me from myself every time I had to close my eyes at night. And as much as Mom tried to save me, she couldn\u2019t do it, either. I wasn\u2019t looking to be saved.</p><p>I just wanted to be let go.</p><p>I found out several years later that Hope\u2019s father never had to pay for what he did to me. For what he did to Hope. He was extremely manipulative and made it seem like I was blaming him for Hope\u2019s disappearance and this was my way of getting back at him. The entire community rallied behind him. They couldn\u2019t believe someone would accuse a man of such a cruel act after having his daughter ripped out from under him.</p> <p>So he got away with it. He was free to do whatever he wanted and I felt like I was locked in hell for eternity.</p><p>Mom didn\u2019t want you to find out what happened to me. She was afraid of what it would do to you. We both saw how much you blamed yourself for what happened to Hope and she didn\u2019t want to see you hurt any more.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to see that, either.</p><p>Now comes the most difficult part of this letter. This is so hard for me to say, because I\u2019ve held so much guilt over it. Every day that I saw the pain in your eyes, I knew that if I just confessed to you what I\u2019m about to tell you, it would have relieved you of so much agony.</p><p>But I couldn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t find a way to tell you that Hope was alive. That she was okay and that Mom and I saw her once, about three years ago.</p> <p>I was fourteen and we were eating at a restaurant, just Mom and me. I was taking a drink when I looked up and saw her walking through the door.</p><p>I turned to Mom and I know I had to be as pale as a ghost, because she reached across the table and grabbed my hand.</p><p>\u201cLesslie, what\u2019s wrong, sweetie?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t talk. All I could do was stare at Hope. Mom turned around and the second she laid eyes on her, she knew it was her. We were both stunned silent.</p><p>The waitress led them to a table right next to ours. Mom and I were both just sitting there, staring at her. Hope glanced at me when she took her seat, then looked away like she didn\u2019t even recognize me. It broke my heart that she didn\u2019t recognize me. I think I started crying at that point. I was just so emotionally overwhelmed and I didn\u2019t know what to do. I fingered the bracelet on my wrist and whispered her name, just to see if she would hear me and turn around again.</p><p>She didn\u2019t hear me, but the woman who was with her did. She darted her head in our direction with sheer panic in her eyes. It confused me. It confused Mom.</p> <p>The woman looked at Hope. \u201cI think I left the stove on,\u201d she said, standing up. \u201cWe need to leave.\u201d Hope looked confused, but she stood up, too. Her mother ushered her toward the exit to the restaurant. That\u2019s when Mom stood up and rushed after them. I did, too.</p><p>When we were all outside, the woman rushed Hope to the car, then immediately shut her door. Mom and I walked up behind her and as soon as the woman turned around and faced Mom, tears welled in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d the woman begged. She didn\u2019t say anything after that. Mom stared at her for a while without saying anything in return. I just stood there, trying to understand what was happening.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you take her?\u201d Mom finally asked her.</p><p>The woman began to cry and she kept shaking her head. \u201cPlease,\u201d she cried. \u201cShe can\u2019t go back to him. Please don\u2019t do that to her. Please, please, please.\u201d</p><p>My mother nodded. She stepped forward and placed a reassuring hand on the woman\u2019s shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Mom said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d Mom glanced at me and tears filled her eyes, then she glanced back to the woman. \u201cI would do whatever it took to keep my daughter safe, too.\u201d</p><p>The woman looked at Mom in confusion. I know she didn\u2019t understand exactly just how much Mom knew, but she understood Mom\u2019s honesty. She tilted her head and exhaled. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said, backing away from us. \u201cThank you.\u201d She opened her door and climbed into her car, then they drove away.</p><p>I don\u2019t know where she lives. We never found out the woman\u2019s name and we never found out the name Hope goes by now. I also stopped wearing the bracelet after that day because I knew in my heart that she didn\u2019t need to be found. But I needed you to know, Holder. I just need you to know that she\u2019s alive and she\u2019s okay and you walking away from her that day was the best thing you could have done for her.</p> <p>As far as me, well . . . I\u2019m a lost cause. I\u2019ve spent the last eight or so years existing in this constant nightmare and I\u2019m just tired. The therapy and medication help numb the pain, but it\u2019s the numbness I don\u2019t want to endure, Holder. That\u2019s why I plan to do what I need to do, and that\u2019s what led to your reading this letter. I\u2019m tired and exhausted and sick of living a life that I don\u2019t really want to live anymore. I\u2019m tired of pretending to be happy for you, because I\u2019m not happy. Every single time I smile, I feel like I\u2019m lying to you, but I don\u2019t know how to live any other way. And I know when I do it, it\u2019ll break your heart. I know it\u2019ll devastate Mom and Dad. And I know that you\u2019ll hate me.</p><p>But knowing all of that can\u2019t change my mind. I\u2019ve lost the ability to care anymore, so it\u2019s hard to empathize with what you\u2019ll experience after I\u2019m gone. I don\u2019t remember what it\u2019s like to care enough about life that the thought of death could destroy me. So I need you to know that I\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t help it.</p><p>I\u2019ve been let down by this life one too many times and quite frankly, I\u2019m tired of losing hope.</p><p>I love you more than you know.</p><p>Les</p><p>P.S. I hope you never allow yourself to believe I went through with it because you failed me in some way. All those nights you held me and just let me cry . . . you have no idea how many times you\u2019ve already saved me.</p><p>Chapter Forty-eight</p><p>I drop the notebook onto the floor.</p><p>And I cry.</p><p>Chapter Forty-nine</p><p>I walk into my mother\u2019s office and she\u2019s on the phone. She looks up as I shut her door behind me. I walk to her desk and pull the receiver from her ear and hang it up.</p><p>\u201cYou know?\u201d I ask her. \u201cYou know about what that bastard did to Les?\u201d I wipe my eyes with the back of my hand, just as she stands up and her own eyes fill with tears. \u201cYou know what he did to Hope? And you know that Hope is alive and that she\u2019s fine? You know everything?\u201d</p><p>My mother is shaking her head and fear is filling her eyes. She can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m mad or if I\u2019ve lost it or if I\u2019m about to flip out.</p><p>\u201cHolder . . .\u201d she says. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t tell you. I knew what it would do to you if you knew something like that happened to your sister.\u201d</p><p>I collapse into a chair, unable to stand up for another second. She walks around the desk and kneels in front of me. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Holder. Please don\u2019t hate me. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s crying, looking at me with so much regret and apology. I immediately find the strength to stand back up and I pull her up with me. \u201cGod, no,\u201d I say to her, throwing my arms around her neck. \u201cMom, I\u2019m so glad you know. I\u2019m so relieved Les had you through all of that. And Hope?\u201d I push her away from me and look her in the eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s Sky, Mom. Hope is Sky and Sky is okay and I love her. I love her so much and I had no idea how to tell you because I was so scared you would recognize her.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes grow wide and she backs away from me, falling back into her chair. \u201cYour girlfriend? Your girlfriend is Hope?\u201d</p><p>I nod, knowing none of this is making any sense to her. \u201cRemember when I met Sky at the store a few months ago? I recognized her. I thought she was Hope, but then I thought maybe she wasn\u2019t. Then I fucking fell in love with her, Mom. I can\u2019t even begin to tell you the shit we\u2019ve been through this week.\u201d I\u2019m talking faster than she can probably comprehend. I sit in the chair across from her and pull it closer to her, then lean forward and take her by the hands. \u201cShe\u2019s okay. I\u2019m okay. I\u2019m more than okay. And I know you did your best for Les, Mom. I hope you know that, too. You did everything you could, but sometimes even all the love in the world from mothers and brothers isn\u2019t enough to help pull someone out of their nightmare. We just need to accept that things are what they are, and all the guilt and regret in the world can\u2019t change that.\u201d</p><p>She begins to sob. I wrap my arms around her and I hold her.</p><p>Chapter Forty-nine-and-a-half</p><p>Sky and I took the last two days of the week off school. We figured we already missed three days, what\u2019s two more? Besides, Karen wanted to keep a close eye on Sky all week. She\u2019s concerned about how everything is affecting her.</p><p>I agreed to give Sky space for a few days, but what Karen doesn\u2019t realize is that Sky\u2019s window still sees regular traffic in the middle of the night. All from me.</p><p>I\u2019ve spent the last few days in deep discussions with Mom. She wanted to know everything I knew about Les and Hope and of course she wanted to know what happened last weekend in Austin. Then she wanted to know all about my relationship with Sky, so I brought her up to date. Then she said she wanted to meet her.</p><p>So here we are. Sky just walked through the front door and my mom has her arms around her. She started crying almost immediately, which in turn made Sky tear up a little. Now they\u2019re standing in the foyer and my mother won\u2019t let go of her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to interrupt this homecoming,\u201d I say. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t let her go, Mom, you might scare her away.\u201d</p><p>My mother laughs and sniffles, pulling away from Sky. \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d she says, smiling at Sky. She turns to me. \u201cShe\u2019s beautiful, Holder.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cYeah, she\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>Sky laughs and hits me on the arm. \u201cRemember? The insults are only funny in text form.\u201d</p><p>I grab her and pull her to me. \u201cYou\u2019re not beautiful, Sky,\u201d I whisper in her ear. \u201cYou\u2019re incredible.\u201d</p><p>She wraps her arms around me in return. \u201cYou\u2019re not so bad, yourself,\u201d she says.</p><p>My mother takes her by the hand and pulls her away from me and into the living room, then she begins to bombard her with questions. I appreciate it, though, because she doesn\u2019t ask her questions about her situation or her past. She just asks normal questions about what she wants to major in when she goes to college and where she\u2019s planning to go to college. I leave them both in the living room to continue their conversation while I walk to the garage and grab a few boxes. Mom and I have talked about clearing out Les\u2019s room before. Now that I have Sky here, I think I\u2019ll actually be able to do it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I walk back to the living room and hand them each a box. \u201cCome on,\u201d I say, heading toward the stairs. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a room to clean.\u201d</p><p>We spend the rest of the afternoon cleaning out Les\u2019s room. We box her pictures and anything that meant something to her in one box, then we put all her clothes in boxes to take to Goodwill. I take both notebooks and I wrap them in the pair of jeans that have been on the floor for over a year and I place it all in a box. A box I keep.</p><p>After the room is finished, my mother and Sky head downstairs. I stack the boxes in the hallway, then turn to shut the door. Before I close it completely, I look to her bed. I don\u2019t watch her die again. I watch her smile.</p><p>Chapter Forty-nine-and-three-quarters</p> <p>\u201cI thought she said she wasn\u2019t going this weekend,\u201d I say to Sky as we walk through her front door.</p><p>\u201cI begged her to go. She\u2019s been stuck to me like glue for days now and I told her if she didn\u2019t go do her flea market thing, I\u2019d run away.\u201d</p><p>We make our way to Sky\u2019s bedroom and I close the door behind us. \u201cSo does that mean I can get you pregnant tonight?\u201d</p><p>She turns around and faces me, then shrugs. \u201cI guess we could practice,\u201d she says, smiling.</p><p>And we do. We practice at least three different times before midnight.</p> <p>We\u2019re lying on her bed, tangled together beneath her sheet. She\u2019s holding up our hands, which are clasped between us, and she\u2019s staring at them. \u201cI remember, you know,\u201d she says softly.</p><p>I tilt my head until it meets hers on the pillow. \u201cYou remember what?\u201d</p><p>She pulls her fingers away, then she wraps her pinky around mine. \u201cThis,\u201d she whispers. \u201cI remember the first time you held my hand like this. And I remember everything you said to me that night.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes and inhale a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cNot long after Karen brought me here, she asked me to forget my old name and all the bad that went along with it. So I thought about you . . . and I told her I wanted to be called Sky.\u201d</p><p>She lifts up onto her elbow and looks down at me. \u201cYou were always there, you know. Even when I couldn\u2019t remember . . . you were always there.\u201d</p> <p>I push her hair behind her ear and kiss her, then pull back. \u201cI love you so much, Sky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too, Holder.\u201d</p><p>I pull my arm out from under her and roll her onto her back, looking down at her. \u201cWill you do me a favor?\u201d</p><p>She nods.</p><p>\u201cFrom now on, I want you to call me Dean.\u201d</p><p>Final Chapter</p><p>Les,</p><p>It\u2019s been a while. I came across these letters today after needing boxes to pack for college. I also came across the pair of jeans that sat in your bedroom floor for over a year. I just threw them in the hamper for you. You\u2019re welcome.</p> <p>So . . . yeah. College. Me. Me going to college. Pretty cool, huh?</p><p>It\u2019s still about a month away before I go, but Sky has already been there for a couple of months. She had all her credits from being homeschooled, so right after high school graduation she left to get a head start on me.</p><p>She\u2019s so competitive.</p><p>But I\u2019m not worried, because I plan on surpassing her once I get there. I have this elaborate evil plan all mapped out. Every time I catch her studying or doing homework, I\u2019ll just whisper something sexy in her ear or flash my dimples. Then she\u2019ll get all flustered and sidetracked and she\u2019ll fall behind on her schoolwork and she\u2019ll fail her classes and I\u2019ll get my degree first and victory will be mine!</p><p>Or I\u2019ll just let her win. I sort of like letting her win sometimes.</p><p>I miss her like crazy, but we\u2019ll be in the same town again in less than a month.</p><p>A town with no parents.</p><p>A town with no curfews.</p><p>And if I have anything to do with it, she\u2019ll have a closetful of nothing but dresses.</p><p>Shit. Now that I look at it, I think we both might end up failing.</p><p>A lot has happened since I last wrote to you, but then again nothing has happened. Compared to the first few months following my return from living with Dad in Austin, the rest of the year has been pretty tame. Once Sky found out the truth, Karen eased up on the technology restrictions. I got her an iPhone for her real birthday and she has a laptop now, so we get to see each other every night through Skype.</p><p>I love Skype. A lot. Just sayin\u2019.</p><p>Mom and Dad are good. Dad didn\u2019t put two and two together when he met Sky, which I didn\u2019t really think he would to begin with. He never really spent a lot of time around her when we were kids because he worked so much. He does love her, though. And Mom? Good lord, Les. Mom can\u2019t get enough of her. It kind of weirds me out how close they\u2019ve become, but it\u2019s also good. It\u2019s good for Mom. I think having Sky as part of the family now has helped relieve some of the grief she still feels from your death.</p><p>And yes, we all still feel it. Everyone who loved you still feels it. And while I don\u2019t really relive your death anymore, I still miss you like hell. I miss you so much. Especially when something happens that I know you would think was funny. I catch myself laughing and then all of a sudden I realize I\u2019m the only one laughing and it hits me that I was expecting you to laugh, too. I miss your laugh.</p><p>I could go on and on about all the things I miss about you to the point that I start to feel sorry for myself again. But I\u2019ve learned over the past year what it really means to be able to miss someone. In order to miss someone, that means you were privileged enough to have them in your life to begin with.</p><p>And while seventeen years doesn\u2019t seem like near enough time to have spent with you over the course of a lifetime, it\u2019s still seventeen more years than the people that never knew you at all. So if I look at it that way . . . I\u2019m pretty damn lucky.</p><p>I\u2019m the luckiest brother ever in the whole wide world.</p><p>I\u2019m gonna go live my life now, Les. A life I\u2019m actually able to look forward to, and I honestly thought I\u2019d never be able to say that. Then again, I honestly thought I\u2019d always be hopeless, but I find hope every single day.</p><p>And sometimes I find her at night, too . . . on Skype.</p><p>I love you.</p><p>Dean </p> </body></html>"]
