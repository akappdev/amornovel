If we allow it to, the numbness can drown out everything, even the spark of life inside us. And eventually the person we once were is nothing but a vanishing memory.</p><p>I didn\u2019t always use to think this way. I used to have hope. I used to believe in things. Like when my father told me if I wanted something bad enough that I could make it happen.</p> <p>\u201cNo one else in the world can make things happen for you, Nova,\u201d he\u2019d said while we were lying on our backs on the hill in our backyard, staring up at the stars. I was six and happy and a little na\u00efve, eating his words up like handfuls of sugar. \u201cBut if you want something bad enough and are willing to work hard at it, then anything\u2019s possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything?\u201d I\u2019d said, turning my head toward him. \u201cEven if I want to be a princess?\u201d</p><p>He smiled, looking genuinely happy. \u201cEven a princess.\u201d</p><p>I grinned, looking up at the sky, thinking how wonderful it would be to wear a diamond tiara on my head and a sparkly pink dress and matching heels. I would spin around in circles and laugh as my dress spun with me. Never once did I think about what it truly meant to be a princess and how impossible it was for me to actually become one.</p><p>\u201cEarth to Nova.\u201d My boyfriend, Landon Evans, waves his hand in front of my face.</p> <p>I blink my gaze away from the stars and angle my head sideways along the bottom of the grassy hill in his backyard, looking him in the eyes. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>He laughs at me, but his smile looks unnatural, like it doesn\u2019t belong there. But that\u2019s normal for Landon. He\u2019s an artist, and he tells me that in order to portray pain in his portraits he has to carry it within him all the time. \u201cYou were totally spacing off on me there.\u201d The front porch light is on, and the fluorescent glow makes his honey-brown eyes look like the charcoal he uses for his sketchings.</p><p>I roll on my side and tuck my hands underneath my head, so I can really look at him. \u201cSorry, I was just thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have that look on your face, like you\u2019re thinking deep.\u201d He rotates on his hip and props his elbow up on the ground, resting his head against his palm. Wisps of his inky-black hair fall into his eyes. \u201cWant to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t really feel like talking.\u201d</p><p>He offers me a trivial but genuine smile, and the sadness in my mind fleetingly dissolves. It\u2019s one of the things that I love about Landon. He\u2019s the only person on this planet who can make me smile\u2014except for my dad, but he\u2019s no longer alive anymore, so smiles are rare in my book.</p> <p>Landon and I were best friends up until about six months ago, and maybe that\u2019s why he can make me happy. We got to bond on a deeper level and understand each other before all the kissing and hormones came along. I know we\u2019re only eighteen and haven\u2019t even graduated high school yet, but sometimes, when I\u2019m alone in my room, I can picture him and me together years ahead, in love, maybe getting married. It\u2019s surprising because for a long time after my dad died, I couldn\u2019t picture my future\u2014I didn\u2019t want to. But things change. People evolve. Move on. Grow as new people enter their lives.</p><p>\u201cI saw the picture you drew for the art project,\u201d I say, brushing some of the hair out of his eyes. \u201cIt was hanging up on Mr. Felmon\u2019s wall.\u201d</p><p>He frowns, which he always does whenever we\u2019re talking about his art. \u201cYeah, it didn\u2019t turn out how I planned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seemed like you were sad when you were drawing it,\u201d I tell him, lowering my hand to my hip. \u201cBut all your drawings do.\u201d</p><p>Any happiness in his expression withers as he rolls onto his back and pinpoints his attention to the star-cut sky. He\u2019s silent for a while and I turn onto my back, letting him be, knowing that he\u2019s stuck in his own head. Landon is one of the saddest people I\u2019ve met, and it\u2019s part of what drew me to him.</p><p>I was thirteen, and he\u2019d just moved in across the street from me. He was sitting against the tree in his front his yard, scribbling in a sketchbook, when I first saw him and decided to go over and introduce myself. It was right after my dad had died, and I\u2019d pretty much kept my distance from people. But with Landon, I don\u2019t know, there was just something about him.</p><p>I\u2019d crossed the street, very curious about what he was drawing. When I stopped in front of him, he glanced up at me, and I was taken aback by how much anguish was in his honey-brown eyes\u2014the torture and internal suffering. I\u2019d never seen so much of it in anyone my age before, and even though I didn\u2019t know what was causing it, I guessed we were going to be friends. He looked how I felt inside, like I\u2019d been broken apart and the pieces hadn\u2019t healed correctly. Just like I guessed, we did become best friends\u2014more than best friends, actually. We\u2019re almost inseparable, addicted to each other, and I absolutely hate being away from him because I feel lost and misplaced in the world whenever he\u2019s gone.</p><p>\u201cDo you ever get the feeling that we\u2019re all just lost?\u201d Landon utters, jerking me away from my thoughts again. \u201cJust roaming around the earth, waiting around to die.\u201d</p> <p>I bite on my lip, considering what he said as I find Cassiopeia in the sky. \u201cIs that what you really think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d he answers, and I turn my head, analyzing his perfect profile. \u201cI sometimes wonder, though, what the point of life is.\u201d He stops, and it feels like he\u2019s waiting for me to say something.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d I rack my brain for something else to add. But I can\u2019t think of a single coherent, reasonable response to his dark thoughts on the meaning of life, so I add, \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Nova,\u201d he promises without looking at me, then he reaches across the grass and grabs my hand, twining his fingers through mine. \u201cAnd I mean that, Nova, no matter what. I love you.\u201d</p><p>We get lost in the stillness of the night while we watch the stars glimmer and fade. It\u2019s peaceful but unsettling at the same time, because I can\u2019t turn my thoughts off. I worry about him when he gets depressed like this. It\u2019s like he goes into his own little world that\u2019s carved of gloomy thoughts and a blackened future, and I can\u2019t reach him no matter how hard I try.</p><p>We lie quietly, watching the stars and holding on to each other. Eventually, I drift to sleep with my face pressed against the cool grass, the spring breeze chilly against my skin, and Landon\u2019s fingers soothingly stroking the inside of my wrist. When I wake up again, all the stars have blended in with the grayness of morning, the moon is tucked away in the glow of daybreak, and the grass is damp with dew. The first thing I notice is that Landon\u2019s hand is missing from mine, and it makes me feel empty, like one of my arms has been detached from my body.</p><p>I sit up, rubbing my eyes then stretching my arms above my head as I glance around the backyard, searching for Landon. The only thing I can think of is that he got up to go to the bathroom, because he would never leave me sleeping on the hill alone in his backyard.</p><p>I push to my feet and brush the grass off the back of my legs before hiking up the hill toward his two-story house at the top of the backyard. It seems like a really long walk, because I\u2019m tired\u2014it\u2019s too early in the morning to be up. When I reach the back porch, I take my phone from my pocket to text Landon and see what he\u2019s doing. But I notice the back door is cracked, and I find myself walking inside, which is a little out of character for me. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m used to walking into his house without being let in. I always knock, even when he texts me and tells me to come straight up to his room.</p><p>But this time, something begs my feet to step over the threshold. It\u2019s cold inside the kitchen, and I wonder how long the back door has been open. Shivering, I wrap my arms around myself and cross the entryway to the kitchen. Landon\u2019s parents are asleep upstairs, so I make sure to walk quietly, heading downstairs to Landon\u2019s room, which is in the basement. The stairs creak underneath my shoes, and I hold my breath the entire way down, not sure what will happen if his parents wake up and catch me sneaking down to his room.</p><p>\u201cLandon,\u201d I whisper as I walk toward his bedroom. It\u2019s dark, except for the spark of the sunlight through the windows. \u201cAre you down here?\u201d</p><p>Silence is the only answer, and I almost turn around and go back upstairs. But then I hear the lyrics of an unknown song playing softly from somewhere in the house. I head for his bedroom door, and the music gets louder.</p><p>\u201cLandon,\u201d I say as I approach his closed door, my nerves bubbling inside me. I don\u2019t know why I feel nervous. Or maybe I do. Maybe I\u2019ve known for a long time, but I never wanted to accept it.</p><p>My hand trembles as I turn the knob. When I push the door open, every single word Landon\u2019s ever said to me suddenly makes sense to me. As the powerful lyrics playing from the stereo wrap around me, so does an undying chill. My hand falls lifeless to my side and I stand in the doorway, unblinking. I keep wishing for what I\u2019m seeing to go away, to disappear from my mind, to erase the memories. I wish and wish\u2014will it to happen\u2014telling myself that if I want it badly enough, it\u2019ll happen. I start to count backward, focusing on the pattern and rhythm of the numbers, and after a few minutes, numbness swallows my heart. Just like I wanted, my surroundings fade and I can\u2019t feel anything.</p><p>I fall to the floor, hitting it hard, but I can\u2019t feel the pain...</p><p>Quinton</p><p>I\u2019m driving way too fast. I know that and I know I should slow down, but everyone\u2019s complaining for me to hurry up and get them home. They\u2019re worried we\u2019re going to miss our curfew. Sometimes I wonder how I get myself into these kinds of messes. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s a big deal, but I\u2019d probably be having a lot more fun if I was wasted with the rest of them, because it\u2019s spring break and I should be having fun. I\u2019m not a fan of being the designated driver, but I usually end up offering to be one, and now I\u2019m stuck driving around a bunch of drunken idiots.</p><p>\u201cStop smoking in here.\u201d I roll down the window as smoke begins to fill up the car. \u201cMy mom will smell it from a mile away, and then she\u2019s not going to let me drive her car anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh come on, Quinton,\u201d my girlfriend, Lexi, pouts as she takes a deep drag off her cigarette, then extends her arm out the open window. \u201cWe\u2019ll air it out.\u201d</p><p>Shaking my head, I reach over with my free hand and snatch the cigarette from her. \u201cNo more smoking.\u201d I hold the cigarette out my cracked window until the cherry falls off, then release the rest out into the night. It\u2019s late, the road we\u2019re driving on is windy and curves around a lake, and we haven\u2019t seen a car in ages. It\u2019s good, though, since everyone else in the car is underage and drunk out of their minds.</p><p>Lexi sticks out her lip and crosses her arms over her chest, slumping back in her seat. \u201cYou\u2019re so boring when you\u2019re sober.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I press back a grin. We\u2019ve been dating for a couple of years now, and she\u2019s the only girl I\u2019ve ever been with and can ever see myself being with. I know it sounds superlame and cheesy because we\u2019re only eighteen, but I\u2019m seriously going to end up marrying her.</p><p>Still pouting, she slides her hand up my thigh until she reaches my cock, then she gives it a good rub. \u201cDoes that feel good? Because I\u2019ll keep doing it if you just let me smoke.\u201d</p><p>I try not to laugh at her, because she\u2019s wasted and it\u2019ll probably piss her off, but it\u2019s funny how annoyed she\u2019s getting by my soberness. \u201cAnd you\u2019re feisty and pouty when you\u2019re drunk.\u201d I squirm as she hits the right spot and fight not to shut my eyelids. \u201cBut I\u2019m still not going to let you smoke in the car.\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes, draws her hand away from me, and glances in the backseat, where my cousin Ryder is making out with some guy she met at the party. Their hands are all over each other. I\u2019m not a fan of hanging out with her, but she comes out to Seattle sometimes and stays with my grandma. Lexi and Ryder became best friends during one of her visits when they were about twelve, and they\u2019ve been inseparable ever since, which is pretty much how I met Lexi.</p> <p>When Lexi looks away, her nose is scrunched. \u201cSo gross.\u201d</p><p>I decelerate the car for a sharp corner in the road. \u201cOh, don\u2019t pretend like you don\u2019t wish it was you and me back there.\u201d I wink at her and she rolls her eyes. \u201cYou know you do.\u201d</p><p>She sighs and lets her arms fall to her lap. \u201cYeah, right. If we were back there and I was trying to stick my tongue down your throat, you\u2019d totally be like\u201d\u2014she makes air quotes\u2014\u201c \u2018Lexi, please, there are people in the front seat who can see us.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making me sound like an old man.\u201d I flash a playful grin at her as I downshift the car and the engine roars. The road is getting windier, and I have to slow down.</p><p>\u201cYou kind of are.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBullshit. I\u2019m fucking fun as hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re nice as hell, Quinton Carter. You\u2019re seriously like the nicest guy I know, but the most fun? I\u2019m not sure...\u201d A conniving look crosses her face as she taps her finger against her lip. \u201cHow about we find out?\u201d Without taking her eyes off me, she rolls the window down the rest of the way. The wind howls inside and blows her hair into her face.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Ryder says from the backseat, jerking her lips away from the guy\u2019s, and plucks strands of her hair out of her mouth. \u201cLexi, roll up the damn window. I\u2019m eating my own hair here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Mr. Fucking Fun as Hell,\u201d Lexi says, with her eyes on me as she arches her back and moves her head toward the window. \u201cLet\u2019s find out just how fun you are.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t like where she\u2019s going with this. She\u2019s too drunk, and even sober she\u2019s always been a daredevil, impulsive and a little bit reckless. \u201cLexi, what are you doing? Get in here. I don\u2019t want you to get hurt.\u201d</p><p>A lazy smile spreads across her lips as she sticks her head farther out the window. The pale glow of the moon hits her chest and makes her skin look ghostly against the darkness. \u201cI want to see just how fun you are, Quinton.\u201d She extends her arms above her head as she slides up onto the windowsill. \u201cI want to see how much you love me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cQuinton, make her stop,\u201d Ryder says, scooting forward in the seat. \u201cShe\u2019s going to hurt herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLexi, stop it,\u201d I warn, gripping onto the steering wheel with one hand and reaching for her with my other. \u201cI love you and that\u2019s why I need you to get down. Right now.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. I can\u2019t see her face or if she\u2019s not holding onto anything. I have no idea what the hell she\u2019s doing or thinking, and I\u2019m pretty sure she doesn\u2019t, either, and it\u2019s fucking terrifying.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re so fun, then just let me be free,\u201d she calls out. Her dress is blowing up over her legs and her feet are tucked down between the seat and the door.</p><p>Ryder lifts her leg to climb over into the front seat, but smacks her head on the roof and falls back. Shaking my head, I gently tap on the brakes as I lean over in the seat to grab Lexi. My fingers snag the bottom of Lexi\u2019s dress and that\u2019s when I hear the scream. Seconds later, the car is spinning out of control, and I don\u2019t know what\u2019s up or what\u2019s down. Shards of glass fly everywhere and cut at my arms and face as I try to hold onto Lexi\u2019s dress. But I feel the fabric leave my fingers as I\u2019m jarred to the side. Everyone is screaming and crying as metal crunches and bends. I see bright lights, feel the warmth of blood as something slashes through my chest.</p><p>\u201cQuinton...,\u201d I hear someone whisper, but I can\u2019t see who it is. I try to open my eyes, but it feels like they\u2019re already open, yet all I see is darkness.</p><p>But maybe that\u2019s better than seeing what\u2019s actually there...</p><p>Chapter 1</p> <p>Fifteen months later...</p><p>May 19, Day 1 of Summer Break</p><p>Nova</p><p>I have the web camera set up perfectly angled straight at my face. The green light on the screen is flickering insanely, like it can\u2019t wait for me to start recording. But I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019ll say or what the point of all this is, other than my film professor suggested it.</p><p>He\u2019d actually suggested to the entire class\u2014and probably all of his classes\u2014telling us that if we really wanted to get into filming, we should practice over the summer, even if we weren\u2019t enrolled in any summer classes. He said, \u201cA true videographer loves looking at the world through an alternative eye, and he loves to record how he sees things in a different light.\u201d He was quoting straight out of a textbook, like most of my professors do, but for some reason something about what he said struck a nerve.</p><p>Maybe it was because of the video Landon made right before the last seconds of his life. I\u2019ve never actually watched his video, though. I never really wanted to and I can\u2019t, anyway. I\u2019m too afraid of what I\u2019ll see or what I won\u2019t see. Or maybe it\u2019s because seeing him like that means finally accepting that he\u2019s gone. Forever.</p><p>I originally signed up for the film class because I waited too long to enroll for classes and I needed one more elective. I\u2019m a general major and don\u2019t really have a determined interest path, and the only classes that weren\u2019t full were Intro to Video Design or Intro to Theater. At least with the video class I\u2019d be behind a lens instead of standing up in front of everyone where they could strip me down and evaluate me. With video, I get to do the evaluating. Turns out, though, that I liked the class, and I found out that there\u2019s something fascinating about seeing the world through a lens, like I could be looking at it from anyone\u2019s point of view and maybe see things at a different angle, like Landon did during his last few moments alive. So I decided that I would try to make some videos this summer, to get some insight on myself, Landon, and maybe life.</p><p>I turn on \u201cJesus Christ\u201d by Brand New and let it play in the background. I shove the stack of psychology books off the computer chair and onto the floor, clearing off a place for me to sit. I\u2019ve been collecting the books for the last year, trying to learn about the human psyche\u2014Landon\u2019s psyche\u2014but books hold just words on pages, not thoughts in his head.</p><p>I sit down on the swivel chair and clear my throat. I have no makeup on. The sun is descending behind the mountains, but I refuse to turn the bedroom light on. Without the light the screen is dark, and I look like a shadow on a backdrop. But it\u2019s perfect. Just how I want it. I tap the cursor and the green light shifts to red. I open my mouth, ready to speak, but then I freeze up. I\u2019ve never been one for being on camera or in pictures. I\u2019d liked being behind the scenes, and now I\u2019m purposely throwing myself into the spotlight.</p><p>\u201cPeople say that time heals all wounds, and maybe they\u2019re right.\u201d I keep my eyes on the computer screen, watching my lips move. \u201cBut what if the wounds don\u2019t heal correctly, like when cuts leave behind nasty scars, or when broken bones mend together, but aren\u2019t as smooth anymore?\u201d I glance at my arm, my brows furrowing as I touch the scar along the uneven section of skin with my fingertip. \u201cDoes it mean they\u2019re really healed? Or is that the body did what it could to fix what broke...\u201d I trail off, counting backward from ten, gathering my thoughts. \u201cBut what exactly broke... with me... with him... I\u2019m not sure, but it feels like I need to find out... somehow... about him... about myself... but how the fuck do I find out about him when the only person that truly knew what was real is... gone?\u201d I blink and then click the screen off, and it goes black.</p><p>May 27, Day 7 of Summer Break</p><p>I started this ritual when I got to college. I wake up and count the seconds it takes for the sun to rise over the hill. It\u2019s my way of preparing for another day I don\u2019t want to prepare for, knowing that it\u2019s another day to add to my list of days I\u2019ve lived without Landon.</p><p>This morning worked a little differently, though. I\u2019m home for my first summer break of college, and instead of the hills that surround Idaho, the sun advances over the immense Wyoming mountains that enclose Maple Grove, the small town I grew up in. The change makes it difficult to get out of bed, because it\u2019s unfamiliar and breaks the routine I set up over the last eight months. And that routine was what kept me intact. Before it, I was a mess, unstable, out of control. I had no control. And I need control, otherwise I end up on the bathroom floor with a razor in my hand with the need to understand why he did it\u2014what pushed him to that point. But the only way to do that is to make my veins run dry, and it turned out that I didn\u2019t have it in me. I was too weak, or maybe it was too strong. I honestly don\u2019t know anymore, what\u2019s considered weak and what\u2019s considered strong. What\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong. Who I was and who I should be.</p><p>I\u2019ve been home for a week, and my mom and stepfather are watching me like hawks, like they expect me to break down again, after almost a year. But I\u2019m in control now. In control.</p><p>After I get out of bed and take a shower, I sit for exactly five minutes in front of my computer, staring at the file folder that holds the video clip Landon made before he died. I always give myself five minutes to look at it, not because I\u2019m planning on opening it, but because it recorded his last few minutes, captured him, his thoughts, his words, his face. It feels like the last piece of him that I have left. I wonder if one day, somehow, I\u2019ll finally be able to open it. But at this moment, in the state of mind I\u2019m stuck in, it just doesn\u2019t seem possible. Not much does.</p><p>Once the five minutes are over, I put on my swimsuit, then pull on a floral sundress over it and strap some leather bands onto my wrists. Then I pull the curtains shut, so Landon\u2019s house will be out of sight and out of mind, before heading back to my computer desk to record a short clip.</p><p>I click Record and stare at the screen as I take a few collected breaths. \u201cSo I was thinking about my last recording\u2014my first\u2014and I was trying to figure out what the point of this is\u2014or if there even had to be a point. \u201cI rest my arms on the desk and lean closer to the screen, assessing my blue eyes. \u201cI guess if there is a point, it would be for me to discover something. About myself or maybe about... him, because it feels like there\u2019s still so much stuff I\u2019m missing... so many unanswered questions and all the lack of answers leaves me feeling lost, not just about why the hell he did it, but about what kind of person I am that he could leave so easily... Who was I then? Who am I now? I really don\u2019t know... But maybe when I look back and watch these one day far, far down the road, I\u2019ll realize what I really think about life and I\u2019ll finally get some answers to what leaves me confused every single day, because right now I\u2019m about as lost as a damn bottle floating in gross, murky water.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I pause, contemplating as I tap my fingers on the desk. \u201cOr maybe I\u2019ll be able to backtrack through my thoughts and figure out why he did it.\u201d I inhale and then exhale loudly as my pulse begins to thrash. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re not me and you\u2019re watching these, then you\u2019re probably wondering who he is, but I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m ready to say his name yet. Hopefully I\u2019ll get there. One day\u2014someday, but who knows... maybe I\u2019ll always be as clueless and as lost as I am now.\u201d</p><p>I leave it at that and turn the computer off, wondering how long I\u2019m going to continue this pointless charade, this time filler, because right now that\u2019s how it feels. I shove the chair away and head out of my room. It takes fifteen steps to reach the end of the hall, then another ten to get me to the table. They\u2019re each taken at a consistent pace and with even lengths. If I were filming right now, my steps would be smooth and perfect, steady as a rock.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, my beautiful girl,\u201d my mother singsongs as she whisks around the kitchen, moving from the stove to the fridge, then to the cupboard. She\u2019s making cookies, and the air smells like cinnamon and nutmeg, and it reminds me of my childhood when my dad and I would sit at the table, waiting to stuff our mouths with sugar. But he\u2019s not here anymore and instead Daniel, my stepfather, is sitting at the table. He\u2019s not waiting for the cookies. In fact he hates sugar and loves healthy food, mostly eating stuff that looks like rabbit food.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Nova. It\u2019s so good to have you back.\u201d He has on a suit and tie, and he\u2019s drinking grapefruit juice and eating dry toast. They\u2019ve been married for three years, and he\u2019s not a bad guy. He\u2019s always taken care of my mom and me, but he\u2019s very plain, orderly, and somewhat boring. He could never replace my dad\u2019s spontaneous, adventurous, down-to-earth personality.</p> <p>I plop down in the chair and rest my arms on the kitchen table. \u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>My mom takes a bowl out of the cupboard and turns to me with a worried look on her face. \u201cNova, sweetie, I want to make sure you\u2019re okay... with being home. We can get you into therapy here, if you need it, and you\u2019re still taking your medication, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes mom, I\u2019m still taking my medication,\u201d I reply with a sigh and lower my head onto my arms and shut my eyes. I\u2019ve been on antianxiety medication for a while now. I\u2019m not sure if it really does anything or not, but the therapist prescribed it to me so I take it. \u201cI take them every morning, but I stopped going to therapy back in December, because it doesn\u2019t do anything but waste time.\u201d Because no matter that, they always want me to talk about what I saw that morning\u2014what I did and why I did it\u2014and I can\u2019t even think about it, let only talk about it.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know, honey, but things are different when you\u2019re here,\u201d she says quietly.</p><p>I remember the hell I put her through before I left. The lack of sleep, the crying... cutting my wrist open. But that\u2019s in the past now. I don\u2019t cry as much, and my wrist has healed.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Mom.\u201d I open my eyes, sit back up, and overlap my fingers in front of me. \u201cSo please, pretty please, with a cherry on top and icing and candy corn, would you please stop asking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound just like your father... everything had to be referenced to sugar,\u201d she remarks with a frown as she sets the bowl down on the counter. In a lot of ways she looks like me: long brown hair, a thin frame, and a sprinkle of freckles on her nose. But her blue eyes are a lot brighter than mine, to the point where they almost sparkle. \u201cHoney, I know you keep saying that you\u2019re fine, but you look so sad... and I know you were doing okay at school, but you\u2019re back here now, and everything that happened is right across the street.\u201d She opens a drawer and selects a large wooden spoon, before bumping the drawer shut with her hip. \u201cI just don\u2019t want the memories to get to you now that you\u2019re home and so close to... everything.\u201d</p><p>I stare at my reflection in the stainless-steel microwave. It\u2019s not the clearest. In fact, my face looks a little distorted and warped, like I\u2019m looking into a funhouse mirror, my own face nearly a stranger. But if I tilt sideways just a little, I almost look normal, like my old self. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I repeat, observing how blank my expression looks when I say it. \u201cMemories are just memories.\u201d Really, it doesn\u2019t matter what they are, because I can\u2019t see the parts that I know will rip my heart back open: the last few steps leading up to Landon\u2019s finality and the soundless moments afterward, before I cracked apart. I worked hard to stitch my heart back up after it was torn open, even if I hadn\u2019t done it neatly.</p><p>\u201cNova.\u201d She sighs as she starts mixing the cookie batter. \u201cYou can\u2019t just try to forget without dealing with it first. It\u2019s unhealthy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgetting is dealing with it.\u201d I grab an apple from a basket on the table, no longer wanting to talk about it because it\u2019s in the past, where it belongs.</p><p>\u201cNova, honey,\u201d she says sadly. She\u2019s always tried to get me to talk about that day. But what she doesn\u2019t get is that I can\u2019t remember, even if I really tried, which I never will. It\u2019s like my brain\u2019s developed it\u2019s own brain and it won\u2019t allow those thoughts out, because once they\u2019re out, they\u2019re real. And I don\u2019t want them to be real\u2014I don\u2019t want to remember him like that. Or me.</p> <p>I push up from the chair, cutting her off. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to hang out next to the pool today, and Delilah will probably be over in a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want.\u201d My mom smiles halfheartedly at me, wanting to say more, but fearing what it\u2019ll do to me. I don\u2019t blame her, either. She\u2019s the one who found me on the bathroom floor, but she thinks it\u2019s more than it was. I was just trying to find out what he felt like\u2014what was going on inside of him when he decided to go through with it.</p><p>I nod, grab a can of soda out of the fridge, and give her a hug before I head for the sliding glass door. \u201cThat\u2019s what I want.\u201d</p><p>She swallows hard, looking like she might cry because she thinks she\u2019s lost her daughter. \u201cWell, if you need me, I\u2019m here.\u201d She turns back to her bowl.</p><p>She\u2019s been saying that to me since I was thirteen, ever since I watched my dad die. I\u2019ve never taken her up on the offer, even though we\u2019ve always had a good relationship. Talking about death with her\u2014at all\u2014doesn\u2019t work for me. At this point in my life, I couldn\u2019t talk to her about it even if I wanted to. I have my silence now, which is my healing, my escape, my sanctuary. Without it, I\u2019d hear the noises of that morning, see the bleeding images, and feel the crushing pain connected to them. If I saw them, then I\u2019d finally have to accept that Landon\u2019s gone.</p><p>I don\u2019t like unknown places. They make me anxious and I have trouble thinking\u2014breathing. One of the therapists I first saw diagnosed me with obsessive-compulsive disorder. I\u2019m not sure if he was right, though, because he moved out of town not too long after. I was left with a therapist in training, so to speak, and he decided that I was just depressed and had anxiety, hence the antianxiety medication for the last year and three months.</p><p>The unfamiliarity of the backyard disrupts my counting, and it takes me forever to get to the pool. By the time I arrive at the lawn chair, I know how many steps it took me to get here, how many seconds it took me to sit down, and how many more seconds it took for Delilah to arrive and then take a seat beside me. I know how many rocks are on the path leading to the porch\u2014twenty-two\u2014how many branches are on the tree shielding the sunlight from us\u2014seventy-eight. The only thing I don\u2019t know is how many seconds, hours, years, decades, it will take before I can let go of the goddamn self-induced numbness. Until then I\u2019ll count, focus on numbers instead of the feelings always floating inside me, the ones linked to images immersed just beneath the surface.</p><p>Delilah and I lie in lawn chairs in the middle of my backyard with the pool behind us and the sun bearing down on us as we tan in our swimsuits. She\u2019s been my best friend for the past year or so. Our sudden friendship was strange, because we\u2019d gone to high school together but never really talked. She and I were in different social circles and I had Landon. But after it happened... after he died... I had no one, and the last few weeks of high school were torture. Then I met her, and she was nice and she didn\u2019t look at me like I was about to shatter. We hit it off, and honestly, I have no idea what I\u2019d do without her now. She\u2019s been there for me, she shows me how to have fun, and she reminds me that life still exists in the world, even if it\u2019s brief.</p> <p>\u201cGood God, has it always been this hot here?\u201d Delilah fans her face with her hand as she yawns. \u201cI remember it being colder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d I pick up a cup of iced tea on the table between us and prop up on my elbow to take a sip. \u201cWe could go in,\u201d I suggest, setting my glass down. I turn it in a circle until it\u2019s perfectly in place on the condensation ring it left behind, and then I wipe the moisture from my lips with the back of my hand and rest my head back against the chair. \u201cWe do have air-conditioning.\u201d</p><p>Delilah laughs sardonically as she reaches for the sparkly pink flask in her bag. \u201cYeah, right. Are you kidding me?\u201d She pauses, examining her fiery red nails, then unscrews the lid off the flask. \u201cNo offense. I didn\u2019t mean for that to sound rude, but your mom and dad are a little overwhelming.\u201d She takes a swig from the flask and holds it out in my direction.</p><p>\u201cStepdad,\u201d I correct absentmindedly. I wrap my lips around the top of the flask and take a tiny swallow, then hand it back to her and close my eyes. \u201cAnd they\u2019re just lonely. I\u2019m the only child and I\u2019ve been gone for almost a year.\u201d</p><p>She laughs again, but it\u2019s breezier than before. \u201cThey\u2019re seriously the most overbearing parents I know. They call you every day at school and text you a thousand times.\u201d She puts the flask back into her bag.</p><p>\u201cThey just worry about me.\u201d They didn\u2019t use to. My mom was really carefree before my dad died, and then she got concerned about how his death and seeing it affected me. Then Landon died, and now all she does is constantly worry.</p><p>\u201cI worry about you, too,\u201d Delilah mumbles. She waits for me to say something, but I don\u2019t\u2014I can\u2019t. Delilah knows about what happened with Landon, but we never really talk about what I saw. And that\u2019s one of the things I like about her\u2014that she doesn\u2019t ask questions.</p><p>One... two... three... four... five... breathe... six... seven... eight... breathe... Balling my hands into fists, I fight to calm myself down, but the darkness is ascending inside me, and it will take me over if I let it and drag me down into the memory I won\u2019t remember; my last memory of Landon.</p><p>\u201cI have a brilliant idea,\u201d she interrupts my counting. \u201cWe could go check out Dylan and Tristan\u2019s new place.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My eyes open and I slant my head to the side. My hands are on my stomach, and I can feel my pulse beating through my fingertips, inconsistent. Tracking the beats is difficult, but I try anyway. \u201cYou want to go see your ex-boyfriend\u2019s place. Seriously?\u201d</p><p>Swinging her legs over the edge of the chair, Delilah sits up and slips her sunglasses up to the top of her head. \u201cWhat? I\u2019m totally curious what he ended up like.\u201d She presses her fingertips to the corners of her eyes, plucking out gobs of kohl eyeliner.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but isn\u2019t it kind of weird to show up randomly after not talking to him in like forever, especially after how bad your guys\u2019 breakup was,\u201d I say. \u201cI mean, if Tristan hadn\u2019t stepped in, you would have probably hit Dylan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, probably, but that\u2019s all in the past.\u201d She chews on her thumbnail and gives me a guilt-ridden look as she smears the tanning-spray grease off her bare stomach. \u201cBesides that\u2019s not technically accurate. We kind of talked yesterday.\u201d</p> <p>Frowning, I sit up and refasten the elastic around my long, wavy brown hair, securing it in a ponytail. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d I ask, and when she doesn\u2019t respond, I add, \u201cNine months ago, when he cheated on you, you swore up and down that you\u2019d never talk to that\u201d\u2014I make air quotes\u2014\u201c \u2018fucking, lying, cheating bastard\u2019 again. In fact, if I remember right, it was the main reason you decided to go to college with me\u2014because you needed a break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I say that really?\u201d She feigns forgetfulness as she taps her finger on her chin. \u201cWell, like everything else in my life, I\u2019ve decided to have a change of heart.\u201d She reaches for the tanning spray on the table between us. \u201cAnd besides, I did need a break, not just from him, but from my mom and this town, but now we\u2019re back and I figure I might as well have some fun while I\u2019m here. College wore me out.\u201d</p><p>Delilah is the most indecisive person I\u2019ve ever met. During our freshman year, she changed majors three times, dyed her hair from red, to black, then back to red again, and went through about a half a dozen boyfriends. I secretly love it, despite how much I pretend that I don\u2019t. It was what kind of drew me to her; her uncaring, nonchalant attitude, and the way she could forget things in the snap of a finger. I wish I could be the same way sometimes, and if I hang around her a lot, there are a few moments when I can get my mind on the same carefree level as hers.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you two been talking about?\u201d I wonder, plucking a piece of grass off my leg. \u201cAnd please don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s getting back together, because I don\u2019t want to see you get crushed like that again.\u201d</p><p>Her smile shines as she tucks strands of her red hair behind her heavily studded ears, then she removes the lid from the tanning spray. \u201cWhat is with you and Dylan? He\u2019s always put you on edge.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s sketchy. And he cheated on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not sketchy... he\u2019s mysterious. And he was drunk when he cheated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDelilah, you deserve better than that.\u201d</p><p>She narrows her eyes at me as she spritzes her legs with tanning spray. \u201cI\u2019m not better than him, Nova. I\u2019ve done supercrappy things, hurt people. I\u2019ve made mistakes\u2014we all have.\u201d</p><p>I stab my nails into the palms of my hands, thinking of all the mistakes I made and their consequences. \u201cYes, you are better. All he\u2019s ever done is cheat on you and deal drugs.\u201d</p><p>She slaps her hand on her knee. \u201cHey, he doesn\u2019t deal anymore. He stopped dealing a year ago.\u201d She clicks the cap back onto the tanning spray and tosses it into her bag.</p> <p>I sigh, push my sunglasses up over my head, and massage my temples. \u201cSo what has he been up to for a year?\u201d I lower my hands and blink against the sunlight.</p><p>She shrugs, and then her lips expand to a grin as she grabs my hand and stands, tugging me to my feet. \u201cHow about we go change out of our swimsuits, head over to his place, and find out?\u201d When I open my mouth to protest, she adds, \u201cIt\u2019d be a good distraction for the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really looking for a distraction, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then you could go over and see Tristan.\u201d She bites back an amused smirk. \u201cMaybe reheat things.\u201d</p><p>I glare at her. \u201cWe hooked up one time and that\u2019s because I was drunk and...\u201d Vulnerable. I\u2019d actually been really drunk, and my thoughts had been all over the place because of an unexpected visit from Landon\u2019s parents that morning. They\u2019d wanted to give me some of his sketchings, which they\u2019d found in a trunk upstairs\u2014sketchings of me. I\u2019d barely been able to take them without crying, and then I\u2019d run off, looking to get drunk and forget about the drawings, Landon, and the pain of him leaving. Tristan, Dylan\u2019s best friend\u2014and roommate\u2014was the first guy I came across after way, way too many Coronas and shots. I started making out with him without even saying hello.</p><p>He was the first guy I\u2019d made out with since Landon, and I spent the entire night afterward crying and rocking on the bathroom floor, counting the cracks in the tile and trying to get myself to calm down and stop feeling guilty for kissing someone else, because Landon was gone and he took a part of me with him\u2014at least that was what it feels like. What\u2019s left of me is a hollow shell full of denial and tangled with confusion. I have no idea who I am anymore. I really don\u2019t. And I\u2019m not sure if I want to know or not.</p><p>\u201cOh come on, Nova.\u201d She releases my hand and claps her hands in front of her. \u201cPlease, can we just go and try to have some fun?\u201d</p><p>I sigh, defeated, and nod, knowing that the true feelings of why I don\u2019t want to go over there lie more in the fact that I hate new places than anything else. Unfamiliar situations put me on edge, because I hate the unknown. It reminds me just how much the unknown controls everything, and my counting can sometimes get a little out of hand. But I don\u2019t want to argue anymore with Delilah, either, because then my anxiety will get me worked up and the counting will, too. Either way, I know I\u2019m going to have a head full of numbers. At least if I go with Delilah, then I can keep an eye on her and maybe she\u2019ll end up happy. And really, that\u2019s all I can ask for. For everyone to be happy. But as I all too painfully know, you can\u2019t force someone to be happy, no matter how much you wish you could.</p> <p>Chapter 2</p><p>Quinton</p><p>I ask myself the same question every day: Why me? Why did I survive? And every day I get the same response: I don\u2019t know. Deep down, I know there really isn\u2019t an answer, yet I keep asking the same question, hoping that maybe one day someone will give me a hand and give me a clear answer. But my head is always foggy, and answers always come to me in harsh, jagged responses: regardless of why I survived, it was my fault, and I should be the one buried under the ground, locked in a box, below a marked stone. Two people died because of me that day. Two people I cared about. And even though the guy I barely know miraculously lived, he could have very easily died, and his death would have been my fault, too.</p><p>All my fault.</p><p>\u201cThanks for letting me stay here, man,\u201d I say for the thousandth time. I can tell my cousin Tristan is getting a little irritated by how many times I\u2019ve said it, but I can\u2019t seem to stop. I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t easy for him to help out the most hated member of our family. The one who destroyed lives and split apart a family. But I needed to leave, despite how much I didn\u2019t want to; something that became clear when my dad finally spoke to me after over a year of near silence.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s time for you to move out,\u201d he\u2019d said, eyeing my lazy ass sprawled out on the bed as music played in the background. I was sketching something that looked like an owl in a tree, but my vision was a little blurred, so I couldn\u2019t quite tell for sure. \u201cYou\u2019re nineteen years old and getting too old to live at home.\u201d</p><p>I was high out of my mind, and I had a hard time focusing on anything except how slow his lips were moving. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He studied me from the doorway and I could tell he was disappointed in what he saw. I was no longer his son, but a washed-up druggie who lay around all day wasting his life, ruining everything he\u2019d worked so hard to achieve. All that time spent in high school, getting good grades, winning art fairs, working hard to get scholarships, was exchanged for a new goal: getting high. He didn\u2019t try to understand why I needed drugs\u2014that without them, I\u2019d be worse off\u2014and I never wanted him to. It wasn\u2019t like we\u2019d had a good relationship before the accident. My mom had died in childbirth, and even though he never said it, I sometimes wonder if he blamed me for killing her when she brought me into this world.</p><p>Finally, he\u2019d left, and the conversation was over. The next morning, when my head had cleared a little, I realized I actually had to find a place to live in order to move out. I didn\u2019t have a job at the moment, due to the fact I failed a random drug test at the last job, and I had a bad track record of getting fired. Not knowing what else to do, I\u2019d called up Tristan. We used to be friends when we were younger... before everything happened... before I killed Ryder, his sister. I felt like a dick for calling him, but I remembered him being nice, and he even talked to me after the funeral, even though his parents no longer would. He seemed reluctant, but he agreed, and a couple of days later I packed up my shit, bought a ticket, and headed for my temporary new home.</p><p>\u201cDude, for the millionth time, you\u2019re good, so stop thanking me.\u201d Tristan picks up the last box out of the trunk of his car.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure, though?\u201d I ask again, because it never really seems like I can ask enough. \u201cI mean, with me staying here, especially after... everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you on the phone that I was.\u201d He shifts his weight, moving the box to his free arm, and then scratches the back of his neck uncomfortably. \u201cLook, I\u2019m good, okay? You can stay here until you can get your feet on the ground or whatever... I\u2019m not going to just let you live out on the streets. Ryder wouldn\u2019t have wanted that, either.\u201d He almost chokes on her name and then clears his throat a thousand times.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure I agree with him. Ryder and I were never that close, but I\u2019m not going to bring that up, considering things have already gotten really awkward and I\u2019ve only been here for like five minutes.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but what about your parents?\u201d I ask. His parents insist that the accident was my fault and that I should have been driving more safely. They told me that I ruined their family, killed their daughter.</p><p>\u201cWhat about them?\u201d His voice is a little tight.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t they be pissed when they find out I\u2019m living with you?\u201d</p><p>He slams the trunk down. \u201cHow are they going to find out? They never talk to me. In fact they\u2019ve pretty much disowned me and my lifestyle.\u201d I start to protest, but he cuts me off. \u201cLook, you\u2019re good. They never stop by. I barely talk to them. So can you please just chill out and enjoy your new home?\u201d He heads for the gate and I follow. \u201cI do have to say, though, that it probably would have been better if you drove out here. Now you\u2019re stranded if you want to go anywhere.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s better that way.\u201d I adjust the handle of the bag over my shoulder and we walk toward a single-wide trailer. The siding is falling off, one of the windows is covered with a piece of plywood, and the lawn is nonexistent; instead there\u2019s a layer of gravel, then a fence, followed by more gravel. It\u2019s a total crack house, but that\u2019s okay. This is the kind of place where I belong, in a place no one wants to admit exists, just like they don\u2019t want to admit I exist.</p><p>\u201cYou know there\u2019s no bus here, right?\u201d He steps onto the stairway, and it wobbles underneath his feet. \u201cIt\u2019s a freaking small-ass town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d I follow him with my thumb hitched under the handle of my bag. \u201cI\u2019ll just walk everywhere.\u201d</p><p>He laughs, shifting the box to one arm so he can open the screen door. \u201cOkay, if you say so.\u201d He steps inside the house, and I catch the screen door with my foot, grab the handle, and hold the door open as I maneuver my way inside.</p> <p>The first thing I notice is the smell; smoky but with a seasoned kick to it that burns the back of my throat. It\u2019s familiar, and suddenly I feel right at home. My eyes sweep the room and I spot the joint burning in the ashtray on a cracked coffee table.</p><p>Tristan drops the box on the floor, steps over it and strides up to the ashtray. \u201cYou good with this?\u201d He picks up the joint and pinches it in between his fingers. \u201cI can\u2019t remember if you\u2019re cool or not.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s not really a question. It\u2019s more of a warning that I have to be cool with it if I\u2019m going to live here. I let the handle of the bag slide down my arm and it falls to the floor. \u201cI used to not be.\u201d I used to care about things\u2014I used to think that doing the right thing would make me a good person. \u201cBut now I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows knit at my vague answer and I reach for the joint. As soon as it\u2019s in my hand and the poisonous yet intoxicating smoke starts to snake up to my face, I instantly feel at ease again. The calm only amplifies as I put it to my lips and take a deep drag. I trap it in my chest, allowing the smoke to burn at the back of my throat, saturate my lungs, and singe my heart away. It\u2019s what I want\u2014what I need\u2014because I don\u2019t deserve anything more. I part my lips and release the smoke into the already tainted air, feeling lighter than I have since I got on that god damn plane.</p><p>\u201cHoly fucking shit, look what the dog drug in.\u201d Dylan, Tristan\u2019s roommate, walks out from behind a curtain at the back of the room, laughing, and a blonde girl trails at his heels. I\u2019ve only met him a couple of times during the few visits my dad and I made to Maple Grove to visit Tristan\u2019s parents. He looks different\u2014rougher\u2014a shaved head, multiple tattoos on his arms, and he used to be a lot stockier, but I\u2019m guessing the weight loss is from the drugs.</p> <p>\u201cHi, Quinton.\u201d The blonde waves her hand, then winds around Dylan and moves toward me. She keeps her arms tight to her side, pressing them against her chest, so her tits nearly pop out of her top. She seems to know me, yet I have no fucking clue who she is. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m racking my brain for some sort of memory that has her in it, but the weed has totally put a haze in my head, putting me right where I want to be\u2014numb and obliviously stupid.</p><p>When she reaches me, she glides her palm up my chest and leans in, pressing her tits against me. \u201cThe last time I saw you, you were a scrawny twelve year-old with braces and glasses, but good God you\u2019ve changed.\u201d She traces a path from my chest to my stomach. \u201cYou\u2019re totally smoking hot now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s Nikki, right?\u201d I\u2019m remembering something about her... a time when we were kids and the whole neighborhood decided to play baseball. But it\u2019s nothing more than a distant memory I\u2019d rather forget. It reminds me too much of what was and what will never be again. \u201cYou\u2019ve...\u201d I scroll up her body, which I can pretty much see all of. \u201cChanged.\u201d</p><p>She takes it as a compliment, even though I didn\u2019t mean it that way. \u201cThanks.\u201d She smiles and shimmies her hips. \u201cI always try to look my best.\u201d</p><p>I still have the joint in my hand and I take another hit, trapping it in until my lungs feel like they\u2019re going to explode, then I free the smoke from my mouth and ash the joint on the already singed brown carpet. I hand it to Tristan, allowing the numbness to leach into my body. \u201cWhere should I put my stuff?\u201d I ask him.</p> <p>Dylan hitches a finger over at the hallway. \u201cThere\u2019s a room at the back of the hall. It\u2019s a little small, but it\u2019s got a bed and shit.\u201d</p><p>I collect my bag and move around Nikki, heading for the hall. \u201cI\u2019ll take whatever\u2019s easiest on everyone.\u201d</p><p>Dylan nods his head at the hallway and then says to Nikki, \u201cNikki, why don\u2019t you show Quinton where the room is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d She flashes an exaggerated smile at me and snatches the joint from Tristan\u2019s hand. She wraps her lips around the end, inhales, and then lets it out. She hands it back to him and then saunters in front of me so I can watch her ass as she struts down the hallway.</p><p>\u201cAre you two dating?\u201d I ask glancing back and forth between Nikki and Dylan.</p><p>Nikki rolls her eyes. \u201cUm, no.\u201d</p><p>Dylan departs for the small, cluttered kitchen in the corner of the house. \u201cI don\u2019t really date,\u201d he points out with a nonchalant shrug as he stuffs his hands in the pockets of his jeans. \u201cBesides, I have an old girlfriend of mine coming over tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDelilah?\u201d Tristan asks as he flops down on the couch, and Dylan nods. \u201cIs Nova back, too? Is she coming over with her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNova?\u201d I question. \u201cIs that like her car?\u201d</p><p>Tristan shakes his head and laughs. \u201cNo, it\u2019s a girl, you dipshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting name,\u201d I say, curious what a girl who\u2019s named after my favorite car would be like, but it doesn\u2019t really matter. None of it does. I\u2019ll never date again, never feel for anyone.</p><p>\u201cWould you get over her?\u201d Dylan scoops up a plastic cup that\u2019s by the kitchen sink and throws it at Tristan, who ducks as it zips above his head. \u201cYou made out with her one time, and she was fucking trashed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d Tristan retorts as he leans over the arm of the chair to pick up the cup. When he sits up, he throws the cup back at Dylan, but it lands on the floor a few inches away from him. \u201cYou\u2019re still hung up on Delilah after eight months of her being gone, and I can still have a thing for Nova if I want to. And it\u2019s not really even a thing, so much as I\u2019m curious about what she\u2019s like now after a year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a fucking liar.\u201d Dylan kicks the cup across the floor and jerks the fridge door open. \u201cAnd besides, Nova\u2019s got more baggage than you can handle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know how much I can handle,\u201d he mutters, staring down at the brownish orange carpet. He rubs his hand across his face and then blows out a breath, his gaze flicking up to me. There\u2019s a hint of anger transpiring in his eyes, directed toward me and what I represent, but beneath the anger there\u2019s also pain. Lots and lots of pain masked over by weed.</p><p>It\u2019s my cue to leave. I put some of Tristan\u2019s baggage there, since I\u2019m the one solely responsible for the death of his sister. I follow Nikki down the hallway, feeling like shit again as my past catches up with me. But I focus on the few steps ahead of me, knowing what\u2019s going to happen when I reach the room. It\u2019s obvious what Nikki wants, and honestly, I need the distraction. Today\u2019s been a rough day, especially after my father dropped me off at the airport. I could tell he didn\u2019t want to be there, but I think he felt obligated because I\u2019m his son.</p><p>\u201cSee you later,\u201d was all he said, and then he left me at the entrance doors.</p><p>I shouldn\u2019t have cared that he didn\u2019t give me a hug or anything, but I haven\u2019t been hugged in a year and sometimes I miss it, the connection, the contact, knowing that someone loves you.</p><p>\u201cSo the bed\u2019s supersoft.\u201d Nikki plops down on the twin bed and gives a little bounce, crossing her legs.</p><p>I drop the bag on the floor of the closet-sized room and stand in front of her, staring down at the filthy mattress. \u201cOh yeah?\u201d</p><p>She seductively grins at me. \u201cDefinitely.\u201d Then she reaches up and snatches the front of my shirt, tugging me down to her mouth.</p><p>Her lips are dry and taste like weed, but I close my eyes and kiss her back, shutting myself down as I lean over her and we collapse against the bed. I know it\u2019s wrong. Neither of us really gives a shit about the other. There\u2019s no meaning to it. It\u2019s as pointless as existing and equally as insignificant. But that\u2019s exactly what I deserve, and the moment that I do feel meaning\u2014the moment I feel the slightest bit of contentment and happiness with another woman\u2014is the moment I break my promise to Lexi.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>Nova</p><p>There\u2019s a strange kind of serenity that comes with silence, but maybe that\u2019s because it\u2019s nearly impossible to achieve. Not only do I have to shut out the outside noise, but I also have to tune out the noise within me, the thoughts that want to whisper who I am, what I should or shouldn\u2019t be feeling, what I did or didn\u2019t do\u2014what went wrong. Sometimes, when I\u2019m awake late at night, I try to achieve the blissful serenity of silence, but it\u2019s always the part that I didn\u2019t do that ruins it for me, the constant whispering in my head. You should have saved him. I wonder if Landon ever achieved that silence and if that\u2019s why he did it. Maybe he heard nothing at all, and he took that as a sign that it was time to end things.</p><p>\u201cHow do I look?\u201d Delilah fixes her lipstick in the rearview mirror of the old pickup she used to drive around before we left for college. She blots her lips and then looks at me with a dazzling smile.</p><p>\u201cYou look perfect.\u201d I, on the other hand, didn\u2019t even bother to brush my hair, because I\u2019m not here to impress. I\u2019m here because she wants me to be here. Nothing more. Nothing less.</p><p>She reaches down the front of her low-cut crimson top and rearranges her boobs so she shows more cleavage. It gets a small smile out of me, but the momentary spark of life is quickly buried as I start to count the stairs leading up to the single-wide trailer home in front of us, and the amount of tires piled on the front lawn. Four and eight.</p><p>Her gaze slowly skims across my short floral dress and my feather earrings. \u201cYou look nice,\u201d she says with accusation. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not wanting to hook up with a certain someone again?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and aim my finger at her. \u201cI already told you that hooking up with Tristan was a onetime thing.\u201d</p><p>Delilah raises her brows in doubt. \u201cWhatever you say.\u201d</p><p>I sigh and start to climb out of the truck, but she captures my arm, preventing me from going further. \u201cWait. You should add this to your little movie thing.\u201d</p><p>I glance around at the trailer park, the dogs barking behind the neighbor\u2019s fence, and the car next door that\u2019s rusted, tireless, and balanced on cinder blocks. \u201cThis place?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She smacks my arm, laughing. \u201cNo, me right now. I could say what I\u2019m feeling right now or something. I mean, isn\u2019t that the point of what you\u2019re doing? To figure out how people feel and see life?\u201d</p><p>I shrug, my legs hanging out of the car as I prepare to jump out. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I was kind of just thinking that it could be like a video diary or something about my life... my thoughts... the way I see things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m huge part of your life, Nova Reed. You better include me in this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you seriously just last-name me, Delilah Peirce?\u201d</p> <p>She grins, grabbing the keys from the ignition. \u201cOh, yeah. Now pull out that damn camera so I can tell the world my insightful views on life.\u201d</p><p>I readjust my legs back into the car and retrieve my phone from my pocket, regretting telling her my summer filming plan. \u201cOkay.\u201d I swipe my finger across the screen and click on the video icon.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re so going to get you a real camera.\u201d She turns sideways in the seat and tousles her auburn hair with her fingers. \u201cThat thing\u2019s going to make me look all blotchy.\u201d</p><p>I hold up the phone, positioning it so I can see her in the screen. \u201cYou know they cost a shitload of money, right?\u201d I click Record. \u201cOkay, go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, what should I say?\u201d she asks, still fussing over her hair. The sun shines brightly behind her and all that\u2019s really showing up on the screen is her silhouette. \u201cI\u2019m drawing a blank.\u201d</p> <p>Pressing my lips together, I try to restrain the laughter bubbling up in my throat. \u201cI don\u2019t know. You\u2019re the one who wanted to do this.\u201d</p><p>She narrows her eyes at me. \u201cWell, you\u2019re the director.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not,\u201d I protest. \u201cI\u2019m just a girl with a camera trying to see life through a different eye.\u201d</p><p>She points a finger at me and gives a clever look. \u201cThat should be your title.\u201d</p><p>I sigh with frustration. \u201cIt only records for a few minutes, so if you\u2019re going to say something, you better hurry up and do it.\u201d</p><p>She wavers for a few seconds longer, and then smiles perkily at the camera, flipping her hair off her shoulder. \u201cOkay, so here\u2019s the deal. I know what you\u2019re all thinking. That I\u2019m just a ditzy redhead wearing slutty clothes that\u2019s about to go in and screw her ex-boyfriend who cheated on her.\u201d She waves her finger at the camera and clicks her tongue. \u201cBut don\u2019t be fooled, my friend. What you see on the outside might not be who I am on the inside, and I always have my reasons for the crazy, impulsive things that I do.\u201d She strikes a pose, blowing a kiss at the camera, and then rolls her eyes and her shoulders slump. \u201cOkay, Nova, I\u2019m done.\u201d</p> <p>I keep recording for a few seconds longer. She\u2019s never said anything like that before, and I find it fascinating that she\u2019ll say it to a camera, especially with me behind the lens. I press Stop, and the screen shifts back to the icon. I tuck my phone back in my pocket, and Delilah grabs the door handle.</p><p>\u201cShall we?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I nod. \u201cWe shall.\u201d</p><p>We climb out of the truck and meet around the front. I start counting my steps the moment we head across the gravel. One... two... three...</p><p>\u201cSo I was thinking we should relax tonight,\u201d Delilah says, linking arms with me as we walk toward the gate lined with rusty five-gallon paint buckets.</p><p>Four... five... six...</p><p>\u201cAnd avoid any kind of drama,\u201d she adds as she opens the chain-link gate.</p><p>Seven... eight... nine... \u201cLike getting into fights?\u201d I latch the gate shut. Ten... eleven... twelve...</p> <p>When we make it to the front door, she slips her arm from mine. \u201cHey, I only did that once,\u201d she says, squaring her shoulders and sticking out her chest. \u201cAnd the bitch deserved it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou broke her arm,\u201d I remind her, as she raps her fist on the door.</p><p>\u201cShe tried to kiss Dylan,\u201d she hisses with a conniving grin, then she pops her knuckles. \u201cShe totally deserved more. She\u2019s lucky you were there to stop me.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and a small smile escapes. Every once in a while, in the rarest of moments, I manage to get it right: to smile without feeling guilty about it. But as quick as it comes, I\u2019m frowning again as I drift back into the numbness.</p><p>\u201cCome in!\u201d Someone hollers from the other side of the door after Delilah knocks on it again.</p><p>She puts her flirting face on, hiking up her denim skirt a little, before shoving the door open and strutting inside. I follow her, walking into a room full of humidified smoke tainted with the stench of weed, dingy plaid sofas, and a cracked coffee table. The wood panel walls have water stains on them, and the once white ceiling is discolored. The kitchen to my side overflows with empty alcohol bottles, cigarette butts, dirty dishes, and garbage. On the far wall is what I\u2019m guessing is a hallway, but a putrid orange curtain hangs over the entrance. A little over a year ago, I\u2019d never be caught in a place like this\u2014it wasn\u2019t who I was or who Landon would let me be. But I don\u2019t know who I am anymore, and that makes it harder to find reasons not to be here, except for maybe the fact that the unfamiliarity raises the obsessive need to count all the damn photos hanging on the wooden paneling.</p><p>\u201cHoly hell. You look even more beautiful than I remember.\u201d Dylan rises from the chair he\u2019s lounging in and places the cigarette he\u2019s holding in the ashtray. He\u2019s tall, kind of lanky, and his head is shaved. There are intricate tattoos covering his arms, most in black, but a few are filled in with shades of crimson and indigo.</p><p>Delilah lets out a squeal as she jumps up and down, then runs into Dylan\u2019s arms. They embrace each other passionately and immediately seal their lips together in a fervent kiss. Tristan, who\u2019s playing darts over in the far corner by himself, looks at me then rolls his eyes at Delilah and Dylan, giving me a halfhearted shrug. I don\u2019t know Tristan very well, but he\u2019s always seemed like a really nice guy. Under normal circumstances kissing him would have probably been enjoyable. He had nice lips, and even though his blond hair is a little scraggly, it\u2019s really soft. He has lean arms, is tall with broad shoulders, and has dark blue eyes. In reality, as I look at him, he seems out of place in a home like this, littered with glass bongs and roach clips and ceramic pipes, kind of similar to the ones Landon kept hidden in his room.</p><p>Minutes later, Dylan\u2019s and Delilah\u2019s lips are still attached, and their hands roam all over each other as they wander through the curtain, leaving me in the room with Tristan and his darts.</p><p>He watches me for a moment, and then grabs a red plastic cup from the coffee table. \u201cSo what have you been up to?\u201d he asks, setting the cup down after he takes a swallow. He turns back to the dartboard, aiming the tip of one while shutting an eye.</p><p>\u201cSchool.\u201d I wind around a sofa, reducing the distance between us. There\u2019s music playing from an old stereo in the corner, \u201cEmily\u201d by From First to Last. \u201cOther than that, not a whole lot.\u201d I step up beside him and stare at the dartboard as he throws the dart, hitting it just outside of the center. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs and extends his hand for the cup again. \u201cWork, life, honestly nothing that great.\u201d He puts the rim of the cup up to his lips and tips his head back, chugging a mouth full before crushing the cup and tossing it into an overflowing trash can in the corner near a lamp without a lampshade. \u201cYou need a drink or something?\u201d</p><p>I debate my options. The buzz from the few sips I took from the flask has simmered down, so either I can stand here and count all night until Delilah finishes up with Dylan or I can take Tristan up on his offer and try to find some kind of silence in alcohol. \u201cWhat do you have?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He smiles and motions at me to follow him as he hops over the back of the couch and proceeds for the kitchen. I choose to walk around the sofa, constructing my own path, noting it takes me twelve controlled, steady steps to follow him to the fridge. He opens the door, pokes his head inside, and starts rummaging around through the various brands of beer. He ends up selecting a Corona, and I can\u2019t help but briefly smile because after eight months he still remembers my drink. He kicks the fridge door shut with his foot, walks over to the counter, and places the top of the bottle on the edge of the countertop, knocking the cap off.</p><p>The golden liquid bubbles as he hands me the opened bottle. \u201cHere ya go.\u201d</p><p>I let out a breath I didn\u2019t realize I\u2019d been holding and move the mouth of the bottle up to my mouth. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>He squeezes between me and the counter and moves back to the living room, rolling up the sleeves of his long-sleeved black shirt. \u201cNo problem,\u201d he says. \u201cYou look a little tense anyway. Maybe that\u2019ll relax you.\u201d</p><p>Nothing will relax me. Ever. Nothing will drown out the memories of that day\u2014no matter how much I fight it\u2014everything I missed. Why did you do it, Landon? Why? As soon as my mind recollects the faint flicker of his sad laughter, the feeling of that goddamn night start to chip away at the wall I put around it. I blink and blink again as tears start to sting my eyes. Shut the hell up. Shut the hell up. Now is not the time. Wait until you\u2019re at home, alone. But they pool in the corners of my eyes, hot liquid about to burn down my cheeks and stain my skin. Panicking, I start to count the lines of the panels that make up the wall. I reach fifteen, and then I tilt my head back, and gulp down half the Corona before I can breathe again.</p><p>\u201cYou good?\u201d Tristan asks, watching me devour the beer as he holds an assortment of darts in his hand.</p><p>I lick the remaining beer off my lips and stride over to the dartboard. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m great, but can I play? I need a distraction.\u201d</p><p>A smile curves at his lips as I start to remove the red darts from the board. \u201cAbsolutely, but how about we make it fun and play for something?\u201d His gaze skims up my bare legs, to the hem of my dress, and then up to my eyes. I think he\u2019s going to propose something sexual, by the fiery look in his eyes, but all he says is, \u201cWinner owes the loser twenty bucks?\u201d</p><p>I suck back the remaining tears still wanting to spill and stick out my hand. \u201cYou have a deal.\u201d</p><p>We shake on it and he gives my hand a squeeze before pulling away. \u201cLadies first,\u201d he says and then steps back toward the couch, making room for me to step up.</p><p>I weave around him and position myself in front of the board. I count backward before I inhale and hold my breath as I throw the dart. It hits the bull\u2019s-eye. I force myself to breathe through the memory of the last time Landon and I played darts and he let me win, even though he denied it.</p><p>\u201cWow, I think I might have just thrown away twenty bucks.\u201d Tristan rubs his scruffy jawline and steps up to the dartboard, taking his time targeting the dart. When he shoots it, he starts cursing as the dart bows to the side. It ends up hitting the outer edge of the board and he turns to me, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I think I might have had one too many drinks to be playing darts for money,\u201d he says, sitting down on the arm of the chair. He looks me over as the light above my head flickers. \u201cWhere\u2019d you learn how to play like that? Or was it beginner\u2019s luck?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Without looking at the dartboard, I toss the dart and it almost hits another bull\u2019s-eye. \u201cI learned from the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d He slants his head as the corners of his lips quirk. \u201cWas it Dell down at the bar?\u201d he jokes, because Dell\u2019s the town drunk and thinks he\u2019s the champion of everything. \u201cBecause he\u2019s always bragging about being a super dart champion.\u201d</p><p>I swallow hard as vivid memories puncture my brain. \u201cThis guy I used to date taught me, actually.\u201d I take another long sip, telling my head to shut up. Don\u2019t go there. Please don\u2019t go there. Not right now.</p><p>I hear his breath catch as he probably remembers what happened. Everyone in this town heard about it within hours after it happened, and it\u2019s been kind of hard for everyone to forget. It wasn\u2019t too long after Tristan\u2019s sister died, but hers was by accident, a simple wrong place at the wrong time.</p> <p>After a gap of silence drags by, Tristan blows out a breath and stands up from the armrest. \u201cYou want a shot or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please,\u201d I say way too quickly and wind the neck of the nearly finished Corona around in my hand, channeling my tension on it.</p><p>He walks over to the kitchen area and digs around in the cupboards, hunting for shot glasses. I sit down on the sofa, tip my head back and suck down the last of the Corona, regretting my decision to come back here. Not to Dylan\u2019s house, but back home. I\u2019d been okay at college\u2014not great, but okay, or at least focused on something besides my obsessive compulsions and Landon\u2019s death.</p><p>A giggle floats from the hallway and I gratefully exhale, thinking it\u2019s Delilah. I start to get up but when the curtain is drawn back, I sink back down when a leggy blonde steps out, adjusting her top back over her bulging curves.</p><p>She takes one look at me and then plasters on a plastic smile. \u201cHey... it\u2019s Nova, right?\u201d</p> <p>I have no idea who she is, but she looks about my age. \u201cYeah...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike the car.\u201d The sound of his voice is familiar, way too familiar, like the world has decided to play a cruel joke on me. When a guy steps out of the hallway, I just about drop dead on the floor as the similarity intensifies and sends my mind spinning. Everything about him screams Landon, and for a second I really believe it\u2019s him.</p><p>It\u2019s not really the similarities in features as much as something less visible. He\u2019s taller than Landon, with dark brown hair inside of black, and it\u2019s shaven short instead of hanging in his eyes. He also has slightly more muscle tone to him, and there\u2019s an indistinct scar over his top lip. All these things don\u2019t match up, but it\u2019s the little details that push an insanity button in my head. Like the charcoal on his hands, or the fact that the laces of his boots are untied, something Landon used to do all the time. The sound of his voice, deep and smooth like melted butter, has a strikingly comparable ring to it. And his eyes. Those goddamn honey-brown eyes with so much sorrow in them it nearly swallows any happiness in the room. I\u2019ve only seen that much sadness in one person\u2019s eyes. Ever. And when they lock on me, it\u2019s like I\u2019m drowning in his sorrow\u2014Landon\u2019s sorrow.</p><p>I continue to stare at him, and I can tell it\u2019s making him uneasy, but I can\u2019t seem to look away. It\u2019s like I\u2019m waking up a year ago and he hasn\u2019t left me on the hillside, alone, not just on the grass, but in the world.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d The sound of Tristan\u2019s voice slams into my chest and rips me from my daze.</p><p>I tear my eyes away from the guy and blink up at Tristan. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p> <p>He has a small shot glass in his hand that\u2019s topped off with a crystal clear liquid. \u201cYou look upset.\u201d He glances over at the guy and then back at me. \u201cAre you okay, Nova?\u201d</p><p>I nod, snatch the shot out of his hand, and slam it back, basking in the burn. Then I set the empty glass down on the table and press my hand to my burning throat. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m just tired.\u201d</p><p>Tristan\u2019s not buying it, but he doesn\u2019t press. We\u2019re not good enough friends for him to press. He takes a seat in the tattered leather recliner that\u2019s shredded to pieces. I try to keep my gaze fixed on the popped seams in the armrest, but I can\u2019t help but glance over at the guy with honey-brown eyes, even though I don\u2019t want to.</p><p>He sits down on the sofa to the side of me, and the blonde strategically places her ass onto his lap. She giggles as she runs her fingers over his head, but he only seems mildly interested as he retrieves a pack of cigarettes from the coffee table and pops one into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cSo did Dylan wander back there?\u201d Tristan asks, sipping on his beer.</p><p>The guy shrugs as he cups his hand around the end of the cigarette, flicks a lighter, and the end crinkles and shrivels. \u201cI think they went into his room, but I\u2019m not sure.\u201d Smoke snakes out of his lips.</p><p>\u201cWith that bitch Delilah,\u201d the blonde says, shooting me a malicious look.</p><p>Okay, so she knows Delilah and obviously hates her, which isn\u2019t surprising\u2014most girls do. But why does she seem to hate me?</p> <p>\u201cOh shit,\u201d Tristan says, smacking his head with the heel of his hand. \u201cI totally fucking forgot introductions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe already know who she is,\u201d the blonde sneers, glaring at me. \u201cThat\u2019s Nova Reed.\u201d</p><p>I have no clue what her names is, and I think Tristan can tell. \u201cNikki, quit being a bitch,\u201d he says.</p><p>Nikki. It clicks. She used to go to school with me before she dropped out. She also used to have a crush on Landon right before I started dating him at the beginning of senior year. She\u2019s changed a lot, put on some weight in the chest area, and her hair used to be light brown, not bleached blonde.</p><p>Nikki huffs, poking her chest out as she crosses her arms, then she reclines against the guy\u2019s chest. \u201cQuit being an asshole,\u201d she snaps at Tristan, and then bats her eyelashes at the guy.</p><p>The guy shifts his weight, throwing her off balance, and she slides off his lap and lands on the couch. \u201cSorry, but he\u2019s my cousin and this is his house. If he says quit being a bitch to Nova\u201d\u2014he glances at me with a quirk at his lips and a furrow at his brows\u2014\u201cthen quit being a bitch.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t like the way my heart leaps in my chest when he says my name or that he remembers my name when he only heard it a minute ago. I hate how I can\u2019t seem to look away from him and find something to count, because if I could, then I could call down the storm building in my chest.</p><p>Nikki looks pissed, but she keeps her lips sealed. The guy takes a deep inhale from his cigarette as he reaches for the remote on the coffee table. Tristan gets up from the recliner and heads down the hall. It grows quiet, and the guy whose name I still don\u2019t know picks up a remote and flips through the songs on the stereo. Nikki makes it her mission to glare at me, but I barely pay attention. All my focus is on the ghost of a memory sitting next to me. I know he\u2019s really not Landon, but he\u2019s chillingly comparable, even in the way he moves.</p><p>Eventually, looking at him becomes too much, and I get up and walk out of the house. I step into the cool night, place my hands on the railing, and hunch over, battling back the memories as they thrust their way to the surface, counting under my breath, doing everything I can to focus on the numbers instead of the images, but the images conclusively win.</p><p>\u201cSo if you could only paint one thing over and over again for the rest of your life, what would it be?\u201d I hold on to the stairway railing and watch Landon sit on the bottom step and sketch the old oak tree on the hill in the backyard. \u201cThat tree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t paint anything,\u201d he says. His hand moves perfectly along the white sheet of paper, staining it with shades of gray and black. He pauses, glancing over his shoulder at me, with a ghost smile touching his lips. \u201cYou know how much I hate painting.\u201d</p><p>I scrunch my nose and sink down on the step beside him. \u201cOkay, then, what would you sketch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I could only sketch one thing?\u201d he asks, and I nod. He taps the end of his pencil on his chin, leaving black smudges. \u201cProbably you.\u201d</p><p>I stick out my tongue, but my heart dances. I\u2019ve often wondered what it would be like if he really did like me, if he kissed me, if he were my boyfriend instead of just my friend. \u201cYou so would not. If you were to actually pick a person, which I doubt you would, you\u2019d probably pick someone like Karisa Harris.\u201d</p><p>He wavers. \u201cI have to admit, she does have a nice rack.\u201d</p><p>I slap his arm, pretending to be offended, even though I\u2019m used to it. We\u2019ve been friends for four years, and he\u2019s a seventeen-year-old guy. Being a pervert is kind of a given. \u201cThat\u2019s so gross,\u201d I say.</p><p>When he rolls his tongue to hold back his laughter, I swat his arm again, and his laughter slips through. Landon rarely laughs, so even though he\u2019s irritating me, I let it go and laugh with him, because the sound of it makes it hard to stay angry. Eventually he quiets down and licks his lips, almost licking the charcoal off.</p><p>Shaking my head, I reach forward, place my thumb on one of the smudges right by his lips, and rub it away, trying to ignore the intensity in his gaze as he watches me. \u201cYou always have this stuff on you, even when you\u2019re not sketching,\u201d I remark as I pull my hand away. But he stops me with a touch of his fingers. I freeze as he wraps his hand over mine, and my heart starts to flutter inside my chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking.\u201d He brings my hand back to his mouth. \u201cAbout trying something,\u201d he whispers against my palm.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah.\u201d My voice cracks and I can\u2019t stop staring at his lips.</p><p>He nods, without taking his eyes off me. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about it for a while...\u201d He takes a deep breath and then lets it out, seeming uneasy. \u201cAbout kissing you.\u201d</p><p>My pulse quickens as he pauses, like he\u2019s waiting for me to say something, but my throat is thick with my nerves and I can\u2019t get my lips to form words. I\u2019ve never kissed a guy before, and Landon isn\u2019t just a guy. He\u2019s my best friend. Even though I\u2019ve thought about it many times, I\u2019ve also thought about what it would be like to lose him. He\u2019s the only one who keeps me connected to the world ever since my dad died. Without him, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d be, or if I\u2019d be anything.</p><p>I start to protest, but then he shuts his eyes, and my doubts temporarily wash away from the feel of his lips against the palm of my hand. He kisses it gradually, like he\u2019s savoring the moment\u2014and knowing Landon, he probably is. He moves his lips down to my wrist and he does the same thing there, only this time he slips out his tongue and I bite down on my lip as I shudder. My eyes close on their own accord, and I hold my breath in anticipation, waiting for him to kiss me. I wait. And wait, but nothing happens.</p><p>\u201cNova,\u201d he says in a low, husky voice. \u201cOpen your eyes.\u201d</p><p>I obey, marginally disappointed because I really thought he was going to kiss me.</p><p>His honey-brown eyes are smoldering cinders in the fiery sunlight. His lips part and then he seals them together again, eyeing my mouth before sighing. \u201cI wasn\u2019t lying,\u201d he says, looking back at the tree as he puts the tip of his pencil back to the paper. \u201cI could spend hours\u2014even days\u2014sketching you. It would be perfect.\u201d He delicately touches the corner of my eye with his fingertips, before pulling back, the uneasiness in his eyes amplifying. \u201cEspecially those.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I don\u2019t know what to say to him, so I keep my lips fastened, watching him as he tucks his head down and wisps of his hair fall into his eyes. His hand starts moving again, tracing the lines of the massive leafless tree in the distance. The uneasiness quickly erases from his expression as he falls into his peace with his art, and I get lost in my thoughts of why he didn\u2019t kiss me and why he looked so sad when he was about to.</p><p>I start to dry-heave as the burn of the alcohol forces its way back up my throat. Leaning over the railing, I gag until my stomach is empty, my abdominal muscles are throbbing, and the gravel below is drenched in my vomit. Wiping my mouth off with the back of my hand, I turn around and sink down onto the deck. Hugging my knees to my chest, I recline against the railing and angle my head back, looking up at the stars shining vibrantly against the charcoaled sky. I start counting them, one by one, and my mind and body start to relax.</p><p>I remain that way until the front door to the trailer swings open and then slams shut. Tearing my gaze away from the night, I look over at the door, hoping it\u2019ll be Delilah and I can get the hell out of here. But it\u2019s just Nikki.</p><p>She looks livid, her face red as she stomps down the stairs toward the gravel driveway. \u201cFuck you... and fuck your stupid art.\u201d</p> <p>The door opens again and the guy with honey-brown eyes walks out with an unlit cigarette stuck between his lips. Standing at the top of the stairs, he cups his hands around the end of the cigarette, lighting it while Nikki slips off one of her fluorescent pink stilettos.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an asshole, you know that?\u201d she cries and then chucks her shoe at him.</p><p>He blows out a breath of smoke as the shoe flies by his head, but he doesn\u2019t even flinch. Nikki stomps her bare foot on the ground as the guy steps back and bends down to collect her shoe. He walks to the top of the stairs and extends the stiletto out to her and she snatches it from him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never hook up with you again,\u201d she spits, wiggling her foot into her shoe as she stumbles to the side in the loose gravel. \u201cYou\u2019re ridiculous... you\u2019re like a...\u201d She gets her foot into the stiletto and she stands upright. \u201cDo you even feel anything at all?\u201d She folds her arms and taps her foot as she waits for him to respond.</p><p>He takes a long drag, his chest rising and falling as he releases the smoke out in front of his face. \u201cNot really,\u201d he says with a frown, brushing his thumb along the bottom of the cigarette. Ashes scatter all over the ground.</p> <p>She clenches her fists, lets out a frustrated scream, and then she storms off for her car, her hair whipping across her shoulder as she whirls. He watches her car backs away, then he rests his arms on the railing and stares off into the darkness of the trailer park.</p><p>The longer he stands there, the more I wonder if he even realizes I\u2019m sitting here. Should I just get up and leave? Stay put until he goes back in? I\u2019m starting to get nervous, my palms beginning to sweat, because I can\u2019t make a decision.</p><p>\u201cSo did your parents really name you after the car?\u201d he unexpectedly says without looking at me.</p><p>It takes me a moment to answer. \u201cMy dad had one when I was born. He loved it and he loved me, so he thought the name was fitting.\u201d</p><p>He nods, then turns around and reclines against the railing, slanting his head to look at me. \u201cDoes he still have the car?\u201d</p><p>I begin to shake my head but then halt, contemplating how to respond. \u201cWell, it\u2019s parked in the garage at my mom\u2019s house, but it\u2019s not his anymore.\u201d I summon a breath as he gives me a confused look and even though I don\u2019t want to, I add, \u201cHe died six years ago. He left the car to me, but I don\u2019t know... I\u2019d feel weird driving it.\u201d I have no idea why I\u2019m telling him this. I never talk to people about my father, except for Landon and sometimes the camera.</p> <p>\u201cI get it,\u201d he states. This look crosses his face; sadness, mixed with anger, tinted with shame. \u201cSorry about Nikki. She\u2019s just pissed off at me about... well, I honestly can\u2019t fucking remember.\u201d He gazes off, looking lost, and I notice how red and bloodshot his eyes are. He\u2019s probably stoned and by morning he probably won\u2019t remember any of this. Or me. Strangely, that thought makes me a little depressed.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to apologize for her.\u201d I place my feet underneath me and stand up, dusting the dirt off the back of my legs. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. Nikki is always kind of bitchy, if I\u2019m remembering right.\u201d</p><p>A smile starts to form at his lips, but it dissolves by the time I take my next breath. \u201cWell, that\u2019s nice to know. That it\u2019s not just me that unleashes it from her.\u201d</p><p>I relax back against the railing and prop my elbows against the wood. There are only the steps between us, but he seems really far away from me. \u201cHow do you know her? You don\u2019t live here, right?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head as he puts the cigarette into his mouth and takes a drag. \u201cI\u2019m just here for the summer. Tristan\u2019s my cousin, and I need a place to crash. He stepped up.\u201d Smoke eases from his lips as he shrugs with a miserable look on his face.</p><p>\u201cTristan\u2019s nice,\u201d I say, shuffling my toes back and forth in front of me. \u201cI\u2019ve known him since I was a kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s a good guy.\u201d He frowns at the ground, his brow puckered. \u201cHe can totally look past stuff, you know.\u201d He lets out a faltering exhale, and when he looks up at me I nearly fall down. It\u2019s too much. He looks so much like him, and I don\u2019t know what to do. My heart feels like it\u2019s rupturing open again. I want to run, hide, and not go through this again, but I also what to take the pain away from him, like I couldn\u2019t do the first time around.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d I ask, taking a tentative step toward him, knowing that by asking I\u2019m pushing the door open a little.</p> <p>\u201cOh, sorry,\u201d he apologizes, extending his hand. His palm is covered with smudged charcoal. \u201cIt\u2019s Quinton.\u201d</p><p>I half-expected him to say Landon. My fingers tremble as I place my hand into his, but once I come into contact with him, I find myself feeling calm for the first time in a year. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Quinton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s nice to meet you, Nova-like-the-car.\u201d A small trace of a smile appears at his lips again as he wraps his long fingers around mine and his skin is warm. I don\u2019t like that it is because the last time I touched Landon\u2019s skin it was ice-cold, and it painfully reminds me that Quinton\u2019s not him, that he\u2019s just someone who looks like him, and not even that. He\u2019s just someone who carries anguish and torture inside, like Landon did.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re going to be here for the whole summer?\u201d I ask, unable to let go of his hand, aware that the calm will leave me the moment I let go\u2014let go of Landon again.</p><p>He nods, adjusting his hand, and I think he\u2019s going to pull away. But he continues to hold on to mine. \u201cYeah, at least until I can figure out a plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, a life plan, or whatever the hell people call it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t call it anything,\u201d I say with honesty. \u201cI don\u2019t really have one.\u201d</p><p>He assesses me closely with a confounded expression. \u201cYeah, me either.\u201d His forehead creases and he bites at his lip, fleetingly glancing at mine. \u201cDo you want to\u2014\u201d</p><p>The screen door swings open and bangs against the side of the house. We swiftly pull our hands away as Delilah and Dylan stroll out with smiles on their faces and contentment in their eyes. Delilah notices Quinton and me pulling away from each other and she shoots me a discreet, quizzical look, but I\u2019m too distracted by the calmness evaporating from my body to return an answer.</p><p>\u201cWell, I see you two skipped right past the introductions,\u201d Dylan comments like he has some sort of insight into what was going on. But nothing was going on, at least that\u2019s what I\u2019m telling myself.</p><p>He pulls out a pack of cigarettes from the pocket of his unbuttoned plaid shirt and starts tapping it on his wrist while Delilah pops the tab of the beer she\u2019s holding and smoothes down her ruffled auburn hair.</p><p>Quinton flicks his cigarette over the railing. \u201cI\u2019m going inside,\u201d he mutters, then hurries for the door.</p><p>My fingers long to grab on to the back of his shirt so I can drag him back and beg him to tell me why he looks so depressed, but all I do is watch him walk away. When the door slams shut behind him, I feel guiltier than I ever have in my entire life.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready to go,\u201d I tell Delilah, wrapping my arm around my stomach as nausea sets in.</p><p>Usually Delilah argues when I want to bail out early, but she takes one look at me and nods. \u201cOkay, meet me at the truck.\u201d</p><p>I nod and walk quickly toward the gate, taking even but swift strides, reminding myself to count and breathe. I climb in the car and tap the lock, while I mentally bottle up my feelings. Delilah kisses Dylan good-bye on the top of the stairs. By the time she climbs in the truck, I\u2019m somewhat settled down.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Nova, are you okay?\u201d she asks as she slides into the driver\u2019s seat and slams the car door. \u201cYou looked like you were about to throw up or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a shot.\u201d I slouch down in the seat and overlap my arms on top of my stomach. \u201cIt made me a little sick.\u201d</p><p>She puts the keys in the ignition and the engine roars to life. \u201cI\u2019ve seen you slam down like five shots in a row before. Tell me what\u2019s really up. Was it... did something happen with that Quinton guy? Because Dylan says he has major issues, and I think that\u2019s probably the last thing you need.\u201d She pauses, considering something as she fiddles with the radio station. \u201cAlthough it\u2019d be nice to see you date someone. All I\u2019ve ever seen you do is kiss a few random guys when you occasionally get really drunk.\u201d</p><p>I stare at the trailer\u2019s front door as she backs up. \u201cBecause that\u2019s all I want to do,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd nothing happened between Quinton and me.\u201d The sentence feels like the biggest lie I\u2019ve ever told, because something did happen.</p><p>I felt something for the first time in over a year, but what it was I\u2019m not sure.</p><p>Quinton</p><p>I only came outside to make sure Nikki didn\u2019t say any more shit to Nova, and now I\u2019m holding her goddamn hand. I know what I\u2019m doing is wrong, but I can\u2019t seem to let go of her hand and I need to let go of it and walk away. Now. Leave the poor girl alone. You avoid girls like this for a reason. You don\u2019t need to ruin more lives or get attached. No matter how hard I try, though, I can\u2019t seem to convince myself to do the right thing and walk away. Nova looks so lonely, sad, and alarmingly unsettled, and I just want to make her feel better. Somehow.</p><p>It\u2019s not like we\u2019re talking about anything important, but I don\u2019t like how I\u2019m noticing how beautiful she is or how I start to wonder what it would be like to sketch her. She has these amazingly striking eyes that probably look blue to a lot of people, but when I study them more closely, I notice little specks of green hiding in them. Her lips look soft as hell and there are freckles on her nose, and I can picture myself taking hours sketching each one. I love how her hair falls down on her bare shoulders and the slight crookedness of her nose. It\u2019s the little imperfections on her that make her ideal for drawing, and I want to take her back in my room and stare at her for hours. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She also makes me smile twice, and it\u2019s been a long time since someone\u2019s made me smile. When I realize what kind of emotions are emerging inside me, I panic and my thoughts get jumbled. I almost end up asking her to come inside with me, and that\u2019s the last thing I want to do with a girl like her, one that will actually talk to me instead of just fuck me. The ones that have no substance and like to fuck are the ones I\u2019ll never care about, and that\u2019s what I need\u2014deserve. Plus, it\u2019s already been made pretty clear that Tristan has a thing for her, and he\u2019s the last person I\u2019d ever want to steal a girl from.</p><p>Luckily Dylan walks outside right as I\u2019m about to ask Nova to come into the house, and I take the opportunity to make a quick exit back inside and make a beeline straight for the fridge to get a beer.</p><p>Tristan scrutinizes me from the couch with his feet kicked up on the coffee table, as he works to clean the resin out of a glass pipe with a small pocket knife. \u201cWhat were you doing out there?\u201d</p><p>I grab a beer and slam the fridge door shut. \u201cJust talking.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWith Nova.\u201d He frowns, obviously not thrilled about the idea.</p><p>I pop the cap off the beer and toss it in the trash. \u201cYeah, but you don\u2019t need to worry.\u201d</p><p>He sets the pipe down on the table by his feet. \u201cWho said I was worried?\u201d</p><p>I shrug and cross the living room, ready to lock myself up in my room, so I can singe my brain cells away and draw for hours. \u201cI was just under the impression you had a thing for her.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t say anything and the tension between us builds. I duck underneath the curtain, wishing that I wasn\u2019t here, wishing that it was a year ago and that I would have gotten the car pulled over in time.</p> <p>After I make it into my room and lock the door, I go to the two things that make me feel content. I grab the pipe and bag of weed Tristan lent me from off the dresser and my sketchpad from out of my duffel bag, then I sink down on the bed. I set the sketchpad aside, take the lighter out of my pocket, and pack the pipe before putting the mouthpiece up to my lips. Flicking the lighter, I suck in a deep breath and inhale the numbness in large, welcoming breaths. Once my lungs are charred and the restlessness in my body has stilled, I lean back against the bed, prop the sketchbook on my knees, and start to trace lines on a drawing I\u2019ve been working on for a year but have never been able to complete. Because once I finish it, I\u2019ll finally have to accept that Lexi\u2019s really gone. And that I killed her.</p><p>I keep drawing and drawing, smoking bowl after bowl, until I\u2019m so lost in my own head, all that\u2019s left to do is pass out. I toss my sketchpad aside and lay down on the filthy mattress, shutting my eyes, hoping I\u2019m high enough that the nightmares don\u2019t take over my sleep. But usually, I\u2019m not that lucky.</p><p>Blood gushes down my forehead, down my cheeks, so thick I can barely see. My chest is aching, the pain more unbearable then when I accidentally smashed my thumb with a hammer and broke all the bones in it. I feel like I can\u2019t move, and I have to work to keep my lungs gasping for air.</p><p>I\u2019m upside down, the blood is rushing to my head, and the sky is now the floor of the car. There are rocks and dirt and glass everywhere, and I can see a continuously flashing light out of my peripheral vision.</p><p>I cough, and blood streams from my lips. Searching around the dark, I feel around until I find the buckle to the seat belt. I push the button, the buckle slips out, and the strap on my shoulders loosens. I fall down, hitting my head on the mangled roof of the car. I cough up some more blood as I turn on my side and push myself up on my hands and knees, blinking through the pain ringing through my skull, and crawl out of the car. I glance back inside, noting that no one is left in the car. Where did they go? Did they climb out and go to get help? Did they... did they get thrown out? I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m the only one who had a seat belt on. Why didn\u2019t I make them put theirs on?</p><p>It\u2019s hard to see anything but the headlights flashing through the trees surrounding the lake, and all I can hear is the waves rushing toward me. Sucking in a breath, I stagger to my feet and stumble across the gravel, broken glass and crunched metal, grunting at the pain that erupts through my chest. My shirt is ripped open and so is my chest, and blood pours out of my skin, soaking the fabric. It hurts more than my brain can register, but the pain doesn\u2019t matter. I need to find Lexi.</p> <p>Hunched over, I stagger up the edge of the road. \u201cLexi...\u201d I cough, stumbling over my own feet. I fall into the gravel and my palms split open \u201cLexi...\u201d My voice is weak, nearly soundless, but I push back to my feet and keep walking up the road. But a few steps up the road my knees give out on me and I crumple to the asphalt. God damn it, this is all my fault. I reach for my phone, but it\u2019s not in my back pocket.</p><p>My hand shakes as I try to remember what happened. We hit the other car, and then flipped a few times, before settling near the lake. \u201cShit...\u201d I struggle to breathe, my eyelids growing heavy as I roll onto my back and stare at the sky. I\u2019m about to give into exhaustion when I hear her voice.</p><p>\u201cQuinton...\u201d It\u2019s barely audible, but it gives me hope.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how, but I somehow I manage to get to my feet and run toward the sound of her voice, even as I lose more blood and I grow more light-headed. None of it matters, though. The pain. The injuries. How I feel inside and out. I just need to get to her. As I stumble around one of the trees and trip through the grass, I hear her voice again. I follow the sound, slowing down as the outline of her body comes into view, and suddenly all I want to do is lie down and die beside her.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>Nova</p><p>\u201cSo how long do I have to lay here like this?\u201d I ask Landon for the thousandth time. I\u2019m lying on his bed with my hands slack to my side and my head tipped back. The dress I\u2019m wearing has ridden up to the tops of my legs and I\u2019m pretty much flashing him. I went to rearrange it, but he told me not to move, that I was perfect the way that I was. I\u2019m actually kind of uncomfortable, but I gave into him, because it\u2019s really hard to say no when he looks at me with his puppy-dog eyes. He wins me over every time with them, no matter what. But then again, I\u2019d pretty much do anything for him.</p><p>\u201cYou are seriously the most impatient person I know.\u201d His hand sweeps across the paper, and there\u2019s a trace of a smile on his lips. He\u2019s not wearing a shirt and I have no idea why\u2014he was bare chested when I showed up early today. He has jeans on, and his hair hangs down on his forehead in traditional Landon style. The room smells like pot, probably because he was smoking some before I came over. He hates smoking it around me and says I\u2019m too good to be doing it myself. But it makes no sense to me, because if I\u2019m too good for it, then why isn\u2019t he?</p> <p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re seriously the slowest person I know,\u201d I retort, grinning as I stare up at the ceiling. His walls are painted black, which makes his room always seem dark even when it\u2019s midday. There are sketches all over his wall of images and people that mean something to him or that have inspired him in one way or another. But there\u2019s not one of me. The one he\u2019s drawing right now is the first one he\u2019s ever done of me. Why, I have no idea. I\u2019ve known him for a few years, but he\u2019s never asked to draw me before. Until this morning.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you drawing me again?\u201d I ask, wiggling my nose, trying to get the itch to go away.</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cIt just seemed like it was time.\u201d</p><p>Music is playing in the background and I start to sing along, giving up on trying to figure out what he\u2019s really thinking.</p><p>\u201cYou know how you get a song stuck in your head?\u201d he says, letting out a quiet breath. \u201cAnd no matter how hard you try, it just keeps playing over and over again until finally you just have to start singing it aloud.\u201d</p><p>I smile as I finish the set of lyrics. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s why I\u2019m drawing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I was stuck in your head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about you,\u201d he says, and I pretty much stop breathing. \u201cIt\u2019s actually been that way for a while now.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m wary to ask, but I have to know. \u201cIs that a good thing or a bad thing? Because sometimes when a song gets stuck in my head it can get kind of annoying.\u201d</p><p>He pauses and I wait for him to start teasing me and make a joke about me being a pain in his ass. But he doesn\u2019t say anything, and the sound of the pencil scratching against the paper stops. I want to tip my chin down so I can see what he\u2019s doing, but I\u2019m too nervous, so I lie there, singing under my breath.</p><p>Seconds later, he\u2019s climbing over me with a small, but diffident smile on his face. \u201cIt\u2019s not annoying at all.\u201d He props an arm on each side of my head and positions his body over me. I don\u2019t move, don\u2019t breathe, and I\u2019m pretty sure my heart stops beating. \u201cYou\u2019re like my favorite song, Nova. The one that I never want to forget. That I want to play over and over again.\u201d</p><p>I try not to grin because it sounds like a line. But Landon\u2019s never been the kind of guy to feed girls cheesy pickup lines. In fact, he hardly talks to girls except me, and the fact that he\u2019s using a music analogy says how much he knows me. \u201cWould you put me on repeat?\u201d I ask like a dork, because he\u2019s too close and it\u2019s making me nervous and stupid, apparently.</p><p>He bites at his bottom lip, confining a smile. \u201cI do... you\u2019re always in my head...\u201d He leans toward me, and I wonder if this is the moment when he\u2019s finally going to kiss me, instead of almost kiss me. \u201cAlways....\u201d Right before our lips touch, I detect a flash of sadness in his eyes, heavier than what\u2019s normally there, but it vanishes the instant our lips come into contact.</p><p>I suck in a slow, shaky breath as warmth spreads throughout my body and his tongue slips over mine. He tastes like spices I\u2019ve never dared taste before. I know it\u2019s not his first kiss, but he knows it\u2019s mine. I wonder what he thinks about me. Why he\u2019s kissing me. I\u2019m thinking a lot of things.</p><p>\u201cNova,\u201d he whispers, and I realize his lips are no longer touching but hovering over mine, his breath warm against my skin. \u201cDo you want me to stop?\u201d he asks.</p><p>My chest is heaving and every time it rises up, it brushes against his. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He wets his lips with his tongue, and then runs his eyes over me, shifting his weight to the side so he can brush my hair out of my eyes. \u201cRelax,\u201d he says, and when I nod, he reconnects his mouth to mine.</p><p>I try to do what he says and relax, but when his tongue enters my mouth again, I start to panic, wondering if I\u2019m doing everything right. But the longer his tongue massages mine, the more my muscles start to unravel. I become a little daring and bite his lip, which he seems to like, because he shudders. My hands are still lying motionlessly at the side of me, but his are all over me, feeling my sides, my waist, my hips. His fingers start to sneak underneath the bottom of my dress and I tense, deliberating whether I should tell him to stop. But as I search for a reason why, I realize there\u2019s not one and that I want him to touch me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I loosen up and move my hands up to his chest, taking the opportunity to feel the lines of his lean muscles. His fingers graze the bottom of my panties, and for a second the weight of him falls against me. I arch my body into his, knowing that our friendship that once existed is no more, but I don\u2019t care. I want this\u2014want him.</p><p>Our slow kiss starts to heat up as his tongue explores the inside of my mouth, and then I gasp for air as he slowly slips a finger inside me.</p><p>\u201cI should stop, right?\u201d he pants, pulling back for a minute to look me in the eyes.</p><p>I blink through the amazing feelings developing inside my body, trying to focus on his beautiful face and the intensity in his eyes, but I\u2019m losing touch with reality. \u201cNo...,\u201d I manage to get out as my neck curves and my head tips back.</p> <p>He listens to me, touching me more and making me feel things I only ever imagined. He kisses me all the way through it until my body can no longer take it and he has to stop, otherwise I\u2019d pass out from lack of oxygen. His eyes are glossy as he encircles his arm around my waist, and he pulls me with him as he rolls onto his back. I rest my head on his chest, my eyes wide at the implausibility of what just happened.</p><p>I drape my arm over his stomach as he plays with my hair. \u201cSo am I still stuck in your head?\u201d I say and then roll my eyes at myself.</p><p>His fingers stop combing through my hair and he sketches a line down to my cheek to my jawline, where he hooks a finger underneath my chin and tips my chin up so I meet his eyes. \u201cYes. In fact, I think it\u2019s worse.\u201d He says it like he\u2019s disappointed, almost as if he was hoping that I wouldn\u2019t be, and it makes me sad. I\u2019m about to ask why he looks so upset, but then he dips his mouth to mine and starts kissing me again, and just like that I forget about everything.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>Nova</p> <p>June 5, Day 17 of Summer Break</p><p>The feisty tune of \u201cLast Resort\u201d by Papa Roach plays in the background, but I have it turned down low so it won\u2019t drown out my words. The blinds are shut, blocking out the morning sunlight, and my hair hangs to my shoulders, still damp from the shower I just took. The computer has been recording for about five minutes, but I haven\u2019t said a word. I\u2019ve gotten up a few times and paced my floor, trying to get the thoughts in my head to connect and form coherent sentences. I wonder if that\u2019s what Landon did before he made his video... I wonder if he planned it out.</p><p>Finally, I decide there shouldn\u2019t be any preplanning, and plop down in the chair. I\u2019m a little restless as I slant the screen and then tuck my leg under my butt to boost myself up, and then let the first sentence that pops into my head barrel out of my mouth, despite my initial instinct to censor. \u201cOkay, so it\u2019s been a little over two weeks since I got home from college and the dreams and memories of...\u201d I attempt, but then trail off, knowing I\u2019m going to have to say his name, even if I don\u2019t want to. It\u2019s strange, though, talking about him, while looking at myself on the screen of the computer. I can see how just the thought of uttering his name aloud makes my eyes go wide and my pupils shrink, like I\u2019ve suddenly been possessed by a distant memory. I take a deep breath, then another, running my fingers through my hair, and sweeping it out of my face. \u201cLandon...\u201d My eyes enlarge. What will people think if they ever watch this? What will they wonder about me and how I saw myself? \u201cThe dreams about him are more intense than they\u2019ve ever been,\u201d I say. \u201cPart of me wants to find a way to shut them off, but part of me wants to hold on to them\u2014hold on to him... forever.\u201d</p><p>I cross my arms on the desk, lean closer to the screen, and examine my eyes, noting the vastness in my pupils, circled by a slender blue ring. \u201cWhen I look at myself, everything inside me pretty much screams to stop thinking about him and to turn off the memories... and I try to count through them... like it\u2019s that simple... but it\u2019s not.\u201d I blow out a breath, gathering my hair behind my head. \u201cI just wish I could figure out a way to know what he was thinking... somehow track things back to why he gave up so easily... why he left me... why I couldn\u2019t see where he was headed.\u201d I bite at my fingernail. \u201cOr maybe I could and I was just in denial... Was that the kind of person that I was? One who denies what\u2019s in front of her?\u201d My voice drops off at the end as the blunt honesty escapes my mouth. I don\u2019t want to hear it or think about it anymore, so I shut the computer down, no longer wanting to look at myself.</p><p>Later that day, Delilah and I are hanging out in my room. The blinds are open and the sunlight flows inside, making the air stifling, even though I have a fan on full blast. I\u2019m sifting through some of my video clips, trying to figure out what the hell the purpose is, besides watching me babble about pointless nonsense that doesn\u2019t really make sense. Am I trying to understand myself? Who I am? Or am I trying to understand Landon? Life? Death? What he was thinking in his final moments, and why did he decide to sit down and record it?</p><p>Why do I always have so many fucking questions in my head?</p> <p>\u201cWe should go to that concert down in Fairfield at the end of July. Wouldn\u2019t that be fun? To feed your music addiction,\u201d Delilah says as she sifts through a stack of CDs on my shelf and pulls a few out. She\u2019s wearing a short red dress that matches her red-stained lips and is only a couple of shades darker than her hair. \u201cAnd why do you have these still? No one listens to CDs anymore.\u201d</p><p>I take them from her hand and set them down on my computer desk in an orderly, alphabetized stack: Blink-182 to Taking Back Sunday. \u201cLandon gave them to me,\u201d I say and then keep talking to avoid going down that road with her. I close one of my video files down and try to ignore the file marked \u201cLandon\u2019s\u201d as I open another video clip of mine. \u201cAnd what concert? I don\u2019t remember hearing about one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you live in your own little crazy Nova Land.\u201d She crosses her eyes and circles her finger around her temple, and then she plops down on my bed and tucks her hands underneath her legs. \u201cIt\u2019s been advertised all over town and I\u2019ve mentioned it a few times. It\u2019s just a bunch of indie bands. But it\u2019s going to be like a weeklong event or something.\u201d</p><p>I mull over the idea of going to a concert. As much as I love music and used to love going to concerts, I don\u2019t feel like going to them anymore. There\u2019s too much connection to Landon with them, and there\u2019d be a lot of noise and a lot of people and a lot of unfamiliarity, which would make it hard to keep track of everything around me. Plus, if it\u2019s a weeklong concert, my morning routine would be wrecked and my anxiety would probably go through the roof, unstable, out of control. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m up for a concert, Delilah, or if I\u2019ll have time.\u201d I move the cursor across the screen to click on another video file. \u201cI think I might enroll in some summer classes... maybe a film one or something.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head as she shoves to her feet, then she stomps over to the computer and hammers her thumb against the off button on the tower. \u201cNo way. We made a pact not to do classes this summer. Besides\u2014\u201d she taps her finger on the computer screen \u201c\u2014you already got your own little film lesson going on here. Although I don\u2019t get why. You\u2019ve never really been into filming before, at least not to the point where you did it for fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still trying to figure out what the point is, too.\u201d Sighing, I rotate the chair around to face her and change the subject. \u201cI know we said no classes, but I need a distraction.\u201d</p><p>She plants her hands on her hips and narrows her eyes at me. \u201cFrom what?\u201d</p><p>I shrug and put my hand over the scar on my wrist. \u201cThis town... my own head. Life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that going to be hard, since we\u2019re here?\u201d She points out the window at the undersized, nearly identical houses that line the street. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know what to tell you about escaping your own head or life other than you could get high.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you being serious right now?\u201d I ask. I\u2019ve never smoked weed myself. Landon did though... always smoking it, all the time... and telling me I shouldn\u2019t. I always just let it be, because I was never really the kind of person who wanted to. Now, though... I\u2019m not really sure who I am. And I want to find out just what kind of person I am. Do I really like music anymore, or is my love for it gone? Do I really like making videos? Would I like getting high?</p><p>She shrugs, her expression unreadable. \u201cI\u2019m not saying to do it, only that you could do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you still do it? Smoke weed, I mean.\u201d.</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cI told you I stopped when we went to college.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure if I believe her. We lived in the same dorm and everything, and I saw her pretty much every day, but she also went out a lot more than I did, mainly because I hate going to new places and the ones she loved to go to were unpredictable, rowdy, loud, head spinning.</p><p>She flops down on my bed, which is overflowing with purple and black throw pillows, and the mattress bounces beneath her. \u201cNova, I love you to death\u2014I really do\u2014but you are the saddest person I\u2019ve ever met and sometimes... sometimes I think you almost are this way on purpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sad all the time, am I?\u201d I ask. She doesn\u2019t answer but only offers me a sympathetic look. I stretch my legs out and stare down at my feet. I have flip-flops on, and the scar where I cut my foot open the day I found Landon shows. It happened when I fell down on the floor. My foot caught on the bottom of his bookshelf, and it scraped the entire layer of skin off. It probably hurt, but the shock numbed it. I didn\u2019t even scream. I just lay there... looking at him... like that until... My head pounds and blood roars in my eardrums as images clip the inside of my skull. Darkness, the soft sound of music... how pale his skin looked even in daybreak...</p><p>One... two... three... I start counting the dark threads of fabric on the carpet, forcing the thought from my head. Four... five... six...</p><p>\u201cNova, what the hell.\u201d Delilah waves her hand in front of my face and I flinch, breaking the steady pattern of numbers in my head. \u201cYou\u2019re totally spacing out on me.\u201d</p><p>I inhale, then progressively free the breath from my lungs, and my bangs drift to the side of my face. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>She vacillates, bobbing her head from side to side, and then she seizes my hand and hauls me to my feet. \u201cWe are so getting out of here.\u201d</p><p>She leads me toward my bedroom door, and I rush to keep up with her. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>She yanks open the door and tugs me out into the hall, pulling me toward the front door. \u201cAnywhere but here.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t like that she doesn\u2019t have a destination, and my pulse soars as we step outside and head toward her truck. I suddenly wish I had a camera in my hand, because it seems like it would be a lot more calming watching myself wander into the unknown, through the lens, because it wouldn\u2019t seem so real. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It\u2019s hot and I\u2019m wearing cutoffs and a thin black tank top. My hair is a little tangled, and I only have eyeliner and mascara on, which is melting from the heat. \u201cI\u2019m not dressed to go anywhere,\u201d I protest, as she swings open the front gate.</p><p>She glances over her shoulder and inspects my outfit and hair. \u201cYou look great. You always do.\u201d She stops when we arrive at her single-cab truck parked in front of the garage. She lets go of my hand and positions herself in front of me. \u201cLook, when I first met you, you were seriously so sad, and I was kind of terrified of you. But then I got to know you, and you know what? My opinion changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly because Ms. Kenzingly forced us to work on that final project together.\u201d I smile at the memory of our first awkward introduction. She was the pretty, outgoing girl who sometimes got into trouble, and I was the depressed, weird girl who used to date Landon. It had been four weeks since I\u2019d found him in his room, and I was still the one everyone was afraid of, because I saw things no one wants to admit exists. \u201cGod, I can only image how hard it was trying to get me to even talk to you.\u201d</p><p>She smiles, too, but it\u2019s shadowed by a stern look. \u201cYeah, and to this day I\u2019m so glad I managed to get you to say something, even though it was \u2018Yes, I think so,\u2019 because it opened the door for our friendship.\u201d She pauses, rubbing her lips together as she shields her eyes from the sunlight with her hand. \u201cBut it was hard, you know, being your friend, because you never told me the truth about what was going on in that head of yours, but at college you seemed a little better. Not great, but better.\u201d She waves her hand in front of me and blows out an exasperated breath. \u201cBut we\u2019ve been back for over a couple of weeks now and you\u2019re getting sadder, if that\u2019s even possible.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible,\u201d I say, leaning back against the truck door. \u201cIt really is.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s quiet for a while and then she takes my hands in hers. \u201cCan we just go somewhere for a while? Escape or something. Do something crazy and unexpected. We could go hang out at Dylan\u2019s tonight and just relax.\u201d</p><p>Crazy and unexpected? I start counting the rocks under my feet but there are too many. \u201cAre we just escaping from my sadness? Or from your mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth,\u201d she says simply, giving the top of my hand a pat.</p><p>I keep trying to count the rocks, but more and more appear in my vision, and finally it becomes overwhelming and I give up. Throwing my hands in the air, I decide to try and not be sad for the day. Try to survive. \u201cOkay,\u201d</p> <p>She jumps up and down, clapping her hands. \u201cThank you, Nova.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d I open the truck door and hop into the seat, feeling as though I\u2019ve failed because the rocks remain uncounted. \u201cBut you really don\u2019t need to be thanking me. I didn\u2019t do anything, you crazy woman.\u201d I shut the door and she skips around to the other side.</p><p>\u201cYes, you did.\u201d She smiles as she climbs into the driver\u2019s seat, then turns on the ignition. \u201cYou decided to be happy.\u201d</p><p>I keep quiet and let myself drown in my thoughts, knowing that\u2019s not what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019ll probably never truly be happy again, no matter how much I want to, because no matter what, Landon will always be gone and I\u2019ll still be here.</p><p>Alone.</p><p>We end up stopping at the local ice cream parlor, because Delilah says that some sugar in my system will cheer me up. It was what my dad used to say all the time: Eat some candy and you\u2019ll feel better. My mom hated it and would always put something healthy in my hand, like an apple or a carrot, then when she\u2019d turn away, my dad would steal it and wink at me as he handed me a sucker or a candy bar.</p> <p>I miss him so bad. His life ended way too soon, but unlike Landon\u2019s, I couldn\u2019t have prevented it. He had a heart condition he didn\u2019t know about until it was too late, and there was nothing I could have done to help him. Still, it had been horrible to watch... him lying on the ground helpless and afraid, and there was nothing I could do but watch his life leave him. I never thought I\u2019d be the same again, and then Landon came along and it felt like he understood me and he gave me a reason to smile again. But then he left me, too, out of choice, something I still can\u2019t figure out, even after a goddamn year. And now I\u2019m here, walking around, half the time feeling like a zombie with no real direction, lost and lonely, and everything I felt when my dad died has multiplied.</p><p>God, what the fuck? Why did you do it? Why did you leave me here? You can\u2019t leave me here.</p><p>I\u2019m sitting in one of the booths, watching a wind chime outside twirl in the light summer breeze as I stir the bowl of cookie dough ice cream in front of me. The chime is made of thin clear strings and shimmering pieces of aqua and teal sea glass that magically reflect the sunlight every time it hits them. There\u2019s some cheesy \u201990s music playing, and I\u2019m totally zoning in my thoughts while Delilah tries to get the cashier guy to give her more maraschino cherries.</p><p>I hear the door\u2019s bell ding as someone walks inside, and my gaze instinctively drifts from the chime to my barely touched bowl of ice cream, which is now melted and liquefied. Then I hear Delilah say something really loud, and I reel around in the booth and look toward the front counter. Dylan, Tristan, and Quinton are standing beside her, and she already has her arms and lips fastened on Dylan, who\u2019s cupping her ass as he lifts her up. The cashier guy seems really uncomfortable by their public display of affection and walks back to the stocking room.</p><p>Tristan starts laughing at something on the order board and then he playfully slaps Quinton in the stomach. Quinton gives him a shove, a smile forming at his lips, but his eyes are still hued with sorrow. Tristan stumbles to the side, nearly crashing into an oblivious Dylan and Delilah, then he regains his balance and leans in to say something to Quinton. When he catches sight of me, he gives me a little smile and wave.</p><p>I return the wave and then my hand falls to the table as Quinton looks over at me. Biting his bottom lip, he seems uneasy as he raises his hand and waves at me. I return the wave with a tight smile, then sighing I turn back to my sad little melted bowl of ice cream.</p><p>Quinton starts to head over, even though he looks like it\u2019s the last thing he wants to be doing. His hands are stuffed in the pockets of his faded jeans, and there\u2019s a small hole in the bottom of his black T-shirt. It looks like there\u2019s dirt or some kind of shavings in his hair, and he\u2019s got black smudges tracking up his arms. The closer he gets, the quicker I count, until the numbers in my head are blurred together and suddenly I can\u2019t see a path. My adrenaline surges, and I feel overwhelmed. I need to find a path again, something to concentrate on, something I can control and keep track of.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he says when he arrives at my table, and the sound of his voice immediately begins to slow down my pulse.</p> <p>\u201cHey,\u201d I reply, stirring my melted ice cream as I tip my chin up, my gaze gradually scrolling up his body.</p><p>Silence builds between us, but a real, comfortable silence, just like when I spent time with Landon. But he\u2019s not Landon.</p><p>\u201cSo rumor has it that you\u2019re a music junkie,\u201d he finally says, scooting into the seat across from mine. \u201cAnd that you play the piano and the drums.\u201d</p><p>I nod, internally cringing at the mention of drums, the instrument I loved most, but can longer even contemplate playing without it hurting every inch of my mind and soul. \u201cWho told you that? Tristan?\u201d</p><p>His glances at Tristan, who\u2019s up at the counter, rambling off an order to the cashier guy. \u201cYeah, he did the other day, after you left our house.\u201d</p><p>I notice the smell of his cologne, laced with a hint of smoke, and I hate to admit it, but I kind of like it, even though it doesn\u2019t remind me of Landon in any way. His eyes are glossy like caramel, and he keeps looking at my melted bowl of gooey ice cream like it\u2019s the most fascinating thing in the world. \u201cOkay... why were you guys talking about me?\u201d</p><p>He glances up from the ice cream, blinking his bloodshot eyes. \u201cBecause I asked him about you.\u201d He bites his lip after he says it, like he wants to retract his statement.</p><p>\u201cWell, that doesn\u2019t seem fair,\u201d I say, trying to keep the conversation effortless. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about you.\u201d</p><p>He flops back in his seat, putting his hands behind his head with his elbows sticking out as he gazes through the window. \u201cThere\u2019s not much to know.\u201d</p><p>I shut my eyes, telling myself to get up and walk away, because it feels wrong. But when I open them again, he\u2019s looking directly at me, and I can\u2019t help myself. I need to understand him, because in a weird, distorted way I feel like understanding him might help me understand Landon a little better, if I can get deep enough.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an artist,\u201d I say straightforwardly as I set the spoon down on the table.</p><p>His arms drift to his lap and he looks so mystified that it momentarily eliminates the pain in his eyes. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>I inch my hand across the table, trying to keep my fingers steady as I touch a splotch of charcoal on his forearm. \u201cBecause of these.\u201d</p><p>He glances down at my fingers on his arm, unnerved. \u201cYeah, but most people would think it was grease or something.\u201d</p><p>I wonder if he knows\u2014if Tristan told him about Landon. \u201cI\u2019m just that good.\u201d I sink back in the booth, fold my arms, and chew on my bottom lip, fighting back a smile.</p><p>Curiosity crosses his face. \u201cWell, I guess so.\u201d He waits for me to elaborate, but I don\u2019t. I\u2019m kind of enjoying mystifying him.</p><p>I fiddle with the leather band bracelets on my wrists. \u201cWhere did you move from?\u201d</p><p>His expression sinks as he looks back to the window. \u201cSeattle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeattle... how far is that from here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe plane ride was a little over an hour.\u201d He thrums his fingers on the table, his shoulders stiffening as he grows more uncomfortable. \u201cSo Dylan said Delilah mentioned a concert, and I guess they want to go.\u201d He changes the subject, just like Landon used to do when he\u2019d get uncomfortable with a topic.</p><p>\u201cYeah, she was saying something to me about it earlier,\u201d I say, picking up the spoon. I want to ask him more about why he came here, but I can\u2019t seem to work up the nerve to press for information. I don\u2019t know him, and generally when people don\u2019t want to talk about something it\u2019s hard to get it out of them. That was always the problem with Landon. He never wanted to talk. And I always let him get away with it. \u201cI\u2019m not a fan of concerts anymore, though.\u201d</p><p>His head slants to the side as he studies me. \u201cYou\u2019re a fan of music, you play the drums and piano, but you don\u2019t like concerts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to,\u201d I clarify as I start to stir the ice cream again. \u201cBut now... I don\u2019t know, they\u2019re too noisy.\u201d Chaotic, disorganized, sporadic.</p><p>\u201cMusic in general is noisy.\u201d He\u2019s amused by me, and for a moment the craziness inside my head is worth it.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but at concerts the crowd is, too.\u201d I know I sound insane, but I can\u2019t explain further without explaining all of me. I bring the spoon to my mouth and slurp the ice cream off it, pulling a face when I realize how warm it is. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He laughs at me as I gag, and it makes me smile a little because happiness looks so beautiful on his face. \u201cThat bad, huh?\u201d he asks, and I nod. Sliding his hands across the table, his fingers seek the bowl. \u201cMind if I try it?\u201d</p><p>I gesture at the melted bowl of goo. \u201cBe my guest.\u201d</p><p>He looks way too happy to be receiving my melted, secondhand ice cream as he grabs the bowl, and relaxes back in the booth, scooping up a spoonful. \u201cBottoms up,\u201d he says and elevates the spoon to his lips. I\u2019m fascinated by the way he sucks it off the plastic spoon, deliberately, like he\u2019s savoring every taste of it. A little drips from his mouth and trickles down his lip, and his tongue slides out of his mouth to lick it off, and for a second I picture myself behind a camera, recording the movements of his lips and throat.</p><p>Then he takes another large bite, nearly devouring it, and I scrunch my nose. I never was a fan of melted ice cream, but he might be because he\u2019s stoned. Landon would sometimes get these weird cravings when he was high, like for caramel ice cream topping straight out of the jar or cherries on a peanut butter sandwich. \u201cSo how is it?\u201d</p> <p>He stares up at the ceiling thoughtfully, then takes another bite. \u201cDelicious, but I\u2019ve always kind of had a thing for melted ice cream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s gross,\u201d I divulge, crossing my arms on the table. \u201cI like it right out of the freezer when it\u2019s so frozen you have to stab the spoon into it.\u201d</p><p>He puts another spoonful into his mouth and then looks at me with a puzzled, amused expression as he points the plastic spoon at me. \u201cYou\u2019re an interesting person, Nova, which by the way can I say is my favorite car.\u201d His smile is adorable, but he\u2019s hitting a sensitive subject. Not just with the mention of the car, but with me. Landon use to call me interesting\u2014or quirky\u2014instead of weird like everyone else.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not weird,\u201d Landon had said once when I\u2019d came home from school upset after Nina Ramaldy told me I was a freak who no one would ever want or understand. \u201cYou\u2019re interesting and...\u201d He\u2019d tapped the end of his pencil on his chin. \u201cEntertaining.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a good thing?\u201d I\u2019d questioned doubtfully.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful thing, Nova,\u201d he\u2019d replied with one of his rare smiles. \u201cIt\u2019d suck if you were normal. You\u2019d be no fun.\u201d</p><p>I shake the memory away and concentrate on Quinton and his honey-brown eyes. \u201cAre you seriously going to eat all that melted ice cream?\u201d</p><p>He puts another spoon full into his mouth and some of it drips down the back of his hand. \u201cYou know, melted or not, ice cream is just ice cream.\u201d He licks the back of his hand, and it makes me laugh.</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d I disagree. \u201cIce cream isn\u2019t meant to be warm.\u201d</p><p>He hesitantly stares down into the bowl as he scrapes the spoon around the edge, then peers up at me. \u201cHere.\u201d He moves the spoon toward me, and there\u2019s a large chunk of cookie dough in it with very little ice cream. \u201cTry this part. It\u2019s not so bad.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and wrinkle my nose. \u201cNo thanks. You can eat it.\u201d</p> <p>He tries to look annoyed, giving me a cold, hard stare, but it\u2019s more humorous than anything. \u201cNova, you have to have some of it; otherwise, I\u2019m going to go home feeling guilty for eating all of your ice cream.\u201d</p><p>I wonder if he\u2019s this entertaining when he\u2019s not buzzed\u2014I wonder if I\u2019ll ever get to find out. I over dramatically sigh, pretending it\u2019s a burden, gather my hair behind my head and lean over the table. He meets me halfway and puts the spoon into my mouth, licking his lips to suppress a grin as I suck the chunk of dough into my mouth. Sitting back, I chew on it.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he says as he takes another bite himself, his eyes lingering on my mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s not so bad without the melted ice cream on it, right?\u201d</p><p>I swallow the dough and let go of my hair. \u201cNo, it\u2019s worse,\u201d I lie, biting my bottom lip to keep from laughing.</p><p>He licks some ice cream off the bottom of his lip and I notice him eyeing my mouth again. For a second I wonder what his lips would taste like after he\u2019s eaten all that ice cream, but then guilt creeps over me as I picture Landon and his lips and how he was the only guy I\u2019d ever really wanted to kiss. The calm bubble that discreetly formed around us pops, and I start counting the tiles on the floor around our table, searching for an excuse to get up. Then a shadow casts itself over the table.</p><p>I glance up and I\u2019m relieved to find Delilah standing next to the table. She has a cone in her hand, along with a napkin. \u201cHey,\u201d I say to her.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she replies, giving me a questioning look, then her eyes wander to Quinton as she sticks out her hand. \u201cHi, we haven\u2019t really met yet. I\u2019m Delilah.\u201d</p><p>Quinton sets the bowl of ice cream down on the table, wipes his hands off on the front of his shirt, and shakes her hand. \u201cQuinton.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d she says, letting go of his hand. There\u2019s something in her tone\u2014insinuation, maybe\u2014that makes me wonder if she knows something about him. \u201cYou\u2019re from Seattle, right?\u201d</p><p>His hands twitch as he balls them up and folds his arms on the table. \u201cYeah.\u201d His fists are so tight his knuckles are turning white and I wonder what he left back in Seattle. Or maybe who. He clears his throat and then scoots to the edge of the booth. \u201cI have to go.\u201d He gets up, swings around Delilah, and then hurries for the door.</p><p>Delilah and I watch him as he shoves the door open, walks outside, and then dashes down the sidewalk with his head tucked down. Seeing him like that, so upset and disheartened, brings up a memory I\u2019d almost forgotten.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk right now,\u201d Landon had said to me once, and then he\u2019d walked away, leaving me standing in the middle of the yard, totally confused because I\u2019d only asked him where he wanted to go to college and if he\u2019d still want to be with me. After I thought about it for a few minutes, though, I realized how huge the question was and how silly I was for putting it on him, so I didn\u2019t chase after him. I wished I had, though. I wished I had more than anything. Maybe if I would have chased him down and forced him to talk, things would have ended differently\u2014maybe things would have never ended at all.</p><p>I start to slide to the edge of the booth, seriously contemplating chasing Quinton down, even though I don\u2019t know him.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Delilah asks as she sits down in the booth, stopping me from sliding out, and licks the top of her vanilla ice cream cone. \u201cDon\u2019t chase after him.\u201d</p><p>I inch back inside the booth, slip my flip-flop off, and tuck my foot under my leg. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNova, you barely know him,\u201d she says. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s great to see you smiling like that, but you should probably learn more about him before you go chasing him down.\u201d</p><p>My shoulders slump as I reach across the table for the bowl of ice cream. \u201cHe looks so sad.\u201d I frown at the empty bowl. \u201cLike really sad. I wonder why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do you,\u201d she remarks, licking the top of her cone. She keeps licking and slurping on it and it starts to drive me nuts. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to tell you something about him, and then I\u2019m going to let you decide whether you want to go there or not, because you\u2019ve been through a lot, and you deserve to know what you\u2019re getting into before you dive in.\u201d</p><p>Deserve? Who\u2019s to decide what I deserve? I shove the bowl to the side and lean forward, crossing my arms. \u201cYou\u2019re making me worry. Is there... is there something wrong with him? Quinton, I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe drums her fingers on the table. \u201cSort of.\u201d</p><p>I swallow the lump in my throat, fleetingly glancing at Tristan and Dylan over at the counter, chatting it up with the cashier guy. They look so happy and they make it look so easy. I fix my gaze back on Delilah. \u201cPlease just tell me.\u201d</p><p>She dabs some ice cream off her lips with a napkin and starts to open her mouth, when Dylan strolls up to our table.</p><p>\u201cHey, babe,\u201d Dylan says over cheerfully as he puts his arms around Delilah. He has dirt on his cheek, and he smells like beer and cigarettes. He kisses the top of her head and glances up at me. \u201cHey, Nova.\u201d His eyes travel to the empty seat across from me. \u201cWhere\u2019d Quinton go?\u201d</p><p>I point over my shoulder at the window. \u201cHe left.\u201d I eye Delilah over, wanting to hear what she has to say about Quinton, but she shrugs, obviously not wanting to talk about it in front of Dylan.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d he go?\u201d Dylan asks as he shovels up a spoonful from the ridiculously large bowl of ice cream he\u2019s holding.</p><p>\u201cHe probably just needed to get some air.\u201d Tristan struts up to the table carrying a bowl of ice cream that\u2019s piled with marshmallows. \u201cHe does that sometimes.\u201d</p><p>I note the slight annoyance in Tristan\u2019s tone. \u201cIs he okay?\u201d I ask. \u201cMaybe someone should go check on him.\u201d</p><p>Tristan stares at his ice cream, then his eyebrows elevate. \u201cHe\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>Something\u2019s up and the longer no one says anything, the more awkward things get. Finally Dylan and Tristan sit down in the opposite seat and start chatting about the concert. Delilah keeps saying we\u2019re going to go, even though I said no earlier. I\u2019m too distracted to argue, though. I can\u2019t stop thinking about how similar Landon and Quinton are, and the longer I compare them, the more I realize I should have chased Quinton down, just like I should have done with Landon, and I make a silent vow to do better this time, no matter what it takes.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>Quinton</p><p>I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m running away from my feelings, the past, or Nova. Probably the combination of all three.</p><p>I was sitting there in a place that looks like it\u2019s straight out of Willy Wonka\u2019s Chocolate Factory, actually talking to Nova about fucking ice cream, and I have this tone in my voice, the one I used to use on Lexi, when I was trying to charm her. And Nova is smiling at me and I can tell she doesn\u2019t smile that often by how hard it is for her. It\u2019s like she wants to be sad, which makes me want to make her happy, maybe then I could make up for some of the sadness I put in the world.</p><p>Then her friend Delilah comes up to the booth and starts asking me about Seattle. Unlike Nova, she seems determined to get my past out of me. In fact, I think she already knows about it, but she wants to actually hear me say it. Even though I\u2019m pretty much ripped out of my mind, the panic and the guilt gets to me as I think of Lexi and the promise I made to her. The need to escape gets to me, and I\u2019m up and out the door, running away from my problems.</p><p>I walk all the way back to the trailer park, which is about three miles, and I\u2019m freaking thirsty as hell and tired. After I drink a beer and smoke a bowl, I pass out on the bed and pretty much stay that way for the next few weeks, drifting in and out of reality. Somehow, in the midst of my dazedness, Nikki and I end up in my room, screwing multiple times, even though I barely remember her coming into the room. Then she lays in my bed and starts yammering about what color she should dye her hair. I keep blinking at her, wishing she\u2019d disappear, and finally, Tristan comes in, kicks her out, and then steals his pipe back. Somewhere along the line, I start to lose my buzz, finally diving to rock bottom. I\u2019m exhausted, and even thinking feels like a huge fucking project, but I need to find a job because I\u2019m running out of money and weed and I need to start paying rent. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I wasn\u2019t always this way. I use to be responsible. In fact, it was something my mom always took pride in when she was bragging to her friends. I was supposed to go to a good college, probably with Lexi, where we\u2019d date until we graduated, then we\u2019d get married and start our lives together. At least that was the plan. But that plan\u2019s no longer possible, and even a plan for a day seems pretty much out of my reach.</p><p>June 28, Day 40 if Summer Break</p><p>I sit up in bed and swing my legs over the edge, stretching my arms above my head when someone knocks on the door. \u201cCome in,\u201d I call out, thinking it\u2019s probably Tristan coming to lecture me again about getting out of bed.</p><p>But when the door opens up, Nova is on the other side. Her hair is pulled up, and wisps frame her face. She\u2019s wearing a short black dress with red stripes and slender straps that show off her bare shoulders and collarbone. There\u2019s black liner framing her blue eyes, and her full lips look glossy. But other than that I don\u2019t think she\u2019s wearing any makeup, because I can still see the freckles on her nose.</p> <p>She stares at my bare chest as she clutches her phone in her hand, and I\u2019m suddenly very hyperaware that I\u2019m only in my boxers. She can see the nasty scar on my chest, leftover from the accident that nearly ripped me in half, both mentally and physically, and the tattoos on my bicep of everyone I killed that day. Her cheeks flush, but surprisingly she doesn\u2019t leave the room. She points over her shoulder at the hallway. \u201cI came here with Delilah, and Dylan said that you\u2019d been back here sleeping for a quite a while and that I needed to come wake you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did?\u201d I shake my head. I don\u2019t know much about Dylan, but the longer I stay here, the more I realize that he seems to like starting trouble. I stand up and head to my dresser, working to put a smile on my face. \u201cAll right, you did your job. I\u2019m up.\u201d</p><p>She nods and I expect her to leave, but she dithers in the doorway. Then, looking nervous as shit, she takes a deep breath, steps over the threshold into my room, and starts wandering around. There are clothes and sketches all over the floor, the dresser, and the bed. She assesses each one closely, and I squirm uncomfortably as I take a shirt out of my dresser.</p><p>She stops at my bed and eyes the drawing I made back in high school of Lexi wearing nothing but her underwear and bra. I wonder what she\u2019s thinking. If she\u2019s offended? Do I care if she is?</p><p>Her head tips to the side as she reaches out to pick it up, and I open my mouth to tell her not to touch it because it feels wrong somehow, seeing Lexi\u2019s picture in another girl\u2019s hand. But then she decides against it, pulling her hand away.</p> <p>She glances over her shoulder at me. \u201cShe\u2019s pretty.\u201d</p><p>I nod, swallowing the lump in my throat, and then slip my shirt over my head. \u201cYeah, she was.\u201d</p><p>Her lips part a little when I say was, which I didn\u2019t mean to say. In fact, I wish I could take it back. Luckily, Nova seems to be understanding and she steps up to my wall and starts studying a drawing I made of vines weaving around a bag of Skittles. I made it when I decided to take a hit of acid, because weed wasn\u2019t doing anything for the internal agony. It turned out to be a very bad idea and did nothing for numbing my emotions, instead bringing out a very dark, almost insane side of me.</p><p>\u201cThis one\u2019s interesting,\u201d she muses, glancing at me. \u201cWhat were you thinking when you drew it?\u201d</p><p>I reach for a pair of jeans in the top drawer of the banged-up dresser that only has two of the four drawers. \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t remember.\u201d I unfold the jeans and transfer my weight to one leg so I can slip them on. \u201cI think it had something to do with the fact that I\u2019d smoked a lot of weed and did... other stuff, and then fell in a rosebush that day and went home and ate some Skittles.\u201d</p><p>She laughs, looking bewildered, and I find myself smiling, too. \u201cDo you do that a lot?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat? Fall into rosebushes? Or eat Skittles?\u201d I ask, zipping up my jeans.</p><p>She sucks her bottom lip in between her teeth, and I catch her gaze flicking to my hands as I button up my jeans, which makes me wonder what she\u2019s thinking about. \u201cNo, do you smoke weed a lot? I\u2019m just curious.\u201d</p><p>The light mood she created plummets, and I feel deflated. \u201cYeah,\u201d I say truthfully, knowing it\u2019s probably going to scare her off.</p><p>She glances around at some of the drawings, then holding her dress in place, she crouches down to get a closer look at one. \u201cYeah, so do Dylan and Tristan, but you probably know that since you live with them.\u201d</p><p>I grab my wallet off the dresser. \u201cYeah, I guess.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure what Dylan\u2019s and Tristan\u2019s reasons are for smoking an abundance of weed; whether Tristan does it just because or if it\u2019s how he deals with the death of his sister, Ryder. All I know is that I do it to deaden the pain inside me. It was something I discovered after countless therapy sessions, prescriptions, and trying to draw my way through my inner turmoil. Nothing was working, and one day, while I was hanging out with the only friend I had left, he took out a joint. I\u2019d never tried pot before\u2014never cared to. But then I realized that I really didn\u2019t have anything to care about anymore, so I tried it, and when it alleviated the heaviness in my body and clouded the dark thoughts inside my head, I knew it was the only way I was going to survive. I\u2019ve been doing it pretty much every day for nine months now, and it\u2019s part of life for me. Without it, acceptance of what my life really is\u2014what I\u2019ve become\u2014would be unbearable.</p><p>Nova stands back up, smoothing the wrinkles out of her dress. When she looks at me, her eyes are enormous and crammed with worry. The abruptness of her shift in demeanor throws me off balance.</p><p>\u201cSo everyone is pretty determined to go to that concert in Fairfield,\u201d she says, slipping her fingers below the bands on her wrist. She scratches at the skin, seeming anxious and out of her element. \u201cAnd it\u2019s like a weeklong event or something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt could be fun.\u201d I stuff my wallet into the back pocket of my jeans. \u201cYou should go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah... Delilah keeps pushing, but like I said, I\u2019m not really a fan of concerts anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause they\u2019re too noisy?\u201d</p><p>She nods as she coils a strand of her hair around her finger. \u201cPlus, I\u2019d be there with Dylan and Delilah and sharing a tent with them and they\u2019d probably want to do stuff... They wouldn\u2019t even care that I could hear them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t Tristan going?\u201d I ask, grabbing my watch off the bed. \u201cYou could share a tent with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but... I don\u2019t know. It\u2019d be weird with just the two of us.\u201d By the way she says it, I suspect she knows Tristan has a thing for her and that she doesn\u2019t like it. She unravels her hair from her finger and then stands up straight. \u201cYou could go, too, and then I wouldn\u2019t have to share a tent alone with Tristan.\u201d</p><p>I fasten the buckle on my leather band watch. \u201cBut why would you want to share a tent with me, too? You barely know me.\u201d</p><p>She skims my body and then steadily maintains my gaze, even though her hands are trembling at her side. I feel very vulnerable, as if she\u2019s reading me like an open book. It\u2019s like she\u2019s been hiding this fiery personality from me, and it\u2019s starting to show. I\u2019m not sure if I like it or hate it or if I should even be analyzing it. \u201cThat\u2019s okay. Then I can get to know you,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to do that,\u201d I assure her, doing her a huge favor. I start to step around her, but she matches my movement, cutting me off.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d Her tone carries a silent plea. I have no idea where it stems from, but I get the feeling it has nothing to do with me. But I know I should say no, because I promised Lexi that no matter what, I would never forget her, and Nova seems like the kind of girl a lot of guys could get caught up in: sad, vulnerable, determined. And those goddamn big blue eyes of hers... they\u2019re seriously getting to me. I rub my hand across my face, preparing to turn her down, but when I open my mouth my answer completely contradicts my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I tell her and my hand falls to my side. I\u2019m stunned and thoroughly pissed off at myself. I\u2019m about to tell her I didn\u2019t mean it, but her eyes light up.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she says and then she takes a step forward, lifting her hands up. I have no idea what the hell she\u2019s doing and she looks as baffled as I feel. And terrified. Then all of a sudden she\u2019s wrapping her arms around me and giving me a hug. Her heart is knocking in her chest, going about as fast as mine.</p><p>I tense, unsure what to do. Then I start to pull back, but like a moron, gravity pulls me forward and I fold my arms around her waist, giving her a hug back, feeling guilty from the gratifying contact, but completely consumed by it at the same time. I blame it on the weed still lingering in my system, because I\u2019m normally more careful than this. I\u2019ve become a pro at pushing people away, and now suddenly I\u2019m fucking careless\u2014it has to be the weed.</p><p>\u201cLook... Nova...\u201d My eyes shut as I inhale in the sweet scent of her. \u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>She rapidly pulls away. \u201cSo I think Dylan or Delilah will drive. Or maybe Tristan. I think everyone\u2019s still deciding who\u2019s driving.\u201d</p><p>Does she know what she\u2019s doing? Does she know that I don\u2019t want to go, so she keeps talking so I can\u2019t get out of it? \u201cI\u2019m not a fan of road trips,\u201d I lie in a lame attempt to get out of it without making a big deal.</p><p>A smile accentuates her lips, and it enhances the green specks in her eyes. \u201cNeither am I, but it\u2019s only like a four-hour drive.\u201d She playfully pinches my arm, stunning me, and I flinch. \u201cAnd you can sit by me.\u201d Before I can even begin to respond to her extreme flip of attitude, she turns toward the door and opens it. \u201cEveryone\u2019s hanging out in the living room. You should come out there.\u201d Then she walks out and closes the door.</p><p>I stand in the middle of my small, shitty-ass room, stunned and speechless. This isn\u2019t how I work. I don\u2019t just go on road trips and go to concerts with a girl who obviously wants to hang out and get to know me. I get high, I draw meaningless shit, and I fuck. That\u2019s it. Because if I do anything else, my life will have purpose, and I deserve to be miserable until my life comes to an end, which is hopefully soon.</p><p>Nova</p><p>I run straight to the bathroom to throw up, moving so swiftly I don\u2019t have time to count my steps. I\u2019m not even sure why I get nauseous; whether it\u2019s due to the fact that I pretty much made a commitment to go to the concert or because I\u2019m nervous to be flirting with someone or that I feel guilty over flirting. I was never good at flirting, and it always made me come off as an awkward weirdo. That\u2019s why I lucked out with Landon. He did all the pursuing, otherwise we\u2019d never have gotten anywhere past just being friends.</p><p>I burst into the bathroom and I barely make it to the toilet as vomit burns at the back of my throat. After I barf up the chicken sandwich I had for lunch, I spread a towel down on the grimy linoleum floor and sit down on it. There\u2019s very little space between the toilet and the bathtub, and I have to keep my elbows tucked in from touching either one, because they both look equally disgusting. I tap my finger on the video icon on the screen of my phone and then hit record. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I look pallid on the screen and my eyes are red and watery. \u201cIt\u2019s been a few weeks since I saw Quinton at the ice cream parlor and I\u2019ve been spending a lot of time feeling adrift. A couple of nights ago, I woke up from this dream, where Landon was still alive and we were married and happy. In the grogginess of exhaustion, I ended up getting out of bed and wandering across the street in the middle of the night to the hill where I last saw Landon alive. For a moment, I swear I could envision us both lying there in the grass together, but then Landon slowly faded and eventually so did I.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not even sure what compelled me to go there, but I couldn\u2019t seem to find a reason to leave until morning when the new owners of the house came out and yelled at me for trespassing. I think they thought I was high or drunk or something, and that\u2019s kind of how I felt\u2014so detached. I\u2019ve been overanalyzing why I did it... why I just walked over there in the middle of the night, like I was sleepwalking or something, and honestly I have no idea...\u201d</p><p>I fight to keep my voice even as I tuck my hair behind my ears. \u201cAnyway, I woke up this morning and forced myself to feel different\u2014less weighted. I randomly decided I needed a change from the lack of purpose and that I needed to do something magical.\u201d I pull a disgusted face at my cheerful choice of word. \u201cWell, maybe magical isn\u2019t the right word\u2014more like out of the ordinary, at least for me, which is a really big deal because I don\u2019t do out-of-the-ordinary very well.\u201d I tip the camera to the side as I pull my knees up and wrap one arm around them. \u201cSo I did something completely and utterly difficult for me\u2014I did the first thing that popped into my head and came over here to ask Quinton to go to the concert with us, even though the idea of going to one makes me want to vomit. I think it might be my inner conscience telling me that I need to get to know him. Delilah says he\u2019s been through a lot, but Dylan and Tristan wouldn\u2019t give her the details. They\u2019ll only say that he\u2019s had a lot of death in his life lately and that he\u2019s messed up in the head.\u201d</p><p>I pause, picturing the heavy sorrow in his honey-brown eyes, and then I picture Landon\u2019s. They match, at least in my head they do. \u201cI want to help him, though.\u201d I bite at my lip. \u201cI blame it on the dream I had about Quinton last night, which is a complete change from the ones I\u2019ve been having about Landon. Quinton was drowning in the ocean, which is weird because I\u2019ve never been to the ocean, but anyway, he was drowning and I was watching him drown and he was begging me to help him, but all I would do is was stand on the shore and watch him drown.\u201d Guilt clouds my eyes and they look strange on the dim, low-resolution screen. \u201cGod, that makes me seem really twisted, doesn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p> <p>I hear knocking on the door. \u201cNova, are you in there?\u201d I flinch as Delilah\u2019s voice carries through from the other side.</p><p>\u201cAnd are you talking to yourself?\u201d she asks. \u201cOr are you making a movie in the bathroom, because that would be weird.\u201d</p><p>I quickly shut the camera off, stand up, and hang the towel back on the rack before opening the door. \u201cI was actually going to the bathroom.\u201d I point over my shoulder at the toilet. \u201cThat is what those things are known for.\u201d</p><p>She sticks out her tongue, then stands on her tiptoes to peek over my shoulder. \u201cAre you sure you weren\u2019t doing anything weird in here? I\u2019m picking up a vibe.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and gesture her out of the door as I shuffle forward. \u201cYou\u2019re crossing the lines of our friendship boundaries, Delilah. Seriously.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI guess so,\u201d she says, sounding suspicious, but she shrugs and ambles up the hall, tracking her finger along the wall. \u201cSo what\u2019d you say to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d I count the cracks in the paneling on the walls as I follow her.</p><p>She tips her head to the side and peers over her shoulder at me. \u201cQuinton. Dylan says he\u2019s been in his room for like three days and he just came out. Plus he suddenly decided he was going to go to the concert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just asked him,\u201d I say with a casual shrug, but my heart squeezes in my chest a little. He\u2019s been in his room for three days. \u201cAnd he said okay.\u201d</p><p>She eyes me skeptically as she stops at the end of the hall and bends her knee, bringing her foot up to refasten the strap on her sandal. \u201cJust be careful.\u201d She returns her foot to the floor, tugs down the bottom of her leather skirt, and then leans in toward me. \u201cGuys like Dylan and Quinton are not easy to date, if that\u2019s even what they\u2019ll call it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should take your own advice,\u201d I tell her in a low voice, flicking a piece of ash out of her hair and it lands on her arm.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a lot different than you, Nova,\u201d she says, dusting the ash off her skin. \u201cBesides, my mom raised me to be a skank, so that\u2019s what I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDelilah...,\u201d I start, but she scowls at me, so I wrap my arm around her shoulders and pull her in for a hug as we round the corner.</p><p>Quinton and Tristan aren\u2019t in the living room, but Dylan is sitting in the torn up recliner near the television. Music flows from the speakers\u2014\u201cBlue\u201d by A Perfect Circle\u2014and two lit joints are balanced on an ashtray on the coffee table. There are blankets hanging over the windows, blocking out the sunlight and reducing the circulation, and it makes the air misty and fortified with smoke.</p><p>\u201cShit, what\u2019d I miss?\u201d Dylan asks. He takes in the closeness of Delilah and me, and his eyes shadow over. He has his boots kicked up on the table and a newspaper piled with green flakes on his lap. \u201cAnd why was I not back there watching it?\u201d</p><p>Delilah picks up a cup on a nearby table and chucks it at Dylan\u2019s head. \u201cDon\u2019t be such a pervert. If you want a show, watch some porn.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t move quickly enough. The cup hits him in the forehead, and some of the liquid in it spills on the weed. \u201cFucking watch it, Delilah, or I\u2019ll kick your goddamn ass out.\u201d There\u2019s a sharpness in his voice; he\u2019s no longer playing around as he shifts his weight forward and carefully lifts the newspaper away from his lap.</p><p>Delilah narrows her eyes as she marches up to the coffee table in front of Dylan with her hands on her hips. \u201cDon\u2019t you talk to me like that. I\u2019m not one of your little sluts. You can\u2019t just do and say whatever you want to me.\u201d</p><p>His eyes darken as he sets the newspaper down on the table and rises to his feet. A bright red welt is forming on his forehead from where the cup hit him. \u201cThat\u2019s not what you said last night,\u201d he says darkly as he slowly stalks around the table toward her. A vein in his neck bulges. \u201cIn fact, if I\u2019m remembering right, you were pretty much begging me to do whatever I wanted with you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was...\u201d She peeks back at me and her expression tenses before she looks back at Dylan. \u201cI was high, okay? I would have said anything.\u201d</p><p>I press my back against the wall, fiddling with a strap on my dress. I wonder if she lied to me when she said she hadn\u2019t smoked weed since college\u2014and if she did, why? Why is everyone always trying to shelter me from it? I\u2019m not about to ask her in front of Dylan, though, who\u2019s pretty much scaring the hell out of me at the moment.</p><p>Dylan\u2019s eyes stay fastened on Delilah as he gets in her face with his hands balled at his sides. \u201cIs that the real reason you\u2019re with me? For my fucking pot?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head and lets out an uneasy breath as she cautiously places her hand on his chest. \u201cYou know that\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen prove it,\u201d he says and then his hands dart forward, fingers curled, mouth set in a line.</p><p>I think he\u2019s going to hit her, but instead he roughly snags her by the waist and picks her up from the ground. She goes a little rigid as he grabs her butt and forces her legs around him. Then he strides by, nearly running into me, and heads for the hallway, carrying her with him.</p><p>I give her a what-the-hell look as her eyes lock on me from over his shoulder. \u201cDelilah...\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head and mouths, I\u2019m fine. Just wait out here.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to wait out here. I want her to do what she wants to do, and from the look on her face, she doesn\u2019t want to go back with Dylan, but she leans away and kisses him deeply as they duck through the curtain and disappear down the hall.</p><p>She makes me so nervous sometimes. Dylan\u2019s always been a jerk, but that was a little intense even for him. I wonder if he was really contemplating hitting her and then backed out at the last second. If he\u2019d tried, would I have really tried to stop it? I\u2019m not sure, because from past experiences, I\u2019ve never been one to intervene in people\u2019s personal business. Maybe it\u2019s time, though. Time to start living life differently. But which direction is the right one to follow? And what are my choices even? Go to school, pick a major, and hope it\u2019ll make me happy?</p><p>I drop down on the couch and stare at the pile of weed and the joints burning in the ashtray, wondering if I should put them out because there\u2019s a lot of potent smoke flooding the room. But my hands remain on my lap as I ponder what the world looks like after someone smokes it. What did it make the world look like to Landon? Why does Delilah do it? Or Quinton? Or even Dylan and Tristan? What is so enticing about the stuff? Or is enticing the right word? Addictive?</p><p>My thoughts drift to the first time I ever found out Landon smoked weed. We were sixteen, and I was so na\u00efve, I thought his bong was some crazy art piece\u2014he was always creating weird sculptures all the time.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch that,\u201d he\u2019d warned when I\u2019d gone to pick it up off his dresser.</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry,\u201d I said, backing away, letting my hands fall to my sides. \u201cIs it breakable or something?\u201d</p><p>He let out this low laugh, the one he used on me whenever he was amused by my aloofness. \u201cYeah, but that\u2019s not why you can\u2019t touch it.\u201d</p><p>My gaze swept around his room and I noticed that there was smokiness to the air. \u201cWait a minute... is that...\u201d My eyes widened as my gaze landed back on the dresser. \u201cIs that a bong?\u201d</p><p>He used the laugh on me again and it made me flustered. He shook his head, and then wound around the foot of his unmade bed, coming to a stop in front of me. I tipped my chin up to meet his sad eyes, and he cupped my cheeks in his hands.</p><p>\u201cI love that you have no idea what it is, Nova,\u201d he said, grazing the pad of his thumb down my cheek, almost looking like he was going to cry. \u201cYou\u2019re too good to know what it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what it is,\u201d I protested. \u201cBut why are you doing that stuff and how did I not know about it? I thought we knew everything about each other.\u201d</p><p>He smiled sadly as he traced a path with his finger across my bottom lip. \u201cTrust me, Nova. You\u2019re better off not knowing half of the shit that goes on inside my head. You\u2019re too beautiful and good for that.\u201d He nodded his head at the bong on his dresser. \u201cFor any of this.\u201d</p><p>But I\u2019m not. Just talk to me was what I thought. But what I said was nothing. Nothing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I blink the thought from my head, rub my watery eyes, and pluck a flake of weed from the pile and hold it between my thumb and my finger. \u201cWho were you to decide what I wanted to know?\u201d I mutter, my chest aching, along with my heart. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you ever just tell me things, instead of deciding for me that I was too good to know? Why couldn\u2019t you just tell me and let me decide? Why wouldn\u2019t you just talk to me, instead of deciding to leave me? Here. Alone. With a head full of fucking numbers. I feel so lost all the time...\u201d</p><p>Suddenly the potential for a new, magical day is gone. The longer I sit there, the more pissed off I get, which only makes me feel guilty, but then the guilt makes me feel angry, and suddenly my head\u2019s spinning and I can\u2019t even remember sitting down.</p><p>Somewhere through the spinning and racing thoughts, I hear the door creak open, and Quinton comes walking inside. I quickly toss the flake down onto the pile, but it\u2019s too late; he\u2019s already seen me holding it. As he pushes the door open wider, he arches his eyebrow at me with curiosity written all over his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, sitting here by yourself?\u201d he asks as Tristan walks in carrying a large cardboard box, his face red and beads of sweat coating his skin.</p> <p>\u201cNothing.\u201d I slump back in the chair, trying to ignore the stinging in my eyes. \u201cI\u2019m just sitting here.\u201d</p><p>He looks at me suspiciously as he closes the door, then he saunters to the back of the couch and launches himself over it, landing on the cushion with a hard bounce. \u201cWhere did you run off to when you left my room?\u201d he asks, kicking up his unlaced boots onto the table. He has three holes in the hem of his shirt and one in the collar, along with a few smudges and spots of ink and charcoal.</p><p>I shrug, fold my arms around myself, and grip my phone tightly in my hand. \u201cI\u2019ve been here the whole time. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly shit.\u201d Tristan\u2019s arm muscles are flexed as he drops the box down on the countertop. He wipes the sweat from his forehead with the back of his hand. \u201cThis thing is fucking heavy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell you didn\u2019t have to take all the pipes,\u201d Quinton calls out. His glazed eyes are still fixed on me. \u201cYou could have just taken one or two.\u201d</p> <p>Tristan starts searching around in the box, taking out pipe after pipe and lining them up on the countertop. \u201cAnd what? Turn down free pipes? That\u2019d be fucking stupid of me.\u201d</p><p>Quinton seems like he wants to argue with him, but he clenches his jaw shut and directs his attention to me. \u201cBut you disappeared for a while, right? Because when I walked through here just a bit ago, you weren\u2019t here.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s because I was in the bathroom, barfing my guts out because I think you\u2019re hot, but I feel guilty about it. And then I decided to make a video about my twisted thoughts about you. I\u2019m starting to grow flustered, so I try for a subject change. \u201cDo you guys have anything to drink?\u201d I blink my eyes against the smoke and then press my fingertips against my eyeballs. My head\u2019s feeling a little heavy and lopsided.</p><p>Tristan peeks up from the box, and strands of his blond hair fall into his eyes as the corners of his lips tug upward. \u201cLike a Corona or two or three?\u201d</p><p>Staring blankly at him, I hold up my finger\u2014not the middle one, even though I want to, which is a little blunt for me, but at the moment being blunt seems awesome. \u201cOne time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne freakin\u2019 memorable time.\u201d Tristan teases, clutching a pipe in his hand. When I narrow my eyes at him, he starts laughing, and accidentally drops the pipe onto the ground. He bends to pick it up, stumbles a little, and bumps his head on the side of the counter. \u201cShit.\u201d He stands up, rubbing his head.</p> <p>I stare at the joints in the ashtray, a thin stream of grayish smoke slithering from them, and blurred, disjointed thoughts run in an uneven flow inside my head. \u201cWhy do you guys do it?\u201d I ask, because I really want to know\u2014understand\u2014what Landon\u2019s fascination was with it all the time. Why did he smoke it? How did it make him feel inside? Why was he so dead set on thinking that I was too good to smoke it and feel what it\u2019s like to be high, yet he didn\u2019t think he was good enough? Why? God damn it. There are always so many questions about him, about how he saw me, and I\u2019ll never get an answer, because he\u2019s not here anymore. The only way I\u2019ll ever even possibly begin to know is to try and find out for myself.</p><p>Quinton tracks my gaze and then his face drops, like he just realized the joints were there. \u201cFuck, who left these burning out here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were like that when I came out,\u201d I say, picking at my fingernails.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you put them out?\u201d Quinton asks me, allowing his feet to fall to the floor.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I rack my brain for my real answer and the one that comes to me is kind of frightening. Because I was thinking about smoking it. Because I wanted to see what it was like\u2014what it was like for Landon. Why he thought I was too good to see what it was like.</p><p>He leans forward, picks them up, and scrapes the tips gently along the edge of the table, putting them out. \u201cYou don\u2019t want this shit, Nova. Trust me. You\u2019re too good for it.\u201d</p><p>His words tear at my heart, because they\u2019re so similar to what Landon used to say to me all the time. But they also annoy me. I want people to stop telling me I\u2019m good when I don\u2019t even know if I am. I\u2019m not sure if my irritation is directed at him, though, or if I\u2019m just lashing out on him because I\u2019m frustrated with Landon for leaving me. Or maybe all the secondhand smoke in the room is bringing out an ugly side of me. \u201cHow do you know what I want? You don\u2019t even know me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t even know me,\u201d he says calmly as he places the unlit joints on the table. He glances over his shoulder at Tristan, who\u2019s distracted by the pipes in the kitchen, and then he leans in toward me and lowers his voice. \u201cSo let me give you a little insight. You don\u2019t want to be here, sitting with me, talking to me, or asking me to go to concerts. You don\u2019t want to know me, or this fucking fucked-up world I live in, Nova. Trust me.\u201d</p> <p>With a neutral expression, I slant forward and snatch a lighter and one of the unlit joints from off the table. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me, either, and you don\u2019t know what I want, so don\u2019t try and tell me you do.\u201d I know that what I\u2019m doing is probably wrong, or at least that\u2019s what I used to believe. Right now, I feel different. I don\u2019t care about right or wrong. I don\u2019t care about anything.</p><p>With an unsteady hand, I place the joint in my mouth, and ignoring both their protesting looks, I cup my hand around the end, and flick the lighter, figuring I can handle it. Nothing can prepare me for the fiery burn, though. As soon as the smoke hits the back of my throat, I cough and gasp for air. I lean forward, sticking my hand out, with the joint pinched between my fingers, wanting to get the joint as far away from my face as possible.</p><p>\u201cShit, Nova, are you okay?\u201d Tristan hurries around the couch, removes the joint from my hand, and extends his hand out to the side of him, with the joint between his fingers, to get the smoke as far away from my face as possible. \u201cWhat are you doing? You don\u2019t do this shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know me either.\u201d I sit up straight, still coughing while my eyes water.</p><p>Quinton frowns as he retrieves the joint from Tristan\u2019s hand, and Tristan gives me a pat on the back, although I can tell he\u2019s trying hard not to laugh at me.</p><p>Quinton positions the joint between his fingers, then he places the end between his lips, and his chest rises as he takes a deep inhale and holds it in. He balances the joint in the ashtray and relaxes back in the chair, letting his head fall back as he breathes out the cloud of smoke toward the ceiling. \u201cNova, you should go home,\u201d he says in a sluggish voice, rubbing his hand over his face, as Tristan drops down in the sofa beside him, his eyelids growing heavy.</p><p>It feels like I should still be irritated at him, but I can\u2019t really feel anything. My mind and body are numb and the counting and need for control are silent. Silence. Without even knowing what I\u2019m doing, or whether I\u2019m doing it because I want to understand, because the secondhand smoke has clouded my judgment, or because I actually want to do it, I slide my arm across the coffee table and grab the joint. Quinton turns his head and watches me as I place it into my mouth. Copying his exact movements, I let my chest expand as I suck in a breath, then I trap the smoke in my lungs, standing on the edge of the unknown, waiting and waiting, then finally I let it out, falling off the edge completely, wondering how hard it\u2019s going to be to climb back up. Or if I\u2019ll even want to.</p><p>Maybe this is what I\u2019ve been searching for during the last year. Maybe I\u2019ve been waiting around to fall. Maybe I don\u2019t know what I want or who I am without Landon, and maybe this is all in desperation to figure stuff out.</p><p>Or maybe I\u2019m just lost and I have no idea what the hell I\u2019m doing.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>Quinton</p><p>This is an honest-to-God first for me. I\u2019m ripped out of my mind, nearly floating to the ceiling\u2014or falling to the floor, depending on how you look at it\u2014and I can\u2019t bask in the detached feeling. Nova\u2019s got me preoccupied. Her blue eyes are red as hell, her pupils glossy, and I can tell she\u2019s struggling to keep her eyelids open. I don\u2019t like how caught up I am\u2014how worried I am about her. I get high so I don\u2019t have to worry or think, but somehow she\u2019s more powerful than the drugs, but what I\u2019d like to figure out is why. What makes her so different? What makes her so consuming?</p><p>I tried to talk her out of smoking the joint. The old Quinton\u2014the good, sober one\u2014would have snatched it right out of her hand, because it\u2019s obvious she\u2019s never smoked weed before and she\u2019s doing it to cover up something. But I\u2019m too far gone, and before I know it Tristan, Nova, and I are squished on the couch, sharing a king-sized bag of Doritos, staring at the movements on the cracked computer screen as the screen saver dances to the beat of the music.</p><p>\u201cDo you think it\u2019s trying to tell us something?\u201d Nova asks with a dazed look on her face as she analyzes the pink-and-green streams on the screen.</p><p>Tristan snorts a laugh as he grabs a handful of Doritos and drops them into his mouth; half of them fall onto his lap. \u201cYeah, that we should stop assessing lights on the screen.\u201d</p><p>I have my arm draped on the back of the couch and Nova\u2019s hair is scattered on my skin. \u201cI think it\u2019s trying to coexist with the lyrics.\u201d</p><p>She brings her lip in between her teeth as she glances up at me. \u201cThat\u2019s insightful.\u201d</p><p>Normally, when a girl looks at me the way she\u2019s looking at me, I\u2019d take her back to my room and lose track of time for a little while. But the good inside me is conflicting with the bad, and I can\u2019t seem to bring myself to say anything to her.</p><p>\u201cNot insightful,\u201d I say. \u201cJust thoughts.\u201d</p><p>She nods, like she gets what I\u2019m saying, but how could she, because I\u2019m not even making sense to myself. \u201cDo your thoughts ever get jumbled in your head?\u201d she wonders, rubbing at her eyes with her fingertips. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I can tell we\u2019re about to head down that path, paved of weed, smoke, and senseless nonsense that can only be found when the mind hits an idyllic state of stupidity, and I don\u2019t want to do that. I don\u2019t want to get to know her, because it\u2019ll mean too much and I don\u2019t want meaning in anything in my life. It\u2019s the point of existing in the state I\u2019m in; the one where nothing matters except getting high and feeling numb, because once things start to mean something, it becomes harder to follow the wrong path.</p><p>\u201cI think we should find a way to get you home,\u201d I say, lowering my feet to the floor. I mean it. I really want her to leave, not just so she\u2019ll quit messing with my emotions, but because she doesn\u2019t belong here in this house\u2014in this lifestyle.</p><p>She frowns, seeming hurt. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>I glance at Tristan, hoping he\u2019ll chime in and help, but he has his head tipped back against the sofa and his eyes locked on the ceiling. \u201cBecause... I don\u2019t think you should be in a place like this.\u201d</p> <p>She looks as if she\u2019s struggling to get mad, her cheeks tinting pink, like she wants to be angry with me. \u201cDelilah\u2019s still back there with Dylan, and I can\u2019t leave her here. Plus, she\u2019s my ride home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can find you another ride,\u201d I say. Tristan lifts his head up and looks at me inquisitively. \u201cMaybe we can ask Frankie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Frankie?\u201d she asks, her head falling back as she tries to look me in the eyes. My arm is still on the back of the couch, and her head is resting in the crook of it. Her neck is curved back and her chest is sticking out a little from her top, giving me the slightest view of the curves of her breasts. Under normal circumstances, with a different girl, I\u2019d just take her back to my room and fuck her, then tell her to leave. But she keeps blinking up at me, looking helpless, and all it does is make me want to hold her. It\u2019s driving my goddamn body and mind crazy. It\u2019s definitely time for her to go.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the neighbor.\u201d Tristan stands up, collecting the bag of chips off the table. \u201cAnd Nova can stay here if she wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to,\u201d Nova says, slowly picking her head back up. She blinks and gathers fallen strands of her hair behind her ears.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea,\u201d I object, despite my body\u2019s opposing reaction. I\u2019m about to add a list of reasons why someone like her should not be sitting here with us, when the front door opens and two guys come strolling in like they own the place. One of them has a backpack on and the other has what looks like a closed pocket knife in his hand. He\u2019s probably carrying in case Dylan or Tristan tries to screw them over with whatever they\u2019re dealing. It\u2019s only a threat, warning everyone not to mess with them, but when you\u2019ve got a room full of illegal substances and a bunch of paranoid people high out of their minds, things can get ugly fast.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Tristan says to the shorter of the two as he winds around the sofa, yawning. They slap hands and bump fists, and then the taller one\u2019s eyes land on Nova as she sits up in the sofa. He\u2019s got sores all over his face, his teeth are yellow, and his gaze drinks Nova in like she\u2019s a dose of heroin as one of her straps fall off her shoulder. She shifts uncomfortably, leaning into me as her shoulders slump in.</p><p>I position the strap back up over her shoulder, then slip her fingers through mine as I stand up, pulling her with me, despite my initial reaction to go over there and see what they\u2019re dealing\u2014see if I want it. \u201cHave fun, man,\u201d I say to Tristan, leading Nova toward the curtain.</p><p>Tristan waves at me, totally distracted by the idea of getting drugs, and I\u2019m not surprised. Yeah, he may have a little bit of a thing for Nova, but when you\u2019ve tasted the addiction of drugs, it\u2019s pretty much all that matters when it\u2019s in front of you.</p><p>Nova more than willingly follows me toward the hall, grasping my hand, and one of the drug-dealing crackheads says something about having a ride with her when I\u2019m finished. He thinks I\u2019m going to screw her, but there\u2019s no way I\u2019d try to, especially when she\u2019s this far out of her mind. She\u2019s too sad and lost, and the last thing I want to do is ruin her more. But the good-guy thought process is the old Quinton seeping through, and by the time we reach my room, I\u2019m panicking, trying to decide whether to run out of the room and leave her here alone, or scoop her up, lay her down on the bed, and rip her clothes off.</p><p>Nova instantly makes herself at home, strolling up to the iPod dock and picking up my iPod. She bites on her bottom lip as she scrolls through the songs, her head swaying from side to side as she contemplates the song list.</p> <p>\u201cYou have good taste in music,\u201d she observes, peeking up at me through her eyelashes.</p><p>I run my fingers through my hair as I linger near the doorway, with my hand on the doorknob, ready to bolt. \u201cYeah, I guess.\u201d</p><p>She taps the screen, puts the iPod in the dock, and seconds later lyrics fill up the room. She sinks down on the edge of my bed, tucking one of her feet underneath her ass, and then her eyes lock on me. \u201cQuinton, why did you move here?\u201d</p><p>Every single one of my muscles wind into overly tight knots. \u201cI really don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she says simply, and then looks around at the drawings that are tacked on the wall. When she spots the one of Lexi, she stares it for a very long time, and her eyes start to fill with water. \u201cI used to have a boyfriend that sketched like you.\u201d She angles her head to the side and a tear slips out and falls down her cheek. \u201cBut he\u2019s dead, so he doesn\u2019t anymore.\u201d Blinking franticly, she forces her eyes from the drawing, and looks desperately at me, like she wants me to say something to make her stop talking.</p><p>Tristan told me her boyfriend died, although he never explained how. Death is a sensitive subject for the both of us and we always try to dodge around it, even though it\u2019s always there, existing, an invisible wall between us.</p><p>\u201cNova, we don\u2019t have to talk,\u201d I say, finally daring a step away from the door. \u201cWe can just go to bed or something.\u201d</p><p>She glances at the bed behind her and then her cheeks turn a little red. \u201cLike have sex?\u201d</p> <p>The depressing atmosphere lightens a little, and I rub my hand across my face, trying not to laugh at her. \u201cNo, like lie down, shut our eyes, and go to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, really.\u201d Contradicting herself, she yawns and stretches her arms above her head. \u201cWell, maybe we could lie down for a bit, I guess.\u201d</p><p>I nod and she instantly collapses onto the bed. Her brown hair is sprawled across the pillow and her eyes look lost, like she\u2019s floating away from reality. My fingers long to grab a pencil and paper from the dresser and capture the perfection in her face, her eyes, and her body, but I promised never again and I need to stick with it. Drawing someone, in these circumstances, is way too personal.</p><p>Breaking the moment, she turns onto her side and faces the wall with her back to me. He dress barely covers her ass, and one of the shoulder straps is falling down again. Some guys would have completely and utterly taken advantage of her at this point, but as much as I\u2019ve slept around, taking advantage is something I can\u2019t do. Even with as far as I am in the fucking dark, the good Quinton still has a vague amount of control over certain things.</p><p>I lay down on the bed beside her, careful not to touch her, keeping one arm under my head and one on my side, as I scoot back so I\u2019m barely on the bed.</p><p>She rolls over, facing me, and then stares at me for so long, it almost drives me crazy. \u201cDid you love her?\u201d she finally asks.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe girl on the wall.\u201d</p><p>My heart pounds inside my chest, nearly cracking my lungs. \u201cYeah... but I don\u2019t want to talk about her.\u201d</p><p>She looks perplexed, drifting off into her thoughts. \u201cOkay... I understand.\u201d She releases an uneven breath before shaking her head. \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite color?\u201d</p><p>I arch my eyebrows, wondering where the abrupt subject change came from. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite color?\u201d she repeats without an explanation.</p><p>I search her eyes for a reason why she\u2019s asking, but I don\u2019t know her at all, so I can\u2019t figure her out. \u201cI don\u2019t know... black onyx.\u201d</p><p>Her lips curve upward. \u201cThat\u2019s such an artist answer. Most people would say like purple or blue, but you... black onyx.\u201d She laughs under her breath, and it seems a little more natural than the other couple of times I\u2019ve heard her laugh. But she\u2019s high, which means it\u2019s not real. None of this is, which makes it easier.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d I ask. \u201cWhat\u2019s yours?\u201d</p><p>She mulls it over, pressing a smile back. \u201cIndigo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that really your favorite color?\u201d I inch forward slightly on the bed to keep from falling off the edge. \u201cOr are you just trying to impress me?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs, rolling her tongue in her mouth, amused. \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChicken teriyaki,\u201d I reply, wondering if we\u2019re entering a game of twenty questions or something. \u201cNova, where are you going with this?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs again. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to get to know you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d I roll to my side and straighten my arm out so I can reach my cigarettes on the dresser. I pull one out, grab my lighter, and then turn back over. \u201cIn fact, I should have never brought you back here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did you?\u201d she asks, watching me intently, as I light up the cigarette and toss the lighter onto the foot of the bed.</p><p>I slant my head to the side to avoid blowing smoke in her face. \u201cTo get you away from those guys.\u201d</p><p>She assesses me closely, like she\u2019s trying to unravel what I\u2019m thinking. \u201cWhat\u2019s your\u2014\u201d</p><p>I cover her mouth with my hand and shake my head. \u201cNo way. I get to ask one now.\u201d</p><p>Her lips curve upward against my hand. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>I lower my hand to my side. \u201cFirst car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever had one,\u201d she answers, her voice shaking and off pitch. \u201cWell, besides the one my dad gave me.\u201d</p><p>I want to ask her how he died, but that\u2019d be bringing up the subject of death. \u201cFavorite band?\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes. \u201cYou can\u2019t have a favorite band. It\u2019s not possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d I argue, reaching behind me to ash the cigarette on the floor. \u201cThere\u2019s always one that outweighs the others just a little bit.\u201d</p><p>She points a finger at me. \u201cThen you are not a true music lover, my friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, too,\u201d I say, slightly offended but entertained at the same time. \u201cI promise. But I do have a favorite band.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPink Floyd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotal guy copout answer.\u201d She smiles and I love the sight of it. It makes me want to continue on in this little flirty state we\u2019ve arrived at and keep going, move forward, at least until I sober up and life and reality return to me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can prove it,\u201d I insist and take a drag from the cigarette.</p><p>She looks me over with inquisitiveness. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cName a random band\u2014one you think I\u2019ll never know\u2014and see if I do.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes briefly wander to the ceiling as she considers my challenge. \u201cOkay, but if you lose then you owe me something.\u201d</p> <p>I smile amusedly. \u201cOwe you what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething,\u201d she says, and her blue eyes sparkle.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I sit up and put the cigarette out in an old soda can up on the dresser. \u201cBut if I win, then you owe me something.\u201d</p><p>She sticks out her hand. \u201cYou have a deal, Quinton...\u201d She trails off. \u201cWhat is your last name anyway?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve never been a fan of telling my people my last name. That way if I decide to bail out of their lives, it makes things easier because it makes it harder for them to track me down. I\u2019ve been going through the last year introducing myself to people as Quinton, giving them as little detail about me as I can. And no one ever asked me to offer more. \u201cCarter,\u201d I say. \u201cMy name is Quinton Carter.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right, Quinton Carter.\u201d She pushes her hand at me. \u201cYou have a deal.\u201d</p><p>I place my hand in hers, noting how warm her skin is, and how long and thin her fingers are. \u201cOkay, you have a deal, Nova Reed. Now give me a band.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re still holding hands, but I don\u2019t try to let go. I\u2019ll give us this little moment until it\u2019s over and then I\u2019ll walk away from it forever, because that\u2019s what I need to do, at least that\u2019s what the good side of me\u2014the old side of me\u2014is telling me to do. Or maybe it\u2019s the new side... I\u2019m having a hard time distinguishing between the two at the moment. Good. Bad. Right. Wrong.</p><p>\u201cBrand New,\u201d she finally says.</p><p>I stare at her stoically, so she can\u2019t read my expression. I know the band, but I want to make her think I don\u2019t. \u201cBrand who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew,\u201d she enunciates, and I can tell by the pleased look on her face that she thinks she\u2019s won.</p> <p>I fake uncertainty for a few moments longer, and then let a grin spread at my lips. \u201cOh, Brand New.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t know them.\u201d She props up on her elbow and rests her head against her hand. \u201cI checked your iPod and they weren\u2019t on there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you didn\u2019t check the playlists.\u201d I slip my fingers out of her hand, and her lips part as I climb off the bed and walk over to the dresser. I pick up the iPod, scroll to the Hidden playlist, compiled of songs I used to listen to when I was with Lexi. I hesitate, knowing that there\u2019s a good chance that turning it on is going to fling me down memory lane. But I want to win, to prove that I know music, to prove to her that I listen to the same music as her, and honestly because I love the idea that she\u2019ll owe me something, even if I probably won\u2019t ever act on it. With an unsteady finger, I tap my finger on the Brand New section and hit Play on \u201cMe vs. Maradona vs. Elvis.\u201d The song clicks on, and I shut my eyes with my back to Nova as the soft lyrics and nearly soundless tune takes me to the last time I listened to it: a year and a half ago, when my life had direction and purpose.</p><p>\u201cWhat would happen if I ran away?\u201d Lexi had asked as we sat in my car, staring out at the town below the cliffs. We\u2019d driven up to the turnout, a place where teenagers went to make out, which we had done plenty of, but then Lexi went into thinking mode, and suddenly we were talking about life.</p><p>\u201cWell, I hope you won\u2019t run away from me.\u201d I laced my fingers through hers as I pulled the visor down to block out the piercing pink glow from the setting sun. The song was playing in the background, turned down quiet enough that we could talk without yelling, but loud enough that it was known it would be forever linked to that moment.</p><p>She\u2019d stared at me for a moment, and then glanced down at our hands entwined together. \u201cBut what if I wanted to run away from my life? You\u2019re a huge part of that, Quinton, so if you came, I really wouldn\u2019t be running away.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019d been something about her, maybe the look in her eyes or the tone of her voice, but it seemed like she\u2019d actually thought about this before.</p><p>I brought her hand up to my lips and grazed them across her knuckles. \u201cLexi Davis, if you run away, then I\u2019d run away, because even though you don\u2019t want to admit it, you and I belong together.\u201d</p> <p>Most girls would have melted, but Lexi had always been tough to win over and to read. It\u2019d taken forever to get her to go on a date with me and even longer to make the commitment of being my girlfriend.</p><p>After a minute or two of pretending to be unaffected, she\u2019d finally given in and leaned over the console to kiss me. That night we\u2019d had sex for the first time. It was one of our greatest moments, full of meaning and connection, something I know I\u2019ll never have again.</p><p>Forcing myself away from the realness of the memory, I return to the fakeness of my room. I turn back to Nova, surprised to find that she looks like she\u2019s been crying. \u201cI told you I knew them,\u201d I say, kicking a shirt out of the way as I make my way back over to the bed.</p><p>She smiles, but it looks forced. \u201cYeah, you win.\u201d</p><p>Instead of getting on the bed, I squat down beside it, so I\u2019m at eye level with her. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d I ask, searching her eyes, which are still red, but a little more alert.</p><p>She nods slowly. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m feeling a little less foggy headed... but I\u2019m getting tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to go find Delilah?\u201d I ask, but she instantly shakes her head, and then straightens her arm above her so her head falls to the pillow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just going to shut my eyes for a few seconds.\u201d Her eyes start to pool with tears and I have no fucking clue what to do or say to calm her down. She smashes her quivering lips together, sucking back the tears. \u201cCan you stick the song on Repeat and then just lie down with me?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s something in her expression that makes it impossible to say no, like she\u2019ll crack if I do. So even though I don\u2019t really want to, I backtrack to the dresser, hit the Repeat button, and then situate on the bed beside her, making sure to leave some space between our bodies.</p><p>She straightens her arms above her head, still staring at me like I\u2019m a ghost, like I\u2019m not real. She starts scratching below the bands on her wrist, and I notice a thin white scar that runs horizontally along her skin. It could be just a coincidence, a crazy accident that left her with it, but it also could be something else. It\u2019s in the right area, just above the vein below the bottom of her hand. I could ask her about it, but then she might ask me stuff, like where the scar on my chest came from or what my tattoos mean. And I can\u2019t give her those answers. So I keep my lips fastened, letting things remain uncomplicated between us, simple, like my favorite color, food, and band. That way when it\u2019s all gone, it won\u2019t hurt as bad.</p><p>But she continues to keep her eyes on me, with her hands under her head, and the longer it goes on, the harder it becomes to keep my hands and thoughts to myself. She looks like she\u2019s going to start crying again, and I feel like I\u2019m on the verge of joining her.</p><p>\u201cQuinton,\u201d she whispers as a few stray tears escape her eyes. \u201cCan you do something for me?\u201d</p><p>The heart-wrenching sadness in her voice makes me want to do anything for her at the moment, if it\u2019ll get her to smile again. \u201cSure. What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you...\u201d She sucks her lip up into her teeth as more tears stream down her cheeks. \u201cWill you kiss me?\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t what I was expecting her to say at all. My mind starts racing, flooded with disturbing thoughts. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea... not like this.\u201d Not ever.</p><p>Tears cascade out of her eyes as she nods and release her lip from her teeth. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>My heart is thumping and each of her sobs triggers it to thud faster. I bring my hand forward and wipe some of her tears off her cheek with my thumb. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to.\u201d It\u2019s a partial lie because I do and I don\u2019t at the same time. \u201cI just don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea, considering we\u2019re both a little out of it.\u201d</p><p>She nods again and doesn\u2019t say a word, her eyelashes fluttering against the tears as she struggles to get them to stop. The look on her face is rupturing my heart, and as she rolls over to turn away from me, my willpower fractures. I grab her arm, and without saying a word, I draw her back to me. I can feel my own tears forcing their way up into my eyes as I realize that I\u2019m going to kiss her and it\u2019s going to actually mean something, not just to Nova but to me.</p><p>Grappling to breathe, I secure a finger underneath her chin, tip her face up, and press my lips to hers. She sucks in a sharp, stammering breath, then kisses me back like she\u2019s been trapping her breath for ages and suddenly I\u2019m supplying her with oxygen. I know I should pull back, but it\u2019s been a long time since the emptiness inside me hasn\u2019t been so hollow, and I find myself slipping my tongue into her mouth and kissing her back with way too much passion behind the kiss.</p><p>Things only get more intense when she traces her hand up the nape of my neck, then runs her fingers through my hair, drawing me closer, and the voice that\u2019s haunted my head\u2014the one telling me to stop\u2014abruptly shuts up. I roll to my side, positioning my body over hers, lining us together, as I explore her mouth with my tongue. A few tears drip from my eyes and fall onto her cheeks, which are soaked with her own tears. She keeps gasping, pulling me closer, pressing her body against mine, like she needs me near her or she\u2019ll die. Her legs circle my waist, and the dress she\u2019s wearing slips up and her bare legs graze the outside of my jeans. My hands start to wander downward toward the bottom of her dress, wanting to feel the softness of her skin. But when I reach the bottom of the fabric, I can\u2019t seem to go through with it, and at the same time her hands leave my hair. Just as quickly as it started, we stop it. Together. Both of us pulling away, panting, our eyes glossy with tears and regret as we roll onto our backs.</p><p>She cries soundlessly, with her arm draped over her head, and her chest wrenching as she cries. But I stop crying, staring at the cracks in the ceiling, letting myself die all over again.</p><p>Letting the hollowness take back over.</p><p>Nova</p><p>I\u2019m bawling my eyes out and I can\u2019t seem to stop. I kissed Quinton and touched him while he touched me. He\u2019s so much like Landon, and kissing and being with Quinton momentarily gave me a twisted sense of peace. It almost felt like I was with Landon again, and for a moment I think about just letting myself go, allowing things to heat up as much as they want to without holding back. I\u2019d never done that with Landon. Every time we\u2019d reach the point of having sex, I\u2019d always backed out. I let my fear own me and take away my chance of ever being with Landon completely. I\u2019ll never get that chance again. And I don\u2019t want to feel that kind of regret again. Ever.</p><p>But eventually I had to accept the excruciatingly painful reality that Quinton isn\u2019t Landon. They smell and taste so much different because they are different. I kissed Quinton. I kissed someone else besides Landon. Oh my God... And for a moment I actually liked it. I actually wanted to be on the bed with him, letting his tongue slide into my mouth while I ran my fingers through his hair. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Guilt and confusion take me over. I feel sick to my stomach, like I\u2019m going to throw up, and tears continue to pour out of my eyes. I cry for what seems like an eternity while Quinton stares silently at the ceiling beside me. Somehow I fall asleep and then next thing I know I\u2019m being shaken awake. Moving past the grogginess, the headache, and the hunger rumbling in my stomach, I open my eyes to Delilah kneeling on the bed beside me. Quinton is gone and his bedroom door is agape.</p><p>I sit up and she scoots back to give me room. I rub my eyes and yawn. The music is still playing and I\u2019m very unsettled on the inside, like each of my nerves is supersensitive. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d My voice is hoarse and my throat feels dry, like I just drank sand.</p><p>She inspects me closely, leaning in to examine my eyes, her hair falling into her face, and I notice the giant purplish hickey on her neck. \u201cYou tell me.\u201d There\u2019s speculation in her tone. \u201cNova, did you... did you smoke weed? Or have you been crying?\u201d</p><p>I tug the elastic out of my hair and secure it around my ponytail. \u201cBoth.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy were you crying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause.\u201d</p><p>She waits for more details that I\u2019ll never give to her. \u201cWhy did you smoke weed then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I answer truthfully. \u201cI\u2019m still trying to figure that out.\u201d</p><p>I wait for her to lecture me, chew me out for being so stupid, so I can call her a hypocrite, but she simply sighs and then backs off the bed.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d she says, motioning for me to get to my feet. \u201cDylan wants us out of here, for some reason, and honestly, I don\u2019t want to stick around and find out.\u201d</p><p>My knees wobble a little as I stand up and tug down the bottom of my dress. \u201cWhy do you sound mad at him? What did he do to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t do anything to me, so drop it.\u201d Her eyes turn to ice as she yanks open the bedroom door.</p><p>I raise my hands in front of me as I head for the door. \u201cSorry, it just seems like you\u2019re really upset about something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do you,\u201d she says, glancing over her shoulder at me, assessing my tear-stained eyes. \u201cWhat were you doing back here anyway?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI came back here with Quinton.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo do what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I say, but the lie sticks in my throat. \u201cWe just laid around and talked... listened to music.\u201d Kissed.</p><p>\u201cSlept together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but in the sense of actually sleeping,\u201d I reply in a snippy tone, bracing my hand against the wall as the room starts to spin. \u201cI didn\u2019t have sex with him.\u201d Just kissed. And it wasn\u2019t him with me. Not really. At least that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to tell myself.</p><p>She halts at the end of the hallway and I crash into the back of her. It only seems to aggravate me more, and I seriously consider pushing her to the floor because of it.</p><p>She turns around and sighs, placing a hand on each of my shoulders. \u201cI know you didn\u2019t have sex with him. And relax. You\u2019re coming down, and it\u2019s only going to get worse before it gets better.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m too tired to say anything else, so I nod, and we duck through the curtain and exit the hallway together. There\u2019s a bunch of guys in the living room and a few girls in skimpy dresses that barely cover their thighs and boobs. It\u2019s really loud and really bright and it\u2019s making me edgy.</p><p>Nikki is one of the girls there. She\u2019s sitting by Quinton on the larger sofa, laughing at something as he sips on a beer. He\u2019s smiling and it irritates me, but everything\u2019s irritating me at the moment, even the way my legs feel like two rubber bands weighted down my bricks.</p> <p>Delilah leans over Dylan\u2019s shoulder and whispers something in is ear. He shoots her a harsh look, then reaches up and cups the back of her neck, roughly yanks her in for a violent kiss. At first Delilah tries to pull back, but then she gives into him and kisses him back. I pretend to be engulfed in my thoughts, pressing my fingers to the brim of my nose, but my head is hollow, and I\u2019m very aware of all the sounds and noises going on around me. I want to count to regain some control over the situation, but it seems too much like a project, so I stand near the wall, while Dylan and Delilah make out, wanting to shout at everyone to shut the hell up.</p><p>While I\u2019m scratching at my wrist, trying to keep myself together, Quinton looks over at me. I can tell by the way his expression drops that he\u2019s not happy I\u2019m looking at him. I\u2019m not happy, either. I fight for my expression to remain neutral and tell my legs to move slowly as I head toward the front door. His eyes follow me, though, and it\u2019s hard not to run as the past nips at my heels and raw emotions fire up in my heart.</p><p>Once I\u2019m outside, in the summer air, I can breathe again, and my head starts to clear. As I lean over the railing, wanting to rest my head and go to sleep, I take in everything I\u2019ve done. I tell myself never again. Never. But deep down, I\u2019m already desperately longing for the brief silence the weed gave and the split second of comfort kissing Quinton brought me.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>July 12, Day 54 of Summer Break</p><p>Quinton</p><p>I\u2019ve felt like shit for the last couple weeks, even though I\u2019m smoking more weed than usual. Dylan bought a bunch of weed from various dealers and he\u2019s got the three of us testing them, to see which kind is the best. Why, I\u2019m not sure. Either he just really wants some good weed, or he\u2019s planning on selling some on his own and wants to check out the competition. I\u2019m guessing the latter, since Tristan\u2019s mentioned him dealing before.</p><p>After sampling the fifth bowl, I drag my ass to my room, grab my sketchbook, and flop down on the bed, planning on letting my hand go crazy and letting it draw some tripped out picture. But as I sit there, with my legs crossed and the blanket bunched up at my feet, all I can picture is the way Nova looked the last time I laid eyes on her and how soft her lips were, the way she felt underneath me, the scent of her hair, and the sound of regret as she sobbed.</p><p>I\u2019d woken up in the bed with her, feeling guilty, not just for kissing her, but because I\u2019d let her get high. I realized I should have ripped the joint out of her hand, but instead I\u2019d stood by and watched her basically jump off a fucking cliff. Some people can handle the fall pretty well, and they climb right back up, but there are others, like me, who don\u2019t care enough to figure out how, and I wonder which one Nova is.</p><p>Then I ended up fucking up even more by kissing her, because it wasn\u2019t the same as when I kiss someone like Nikki. With Nova we\u2019d talked before making out, she\u2019d made me smile, and I\u2019d made her smile. And for a second, even through the fog of drugs, the moment I spent searching her mouth with mine had altered into realness.</p><p>I\u2019d left her sleeping in my bed, hoping to run away from the feelings intensifying inside me; the one\u2019s telling me that I need to fix the mess. I ended up making it worse, though, when Nova saw me talking to Nikki. I could see the hatred in her eyes, and I knew she\u2019d stay away after that, and I haven\u2019t seen her since. It\u2019s a good thing, at least that\u2019s what I tell myself.</p><p>\u201cHey man,\u201d Dylan says, interrupting my thoughts. I blink at my drawing, realizing that through my daze, I\u2019ve managed to draw Nova\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou up for that concert in a few weeks, because we\u2019re trying to make plans and decide whose car to take?\u201d</p><p>I set the pencil and sketchbook down on the bed, shaking my head. \u201cNah, I think I\u2019m going to bail out... maybe...\u201d I trail off remembering how Nova begged me to go and how I told her I would, unintentionally. Part of me wants to do what I said I\u2019d do, while the other part is begging me to stay away from Nova, like I have been. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing yet, honestly. I\u2019m still deciding.\u201d</p><p>He backs out of the doorway with his hands in the pockets of his jeans. \u201cTristan will probably be fucking relieved if you decide not to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I sit up and stretch my arms above my head.</p><p>He pauses just outside the door, bracing his hands against the doorframe. \u201cBecause he thinks you have a thing for Nova.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does me not going prove that I don\u2019t have a thing for her?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t, but it\u2019ll give him time alone with her.\u201d He rolls up the sleeves of his plaid shirt, reaches for his cigarettes in his pockets, and pops one into his mouth. \u201cI don\u2019t really get why, though. The girl\u2019s seriously crazy sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrazy?\u201d I push up from the bed and head over to the dresser. \u201cShe seems normal to me.\u201d</p><p>He lights the end of his cigarette and puts the lighter into his back pocket. \u201cYeah, but she\u2019s not. Delilah said she went off the deep end when her boyfriend killed himself and she even tried to slit her wrists.\u201d He makes a clicking noise with his tongue as he traces his finger over his wrists. \u201cBut who can blame her? I mean, she was the one who found him dead. That seriously has to screw with someone\u2019s head...\u201d His eyes widen as he pulls an oh-shit face. \u201cFuck, I completely forgot... Shit, man...\u201d He rubs his bald head with his hand that\u2019s holding the cigarette. \u201cLook, I didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you did,\u201d I say in a tight voice, not just pissed off at him for bringing up my painful past, but because he insulted Nova and is talking about her like she\u2019s some kind of freak show. Me, I deserve it, because I caused the agony in my past, but Nova, she didn\u2019t do anything. Something happened to her and it fucking makes me ache, like physically hurt on the inside and out. \u201cNow can you get the fuck out so I can change?\u201d</p><p>His eyes turn cold. \u201cYou better watch how you talk to me. You\u2019re a guest in my house, and I\u2019m not going to let you stay here for much longer if you don\u2019t start paying for rent.\u201d</p><p>I head for the door, my hands balled into fists, wanting so badly to punch him the face. \u201cI\u2019m working on getting a job.\u201d</p><p>He slams his hand against the door as I start to close it. \u201cIf you need a job, I can get you one.\u201d</p><p>I look him over skeptically. \u201cDoing what?\u201d</p><p>He takes a drag from the end of the cigarette, and smoke eases out of his mouth and envelops his face. \u201cI think you know.\u201d</p><p>I do, but what I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m that desperate yet. Yeah, I do drugs, but dealing is a whole other level of crap. \u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d</p><p>He lowers his hand from the door and steps back. \u201cWell, don\u2019t think for too long, otherwise you\u2019re going to miss your chance.\u201d</p><p>I nod, and he backs out into the hall so I can shut the door. I turn in a circle, looking at the pathetic little room that\u2019s become my home, trying to remember how I got here, but the path leading from Lexi\u2019s death to this exact moment is nothing but a blur. I wonder if that\u2019s how Nova feels. I wonder if that\u2019s why she looks so sad all the time. To see something like that\u2014to see death. It\u2019s the kind of thing that scars people on the inside. And not just small scars, but long, thick, jagged ones that never go away. The kind of scars that alter the appearance of things, change people. Ruin them. The only difference is that I put the scars on myself by crashing the goddamn car, while Nova\u2019s were forced on her by someone else\u2019s decision. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I glance down at the drawing of Nova\u2019s eyes and then at the drawing of Lexi on my wall. Images devour my thoughts, yanking me back to the dark moment that changed me forever.</p><p>\u201cQuinton,\u201d Lexi whispers, and even though her eyes are open, they\u2019re glazed over and I can tell she can\u2019t see me. \u201cJust promise me that...\u201d</p><p>Tears stream from my eyes as I lift her head up from the ground and move it onto my lap. Blood immediately soaks my jeans, and in the glow of the moon, I can see blood all over her, me, the ground below us. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby...\u201d I fight back the tears, knowing I have to be strong because I\u2019m not the one hurting. In fact, I feel numb. \u201cI won\u2019t let anything happen to you. I promise.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head from side to side as her breaths become ragged, and she clutches my arms. \u201cJust promise me that you\u2019ll never forget me, no matter what. That you\u2019ll always love me more than anyone else.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I say, with my fingertips pressed to her wrist. I can feel her lethargic pulse, and the longer time goes on, the more time goes on between each beat. \u201cLexi, that\u2019s a stupid thing to say, though, because you\u2019re going to be fine.\u201d I\u2019m lying. She knows it. I know it. Blood is gushing from her body and her limbs are contorted in odd, unnatural angles.</p><p>But I found her phone, and the na\u00efve part of me thinks that if the ambulance can just get here in time, everything will be okay; they can fix her, mend her, put her back together, and erase this entire night.</p><p>I focus on the uneven rhythm of her breathing, knowing it\u2019s fading but praying to God she can hold on. If I can just keep concentrating on it, she\u2019ll keep breathing. She has to.</p><p>\u201cQuinton,\u201d she says in a feeble voice, and I can no longer choke back the tears. Hot tears spill down my cheeks, and I reach up and wipe them away before she can see them. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for sticking my head out of the window.\u201d</p><p>I start to cry, my body trembling as I feel her heart slowing down. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201d I manage to get out. \u201cI should have just pulled the damn car over. Lexi, I\u2019m so fucking sorry. I promise I\u2019ll make this better somehow. I\u2019ll never let go of you. I promise.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlways trying to make things better.\u201d She tries to smile, and it looks crooked and wrong. \u201cOne day you\u2019re going to make someone really happy...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you...\u201d I trail off as she shuts her eyes. It\u2019s the last thing I say to her, and I wish it was the last thing I ever say. Maybe if I lie down with her and try hard enough, I can get my own heart to stop beating.</p><p>I wince, wrenching myself out of the memory. Tears drip from my eyes. I gradually walk up to the drawing of Lexi on the wall beside the window, study the dark lines I put on the paper when I wanted to capture the perfection of her body. \u201cIs it breaking the promise if I\u2019m friends with her? Because I want to be friends with her, despite how much I don\u2019t deserve it. I used to think it was breaking my promise to you, but I don\u2019t know anymore... I blame it on the fact that the old me is trying to push his way through and make me be a good guy again, because she looks so sad and lonely.\u201d I pause, waiting for some sort of sign or answer.</p><p>The room stays silent and I sigh, rubbing my hand across my face, knowing that I should just get it over with. End my life. Say good-bye. Leave the thoughts and memories and self-hatred behind like I\u2019ve wanted to do for a year now instead of wasting space and breaths. But I don\u2019t seem to have it in me. It\u2019s like I\u2019m waiting around for something to happen, even though nothing ever does.</p><p>I back away from the drawing, toward the door, taking more steps into the future, even though I want to remain stuck in the past.</p><p>Chapter 9</p> <p>July 10, Day 56 of Summer Break</p><p>Nova</p><p>I\u2019ve been taking a little break from trailer parks and guys for the last couple of days. It\u2019s been neither a good break nor a bad one, which is becoming the story of my life. Nothing is good. Nothing is bad. Everything just exists, like me floating through life with no direction or meaning.</p><p>Despite my break from trailer park guys, I can\u2019t seem to get Quinton or his sadness out of my head. I want to learn more about him, perhaps find out about the girl in the picture, but he seemed so upset that I even brought her up. I tried to search him on the Internet, even though it felt kind of wrong and nosy on my part. But I was to trying to find something else about him, other than he likes art, he lived in Seattle, and he smokes weed. But there are too many Quinton Carters, and I couldn\u2019t find the one I was looking for, not even on Facebook or any other social media network. The more I search and come up empty-handed, the more frustrated I get, but I think there\u2019s an underlying reason to my frustration, stemming from how I connect Landon to Quinton. It feels like I\u2019ve stepped back into the past again, meeting the sad, haunting guy that carries the weight of the world on his shoulders, and I can\u2019t figure out the reason why.</p><p>I wake up a couple of mornings after it happened, feeling more jumbled than I usually do. I count the seconds it takes the sun to move over the hill line, just like I always do, but there\u2019s no sense of order and comfort this morning. I get out of bed and take a shower, then head to my computer desk and open up Landon\u2019s video file. The longer I stare at it, the more I start wondering what exactly he said on it. Are there answers to my questions? About him? About his life? His thoughts? Stuff about us? Shit, what if there is? What if this whole time the answers have been right here, but my fear and anxiety have been getting in the way.</p><p>I put my finger on the mouse pad and let the cursor hover over the file, something I\u2019ve never done before. My finger shakes as I consider tapping the mouse, clicking the file, letting it open up. I\u2019d get to see his eyes again, watch his lips move as he spoke and took breaths. His heart would be beating and he wouldn\u2019t be silent in a wooden box, at least for the moment of the clip.</p><p>My heart picks up in my chest. What does he say on it? How does he look? What does he feel? How will I see it\u2014see him?</p><p>I instantly pull my hand back, shaking from head to toe, my nerves so contorted and confounded I can barely breathe. I\u2019d almost turned it on, which means what exactly? That I\u2019m starting to move on from him? That I\u2019m starting to move on in my life?</p> <p>\u201cNo... no... no...\u201d I shake my head and shove away from the computer, turning it off, and counting as I race to the bathroom. Running away from the problem, like I always do.</p><p>It\u2019s late afternoon, and this morning\u2019s episode is a shadow of a memory in my mind. After a lot of counting, I was able to calm myself down. I\u2019m sitting on my bed with every picture of Landon I own scattered around me, along with a few psychology books. Beneath the bed is a locked box of Landon\u2019s drawings. They\u2019ve been there since his parents gave them to me. The window is open, the fan on, and I pulled my hair up in a ponytail, trying to reduce the sweat forming on the back of my neck. But even in my denim shorts and grey tank top, my skin is getting a little salty.</p><p>I have the computer opened up and the web camera aimed at me as I search through photo after photo, looking for something in his eyes or expression that\u2019ll give me a clue to why he did it. I can spot sadness in almost all of them, but there has to be more to it than that. He couldn\u2019t have just decided to give up because he was sad.</p><p>\u201cI know there are more pictures than this,\u201d I mutter to myself. I uncross my legs and scoot off the bed, heading for the garage. My mom boxed up a lot of stuff when I went away to college and stacked the boxes on the garage shelves.</p><p>As soon as I step into the garage, I instantly regret it. Too many memories swarm around the drums set in the corner, covered up by a sheet. I haven\u2019t touched them since Landon died; my passion to play died right along with him. He was the one who encouraged me to play, bought me the drums, and shared my love for music. But now it all seems pointless, and I can\u2019t even bring myself to pick up a set of drumsticks.</p><p>I skitter around the drum set and head toward the 1967 sleek, cherry-red Nova parked in the middle of the floor and the bike leaning against it, the last thing my dad touched before his death. Painful memories of everyone I lost hit me from every direction, and I start to count each step as I maintain a steady stride around the car, dragging my hand along the shiny hood. I was never into cars, but my dad always was, and he always tried to get me into them, so I wasn\u2019t surprised when he left the Nova to me in his will. What did surprise me was that he had a will, like he knew he was going to die young and wanted everything planned out before he went.</p><p>Sighing, I remove my hand from the car and grab the box labeled \u201cNova\u2019s Photos\u201d on the bottom shelf near the back. Then I go back to my room and dump the photos out, trying not to cringe at the mess I\u2019ve made or the fact that there are too many photos to keep track off. Landon and I never really went anywhere important, but I loved taking pictures of him. He was so beautiful, and his beauty was only amplified in pictures\u2014like a piece of art that looks plain and ordinary from a distance, but up close the angles and shapes and colors fit perfectly together and create something so amazing it couldn\u2019t possibly exist.</p><p>\u201cKnock, knock,\u201d Delilah says as she enters my room. I haven\u2019t seen her since I got high at Dylan\u2019s house, but that\u2019s because I\u2019ve been avoiding Dylan\u2019s house and she\u2019s been spending most of her free time there. She has an iced coffee in her hand, and her hair is divided into two braids. She\u2019s wearing a pink shirt and cutoffs, she has no makeup on, and she\u2019s wearing a backpack for some reason.</p><p>\u201cPlanning on making a trip back to high school?\u201d I tease as she shuts the door.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Her face contorts in puzzlement.</p><p>I point at the backpack. \u201cWhat\u2019s with that?\u201d</p><p>She glances at the bag on her back. \u201cOh, that.\u201d She jumps on the bed, landing on her knees, and the mattress bounces underneath her weight. The ice swishes in her cup, pictures start to slide to the side, and I work to keep them together on the bed. \u201cI brought goodies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodies?\u201d I ask, grabbing a stack of photos and putting them on my lap.</p><p>Her eyes light up as she removes the backpack off her back and drops it onto the bed. She unzips it, and I\u2019m starting to get really curious about what the hell she\u2019s doing when she takes out a glass pipe and a small plastic bag full of weed.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you get that? And why did you bring it here?</p><p>She opens the bag and picks up a pinch of weed. \u201cFrom Dylan, duh?\u201d</p><p>I align the stack of photos that are on my lap. \u201cOkay, then why did you bring it here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I thought we could have a nice relaxing day together now that I know you\u2019re cool.\u201d She fills the pipe with weed and grabs a lighter out of the backpack. \u201cYou know, I used to try and keep this as far from you as possible, but after the other day...\u201d She trails off as she glances up at my shocked expression. \u201cOkay, well, maybe I totally just misread you. Was it like a onetime thing or something?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what it was.\u201d I try not to look at the pipe and remember how I felt when the smoke first hit my lungs, but it\u2019s hard not to stare at something so wonderful yet potent. \u201cDelilah, why did you lie to me when I asked you if you were smoking weed again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be cool with it. You always seemed like you weren\u2019t, or at least you acted like you didn\u2019t want to try it,\u201d she says, shrugging. \u201cBesides, I didn\u2019t technically lie. I hadn\u2019t been doing it since I left for school... I just started up again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you do it the other day?\u201d There\u2019s accusation in her eyes, like I have no right to be talking about this with her. And she\u2019s right. I really don\u2019t. The truth of the matter is I did smoke weed the other day, and for a few moments I\u2019d actually felt content and soundless on the inside, something I haven\u2019t felt in a long time.</p> <p>\u201cSo do you want to smoke a bowl or not?\u201d she asks with a slight impatience in her tone.</p><p>I wonder what she\u2019d do if I said no. \u201cWhat about my mom? She\u2019s home... what if she comes in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, she just left,\u201d she says, setting the pipe down on her lap. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t want me to, then I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t she smell it, though? When she comes back?\u201d I ask, staring at the pipe. I can almost feel the burn of the weed just from looking at it, along with the brief contentment that followed afterward, and I\u2019m surprised how much my mind craves it.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll, turn the fan on and spray some air freshener around or something,\u201d she replies. \u201cBesides, you\u2019re nineteen. What the hell is she going to do if she catches you? Ground you to your room?\u201d</p> <p>I honestly could picture my mom trying to rationalize it as me mourning and let me off the hook, because she does that a lot, like when I got really drunk and threw up on the kitchen floor, and she found me the next morning passed out beside my vomit.</p><p>\u201cIt okay, Nova,\u201d she\u2019d said, helping me to my feet. \u201cWe... we all make mistakes when we hurt, but we need to find a way for you to deal.\u201d She kept saying we like it was her and me going through it together, like we did with my dad. But not this time. This time it was just me.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to smoke it, you can,\u201d I tell Delilah, selecting a picture of Landon and me lying on our backs in the grass from the seemingly endless stack. I was holding the camera and held it above us to snap the shot. I\u2019m laughing in it and Landon looks like he wants to be anywhere else but getting his picture taken. If I remember right, though, he was particularly irritated that day with everything.</p><p>I keep sorting through the pictures while Delilah turns on the ceiling fan, relaxes against the headboard of my twin bed, and starts smoking the weed. Smoke fills the room quickly, moving lazily around my face, and the air stinks like some sort of pungent weed burning in a field.</p><p>\u201cYou two look really beautiful together,\u201d she says, leaning forward and examining the photos closely.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess,\u201d I mumble, because honestly I always believed Landon was out of my league in the looks department.</p> <p>\u201cYou look happy,\u201d she remarks. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen you that happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you need anything to eat or something?\u201d I try for a subject change.</p><p>She shakes her head and takes another hit, and her lips pucker as she blows out a cloud of smoke. \u201cDo you ever think you\u2019ll love someone again?\u201d she asks, and I frown at her. \u201cWhat? I\u2019m just curious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never been curious before.\u201d Which is why I love hanging out with you.</p><p>\u201cI know, but it doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t wonder.\u201d She sighs and sucks in another drag from the pipe.</p><p>I try to stay focused on the photos, but the room\u2019s getting cloudier, along with my head. Eventually she places the pipe and lighter on my nightstand and lies down, staring at the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cSo my mom had this guy over the other day,\u201d she divulges. \u201cAnd he grabbed my ass.\u201d</p><p>My head whips up from the photo. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>She nods, without looking at me. \u201cYeah, but it\u2019s how it\u2019s always been, ever since, you know\u2014\u201d she points at her chest \u201c\u2014these bad boys came into the picture.\u201d</p><p>Delilah rarely talks about her mom, but from what I\u2019ve picked up, she works for a \u201cservice\u201d that helps men with their problems. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s an escort service or a phone chat service or what, and I\u2019ve never met her mom, because Delilah\u2019s never taken me over to her house before.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cAs okay as I\u2019ve always been,\u201d she replies emotionlessly.</p><p>She reaches for the pipe and puts it to her mouth, holding the lighter above it as her eyes remain on the ceiling. I look at the large quantity of photos on my bed, then press my fingers to the bottom of my eyes, my head pounding from the smoke and the emotions flowing through my body. From the outside, these pictures create a life spent together, and I wonder what I would be doing if Landon was still around. If I would be somewhere else, with a future ahead of me, with him. Or would I have ended up in this exact place, getting high and trying to find out who the hell I am without Landon? Maybe we wouldn\u2019t have lasted and I\u2019d have ended up crushed by a breakup instead of his death. Maybe I was destined to get to the exact moment. Maybe this is where I really belong. Perhaps he really knew this was how I would turn out, and that was why it was so easy for him to leave me behind.</p><p>Delilah starts coughing as smoke rings around her face. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want any?\u201d She offers me the pipe.</p><p>I try to think of a reason why I shouldn\u2019t do it, but again I can\u2019t find one. So I take a hit, both terrified and relieved that I do it because it\u2019s still so unknown yet vaguely familiar and brings me so much quiet. I couldn\u2019t even count to ten if I wanted to, and my thoughts are just a haze in my head. We lie on my bed, talking about music and classes and the time I barfed my guts out in the campus garbage cans after I downed nearly a half a bottle of tequila.</p><p>My mom eventually comes home, and we hurry and spray perfume everywhere and throw open all the windows. She sticks her head inside to check on me and asks if we want anything to eat. She either doesn\u2019t notice the smell or doesn\u2019t want to admit she does. Or she\u2019s just letting me off the hook again.</p><p>\u201cI have cookie dough,\u201d she tells Delilah when Delilah asks for cookie dough ice cream. Her tone is clipped and she seems very uncomfortable. My mom\u2019s never been a fan of Delilah or her reputation around town, but she\u2019ll never say anything rude directly to Delilah. It\u2019s not the kind of person she is.</p><p>\u201cThat works,\u201d Delilah says, swiveling in the computer chair as she pretends like she\u2019s been looking through my CD collection.</p><p>\u201cAnd what about you, Nova,\u201d my mom asks me, looking a little bit upset. I wonder if she can smell the weed or see it in my eyes. Does she know what I was just doing? \u201cDo you want anything to snack on? You can come help me cook dinner if you want. I\u2019m making your favorite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is my favorite?\u201d I ask. Delilah laughs, but I wasn\u2019t trying to be funny. I really don\u2019t know anymore what my favorite food or color or even song is.</p><p>\u201cFettucine alfredo,\u201d my mom says, and her blue eyes look like they\u2019re watering up.</p><p>Feeling a ping of guilt, I gesture at the photos on my bed. \u201cI\u2019m going through these right now. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>She sighs, heartbroken, and I feel my heart crack, but the numbness from smoking instantly seals it up, and then I can\u2019t feel anything at all. She backs out of the room and leaves us alone in our dazed stupidity and all I can think is: Where do I go from here?</p><p>The only answer I get is silence.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>July 27, Day 69 of Summer Break</p><p>Nova</p><p>I\u2019ve been getting lost a lot lately. Not only from my counting and thoughts of Landon, but also because I\u2019ve been spending a lot of time with Delilah and doing and smoking things I shouldn\u2019t, and I keep doing it because honestly it makes me feel better, at least for a moment, until it\u2019s passed through my system, and then it feels like I\u2019m impatiently waiting around for the next better moment to come around again.</p><p>I still stick to my morning routine, though, counting the seconds it takes for the sun to rise over the hill, then I get out of bed and take a shower. I always spend my five minutes in front of the computer staring at Landon\u2019s video file. I haven\u2019t come close to clicking on it again, and I\u2019m thankful for it. I don\u2019t think my mind could handle another panic attack over it or handle actually clicking on it and watching it. I only stare at it, letting my mind know it\u2019s there\u2014letting me know he\u2019s there.</p><p>Delilah was over here about an hour ago, yammering about the concert, while we shared a joint, something we\u2019ve been doing a lot. She\u2019s been pushing me to go for the last two weeks and I keep declining, because: (a) I\u2019m afraid of what memories will surface, because Landon and I used to go to concerts all the time; and (b) I\u2019m terrified of being around Quinton. I avoided him since our awkward kiss, and I\u2019m nervous about what he\u2019ll say when I see him again and what I\u2019ll say too because deep down I know I\u2019m not one hundred percent seeing him as him.</p><p>It\u2019s stifling today, but I\u2019m outside anyway, in my cutoffs and a really thin purple tank top with my hair pulled up. I smell a little like smoke mixed with the scent of the perfume I used to try and cover up the stench of the weed stuck in the fabric of my clothes and in my hair. I\u2019m sitting on the swing that\u2019s on the front porch of my little one-story home, counting every single time it moves back and forth, trying to air my hair and clothes out. Just diagonal is a large oak tree that holds one of my most genuine, life-changing memories. It\u2019s centered in the middle of the green grass that lines the front of the two-story house that Dylan used to live in. I have my foot under me and the swing rocks back and forth.</p><p>\u201cAll right, Nova, we\u2019re heading out,\u201d my mom says as she walks out the front door. She has a purse on her shoulder, the car keys in her hand. She\u2019s wearing slacks and a satin top, and her hair is in a bun.</p><p>I remember when she was with my dad, and her hair was long with tangled waves and tiny braids throughout it. She would wear long, flowing dresses, and she reminded me so much of a hippie, all love, peace, and happiness. I miss those days; the ones where she\u2019d laugh freely and her smile would brighten up her face. She\u2019s a different person now, and although I don\u2019t doubt that she\u2019s truly happy, I wonder about the difference between her happiness when she was with my dad versus her happiness with Daniel. She\u2019s more of a controlled happy now. She finds different things funny, and in a sense she\u2019s a different person, one who\u2019s harder to talk to.</p><p>I wave at her as Daniel walks out the door wearing a polo shirt and black slacks. He\u2019s pulling a suitcase behind him and has a granola bar in his hand. \u201cIf you need anything, call us,\u201d he says, stepping down the stairs, dragging the suitcase along with him. They\u2019re going to a resort for the weekend to celebrate their four-year anniversary, but I can tell my mom is hesitant to go and leave me behind. She\u2019s been talking about canceling it for the last week, pretending like she\u2019s too busy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I stand up to give my mom a hug good-bye.</p><p>She wraps her arms around me, squeezing me way too tightly, and I wonder if she can smell the weed on me or if I\u2019ve aired out enough. \u201cIf you need anything\u2014anything at all, call us.\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cGod, I feel guilty for even leaving at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m nineteen years old,\u201d I tell her. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve been living on my own for almost a year now. I\u2019m fine.\u201d I draw back. \u201cNow go have fun on your trip.\u201d</p><p>She presses her lips together and stares at me directly through my sunglasses, and I wonder what she sees. Does she know what I\u2019ve been doing? Can she tell how lost I am? That I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing? That I\u2019m not sure who I am anymore? Can she still see her daughter thriving inside, or is the Nova she gave birth to, raised, tried to shape into a good person with values, gone?</p> <p>She sighs, hitching her thumb under the strap of her purse and heads for the stairs. \u201cI love you, Nova.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you too.\u201d I sit back down on the swing again, feeling guilty about all my bad decisions, but it quickly vanishes through the lingering high inside my head. They load up the car and back out of the driveway, and she watches me the entire time, looking away only as they reach the corner. Then everything gets quiet; even the neighborhood has decided to bask in the silence. I rock in the swing for a while, and even though my eyes aren\u2019t focused on his house, my mind still is.</p><p>I take my phone out of my pocket, flick the screen to turn on the video, and aim it at Landon\u2019s old house. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t live there anymore or anything, but I kind of feel tied to it. Maybe it\u2019s because I spent so much time there, engulfed in everything he did.\u201d I wiggle my foot out from beneath me and place it down on the concrete patio. \u201cNot too long after he died, his parents moved out, and now the porch is littered with bicycles and toys, and in the backyard on the hill where I once lay beside him, there\u2019s now a swing set.\u201d I slant to the side, so I can get a shot of the backyard and the hill that dips down to the fence line. \u201cIt\u2019s like he doesn\u2019t even exist anymore... like he never did... but he still does to me, inside my heart. In fact, he still owns it.\u201d</p><p>The door creaks open, and my heart pounds deafeningly inside my chest... It matches the beat of the music as he hangs lifelessly from a rope.... His skin is so pale, like snow, and his eyes are still open, like he\u2019s still there, holding them open...</p><p>I slap my hand across my face, hard, wanting to get the hell out of my own head. My sunglasses fly off my head, and the pain erupts up my cheek as my ears start to ring and my eyes start to water. My skin is tender; I clutch my cheek, tears stinging my eyes, sorry for not thinking before I act. It hurts. Badly. But so does the memory.</p> <p>I wait until my heart settles and my adrenaline balances out. I take a deep breath and another, then sit up straight and rotate the camera around, so I show up on the screen. There\u2019s a bright red handprint on my cheek, and I wonder if it\u2019s going to leave a bruise. \u201cSometimes I wonder how unhealthy my attachment is to him. I mean, is it normal to feel like this after over a year has passed? But who\u2019s to say what\u2019s normal and what\u2019s not. Who\u2019s to say anything, really, because it always seems like everyone is saying a bunch of different things and we don\u2019t make sense to each other. At least that\u2019s how it is for me. Nothing makes sense anymore...\u201d I trail off, glancing up as Delilah\u2019s truck pulls into the driveway.</p><p>I\u2019m surprised, because I thought she was heading out to the concert. She parks the truck and hops out, waving at me, and I notice that there are two other people in the truck. The passenger door swings open and Quinton jumps out, followed by Dylan.</p><p>\u201cHey, Nova Dova,\u201d she singsongs, energetically skipping around the front of the truck. She\u2019s changed her outfit from this morning into a pair of maroon corduroy shorts and a white tank top. Her auburn hair touches her shoulders, and she has an array of colorful bracelets on her wrists. \u201cAre you making one of your videos?\u201d Her jaw drops as she nears me, her eyes fixing on my swollen cheek. \u201cDid you get in a fight while I was gone?\u201d</p><p>I drop the phone to my lap and click off the recorder. \u201cNo,\u201d I lie. \u201cI fell out of the swing and hit my face on the floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d She trots up the steps.</p><p>I nod. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p> <p>Quinton and Dylan are talking to each other in hushed voices at the bottom of the steps, and Quinton looks like he\u2019s getting annoyed. Dylan\u2019s got a hood pulled over his head, which doesn\u2019t make any sense since it\u2019s blistering hot. Quinton has on a black-shirt on and a pair of faded jeans. His jawline is scruffy and there\u2019s a tiny bit of black smeared on the upper section of his cheekbone.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I ask as she stops in front of the swing. \u201cI thought you were taking off for the concert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are but we came here to pick you up,\u201d she says, folding her arms.</p><p>Dylan steps up to the porch and drapes an arm around her shoulders, his gaze focused on me. \u201cWhoa, what happened to your face?\u201d His slides the hood off his head and rubs his hand over his bald head.</p><p>\u201cI fell,\u201d I respond robotically, covering my cheek with my hand.</p><p>His face contorts as he takes in the gnarly welt. \u201cYou look like shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I answer drly.</p><p>Delilah elbows him in the gut. \u201cDon\u2019t be a dick.\u201d</p> <p>His gaze bores into her, and Delilah cowers back as his jaw tightens. \u201cSo are you down, Nova?\u201d he asks, still scowling at Delilah.</p><p>\u201cDown for what?\u201d I ask nervously, rocking the swing.</p><p>\u201cFor the concert.\u201d He diverts his attention to his watch, and Delilah releases an uneven breath. \u201cWe have to go buy some camping shit from the store, go back to my house and get Tristan\u2019s fucking car packed and then hit the road soon if we\u2019re going to make it in time to hear the opening band.\u201d</p><p>Quinton steps up beside them and leans back against one of the porch columns. I pretend he\u2019s not there, looking at me with those honey-brown eyes I\u2019ve been hiding from.</p><p>I slip off my sandals and let my feet drag against the floor as I swing back and forth. \u201cI already told Delilah that I changed my mind about going.\u201d I can\u2019t do it. I\u2019m not that strong. It\u2019s too much.</p><p>Delilah shakes her head and waves a finger at me. \u201cNo way. You said you\u2019d go and you\u2019re going. I will not let you sit around here and mope all week.\u201d</p><p>I sift through my thoughts, trying to think past the numbers floating in my head. One, two, three, four, take a deep breath. \u201cMy mom needs me home this weekend,\u201d I lie, scowling at her, because I know what she\u2019s up to. She thinks that because she showed up here with Quinton, she can get me to go.</p><p>\u201cYour mom left for her vacation.\u201d She elevates her eyebrows accusingly. \u201cI was here this morning while she was packing, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, you\u2019re the only reason I\u2019m going.\u201d Quinton straightens out his leg across the porch and nudges my foot with his. His eyes are bloodshot, like they almost always are, and I can smell the scent of pot flowing off him. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty fucked up to bail out now and leave me hanging.\u201d He gives me a smile and I get caught up in it for a minute, until I remember everything that happened between us and how he just walked out and started talking to Nikki, forgetting about everything in the time it took for me to catch my breath.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll live,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find someone else to take.\u201d</p><p>His tongue slips out of his mouth and he licks his lips, and then presses them together, looking remorseful. \u201cNo, I can\u2019t. And I don\u2019t... and I don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>Delilah teasingly swats my arm. \u201cCome on, Nova, just come and have fun.\u201d She skips over to the front door and fumbles with the handle, before opening up the screen. \u201cI\u2019m going to go pack your stuff up, and then we have to make a stop at the sporting goods store.\u201d She walks into my house and Dylan tags along behind her, the door banging shut behind them.</p><p>I get up from the swing and trudge toward the front door, preparing to fight with her over going when Quinton\u2019s fingers enfold around my arm and he lures me back to him. \u201cHey... about what happened? I didn\u2019t mean any of it.\u201d</p><p>I glance over my shoulder at him, the sunlight blinding and reflecting in his eyes. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to apologize. I know I\u2019m not as much fun as Nikki is to hang out with. And I\u2019m really sorry I cried when you kissed me...\u201d I swallow hard. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t really about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what was it about?\u201d he asks, sounding genuinely interested.</p><p>\u201cThe past...\u201d My gaze aimlessly wanders to house on the other side of the street. \u201cAnd the fact that it all caught up with me.\u201d</p><p>His brows groove and then he shakes his head. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to leave you in the bed like that. I just kind of woke up and panicked, you know, because you were there in my bed.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t get what he\u2019s saying and with the way he keeps blinking, I doubt he even does. \u201cQuinton... what do you want from me?\u201d It\u2019s a strange question and a glimpse into the awkwardness that once used to radiate from me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I apologize and turn for the door. \u201cThat came out weirder than I planned.\u201d</p><p>He hauls me back before I make it too far, maneuvers me around him, and steers me back against the railing, until the wood is scraping at my skin through the fabric of my shirt. He scans my face over and his lips dip downward at the sight of my cheek, then he quickly wrenches his gaze away from it, like it hurts to look at it\u2014or me.</p><p>He bends over a little to look me in the eye and the nearness of him is overpowering to the point that I actually want to touch him. \u201cI know I don\u2019t know you that well and I\u2019m not that good with people, but I\u2019d like us to be friends.\u201d</p><p>Friends. Is that what I want from him? I cross my arms behind my back so I\u2019ll keep my hands to myself. \u201cYou want to be friends with me? Really?\u201d</p><p>He nods, delicately cupping his hand on my injured cheek, careful not to press down too hard. \u201cYeah, I like you Nova. You\u2019re very...\u201d He racks his brain for the right word. \u201cAmusing,\u201d he finishes, and the corners of his lips quirk, but he battles the smile swelling through. \u201cWhat do you say? Will you be my friend, Nova Reed?\u201d</p><p>I feel like I\u2019m a kid again and the boy across the street is asking me if I want to hang out. I want to say that I\u2019m getting in over my head. That I\u2019m too unbalanced and confused to be around him, but as he continues to stare at me with his honey-brown eyes, streaked red and brimming with despair, I feel my doubts melting and I find myself nodding.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I tell him. \u201cWe can be friends, if that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>He pauses with a flicker of misery appearing in his eyes, but it promptly disappears. \u201cThat\u2019s what I want.\u201d A smile expands at his lips, but I wonder how real it is. How can I tell? \u201cNow, can you do me a huge favor?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUm... sure. What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you please, pretty please, come to the concert with me? I don\u2019t want to be alone with those two.\u201d He nods his head at the front door.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be alone, though,\u201d I say. \u201cIsn\u2019t Tristan going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is,\u201d he says with a teasing grin. \u201cBut it\u2019d be weird with the two of us.\u201d</p> <p>I roll my eyes, pretending to be annoyed, but the lightness in his voice is working its way into my heart. \u201cI think you stole that line from me, but it really makes no sense when you say it.\u201d</p><p>His grins broadens and again, I wonder just how much of it\u2014of him\u2014is real. \u201cI know, but it worked for you, so I figured it could work for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuinton, I really don\u2019t\u2014\u201d I start, but he places his other hand over my lips, silencing me.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Nova... I don\u2019t want to be alone.\u201d His skin is meltingly warm, and there\u2019s pleading in his tone that stifles the conflict inside me. I\u2019m terrified to death of going and disrupting my order so much, but the way he says he doesn\u2019t want to be alone, with such anguish, temporarily kills the anxiety inside me.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll go,\u201d I say, mentally counting the times Landon and I went to concerts\u2014eight\u2014tracking the past, while I move toward the future. I\u2019m actually doing this? Oh my God. What\u2019s going to happen? Am I going to lose control? Going to fall apart?</p> <p>He smiles, drawing both his hands away, and taking a step back, putting a little space between us. \u201cNow do you want to tell me why you have a handprint on your cheek?\u201d</p><p>Sealing my lips together, I shake my head, knowing I can\u2019t say I fell because he noticed it was a handprint. \u201cNo,\u201d I say, rubbing my finger along the smudge of charcoal on his cheek, something I used to do with Landon all the time.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He flexes his fingers at his sides as I pull my hand away. \u201cWould you at least let me put some ice on it?\u201d</p><p>I nod, and he offers me his hand. I take it, knowing I\u2019m choosing to put myself out on a tightrope, and all I can do is cross my fingers that I\u2019ll make it across and that there\u2019s something to make it across to.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>Quinton</p> <p>I\u2019m a terrible fucking person. I\u2019ve known it for a year and three months now. The once-good guy who wanted to be an artist and start a family died in the accident and was never revived. Now there\u2019s just loser, stoner, drifter Quinton.</p><p>I used to be the kind of guy who loved to help everyone, even when it meant helping Lexi mourn over her dead dog. I was the kind of guy in high school who was friends with pretty much everyone. I volunteered to tutor the kids who had a harder time in school, and every year I\u2019d help out at the homeless shelter during Christmas and Thanksgiving, just like my mom did, although I never did get to see her in action. I just heard stories, on the rare occasions my dad would talk about her, and saw a few pictures. I guess I stupidly believed that being good like her would bring me closer to her, but the only time I really got closer to her was when I was lying on the ground after the accident with my chest bleeding out as my heart willingly stopped beating. I\u2019d made peace with dying, and now I made peace with the dark road I\u2019m stumbling down.</p><p>But there are always a few rare instances when the good and the bad coexist, and sometimes I can\u2019t figure out if I\u2019m making a good decision or a bad one. Like when I asked Nova to be my friend. I haven\u2019t had any real friends for a very long time and for a lot of good reasons. But even though I\u2019m fucked up, for some goddamn reason I still think I can help her not look so sad. And after the moment passes, and I realize that I can barely keep myself together let alone help someone else deal with their own problems, it\u2019s too late and I\u2019m already in a sporting goods store shopping with her. Dylan and Delilah went out back with one of the cashiers to make a deal and left me and Nova to get everything on the list. We\u2019re wandering around, looking for tents and coolers and \u201chot dog pokey stick thingys,\u201d as Nova put it.</p><p>\u201cHot dog pokey stick thingys?\u201d I question with a cock of my eyebrow as I steer the cart around the corner while reading what\u2019s on the list.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you know.\u201d She makes this weird stabbing movement with her hand like she\u2019s trying to reenact the shower scene in Psycho. \u201cThose metal pole things that you use to roast hot dogs over fires.\u201d</p><p>I restrain a smile. She\u2019s being too fucking cute for her own good. \u201cI think they\u2019re just called hot dog forks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d Her expression twists with disappointment as she clutches her phone in her hand. She\u2019s been holding on to the thing since we left the house, like she\u2019s worried if she puts it away she\u2019ll lose it or something. \u201cThat totally lacks creativity.\u201d</p><p>I toss a sleeping bag into the cart. \u201cYeah, I like your name for them better.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMe too,\u201d she says, detouring down one of the aisles. She pauses to lean over my shoulder and read the list. Her hair tickles my cheek, and the contact nearly drives my body mad. \u201cJeez, outdoor concerts must be a big deal or something... there\u2019s so much stuff we have to get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never been to one?\u201d I stop the cart when she halts in front of the flashlight section, examining it with her hands on her hips.</p><p>She shakes her head, leaning away from me. \u201cNope, you guys get to pop that cherry.\u201d Her face instantly turns red as soon as she says it.</p><p>Millions of comments run around my head, but I decide to let her off the hook. \u201cWell, the list says we\u2019ll need sleeping bags, tents, lanterns, foam padding, and a lunch box.\u201d</p><p>Still looking embarrassed, she picks up a yellow flashlight from the shelf. \u201cWhat about flashlights instead of lanterns? They\u2019re cheaper.\u201d</p><p>I shrug and stuff the list into my back pocket. \u201cAll this shit is for Dylan. I already have most of it.\u201d</p><p>She makes a disgusted face and drops the flashlight back on the shelf. \u201cThen we better get everything on the list,\u201d she says with a frown.</p><p>\u201cNot a fan of him, huh?\u201d I ask, pushing the cart forward again.</p><p>She pulls an apologetic face. \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t mean for that to come out so rude. He just makes me uneasy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cYeah, really.\u201d</p><p>This seems to make her happy, and her steps lighten as she walks into the next aisle. She has a funny way to her walk, like she\u2019s trying to make all her steps even, and I\u2019m not sure if she\u2019s doing it on purpose, but she keeps stepping over the cracks in the tile. I thought I smelled a hint of weed beneath her perfume when we were back at her house, and I wonder if she\u2019d been smoking it or something. Maybe she\u2019s high, and that\u2019s why she\u2019s acting a little off. I\u2019m not sure, though. Since she doesn\u2019t look very stoned. And I don\u2019t get why she\u2019d be smoking it. It didn\u2019t seem like she was an expert when she smoked it at my house.</p><p>\u201cNova, are you okay?\u201d I ask, as she continues to walk up the aisle, staring up at the signs above our heads. There\u2019s a really old school song playing from the store speakers, and her lips are moving to the lyrics.</p><p>She peers over her shoulder at me, her skin looking soft under the light, her eyes a dark blue, and her lips shiny with gloss. \u201cYeah, why?\u201d</p><p>I glance down at her feet. \u201cBecause it looks like you\u2019re walking funny.\u201d</p><p>She stops walking and stares at her flip flops. There\u2019s this gnarly scar on the top of her foot. \u201cYeah, my feet hurt a little bit.\u201d</p><p>I inch the cart up to her. \u201cHop in then, and I\u2019ll give you a ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d she says looking alarmed.</p><p>\u201cA... yeah.\u201d I\u2019m really confused.</p><p>She eyes the cart and then me before she climbs in, situating herself around the boxes and sleeping bag. She looks uncomfortable with her knees pulled up and her chin resting on them as she grips her phone in her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t crash it, please,\u201d she says.</p><p>Her words stab me like a piece of jagged metal, and my heart pulses beneath my scar, reminding me how I got here and who I am and how in no way do I deserve to be here, in this world, this life. With her.</p><p>Nova</p><p>When he tells me to get in the cart, I seriously about have a heart attack. Because I\u2019m walking around, counting each step, making sure to step over the cracks in the floor while I clutch my phone for dear life.</p><p>When I\u2019d went into my room to pack, I\u2019d realized just how bad my routine was going to be disrupted. Not only would I be surrounded my madness and disorder, but my morning routine would be ruined. Sure I could count the seconds it takes for the sun to rise over the hill line, but I couldn\u2019t stare at Landon\u2019s file for the usual five minutes, and the idea of not being able to nearly made me flip out. I tried to take my computer, but Delilah gave me this huge lecture about computers not belonging at concerts. In a panic, I\u2019d sent the file to my phone, and now I can\u2019t seem to let my phone go, afraid that I\u2019ll lose the file or something.</p><p>And I\u2019ve never been to this store before, and I don\u2019t know where anything is. Plus, there\u2019s these giant animal heads mounted on the wall in chaotic, uneven rows, and it\u2019s making me anxious.</p><p>Then he gives me an out to the controlled footsteps and I want it, yet I don\u2019t at the same time. I end up climbing in the cart, clutching my phone and asking him not to crash it please. For some reason, that makes him tense. Then he pushes the cart forward, without saying anything, and I can tell he\u2019s upset and I don\u2019t want him to be.</p><p>My dad used to say then when someone\u2019s upset and you don\u2019t know why, say something random because it\u2019ll make them smile. I never did this with Landon, because I was too afraid he\u2019d think I was crazy, and I\u2019m not particularly fond of randomness. I don\u2019t know if Quinton will smile, but it\u2019s worth it if it means getting him to smile again.</p><p>\u201cDo you know that bears are bowlegged,\u201d I say and try not to laugh when he gapes at me. I point up to one of the bears on the wall. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell because only half of the body is up there, but it\u2019s totally true.\u201d</p><p>He stares at me blankly and then with his forehead creased, he starts laughing. \u201cPlease tell me why you chose to share that little fact with me.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI have no idea, but it got you to smile.\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head, he tries to gain control over his smile, but finally he gives up and grinning, he pushes the cart forward. We start talking about music as we load up the cart around me with all the stuff on Dylan\u2019s list. When we reach the tent area, Quinton insists that we need to try out the ones on display in order to know which one is the best to buy.</p><p>So I stand up, finally put my phone into my pocket so that I can swing my leg over the cart. He takes my hand and helps me to the floor safely. Then, still holding hands, we crawl into one of the smaller domed tents and lie down on our backs.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d he asks, our hands intertwined between us. \u201cIs it first-time-cherry-popping worthy?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I bite down on my lip. I couldn\u2019t believe when that slipped out of my mouth, and I\u2019m blaming it on my current inability to make good, coherent sentences before I speak. \u201cMaybe, but I thought this was Dylan\u2019s tent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d he says. \u201cI was just curious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what kinds of tents I like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout the things you like.\u201d</p> <p>He waits for me to say what I like, but I can\u2019t, because I really don\u2019t know anymore what I like and what I want.</p><p>We climb out of the tent and start wandering around the store again, trying to decide which tent to get, still holding hands for no other reason than neither one of us can seem to find a reason to let go.</p><p>\u201cI like the purple tent,\u201d I say as we stand in the section where the boxes of tents are stacked. I have my free hand on my pocket, reminding me that my phone is there\u2014the video is there.</p><p>He rakes his fingers through his brown hair, using the hand that\u2019s holding on to my hand, so I get to feel how soft his hair is. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m not sure if Dylan will be too stoked to have a purple tent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right,\u201d I say.</p> <p>He cocks his head to the side as he studies the selection and then fixes his eyes on me. \u201cYou know what, he can have whatever tent we get him, since he\u2019s the one who made us do his shopping for him.\u201d</p><p>I giggle as he picks up the purple tent and drops it into the cart. He smiles at the sound of my laughter, and I smile, too, as we head up to the register. With our fingers still laced, we use our free hands to load up the conveyer belt. It\u2019s extremely awkward, maneuvering around the cart together, but I\u2019m finding it amusing and kind of fun, which makes it hard to let go of his hand.</p><p>\u201cYou know, we should make a game of this,\u201d he says, setting a sleeping bag down.</p><p>I take a lantern out of the cart. \u201cOut of what?\u201d</p><p>He glances down at our hands clasped together. \u201cOut of how long we can do this.\u201d</p><p>I feel a little guilty that we\u2019re still gripping onto each other, but it\u2019s comfortable\u2014familiar and comforting\u2014and I don\u2019t want to stop. \u201cWhat does the winner get?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, technically we\u2019d both be winners since we both would let go at the same time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point.\u201d</p><p>Smiling to himself, he resumes piling stuff on the belt, and I do, too. But the longer our hands stay joined, the sweatier my hand gets, and finally the comforting sensation leaves my body and I pull away, noting that it was my hand that left his first.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>July 28, Day 70 of Summer Break</p><p>Quinton</p><p>Nova and I finish up at the store, keeping our hands to ourselves, making light conversation that in no way gives me any insight as to who she really is inside. Sometimes she seems happy to be with me and sometimes sad, and by the time we make it to the trailer park she looks like she\u2019s going to cry. She wanders into Dylan\u2019s room with Delilah, and I have a suspicion that they\u2019re getting high. Part of me wants to go back there and stop her, but the part of me, the druggie inside, knows I\u2019d be a fucking hypocrite if I lecture her for doing something I do every day, so instead I stay outside and load up the car. Eventually Nova and Delilah come back outside and start cooking hot dogs over a rusty barbecue grill on the porch. We all eat them and then get ready to hit the road.</p><p>We leave later than planned. It\u2019s little after midnight when we pile into Tristan\u2019s Cadillac, with our suitcases, tents, sleeping bags, and all the other shit Nova and I picked up at the store piled in the trunk. The stars are out, but it\u2019s a little cloudy, so they look like distant dots hidden by a wispy veil. I\u2019d sketch it because it\u2019s one of those rare sights that should be recorded, but I\u2019m squished between the door and Nova, who\u2019s searching through videos on her phone.</p> <p>Tristan is driving, and Dylan made Delilah sit in the backseat, even though she said it makes her carsick. He told her he didn\u2019t give a shit, and I really don\u2019t think he does. He wants to sit up front where it\u2019s roomier and he can rest back and get some sleep. Nova chooses to sit by me, and I both love and hate that she did. And it really makes me want to get high, but I won\u2019t smoke in the car. I\u2019d never put any of their lives at risk by smoking in the car and getting everyone, including the driver, stoned.</p><p>\u201cIt smells like dirty socks,\u201d Nova remarks, scrunching her nose as she scrolls through video clips on her phone.</p><p>Delilah giggles next to her. \u201cIt\u2019s probably Dylan\u2019s feet. They stink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut the fuck up,\u201d Dylan complains from the front seat, kicking his boots up onto the dashboard. \u201cI still have my shoes on.\u201d</p><p>Nova\u2019s eyes elevate from her phone and settle on me. \u201cIs it you?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, confining a smile. \u201cI still have my shoes on, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you always have your laces undone.\u201d She says it more as a question than a statement. Her fingers wrap securely around her phone and she hugs it against her chest.</p><p>\u201cBecause it makes it easier to slip them off,\u201d I say, trying not to dig too deep into the fact that she noticed this minor detail about me. \u201cAnd easier to put on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She glances back at her phone, but doesn\u2019t do anything but stare at the black screen.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my feet,\u201d Tristan shamelessly admits as he veers the car onto the desolate highway. \u201cBut if I\u2019m stuck driving, you all are just going to have to deal with it, because I\u2019m going to be comfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one made you drive,\u201d Dylan says, cracking the window so he can smoke. \u201cYou just did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause no one else offered,\u201d he retorts, flipping on the high beams. The road in front of us lights up, every twist and turn, and every single tree. There\u2019s no one on the road, and it makes me apprehensive. It\u2019s not like I haven\u2019t been in a car since the accident, but I\u2019m also usually high whenever I get into a vehicle. I didn\u2019t have time to light up before we drove off, and there\u2019s no way I\u2019m smoking it in the car when I have other people in it. Being sober in a car painfully forces me to think about the accident and how in a blink of an eye we all could be gone.</p><p>Nova lets out an exhausted sigh as she drops her phone on the seat between Delilah and herself. \u201cWe should play a game,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cLike spin the bottle,\u201d Tristan suggests, smiling at her in the rearview mirror.</p><p>She frowns as she tips her head down, pieces of her hair curtaining her face. \u201cNo, like I spy or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the stupidest game ever,\u201d Dylan snaps from the front seat. His head flops back against the headrest, and his hand rests on the windowsill so the cigarette ashes can blow freely outside. He\u2019s been pretty moody lately\u2014well, moodier than normal\u2014which means he\u2019s probably coming down from something a lot rougher than pot.</p><p>Delilah unfastens her seat belt, and it makes my stomach somersault as she slides forward in the seat to massage the back of Dylan\u2019s neck. \u201cRelax, babe,\u201d she says, moving her fingers in circles along his neck. \u201cTry to get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>Dylan mutters something as he puffs on his cigarette. \u201cThis is such bullshit.\u201d</p><p>I move my attention from them to Nova, because looking at her makes my heart calm down a little, especially since she has her seat belt on. It gives me a sense of peace, even though I don\u2019t have my own on.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your face feeling?\u201d I ask her, observing her enflamed cheek.</p><p>She pouts out her bottom lip as she covers her cheek with her hand. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to bruise, even after you put the ice on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ice was for the swelling.\u201d I resist the urge to put a hand on her cheek, because I need to stop touching her so much. \u201cAnd it\u2019ll probably bruise, but it\u2019ll go away eventually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she replies, disheartened. \u201cBut it hurts and I need a distraction. That\u2019s why I wanted to play the game. Well, that and my dad and I used to play it all the time when we\u2019d take road trips.\u201d She sucks her lip between her teeth, looking sadder than someone whose dog just died. \u201cSorry, that probably makes me sound like a little kid, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it makes you sound like someone who misses her dad.\u201d I stare out the window at the lofty trees and fence lining the road, thinking about my dad back at home, all alone, living in a house packed with memories of my mom. \u201cI spy something green,\u201d I say. I wait for Nova to say something, but when she doesn\u2019t, I turn my head toward her. \u201cWhat? Now you don\u2019t want to play?\u201d</p><p>Her expression is unreadable. \u201cNo, I just didn\u2019t think anyone would actually play a game with me.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cWhat can I say? I guess I\u2019m a sucker for those sad, puppy-dog eyes of yours...\u201d As soon as it slips out, I want to retract it. It\u2019s not a friend thing to say. It\u2019s a flirty, I\u2019m-going-to-try-and-fuck-you-later thing to say. And I shouldn\u2019t be flirting with her or thinking about fucking her. Plus, Tristan\u2019s in the car and the last thing I want to do is piss him off, especially after how nice he\u2019s been to me, all things considering.</p><p>By the look on Nova\u2019s face, I think she knows I\u2019m flirting with her, and I bite my tongue, wondering what the hell is going to come out of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cThe grass,\u201d she guesses breezily, letting me off the hook.</p><p>I frown, disappointed by her answer. \u201cThat\u2019s seriously your guess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat.\u201d She bats her eyelashes innocently at me. \u201cIt\u2019s green.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNova.\u201d I shake my head, pretending to be severely displeased in her answer. \u201cYour lack of creativity is alarmingly disappointing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, not all of us our artists,\u201d she retorts. \u201cBut if you think you\u2019re so creative, then let\u2019s see how good you are.\u201d She thrums her finger on her chin as she glances around at the forest on each side of the road. \u201cI spy something... green.\u201d She smiles at me, amused by herself, which makes her at the moment completely and utterly the most wonderful person that\u2019s ever existed, at least in my book.</p><p>\u201cDid you just copy me?\u201d I question with an arch of my brow.</p><p>She exaggeratedly presses her hand to her heart. \u201cNo way. How could I when I don\u2019t even know what the answer was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah... I guess...\u201d I focus on her, pretending like I\u2019m trying to read her thoughts, and it makes her squirm. Maintaining an impartial expression, I give her an answer she\u2019ll never expect. \u201cYour eyes.\u201d</p><p>She points a finger at me, grinning. \u201cMy eyes are blue.\u201d</p><p>Even though my mind is resistant, I raise my hand and touch my fingertips to her temple. \u201cActually, they\u2019re blue with little specks of green in them. It\u2019s one of the first things I noticed about you.\u201d</p><p>She presses her lips together so forcefully the skin around them turns purple. \u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>I nod, my guilt consuming me, and I want to retract everything I\u2019ve ever said to her. But like I know way too well, you can\u2019t just take stuff back. The decisions we make from the moment we definitively make them stick with us forever. Like deciding to take the responsibility of being the driver for the night, which may not seem like a big thing, but in my case, it drastically altered my life forever. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh my hell,\u201d Delilah declares, still massaging Dylan\u2019s neck. \u201cYou two are fucking adorable.\u201d</p><p>The color drains from Nova\u2019s face and she rotates in the seat, looking away from me, and slumping back in the seat. If I didn\u2019t learn about her past, I\u2019d question why she did it, but now that I know, I understand, at least to an extent. I turn around in my seat, crossing my arms over my chest, and the car grows quiet.</p><p>Nova starts fiddling with the bands on her wrist that she wears to cover the scar. I lower my hands to my lap and drum my fingers on my knee, remembering how I felt after Lexi\u2019s funeral, even though I\u2019d never made it there. But the idea that she was gone, buried in the ground, made me feel helpless, and I had the intense need to turn everything off. Was that how Nova felt after her boyfriend died?</p><p>Without even knowing what I\u2019m doing, I slide my hand across the seat and to Nova\u2019s lap. She flinches from the initial contact and I almost expect her to jerk away. But she remains motionless and I wrap my fingers around her wrist, pressing them against the small, bumpy line on her skin, just below the bands. She rests her head back against the seat, her heart rate quickening, before returning to a steady, consistent beat. The feeling of it calms me down, because it reminds me that there\u2019s life in the world, and that hearts do keep beating even after they break.</p> <p>Nova</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you bought me these,\u201d I say, staring in disbelief at the pink drums set up in front of me. Landon and I are in my garage, and the door is shut to lock out the icy air, the snow, and the outside world. It\u2019s my birthday and I came out here with him, thinking he was going to drive me somewhere, but instead, there are wonderful, girly drums.</p><p>\u201cDo you like them?\u201d he asks, his arms crossed over his chest. He looks really worried, like I\u2019m actually going to hate getting pink drums.</p><p>I spread my arms out to the side. \u201cOf course. They\u2019re pink drums.\u201d</p><p>A fleeting smile sneaks through, and for a second the brown in his eyes almost looks golden. \u201cGood, because I was worried you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>I press my hands together, circling around the drums, bouncing with excitement. \u201cWhy? You know I\u2019ve always wanted my own set. It gets so annoying using the school\u2019s, especially because all the guys think it\u2019s a guy\u2019s instrument and that I shouldn\u2019t be playing with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re just jealous.\u201d He drops down in a camping chair by the steps. His hair is damp from walking over to my house during the snowstorm, and his cheeks are a little flushed from the cold. He has a black hooded jacket on with the sleeves rolled up, and there\u2019s a ring of murky water around the bottom of his jeans. \u201cGo ahead, Nova Reed, show me what you got.\u201d</p><p>I sit down in the stool and pick up the sticks. \u201cBut you already know what I\u2019ve got. You\u2019ve heard me play like a thousand times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, for a crowded room.\u201d He relaxes back in the chair. \u201cBut I want you to play just for me.\u201d</p><p>I air-jam for a moment. \u201cWhat do you want me to play?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cWhatever you want. Make it mean something, though.\u201d</p> <p>I hate it when he says that, because he\u2019s the kind of person who\u2019s always looking deeper into things than a normal person, like me. I search my brain for the perfect song, but each one has a flaw, is either too fast or too slow, or I can\u2019t play it as good as I want to just yet. Finally I decide just to play my own song, one that I haven\u2019t been able to get out of my head since the day he first kissed me.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I have one, but you have to promise not to laugh at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I laugh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I made it up,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd it\u2019s probably not very good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it is,\u201d he assures me. \u201cBesides, I would never laugh at you.\u201d He\u2019s no longer joking, and I love him so much for it. I want to tell him right there that I love him, even though I\u2019ve known for a while, but like always, I chicken out.</p><p>Sighing to myself, I elevate the sticks above my head, pretending like I\u2019m going to slam them down and make a lot of noise, but when I touch them to the drums, I hit soft, but with meaning and purpose. I start playing the song, getting more into it the longer I play. At one point I shut my eyes and let my hands lead the way, getting lost in the beat, getting swept away to another world while I think up lyrics in my head and whisper them under my breath. If I didn\u2019t know any better, I\u2019d swear I\u2019d died for a moment and left my body peacefully.</p><p>But then the song ends, and the moment of peace floats away and is replaced by nervousness. I open my eyes and realize that the camping chair is empty. I glance to my left and then my right, panicking when I don\u2019t see him anywhere.</p><p>\u201cWas I that bad?\u201d I wonder aloud, frowning at the sticks in my hand.</p> <p>\u201cNo, it was perfect.\u201d The sound of his voice right over my shoulder causes me to jump.</p><p>I spin around in the chair, dropping the drumsticks, and pressing my hand over my racing heart. \u201cShit, you scared me.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t laugh at me, nor does he smile. He simply studies me with a perplexed, somewhat astonished look. \u201cThat was beautiful,\u201d he conclusively says and traces his fingers across my cheekbone. \u201cHappy birthday, Nova,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>My eyelids flutter shut as his hand travels down my jawline, to my neck, to the collar of my shirt. He tugs it down a little and slips his fingers inside my bra as he lays me back against the drums. My head bumps against the cymbal, but I\u2019m too consumed by his thumb grazing my nipple to care about the ringing in my ears.</p><p>He moves his mouth toward mine. \u201cNova... I...\u201d He struggles to say something and I force my eyelids open, despite my body\u2019s protest. Our gazes lock, and for a second I think he\u2019s going to break up with me because he looks terrified and conflicted and completely torn apart on the inside.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>I swear to God time stops.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d I say with zero hesitation.</p><p>He starts to smile but it quickly fades, and then his lips connect with mine. He kisses me, caresses my body, drinks me in until my head becomes so cloudy I can barely remember my name. It\u2019s the perfect birthday. One I know I\u2019ll remember forever, because the guy I want to be with forever finally said he loves me.</p><p>When I open my eyes, the car has stopped moving, and I\u2019m lying in the backseat with a piece of paper on my forehead. Blinking away the disorientation, I sit up and take the note off my head.</p><p>Dear Sleepyhead,</p><p>Once you wake your lazy ass up, meet us out in the tent area.</p><p>Delilah</p><p>Shaking my head, I ball the note up and stuff it away in my pocket. The car is parked at the outskirts of a dirt field that\u2019s packed with people flocking toward a massive stage set up near the forest line. There are drums and amps and every other musical instrument that my heart secretly desires to play set up on it, along with lights strung along the front. The sun is intoxicatingly warm, and it makes the leather seats below me hot and the backs of my legs sticky. There\u2019s no one else inside the car with me and the doors are locked. There are already so many things wrong with being here, like the sight of the drums up onstage, the fact that I missed counting as the sun came up, and the fact that I\u2019m waking up in the backseat of a car I\u2019ve only rode in once. So much unfamiliarity and my heart is already speeding up, slamming against my chest in unnerving thumps, and I start to take deeper breaths as I veer towards hyperventilation. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s about to happen next, whether I\u2019ll lose control, think of Landon too much, panic and do something irrational.</p><p>There\u2019s only one thing that can maybe get me back on track. I take out my cell phone and open the file, the sight of it slightly settling my heart rate, and gradually my breathing returns to normal. The longer I look at it, the more at peace I become, and again I have the urge to open it, my mind whispering at me that if I do I can see him again. Get an understanding. I don\u2019t, though, and once the five minutes pass I turn off my phone since the battery is half dead.</p><p>Scooting to the edge of the seat, I tuck the phone into my pocket, work the lock up, and climb out of the car. I stretch my legs and then tug the elastic from my hair, combing my fingers through the tangles as I start the hike across the field. The atmosphere is lively and buzzing with excitement, and I start counting my steps as I turn to the side and weave my way around groups of people smoking cigarettes and drinking beers. I have no idea where the tent area is or if there\u2019s even such a thing as a tent area.</p><p>Forty-eight... forty-nine... fifty...</p><p>My head is hurting. The air is spicy and sticky and smells like sweat, cigarettes, and weed. I pause in a small gap in the crowd, turning in a circle, trying to get my bearings.</p><p>Fifty-seven... fifty-eight... fifty-nine...</p><p>My heart throbs, and I place my hand on my forehead, trying to spot something familiar. The atmosphere is already getting to be too much, and I\u2019ve been out of the car for a whole three minutes. This is exactly what I was afraid of. I knew I\u2019d get like this, be overwhelmed by people and the fact that I have no idea what\u2019s about to happen in the next second. My mind starts to race and dash toward thoughts of Landon and me at concerts, listening, singing along, kissing...</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d The sound of Quinton\u2019s voice blankets around me and puts a stop to my mental counting insanity. It\u2019s the most amazing thing I\u2019ve ever experienced, and I want to grab on to it with everything I have in me.</p><p>When his hands graze my hips, my body settles even more and a strange quietness surfaces in me, one that I\u2019ve only been able to get through weed. My hand falls from my head as I turn around and angle my neck to look at him. There are red rings around his eyes, not from being stoned but from exhaustion, and a few strands of his brown hair are sticking out on the side of his head. He has a half-finished beer in his hand, and a pack of cigarettes are poking out of the front pocket of his T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cYou look tired,\u201d I call out over the voices of the people around us.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fucking exhausted,\u201d he admits, leaning in toward my ear. His breath smells like beer. He tucks a strand of my hair behind my ear. \u201cI don\u2019t like car rides... And I can\u2019t sleep when I\u2019m in a car.\u201d</p><p>I put my lips beside his ear, trying not to breathe in his scent, but it\u2019s impossible. \u201cYou should go take a nap or something, then.\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head, he steps back and motions around us. \u201cAnd miss all this fun?\u201d</p><p>I frown at the crowd as I refasten my hair into a secure ponytail, leaving a few strands loose to frame my face. I reach for the cherry ChapStick I carry in my back pocket. \u201cIt\u2019s really noisy,\u201d I comment and move the stick over my lips. He watches me through hooded eyes, but I\u2019m going to blame it on the sun.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a concert, Nova.\u201d His tongue slips out of his mouth to wet his lips, and then he tips his head back and takes a sip of the beer, his neck muscles moving as he swallows. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be full of noise and chaos.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I put the ChapStick back in my pocket and wrap my arms around myself, tucking my elbows in as a group of guys walk. \u201cSo when does the music start? Because I think once it does I\u2019ll be able to handle it better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense. Music is noisier.\u201d He reaches up to scratch his forehead. Watching his fingers move reminds me of how he touched my scar\u2014or my pulse\u2014in the car. I haven\u2019t figured out which one yet, and I\u2019m not sure which is better. Either he was touching the scar that clearly gives away what I did that day on the bathroom floor or he was feeling my pulse, which seems intimate and, even though I hate to admit it, beautiful\u2014because, seriously, who does that? Who feels the heartbeat of another person like it\u2019s important?</p><p>\u201cMusic is settling to me, especially songs that I know,\u201d I tell him, standing on my tiptoes and inclining toward him so I don\u2019t have to yell over the bustle of the crowd. \u201cAnd it\u2019ll settle me down.\u201d Maybe. As long as I can\u2019t connect the song to Landon.</p><p>His forehead creases like he\u2019s deeply contemplating something, but all he says is, \u201cCome on.\u201d Then he swings his arm around my shoulder and draws me close as he winds through the crowd, steering me with him. I wrap my arms around his midsection as smoke snakes around us.</p> <p>\u201cOh and by the way,\u201d he says, turning us to the side to get around two trucks parked closely together. \u201cDylan was superpissed about the purple tent.\u201d He smiles, pleased.</p><p>I smile too, matching my footsteps to his, and somewhere along the way I lose track of how many I\u2019ve taken. I don\u2019t realize it until we reach the tent area, which is basically a bunch of tents set up in random places that have chairs and coolers near them, totally disorganized and a complete nightmare for me. I hold on to him tighter, breathing in his scent as we step out into the sea of tents, suddenly aware of how clear my head is and how much I don\u2019t want to let go of him. I\u2019m not sure what to do with the revelation. Run? Embrace it? Cry?</p><p>I\u2019m still clinging onto Quinton when Delilah and Dylan duck out from their purple two-person dome tent. Another, slightly larger tent stands to the side, and Tristan is working to get the poles in it correctly so it\u2019ll stand up straight.</p><p>The three of them notice us simultaneously. They all look like they want to say a remark about us cuddling together; Delilah\u2019s will probably be sassy, Dylan\u2019s crude\u2014and Tristan, by the look on his face, might snap something ruthless. But somehow, they manage to control themselves. I think about backing away from Quinton, but I can\u2019t seem to get my feet to cooperate.</p><p>\u201cSo who\u2019s up for a little business?\u201d Dylan asks, slipping his plaid jacket off. He balls it up and chucks it into the tent, while Delilah heads over to a red cooler that\u2019s between the two tents.</p> <p>\u201cI thought we were going to keep this strictly fun,\u201d Tristan says, squinting as he threads a pole through the fabric of the tent. \u201cWasn\u2019t that the deal?\u201d</p><p>Delilah returns to Dylan and hands a beer to him. \u201cYeah, you said this was just fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said it could be fun for you.\u201d He pinches her ass and unscrews the lid of the bottle. \u201cI have to work.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not na\u00efve enough not to know what kind of work they\u2019re doing\u2014it\u2019s the same thing I knew they were doing out in the back of the sporting goods store, even though no one said anything to me. It makes me very aware of the environment I\u2019m in, but I don\u2019t seem to care. I used to care about stuff all the time, then I lost the thing I cared about the most, and it seemed like everything left meant nothing or was insignificant.</p><p>My cheek is pressed against Quinton\u2019s chest, and his heart is striking rapidly from inside his chest, like he\u2019s uneasy, too. \u201cI think I\u2019m just going to relax,\u201d he says, moving around the chair and heading toward the cooler with his arm still around me. I shuffle my feet with his. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long fucking drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was four hours,\u201d Tristan grimaces, bowing the pole toward the ground. He\u2019s got his shirt off. His chest glistens with sweat, and his jeans hang low on his hips. \u201cBesides, all your dumb ass had to do was sit in the backseat.\u201d His voice drops to a mutter as he stabs the pole in the ground. \u201cBut then again, we know how great it is to put you behind the wheel.\u201d</p> <p>I feel the volt of panic surge through Quinton\u2019s body, and every single one of his muscles tightens and he quickly jerks his arm away from me. No words are uttered, no looks are exchanged. He just hurries off, his expression blank, and seconds later he vanishes into the crowd.</p><p>I\u2019m left standing there with my jaw hanging to my knees and the impulse to chase after him, wondering where he\u2019s running off to. I should go after him. Not let him go. But once again, I just stand there, not doing anything.</p><p>I turn to Tristan and without a second thought say, \u201cWhy did you say that?\u201d</p><p>Tristan avoids eye contact with me, keeping his head down. \u201cIf you want to know, then go after Quinton. You two seem to be hitting it off so well.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him in disbelief, trying to figure out what the hell is going on. Why would Tristan make a comment like that? Was Quinton in an accident or something?</p><p>Delilah steps up beside me and loops her arm through mine, jerking on my arm and tugging me away from my staredown with Tristan. She has a white tank top on and the bottom is folded up so her stomach is showing. Her shorts are ripped in the front, and her auburn hair is in a messy bun on top of her head. \u201cHow about Nova and I go try and snag some water bottles off someone, since you two jackasses thought it wasn\u2019t necessary to bring any,\u201d she says.</p><p>Dylan sits down on the cooler and crosses his legs out in front of him as he drinks his beer. \u201cThat\u2019s what the beer is for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s what causes dehydration,\u201d Delilah snaps with a shake of her head. \u201cFucking idiots,\u201d she mutters, pulling me with her as she stomps toward the crowd.</p> <p>But I don\u2019t want to go with her. I want to go find Quinton and find out what\u2019s wrong. That\u2019s what I want\u2014need\u2014to do, like I didn\u2019t do multiple times with Landon. My thoughts are racing a million miles a minute as we approach the edge of where the crowd thickens, and I veer toward having a panic attack. Because I can\u2019t see Quinton anywhere. I can\u2019t see anything at the moment, and it\u2019s scaring the shit out of me.</p><p>I slip my arm out of Delilah\u2019s and take off after Quinton. \u201cI\u2019ll catch up with you later,\u201d I call out, waving.</p><p>\u201cHey, where the hell are you going!\u201d The sound of Delilah\u2019s voice hits my back and I sprint off before my mind decides to turn back.</p><p>I push people out of my way as I hurry through the mob, knowing that the probability of finding Quinton is very low. But I have to try, otherwise I might end up regretting it.</p><p>Forever.</p><p>Quinton</p><p>I take off through the crowd, my mind racing a million miles a minute as I\u2019m painfully reminded of who I am and what I did. I need to get away from here\u2014from Nova. From everyone. I don\u2019t deserve any of this. I don\u2019t deserve anything.</p><p>It\u2019s like one moment everything is fine, and then a few honest words are muttered and suddenly I remember who I am. Tristan had every right to say what he said. I killed his sister\u2014it\u2019s my fault that he can\u2019t see her anymore. It all my fault. But it pisses me off a little that he said it only because I had my arm around Nova. He has a thing for her, and I know I should take a step back and let him have her\u2014she\u2019d be better off with him. Kind of, anyway. Honestly she\u2019d be better off with the old version of me, the one who was going to go to college, open his own art studio, and paint and take pictures, and start a family eventually. It was a boring plan, but it was what I wanted, but everything got erased that day and now I\u2019m here, roaming around in the world without any direction, waiting for it to come to an end again.</p><p>I wander around the crowd for what seems like an eternity, engrossed in my thoughts, on the verge of crying as the past stabs at my insides and makes me feel like I\u2019m bleeding out, just like I did on the side of the road after the accident. If it\u2019d gone on just a little bit longer, if the ambulance would have driven just a little bit slower, then maybe they wouldn\u2019t have been able to revive me. Then I wouldn\u2019t have to be here in this world, living a fucking life I don\u2019t want. I\u2019d made peace that night as I lay beside Lexi, but then my peace was taken away from me when they brought me back to life. And now I\u2019m left with the guilt of their the deaths rotting away at the side of me, like I\u2019m buried in the ground with them, but I\u2019m not. Maybe that\u2019s what I deserve, though.</p><p>As tears start to spill out, I take a deep drag of the cigarette that has a flake of weed shoved into the tip, trying to stop crying. It\u2019s a discreet way to smoke in front of people, although I\u2019m pretty sure that no one around here gives a shit who\u2019s smoking what. Then I run into Delilah and Dylan, and Delilah proceeds to chew me out, saying that I need to be careful around Nova, because she\u2019s breakable.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hurt her,\u201d she says, jabbing a finger into my chest so hard it hurts. \u201cI mean it. She\u2019s been through a lot, you know. I mean her boyfriend killed himself, for Christ\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes are bulging, and I\u2019m fairly certain she might be spun out of her mind. I haven\u2019t seen it actually go on with her, but there have been a few times where I\u2019ve noticed Dylan up about as high as someone can go and then suddenly he\u2019s at the bottom, furious at the world. I actually knew a guy once that did meth a lot, and that was pretty much how he was all the time. But he also lived in a shed out in the backyard of his parents home and he had no job and no teeth, and he liked to talk about conspiracies a lot. I don\u2019t get why a girl like Delilah would do it. She\u2019s beautiful and seems mildly intelligent. What\u2019s she hiding from? Or is it just Dylan\u2019s influence?</p><p>But I don\u2019t ask and tell her what she needs to hear. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of her. I promise.\u201d Promise. Promise. Promise me. Tears form in my eyes again. I\u2019m making promises about Nova and breaking my promise to Lexi, and half of me wants to break that promise.</p><p>Dylan gives me a hug, because he\u2019s spun out of his mind and probably has no idea what he\u2019s doing or where he even is, and I refrain from the urge to punch him in the face. Then they leave me, holding hands, and talking about a million miles a minute. And I stand there in the middle of the crowd, with my thoughts and my guilt, surrounded by people, but somehow feeling utterly alone.</p><p>Nova</p><p>I can\u2019t find him anywhere and it\u2019s pushing me toward a panic attack. I keep thinking about how upset he looked when he took off\u2014how upset he always looked. I keep running and running deeper into the crowd, even when a voice flows through the speakers and is echoed by a strum of guitars. Then the opening band begins playing, and music and sweat and enthusiasm deluge the field, along with the enthralling scent of smoke. I stop in the middle with my hand on my head, trying to hold on to reality and figure a way out, searching the ground and the sky for something to count, but I can\u2019t find anything. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHold on to my hand,\u201d Landon shouts over the music as he holds his hand out to me. But I hesitate, looking around at the people tripping out of their minds, high on music. \u201cNova.\u201d His voice brings me back to him. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let anything happen to you.\u201d</p><p>I place my fingers in his and he pulls on my arm, steering me in front of him, so he can walk behind me with his hands protectively on my hips. The band that\u2019s playing is usually a rough, edgy band, but their playing one of their softer, sultrier songs.</p><p>We\u2019re in a dome building, but as I stand in the crowd, listening to their lyrics and watching them pour their hearts out onstage, I can\u2019t help but wish that we were outside, underneath the sparkling stars, because it would add to the magical feeling building in me.</p><p>\u201cAre you enjoying yourself?\u201d Landon whispers in my ear, his breath damp against my skin.</p> <p>I nod, then realizing I\u2019ve shut my eyes, I open them. \u201cI am,\u201d I say, tilting my head back so I can look in his eyes. \u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>He nods with a hint of a smile on his lips. \u201cI am. You\u2019re like the only person I do have fun around while I\u2019m sober.\u201d He says it as a joke, but the haunting hollowness in his eyes makes me wonder if he\u2019s lying.</p><p>I turn around and loop my arms around his neck. \u201cWhy? What\u2019s so special about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still trying to figure that out,\u201d he says with his hand against the small of my back and his forehead wrinkled.</p><p>It makes me feel small and ugly and unimportant to him. I let out a breath, moving my arms away, because I\u2019m about to cry. But he presses me closer, shaking his head.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t mean it like that, Nova,\u201d he insists. \u201cIn fact, that came out very wrong.\u201d</p><p>I force down the strangling lump in my throat. \u201cThen what did you mean?\u201d</p><p>Looking down at me, he strokes my cheekbone with his fingers. \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d He stares into my eyes, like he\u2019s trying to read his own thoughts through his reflection in my pupils. Then he grabs my arm, twirls me around, and tugs me back against him, wrapping his arms around my waist. \u201cLet\u2019s just enjoy ourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay...\u201d My voice gets lost in the music as he kisses my neck, sucking on the skin, even biting at it. \u201cI love you Nova... I always will... no matter what.\u201d</p><p>I blink from the thought as a stray elbow rams me in the side. I\u2019m being smashed into as people demand more room, flailing their arms and bobbing their heads. And everywhere I look I see Landon\u2019s honey-brown eyes and inky-black hair, only sometimes the hair shifts to short and brown and suddenly Quinton is everywhere, a sea of replicates that need to be helped. And then I see the one image I loathe more than anything.</p><p>The rope is slightly frayed, like it was about to break, and all I could think as I fell to the floor was: Why couldn\u2019t it just break?</p> <p>\u201cGod damn it.\u201d I clutch at my head and my knees buckle as I collapse to the ground, knowing that there\u2019s a good chance that I\u2019m going to get trampled, especially if I\u2019m near the mosh pit.</p><p>But I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m too lost in Landon. He would always say that, that he\u2019d love me no matter what. At the time, I thought it was just something he said, but now I wonder if he was always saying it because he wanted me to know he loved me, even if he took his own life. The thought of this brings me no sense of relief, because that would mean that pretty much the entire time we dated, he was thinking about leaving me. Then he did, and now he\u2019s gone, and I\u2019m left sitting in the dirt at a concert that I really don\u2019t want to be at. My hands are getting stomped on and I\u2019m getting kicked, but I can\u2019t get up. I\u2019m starting to have a panic attack, which has happened a few times. My therapist always told me to breathe through it and that it would pass, but how the hell can I when my lungs are shriveling up and oxygen is getting restricted?</p><p>\u201cNova, what the fuck?\u201d A voice rises over the shouting and music. A hand grabs my shoulder and someone lifts me from the ground.</p><p>It\u2019s not the voice I want to hear, neither Landon\u2019s nor Quinton\u2019s. Instead, Tristan stands in front of me, holding my arm, and he looks pissed off for some reason.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d He grips my elbow and hauls me to the right, thrusting his hand out in front of him to create a narrow walking path for us. \u201cYou can\u2019t just sit down in the middle of this shit.\u201d</p><p>I trip over my own feet as I aimlessly let him lead me through the people. Ultimately we break free from the chaos and step out into the mellower tent area. My head empties a little, but not a lot. In fact, the noise and loudness that\u2019s diminished around me is replaced by noise and loudness screaming inside my head. You didn\u2019t find him... didn\u2019t help him. \u201cWhy did you say that to him?\u201d I wiggle my arm out of Tristan\u2019s grasp as we reach our tents. \u201cThat thing about being the driver?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause...\u201d He drags his hands through his hair, smoothing it out of his eyes, and he leaves his hand on the top of his head, his elbow bent out to the side. \u201cLook, I fucked up, okay? I shouldn\u2019t have said it. It doesn\u2019t bring anyone back.\u201d He turns around, clutching the back of his neck, and hikes over to the tent.</p><p>I know very little about Tristan, other than he\u2019s my age, he does drugs, but he\u2019s actually really smart. Even though he failed most of his classes, he always did well on tests, but he just never turned in his homework. I don\u2019t know what his likes and dislikes are, or what he does besides smoke a lot of weed and drink. I\u2019ve never met his parents. I don\u2019t know if he has any sisters or brothers. But he\u2019s always seemed like a nice guy, and so it doesn\u2019t make sense to me that he would intentionally say something to Quinton that would hurt him.</p> <p>He ducks in the tent and zips up the door. Seconds later, smoke seeps out of the screens on the side. I trudge over to the cooler, open the lid, and take out a beer. I pluck the fragments of ice off the glass, wipe the condensation on the side of my shorts, then sit down on the cooler and drink the beer while I survey the crowd from a safe distance. Delilah and Dylan\u2019s tent occasionally shakes, and I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re having sex inside it.</p><p>How did I get here? To this place? This moment? This life?</p><p>I sit on the cooler for a while, drinking the beer, watching the stage, listening to the rhythm and the musical poetry flowing from the stage. The more alcohol that enters my system, the more calm I feel. The sky dims, and Delilah and Dylan come out and wander off somewhere while Tristan stays in the tent. I\u2019m guzzling beer when Quinton emerges from the crowd. He\u2019s got a cigarette in his hand, his brown hair is wet, along with the top of his shirt, and it looks like he\u2019s been crying.</p><p>I lower the bottle from my lips and wipe my mouth with the back of my hand. \u201cWhy is your shirt wet?\u201d</p><p>He points over his shoulder without making eye contact with me. \u201cSome asshole dumped a bucket of water on me when I walked by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I ask, not really referring to the water.</p><p>He shrugs, reaching behind his head, and tugging off his shirt. \u201cIt\u2019s just a little water.\u201d He tosses the shirt toward the tent and then motions for me to stand up.</p><p>I obey, getting to my feet as I take in the lines of muscles carving his chest and stomach, along with the coarse-looking scar running vertically down the middle, right over his heart. He opens the lid to the cooler and grabs a beer, the muscles of his arms flexing with his movements, and the names tattooed on his arm ripple. Ryder and Lexi. There\u2019s also the phrase no one below the names. Who are Ryder and Lexi? Why do they mean so much to him that he\u2019d permanently tattoo a reminder of them of them on his body? And who\u2019s no one?</p><p>When he stands up straight with a beer in his hand, he notices my gaze. I start to ask him what they mean, but he covers the tattoos with his hand, and the harsh look in his eyes makes me snap my mouth shut. He unscrews the cap off the beer, and then he lets his head fall back as he nearly guzzles half of it in one large gulp. Lowering the bottle from his mouth, he licks the remaining alcohol off his lips.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Tristan?\u201d he asks, staring at the stage.</p><p>\u201cIn the tent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoing what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Smoking weed, I think.\u201d</p><p>He twists his head in my direction with his eyebrow crooked. \u201cHow would you know that?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI smelled and saw the smoke coming from the tent.\u201d</p><p>He pops the end of his cigarette into his mouth and gradually inhales. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re probably right.\u201d He holds the breath in for longer than seems necessary, and his lips part as a stream of smoke rises out of his mouth and surrounds his face.</p><p>I\u2019m confused because it smells like weed, but he\u2019s smoking a cigarette. His eyes look glassy, though, and his pupils are immense. He continues to drag on the cigarette, looking more and more out of it with each breath. Finally he grabs one of the fold-up chairs in front of the tent and sits on it. I\u2019m trying to figure out what the hell to do or say to him when Tristan exits the tent, his shirt still off and his blond hair disheveled.</p><p>I stand there awkwardly as the two of them pretend that the other one isn\u2019t there. Tristan goes over to the cooler and takes out a beer, and then he stares at the ground in front of his feet while he rotates the bottle around in his hand.</p><p>\u201cSorry, man,\u201d he mutters, freeing a breath from his chest. \u201cI really didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Quinton replies without looking at him. \u201cI deserved it\u2014deserve more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it was your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t. Shit just happens and I was just being a douche bag because... of stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I deserved it.\u201d</p><p>Tristan drags a chair next to Quinton\u2019s and sits down. \u201cHow about we agree to disagree?\u201d He tilts the top of his beer bottle in Quinton\u2019s direction.</p><p>Quinton sighs and taps his bottle against Tristan\u2019s. \u201cYou should really start acting more like your parents toward me. And my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy parents are fucking idiots,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd your dad\u2019s always been a dick, even before.\u201d</p><p>Quinton doesn\u2019t respond, and silence sets in as he hands Tristan his cigarette. I stand just behind them, gripping my beer bottle, wondering if I should leave because they seem to be having a little bonding moment. I feel awkward, because I have no idea what\u2019s going on and the moment seems so personal.</p><p>\u201cNova, are you alive back there?\u201d Tristan asks without looking at me.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I reply and then finish off the rest of my beer before tossing it in the trash bag just outside the tent.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to sit down?\u201d Tristan glances over his shoulder at me. It\u2019s getting dark and his blue eyes look like sapphires. \u201cOr do you prefer sitting in the dirt in the middle of the crowd?\u201d The corners of his mouth tug upward, and it\u2019s like nothing even happened, as if there had been no fight between the two of them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My eyes drift around our little area. \u201cI\u2019m fine. There are no chairs anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy were you sitting in the dirt?\u201d Quinton glances at me for first time since he returned, and I have this crazy impulse to hug him and say I\u2019m sorry for not being able to find him, but I don\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI went looking for you,\u201d I say with a shrug. \u201cAnd then everyone went crazy when the band started to play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you just sat down?\u201d he asks, gaping at me unfathomably. \u201cIn the middle of a fucking concert?\u201d</p> <p>I shrug again. \u201cJust another thing to make me amusing, I guess.\u201d</p><p>The two of them gape at me and then they bust up laughing. I feel kind of stupid and all the problems and worries I\u2019d been having shift to the fact that they think I\u2019m insane. I debate whether to pretend I have to go to the bathroom or just dive into the tent.</p><p>Their laughter dies down and Quinton wipes a tear from his eye as he beckons to me. \u201cCome here,\u201d he says.</p><p>I briefly dither and shuffle over to him. \u201cI told you concerts are too noisy. It\u2019s messing with my head.\u201d</p><p>He sets his empty beer bottle into the cup holder on the arm of the chair and stretches his arm out to the side, keeping the smoke as far away from me as possible. \u201cDid you really go looking for me?\u201d</p> <p>I nod. \u201cYeah, you looked sad.\u201d</p><p>I can feel Tristan\u2019s eyes on me, even though it looks like he\u2019s staring at the crowd.</p><p>Quinton scans my face and then reaches up and spreads his fingers around my hips. Pulling me down, he sits me on his lap, then he sweeps my hair to the side, and places his lips next to my ear. His breath is hot against my skin and smells pungently of weed. \u201cI\u2019m really okay. You don\u2019t need to worry about me.\u201d He moves away and releases my hips from his grip.</p><p>I\u2019m uncertain if he wants me to stay on his lap or get up, or if I want to stay put or run like hell. \u201cYeah, I do,\u201d I say, and we trade a look that neither of us really understand. All I know is that something is changing inside me. I don\u2019t know what it is or if it\u2019s good or bad, because it\u2019s unknown and unplanned and surprising and new. I\u2019m terrified, because it feels like I\u2019m tumbling off a cliff and I have no idea when I\u2019m going to hit the bottom. Or if I ever will.</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>Quinton</p> <p>She\u2019s sitting on my lap and she shouldn\u2019t be. For many different reasons, one being that Tristan is sitting right next to us. But he\u2019s pretty stoned and doesn\u2019t seem to care. He even says something to a few girls that wander by with their tops off, smiling when one of them blows a kiss at him. Still, I don\u2019t deserve any of this. Nova. Tristan\u2019s forgiveness and understanding. What I deserve is to be fucking dead instead of Ryder and Lexi.</p><p>But Nova said she went looking for me. No one ever goes looking for me or cared enough to worry about me. When she says it, I\u2019m pretty certain my worthless heart shatters inside my chest, and she steals one of the pieces. If it didn\u2019t already belong to someone else I probably would have handed her all the pieces right then and there.</p><p>She sits on my lap for an eternity, chatting about music, while Tristan and I take turns passing the cigarette back and forth. She seems happier than she did a little while ago, and it makes me happy watching her eyes light up as she talks about lyrics and her favorite bands, always putting an emphasis on the s.</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d she disagrees with something Tristan has said, and he grins because he has her attention. \u201cThey\u2019re not better, and their drummer totally sucks.\u201d</p><p>Leaning over, Tristan grabs the handle of the cooler and hauls it over. He puts it in front of his chair and uses it for a footrest. \u201cWhat makes you the expert?\u201d he asks Nova.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m a drummer and therefore I know these things.\u201d Nova shoves his feet off the cooler and, bending forward, she lifts the cooler lid. Her shorts slip down a little as she digs a beer out of the ice, and I have to fight back a smile because her panties are black and lacy. Honestly, I would have pinpointed her as a white-cotton kind of girl, considering how embarrassed she got when she made a joke about popping her outdoor-concert cherry.</p><p>\u201cJust because you can play the drums\u201d\u2014Tristan grazes his thumb across the bottom of the cigarette, scattering ashes onto the ground \u201c\u2014doesn\u2019t mean you can decide who plays the drums better and who sucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it does.\u201d Nova\u2019s getting sassier with the more beers she drinks. She extends her arm out toward the cigarette, like she\u2019s going to grab it and take a hit.</p> <p>This time I choose to do things differently and put a moment of good in the world, despite the fact that I have to be a hypocrite to do it. I swat her hand out of the way and shake my head. \u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she protests with a frown. \u201cWhat the hell was that for?\u201d</p><p>I shift my arm so my hand falls down into my lap, just beside her hip. \u201cSo do I ever get to see you play?\u201d I dodge around the subject to keep her mind diverted from getting high.</p><p>\u201cThe drums?\u201d she asks, still frowning, and when I nod, she seems reluctant to answer. She tips her head back and places the mouth of the bottle to her lips, sipping out the beer. Her hair falls down her back and softly brushes my arm, and it sends a silent quiver through my body. She lowers the bottle and licks her lips. \u201cI don\u2019t know...\u201d She inquiringly looks me in the eye. \u201cDo you want to watch me play?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I say, reminding myself that we\u2019re just friends. Just friends. \u201cThat\u2019s why I asked.\u201d</p><p>She wets her lips with her tongue, deliberately this time, and I wonder if she\u2019s doing it on purpose so I\u2019ll focus on her lips. \u201cWhen we get back to town... if you want... you can come over and watch me play.\u201d Her voice shakes as she says it, like the words are thick in her throat and she\u2019s struggling to enunciate each letter.</p><p>\u201cHey, what about me?\u201d Tristan asks, offended, as he flicks the cigarette onto the ground and stomps on it with his bare feet. Then he starts cursing as his skin begins to burn. \u201cShit, that\u2019s hot.\u201d</p><p>She ignores him, her eyes fastened on me as she takes a faltering breath, balling her hands into fists. \u201cBut I get to pick which song.\u201d</p><p>I nod, nervous about how personal this is getting. \u201cOkay, sounds like a plan, Nova Reed.\u201d</p><p>Tristan huffs a frustrated breath, then takes his cell phone out of his pocket and starts texting.</p><p>Nova rotates around so her back\u2019s to me and she\u2019s facing the stage. She relaxes against my chest with her legs hanging over my knees. I tense, but she doesn\u2019t seem to notice. In fact, I think she\u2019s extremely comfortable, and the more she stays there, the more comfortable I get.</p><p>\u201cMy dad taught me to play,\u201d she says and downs another mouthful of beer. \u201cWhen I was six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe taught you to play the drums?\u201d I keep my tone light, remembering how when I first met her she told me her dad died.</p><p>She nods, spinning the bottle around in between the palms of her hands. \u201cHe also played the guitar, but for some reason I could never figure out that instrument.\u201d</p><p>She sounds like she\u2019s choking up, and I want to console her. I open and close my hands, then place my palms on the tops of her thighs, so she\u2019s trapped between my arms. Her leg muscles spasm underneath my touch, but she doesn\u2019t move away.</p><p>\u201cHow old were you when he died?\u201d I ask, kneading her soft skin with my fingertips. What the fuck am I doing?</p><p>\u201cTwelve.\u201d Her breath hitches in her throat. From the stage, the singer shouts out something about every girl taking their top off. She clears her throat multiple times. \u201cCan I ask you a question?\u201d</p><p>Even though I\u2019m certain I\u2019m not going to like her question, considering the topic we\u2019re on, I nod. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>She wavers, staring up at the stars across the ash-black sky. \u201cHave you ever lost someone close to you?\u201d</p><p>I hear Tristan cough several times beside me and then he turns to the side in his chair, like he wants to escape this conversation. The band starts playing again, hammering on the drums and shouting in the microphone, and Nova starts thrumming her fingers on top of her legs to the rhythm.</p><p>It takes me a while to respond. \u201cYeah, I have.\u201d</p><p>She nods and doesn\u2019t say anything more. Most people would have asked me who and how. I remember right after the accident everyone wanted to know what happened, not just to Lexi and Ryder but to me, too. I was in the hospital for quite a while. Miraculously the guy I hardly knew that was kissing Ryder in the backseat barely had any bruises and scrapes, and the driver of the other car broke her leg. That was it. Two with minor injuries and three deaths, if I include myself, which I do. Even though I was revived that day, I still think of myself as dead.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Nova turns her head to look at me. \u201cYou seem tense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I assure her.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d She looks doubtful as she searches my eyes.</p><p>It\u2019s been a while since someone has been so concerned about me. Not even Lexi worried about me this much, even when I\u2019d get low about my dad\u2019s distant parenting tactics.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d I tell Nova. \u201cNow stop worrying about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she says, working to smile, like she doesn\u2019t believe me. She coils a strand of her brown hair around her finger. \u201cDo you think that somewhere in the world, at this very moment, someone is doing this exact same thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Sitting around and getting high?\u201d Tristan jokes, glancing up from his cell phone screen.</p><p>\u201cNo, sitting under the stars, listening to music.\u201d She unwinds her hair around her finger.</p><p>Tristan shrugs, sliding his finger across the screen of the phone as he gets to his feet. \u201cYou\u2019re a very strange girl,\u201d he says and heads for the tent, then at the last second veers off in the direction the topless girls went.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just curious,\u201d she mutters to herself. \u201cAbout what other people do with their time... with their lives.\u201d</p><p>I sit there for a while, drinking in her words. Somewhere between the weed, watching her lips move, and her strange yet insightful words, I get caught up in it all\u2014in her\u2014and suddenly I\u2019m pressing my lips against hers. I\u2019ve done this a lot before, as a way to distract myself from my life. But this isn\u2019t the same. This means something, but I\u2019m still trying to figure out what and if I want it or even deserve to get it.</p><p>At first she stiffens, but then she hooks her arms around the back of my neck and inches closer, opening her mouth to me as she spreads her legs open, and my hands travel higher toward the bottom of her shorts. She tastes like beer and smells like pot. Tristan\u2019s gone, but he could come back at any moment. I should stop this. I should care enough to stop Tristan from seeing this, but my will to care about doing the right thing at this moment has died. My thoughts are blurred by the lingering high and the scent and feel of Nova. All I seem to care about is caressing her tongue with mine and feeling her skin because it\u2019s soft and soothing, and in another life I\u2019d touch it all the time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m about to pull away, because emotions are prickling inside me, when she swings her leg over me so she\u2019s straddling my lap, then she grips the sides of my neck and pulls me closer. She kisses me fiercely, to the point where it feels like my lips are going to bruise, then she\u2019s crushing her chest against mine as she gently rocks her hips. I dig my fingers into her waist, bringing her even closer, before I push her back, breaking the connection.</p><p>She\u2019s panting, wild-eyed, her hair falling out of the braid. She glances at Tristan\u2019s empty chair and then looks back at me.</p><p>\u201cWe should stop,\u201d I say, but it sounds like a lame attempt, my voice drifting off at the end.</p><p>\u201cW-why?\u201d She stutters a protest and I have to admit that it\u2019s nice there are no tears in her eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p> <p>I brush her hair back from her eyes, and let my fingers linger on the bruise on her cheek. \u201cYou don\u2019t even know me, Nova. I\u2019m no good for you... you deserve so much better.\u201d Please run away. Because I can\u2019t seem to do it myself.</p><p>Her jaw tenses, like I struck a nerve. \u201cI think I should get to decide that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhether I\u2019m good enough for you?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cYeah, which I can only decide if I get to know you,\u201d she says.</p><p>I motion my hand in front of myself, pressing the point. \u201cThis is pretty much it. What you see is what you get.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s never the case,\u201d she disagrees, flattening her palms onto my bare chest right over the scar and my body goes rigid. \u201cIn fact, most of the time people hide who they really are.\u201d Her throat bobs up and down as she swallows hard. \u201cMost of the time you think you know someone, but you really have no clue.\u201d</p><p>I think about her boyfriend and how he took his own life, and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine what that did to her. I wrap my fingers around her scarred wrist, still concealed by bands, and graze my palm along it as the truth pours out of me. \u201cBut sometimes people are exactly who they are. And what you see is what you get.\u201d I press my fingertips down, feeling the beat of her erratic pulse. \u201cI\u2019m exactly who I am. I have no job, I get high and drunk all the time, I have no purpose. Even my fucking art doesn\u2019t have any meaning anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it did once.\u201d She glides her free hand over my shoulder and grips my shoulder blade, her skin searing hot against mine. \u201cAnd all those things are what you do, not who you are.\u201d Her hand is trembling, and her pulse throbs with the beat of the bass coming from the stage. \u201cPlease, let me get to know you, Quinton.\u201d Begging laces her voice and her big blue-green eyes, and I wonder if this is about me anymore, or someone else, and I should get up and walk away because she\u2019s too good for me to be kissing, but she\u2019s so also sad and the little tiny piece of my old self\u2014the one who loved to help everyone\u2014wants to make her happy, make her smile, make her laugh\u2014help her. Even if it\u2019s completely unrealistic.</p><p>Then she\u2019s kissing me again and lightly tugging on my shoulder and I still have my fingers on her pulse and my hand is gripping at her waist. Passion and heat consume our bodies as she traces her finger up the back of my neck. I gently pull on her wrist, drawing her even closer, until there\u2019s no more room left between our bodies, then I slip my hand around to her back and underneath her shirt so I can feel the heat exuding from her skin.</p><p>She lets out a gasp as I move my mouth back, gently biting at her bottom lip. Then I descend lower, down to her jawline, sucking soft kisses on her neck, and she arches it back. When I approach the top of her chest, I can tell she gets nervous by the acceleration in her pulse. She moans as I start to slip the straps of her shirt down, and the sound nearly drives me crazy, my body responding in ways it hasn\u2019t in a long time, as my mouth reaches the curve of her breast. I picture myself standing up, taking her to the tent, and peeling her clothes off, knowing that if I slipped inside her it would feel different than it did with the other women I\u2019ve been with over the last year. I\u2019m trying to decide if I want it\u2014the connection\u2014when someone in the crowd shouts something profane at us and it\u2019s followed by whistling, and the moment scorches into ash and separates into pieces.</p><p>We break away from each other, and I\u2019m relieved to find that she\u2019s not crying this time around and neither am I. But this time is different, and maybe it\u2019s because it\u2019s not the first kiss. Or maybe it\u2019s because I understand her a little bit better, and that she\u2019s not just some girl that giggles and laughs and doesn\u2019t get what it means to hurt inside. She\u2019s been through stuff, and for some reason, I\u2019m drawn to her. Why she\u2019s not crying, though, is a mystery.</p> <p>Her lips are a little bit swollen and her chest is heaving. \u201cMaybe we shouldn\u2019t be doing this out in the open,\u201d she breathes, tracing circles on the back of my neck, as she eyes the tents behind us.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to try and get close to the front?\u201d I ask, trying to avoid going into the tent with her, because I know what will happen if I do. \u201cI think that band you said you love is about ready to start playing.\u201d</p><p>She cranes her neck and looks over her shoulder at the stage with uncertainty in her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s worth it.\u201d</p><p>The people surrounding the stage are rowdy, and a lot of girls have given into the singer\u2019s demands and are walking around topless. It\u2019s a really bad scene, and a year and a half ago I\u2019d never have dreamed of coming to a place like this. But sometimes stuff happens and we find ourselves lost, and suddenly we\u2019re standing in a place we don\u2019t recognize and can\u2019t remember walking\u2014or falling\u2014there, and we\u2019re unsure how to get back or if we even want to.</p><p>I place a hand on her cheek and she quickly looks back at me, holding my gaze. \u201cI won\u2019t let anything happen to you. I promise.\u201d I promise. I promise. I\u2019m so sorry, Lexi.</p><p>She nods, like she completely trusts me. I stand up, clutching the backs of her thighs. She starts to climb off me, but I delve my fingers into her bare skin and lift her back up. She gasps in shock as I press her up against me and firmly hold on to her legs.</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t panic and sit down in the dirt,\u201d I say and hike into the crowd, carrying her with me.</p><p>At first she seems reluctant, but then she locks her ankles behind my back and clings to my shoulders. She angles her face forward and brushes her nose against mine, closing her eyes. \u201cYou remind me of someone I used to know,\u201d she whispers, as I maneuver my way through the crowd toward the stage.</p> <p>\u201cOh yeah.\u201d I turn us to the side and squeeze through two guys with their topless girlfriends on their shoulders, which seems to be a growing theme at this concert. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flutter open and the light from the stage reflects in them. \u201cJust someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCare to share who that someone is?\u201d I trip over my untied shoelaces but quickly recover my balance. The air smells rank, like stale beer, salt, smoke, and pretty much every other foul scent.</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you will someday?\u201d Is there ever going to be a someday with us?</p><p>\u201cMaybe... one day... when I can.\u201d</p><p>We remain quiet during the rest of our journey toward the stage. It\u2019s dark, the stars are shimmering, and the vibrant stage lights illuminate the faces in the crowd. The air is still hot, but there\u2019s a gentle breeze, and goose bumps start to dot Nova\u2019s arms.</p><p>I get us as close as I can, then set her on the ground. She faces the stage, wrapping her arms around herself, and I keep my hands at my sides. Then the band comes out on stage and starts playing a song that\u2019s depressing and genuinely honest in a way that gets under my skin. It talks about life and death and how we\u2019re all connected to both. That even after someone\u2019s gone, life moves on, no matter what we do.</p><p>Halfway through it, Nova shuts her eyes and starts swaying her hips to the beat, her lips matching the singer\u2019s. \u201cI love this song,\u201d she says with her eyes shut and her hands are on the back of her neck.</p><p>My eyes trace the curves of her body and the enthralling way she moves. \u201cI love watching you,\u201d I whisper so softly I know she can\u2019t hear. I dig my fingertips into my palms, trying to resist the compulsion to place my hands on her hips and move with her.</p><p>As the song keeps playing, though, I become more and more hypnotized by her, and the way she lets herself go, when usually she\u2019s so contained. For the briefest second I\u2019m glad I\u2019m there with her, which makes me feel confused and guilty, because I should want to be with Lexi. Thoughts are drifting through my head, in long sequences that don\u2019t match, yet they do when they\u2019re put together in a different order, and suddenly, for a fleeting, guilty, irreversible moment, I\u2019m glad my heart decided to beat again.</p><p>I step forward, not sure what\u2019s driving me, but I give in to it regardless. I wrap my arms around her and pull her nearer, closing my eyes as the sound of her voice caresses my ears. She leans back against me, and we sway together as the music encases us. I wish I could keep my eyes shut forever, because then I\u2019d never have to go back to reality. I don\u2019t try to kiss her or feel her up. I just hold her and let our bodies stay linked, wanting to know her and understand her more than I have with anyone since Lexi. For an instant, I have something to hold on to again, a reason to keep breathing, to live.</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>Nova</p><p>Somehow the night gets abruptly lighter as I lose track of time and direction and the need to count everything that exists around me. I\u2019m not sure how it happens. Maybe it\u2019s because we\u2019re both a little buzzed and the substances are making us act like two completely different people at the moment and later it will catch up with us. Or maybe it\u2019s the simple fact that we\u2019re getting caught up in the music and each other, and the fact that the night feels unreal, like it belongs in the pages of a book where everyone gets their magical night without having to face consequences later.</p><p>After we dance and sing for hours, sweat drips from our bodies, and my arms and legs get tired, Quinton guides me back through the crowd, his fingers entangled with mine. I keep getting bumped into by people as one of the more energetic bands violently play their instruments onstage and everyone starts to go crazy, screaming, shouting, and thrashing their heads around. Finally, Quinton steers me in front of him and then spans his arms out to the side, creating a wider route, bumping anyone who gets in his way. It makes a lot people angry, and by the time we reach the tent area we\u2019ve been yelled at a lot. I find it funny for some reason and so does he, and by the time we stumble into the tent, we\u2019re laughing our asses off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t get punched,\u201d I say, collapsing onto the sleeping bags as he zips up the tent. Tristan\u2019s not here, and I haven\u2019t seen him since Quinton kissed me on the camping chair. I don\u2019t really wonder where he ran off to, though, because I can barely focus on where I\u2019m headed to. Where am I going? What am I doing? Do I want this?</p><p>Quinton turns around, stooped over to avoid hitting his head on the tent\u2019s low ceiling. He still has his shirt off, and a trickle of moonlight shines through the thin fabric of the tent, highlighting his scar and making his eyes look like charcoal. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m deciding how I feel about this moment, whether it scares me or what, when he gets down on his hands and knees and starts to crawl over to me. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful.\u201d He says it so simply, like it\u2019s a fact that he needs to say. He stations his body over mine, and then propping up on his elbows he outlines the brim of my nose with his finger. \u201cYou have these freckles... I\u2019m actually pretty mesmerized by them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy my freckles?\u201d I ask, because it\u2019s the first time anyone\u2019s ever said anything about them.</p><p>He nods, pressing his lips together as he studies me through the dark. \u201cI... I think about drawing them all the time.\u201d</p><p>My hands are at my sides and my hair fell out of the braid a long time ago and it\u2019s a tangled mess around my head. I\u2019m not sure if I can let him draw me, whether I can pass over that moment to him. Just thinking about it is frightening, especially since I told him I\u2019d play the drums for him, and I think I actually meant it.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re lips are soft, too.\u201d He grazes the pad of his thumb along my bottom lip, sighing, and then he moves his hand up to my hair and tangles his fingers through it, tugging at the roots a little. It feels so good, and my eyelids start to grow heavy. \u201cWe should try to get some sleep,\u201d he whispers, and I nod, knowing if I don\u2019t go to sleep soon, pulling away from him is going to be harder.</p><p>He shifts his body off me and I pivot to my side, flopping my arm out and feeling around for my sleeping bag, ready to pass out.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d he mutters, lifting the sleeping bag off the ground, and peering beneath it. \u201cI think Tristan left one of the sleeping bags in the trunk. I\u2019ll go get it.\u201d</p><p>I flip back over and grasp onto his arm, his muscles constricting underneath my fingers. The music is still booming outside, and there are a lot of people shouting near the tent. \u201cWait, don\u2019t leave me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNova, I\u2019ll be right back,\u201d he promises. \u201cOr you can come with me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m too tired.\u201d I yawn, covering my mouth with my free hand. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to be left here... what if something bad happens?\u201d</p><p>I must have pushed the right button because he gives in easily after that, settling back down on the floor on his side.</p><p>\u201cYou can use my sleeping bag,\u201d he says, reaching for a pillow. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll use Tristan\u2019s until he comes back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll move to the floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t you get cold?\u201d</p> <p>He suppresses his laughter as he fluffs the pillow and tucks it underneath his head. \u201cNova, it\u2019s like seventy degrees in here. I\u2019m pretty much sweating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the floor\u2019s hard.\u201d I rotate to my side onto the sleeping bag and Styrofoam padding. \u201cYou can just... you can just share with me.\u201d</p><p>It takes him a second to respond. \u201cAre you okay with that?\u201d</p><p>I nod and then realize it\u2019s too dark for him to see it. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m perfectly fine.\u201d My voice is unsteady though, replicating my nerves. I flip the sleeping bag open and climb in it, wiggling back until I\u2019m at the edge, almost ready to fall out the other side.</p><p>He remains motionless, looking like a statue in the dark. A perfect statue, one carved of marble but that has small nicks and chips in it, and I want to figure out what put them there. I can\u2019t hear him breathing, and when he puffs out a loud breath, I realize that he wasn\u2019t breathing at all.</p><p>He scoots to the side and then, with a small amount of reluctance, lies down beside me, bringing the pillow with him. There\u2019s quite a bit of space between our bodies, at least as much as possible with us both being in the sleeping bag. I debate whether to leave the space there or reduce it and irrevocably come to the conclusion that I\u2019ll regret later if I don\u2019t get close to him. Or at least I think I will, anyway.</p><p>I inch my body forward, until I feel the heat emitting from his skin. He holds perfectly still as I rest my forehead to his chest, right against his heart, which is pounding, rock solid and zealous. I can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s scared or excited or what. Then he fixes a finger under my chin and tips my head back. I stare into his eyes, which I can barely see, but feel that they\u2019re on me.</p><p>\u201cNova,\u201d he says in a strained voice. \u201cCan... would it be okay if I kiss you?\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s in the same place as I was the last time I asked him that. Either way, I elongate my body and arch my back, so I can reach his lips with mine.</p><p>Do I want this?</p><p>I brush them softly across his, closing my eyes as his breath eases out and he starts kissing me again with so much fervor I nearly melt. His body ends up on top of mine, and my hands are on his chest, feeling the outlines of his muscles as I drown in his body heat. It\u2019s getting hot and I\u2019m panting for air and everything seems to be moving in fast motion and my thoughts are having a hard time keeping up with what\u2019s going on. Then suddenly he\u2019s sitting me up and ripping my shirt off over my head, and I stop breathing altogether. His dark eyes drink me in, and my body quivers as he reaches around my back for the clasp of my bra. There\u2019s a fleeting moment where I think about shouting for him to stop, that I can\u2019t go any further tonight, but it passes in the blink of an eye as he unhooks my bra. It falls off my chest, and I sit there exposed to him in the heat and the moonlight. My head is racing, searching for numbers or structure, but I can\u2019t find it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d he repeats, and he breathes deeply as he lowers his weight onto me, laying me back down. He supports himself on his arms, placing one on each side of my head, and I open up my legs so he can situate himself between them, and my thoughts speed up as adrenaline courses through my body. It becomes too much, to the point where nothing makes sense and I can\u2019t really tell if I want this or not.</p><p>What do I want? Landon? Him? Something else entirely. I don\u2019t know anymore.</p><p>I\u2019m trying to figure out if I want to stop him, but then I notice how unsteady his hand is as he touches my breast, stroking my nipple, and kissing my neck, as he grinds his body against mine. It calms me down that he\u2019s nervous, which is kind of twisted, but makes sense when I really rationalize it.</p><p>\u201cQuinton,\u201d I groan, as my nipples harden under his touch. I start writhing my hips against him and his hardness, and it makes my body wake up from a very deep sleep. I feel myself climbing so I high, I swear to God I\u2019m going to drift off into the stars. I keep moving and he moves with me, completely in sync. This song is playing outside, one I\u2019ve never heard before, but know I\u2019ll never forget because I\u2019ll never forget this moment. It\u2019s one of those. The kind that gets branded into your mind and you can\u2019t get rid of it, even when you want to.</p><p>After we kiss for an eternity and our bodies are quivering with adrenaline and we\u2019re sweating with passion and overwhelming need and exhaustion, we break apart. I put my shirt back on and then we lay on our backs, neither one of us talking as we stare up at the tent ceiling gently flapping with the breeze. I should feel guilty, but for some reason I feel numb, and through the fogginess of my thoughts, I wonder how I\u2019ll feel in the morning. Landon was the only guy I\u2019d ever done anything with. And now I\u2019m here with Quinton, and he\u2019s alive and nothing makes sense anymore.</p><p>Gone. And just like that my head is filling with numbers, only they have no rhythm and I can\u2019t get them to connect. I clutch at my head, trying to breathe as noiselessly as possible.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you think about the band playing?\u201d Quinton asks.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re okay,\u201d I reply, the numbers floating from my head as I listen to the vamped-up version of one of the band\u2019s more delicate songs, and my heart starts to beat rhythmically again. \u201cBut I like the softer version of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of them,\u201d he confesses, turning his head toward me.</p><p>\u201cWow, I can\u2019t believe you just admitted that to me,\u201d I say. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t be friends with you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what we still are?\u201d he wonders. \u201cFriends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d I admit, sliding my hand down my face, to my neck, then finally resting it on top of my chest. I count the beats of my heart each time it hits my palm. I think about Landon\u2019s and my friendship and how much we knew about each other, yet there was still so much stuff we didn\u2019t. \u201cIt feels like we barely know each other... but I want to get to know you.\u201d The overenthusiastic beat of my heart floods my mind as he stays silent.</p><p>\u201cHow about we play your little game of twenty questions again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did we play that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my room... back when... back when we were high.\u201d</p><p>I thrum my fingers against my ribs. \u201cIsn\u2019t that a dangerous game? One where we both... where we both end up crying.\u201d</p><p>He reaches over and threads his fingers through mine so our hands are entwined on top of my heart. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep it light.\u201d He caresses the top of my hand. \u201cBesides, it really wasn\u2019t the questions, was it?\u201d</p><p>No, it was your eyes and that damn song.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say quietly. \u201cYou go first, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite vacation place?\u201d he asks without missing a beat like he had it planned out the whole time.</p><p>Not a light subject at all, but I answer anyway, because my mind is too weary to conjure up a lie or dodge around it. \u201cIt was actually a road trip. Back when my dad was alive, we\u2019d go on one each summer. My favorite was the one when I was eleven, though... right before he died. He took me to every carnival he could find. It was fun.\u201d Laughter escapes my throat. \u201cI ate way too much cotton candy at one of them and ended up puking on the tilt-a-whirl.\u201d</p><p>He sketches a heart on the back of my hand. \u201cNova... how did he... how did he die?\u201d</p><p>I yawn, zoning in and out of reality. \u201cHe had this heart condition. He didn\u2019t know he had it. We were actually out riding bikes up on these mountain trails and then suddenly he tipped over and he didn\u2019t get up. At first I thought he hurt himself... but then, the look in his eyes... he knew he was going to die and he was scared. I ran back for help and everything, but it was too late. By the time I came back, he was gone.\u201d I\u2019m starting to choke up, because I\u2019ve only talked about what happened with Landon, my mom, and therapists. I suck in a loud breath as the bitter burn of beer stings at the back of my throat. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Here we\u2019re supposed to be playing a light game of twenty questions, and suddenly I\u2019m babbling about death.\u201d</p><p>He slides his hand away from mine, up my chest and to my neck. Pressing his fingers to my jawline, he forces me to look at him through the dark. \u201cI asked you the question after I told you we could make it light. I\u2019m sorry. I should have kept my mouth shut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d I assure him, but it feels like the biggest lie.</p><p>\u201cMy mom died,\u201d he discloses in a subdued voice. \u201cWhen I was born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d I scan his face, but it\u2019s too dark to tell what he\u2019s thinking, but I wish I could tell what\u2019s going on inside of him. Does it match what I look like\u2014what I feel? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be sorry,\u201d he replies with his fingertips still pressed to my jawline. \u201cI just wanted to answer your question from earlier, when you asked if I\u2019d ever lost anyone close to me.\u201d</p><p>My heart is throbbing in my chest as I wonder if maybe one of the names tattooed on him belongs to her. \u201cWhat was her name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnna,\u201d he breathes so softly I can barely hear it. His fingers push harder against my skin.</p><p>But it\u2019s enough to know that it\u2019s not either of the names on his arm.</p> <p>I let a breath ease from my lips. \u201cDid your dad raise you, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answers in a tight tone, pulling his hand away from my face. \u201cBut honestly, I pretty much raised myself.\u201d</p><p>I want to say something comforting, but I can\u2019t think of anything, so I say the first random thing that pops into my head. \u201cIf you could have one wish, what would it be?\u201d</p><p>He pauses and when he speaks again, his voice sounds lighter. \u201cIs that one of your twenty questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d I turn to my side and our fingers untangle from each other. \u201cAnd you\u2019re already down to eighteen.\u201d</p> <p>He captures my cheeks between his hands, bringing me back to him, and even though I\u2019m drunk, I can feel the intimacy in the touch. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you the one wish I would make right now, but I can tell you the one thing I want to do right at this moment.\u201d He sketches his finger down to my lips and brushes his thumb back and forth across the bottom one. \u201cI\u2019d... I\u2019d like to hold you.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know him well enough to know if he\u2019s feeding me a line, but the conflict in his voice, like he\u2019s afraid to say it, makes me believe that he\u2019s not. I inch my body forward so we\u2019re flawlessly aligned from head to toe, and then he brings his fingers away from my face, creating a path down my side. When he reaches my hip, he slips his finger underneath the bottom of my shirt, tenderly skimming my skin and eliciting heat between my thighs, and my body uncontrollably curls into him. But he only does it for a second, then he digs his fingers into my outer thigh and pulls on my leg, hitching it over his hip. Every single aspect of our bodies link perfectly together, and it feels amazing in the sense that it actually is him and me lying here together. There\u2019s no ghost memories, no need to figure out why Landon did it and who I am without him. There\u2019s nothing but silence.</p><p>\u201cIf you could have one superpower, what would it be?\u201d I pick up right where we left off, because I want to continue with this seamless moment of simplicity.</p><p>He smoothes his hand down the back of my head. \u201cThe power to forget. What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe power to understand,\u201d I say, nuzzling my head against his chest as I yawn. \u201cOr the power to save.\u201d</p><p>He keeps smoothing my hair down as he rests his chin on my head. I expect him to question me about my answer, but he doesn\u2019t, and I don\u2019t question him about his.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s one thing you\u2019re afraid of?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cUnknown places,\u201d I say without a second thought.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m unknown,\u201d he points out. \u201cDoes that mean I freak you out?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI already told you that you remind me of someone I used to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that makes me familiar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of... I guess... God, you probably think I\u2019m crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re the most interesting person I\u2019ve met in a long, long time.\u201d He fingers envelop around the back of my head, he slides his chin off the top of my head, and tips his chin down while I angle mine up. We meet in the middle, looking at each other at the precise moment my heart skips a beat.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I kissed you right now?\u201d he asks, his lips mere inches away from mine and his warm breath lightly tickling my skin. \u201cWould that be familiar?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I reply. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t at first, but now...\u201d</p><p>He lightly grazes his lips across mine, gentle and barely existent. \u201cNow what?\u201d</p><p>My thoughts are muddled, and it\u2019s hard for me to picture anything but Quinton. I grip the front of his shirt and crash my lips against his. It\u2019s the fourth time we\u2019ve kissed, and each time it gets easier. I\u2019m still not sure who I\u2019m thinking of when I kiss him. All I know is that at the moment my head is clear and at peace. And maybe that\u2019s my answer. Or maybe that\u2019s what I tell myself to make it easier to kiss him.</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>July 29, Day 71 of Summer Break</p><p>Quinton</p><p>I wake up the next morning feeling a lot more weighted then I did the night before. My first instinct is to slap Tristan awake and ask him where he put the stash. But then I look down at Nova in my arms, and I become conflicted, and I have no idea why. The bad in me wants to bump a hit and disappear, but the good wants to lie here, hold her, and make her happy. It\u2019s strange, because two months ago I had nothing and now suddenly I have something, but I don\u2019t know if I want it. I know I don\u2019t deserve it, but still, want and deserve are two different things.</p><p>I lay in the tent for a while, arguing with myself inside my head, and finally Tristan sits up. He starts rummaging around through his bag, humming to himself, then he notices I\u2019m awake and he frowns.</p><p>\u201cHave fun last night?\u201d he asks, giving an accusing glance at Nova cuddled up against my side.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what you think,\u201d I say, my arm muscles tightening as I decide if I should pull away.</p><p>He opens the small plastic bag and starts packing the pipe. \u201cWhat am I thinking?\u201d</p><p>I glance at Nova. She seems content, motionless, her breathing soft, and I hope she\u2019s asleep. \u201cYou think I slept with her.\u201d</p><p>He laughs acerbically as he closes up the plastic bag and nods his head at Nova, who is sleeping soundly with her head resting on my chest. \u201cWell, you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but we just slept. We didn\u2019t...\u201d I lower my voice. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you kissed her?\u201d he asks, and when I don\u2019t answer he adds, \u201cYou knew I liked her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say, letting out a loud exhale and say the only thing I can think of. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Fuck, I really screwed up... I always do...\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head, he puts the mouth of the pipe up to lips and positions the lighter over the bowl. \u201cSorry doesn\u2019t take back the fact that you kissed her.\u201d He flicks the lighter several times before he gets a constant flame to burn. \u201cI mean, do you even like her, or is this just another one of your Nikki things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like Nikki,\u201d I tell him defensively, as smoke fills up the tent and my mouth begins to salivate.</p><p>He sucks in a deep breath, traps it in his lungs until his eyes start to water, and then releases it. \u201cThen what\u2019s it like?\u201d he says, coughing, smoke puffing from his lips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure yet,\u201d I say, my eyes fixed on the pipe, because every single part of me craves it so fucking bad. I know as soon as I take the first hit, most of my problems will be forgotten for the moment and my life will go back to how it was, where I\u2019m contently high and my emotions are shut off. But do I want to go back to that? \u201cI\u2019m still figuring it out.\u201d</p><p>He assesses me as smoke fills the tent. \u201cWhat if I said to back off? Would you?\u201d</p><p>I feel light-headed from the smoke and the heat circulating in the tent. \u201cYes, but only because I owe you.\u201d It hurts to say it, but it\u2019s the truth. \u201cJust say it\u2014say you want me to back off\u2014and I will.\u201d It feels like an invisible piece of sharp metal reslices the scar on my chest open because I know I\u2019ll do it, back off if he asks me, but it won\u2019t erase the feelings I\u2019m developing for Nova, feelings I thought died over a year ago.</p><p>He keeps his eyes on me with the pipe and lighter in his hands. He glances at Nova, then back at me, and grabs a clean shirt out of his bag. When I first moved into the house, he talked about her a lot. I didn\u2019t get it, because he barely knew her, yet he seemed obsessed with her. But I\u2019m realizing how easy it is to get caught up in her and her sadness and the way she gets nervous and embarrassed and how she seems to see the world in a different light. God, how did I let myself get to this place?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll back off.\u201d He tugs the shirt on, scoots toward the door, and climbs out, taking his pipe with him and letting fresh air inside. Then he leans back in. \u201cI just hope you know what you\u2019re doing, because from what I\u2019ve seen you like to mess around, and she doesn\u2019t seem like that.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s striking a nerve. I remember the first time I slept with someone after Lexi was gone. I was high and there was this girl, and even now I can\u2019t remember her name. She acted like she was into me, and my head was too obscured by alcohol and weed to do anything else but act upon it. After it was over, I felt numb, and feeling numb felt better than feeling the agony, loneliness, and guilt. So I kept screwing around and doing drugs, and after a while it became a part of life for me\u2014a habit.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d I say and it feels like my scar splits open even more.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure,\u201d he replies and I feel both relieved and terrified, because he\u2019s no longer an obstacle, which means I can actually be with Nova. Shit. Guilt, shame, and longing choke me. \u201cI have sort of a thing going on with one of the girls from last night, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to take your pipe out there?\u201d I ask, as he begins to zip the tent back up.</p><p>\u201cYeah... I got some stuff to take care of,\u201d he says, and then he gets the door zipped up entirely, leaving me in the tent with the lingering scent of my weakness. A few moments later, I climb out of the sleeping bag, leaving Nova alone, while I go chase down my addiction.</p><p>After I find Tristan and get my much-needed hits, I don\u2019t go straight back to the tent. I\u2019m not feeling better for some reason, and it\u2019s making me panic inside. Weed usually calms me\u2014clears out the dark thoughts in my head\u2014but now I feel guilty for smoking it, yet I feel guilty when I don\u2019t, and the amount of guilt colliding inside me brings me to the ground.</p><p>Luckily I\u2019ve made it out to the car by the time my knees give out. I draw my knees up toward my chest and rest my arms on top of them, lowering my head. I keep taking deep breaths, telling myself to calm down and breathe, but the fucking problem is I really don\u2019t want to want to breathe at the moment. I want my lungs to stop working, along with my heart, and my thoughts, and my guilt, because I can\u2019t fucking take it anymore. I want to end my life and leave everything behind, but for some damn reason my body won\u2019t respond to what my head wants, like it\u2019s waiting around for me to change my mind.</p><p>Tears start to fall from my eyes and I keep my forehead pressed to my knees, begging for everything to go away. Begging for silence. And all I can do is go back and smoke some more weed and hope it gives silence to me.</p><p>Nova</p><p>I open my eyes to the sunlight blinding me and my cheek resting against someone\u2019s firm chest. At first I start to freak out as I search for the sun, bursting with the need to count the seconds it takes to move over the horizon. But I quickly realize that I\u2019m in a tent, and I can\u2019t see the sun rising because it\u2019s already way too hot and bright for it to barely be waking up. It\u2019s already radiating into the tent and heating up the air in here, and there are a bunch of voices and noises outside that I don\u2019t recognize. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m not sure what to do with the abrupt shift in my routine. On the one hand, I\u2019m glad from the break of lying in bed, waiting for the right moment when I can get up. But on the other hand, it brings an uneasy feeling to my chest because I\u2019m waking up to the unexpected.</p><p>The air is a little steamy inside the tent, and the warm body huddled up against me makes it even hotter. Quinton and I are in a very intimate position; his arm is tucked under my neck and I have my hand on his chest, our bodies folded inward together, like two puzzle pieces.</p><p>I\u2019d woken up the middle of the night, after all the kissing and talking, panicking and feeling like I had a hangover. As I watched him breathing softly in his sleep, I became lost in everything that was him, and a part of me admitted that I was glad I was lying here, with him.</p><p>But now that I\u2019m awake, and my blood is pumping freely again, along with my thoughts, I\u2019m not so sure where I want to be or what I want to be doing. I\u2019m confused. I\u2019m always confused.</p> <p>I sigh, wondering if there will ever be a time when things will be easy and crystal clear again.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d Quinton says in a lazy tone, and I jump from the sound of his voice.</p><p>\u201cJesus, you scared me,\u201d I say, breathless, pressing my hand to my chest as I sit up.</p><p>His eyelids lift open, and it gets to me every time; the honey-brown shade pooled with even more sorrow. \u201cI can tell.\u201d</p><p>I take note of his plaid shirt and black cargo shorts, which is a different outfit from what he was wearing last night. His eyes are red and puffy, but I can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s high or if he\u2019s been crying. \u201cHave you been up already?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I had to... I went to talk to Tristan.\u201d He pauses. \u201cYou know you wiggle a lot in your sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you talk in your sleep.\u201d I say, rubbing the tiredness from my eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d He arches his brow. \u201cWhat\u2019d I say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat Nova is the most awesomest person in the world,\u201d I joke in a tired voice, resting my arm on my stomach.</p><p>He chuckles softly. \u201cYeah, that does seem like something I would say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think I\u2019m awesome?\u201d I fake a frown.</p> <p>He grazes his thumb across my lip. \u201cI think you\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>I strangle down the urge to run out of the tent, because in the light of day\u2014in my refreshed mind\u2014the word is harder to hear. \u201cYou keep saying that.\u201d</p><p>He gives me a big, goofy grin that looks so out of place on his face it can probably only mean one thing. He\u2019s stoned. \u201cThat\u2019s because you are.\u201d He explores my body with his penetrating eyes, making sure to cover every inch, and even though he\u2019s not touching me, it feels like he\u2019s touching me all over. When his eyes rest on mine again, he seems uncertain. \u201cI think...\u201d He shuts his eyes, his expression contorted in pain. \u201cI really want to draw you, Nova.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure if I can let you,\u201d I utter softly.</p><p>His eyes open and the pain hidden in his pupils is magnified. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if I can.\u201d He massages his forehead with his heel of his hand, like he\u2019s trying to rub away the stress. His shirt sleeve slips down a little, revealing the names tattooed on his arm.</p><p>\u201cWho are Ryder and Lexi?\u201d I ask, extending my fingers to touch the names inked on his skin.</p><p>He stiffens and then slides his arm out from underneath me. \u201cHow about I go find us some breakfast or something?\u201d His voice is tight, nearly a shout as he ruffles his hair into place with his hand. Without waiting for me to respond, he unzips the tent and leaves me alone with my question echoing in my head.</p><p>I start to get up to see if he\u2019s okay, but my stomach rolls with nausea from all the beer I drank last night, and I lay back down with my arm over my head. I stare at the ceiling, recollecting every time Landon had run away from me when I asked the wrong question. Then one night he\u2019d taken off and never returned, just like that. Just like Quinton\u2019s doing.</p> <p>Without taking my eyes off the ceiling, I stretch my arm out and feel around the side of the tent until I find my phone. I open the Landon file, staring at it, counting the seconds down. But when I hit two minutes, I feel too tired to keep going, weighted down by worry, anxiety, my bad decisions, and my exhausting routine. For the first time in over a year, I skip out on the last three minutes of my routine. My limbs and fingers feel heavy as I click the camera on, noting the paleness of my skin and the redness in my puffy eyes as I clear my throat before speaking.</p><p>\u201cI remember the night I went to visit Landon\u2019s grave. It wasn\u2019t too long after they put the headstone on his grave.\u201d My voice sounds hoarse. \u201cIt was my mom that suggested we go visit\u2014\u2018Maybe we can go with the Evanses\u2019\u2014like it was a great idea or something.\u201d</p><p>I stare at my eyes, begging them to show me what I\u2019m feeling on the inside. \u201cIt\u2019d been a couple of months since he was buried, and I\u2019d barely made it through his funeral... well, barely might be exaggerating. I\u2019d puked my guts out in the bathroom afterward. I think deep down I knew I wasn\u2019t ready to go to his grave, but I couldn\u2019t admit it to my mother... or maybe to myself. Going and staring at a stone that marked the date he was born and the day he decided to go...\u201d I suck in a breath. \u201cYet, I\u2019d agreed, because that\u2019s what I always did, I agree and go along with things because I could never think of an excuse.\u201d</p><p>My hand trembles as a tear rolls down my cheek. \u201cSo we went with the Evanses, and his mom cried the entire time, and so did my mom. I probably should have said something\u2014or done something\u2014to make it easier for everyone, but all I could do was stand there.\u201d More tears flood my eyes, but I don\u2019t move, capturing the realness of the moment. \u201cI felt disconnected, like it wasn\u2019t real, like someone had made a mistake and put the wrong name on the headstone and that really Landon was at home sketching the mountains or maybe the trees outside while he smoked weed and lost track of time, because that seemed more plausible then him deciding he\u2019d rather be underneath the ground than up here with me.\u201d</p><p>I pause as my emotions become too uncontrollable and I begin to chatter. \u201cAfter the visit was over, I went home and... I don\u2019t know...\u201d My eyebrows knit. \u201cI just wanted to understand what he felt like right at the end... what the hell he was thinking that made him go through with it. So I went into the bathroom and started cutting my wrist open. It\u2019s not like I wanted to die... at least I don\u2019t think so. Honestly, I have no idea what I wanted or want. An explanation? A way to travel back through time? A way to do everything differently? Or maybe I\u2019d just lost myself with Landon\u2014\u201d</p><p>The sound of the door zipper moving causes me to drop my phone. I quickly sit up, wiping my eyes with the back of my hand right as Quinton sticks his head in. My teeth are still clattering together and there are a few stray tears on my face.</p><p>\u201cI think I...\u201d His voice trails off as he takes in the sight of me. \u201cNova, are you okay? What the hell happened?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, stretching the bottom of my tank top up to my cheeks to clean off my face. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>He crawls into the tent, zips the door up, and kneels down in front of me, appearing regretful. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I kind of yelled at you... I just... I don\u2019t even know why I did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d I assure him, pulling the bottom of my shirt back down over my stomach. \u201cThat\u2019s not why I\u2019m crying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he replies, releasing an uneven breath. \u201cBut I needed to say it... I feel bad yelling. I should have never raised my voice at you.\u201d</p><p>It feels like I need to say a lot of things, because I didn\u2019t say so much when I was with Landon. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I promise... But...\u201d I struggle for the right words that can maybe get him to open up to me, but my mind is exhausted from the alcohol last night and thoughts of Landon just now, so no words ever come. \u201cNothing. Never mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d he asks. \u201cYou can... you can talk to me if you want to, Nova.\u201d</p><p>I force a smile. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I promise.\u201d</p><p>He smiles back, but it\u2019s a sad smile. He starts to scoot back toward the door, taking hold of my hand, and his palms feel a little sweaty. \u201cNow, come on. I just found out that there\u2019s this little diner place like three miles up the road, so we can actually have real food instead of granola bars and that shit we ate last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it was hot dogs. That\u2019s why we put them on the hot dog forks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey may have been hot dogs, but they sure as hell didn\u2019t taste like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Delilah burnt them,\u201d I say. \u201cShe sucks at cooking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I,\u201d he states. \u201cI once burned a Hot Pocket in the microwave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you burn a Hot Pocket in the microwave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy leaving it in there for over ten minutes,\u201d he says with an amused grin. \u201cI was high, and instead of trying to set the time, I just pushed a bunch of buttons, figuring it\u2019d work. I still ate it, though.\u201d</p><p>We smile at each other, on the verge of laughing, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s real or if it\u2019s just something we know we\u2019re supposed to do, and as quickly as it ascends, we\u2019re sinking back into the desolation again.</p><p>He stops in front of the door and traces the folds between my fingers. \u201cNova, I really like you... but there are things... stuff that I can\u2019t talk about. I\u2019m not sure if I can be with you like I was last night.\u201d</p><p>An elongated pause passes between us. He continues to trace the folds in my fingers with his head tucked down, and I analyze his demeanor, sad and broken, and God, I hate to think it, what if he\u2019s suicidal? What if below the surface, there\u2019s even more pain eating away at him, and I\u2019m the only one who sees it because I\u2019ve seen it before but didn\u2019t recognize it until it was too late? I\u2019m about to ask him why he\u2019s so sad, even if it means getting yelled out or hated or completely jumping out of my comfort zone.</p><p>\u201cI have to ask you something,\u201d he says, before I get a chance. \u201cAnd as much as I hate to ask it, because I hate being nosy, it\u2019s going to bug me if I don\u2019t.\u201d He peers up at me.</p><p>My chest tightens in anticipation. \u201cOkay...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you... were you just talking to yourself in here?\u201d he asks and then quickly adds, \u201cI mean, it\u2019s cool and everything... we all do it... but you were crying so...\u201d</p><p>So he thinks I\u2019m crazy. \u201cYes and no.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cCare to elaborate?\u201d he asks with an oh-shit-please-don\u2019t-let-her-be-insane look.</p><p>Not really. \u201cI just...\u201d I try to think of a lie, because telling him about my video-making endeavor feels too private. But he has my hand in his and it\u2019s comforting and familiar, and all I want to do is tell him the truth, like I used to do with Landon. \u201cI\u2019m making this video...\u201d I trail off as his expression abruptly alters from confused to amused. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Balling his hand into a fist, he covers his mouth with his hand, hiding a smile. \u201cLike a sex video?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat... no!\u201d I swat his arm, shaking my head. \u201cWhy the hell would you ask that? I was in here by myself.\u201d</p><p>He lowers his hand from his mouth, humor lacing his voice. \u201cOh, you can make a sex video by yourself.\u201d</p><p>My cheeks flush and I grab the pillow beside me, hugging it with one arm, as I bury my face into it to hide my mortification. \u201cWell, that\u2019s not what I was doing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat kind of video then?\u201d he asks with interest, and I peek up at him. His hand is on his lap and his fingers are softly stroking my wrist.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a video about me,\u201d I say, shivering when his finger grazes a sensitive area on my arm. \u201cOr my thoughts. I guess kind of like a documentary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr like a Novamentary,\u201d he says. The moment is so real, so raw and fresh, that I can\u2019t help but want to find a way to capture it and keep it forever, because soon it will be replaced by alcohol and weed or numbers and order. Tossing the pillow aside, I pick up my phone. \u201cHow about you say something for my Novamentary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to record me?\u201d he questions warily, and I nod. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not that great on video.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither am I.\u201d I aim the phone camera at him, and I have to admit he looks stunningly beautiful on it; clear honey-brown eyes, long lashes, short, soft hair, and very kissable lips. \u201cDelilah did it, but you don\u2019t have to if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d I keep the camera aimed at him for a little bit longer and then start to lower it when he doesn\u2019t say anything.</p> <p>\u201cWait.\u201d He compresses my wrist between his fingers. \u201cI\u2019ll say something.\u201d He pauses. \u201cDo you want honesty?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m taken back by his question, but nod. \u201cIf you\u2019re comfortable with it.\u201d</p><p>He releases my wrist from between his fingers and scoots away from me. I think he\u2019s going to leave, but then he crisscrosses his legs and supports his elbows on his knees. \u201cOnce upon a time there was this guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were going to tell something honest,\u201d I interrupt. \u201cNot a fairy tale.\u201d</p><p>He holds up a finger. \u201cGive me a minute... I promise it\u2019s not a fairy tale.\u201d</p><p>I relax, watching him through the screen as he cracks his knuckles and pops his neck, then stirs in his own silence. His neck muscles are rigid and his skin has gone pale.</p> <p>\u201cOnce upon a time there was this guy,\u201d he starts over. \u201cAnd he was a good guy. The kind that girls could take back to their parents and who held open doors and who fell in love with the girl he knew he was going to marry.\u201d His forehead furrows and he gazes over my shoulder. \u201cOr at least that\u2019s what he believed... but shit happened and the guy ended up dying, only somehow he made it back, but the good in him remained dead and all that was left was this really bad guy who fucks up shit and who really, really wishes he\u2019d stayed dead.\u201d</p><p>He stops and blinks, and for a moment it looks like he\u2019s forgotten where he is, who I am, and who the hell he is. We stare at each other, and I\u2019m trying to figure out what to say to him because he\u2019s openly talking to me\u2014or the camera, anyway\u2014and the pain I\u2019ve seen inside him is slipping out through his words. I want to ask him how the guy died, what happened to the girl, and why the guy thinks he\u2019s such a bad person.</p><p>I lower the camera. \u201cWhy do you think you\u2019re a bad guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I am,\u201d he says it so simply as if it\u2019s factual, but from what I\u2019ve seen\u2014from what I\u2019m seeing right now\u2014he\u2019s not.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not,\u201d I say. \u201cNot even close.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cYou don\u2019t even know me, Nova, so you can\u2019t say that about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know some things about you,\u201d I tell him. \u201cYou make me smile, and no one\u2019s done that in a very long time.\u201d</p><p>He offers me a halfhearted smile. \u201cJust because I can make you smile doesn\u2019t mean I deserve to smile.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy? Because you do drugs? Or... or is it because of something else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s everything.\u201d He almost sounds frustrated, as if he wants me to stop telling him he\u2019s good. \u201cEverything I do\u2014have done\u2014is bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d I tell him and set the camera down on the floor. \u201cWhat we do doesn\u2019t define us, although I think some people would probably disagree with me.\u201d I scoot forward and only stop moving when our knees touch\u2014when I make a connection with him. \u201cI think that sometimes things just get confusing and we get lost, and sometimes you can\u2019t figure out which path is the right path... which is the right decision.\u201d Quit or move forward. Heal or break. Fight or die. I\u2019m still figuring that out.</p><p>His eyes crinkle around the corners as his expression softens. \u201cAre you confused and lost, Nova?\u201d</p><p>I nod and I feel something break inside as my confession hovers between us. \u201cAll the damn time.\u201d</p><p>He swallows hard. \u201cI completely understand where you\u2019re coming from.\u201d He sucks in a breath, and then the mood shifts as he rubs his hands together. \u201cSo how about some breakfast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBreakfast sounds good,\u201d I tell him, which seems extremely ordinary after the conversation we just had. But sometimes ordinary is a good break from complexity, I guess. Or maybe there\u2019s just nothing left to say.</p><p>He uncrosses his legs, kneels up, and unzips the tent door. \u201cNow, is there anything you don\u2019t like to eat, besides melted ice cream?\u201d He crawls out of the tent into the sunlight.</p><p>\u201cBurnt hot dogs.\u201d I joke as I crawl out of the tent behind him. \u201cOr how about Hot Pockets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, no more burnt hot dogs. Or Hot Pockets,\u201d he says, offering me one hand as he brushes the dirt off his knees with the other.</p><p>I place my hand in his, and he interlaces our fingers, then lifts me to my feet. I breathe in the fresh air and tip my face up to the sun. It\u2019s a nice day, with only a few clouds spotting the sky. The stage is empty and the field is fairly vacant.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s everyone?\u201d I ask, stretching like a cat in the sunshine.</p><p>He smiles, amused at something. \u201cI think they wandered off to the lake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe lake?\u201d I tug at the bottom of my tank top, covering my stomach back up.</p><p>He nods and then walks around the tent, towing me along with him. \u201cYeah, they went to get clean, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy taking a bath in a lake?\u201d I ask, maneuvering around coolers and fold-up chairs.</p><p>He shrugs, kicking a bottle out of our path. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s not that big of a deal. I think they have their clothes on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d I ask and then realize how immature I sound.</p><p>He shakes his head, wrapping his arm around my shoulder, and then he surprises me by kissing my forehead. \u201cActually, I don\u2019t think. I went down there a little earlier, and for some reason everyone seems to think this is a nudist colony. Or they all might be tripping on something that gives them that whole I\u2019m-free vibe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy were you down there?\u201d I scoot to the side out of the way of a tent.</p><p>He glances down at me inquisitively, and his eyes look lighter in the sunlight. \u201cIs that your way of asking if I was down there joining in the nakedness, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of,\u201d I admit, even though my cheeks heat. I chew on my nails, letting my hair fall down to the side of my face. \u201cI don\u2019t know a lot about you, and it would be nice to know if you\u2019re into stripping down in front of a bunch of people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Would you hate me if I said yes?\u201d he asks seriously.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo, I just want to know more about you.\u201d</p><p>He gazes at me quizzically as we veer around a dropped tailgate that\u2019s littered with beer boxes and cigarette butts. \u201cWell, the answer is no. I actually hate being naked in front of people.\u201d</p><p>I tuck my hair behind my ear and gaze up at the clear sky. When I look back at him I find him staring at me. \u201cWhat?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m waiting for your answer,\u201d he says, slowing us down as we reach Tristan\u2019s rusted old Cadillac.</p><p>\u201cMy answer for...\u201d</p><p>He takes the keys out of his pocket. \u201cOn whether or not you\u2019re the kind of person who likes to get naked in front of other people.\u201d</p><p>I bite down on my lip and shake my head. \u201cNo, not really.\u201d</p><p>He smiles as he unlocks the car door. \u201cGood, now we have something in common.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that the only thing we have in common?\u201d I catch the keys as he tosses them to me.</p><p>He stares into my eyes, and I wonder what the hell he can see in them. \u201cNo, I think we share a lot more.\u201d He scratches at his head as he considers something. \u201cCan you drive? I don\u2019t think I should.\u201d</p><p>I wonder if it has to do with being under the influence or if it\u2019s related to what Tristan said. I wonder a lot of things about him, about me, about him and me together, and why I seem like a different person around him, like I get lost in him instead of numbers, control, and order. My thoughts drift off as something strikes the inside of my head like a lightning bolt. Is that how I was with Landon? Lost? Different? I\u2019d been so consumed by him when he was alive. Have I ever really known who I was?</p><p>I climb in and turn the engine on while Quinton rounds the front of the car and climbs in. I start to back up when he says, \u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>I tap on the brakes, panicking, thinking I\u2019m about to run over someone or something. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I ask, glancing in the rearview mirror, but the dirt road behind me is empty.</p><p>His eyes are slightly wide as he leans over the console, stretching his arm across the front of my chest. Then he grabs the seat belt, pulls it over my chest, and buckles me in. I wait for him to buckle his own, but he relaxes back in his seat, and remains still.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to put yours on, too?\u201d I ask, letting the car slowly roll backward.</p><p>He shakes his head stubbornly. \u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuinton, I...\u201d I trial off as he turns his head toward the window and folds his arms.</p><p>\u201cI said I\u2019m good,\u201d he says in a tight voice, gesturing at the shifter. \u201cNow let\u2019s go get some breakfast.\u201d</p><p>I want to argue with him, but how the hell am I supposed to force someone to do something they obviously are dead set on not doing. Sighing, I press on the gas, maneuvering the car around potholes. The closer I get to the main road, the more pissed off I get, because he won\u2019t put his seat belt on, and I know he\u2019s probably done a ton of other things that put his life at risk, but this makes it seem like he doesn\u2019t value his life at all, which makes me even more agitated.</p><p>Finally, I stomp on the brake a little too hard and it sends us both forward. My seat belt locks, but because he doesn\u2019t have one on, he ends up hitting his head on the dashboard.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d he curses, rubbing his head, and then stares at me coldly. \u201cWhy the fuck did you do that?\u201d</p><p>My foot that\u2019s holding down the brake is shaking as I stare straight ahead. \u201cBecause I want you to put your seat belt on.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He pauses. \u201cNova, it\u2019s really my decision whether I want to wear one or not.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, my jaw set tight. \u201cNo it\u2019s not. Regardless of your fucking reason for not putting one on, if anything happens then everyone who ever cared about you will be left hurting and missing you and probably pissed off because you chose not to put your seat belt on.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a long pause as my words and sharp tone startle both of us.</p><p>\u201cNo one cares about me, so it\u2019s fine,\u201d he states with indifference. \u201cAnd I never wear one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI care about you,\u201d I insist, and my chest compresses as I realize that it\u2019s the truth. The painful, inconceivable, unplanned truth. I care about him. My breath shakes as I say, \u201cSo, if not for you, will you please put it on for me?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s quiet for a while, and I think he\u2019s going to refuse. I get ready to drive forward, back to the field, and skip out on breakfast, when he sighs and straps his belt on.</p><p>\u201cThere, are you happy?\u201d he mutters, slumping back in the seat.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I shove the car into drive, feeling a little bit lighter, like I might have just done something right.</p><p>Quinton</p> <p>She\u2019s still pissed off about the seat belt even when we arrive at the restaurant. I don\u2019t really think it has to do with me not putting on my seat belt and more with the fact that I\u2019m not cherishing my life. I\u2019m still trying to process the fact that she cares about me enough to want me to put on my seat belt. Part of me is angry with myself for allowing things to get this complicated between us, for letting her in enough that she actually cares about my life. She shouldn\u2019t be caring about it. It\u2019s worthless. I\u2019m worthless. I may be walking around, breathing, heart beating, blood running through my veins, but my existence, my soul, everything that made me who I was is dead. At least I thought it was. But there\u2019s another part of me, one that\u2019s been repressed for a very long time, that relishes in the fact that she cares about my life\u2014about me.</p><p>I was torn with putting the seat belt on, because I really don\u2019t care what happens to me, and I sometimes secretly hope that something bad will happen and I\u2019ll finally be able to be buried with everything one else, beneath the ground, right where I\u2019m supposed to be. But in the end I give in to Nova, because I remember what happened to her boyfriend and how it probably has something to do with that. But I know that by giving in to her, I\u2019m admitting that I\u2019m developing feelings for her, so I try to mentally picture Lexi during the drive. It becomes harder with each movement Nova makes, though, like when she fiddles with the keys and adjusts the mirror, because it makes her real, and the images of Lexi just memories.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t talk to me the entire drive, only nodding when I give her directions. It takes a few minutes to get up to the restaurant because the road is rocky and bumpy and made more for four-wheel-drive vehicles.</p><p>Finally we pull up to a small log cabin in the center of the trees. There are flashing neon signs on the windows and twinkle lights trimming the roof, along with a few around the doorway. Plants and flowers and trees surround the path that leads to the entrance, and the sun shines down through the branches above, making everything fun and cheerful on the outside.</p><p>She turns off the engine, removes the keys, and opens the door to climb out.</p><p>\u201cNova, wait,\u201d I say, unclicking my seat belt, and mentally screaming at myself to keep my mouth shut and let her remain angry with me.</p> <p>She pauses with her legs out of the car and her back turn to me as she adjusts one of her fallen straps on her red shirt back over her shoulder. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Just let her be. \u201cI\u2019m... I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>She glances over her shoulder at me and locks of her hair fall across her bare shoulders. \u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor being an ass,\u201d I tell her, letting the seat belt slide up into the wall.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d She gets out of the car and stuffs the keys into the pocket of her short denim shorts.</p><p>I climb out of the car and meet her at the front of the car. She doesn\u2019t say a word as we walk into the restaurant, where it seems the entire concert has flocked to. We manage to find a small booth at the back, squished between the back door and the kitchen. It\u2019s noisy, but our table is agonizingly quiet because Nova\u2019s not talking to me. The waitress comes and takes our orders. Nova starts fiddling with the salt shaker, twirling it around in her hand. I\u2019m searching my mind for something to say, but nothing seems right, and I\u2019m beginning to think I should just let her stay upset with me when she just starts talking.</p><p>\u201cYou just seemed like you didn\u2019t want to wear it because you were...\u201d She spills a little salt and sweeps it off the table and onto the floor with her hand. \u201cBecause you were sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t because of that,\u201d I lie, unrolling the silverware from the napkin.</p> <p>\u201cBut that\u2019s what it seemed like.\u201d She\u2019s still staring at the table and it looks like her eyes are getting watery. \u201cAnd I had someone... close to me... a friend who stopped... doing stuff because of the sadness.\u201d She bites on her trembling lip so hard she draws blood.</p><p>\u201cNova, I...\u201d I have no fucking idea what to say to her.</p><p>\u201cIt was my boyfriend,\u201d she whispers, and tears stream down her cheek. \u201cAnd he was sad and then he stopped doing everything.\u201d Her voice is trembling, and she\u2019s sniffling as she wipes the tears away from her eyes. But more tears escape her eyes and drip all over her skin, and the tabletop beneath her ends up soaked with her grief.</p><p>I\u2019m the last person she should be talking to this about, because I think about it all the time. I think about stopping everything because of the sadness. But she\u2019s crying, and it hurts to watch, so I end up climbing out of my side of the booth and sliding into hers. She starts to sob as soon as my shoulder touches hers and then she buries her face into my chest, drenching it with her tears. I place my hand on the back of her hand and hold her, because it\u2019s all I can do, because I know death hurts, death breaks, death consumes, and there\u2019s no magic cure to making it go away.</p><p>I let her cry for as long as she needs with my arm around her shoulder. Even when she stops sobbing, she keeps her face pressed against my chest. The waitress drops off our food, giving us a strange look, but I shrug it off and wait. Finally, when the food\u2019s getting cold, Nova pulls back.</p><p>Her cheeks are stained red and her eyes are swollen. \u201cI\u2019m sorry... I have no idea why I just did that.\u201d</p><p>I brush my finger up her cheek to wipe away the tears, but her skin is sensitive and she winces, so I lean forward and softly place a kiss to each of her cheeks instead. Shutting my eyes, I allow myself one second to enjoy the moment. Then I move back and look her in the eye. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>She nods and opens her mouth, but her stomach decides to rumble really loud and it makes me smile and her laugh. \u201cI think maybe I should eat, though.\u201d</p><p>She starts to unroll her silverware, her mouth turned downward. \u201cQuinton?\u201d</p><p>I pick up my fork, ready to devour the food. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she says quietly in a hoarse voice.</p><p>It\u2019s amazing how to two words can mean so much. I nod with my eyes on my food, and we dig into our eggs, pancakes, and toast, keeping the conversation light. By the time we head back to the car, we\u2019ve got full bellies and are feeling content with one another. When we climb into the car, I put my seat belt on without her asking, even though I don\u2019t want to\u2014I do it for her. She doesn\u2019t say anything, but it makes her smile, and for a brief moment I smile, too.</p><p>Nova</p><p>I feel bad for crying in front of him, but at the same time I don\u2019t think I could have helped it. I was too overwhelmed and, honestly, I\u2019m just exhausted. Of being who I am. Of not knowing who I am. And of always being confused. I\u2019m starting to wonder what it would be like to move on past the numbers and finally start to breathe again. Although it doesn\u2019t seem entirely possible, the idea of doing it seems less tiring. Perhaps I could stop, but then what? What would become of me? Would the past crush me?</p><p>Later that evening we\u2019re sitting in front of a fire, and the night sky looks like a blanket sprinkled with stars above us. Dylan surrounded a small area with rocks so we could cook dinner on a fire, even though he never ate dinner himself. Then we all sat around the fire, drinking beers, laughing, and drinking. One of my favorite bands is playing, and I\u2019m sitting on Quinton\u2019s lap singing along with the lyrics.</p><p>\u201cHey, I have an idea,\u201d Delilah announces as she picks at the overly cooked marshmallow on the end of her stick. \u201cLet\u2019s play truth or dare.\u201d</p><p>Dylan shoots her a dirty look as he stirs the fire, the logs inside it hissing and smoldering. \u201cI already made it pretty clear that I fucking hate games.\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes as she puts a blob of marshmallow into her mouth, and then wipes her sticky fingers on the side of her shorts. \u201cThen you can watch.\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head, Dylan returns back to his chair by the cooler. \u201cDo whatever the hell you want as long as I\u2019m not a part of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll play,\u201d I tell her, sticking the hot dog fork into the fire. I have three marshmallows on it and they instantly start to bubble against the flame. \u201cI like games.\u201d</p><p>Quinton smiles up at me, squeezing my hips. \u201cI know you do,\u201d he says with honesty, and it\u2019s strange because he does know that part of me, which means he\u2019s getting to know me. He looks over at Delilah, who\u2019s sitting on a log beside Tristan. \u201cI\u2019m game.\u201d</p><p>The three of us stare at Tristan and he looks hesitant, but shrugs. \u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>Delilah slaps her hand against her knee and shoves the rest of her burned marshmallow into her mouth. \u201cOkay, who wants to go first?\u201d When no one offers, she adds. \u201cOkay, I will then.\u201d She balances the stick on the rocks in front of her feet and then swallows the mouth full of marshmallows. \u201cOkay, mine\u2019s for Nova, and if you turn down the question or the dare you have to take a shot.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, I gulp down the rest of my beer. \u201cAll right, I choose truth.\u201d</p><p>She sticks out her tongue at me. \u201cI so knew you would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell does that mean?\u201d I ask, offended.</p><p>\u201cIt means you\u2019re predictable,\u201d she says, kind of being a bitch.</p><p>I\u2019d say more to her, but everyone is watching, so all I say is, \u201cWhat\u2019s your question?\u201d</p><p>She wavers, staring up at the sky thoughtfully. \u201cHave you ever made out with a guy just because you were drunk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I have,\u201d I answer in a tight voice, glaring at her, wondering what the hell her problem is. Is she just being a bitch because she\u2019s mad at me for something, or is she on something? Out of the corner of my eye I catch Tristan looking at me, and it makes me extremely uncomfortable. \u201cSo I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re asking it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause truth or dare is all about causing drama, and I thought that one would,\u201d Delilah replies, then waits for a soap opera scene to unfold. But it never happens. Yes, there\u2019s awkwardness between Tristan and me, and Quinton seems to be a little uncomfortable, too, but thankfully no one says anything. Looking disappointed, Delilah leans back on the log, resting her weight on her palms. \u201cQuinton, truth or dare?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He shrugs and I feel his chest rise and fall as he lets out a tired sigh. \u201cDare, I guess.\u201d</p><p>A devious grin creeps across Delilah\u2019s face and she looks evil in the firelight. \u201cI dare you to kiss me.\u201d</p><p>I tense, knowing I shouldn\u2019t, because he\u2019s not my boyfriend or anything, and I\u2019m not even sure what I want from him. All I know is that I don\u2019t want to share him. I glance over at Dylan, who simply shrugs and pops the top off another beer.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what she fucking does,\u201d he says and throws his head back, guzzling the beer.</p> <p>Everyone kind of glances around uncomfortably, then Quinton shifts his weight. \u201cNova, can you get up?\u201d</p><p>I nod, quickly stand up, and shuffle to the side. I consider running out into the crowd, instead of watching, but I can\u2019t determine which one is more painful to endure. So I stand there next to the fire, trying not to cry as he makes his way around the fire toward Delilah. I can feel Tristan watching me, and Delilah wets her lips with her tongue in anticipation. I\u2019m not sure why she\u2019s doing it. Is this just a side of her I\u2019ve never seen or is it the drugs, because I\u2019m beginning to understand that they can make a person act completely different from the ordinary character. Happier. Sadder. Angrier. Bitchier.</p><p>Quinton gets to his feet and heads in Delilah\u2019s direction. Right as he\u2019s about to reach her, he veers to the left toward the box of alcohol bottles nestled up next to the tent. He selects a bottle of cheap vodka, and twists off the cap. Putting the bottle to his lips, he bends his head back and knocks back a shot. \u201cI\u2019m declining on this one,\u201d he says, his muscles twitching as the burn of the alcohol gets to him.</p><p>Delilah shrugs as he sets the bottle back into the box. \u201cYour loss.\u201d</p><p>She grins at me and I don\u2019t know why, because I really want to hit her. And then I realize that the fact that I want to hit her means I might be feeling something for Quinton, and I\u2019m not sure how to handle that. I\u2019m about to get up and knock back my own shot, when Quinton walks up to me and holds out his hand.</p> <p>\u201cHow about we ditch the game and go for a walk?\u201d Quinton asks me with his hand extended out.</p><p>I nod and lace my fingers through his, the contact instantly giving me a sense of familiarity. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Delilah protests, sitting up straight like she\u2019s about to stand up. \u201cWe have to finish the game first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m done with the game,\u201d I say, letting Quinton pull me to my feet. We hike toward the field, holding hands, and the inside of me feels momentarily peaceful.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Tristan calls out, as he retrieves his pipe from his pocket. \u201cDon\u2019t you guys want to smoke a bowl first?\u201d</p><p>I start to say yes, but Quinton shakes his head. \u201cWe\u2019re good.\u201d</p> <p>I get a little annoyed that he says \u201cwe\u2019re\u201d as if he\u2019s my spokesman. But he\u2019s holding my hand and it feels warm against mine, not cold, which means he\u2019s here. With me. Not ready to leave. Without me.</p><p>We walk away from the fire and the silly little game, heading out into the quiet field behind the tents, the one just in front of the forest. He finds a rock for us to sit on, and then we climb up on it, sitting by each other but not touching.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what to think of her,\u201d he states, gazing at the fiery glow of the stage lights gleaming in the distance.</p><p>I draw a pattern in a patch of dirt beside my leg on the rock. \u201cWho, Delilah?\u201d</p><p>He nods, his gaze sliding to me, his honey-brown eyes a shadow against the darkness and the trickle of light from the full moon. \u201cYou two are so different. How did you become friends with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went through some stuff...\u201d I trail off and shrug. \u201cShe was there for me when no one else was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s kind of hard to believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s true.\u201d I mull over the question in my head and then finally just say it. \u201cIs that why you didn\u2019t kiss her? Because you\u2019re not sure about her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m not sure about a lot of things, and that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t kiss her.\u201d He stares down at the section of rock between us where our fingers are only inches away from each other\u2019s. \u201cI know one thing, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, what\u2019s that?\u201d I stare down at our hands, too, so close, yet they still seem so far away.</p><p>He glances up at me the same time I glance up at him, and the intensity in his expression thrusts my equilibrium off balance, and I feel dizzy. \u201cThat I really want to kiss you,\u201d he utters softly.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I blame my eager response on the alcohol in my system, or perhaps it\u2019s just really what I want at the moment.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d he questions, eyeing my mouth. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t want to... that thing at the restaurant\u2014\u201d</p><p>I crash my lips into his, because I\u2019m caught up in the moment and I want to taste him again and I want to avoid taking a detour down memory lane again. I\u2019ve never really instigated a kiss before, and it makes my adrenaline skyrocket and I shiver from the rush and the high. But soon my emotions calm as we settle on the rock with his body positioned over mine. His tongue moves slowly, but deliberately as he explores my mouth, while my fingers slide underneath his shirt. He has his knee between my legs, and with each movement our mouths make, his knee matches the smooth motion, rubbing between my legs. When he hits the right spot, a tingling sensation erupts all over my body, and it makes me moan as my fingertips press down against his abs. I feel like I\u2019m flying yet falling at the same time, spinning out of control like I\u2019m stuck on a carnival ride and I\u2019m not sure how the hell to get off it. Then my head starts to spin as his fingers sneak up the bottom of my shorts, gradually and softly dousing my skin in heat. I tense, wanting to tell him to stop, yet my lips stay sealed to his, because I can\u2019t seem to find the willpower or desire to break the kiss.</p><p>He slips a finger inside me but then he pauses, propping up on his elbows to look me in the eyes. \u201cIs this okay?\u201d</p><p>No. I nod. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>A deliberate exhale releases from his lips, like he\u2019s nervous and was hoping I\u2019d say no. Then he\u2019s kissing me and feeling me from the inside, as our bodies move in harmony like the song playing onstage, and for the briefest of seconds, in the darkness and scarred world that surrounds us, there is a split moment of perfection. The cluster of emotions swarming in my head and body make me feel like I\u2019m going to explode, and I cling to his arms as I move my mouth away from his, tipping my head back, falling deeper into the perfection. When it\u2019s all over, he lays us back on the rock and holds me, combing his fingers through my hair, as I slowly return to the scarred world around us.</p><p>I have a weird sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as we stare at the stars and exhaustion attempts to take us over, my mind and body becoming heavier and groggier with images of the last time I lay under the stars at night. I don\u2019t want to go to sleep, because I\u2019m afraid of what I\u2019ll wake up to. Or what I won\u2019t wake up to.</p><p>\u201cDo you ever think about the future?\u201d I ask him, breaking the silence.</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d he replies, tensing, his fingers tangled in my hair. \u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes, but I never really see anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing at all?\u201d</p><p>I trace a long line up and down his chest with my finger, right where I know the scar is hidden under the fabric. \u201cI used to. A lot. But in the end, it\u2019s pretty much pointless, because it doesn\u2019t matter what you want or plan. You never end up getting it.\u201d</p><p>At first he doesn\u2019t respond, and I think it\u2019s because he agrees with me. Then he transfers his weight to the side and scoots down so he\u2019s at eye level with me. He places a hand on each of my cheeks and looks me in the eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I think,\u201d he says, vining his legs around mine. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to have a really amazing future, full of drumsticks, and songs and videos, and anything else you want, because one day you\u2019re going to wake up from all of this and realize that you\u2019re too good to be here.\u201d</p><p>His words slam against my chest because he doesn\u2019t mean them. Not really. He doesn\u2019t even know me. My lips part to tell him that. \u201cI think that\u2014\u201d</p><p>His lips collide with mine and it\u2019s the final thing we say to each other. We kiss until the stars begin to dwindle, and then we hold on to each other, clutching at something I\u2019m not sure really exists. It could all be just an illusion. Like Landon and I were. Maybe I\u2019m feeling things for him and he\u2019s feeling things for me, but maybe not. Maybe what\u2019s on the outside isn\u2019t necessarily what\u2019s on the inside.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>July 30, Day 72 of Summer Break</p><p>Nova</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is with the rain?\u201d Delilah frowns at the muddy mess that has become the field. \u201cThis sucks.\u201d</p><p>She and I are sitting in the tent with the door open, watching the sky drizzle against the ground, as she smokes from the pipe and I occasionally take a few hits. People are out in the field, though, as the band plays without their amps, the music muffled by the vibration of the thunder and the lightning and the raindrops colliding with the ground. Quinton, Tristan, and Dylan took off a little while ago, being very vague about where they were going.</p><p>\u201cIf it keeps up\u201d\u2014Delilah hugs her knees to her chest, props the pipe on her kneecaps, and flicks the lighter\u2014\u201cthen we won\u2019t even be able to set off fireworks.\u201d She sucks in a breath with her mouth wrapped around the end, then she holds it in before letting it out, and smoke envelops the tent.</p><p>\u201cWere we going to anyway?\u201d I ask as I brush the tangles from my hair. I\u2019m trying my best to clean up, since I haven\u2019t had a shower since we got here. My hair is gross and tangled, my skin feels really grimy, like each of my pores is stuffed with dirt, and I stink.</p><p>She gapes at me as she hands me the pipe. \u201cUh, yeah.\u201d She lets her auburn hair out of the clip and her hair falls to her shoulders. She snatches the brush from my hand, grinning, and starts to brush her own hair.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I protest, snatching the brush from her. \u201cI was using that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but what were we always saying back at college?\u201d she asks and waggles her eyebrows at me. \u201cWhat\u2019s yours is mine and what\u2019s mine is mine.\u201d</p><p>I stick out my tongue as I robotically position the pipe to my mouth. It\u2019s becoming a routine that I\u2019m still trying to figure out if I need. \u201cOnly because you\u2019re greedy.\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes, laughing. \u201cWhatever, bitch. I\u2019m so nice and that\u2019s why you love me.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but smile as I light the weed, and once it\u2019s kindling I suck in a toxic hit. I wince as it hits the back of my throat and then cough, letting it out. I hand her the pipe and reach for my bag to take out my deodorant. \u201cYep, you caught me.\u201d</p><p>She drops the brush on my lap, sets the pipe down by her feet, and starts making a braid at the back of her head. \u201cI have to say this and I don\u2019t want you to get mad or anything, but you... you look happy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy would I get mad at that?\u201d I ask, putting the deodorant on. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019re calling me a bitch or anything... Well, I guess you kind of did, but so what? I\u2019m happy. That\u2019s not bad, is it?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head and slides the elastic off her wrist. \u201cNo, it\u2019s good, but like I\u2019ve said a couple of times, sometimes it feels like you\u2019re trying to be sad.\u201d</p><p>I take in what she said as I put the cap back on the deodorant. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not now, so...\u201d</p><p>She secures the elastic around the end of her braid. \u201cSo, is the reason why you\u2019re not trying to be sad, because of this?\u201d She points a finger at the pipe. \u201cOr because of a certain someone who likes to draw and who has a freaking hot-as-hell body? Because if it is, I have to say again that I don\u2019t think you should act on it. He\u2019s not boyfriend material.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI never said I was looking for a boyfriend.\u201d I take my perfume out from my bag and flick the cap off. \u201cAnd when did you see his body?\u201d</p><p>She giggles under breath. \u201cI kind of accidentally walked in on him while he was changing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy were you walking into his tent at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d She tenses. \u201cBecause I was confused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know...\u201d She drifts off, letting the braid fall down her back, then she straightens her legs out and slaps her hands on top of her thighs. \u201cHey, you know what I should do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me why you were in Quinton\u2019s tent?\u201d I say in a sarcastic tone. \u201cWas it to try and get him to kiss you again?\"</p><p>\u201cNo, silly.\u201d She slaps the top of my leg. \u201cThat\u2019s not even important. I was only messing around when I did that.\u201d</p><p>I spritz myself with perfume, trying to cover up the stench I know has to be flowing from me. \u201cThen what should you do?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes stray to the veil of rain outside and the mud splattering the ground like wet paint. \u201cActually, it\u2019s a we thing. We should go out and play.\u201d A lazy grin spreads across her face as she glances at me.</p><p>I drop my bottle of perfume in my bag. \u201cAre you crazy? I\u2019m already filthy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen what does it matter if you get a little bit dirtier?\u201d she asks, collecting her pipe from off the tent floor. She takes a few more hits and then pushes it at me.</p><p>I take it because it\u2019s there and I don\u2019t really want to say no. I take a few more inhales of it, and the more the smoke enters my lungs, the more warmed up I get to the idea of what she said.</p><p>My eyes start to water as I think about what my dad would say if he were here, besides the fact that he\u2019d probably be disappointed in me. He always loved to play in the rain.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to play in the rain,\u201d he said once when I was younger.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Daddy?\u201d I\u2019d asked, looking up at him. \u201cWon\u2019t we get all muddy?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and took my hand as he headed for the door. It was pouring down outside, making a muddy mess of the grass. \u201cThat\u2019s the point, Nova. To let go and have fun.\u201d He opened the door, and raindrops fluttered into the house. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s more peaceful when it\u2019s raining. It means everyone else is inside and you get the whole world to yourself.\u201d He winked at me and I\u2019d laughed, then we\u2019d sprinted out into the rainstorm, dancing and jumping in puddles until our clothes were soaked and our cheeks hurt from laughing.</p><p>God, how simple life used to be. I want it to be simple again.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say to Delilah. \u201cLet\u2019s go play in the rain.\u201d</p> <p>Her smile broadens. We take a few more turns with the pipe, because it\u2019s there and it makes the idea of running out into the rain easier. By the time she snatches my hand, my thoughts and feet are moving really slow. She laughs as she jumps out and runs out of the tent, dragging me along with her. The first contact of rain against my skin sends an icy shiver through my body, but as the mud splashes up on my bare legs I bask in the freeness.</p><p>We sprint out of the tent area and dive into the madness going on in the field, where people are covered in mud, sitting in it, dancing in it, throwing it at each other. As I sink into the mud up to my ankles, I slip my fingers from Delilah\u2019s hand and span my hands out to my sides. Laughing, I tip my head back and shut my eyes, whirling in a circle, pretending that no one else is here with me, that I\u2019m completely sober and calm, and that the whole world is mine.</p><p>For a moment, life feels perfect.</p><p>Rain trickles across my face and my hair gets drenched, along with my shirt, but it\u2019s worth it because it\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve felt this free: free from worrying, counting, trying to keep things together and fix things that I know I can\u2019t fix.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you two doing?\u201d I hear Quinton\u2019s voice and I lift my eyelids open.</p><p>He\u2019s standing at the edge of the field with Tristan and Dylan behind him, their hair and clothes soaked from the rain. Dylan looks annoyed, arms crossed, jaw set tight, Tristan is distracted with his phone, and Quinton appears utterly fascinated with the scene.</p><p>Delilah stumbles up beside me and her fingers wrap around my arm. \u201cPlaying,\u201d she calls out to them and then shoves me back.</p><p>I trip over my own feet and fall into the mud right on my ass. They laugh at me and so does Delilah, so I grab her leg and jerk on it, causing her to fall down, too. She lands on her hands and knees and laughs so hard she gasps for air. I laugh, too, then wipe some mud on the side of her face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a terrible friend,\u201d I say, as we slide around in the mud.</p><p>She rolls her eyes trying to wipe the mud off her face, but she only makes a bigger mess. \u201cOh yeah, the worst.\u201d</p><p>She smiles at me and I smile back. We start to laugh, then throw mud at each other. After we stop, she springs to her feet, doing a little twirl before sprinting across the field. She runs right at Dylan, who shakes his head, glaring at her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you fucking dare,\u201d he warns, backing away.</p><p>But she keeps running at him, and when she reaches him, she wraps her arms around him, getting mud all over his shirt and jeans.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck, Delilah,\u201d he curses and shoves her back, kind of roughly, and just like that the rain and the moment of magic it brought disappears as she lands on the ground hard.</p><p>I start to hike through the mud toward her as Dylan rushes off, cussing. Delilah jumps to her feet, and she\u2019s crying as she chases after him. I want to scream at her for being an idiot and to leave him alone, but I can barely get my legs to move, so all I do is stand there.</p><p>Tristan roams off toward the truck area. Quinton waits for me at the border of the field where it shifts to grass, making it is less muddy. He has shorts on and his shirt off, and his skin is wet and gorgeous and all I want to do is touch him.</p><p>When I reach the edge of the mud, he extends his hand out to me. \u201cGod, I leave you alone for ten minutes and all hell breaks loose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been gone for more than ten minutes,\u201d I say, taking his hand. He helps me out of the mud, trying not to laugh at my appearance. \u201cI got bored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a nice look for you,\u201d he comments, and I can tell he\u2019s trying really hard not to laugh at me. The rain is slowing down and the mud on my skin, clothes, and hair is starting to dry out and become crusty. He runs his eyes over me, stopping on my eyes. \u201cAre you high?\u201d he asks, and when I don\u2019t answer, he frowns. \u201cNova, you\u2019re too good\u2014\u201d</p><p>I cover his mouth with my hand, because I don\u2019t want to hear it, just like I never wanted to hear it from Landon. Not only because the similarity of their words makes my heart feel like it\u2019s rupturing open, but because right now I\u2019m not too good for anything, stuck in the subdued state of being high. I\u2019m just me. Nova. Good and bad. \u201cDon\u2019t say it.\u201d</p><p>He keeps frowning as I lower my hand and I start running my fingers through my hair, plucking out the chunks of mud. Quinton begins wiping off my legs, but we only cause the mud to smear everywhere, and by the time I\u2019m done I look like the monster from Swamp Thing.</p><p>Finally, he pulls his hands away and stands up straight, letting out a sigh. \u201cI think you\u2019re shit out of luck, Nova. It\u2019s not coming off.\u201d</p><p>I frown as I pick a large chunk of mud out of my leather bands. \u201cIt has to come off.\u201d</p><p>He snorts a laugh and I stick out my tongue, tossing the chunk of mud at him. It hits him square in the forehead and he picks it off, frowning. I pull a whoops face, and I start to back away as fake aggravation crosses his face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so going to pay for that,\u201d he says, matching my steps as I speed for the mud pit, because I know I\u2019m safe there.</p><p>I reel around to run, but he snags the back of my shirt and pulls me toward him. I thrust my hands out, putting all my weight forward, trying to get away, as my shirt stretches. But he maintains his hold on me until I get close enough to him, then he encloses me in his arms, picks me up, and heads toward the field.</p><p>\u201cQuinton, don\u2019t,\u201d I halfheartedly protest, because I\u2019m already muddy and it doesn\u2019t really matter if he throws me back in it.</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d he says, constricting his hold. \u201cYou don\u2019t get away with throwing mud on me.\u201d He wades a little into the mud, then drops me on the ground right on my butt.</p><p>I roll onto my back, and mud oozes all over my skin, hair, and clothes as I sink into the ground. \u201cYou\u2019re mean.\u201d</p><p>He grins at me, placing his hands on his hips as he stares down at me, looking pleased with himself. \u201cAnd you\u2019re a mess.\u201d</p><p>I stick out my tongue and then spit when I get a mouthful of mud. He laughs, hunching over and clutching at his gut, like he thinks I\u2019m a freaking comedian, and suddenly lying in the dirt becomes worth it.</p><p>I stick out my hand. \u201cThis is getting gross. Can you help me up?\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head, he smiles and slips his fingers through mine. I give him no time to react as I tug down hard on his arm. His knees give out, and he collapses into the mud right on top of me. His hands spring out and he catches himself before he squishes me. Mud covers him as he hovers over me, supporting his weight with his arms.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you fell for that,\u201d I say, smearing my muddy hand across his forehead just because I can.</p><p>He brings one of his hands up and rubs it all over my face while I squirm and laugh. \u201cI blame it on those beautiful eyes of yours. They make you look like a trusting person.\u201d</p><p>I hold my breath inside my chest, part of me wanting to fully hear, see, and feel the moment and fight against the high, yet part of me wants to embrace it and not feel anything at all. The rain softly trickles down on us, and my skin is wet and muddy. In the distance the band is playing an acoustic song. There are people everywhere, and mud flies through the air. My heart beats in my chest like a tiny drum that wants to play a song so goddamn badly it hurts, and maybe I finally will. Maybe I\u2019ll really make good on my promise and pick up a set of drumsticks again and play for Quinton like I told him I would.</p><p>Quinton\u2019s beautiful honey-brown eyes are on me, the ones that first drew me to him, as rain beads his skin, lips, jawline. I want to kiss him, and he must want to kiss me, too, because he start to lean down as I sit up and we meet halfway, colliding together at the precise moment that lightning snaps and thunder booms. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The rain picks up again as our bodies and tongues melt together and water soaks through our clothes. Everything seems to move in slow motion as I trail my fingers up his bare, lean chest, while he runs a hand through my hair, tugging softly at the roots. Heat flows off us, and mud is getting everywhere. He traces his tongue along the roof of my mouth, and when he slips it out I bite down on my lip. He lets out a groan as his weight lowers and my arms get pinned between our chests. I wiggle them out as our mouths stay attached, our breaths mingling together, and I circle them around his neck and pull him even closer, despite the fact that we\u2019re sinking into the mud. I sketch lines up and down his spine, feeling the smoothness of his skin, and I hold on to him, because I don\u2019t want to lose him.</p><p>I begin to kiss him frantically the more time goes on because my thoughts are getting mixed together and nothing makes sense at the moment. I can\u2019t see any kind of future, and I have no idea what\u2019s going to happen in the next thirty seconds. I try to count to calm myself down, but I\u2019m too far gone to make it past five and the idea is frightening me. The silence the weed has been instilling in me has suddenly become too silent.</p><p>\u201cNova,\u201d he groans against my mouth as I dig my fingers into his back. \u201cNova, slow down.\u201d</p><p>I start gasping for air, my nails plunging deeper into his skin, and my lungs feel like they\u2019re burning. Then he\u2019s pulling away and I think he\u2019s going to leave, but instead he grabs my hand and helps me stand up.</p> <p>He leads us across the field and through the tent area and I think he\u2019s going to stop at our tent, but instead he curves to the right and continues walking, heading toward the line of trees.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d I say through the chattering of my teeth. My hair and clothes are drenched, and my skin is covered with flaky mud that makes my skin feel tight. I have no idea where he\u2019s taking me, and it feels like I should be counting my steps and trying to turn back to the tent, but I can\u2019t seem to find the pattern of the steps I\u2019m taking, or the willpower to let go of his hand, so I keep following him helplessly through the tall grass.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking you somewhere where you can wash off,\u201d he says, staring ahead as he walks determinedly through the tall grass. \u201cAnd to give you a break so that maybe you can get your mind in the right place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, you\u2019re not taking me to the nudist colony place, are you?\u201d I start to pull back, but then I stop because it doesn\u2019t seem as scary anymore.</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d His shorts are covered in mud and his hair has flecks in it. On his back are muddy handprints and streaks of mud from where I touched him, along with small crescent cuts on his shoulder blade.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I stabbed you with my nails,\u201d I say as we wind around a rock and dip into the trees. The thick branches above our heads block out the remaining rain and grey clouds but there\u2019s a current falling off them so we still get wet.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d He reaches around to his back, touching the scratches. \u201cBut Nova... how much did you smoke?\u201d</p><p>I shrug, because I surprisingly lost count, and he sighs, letting his hand fall to the side. We don\u2019t say anything else until we reach a river flowing among the lofty pine trees. We pause at the edge, and Quinton glances around for a way across it.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this place?\u201d I ask, glancing up at the gray sky peeking through the branches.</p><p>\u201cI found it while I was wandering around trying to find a place to clean off without giving everyone a show,\u201d he says, winding around me and hiking toward a large rock near the edge of the stream.</p><p>The water gently flows over it, but it acts as a stepping stone, and without warning Quinton grips my waist and lifts me onto it. Once my feet are planted on the rock, he lets me go and then jumps onto the rock himself. He stands up straight and takes my hand, then leads me over to the other side of the rock. There\u2019s a little bit of a gap between the rock and the shoreline, and Quinton hops down, landing in the river, his shoes getting wet. He stands in the water and reaches for me. When I crouch down, his fingers spread around my hips, and he carefully lowers me to him. Then he wades over to the shore, pretty much carrying me in his arms so my feet don\u2019t get wet.</p> <p>Once we\u2019re both on the shore, he threads his fingers through mine, and I let him guide me deeper into the trees as rain drips down on my head and down my arms. We keep hiking through the forest, and the farther we go the more I start to calm down. By the time we reach an area where the trees open up, I\u2019m mad at myself because I\u2019m so tired of doing things and having no direction and being confused all the time. I just want to be Nova, or at least find out who the real Nova is.</p><p>When we stop, we\u2019re standing on a rocky shore that stretches out to a glistening pond. The river flows into it over the towering rocks in front of us, and the entire area is almost completely encompassed by enormous, jagged rocks, and flourishing trees. \u201cI give you a private place to clean off.\u201d He smiles, motioning at the water.</p><p>I remove my fingers from his grip and walk up to the water peering down in. \u201cYou just found this by accident?\u201d</p><p>He nods, stepping up beside me with his head tipped down so he can examine my eyes. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>I rub my eyes. \u201cA lot better, actually, but a little tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look a lot better,\u201d he says. \u201cI figured the walk here would calm you down and then you could clean off. And when we\u2019re done, I\u2019ll take you back and you can get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>I rub my eyes again. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He starts to unbutton his shorts. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t think he gets my whole meaning. I\u2019m not just saying thanks for pulling me away; I\u2019m saying thanks for letting me calm down, for letting me breathe, and for telling me that I shouldn\u2019t be doing the things that I do.</p><p>He slips his shorts off and my gaze instantly goes to his boxers, my heart beating deafeningly inside my chest. Even though I\u2019m a little out of it, I can feel my cheeks heating, because I\u2019m pretty much staring at his manly parts.</p><p>But he gives me no time to get too embarrassed as he takes off toward a section of cliffy rocks at the side of the pond and he climbs up to the top of the highest one of them. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d he calls out as he stands on the edge, staring down at the water. \u201cCannonball or swan dive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelly flop,\u201d I say, and he shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cNo fucking way. Do you know how bad that would hurt?\u201d He turns around and does a backflip right off the edge, his head coming so close to hitting the edge of the rock that I gasp.</p><p>He makes it into the water, though, and launches a splash into the air. Seconds later, he bursts through the surface again, running his hand over his head, slicking his hair back. \u201cYour turn,\u201d he says, paddling his arms as he floats farther out into the water.</p><p>I glance down at my muddy clothes, nervous about stripping down in front of him. When I glance up at him again, though, he has his back turned to me, staring up at the rocky cliffs at the far side of the pool.</p><p>I seize the opportunity to drop my shorts and pull my shirt off. My bra and panties are covered with mud, too, but I can rinse them off in the water. I walk up to the shoreline and stick my toe in, shivering from the cold temperature.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You\u2019re not going to jump in?\u201d he asks. When I look up at him he\u2019s looking at me, and I mean really looking at me, his honey-brown eyes skimming my body. I think about ducking behind a bush, but then what\u2019d be the point? He\u2019s already seen me, and I can\u2019t erase that from his head.</p><p>I hike up to the rocks and hoist myself up on the tallest one. I stand on the edge and then shut my eyes. Summoning a deep breath, I jump up and cannonball off the side, falling and falling and falling. When I hit the water, a chill disperses through my body, and I quickly paddle my way to the top, breaking through the surface. I take a deep breath, wiping my eyes off and blinking against the water droplets dripping down my forehead.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty fucking cold, right?\u201d Quinton asks, floating over to me as I smooth my hair out of my eyes.</p><p>I nod, tipping my head back into the water. \u201cA little warning would have been nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but then you would have probably backed out and not jumped in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re probably right. It\u2019s probably a good thing you didn\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p><p>We grow quiet as we float around in the water with our arms out to the side, listening to the river water falling off the rocks. The clouds start to break apart in the sky and I detect a tiny bit of sunlight streaming in.</p><p>\u201cI seriously want to draw this place,\u201d Quinton divulges, looking around at the rocks and the trees.</p><p>\u201cYou could, still,\u201d I say. \u201cWe still have a couple more days left here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah... maybe.\u201d He tears his eyes of the rocks and focuses on me. \u201cNova... I have to know, do you really want to be with me, because sometimes it seems like you do and sometimes it seems like you don\u2019t, and I don\u2019t want to add to your confusion.\u201d He moves his arms in a circular motion, swimming backward and putting space between us. \u201cIn fact, I think I should probably back off... I like you and everything, but I think I should back off.\u201d He repeats himself at the end like he\u2019s trying to convince himself more than me.</p><p>I use my arms to turn in a circle, gazing up at the clearing sky. \u201cI\u2019m confused...,\u201d I mutter. I\u2019m not sure if he hears me, but it\u2019s the realest thing I\u2019ve ever said. I stop spinning and float in front of him. \u201cAbout everything. Not just you, but life. And I want you to back off, but I don\u2019t at the same time.\u201d</p><p>His breathing becomes ragged as he stares at me and his pupils shrink as I tilt my head back and smooth my hair down with my hands again, my chest and bra rising up over the water. When I sink back down under the water, he starts to swim at me and seconds later his lips crash against mine as his arms encircle my waist. My arms link around his neck in response and my mouth opens up to his tongue as he slips it inside, devouring me with a deep wet kiss. Our bodies crush together, and it feels odd because the cold water masks our body heat, almost like neither of us really exists, and this moment isn\u2019t really happening, which makes it easier to do things.</p><p>As if my legs have a mind of their own, I wrap them around his waist, and he\u2019s supporting both of our weight as he swims one-handed, moving us toward the shore until my back collides with the sandpaper edges of the rock. I feel a little of my skin scrape off, but I don\u2019t care. I press at his back, trying to pull him closer, even though there\u2019s no more room left between us. His mouth consumes mine as he braces a hand on the rock next to my head and his other hand moves across my back. Then with a flick of his fingers, he unhooks my bra. I have no time to react as he jerks it off and tosses it up onto the rocks above our heads. The sensation of my nipples against his chest sends a quiver through my body, and suddenly I\u2019m shivering from his touch and the cold water, desperately seeking heat.</p><p>His hand starts to travel down my back, and I arch into him when he reaches the top of my panties, then he pauses. I know I should tell him to stop\u2014that I\u2019m not in the right state of mind\u2014but not being in the right state of mind makes it harder to say no. And what if I do and then he leaves me and I never see him again? What if I miss the moment again? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I don\u2019t say anything and he continues to slide my panties down my legs and works to get them off my ankles underneath the water. Somehow he manages to do it without losing them in the current swirling around us and then he\u2019s throwing that piece of fabric up there too. Within seconds he takes off his boxers and I have no time to react because everything is happening so quickly. I\u2019m suddenly naked for the first time in front of a guy.</p><p>\u201cNova,\u201d he breathes against my mouth as he cups my cheek with his forehead resting against mine. His eyes are squeezed shut and then he opens them up, and for a fleeting moment he looks like he doesn\u2019t want to this, like he\u2019s torn on what\u2019s right and wrong, real and fake, and I understand completely.</p><p>I don\u2019t say anything as he presses his mouth to mine again, slips his tongue out and parts my lips with it. He groans, shuddering, and I shiver in response. My legs open up to him, and he positions himself between them as he strokes one of my nipples with his finger. When our bodies connect in every place, I can feel the tip of him pressed up between my legs. Part of me wants him to slip inside me, so I can feel what it\u2019s like before I miss my chance again. But the other part of me thinks it\u2019s wrong because we\u2019re in the middle of a pond, with no protection, and I have no idea what I want or who I want. I should know what I want, shouldn\u2019t I? I need to figure stuff out.</p><p>But I can\u2019t seem to get the words to come out because the regret and what-ifs own me, so I let him slip his tip inside me. I immediately wince from the pain, sucking in a sharp breath as every one of my muscles seizes into knots. I feel wrong, along with a million other things, because I\u2019m not sure I want this. In fact, I don\u2019t think I do. Not like this. The truth in my thoughts suddenly opens my eyes and I figure out what to do next. What do I do next?</p> <p>Quinton freezes, goes dead still with the tip of him barely inside me. My chest is heaving from the pain and fear and my thoughts are a blurry stream or numbers, emotions, and distorted thoughts as I try to figure out what to do. Keep going. Stop.</p><p>\u201cNova,\u201d he says in strained, almost pained voice. \u201cIs this... is this...\u201d He opens his eyes, which are filled with more guilt then I\u2019ve ever seen. He sucks in a deep breath. \u201cHave you never done this before?\u201d</p><p>My body is shaking and my teeth are chattering and I can\u2019t seem to get control of my nerves or voice, so I shake my head instead. His whole body goes rigid, and I can feel the beat of his pulse pounding between my legs. He starts breathing so loudly it covers the sound of the water falling from the rocks , but I can\u2019t hear myself breathing at all.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this,\u201d he whispers, and it looks like he\u2019s going to cry as he pulls out of me. He starts to swim away, but I grab him, panicking, fearing I\u2019m going to lose him. Or maybe it\u2019s Landon. I\u2019m so confused. Lost. Always lost.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t go,\u201d I say, but it sounds unreal, just words disconnected from my emotions.</p> <p>He shakes his head, looking horrified. \u201cYou don\u2019t want this Nova... want me. You\u2019re better than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not!\u201d I scream. Actually scream. My eyes go wide, shocked at the anger in my voice, so real and raw. \u201cI\u2019m not better than you. Him. Anyone!\u201d My voice echoes for miles and the water ripples around me as I try to stay afloat. \u201cI don\u2019t even know who I am...\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head again, moving his arms in the water, backing away from me. \u201cNo, you are better. You\u2019re just confused right now for whatever reason. But soon you\u2019re going to open your eyes and see who you really are and that you don\u2019t belong with a bunch of fucking loser drug addicts.\u201d Pain laces his eyes and I can see something inside him, something heavy that I can\u2019t even begin to understand. \u201cYou don\u2019t belong in a pond about ready to screw some guy while you\u2019re fucking high, headed down a road of self-destruction. Because that\u2019s where you\u2019re going to go if you keep going down this road. Trust me. I know.\u201d</p><p>My lips tremble as tears threaten to spill down my cheeks. My head falls down and I stare at my distorted reflection. \u201cI belong here.\u201d But my voice is just a whisper as memories of my past overwhelm me, ones of who I used to be\u2014with Landon. \u201cI belong somewhere...\u201d</p><p>He reaches up over the rock above us and grabs his boxers before swimming to the shore and I don\u2019t try to stop him. I can\u2019t. I\u2019m losing focus on the present as the memories that I try to block take over my mind.</p><p>He gets dressed and then hurries for the trees, leaving me alone in the water, alone. Alone. Alone. Alone. I try to backtrack how I got here, to this lonely place, but I can barely remember the journey and all I want to do is go back to a time in my life when everything felt right and made sense. I want stuff to make sense again. I don\u2019t want to feel so wrong inside.</p> <p>I cover my chest with my arms and start to count the beats of my heart, but it doesn\u2019t do anything for me. I try to count the tree branches, the clouds, the stars as they peek out of the sky. But nothing is helping, and as my emotions start to emerge and chip down the wall I built around that night\u2014around myself\u2014I can no longer shut it down. It rams me in the chest, like a wrecking ball, and nearly drags me under the water. But somehow I manage to heave myself up onto the rocks. Staring at the stars, I grab onto my wrist, pressing my finger to the scar that\u2019s over my erratic pulse, feeling myself falling to that place again. The one where nothing makes sense and the past overtakes me.</p><p>Then I break to pieces, losing control over my thoughts and actions. I can barely understand what\u2019s going on as I try to grasp reality. But panic, sorrow, anger, and remorse take me over and pull me down. I try to count something\u2014the stars, the trees, my heartbeats\u2014but nothing is helping. And in the end, the past catches up with me.</p><p>And I remember. Everything.</p><p>Are you sure you don\u2019t just want to stay over?\u201d Landon asks, as I put my shirt on and sit up on the bed. \u201cWe could just cuddle or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCuddle?\u201d I question, glancing over my shoulder at him, pretending everything\u2019s okay, when really I\u2019m a mess inside. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs innocently. \u201cWhat? I could be a cuddler.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes, stand up, and slip my sandals on. \u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d I start to head to the door. \u201cBesides, what if your parents walk in and catch us?\u201d That\u2019s actually not the real reason I won\u2019t have sex with him. I\u2019m secretly afraid that it\u2019ll hurt too badly or that he won\u2019t like how I look completely naked. Or that I\u2019ll be so bad he\u2019ll never want to touch me again. But I know that soon my excuses are going to run out, and either I\u2019m going to just go through with it or he\u2019ll leave me. And then what? What will be left of me?</p><p>He stands up, slipping his shirt on with a faint smile on his lips. \u201cThey never come in my room after I go to bed, so we can cuddle all we want.\u201d</p> <p>Sighing, I quietly open the door and lower my voice. \u201cI should probably get home.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, he walks up to me and kisses me on the head. \u201cI love you, no matter what,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d I say, on the verge of crying because I really don\u2019t know if he means it. Sometimes it seems like he does and sometimes it doesn\u2019t. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He pulls back a little, looking confused. \u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor not...\u201d I trail off, glancing at his bed. \u201cFor disappointing you again.\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head, he takes my face in his hands and bends down to look me in the eyes. \u201cNova, you have never once disappointed me. I\u2019ll love you no matter what, even if we never have sex.\u201d</p><p>I resisted the urge to roll my eyes at him, because even though I know he may mean it now, there will be a point where he\u2019ll get tired. \u201cI love you,\u201d I whisper and brush my lips across his softly, clutching the bottom of his shirt, afraid to let him go, afraid to admit my fears. Always afraid.</p><p>When I draw back, he gives me a small smile and laces his fingers through mine. \u201cCome on,\u201d he says and heads out of the room, tugging me along with him.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d I ask, rushing to keep up with him as he trots up the steps.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a surprise,\u201d he says and we take lighter, nearly soundless steps as we reach the main floor so his parents won\u2019t hear us.</p><p>We tiptoe across the kitchen, laughing under our breaths when he runs into the kitchen table. Finally we make it to the door, and when we\u2019re both outside and off the porch we start laughing again. But our laughter quiets down as he leads me down the hill in his backyard. When we near the bottom, he stops and glances around at the damp grass below us and the starry sky above our heads. Then he sinks down to the ground, still holding on to my hand, and I sink down next to him.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d I ask, as he lays down on his back.</p><p>\u201cThis way we can sleep together without worrying about getting caught,\u201d he says, letting go of my hand so he can tuck his below his head.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re seriously going to sleep out in the backyard with me?\u201d I ask, lying down beside him.</p><p>\u201cFor a little while,\u201d he says. \u201cBut eventually I\u2019ll have to go back inside.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>Quinton</p><p>I leave her in the pond, naked and chattering, and run back through the trees toward the tent. I\u2019m stunned. Horrified. Hitting a full-on panic attack. She was about to hand me her fucking virginity. Me. A fucking loser, who she\u2019ll probably regret knowing when she moves on from this lost period in her life. And to me, it\u2019ll probably mean something to me\u2014she means something. She means something. The truth stabs at my chest like a chunk of shrapnel lodged in my heart, right where the scar is. Things aren\u2019t supposed to mean anything. I\u2019m dead. I gave up. I\u2019m not supposed to be here. With Nova. With anyone</p><p>The closer I get to the tent, the worse I feel. I know I shouldn\u2019t have left her like that, and it\u2019s one of the hardest fucking things I\u2019ve had to do. Nova is beautiful, interesting, a good person, and she makes me feel things I thought I\u2019d never feel again. On some level I think she understands me, even though I haven\u2019t told her anything about me. She gets pain and loss, and that\u2019s pretty much what exists inside me. I think in a different life I probably could have loved her, been with her, made her happy. But this is this life, and I can\u2019t love anyone or be loved. And that\u2019s the way it will always be\u2014should be.</p><p>Right after the accident happened, some people tried to tell me that it would get easier and that I wouldn\u2019t always feel this way. That time would heal the pain, the guilt, everything that I\u2019m feeling. They\u2019d say it\u2019s not my fault. That I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time and just happened to be behind the wheel. Some people said otherwise, like Ryder\u2019s parents, who insisted that it was my fault and that I should have been driving more safely. They said that I ruined their family, killed their daughter. Lexi\u2019s parents wouldn\u2019t even talk to me or look at me anymore. Some people pretended I didn\u2019t exist, like my father. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In the end, it all comes down to one thing: I was driving too fast. I knew that. And I wasn\u2019t watching the road when I should have been. Lexi saw it first. That the turn was too sharp and I was going too fast. She screamed. I swerved. There was a crunch as we collided with another car. And then just like that, everything that once existed, lives, breaths, heartbeats, were gone. And I was left with blood on my hands.</p><p>Finally, after what seems like hours, I make back to the tent. The muddy field is drying in the sun, shriveling and cracking. I search for Dylan, and when I can\u2019t find him, I look for Tristan. I find him smoking on a tailgate with a group of guys and girls who I\u2019ve never met but he seems to know. When he sees me approaching, he hops off the tailgate, his forehead immediately creasing as he takes in the reckless state I\u2019m in, my eyes bulging, my clothes and hair soaked with water and sweat, shuddering from head to toe with fear, desire, and need.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck\u2019s wrong?\u201d he says with a joint pinched in his finger.</p><p>\u201cI need something hard,\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asks. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Why do you look so upset?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong, and I won\u2019t look upset once I get something hard.\u201d It\u2019s all I need to say. There\u2019s only one thing that matters to druggies, and that\u2019s getting high. Tristan may dither consciously for a second, but when it all comes down to it, drugs always conquer.</p><p>He nods his head at one of the larger tents near the edge of the tent area. \u201cCome on.\u201d He hands the joint to some girl with long, wavy black hair and crooked teeth. Her breasts are popping out of her black sleeveless dress and she\u2019s looking me over, her mouth salivating to get a taste. I think later, when I\u2019m numb. But Nova\u2019s blue eyes and freckled face overlap the thought, and guilt creeps inside me. I tell my guilt to shut the fuck up. Because I\u2019m already guilty of a lot of other terrible things, worse than hooking up with some random girl.</p><p>\u201cHurry,\u201d I tell Tristan, my mind wanting, seeking, needing solitude. Now.</p><p>He nods, and I practically make him run toward the tent. When we reach it, we duck right in as if we both belong there. And we do. I do.</p> <p>There are these greasy, cracked-out-looking guys inside and a girl with her top off, smoking what looks like a joint in the corner. But I know it\u2019s not a joint by the dazed look on her face. She\u2019s gone. Hollowed out by the toxic smoke. Whoever she was before all of this only exists in a locked box inside her head, and she probably can\u2019t even remember how to get it open. This place doesn\u2019t even exist to her, and I want to be where she is because I don\u2019t want to feel it anymore, everything that comes with living after everything is lost. I want to leave. I want to escape.</p><p>Really, what I want to do is die.</p><p>\u201cWe need a hit,\u201d Tristan tells a guy with a ponytail sitting in the middle of the tent with his shirt unbuttoned and his shoes off. He hands him some money and I keep staring at the girl, watching her drift further and further away from reality, right where I want to be. Gone. Gone. Gone.</p><p>Nonexistent.</p><p>When she turns her head in my direction, she smiles, but there\u2019s nothing behind it and I\u2019m envious of her. I want what she has. I want.</p><p>Nothing.</p> <p>The guy takes the money from Tristan and then takes the joint from the girl, who groggily rolls on her side, her arms flopped out in front of her. She keeps blinking her eyes, until there\u2019s nothing left but large massive pupils that are glazed over and bare.</p><p>Empty.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the best around,\u201d the guy says, handing it to Tristan, like it matters, like if it wasn\u2019t we\u2019d take our money back and go somewhere else.</p><p>Tristan nods and puts the joint to his lips. Taking a long hit, his pupils instantly dilate, his breathing quiets and evens out, and he relaxes back on his elbows, handing the joint to me. I don\u2019t give myself time to think, because thinking leads me to places I don\u2019t belong. And where I belong is here.</p><p>My hands shake uncontrollably as I put up to my lips, suck in a breath, as everyone in the tent lies down on the floor, some moving their hands above their hands and others not moving at all. Then smoke crashes into my lungs, saturates, and completely sucks out the good in me, and suddenly everything stops.</p><p>Dies.</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>Nova</p> <p>I cry until my eyes are swollen shut, remaining there for hours, and then somehow I manage to get my clothes on and climb down the rocks. Nighttime has arrived, the sky pitch-black, and the only thing I have to lead the way is the sound of the music and shouting and the small amount of stage light making it through the trees. I try not to think about how he left me like that, but it\u2019s all I can think about. He left me. Landon left me. Quinton left me. My dad left me. Even I left me, in a sense.</p><p>It feels like I\u2019m never going to make it through the trees, and I\u2019m not even sure if I want to. Maybe I\u2019ll just lay down in the dark and stay perfectly still. When I stumble over a rock and fall to the ground, I can\u2019t seem to get up. I lie in the dirt, staring up at the night sky, counting the stars that form the constellation Cassiopeia, trying to settle myself down. But nothing is helping. Nothing. And I feel the memory prickling up against my mind, like rusty, bent, and crooked nails.</p><p>His skin looks like snow and his eyes are open, like he\u2019s looking at something, like he\u2019s still there, but the lights have turned off inside his eyes. I fall to the ground, wanting to forget everything, wanting to forget that Landon is hanging from the ceiling and that he\u2019s written the word good-bye on the wall and that I don\u2019t even know who he was writing to. I want to forget this moment, but how can I forget it? It\u2019s not real. How could it be? Because he can\u2019t be dead. It\u2019s impossible. He wouldn\u2019t leave me. He loved me.</p><p>Knowing that what I\u2019m seeing has to be wrong, I get to my feet and my foot is bleeding and my heart is thrashing in my chest. I\u2019m losing control and my thoughts pile up in my head like bricks upon bricks upon bricks like they\u2019re building a wall around my mind, only the wall is crooked and split...</p><p>I get up from the ground and run, trying to get away from the memory, the bushes and branches slicing my palms open, and I try to keep track of my footsteps, how many I\u2019m taking, where I\u2019m going, but the memory catches up with me anyway...</p><p>I climb onto his bed, my hands shaking as I reach for the rope, because I know that if I can get him down, he\u2019ll be okay. He has to be okay. Because I can\u2019t picture my life without him. Without him I am nothing. I have no one. Nothing. Everything that makes me me belongs to Landon, and without him I\u2019m nothing but a shadow of a person with no substance. And I can\u2019t be a shadow.</p><p>I lean over the side, extending my arm as far as it will go until my fingers brush the coarse rope, and dig my nails into the knot, trying to loosen it. My fingers are trembling and my heart is as unsteady as my thoughts, like nothing inside me will connect. My arm keeps brushing his skin, and he feels so cold and unreal, and it doesn\u2019t make any sense because the Landon I know is warm and thriving, breathing, has a pulse. This isn\u2019t him. It can\u2019t be.</p><p>I\u2019ve lost all control, and I can barely acknowledge what I\u2019m doing. What I\u2019m seeing. And this stupid song is playing in the background over and over again and the lyrics and sound are embedding into my head. I want it out. Because I don\u2019t need to remember this. It\u2019s not real. It can\u2019t be.</p><p>It can\u2019t be.</p><p>The knot is too tight, and my fingers scrape open and bleed all over the threads of the rope, my hands, some even drips down my arm. But I keep trying, refusing to give up, because he\u2019s not gone. He just needs help. He wouldn\u2019t leave me. He loves me...</p><p>I stumble into the field and run across it, the dewy grass hissing at my legs and my bare feet scuff up dirt. I forgot to put on my shoes. I need to go back. No, I need to keep going forward. I need to keep running, moving, breathing.</p><p>I need to keep holding on to Landon.</p><p>I keep working on the rope until my arms grow tired and I can\u2019t feel my fingers or my heart\u2014or anything. I lose track of time and where I am, and suddenly the sun is blinding and I realize that time is still moving, catching up with me as Landon\u2019s mom walks in and starts crying and screaming hysterically. Moments later his body comes down, and more hysteria builds. She manages to call an ambulance, and eventually the paramedics and police show up. They start asking me all these questions, and everyone is crying and watching as they examine me and dope me up on sedatives. But I can\u2019t say anything, because I can\u2019t remember\u2014won\u2019t remember. How could I when I don\u2019t even know who I am anymore? The Nova I was is dead.</p><p>I stumble onto the tent area, dodging around the people, and pushing my way through the crowd. Everyone is staring at me and there are so many people. Some laugh at me, others step away, there are a few guys that grab at me, telling me profane things while they cop a feel. I hit at them, shout, but this only seems to encourage them, and for a second I can feel them dragging me down and I realize how alone I really am. That no one around here cares. That I\u2019m just another lost soul that\u2019s lost her way, only I\u2019m suddenly wanting to find my way back.</p><p>\u201cNova, no matter what happens, you\u2019ll never be alone in this world,\u201d my dad had said to me once. I\u2019d gone through a weird phase where I wore different-colored socks and refused to comb my hair and no one wanted to be my friend. \u201cYou\u2019ll always have your mother and me.\u201d</p><p>But I\u2019m alone now. By choice.</p><p>A guy grabs my ass and prods his fingers into my arm, saying, \u201cHey, sweetheart, slow down and try to relax. Don\u2019t be in such a hurry. Have some fun. I can show you some fun.\u201d He starts to jerk me forward, toward the people flocking to the stage, and so many people look out of it that I doubt that anyone will hear me if I scream. He keeps dragging me further into the darkness and I know if I keep going, things are going to end up bad. I knee him in the thigh and then stab my nails into his skin.</p><p>\u201cLet me go!\u201d I scream. He staggers back, his feet scuffing the dirt as he comes back at me, looking pissed off, and he slaps me across the face hard. I choke on the impact and the blinding pain radiating across my cheek as I cup my face with my hand.</p><p>The guy swings his arm around to hit me again, but I run. I run and run and run, even when my legs feel like there disconnecting from my body. Then I spot the purple tent. Delilah and Dylan are in front of it and they say something to me, but I have no idea what and I don\u2019t care. I run straight for my tent and collapse onto the sleeping bag, clutching my head as tears burn my eyes and streak my cheeks.</p><p>I want it out of my head. This moment. Every moment. I want it gone. I want to be gone. From the life I fell into. This place. But how the hell can I escape it when I can\u2019t even remember getting here? It\u2019s like I\u2019ve lost track of the last year or maybe all the years. I want to go back when skipping in the rain was fun and all it took was ice cream to make me happy.</p><p>I just want simplicity. Direction. Understanding.</p><p>I want... I don\u2019t even know what I want. My head starts to race as I realize the painful truth of the revelation. I am lost. Broken. Searching for something that doesn\u2019t exist. What Landon did may never make sense because he\u2019s the only one who truly understands why he did it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And he\u2019s gone. He\u2019s really, really gone. The rope was around his neck and he put it there and I couldn\u2019t save him. No matter what I do, nothing will change that. Not counting. Not making videos. Not getting high. Not wandering meaninglessly though life.</p><p>He\u2019s gone.</p><p>My mind continues to race until the anger, rage, pain, confusion, love, heartbreak\u2014every piece of him and me builds up inside my chest like shards of jagged glass, cutting me from the inside. When I can\u2019t take the pain anymore, I open my mouth and let out an uncontrollable scream as I reach for my phone.</p><p>My fingers tremble as I turn it on and unlock the screen. Loud voices blare around outside along with the unbearably deafening sound of the music. My heart is thrashing inside my chest as my mind searches for numbers and control, but there\u2019s so much noise and I can\u2019t think straight. Everything around me and inside me is a mess, unstable, erratic like my pulse and my breathing. I can\u2019t think straight.</p> <p>Then I click open the file, and with a faltering breath I hit Play. Seconds later the video clicks on and then everything becomes silent.</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>Nova</p><p>The song plays in the background, the one he had playing when I found him that day. The camera is angled crookedly, so his honey-brown eyes look like shadows; his inky black hair hangs over his forehead and only conceals his eyes more. I can barely note the pain in them, but it\u2019s there and it\u2019s radiating in his voice, more than I\u2019ve ever heard.</p><p>The moonlight trickles through the window in the background, his skin hauntingly white, but in the most amazing way. He\u2019s beautiful sitting in front of the screen, like he sketched it himself, his final portrait. The heart-wrenching lyrics playing through the speakers only amplify the finality in the scene.</p> <p>I hold my breath as I wait for him to say or do something, speak, or move, but he\u2019s still as a statue, staring at the screen, like he\u2019s trying to decipher me instead of me deciphering him. He\u2019s eerily calm, like he\u2019s sedated, and maybe he is. It\u2019s to dark to see if his eyes are bloodshot, and I\u2019m not there to smell him. I wish I was, though. God, I wish I was.</p><p>Finally, he takes a breath. \u201cI\u2019m not sure who will watch this... whether anyone will or if it will be put away with the rest of my things... boxed up... shuffled away... forgotten.\u201d He shifts his weight in the chair, crossing his arms on the desk. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if I actually want anyone to watch it, either. I\u2019m conflicted, like I am with everything else in my life.\u201d He pauses, and I can hear him breathing. I almost expect him to cry with how much repressed sadness is flowing out of him, but his eyes look like the stay dry. \u201cI really did try. I promise I did... but I just couldn\u2019t do it anymore. The days... they just became too hard... waking up became too hard... I couldn\u2019t even numb the heaviness in me anymore... Not even with drugs...\u201d He rakes his fingers through his hair, his breath trembling. \u201cLife\u2019s just too heavy. Walking around, breathing, functioning, when I can\u2019t even find a point of doing it.\u201d He drops his hand on the desk. \u201cThere\u2019s just no point.\u201d</p><p>He drags his hand down his face, glancing around at his room, then he reaches over and turns the music down, but I can still hear it quietly haunting the background. \u201cIt feels like I\u2019m living in this hole... this dark hole in the ground, and all I can do is stare at the same damn dirt walls every single day. And there\u2019s no point to it, but I have to do it because there\u2019s nothing else I can do.\u201d He inhales and then stridently exhales. \u201cAnd then there\u2019s all this pain inside of me and I can\u2019t figure out how to turn it off. I keep waiting for it to turn off, but it just keeps getting worse... Everything does... God, I can\u2019t even remember the last time I fucking smiled for real.\u201d He shakes his head, muttering under his breath. \u201cAnd Mom, if you do watch this, I know what you\u2019re thinking. You\u2019re blaming yourself because that\u2019s the kind of person that you are, but it\u2019s not your fault. My head is just seriously fucked up.\u201d</p><p>He taps his fingers nervously on the desk, studying the screen. \u201cI really don\u2019t want to be here. I think about it every single day, the idea that maybe something will happen and I won\u2019t wake up and have to deal with the same goddamn weighted routine of my life, but it just never happens and I just keep walking around, lost. All the fucking time. There\u2019s nothing there inside me. And I just feel like I\u2019m dragging everything\u2014everyone\u2014down around me, because I can\u2019t get past it. I can\u2019t find the will to smile and walk through life, pretending to be content with the heaviness on my shoulder, living in the same dark, goddamn hole forever.\u201d</p><p>He sucks in a deep breath and his voice drops to a soft, barely audible whisper. \u201cNova... beautiful, amazingly... wonderful... Nova. The one thing that was good in my life.... I know you\u2019re going to watch this eventually, because that\u2019s the kind of person you are. You\u2019re strong... your dad died and you moved on, and me... I haven\u2019t even gone through anything that tragic and I\u2019ve barely been hanging on for years.\u201d He pauses his voice dropping even softer. \u201cI love you. I really fucking do, even though I didn\u2019t want to. I didn\u2019t want to drag you into this mess, but I wasn\u2019t strong enough to stay away from you... I got too caught up in your smile, your kindness, the sound of your voice and your passion about life. Everything you did...\u201d A small, distorted smile fleetingly reveals at his lips. \u201cFrom playing the drums to knowing who you are... knowing what you want... It was amazing to watch everything you did with some freedom.... You just did stuff and never overthought it. There\u2019s so much good in you... and it was the one thing that made living life just a little bit easier...\u201d</p><p>He trails off and stares at the camera for the longest time. The song ends and then starts up again, playing on Repeat, and I can feel it in my heart, the moment where he\u2019s going to say his final words and then click off the camera. Leaving. Going. Dying. Giving up. He takes a deep breath and another, then reaches for the screen.</p> <p>\u201cPlease just forgive me,\u201d he says. \u201cI know you can... stay strong... move on... Please, please, forgive me.\u201d</p><p>Then the screen goes black.</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>July 31, Day 73 of Summer Break</p><p>Nova</p><p>I\u2019m not even sure how long I cry for. It feels like forever, but when I finally close my eyes, it\u2019s still dark outside. I surprisingly don\u2019t dream, at least nothing that I can remember, and I wake up in the morning with a splitting headache, puffy eyes, and swollen cheeks. But strangely the weight on my chest, the one I\u2019ve been carrying since Landon left me, feels a tiny bit lighter. His last words echo my head. Please forgive me. I hadn\u2019t even thought about it before. Not in those terms. Forgiving him. And how can I? How can I forgive him for leaving me? I\u2019m not sure, but the Nova he described in the video sounded like she would. The good one, the one that smiled and was able to hang on even after her dad died. But this one, the Nova I am right now, can\u2019t hang on to anything.</p><p>An overwhelming homesick feeling wells up in the pit of my stomach, not just for my mom but also for my dad. He\u2019d be so disappointed if he saw me now, and honestly, I feel kind of ashamed of myself. And so would Landon. Nothing about this place is making me happy, not even the music playing outside or the people I came here with.</p><p>I slept alone in the tent last night and I was angry, because Quinton just left me and I haven\u2019t seen him since. But I\u2019m also relieved, because it allowed me time to cry alone. Not just over Landon, or the video, but over what I\u2019ve become. I\u2019ve been so afraid of everything. Afraid of living life without Landon. Afraid of moving on. Afraid to lose control, ever since that night, that I\u2019ve made my whole life about controlling things and counting, yet I never had control, just an illusion of it. I\u2019d used numbers and order to cover up everything in life, give myself a fake sense of stability, and not fully accept that Landon is gone and I\u2019m going to have to move on without him. And not admitting the real problems out loud has broken me into fragments of a person that once use to be a good person, but now she\u2019s scattered all over the place. I\u2019m sitting in a place that I don\u2019t understand and I don\u2019t think I ever really wanted to be here. I just fell into it and it only took me 73 days, 1,752 hours, 105,120 minutes to get here.</p> <p>I smell like a Dumpster, my clothes are still muddy and stiff, and I shower dry dirt to the floor every time I shift my weight. I need a shower. I need a good meal. I need everything that this place can\u2019t offer.</p><p>I climb out of the sleeping bag, slip on a clean red tank top, a pair of shorts, and pull up my hair into a messy bun. I rub some black stuff off my arm, and then douse myself with perfume before I exit the tent.</p><p>The sun seems really vivid today and stings at my eyes and my thoughts. There\u2019s a guy playing his guitar solo, his melodious voice carrying across the field, and the sound of it brings me a little bit of peace. But the people who surround me look rough and broken, muddy, wearing very little clothing; some have cuts and bruises on them like they got into a fight. This isn\u2019t where I want to be.</p><p>I open the cooler and take out a bottle of water. I twist the cap off and devour half of it in one gulp, letting out a sigh as I put the cap on. The chairs in front of the tent are empty, and when I tap my fingers on Dylan\u2019s and Delilah\u2019s tent no one responds.</p><p>I\u2019m not really sure what my plans are. Who I should be. How I should move forward. Where I should go. But it seems like I should be doing anything else but standing in this exact spot. With the bottle of water in my hand, I start wandering around the outskirts of the field, zigzagging around the tents, searching for a familiar face but wondering if it\u2019s even possible to find one. I keep replaying what happened in the pond and the memory that\u2019s opened up inside me, even though I fought so hard to keep it hidden for the last year. I\u2019d always been so afraid of the memory, fearing my reaction when I finally remembered that awful night. I feared almost everything about that night because I lost so much and I didn\u2019t want to accept it. But after watching the video, hearing his last words, the blunt truth is I\u2019ll have to finally accept that Landon is gone. He left this world forever. And now I need to find away to forgive him and figure out my place in this world. Somehow. Do I want what\u2019s around me? The fake silence? Do I want to keep aimlessly searching for where to go next or finally figure it out?</p><p>The people around me are smoking and drinking, laughing and talking. They make it look so easy. Like just one drink or hit will take it all away. And it does. For a moment. But what about after? Then what?</p><p>I\u2019m considering backtracking to the tent when I round the tailgate of a truck and there they all are. Quinton, Dylan, and Tristan all have their backs to me and on the other side of them are three guys; two that look really tall and one that looks shorter than me and has a bald head like Dylan, only his has tattoos all over it. Delilah\u2019s standing in the middle of them and she has her T-shirt knotted at the bottom so her stomach is showing and her shorts rolled up so high her ass is pretty much hanging out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019s chatting to one of the taller guys who has dark brown hair, oily skin, and yellow-stained teeth, along with a goatee that stretches to his chest. She keeps laughing and smiling, throwing back her head in a flirty way, and I keep waiting for Dylan to get pissed and intervene, but he never does. Then she hands him something, a plastic bag, and the dots connect inside my head. They\u2019re dealing. I\u2019m about to back away, when the shorter, rounder of the three guys notice me. His gaze sweeps across me, and anger masks his sore-covered face.</p><p>\u201cWho the fuck is she?\u201d he asks with a nod of his chin as he cracks his knuckles.</p><p>Suddenly they\u2019re all looking at me and I start to step back, wondering if I should walk or run away when Quinton\u2019s honey-brown eyes lock on me and I think of what he said to me at the pond. It\u2019s almost like he can see the old me, the part of me that I lost. I wonder how, though? How can he see the good?</p><p>I\u2019m backing away, running away, when I stop in my tracks near the corner of the tent. I stare at the pain in his eyes, the dazed look that lets me know he\u2019s not himself, and the pure and utter torture that I still don\u2019t truly understand and I wonder if I ever will. Did I ever really know him? Did he ever really know me? Will we ever really know each other? I\u2019m not sure, but I think I need to find myself first.</p> <p>My feet long to go to him, but my mind has the upper hand this time, because it\u2019s as clear as the sky and suddenly I understand. At this moment in my life I can\u2019t help him, even though I want to so badly that it consumes my body and mind. I want to take his pain away, save him like I couldn\u2019t save Landon, but I\u2019m not strong enough right now. I\u2019m not the strong girl Landon talked about in the video. I wish I was, but I can barely hang on myself, let alone hold someone up with me. I\u2019m understanding this now. I\u2019m suddenly understanding a lot of things. It hurts to realize it and makes it hard to breathe, like my lungs are shrinking or maybe they\u2019re expanding and there\u2019s no more room left in my rib cage. Either way, I\u2019m hyperventilating. I massage my hand over my chest, my heart aching as he stares at me, mystified. I look at the blue sky above us, the dirt below our feet, and a sea of people walking around, a sea we could easy get swept away into.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry, I mouth.</p><p>He stares at me for a moment longer and I can\u2019t tell if he gets what I mean or not, but he nods once before turning away, and I think that maybe, just maybe, he knows what I mean.</p><p>\u201cHey, Nova,\u201d Tristan says, taking a step toward me. He nods his head to the side, indicating for me to walk away. \u201cYou should go.\u201d</p><p>I gladly turn around and walk off toward the tent. One... two... three...</p> <p>\u201cNova, wait,\u201d Tristan says and moments later he grabs my arm, jerking me to a stop.</p><p>I slowly turn around to face him. He looks a little different, his pupils larger, his hair disheveled, and there are bags underneath his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say, wiggling my arm out of his grip. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you guys were busy.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head and then rakes his fingers through his blond locks. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be sorry... it\u2019s just... it\u2019s just better if you weren\u2019t around... that.\u201d His voice sounds subdued and it seems like he\u2019s really struggling to move his lips.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d I say. But it\u2019s not. Nothing is fine. I don\u2019t want to be here anymore.</p><p>\u201cYeah...\u201d He bites on his lip, glancing over his shoulder, and then he ushers me forward, motioning his hands at me. \u201cLook, I remember you in high school and you weren\u2019t... you weren\u2019t like us...\u201d</p><p>Us. Like we\u2019re two different breeds. But we\u2019re not. We\u2019re all just living a different path and seeing life differently\u2014I\u2019m seeing life differently. \u201cI know, but it doesn\u2019t mean I was sheltered. I saw stuff.\u201d I turn my shoulder inward to squeeze through a truck and a tent. \u201cI saw stuff all the time.\u201d Where do I go from here?</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d he says, kicking a cooler out of his path and spilling a beer that was on top of it. \u201cYou were always hanging out with that guy that... died.\u201d</p><p>He did die. A while ago. But he\u2019s gone now. \u201cHis name was Landon,\u201d I say, pressing my hand to my chest. \u201cLandon Evans.\u201d The world starts to spin, but it\u2019s a good spin. A natural spin and I let it be. Please, forgive me.</p><p>When we reach the tent, I sit down in one of the chairs, watching the crowds, and listening to the music as it flows over the field. At one point I shut my eyes and bask in the freeness of the vocals, tapping my foot to the beat of the drum, remembering what it was like to play, when Landon would watch me with almost a smile on his face and I felt happy inside. I let the sound own me, take me over, and pull me back in a direction I was running away from.</p><p>Tristan sits down beside me, and he instantly starts smoking something that smells strange and makes the air just a little bit hotter. The longer it goes on, the more droopy his eyes get, and the more he looks like he\u2019s going to sink into the ground and vanish from the world.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to watch him. I don\u2019t want to be here. I want to go home.</p><p>I sit there, listening to the song, remembering what it was like when I would sit and listen to music with Landon and we\u2019d talk about life and what we\u2019d do when we got older, where we\u2019d go, who we\u2019d become. But that\u2019s gone now, and I need to accept that.</p><p>Please, forgive me.</p><p>\u201cIf you could be anything in the world,\u201d Landon had once asked me, \u201cwhat would you be?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA drummer,\u201d I\u2019d replied easily. \u201cHow about you?\u201d I\u2019d thought I\u2019d known his answer. An artist. How could he say anything else?</p><p>He\u2019d thought about it forever and finally sighed. \u201cI have no idea. Maybe I wouldn\u2019t be anything. Maybe I\u2019d just follow you around to concerts and carry your drumsticks.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d laughed at the time, because it seemed so silly, but thinking about it now, I start to cry. We could have been great together. Perfect. We could have been a lot of things, but now we can\u2019t be anything other than memories.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Tristan says, urging the burning cigarette at me as watches the tears freely rolling down my cheeks. \u201cYou want a hit? It\u2019ll calm you down.\u201d</p><p>I stare at the joint and then back him. Do I want a hit? Do I want this life? Is this the road I\u2019m choosing to go down?</p><p>I shake my head, and then get to my feet. \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I start to back around the chair toward the tent.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d he asks, with the joint positioned between his lips and smoke masking his face.</p><p>I shake my head, backing up to the tent. \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d I duck into the tent, grab my phone, and then climb back out. Tristan\u2019s heading into the crowd, and I think about chasing him down and saying good-bye. I think about telling Delilah that I\u2019m going. I think about telling Quinton I\u2019m sorry.</p><p>But instead I head toward the road, the sun blazing at my back, the clear sky above me, focusing only on myself and the path ahead. I take it step by step, letting myself count, because that\u2019s what I need to do for the moment, but telling myself that I\u2019ll work on breaking the habit when I can. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve admitted aloud that it\u2019s a habit, and it\u2019s liberating and gives me a sense of peace, and in the end, I run.</p><p>I run all the way to the restaurant where Quinton and I had breakfast and he let me cry on his chest. By the time I reach the front door, I\u2019m dripping in sweat and I have no idea how long it took me to get here. But I\u2019m still breathing and my heart\u2019s still beating.</p><p>When I enter, it\u2019s pretty much empty. I sit down and order a coffee, and the waitress looks at me like I\u2019ve just climbed out of a Dumpster. But she\u2019s polite and brings me a coffee along with a piece of pie and says it\u2019s on the house, and I wonder if she thinks I\u2019m a homeless person.</p><p>Eating the pie, I take out my phone and call the one person I know will always be there for me. It rings three times and then she answers.</p><p>\u201cNova, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d she says, worried, and I can tell she\u2019s been crying. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to call you for the last few days, and you haven\u2019t answered your phone.\u201d She starts going off on a rant, but I stop her in the middle of it.</p><p>\u201cMom, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say, wiping the tears from my eyes. \u201cAnd I want to come home.\u201d</p><p>She asks me a billion questions when I tell her where I am, but in the end she tells me she\u2019s coming right now and that she loves me. We hang up and I sit in the booth staring at the trees outside, and sipping the coffee. Eventually, I take my phone out again. At first I just stare at my reflection in the screen. I look terrible. Plain and simple. Pale skin. Big, bloodshot eyes. My brown hair is matted, and there are scratches on my forehead from when I fell in the trees and a bruise on my cheek. It\u2019s like I\u2019ve altered into this monster over the last few months, and I\u2019m just now noticing the change.</p><p>I flip the camera on and clear my throat, preparing to make my final video. \u201cI\u2019m not really sure when I look back at these clips if they\u2019ll mean anything to me or if I\u2019ll even remembering anything of what happened, just like I\u2019ll probably look back to this day and wonder why I decided to leave, other than I finally watched the video and Landon\u2019s words spoke to me. I woke up and finally saw what things really where. I could close down all I wanted, lock who I am out, shut down all the things that happened with Landon... the good and the bad... but in the end they did happen. Just like this moment. Just like this breath I\u2019m taking. Stuff happens. We get lost. We try to control what will happen. We give up. We do things that don\u2019t make sense. We search for things in the wrongest of ways. We lose our way, but sometimes, if we\u2019re really, really strong, we manage to find our way back.\u201d</p><p>I summon a deep breath and put the phone away. Then I rest my head onto the table and quickly fall asleep as the last two months smash down on me.</p><p>Chapter 21</p><p>Aug 20, Day 103 of Summer Break</p><p>Nova</p><p>I\u2019ve heard about revelations before, when people\u2019s eyes open up, and suddenly everything becomes crystal clear. I wouldn\u2019t necessary call what I had a revelation because everything isn\u2019t crystal clear, but I do see things in a different light, or maybe it\u2019s just that I see the light, like the darkness I\u2019ve kept inside me is dissolving. Looking back, it was Landon\u2019s video that finally opened my eyes. It was painful and heartbreaking to watch, but it made me realize so many things, like how he saw me and how he wanted my forgiveness. I\u2019d never thought to forgive him\u2014I hadn\u2019t even realized I was angry with him, not really, anyway. I kept holding on to him, not accepting the wholehearted truth, knowing he was gone but letting go and moving on. I was so lost and unsure of who I was, because I didn\u2019t want to be anything without him. But watching him talk about me like that, saying I was strong, made me want to be strong, Be the person that he was talking about.</p><p>The first week at home was pure and utter hell. Everything everyone said annoyed the shit out of me, and I felt like jabbing their eyes out. I yelled at my mom. I yelled at Daniel. I yelled at the mailman because he rang the doorbell and it woke me up from my nap. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then came the tears. There were a lot. In fact, I was pretty sure they\u2019d never turn off. I\u2019m not even sure why, other than it felt like I was a vampire stepping into the light for the first time, and my skin and brain were on fire and nothing seemed to take away the pain.</p><p>But then my mom and I started to talk. We talked about my dad. We talked about Landon. We talked about me. We talked about what I did. We talked and talked and talked. She got angry and I cried. She cried and I cried.</p><p>\u201cNova,\u201d she said through tears. \u201cI feel like this is all my fault. I knew when your father died... how he died... that you saw it, that it had to be hard for you, but I never forced you to talk about it with me. I only suggested it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I couldn\u2019t talk about it with you,\u201d I\u2019d replied, hugging a pillow against my chest, balled up on the bed. \u201cYou were sad yourself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m your mother,\u201d she said, smoothing my hair away from my forehead, like I was still a little kid, and maybe at the moment to her I was. Maybe we were going back in time and doing what we should have done to begin with. \u201cIt\u2019s my job to make sure you\u2019re okay, even if I\u2019m hurting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to make you hurt more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not how it works. If anything we should have hurt together.\u201d</p><p>We started to cry again, and it seem like we were never going to stop, but finally, like almost everything always eventually does, our tears faded.</p><p>It\u2019s been over a month since I ran away from the concert, and my head is a lot clearer than it\u2019s been in a very long time, maybe even since my dad died. It\u2019s strange, but it took all this time for me to realize just how hazy things had gotten. Somehow, through Landon\u2019s death, through wrangling the mourning, through life, I lost my way. I\u2019m still working my way back from it, one baby step at a time, trying to heal myself correctly this time.</p> <p>I managed to take out the sketches Landon\u2019s parents gave to me and let myself cry without running away from them. They really were beautiful sketches, and it hurts to think that his talent doesn\u2019t exist anymore, but I have a piece of his talent still\u2014a piece of him\u2014and I\u2019ll always hold on to it. I\u2019ve finally accepted his death, and it\u2019s good to remember him in healthy doses. I\u2019m learning that it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay to hurt. It\u2019s okay to cry. It\u2019s okay to admit when we need help. It\u2019s okay to let go.</p><p>Not everything is easy and perfect, though. I still need my anxiety medication. I still find myself counting sometimes. I still get lost in memories of Landon. The key is letting it pass instead of searching for a quick Off switch. I feel it, I move with it, and then I move past it.</p><p>And I don\u2019t have to move past it alone. I\u2019ve been going to a group where people can talk about loss, specifically related to suicide. It helps to hear stories, to know I\u2019m not the only one to wonder so much that it nearly cracked my head open. I plan on going to one when I\u2019m back at school. I\u2019ve also finally picked a major. Film. I\u2019m still not one hundred percent sure if I want to stick with it, but it\u2019s a start to working on some of my goals or at least setting them. I also might do a minor in music, but I\u2019m taking it one step at a time now. I\u2019m focusing on moving forward and slowly accepting the past, getting better, and trying to create a future. And I know I\u2019ll be able to because I want to. And just like my dad told me once: if you want something bad enough, anything\u2019s possible.</p><p>I haven\u2019t talked to Quinton since I left. Delilah stopped by my house a few times, but we\u2019re no longer on the same page, and I\u2019m not strong enough to bring her up with me, nor can I fall with her. She\u2019s not going back to school, something she disclosed during her third visit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy here,\u201d she\u2019d said while we sat on the living room couch. My mom wouldn\u2019t let us go into my room, afraid of what we\u2019d do behind closed doors, and I was okay with that. I\u2019m afraid of closed doors, too.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you should stay,\u201d I\u2019d said, noting how thin she was starting to look. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing here, really.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s Dylan. And my life,\u201d she replied snippily. \u201cAnd that matters to me.\u201d</p><p>Her pupils were wide and shiny, and she had this funny smell to her. She\u2019s also chopped her hair off and her skin was a little pallid. I could tell she was on something, and that the person sitting in front of me was not the Delilah I met back in high school. This was her alter ego. A darker side of her. A reflection in a cracked mirror.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, knowing I had to let her go, but it was hard. \u201cBut if you change your mind, I leave on Friday and you can come with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d She got up from the couch, left my house, and I haven\u2019t seen her since.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you just don\u2019t want to stay home for a semester?\u201d My mom asks, carrying out the last of the boxes, the one that carries my drumsticks. I\u2019m taking the pink drums back to school with me, even though I haven\u2019t played them again yet. I\u2019m planning on it, though, when it feels right.</p><p>\u201cAre you seriously trying to talk me into dropping out of school?\u201d I joke, tossing a section of my drums onto the leather backseat of the cherry-red Nova. I\u2019m driving it back to school, which is scary, but it\u2019s one of my goals. Besides, it\u2019s what my dad wanted.</p><p>She sighs, pushing the trunk closed. \u201cNo, but I worry.\u201d She walks up to me, with her arms crossed, like she\u2019s resisting the urge to grab me and haul me back into the house. \u201cI feel like I just got you back and now you\u2019re leaving me again.\u201d</p><p>I hug her, and I mean really hug her, without fear or restraint. \u201cI know, but it\u2019s a good thing, Mom. It\u2019s... it\u2019s my way of moving on.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know, Nova,\u201d she hugs me tightly to the point that I can barely breathe. \u201cAnd I\u2019m proud of you for admitting everything to me. Whether you think so or not, you\u2019re a brave person.\u201d She pulls back and looks me in the eyes. \u201cNot many people can admit they\u2019re heading down the wrong path.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut doesn\u2019t it kind of make me weak for even going down the path?\u201d I ask, blinking against the bright sunlight, refusing to shield my eyes from it.</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cWe all do stuff that isn\u2019t great. You\u2019ve been through a lot... a lot more than most. And the important thing is you pulled yourself out of it.\u201d Tears start to bubble up in the corners of her blue eyes. \u201cI\u2019m just glad to have my daughter back.\u201d</p><p>Not completely, but I\u2019m working on it, and that\u2019s the important part. \u201cI love you too, Mom.\u201d</p><p>She embraces me in a hug, and it\u2019s hard to get her to let me go, but ultimately she does and I get into the car, and she heads into the house. I take a deep breath, buckle my seat belt, and then reach for my phone in my pocket.</p><p>I hold the phone up to my eye level and then hit Record.</p><p>\u201cIn a sense it kind of seems like I\u2019m starting over, like it\u2019s freshman year again.\u201d I roll my eyes, but then smile, and it\u2019s a real smile, not the fake, plastic ones I\u2019ve been using for the last year. \u201cBecause I was so out of it last year, I could barely comprehend what was going on. But now I\u2019m ready to embrace what lies ahead of me instead of drifting through it. I don\u2019t want to drift. That broken, lost, wandering, searching-for-something-that-will-never-exist-again Nova is not who I want to be. And while I don\u2019t know exactly who I am, the important part is that I\u2019m focusing on discovering it in a healthy way.\u201d</p><p>I smile, and it brightens up the whole screen. \u201cHopefully the next video I make, I\u2019ll have more.\u201d I pause, taking a deep breath. \u201cNow I just need to make one more stop, because if I\u2019ve learned anything, good-byes are important, even if they\u2019re scary and awkward. Always, always, say good-bye.\u201d</p><p>I click off the camera and put it away, heading down the driveway with one thought in my mind.</p><p>Time to let go and move forward.</p><p>When I pull up to the trailer park, it takes me a moment to gather myself together and find the strength to get out of the car. My first instinct is to start counting all the cracks in the house, the buckets in front of the fence, the broken windows. But I calm myself down and remind myself that I need to do this; otherwise I\u2019ll regret it.</p><p>I get out, walk through the gate, and trot up the steps to the front door. I smooth down my hair, tug the bottom of my shorts down, and adjust one of the fallen straps on my shirt. Then I raise my hand and knock on the door.</p><p>There\u2019s a lot of banging going on side the house, along with laughter, and I can also hear music. I knock again, louder, and a few moments later the door swings open.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing here?\u201d Dylan asks. He looks different, thinner, paler, grungier, with sunken eyes, and sores all over his face, and his shaved head almost looks wrinkly. \u201cDo you want to talk to Delilah or something?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, crossing my arms over my chest, telling myself that I\u2019m okay. Everything is okay. \u201cNo, I want to talk to Quinton.\u201d</p><p>He rolls his eyes, annoyed, and then opens the door wider. Smoke spills out like poison vapor and I\u2019m not sure whether I hate the scent or miss it. \u201cHe\u2019s in his room.\u201d</p><p>I take a step back toward the stairs, knowing that until I can hate the scent, I need to stay away. \u201cCan you go get him?\u201d I ask as politely as I can.</p><p>He cusses under his breath, his face reddening, and I think he\u2019s going to slam the door in my face. But then he says, \u201cHang on.\u201d</p><p>He leaves the door open, and I catch a glimpse of the people inside, doing things that want to pull me in. I take another step back, continuing until I reach the bottom of the stairs. Then I sit down on the step and wait for him. The music keeps bumping, vibrating against the ground, and I hear someone shout something about everyone taking their clothes off and it\u2019s echoed by cheering. I want to leave, but I need to do this.</p><p>Wait for him.</p><p>Seconds later, I hear his voice, and it makes my heart leap inside my chest. \u201cNova, what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>I turn around, preparing myself to see him again, but it still impacts me more than I hoped. He looks different, too, thinner, paler, and his jawline is scruffy and unshaven. His hair has grown out a little and is sticking up all over his head. But his eyes are still the same honey-brown-tinted red and overflowing with sorrow.</p><p>I get to my feet and brush off the dirt from the backs of my legs. \u201cI came to say good-bye.\u201d</p><p>He smashes his lips together as he hesitates at the top of the steps. He doesn\u2019t have a shirt on, and his jeans hang loose at his waist. I can see his muscles are diminishing and not as firm as the last time I saw him, and the tattoos on his arms: Lexi, Ryder, and no one, along with the scar he never told me about, either. One day, if I ever see him again, I\u2019ll have to get him to tell me what they mean and where the scar came from, when we\u2019re both in a different place and can handle it. I want to be there for him, and help him with whatever he\u2019s going through, but I have to heal myself first before I can be a good support system. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLook,\u201d he starts, taking a step onto the stairs. \u201cAbout what happened\u2014\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, holding my hand up, and cutting him off. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to talk about that right now. I\u2019m just headed back to school and I wanted to say good-bye and to make sure that you understood something.\u201d</p><p>His forehead creases as he steps down another stair. \u201cOkay...\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve been preparing what I was going to say to him for a couple of weeks, when I realized what I needed\u2014wanted. But standing here in front of him, it\u2019s hard. But I\u2019m going to do it.</p> <p>\u201cI know I\u2019ve been kind of screwed up,\u201d I say, tipping my chin up to meet his eyes. \u201cAnd I still am kind of screwed up and trying to figure out everything that happened over the summer... It feels kind of like a daze, you know.\u201d I pause. \u201cBut I\u2019m glad I met you... you kind of made me realize a lot of stuff.\u201d</p><p>He scratches his head, glancing around like he has no idea what the hell is going on. \u201cNova, I don\u2019t get what you\u2019re saying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really saying anything,\u201d I explain the best way I know how. But in the end, I don\u2019t know if it makes sense, because nothing about us made sense, except for the fact that we were falling together. \u201cOther than good-bye.\u201d</p><p>His expression softens and he steps in front of me. He looks me over, from head to toe, like he\u2019s trying to decipher who I am. \u201cYou look good,\u201d he finally says. \u201cDifferent, but good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel good,\u201d I say, and for once it feels like the truth. \u201cAnd different.\u201d</p> <p>He sighs and I release a breath, then suddenly we\u2019re hugging each other. He\u2019s a little resistant, his muscles stiff, but I help him out, wrapping my arms firmly around him. Closing my eyes, I breathe him in, unsure if I\u2019ll ever see him again, but hoping. Maybe. One day. When I\u2019m in a different place.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispers in my ear. \u201cFor everything.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head with my cheek pressed against his chest. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be sorry. Everything I did was my choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill nothing,\u201d I say. \u201cNothing was your fault.\u201d</p><p>He stills, his pulse thudding inside his chest. We hold on to each other, until my arms grow heavy and then I know it\u2019s time to go, otherwise I might not. I pull back first and offer a smile as I back away to the car.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re ever in Idaho, look me up,\u201d I say, waving as I reach the gate.</p><p>He nods, but it doesn\u2019t look like he thinks he\u2019ll see me again. \u201cOkay, I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd take care of yourself,\u201d I tell him, which seems like a really silly, clich\u00e9 thing to say, but it\u2019s all I can say right now. If I said meaningful things, like that I care for him, loved kissing him, that my heart aches that I\u2019m leaving him, that I wish it were another time in our lives when we met so we could be together, then it\u2019d be harder to leave. Because even though it\u2019s hard, I need to go and heal.</p><p>He smiles, but it\u2019s forced, unreal, sad, and I want to cry for him. \u201cYeah, you too.\u201d He watches me all the way to the car and when I\u2019m about to climb in, he calls out, \u201cSo you finally decided to drive the car.\u201d</p><p>I swallow hard, nod, and open the gate. \u201cYeah, it seemed like it was time.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, he lets out a breath, and starts toward the door. \u201cTake care of yourself, Nova, like the car.\u201d A touch of a smile appears on his face.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d I return his smile, and then I climb into the car and back away, gripping the steering wheel as I watch him slip further away.</p><p>He watches me until I\u2019m just about out of sight, then he turns around and walks into the house. And I keep driving. I\u2019m ready. Moving forward, I\u2019m ready to start moving on.</p> <p>Quinton</p><p>I\u2019m happy for her. She looks good. More than good. She looks happy. It\u2019s amazing to see, and it makes me wonder how she got to that place after everything, but I don\u2019t want to ask her, fearing I\u2019ll ruin it for her.</p><p>After she took off from the concert, I knew we\u2019d never be anything. It was good she ran away, and I made sure to keep my distance, even though it hurt not to see her. I miss the sound of her rare laugh, her smile, her random thoughts, her love for music, her smell, the way she feels. But she\u2019s better off without me.</p><p>I watch her drive away, knowing I\u2019ll never see her again. I wish I could have kissed her one last time, a real kiss, one that wasn\u2019t diluted by drugs and guilt. But I know it\u2019s not possible, and when she drives out of my sight, I head back to the reality of my life.</p><p>Dylan has a bunch of customers over, although only half of them end up paying, the others pretending like they\u2019re just sampling his stuff. It\u2019s part of my life now. He makes the arrangements, Tristan and I deliver for him, and then we get high, pass out, and start the whole process of falling all over again. The viscous, repetitive circle of my life. But I don\u2019t deserve anything more.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to fucking go with us?\u201d Dylan asks, as I head back toward the curtain. He\u2019s sitting on the couch with Delilah, but she\u2019s passed out on his lap, and he\u2019s flirting with another girl.</p><p>I nod, drawing the curtain back. \u201cYeah, I just got to put a shirt on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should keep it off,\u201d some girl yells from the kitchen. She\u2019s smoking on a joint, and I think her name is Candy or Kitty or something. Honestly, it could be Brenda. I really don\u2019t remember her other than I slept with her a few times and we shared a few lines, then talked about shit that doesn\u2019t matter, even though we pretended it did.</p><p>I ignore her and go back to my pathetic little room that reminds me of what I\u2019ve become. I put a shirt on and slip on some shoes. Then I pick up my sketchbook, glancing at the last picture I\u2019ll ever draw. It was created from memory, images I hate but needed to get out. Each line is heavy, like I was trying to cut through the paper with my pencil. It\u2019s of Lexi and me lying side by side in the field beside the accident. We\u2019re holding hands and bleeding out together\u2014dying together. It\u2019s perfect. It\u2019s real. And it\u2019s where I\u2019ll always belong.</p><p>I let out a deep breath, shut the sketchbook, and tuck it away in a box next to the dresser. I\u2019m about to walk out of my room, when Tristan walks in carrying a mirror with a white line of powder running across it and a razor in his hand. My hands instantly itch to hold it, my mouth salivating to taste it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to need this,\u201d he says, urging it at me. His eyes are pretty much popping out of his head, and his nose is a little red and running. \u201cWe have a long night ahead of us.\u201d</p><p>I snatch the mirror and immediately take what he offers me, not because I need to stay awake, but because I want it. Need it. It\u2019s embedded into my skin, my blood, my veins, my thoughts, my dreams. It\u2019s my life.</p><p>It owns me now.</p><p>Once it hits the back of my throat, all the doors in my head slam shut and any good left in me is locked behind them.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Nine months later...</p><p>May 9, 7 days before Summer Break</p><p>Nova</p><p>I\u2019m supposed to be packing up the last of my stuff in my apartment, getting ready to head home for summer, while I work on the last of my finals, but I\u2019ve taken a break to pound on my drums. I do it almost every day now, and I\u2019m finding therapeutic.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind! The neighbors are going to call the landlord again if you keep it up!\u201d My friend and roommate, Lea, calls out. I bang on the drums a little harder, teasing her, and she rolls her eyes and laughs. \u201cFine, be a bitch.\u201d</p><p>I laugh, hitting one more note, and then set the drumsticks down. I\u2019m sweating and panting, but I feel so alive inside. Catching my breath, I climb off the stool and head over to a half-packed box on my bed. It\u2019s strange to be going back home, since the last time I was there I was in such a different place than I am now. But it\u2019ll be good to see my mom again and even Daniel, granola bars and all.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to take this with you?\u201d My friend Lea asks as she holds up an old band poster of Chevelle.</p><p>I nod, tucking the last of my CDs away into a box on my bed. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s all torn and ripped.\u201d</p><p>She rolls her heavily lined eyes and drops it into the trash can next to the shelf. \u201cOkay, if that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I want,\u201d I tell her, clicking my computer on as I sit down on the floor in front of it.</p><p>I met Lea at one of the meetings I\u2019d been attending for people who have lost loved ones to suicide. Lea lost her dad when she was about twelve, strangely around the same time as I lost my dad. That was our initial conversation starter, but we hit it off really quickly, and it\u2019s nice to have someone I can openly talk to about my feelings of Landon\u2019s suicide; the hurt, the anger, the guilt, the feeling of being lost and confused. She\u2019s felt the same things too, only she handled it in a different, healthier way.</p><p>In the beginning stages of our friendship, she gave me hope that I could move on, and now she\u2019s just there for me. We\u2019ve been friends for about six months now, and it\u2019s a good friendship, one not based on drunken outings, heavy drugs, drifting. We share a lot of things in common, like a love for music and a good documentary. She plays guitar and her boyfriend sings. They\u2019re fun to hang out with, and we all volunteer to help out at the local suicide hotline. It\u2019s nice to do something good. Help people. We also laugh. A lot.</p><p>I\u2019ve even been on a few dates, but haven\u2019t really felt the spark or connection with anyone. That\u2019s okay, though. I have time. And it\u2019s nice to know that I do.</p><p>Not everything is always easy though. There are dark moments, when I get overwhelmed, and I start to count and crave the silent solitude that I experienced last summer. But it always passes. And it\u2019s happening less frequently. I know what I want in life. I want happiness. I want hope. I want a life. And that\u2019s important. I consider myself lucky for being able to get where I am. It\u2019s not easy and not everyone makes it. Some people stay in the dark and some people leave it a different, more permanent way, while I managed to step into the light again.</p><p>\u201cAre you still working on that?\u201d she asks, gathering her long black hair into a side ponytail. She\u2019s wearing an old T-shirt with \u201cMusic Rocks my World\u201d written on the back, and a pair of denim shorts. She\u2019s tall and has a few tattoos. Each one means something to her, and every time I see one of them, it always makes me wonder about Quinton\u2019s tattoos. \u201cYou know it\u2019s due in four days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I move the curser to the videos folder on the home screen. I\u2019ve watched the videos time and time again, and it\u2019s scary watching how much I changed over the course of two and a half months. In the end, I barely looked like me, and I never want to go back to that place again. \u201cI think I might end up taking a zero on it, though.\u201d</p><p>I really want to use the clips for the final, even if it means showing the world what I was once because I feel like it\u2019s important for people to see. And there\u2019s one video I really want to use; the one I made of Quinton. I watch it all the time, wondering what he\u2019s doing, thinking. It feels like I\u2019m finally in a point in my life where I can talk to him again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lea sits down on the floor beside me, crisscrossing her legs, and resting back on her palms. \u201cIf you take the zero, you\u2019re going to fail the class.\u201d</p><p>I sigh, clicking the folder. \u201cI know, but I can\u2019t use the video without a signed release form. Professor\u2019s rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen get his permission,\u201d she answers, reaching for her purse. She takes out a pack of gum and pops a piece into her mouth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve tried.\u201d I reach for the computer\u2019s Off button. I have tried. A lot. But I never did get his number, and I\u2019ve yet to be able to track his phone number down. I\u2019ve tried to call Delilah a few times, but it always sends me straight to voice mail. I even sent my mom over to the trailer, but she said it was vacant, so apparently they moved somewhere else. It\u2019s like that whole part of my life didn\u2019t even exist, like it never really happened. But it did, and I remind myself every day that it did, because it\u2019s important to remember how easy it is to lose track of myself and just how lucky I am that I made it out. But I can\u2019t find him anywhere. It\u2019s like he\u2019s disappeared off the face of the earth.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t disappear off the face of the earth,\u201d she says. \u201cYou could try calling that... old friend of yours again.\u201d Lea knows all about Delilah and she\u2019s not a fan. I think she blames some of the stuff that I went through on her, but I don\u2019t blame Delilah for anything. Everything I did was my own choice. No one forced me.</p><p>Sighing, I scoop my phone off my bed. \u201cYeah, I guess I can, even though I\u2019ve left her a ton of voice mails already.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cIt can\u2019t hurt to try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it can\u2019t.\u201d I press Delilah\u2019s number on my phone and then hold it up to my ear. I wait and wait and I\u2019m about to hang up, when suddenly there\u2019s a click.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Delilah says from the other side. There\u2019s loud music playing in the background and a lot of banging and yelling.</p> <p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s me,\u201d I tell her. \u201cNova.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho!\u201d she shouts. \u201cHold on! Let me go somewhere quiet.\u201d There\u2019s a pause and then I try to wait patiently. The noise gradually fades and finally it goes quiet. \u201cThere we go,\u201d she says and I can tell by the slur in her speech that she\u2019s high or drunk. \u201cNow who the hell is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Nova,\u201d I tell her, shaking my head. Lea is watching me with worry and I hold up my finger, stepping out of the room. I head to the sliding glass door and step out onto the back deck and into the sunlight. \u201cNova, the girl you used to be friends with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She lets out a giggle. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m a little out of it, but now I remember.\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath, reminding myself that I\u2019ve been in that place where nothing matters. \u201cHey, I just wanted to see if you knew where Quinton was,\u201d I tell her, leaning my elbows onto the railing, praying she can remember who he is.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s with me,\u201d she replies, and I hear the flick of a lighter. I wonder what she\u2019s smoking or where she even is. \u201cWell, he\u2019s actually in the house right now. Not outside with me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut he lives with you.\u201d I\u2019m shocked. \u201cAre you... are you guys dating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo... we just share an apartment... with Dylan. You remember him, right?\u201d She inhales and then releases a strong exhale, coughing at the end.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I remember,\u201d I say, disappointed that she\u2019s still with him. I shift my weight, rotating my back to the railing, and inclining against it. \u201cLook, can you put him on the phone. I really need to talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t right now,\u201d she says, coughing again. \u201cHe\u2019s passed out in his room. He\u2019s totally crashing right now.\u201d</p><p>I press my hand against my chest, telling myself to take deep breaths. Nothing changes. Oh my God, my heart hurts so much. \u201cCan you please just go try and wake him up? It\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t wake up,\u201d she assures me. \u201cNot after being up for like three days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? What was he on?\u201d I hold my breath, scared, nervous, and I don\u2019t even know what else. So many emotions are racing through me simultaneously at the moment, and I need to get control again, but not with numbers. I take a deep breath and then another.</p><p>\u201cSome really fucking good crystal,\u201d she says with envy in her tone, letting out a euphoric grunt at the end.</p> <p>\u201cCrystal meth.\u201d I\u2019m stunned. Horrified. I struggle for air. \u201cWhy would he do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do we all do it?\u201d she asks and then starts to chatter on, the speed of her voice picking up with each word. \u201cBecause we\u2019re running away from stuff. Me, my mom... and Dylan, well there\u2019s so much with him. Although, Quinton has it the worst, you know. Killing his girlfriend and cousin like that in that fucking car accident.\u201d She sucks in a sharp breath, talking so quickly I can barely interpret what she\u2019s saying. \u201cPlus he died himself. Jesus, to die and then live after that with all those deaths on your hands.... Crystal is his sanctuary.\u201d</p><p>A lump the size of a baseball forms inside my throat as I recollect Quinton\u2019s tattoos. Lexi and Ryder. No one. Is that what it meant? Is no one Quinton? I\u2019m choking. I stop breathing. I can\u2019t remember how to get air into my lungs. I grip onto the railing, feeling like I\u2019m going to fall over.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d I say, breathless as memories of Quinton rapidly flip through my head. \u201cAll that time I spent with him and I didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Everything is starting to make sense. All the anguish and guilt in his eyes... how he always looked so depressed. The scar on his chest and how Tristan threw the driving thing in his face. He was carrying this all inside of him, the deaths, his own death. Even with everything I\u2019ve been through, I couldn\u2019t even imagine.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you didn\u2019t care enough to know,\u201d Delilah says venomously. \u201cYou know he broke even more when you left him\u2014left us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI left for a reason.\u201d For a moment I feel guilty, but then I remember that there was nothing I could have done at the time. I was in my own dark place, falling myself, and trying to stop myself from crashing along with someone else wasn\u2019t impossible. It takes strength to rise back up, strength in yourself and from those around you. I didn\u2019t have that at the time. But now I do. Now it feels like I could try to help him climb back up instead of fall with him. But I know better than to try to do it alone.</p><p>\u201cDelilah, where are you?\u201d I ask. \u201cYou\u2019re not still living in Maple Grove, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we moved... had to get away from that stupid, judging town, you know,\u201d she says simply, and then I hear someone\u2019s voice in the background. \u201cLook, I gotta go. It was nice talking to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDelilah, please don\u2019t hang up,\u201d I say, but it\u2019s too late. The line goes dead. I try to call her back multiple times, but each time it goes to voice mail. \u201cShit.\u201d I slide the glass door open and hurry back to my room.</p><p>\u201cI need your help,\u201d I tell Lea as I rush in, trying not to panic, but it\u2019s difficult. \u201cWith something really important.\u201d</p><p>She nods without question. \u201cYou know I\u2019m always here for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I take a deep breath, knowing she means it. And I\u2019m glad. It\u2019s going to help me through this because I\u2019m going to find Quinton and help him, like I wish I had been able to a year ago.</p><p>I just hope that I\u2019m not too late. That the small glimpses of the caring, good, thriving Quinton that I saw still exist. The one that made me smile when I thought it was impossible. The one that tried to talk me out of drugs because he thought I was too good. I hope that the sadness in his eyes hasn\u2019t entirely taken over.</p><p>I hope he\u2019s not lost completely. </p> </body></html>"]
