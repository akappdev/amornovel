Those girls are ...\u201d Dallas Gutierrez shuddered. \u201cWhat\u2019s way worse than rough? \u2018Cause that\u2019s what they are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, exactly, are you trying to say?\u201d Mia Snow leaned away from her desk, crossed her arms, and peered at the gorgeous man across from her. Perfectly tanned skin, perfectly symmetrical features\u2014or so he liked to brag\u2014and the perfectly formed body of an underwear model. Lean, yet sculpted with muscle. All that perfection aside, he was an absolute pain in her ass. \u201cAnd by the way, I\u2019m not rough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect\u201d ice blue eyes rolled. \u201cYou once kneed me in the balls and asked me how they tasted. Just to say hi. You\u2019re rough.\u201d</p> <p>She had, hadn\u2019t she? Memories were fun. \u201cWhy are you complaining? There were no complications during your testicle retrieval operation. So, anyway, what\u2019d they do this time?\u201d</p><p>They. Best friends. AIR\u2014Alien Investigation and Removal\u2014trainees Ava Sans and Noelle Tremain.</p><p>Dallas tangled a hand through that thick, dark mane of his, looking like a lost little puppy rather than the stone-cold killer he was. \u201cGet this. I took all ten of the advanced placement trainees on an assignment last night. Call came in, you see. Was told a predatory otherworlder was picking on humans at a bar. The fine group of boys and girls I took was just supposed to observe as I threw my pimp hand around, bitch slapping as necessary, and calming things down.\u201d</p><p>Okay. What had happened to the morose, utterly annoying Dallas of the past few months? The one who whined and complained about, well, everything? There\u2019s a smoking-hot alien queen who wants to screw me, but I can\u2019t encourage her because her partners always turn into cannibals, whaa, whaa, whaa. My best friend Devyn married his vampire lover so I don\u2019t have anyone to play with, whaa, whaa, whaa. I\u2019m your husband\u2019s blood slave, whaa, whaa, fucking whaa. If she heard that last one more time, she was going to make him taste his balls again.</p><p>He was alive, wasn\u2019t he? He had cool new powers like mind control and superspeed, didn\u2019t he? Kyrin, her too-sexy-for-words husband, had saved Dallas\u2019s ass by sharing his Arcadian blood\u2014and was now training Dallas\u2019s ass. Dallas should have been this happy all along.</p> <p>But at least the old, everything-is-a-joke Dallas was making an appearance today, she thought, rather than the new I-want-to-slash-my-wrists Dallas. Courtesy of Ava and Noelle, a two-woman Apocalypse? She\u2019d have to send the girls a fruit basket. Or maybe something they could actually use, like a fire and brimstone basket.</p><p>\u201cContinue,\u201d Mia said with an imperial wave of her hand.</p><p>Dallas nodded, a bit disappointed. Probably because she hadn\u2019t complimented his bitch-slapping abilities. Baby. \u201cThe otherworlder refused to calm vdown, said the humans told his woman she hadn\u2019t just been hit with the ugly stick but the entire tree had fallen on her, and the assholes owed her an apology. The humans, of course, told me they\u2019d only spoken the truth and that I should arrest the bastard alien for harassing them about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich you didn\u2019t.\u201d Even though the arrest would have been standard protocol. But Mia was head of AIR now\u2014three cheers for her boss deciding to retire early!\u2014and was in the process of making a few changes. No longer would aliens be arrested for defending themselves or demanding respect for their race.</p><p>Secretly part otherworlder herself, she was flat-out done with prejudice. And now that Kyrin\u2019s blood flowed through Dallas\u2019s veins\u2014again secretly\u2014Dallas thankfully was, too.</p><p>\u201cNope. I didn\u2019t,\u201d her second-in-command confirmed with the slightest hint of relish. \u201cAnyway, while I was apologizing to the otherworlder for all humans and their idiot tongues, Ava and Noelle went Death Match on the assholes in question. Now, I didn\u2019t see who started it, you understand, just heard a commotion and turned around. By that time the humans, who were both big, burly males, were unconscious and bleeding on the ground, and Ava and Noelle were grinning and banging their fists together in a job well done.\u201d</p> <p>Mia cut back a moan. Changes, good. High incident rate, bad. There was going to be hell\u2014and apparently hospital bills\u2014to pay for that Death Match. Not just for the males, but for herself. \u2018Cause yeah, top brass would rip into her until she begged for mercy. Which meant they would pretty much rip into her until she bled to death, because she never begged for anything. Well, except when Kyrin got her into bed.</p><p>Three boos for her boss deciding to retire early. Had he stayed, this would have been his problem.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019d the girls say when you asked about the carnage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAva said her hand accidentally slipped and made contact with her guy\u2019s nose. I said, Repeatedly? And she said, \u2018Uh, yeah. I\u2019m really clumsy.\u2019 And Noelle said her guy was trying to escape, so she took him down like we\u2019d trained her. And oh, we shouldn\u2019t worry about the gaping wound in his neck because he probably had that before he entered the bar.\u201d</p><p>First, how was Noelle such a hardass? The girl was Jaxon Tremain\u2019s cousin, and Jaxon was one of AIR\u2019s staunchest rule followers. Not to mention, both were richer than Kyrin, who was richer than God. Noelle had been raised in a mansion, for all that was holy, her every need attended to by servants. She should be delicate.</p><p>Jaxon\u2019s wife a bad influence, maybe? After all, Jaxon was married to the meanest female Mia had ever met. A female who was part robot\u2014literally! Mishka actually had a longer kill list than Mia. And while Mia\u2019s list consisted of gunshot and knife wounds, Mishka\u2019s featured acid, thumbtacks, and for the people Robot Girl really hated, spoons.</p><p>Nah, Mia thought then. The pair hadn\u2019t been married that long, and Noelle\u2019s first disorderly conduct arrest had happened years ago. Mia knew because she\u2019d studied Tremain\u2019s lengthy file before allowing the overindulged delinquent anywhere near the AIR building.</p><p>Now, poor but deceptively sweet-looking Ava, Mia understood. The girl had double the arrests, but then, she\u2019d grown up on New Chicago\u2019s dirtiest streets. Just like Mia had. There, you were predator or prey, and there was no middle ground.</p> <p>How had the wealthy girl and the impoverished girl hooked up? Jail? And how the hell had they remained friends all these years?</p><p>Mia sighed. \u201cSo what you\u2019re telling me, Dally, is that it\u2019s time to promote these two heathens.\u201d</p><p>Dallas grinned, revealing straight white teeth. He made a production of that grin, reminding her of a curtain rising from a movie screen, an eager crowd desperate for the show to begin. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you do it, Mee, but you always reach the moral of the story without any prompting from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m smarter than you. Anyway, they gotta complete a mission on their own before I can officially offer them a place on my team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do we got on the chopping block? And by the way, I\u2019m smarter than you. My IQ is off the charts, man.\u201d</p><p>If the chart only reached fifty, then yeah. No need to tax his poor brain with numbers, though. Silent, she let her head fall against the back of her chair and stared up at the ceiling. They were inside her new office, and she\u2019d had the panels painted blue and white, a replica of the sky, to help with her claustrophobia. This way, she could pretend she was lying on the ground in her spacious backyard with Kyrin resting beside her.</p><p>\u201cMcKell,\u201d she finally said, thinking of the latest case to hit her desk.</p><p>\u201cOuch,\u201d Dallas said. \u201cDousing the girls in gasoline and throwing them straight into the fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor McKell, though.\u201d</p><p>Poor girls. McKell was a vampire warrior able to stop time in short bursts, do his damage with no one the wiser, then restart the clock, leaving the raging flames of hell in his wake. His own people had kicked him out of their underground world for being \u201cunstable.\u201d The term amused her\u2014the man had slaughtered hundreds of vampires for daring to lock him up for a few days. Unstable? Try psychotic.</p><p>AIR wanted to talk to him about his actions. Preferably alive. But no one had been able to bring him in. In fact, Mia had sent three top-of-the-line agents to apprehend him\u2014bastard wasn\u2019t even trying to hide\u2014and he\u2019d sent all three back with severe blood loss, missing fingers, and brain damage. Fine. The agents had been brain damaged before encountering McKell, but then, weren\u2019t all men?</p><p>Exhibit A: Dallas.</p><p>Maybe Ava and Noelle would have better luck. Besides, it was a scientific fact that females always outperformed males. And who was she to mess with science?</p><p>Sure, Jaxon and thereby Mishka would kick up a fit when they heard Little Miss Cousin would be going after a vampire, but Mia didn\u2019t exactly care. Bring on the spoons, bitch. But maybe she\u2019d send the couple on a prolonged vacay, just in case. Plus, it wouldn\u2019t do for Jaxon to give the girls a helping hand. And he would. He wouldn\u2019t be able to help himself, and that would do a lot of damage to their street cred. The girls were moving up the ladder fast, so they had a lot to prove\u2014on their own\u2014or none of the other agents would ever take them seriously.</p><p>And if the girls did this, if they brought in the big bad, no one would be able to question Mia\u2019s decision to advance them rather than incarcerate them. Even better, Ava and Noelle might just think hunting and capturing a rabid vampire was a good time.</p><p>\u201cPrep them without telling them why they were chosen or what\u2019s at stake, and send them out.\u201d That way, they\u2019d work this case the same way they worked the rest of their cases, without putting on a dog-and-pony show trying to impress her, and Mia could discover just how much determination those \u201crough\u201d girls possessed.</p><p>Dallas snickered.</p><p>Mia blinked over at him, confused. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said \u2018stake,\u2019 and they\u2019re going after a vampire. Get it? Stake ... a vampire? Like in old books and movies.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re such a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re a jealous old woman because you didn\u2019t think of it yourself. Said with affection, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a year younger than you, jackass. Said with annoyance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you\u2019re only younger physically.\u201d</p><p>Brain. Damaged. She liked the morose Dallas better, she decided. \u201cHave you forgotten that you\u2019re wanted by a diseased alien queen, your best friend is busy with his wife, and you\u2019re Kyrin\u2019s blood slave?\u201d</p><p>Dallas flipped her off, but his grin never faded.</p><p>Maybe she wasn\u2019t on top of her game, because she automatically returned that grin with one of her own.</p><p>\u201cYou love me, you know you do,\u201d he said confidentially.</p><p>True.</p><p>\u201cSeriously. You\u2019re like my mom, and I\u2019m like your favorite son. No matter what I do or say, you\u2019ll always think I\u2019m adorable.\u201d</p><p>Mia stood and leaned over the desk. She crooked her finger at him as if she had a secret to share. He, too, leaned forward, eager to learn that secret\u2014poor, brain-damaged kid\u2014and she punched him in the nose. \u201cThere. Now I\u2019m like the mom who keeps her stupid shithead in line with a firm hand.\u201d</p><p>He laughed as blood trickled down his lips and chin. \u201cSee. Rough.\u201d</p><p>And he thought Ava and Noelle were worse than her? Good. Then by the time those two were done, McKell might just wish he\u2019d decorated himself with bows and walked into AIR headquarters on his own.</p><p>Two</p><p>He never stopped sharpening his blade.</p><p>Ava Sans watched her target from a few feet away and tried not to drool. Key word: tried. He sat on a large rock in the middle of a government-owned forest. A forest he didn\u2019t have permission to be in. Clearly, following rules wasn\u2019t his thing. Bless his heart, as her mother used to say about anyone in need of spiritual guidance. \u201cAnyone,\u201d of course, had meant everyone. Which had been ironic, since her mother hadn\u2019t been sober a day in her life.</p><p>Concentrate. Golden moonlight framed the target\u2019s back, and a crackling fire illuminated his front. He had pale skin and a face that proved God had an A game. And why the good Lord would have chosen to deviate from that formula and create other faces, she would never know. If everyone looked like this man\u2014like fevered whispers in the dark, forbidden chocolate, and sin in its most tempting incarnation\u2014crime would have ceased long ago. Or maybe never even started. Everyone would have been too busy staring at themselves in the mirror to fight. Or maybe they\u2019d be too busy bedding themselves to even stare in the mirror.</p><p>Seriously. That face was flawless. Everyone always talked about how perfect Dallas Gutierrez was, but this man ... His forehead wasn\u2019t too long or short, his nose was wonderfully straight, his cheekbones delightfully sharp, and his chin magnificently square.</p><p>His bottom lip was plumper than his top, but both were pink and utterly nibbleable. Was that even a word? Anyway. Vivid violet eyes were framed by long feathering lashes, and his black-as-night hair boasted the slightest wave. His shoulders were wide and his body thick, built for war. Which just happened to be her favorite body type; muscles equaled delicious.</p><p>In seconds, she\u2019d memorized every detail about him. For the job. Of course. But the best thing about him, besides that devastating beauty? He wore a necklace made of bones. Human finger bones, from the looks of them. Which meant the case of the missing AIR agent phalanges was solved, at least.</p><p>Why had he taken them?</p><p>Whatever the reason, she wanted a necklace like that for herself. Not only because it would go with all of her outfits, but also because it screamed powerful and just a little insane. One glance at that necklace, and most people would run, too afraid to bother him. They wouldn\u2019t tease him mercilessly for his mistakes and laugh about them days later in front of his AIR peers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ava\u2019s hands curled into fists. Maybe she\u2019d steal the necklace from him after she arrested him. Food for thought.</p><p>What she knew about the man, besides the fact that just looking at him could give a girl an orgasm: He needed to feed\u2014aka drink blood\u2014only once a week. His name was Victor, but McKell, what everyone called him, was his classification. And in layman terms, his classification was \u201cbad motherfucker.\u201d Apparently, he was a warrior. The warrior. Once leader of the entire vampire army and still savage beyond compare. Unless the comparison was with her best friend Noelle. \u201cSavage\u201d was a wee bit mild for Noelle.</p><p>Anyway, Ava had walked into McKell\u2019s makeshift camp a few minutes ago, yet he hadn\u2019t even glanced up from his task. He hadn\u2019t asked her to leave and hadn\u2019t questioned her about her sudden appearance and obviously nefarious intentions.</p> <p>He knew she was here, though. She\u2019d watched his nails grow and sharpen, becoming claws. Yet he didn\u2019t fear her enough to bother with her. Or Noelle, who stood beside her. A mistake, but he\u2019d learn. Everyone did.</p><p>Ava glanced at her friend, fellow (almost) AIR agent, and partner in many (allegedly heinous) crimes, to gauge the girl\u2019s reaction to the man. Noelle, too, stared at him, completely fascinated.</p><p>Fascination was a good look for her. Hell, everything was a good look for her. Bastard wouldn\u2019t stand a chance. Tall, slender, with silky brown hair and velvety gray eyes, Noelle was always the epitome of elegance. Until she opened her mouth. Then she was the epitome of mean. And sarcastic. And rebellious.</p><p>The contradiction intrigued anyone with a pulse.</p><p>Wait. Did vampires even have pulses? Ava suddenly wondered. Were they the living dead? Maybe. What did she know? Okay, so. Rephrase: the contradiction intrigued ... anyone. McKell would be no different.</p> <p>\u201cDibs,\u201d Noelle said in her hoarse, used-to-be-a-smoker voice.</p><p>Ava massaged the back of her neck. \u201cThe fact that he\u2019s a murderous bloodsucker isn\u2019t a deal breaker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith those biceps? No.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze returned to McKell. He was shirtless, his muscles on full display. Those to-die-for biceps\u2014literally to-die-for, since a lot of people had probably watched their lives flash before their eyes while those meaty clubs descended\u2014mouthwatering pectorals, and rope after rope of hard-won abs.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Damn. But since Noelle had already called dibs, Ava would never be allowed to run her hands over that deliciously strong body. Was that a ... tear in her eye? \u201cJust a warning, though. Your name rhymes with his, and I plan to torture you about that forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill not a deal breaker.\u201d</p> <p>Damn her friend\u2019s stubbornness. Stubbornness Ava was intimately acquainted with.</p><p>They\u2019d met years and years ago, after Noelle had been kicked out of every private school in the state and no boardinghouse would take her. Ava had understood the reason why within five seconds of meeting the girl. Noelle\u2019s first day at New Chicago Junior High No. 17, she\u2019d taken one look at dirt-poor Ava and said, \u201cI\u2019m bored and need a project. You\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>Ava, of course, had said, \u201cProject this,\u201d and busted her two front teeth.</p><p>The next day, Noelle had held her down and chopped off her hair. She\u2019d then given Ava a glittery ribbon to style away the damage. And when the principal had arrived a few minutes later, demanding answers, neither had told on the other.</p><p>They\u2019d been inseparable ever since.</p><p>\u201cCan I at least have a feel of him when you\u2019re done?\u201d Five minutes. That\u2019s all she needed. She\u2019d touch every inch of him\u2014if anyone asked, she\u2019d just say she\u2019d frisked him\u2014and then, the next boyfriend she had ... hello pretend vampire. Win, win. Not that she\u2019d had a boyfriend in years. Not that she wanted one in the future. Commitment sucked. But hey, so did McKell. She snickered. Anyway, thumbs up for sex. Which she hadn\u2019t had in a while, either.</p><p>Noelle shrugged. \u201cYou can touch him, but only if you do my laundry for a week.\u201d</p><p>Oh, no. No, no, no. Even the suggestion was cruel. But she said, \u201cI need some think-time.\u201d There was a scar on McKell\u2019s sternum, stretching to his navel and dipping inside his pants, and the thought of tracing it ... maybe she could survive the laundry. That\u2019s craziness.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m kinda pressed for time, so you\u2019ve got two minutes to decide,\u201d Noelle replied. \u201cStarting now.\u201d</p><p>Finally the vampire stopped running those silver blades together. Had he been listening to their conversation, as they\u2019d hoped? Was he now waiting for her think-time to end to discover her answer?</p><p>Two minutes after her two minutes had passed, McKell growled low in his throat. \u201cI\u2019m right here. Stop talking about me as if I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>That voice ... God hadn\u2019t just been on his A game when he created this being. He\u2019d decided to enter a new league. Rough, raspy, and purring, McKell\u2019s voice was like hot butterscotch poured over\u2014hmm, butterscotch. The thought of her favorite candy distracted Ava for a moment.</p><p>Yep. Should have called dibs yourself.</p><p>\u201cWe did,\u201d Ava said, forcing her mind on the task at hand. \u201cWe stopped talking about you. In fact, you had to break the silence. Remember?\u201d</p><p>That earned her a snarl. \u201cJust answer the woman and leave. This is my camp. Mine!\u201d</p><p>Or not have called dibs. Selfish much? \u201cI\u2019ve decided. You can have him,\u201d Ava said to Noelle. \u201cHe\u2019s a little too cranky for me. Besides that, I promised myself I\u2019d take a razor to my wrists before ever doing your laundry again.\u201d She hadn\u2019t minded the blood and gore on the clothes. Why would she, when the same stuff could be found on her own? The problem had been folding the skanky costumes Noelle supposedly liked to wear in the bedroom\u2014in full view of everyone inside Suds and Bubbles Laundromat. Costumes Ava suspected Noelle had purchased only for her benefit and subsequent humiliation.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a prude,\u201d Noelle muttered.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re a pain in my ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? You\u2019re the ass pain!\u201d</p><p>McKell flashed his fangs\u2014long, sharp, and oddly beautiful\u2014before Ava could call her best friend a raging bitch. \u201cBe quiet! Seriously. I preferred the silence.\u201d Then, contradicting his own demand, he asked, \u201cSo what are you doing here, anyway?\u201d</p><p>Mmm, butterscotch. The real deal was too expensive for her to have at every meal, as well as between meals, during the middle of the night, and for all snacks. As she would have preferred. Citywide, sugar was in low supply, the price for it rising every week, it seemed, so she only indulged once a month. Which just happened to be her favorite day of the month. Even if she was on her period.</p><p>His voice, though ... give me a spoonful of that.</p><p>\u201cMind out of the candy bowl,\u201d Noelle said on a sigh. They knew each other too well.</p><p>Right. The vampire had asked a question, and she had a job to do. \u201cWe were just passing through, saw your fire, and thought we\u2019d stop by and make out with each other.\u201d</p><p>His jaw dropped.</p><p>\u201cWanna watch?\u201d Noelle added hopefully.</p><p>\u201cOr maybe join?\u201d Ava suggested.</p><p>\u201cWhatever. We\u2019re not picky.\u201d</p><p>That violet gaze shifted from one to the other, pupils expanding. He licked his lips, tongue pink and wet and, well, pretty. Was everything about the man attractive? Doesn\u2019t matter. Good news: even vampires were perverts.</p><p>She shouldn\u2019t have been surprised, even though a part of her still reeled at the knowledge that vampires existed at all. Sure, Ava had known aliens lived here. They\u2019d walked this planet for over eighty years\u2014and as she was only twenty-three years old, that meant they\u2019d lived here her entire life (duh). All different races, sizes, colors, and shapes.</p><p>In high school she\u2019d dated a Teran for six whole days, and they were a very catlike species. Lots of rubbing and purring and shedding. Too much rubbing and purring and shedding.</p><p>Anyway. Vampires had never revealed themselves, even during the human-alien war, and everyone had assumed they were the stuff of myth and legend. Apparently they\u2019d been living underground for thousands of freaking years. They might have remained a secret forever, even, but AIR had a way of ferreting out the truth.</p><p>\u201cDo you always wear weapons when you plan to make out?\u201d McKell snapped, dragging Ava from her thoughts. God, she had to stop letting herself become distracted. And funny that his gaze seemed directed at her, and her alone, boring past her clothes and her skin and, somehow, into her soul. \u201cDon\u2019t try to tell me you\u2019re unarmed. I can smell the weapons on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, hello. This forest is miles from town, and it\u2019s the dead of night. Of course we\u2019re armed. Plus, my friend is a freak and likes when I rough her up.\u201d</p><p>Noelle snorted. \u201cNo way. You\u2019re the one who likes it rough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease! I\u2019m a fragile flower. You know I like to be treated like a lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not foolish,\u201d McKell interjected, his voice now flat. And yet, somehow that timbre crackled with fury. \u201cYou\u2019re both from AIR. You have to be, despite your ... distractibility. Only agents would be foolish enough to approach me. Again.\u201d</p><p>Distractibility\u2014a nice way of saying they argued too much? Probably. And wasn\u2019t that a shocker? A savage who didn\u2019t want to hurt their feelings. She and Noelle would, of course, use that against him.</p><p>\u201cWe can do this easy, or we can do this hard,\u201d he continued in that same flat, yet furious tone. \u201cLeave, and you can return to Agent Snow just as you arrived. Stay, and you can return to Agent Snow in pieces. Although I\u2019ll keep your fingers for touching what\u2019s mine.\u201d As he spoke, he caressed his necklace. \u201cYour choice.\u201d</p><p>Butterscotch, even while threatening.</p><p>Ava didn\u2019t reach for her pyre-gun or any of her blades. She kept her arms at her sides, hands empty. She and Noelle had to be careful with this one. He could stop time\u2014for them\u2014while moving freely himself. Which meant he could slash their throats, and they wouldn\u2019t know until he restarted the clock.</p><p>\u201cNews flash: we didn\u2019t touch anything that belongs to you,\u201d she said, to keep him talking.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here, aren\u2019t you? So, what\u2019s it to be, girls?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d do it, too. Cut off their fingers without a moment\u2019s hesitation. He was cold, and he was hard, and not in the good way, that she could tell. There was no line he wouldn\u2019t cross to achieve what he wanted. No black and white for him. Only shades of gray.</p><p>Why the hell was he suddenly a thousand times sexier? The dibs system sucked worse than commitment, she decided.</p><p>\u201cDude,\u201d Noelle said. \u201cYou totally stole my line. Ava, did you hear him steal my line? Easy or hard way,\u201d she mocked while pouting. \u201cI had planned to say that to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard, Noelle. At least give him a chance to apologize, though. We do not want a repeat of the last time this happened.\u201d</p><p>A muscle ticked in McKell\u2019s jaw. \u201cDid you also hear what I did to the last three agents who came for me? Ava.\u201d</p><p>Her name on those wicked lips ... delectable. She shivered.</p><p>Noelle splayed her arms, deceptively innocent. \u201cFirst, eyes on me, cowboy. I called dibs. Second, we heard. You ate them. So can I sign up for the feasting now, or would you rather I wait until later?\u201d</p><p>Now those violet eyes widened, confusion swirling in their depths. A common occurrence around the girl.</p><p>\u201cAnd was that a no on watching us make out with each other?\u201d Ava asked. No mercy. No matter how badly she wanted to tongue him.</p><p>His nostrils flared, even as his gaze\u2014which had never left her\u2014traveled over her, lingering in all the right places. Her suddenly pebbling nipples, the now aching apex of her thighs. Goose bumps broke out over her skin, the cool night air blending with the warmth from the campfire and licking over her. Another shiver rocked her.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d she prompted, hating the breathlessness of her voice.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a yes,\u201d he rasped.</p><p>She almost grinned. Typical male. Little did he know, he\u2019d just bought himself a one-way ticket to AIR HQ.</p><p>\u201cExcellent choice! I\u2019ve been dying to put my mouth all over this little morsel for too long. So come here, you sexy piece of sexy goodness, you.\u201d Noelle grabbed Ava by the shoulders and tugged her close, lips lowering to plant a big, wet one.</p><p>Ava made sure to moan really loudly as her hands slid down ... down ... the seeming delicate bumps of Noelle\u2019s spine. She cupped Noelle\u2019s ass with her right hand, made a mental note to inquire what kind of workout program her friend had been doing, then curled the fingers of her left hand\u2014the one farthest away from the vampire\u2014around a tiny pyre-gun stored beneath Noelle\u2019s too-tight jeans.</p><p>\u201cDear God,\u201d McKell said now. Had he expected them to balk at kissing each other, even after offering to do so?</p><p>Without pulling her lips from Noelle\u2019s, she aimed the gun toward him, keeping the barrel flat against her friend, hidden. Then she released Noelle\u2019s ass, let those fingers trace the waist of the jeans, as if desperate to sink down, past her panties and into heat, knowing the vampire\u2019s attention followed, all the while allowing the gun a straight shot.</p><p>She squeezed the trigger.</p><p>A blue beam erupted, lighting up the night, nailing him in the chest, and stunning him in place. Boom. Done. For the next twenty-four hours, he would see and hear everything around him, but be unable to move.</p><p>Too. Easy.</p><p>The kiss ended, and Noelle grinned down at her, all white teeth and smugness. \u201cWow. I really felt your passion for me that time.\u201d</p><p>Ava rolled her eyes as she stuffed the gun back into her friend\u2019s pants. \u201cShut up.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSeriously. How long have you been walking around with this huge crush on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you could handle me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEgomaniac.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNarcissist.\u201d</p><p>Noelle glanced at the unmoving McKell and tsked under her tongue. \u201cWhat an amateur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, right? Mia said he\u2019d be a challenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClearly our idea of a challenge differs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho falls for the lesbian act anymore, anyway?\u201d Ava asked with a disappointed shake of her head.</p> <p>\u201cMen. Always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but this one\u2019s a vampire.\u201d</p><p>Noelle patted the top of Ava\u2019s head as if she were a child. And stupid. \u201cA vampire with a penis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>As if the insects surrounding the camp realized the vampire no longer posed a threat, they began to sing and chirp. Amid the chorus, she and Noelle approached McKell. He still sat upon that rock, still held those blades, only now he was immobile. Both of them crouched so that they were eye-to-eye with him.</p><p>\u201cHe really is beautiful, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Noelle observed.</p> <p>Since Ava wouldn\u2019t be enjoying him anytime soon, she saw no reason to praise him. \u201cHe\u2019s okay, I guess.\u201d God, those eyelashes stretched forever. And up close like this, she could see the flecks of emerald mixed with the violet of his irises. What an odd combination. Odd but gorgeous. Even better, there was a rose tint to his cheeks, as if he was flushed with arousal. For her and only her.</p><p>Noelle patted his cheek, just as she\u2019d done to the top of Ava\u2019s head. \u201cDon\u2019t let this destroy your desire for me, McKell. Like I told you, I called dibs, so if you just cooperate with Mia, you and me will be rolling around in bed before you know it. Well, maybe. You were a very naughty boy, and I\u2019ll need to tame you first.\u201d</p><p>What was AIR going to do with him? Ava wondered. Question him, yes. She knew that. Test his blood, she knew that, too, since certain vampire blood was the only thing that could defeat a deadly alien virus that caused cannibalism in humans. But would they torture him for hurting several agents? Keep him locked up for the rest of his life? Eventually kill him?</p><p>A shame if they did. So pretty. \u201cLet\u2019s discard his weapons and drag him to the car,\u201d she said, straightening. Better to get back to business than consider circumstances she couldn\u2019t hope to change. And shouldn\u2019t want to change.</p><p>\u201cBut he looks so heavy.\u201d Noelle straightened as well, towering over her.</p><p>Most people towered over Ava. She hated it, but no one had invented a way to artificially lengthen legs, so she\u2019d learned to deal. And by \u201cdeal,\u201d she meant she beat anyone who teased her into a bloody pulp. \u201cHence the reason I said drag and not carry.\u201d</p><p>A groan. \u201cWhy not call AIR and have them swoop in to pick him up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we\u2019ll miss our Victory Walk through headquarters.\u201d</p> <p>Indecision played over her friend\u2019s beautiful face. \u201cI do like a good victory walk, but I don\u2019t like the thought of sweating. Oh, I know!\u201d Noelle brightened. \u201cIf you drag him on your own, you can have him. We\u2019ll pretend I never uttered the word dibs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no. I already told you he\u2019s too cranky for me. He\u2019s all yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to get laid more than I do. Your last overnight relationship\u201d\u2014she air-quoted the word relationship\u2014\u201cwas, what? Six months ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven, thank you very much.\u201d And five minutes after the guy had fallen asleep, she\u2019d snuck out. As always. But she\u2019d known then, as she knew now, that having sex with him had been a mistake. He was an AIR trainee like her, and now that all their coworkers knew he\u2019d nailed her\u2014he had a big, stupid mouth\u2014the other guys assumed she was easy, and constantly made a play for their turn.</p><p>How much worse would the situation be if she slept with a criminal? Even so sexy a criminal?</p><p>\u201cLookit. I\u2019m only thinking about your health,\u201d Noelle said. \u201cYou\u2019ve been so tense lately, and\u2014oh, my God! I just had the best idea.\u201d Grinning, she clapped and twirled like a toddler who\u2019d just discovered a room of candy-flavored toys. \u201cLet\u2019s take pictures with him before you drag him to the car.\u201d</p><p>Split-second subject changes were a Noelle Tremain trademark. \u201cNo way. And you\u2019re helping me drag.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring her, Noelle settled on McKell\u2019s lap. \u201cMe first. I plan to tell everyone he\u2019s my new boyfriend. Since he is. Someone, and I won\u2019t mention your name, Ava, is just being stubborn about a little heavy lifting.\u201d</p><p>She was the stubborn one? Ha!</p><p>But she knew when she was beaten. Noelle wouldn\u2019t budge until she had her pictures. Sighing, Ava withdrew her cell and captured a few images while her friend switched poses. Over and over again. If she wasn\u2019t mistaken, murderous rage blazed in McKell\u2019s eyes the entire time. Way to poke at the bear. And yet she never stopped snapping those pictures. And not because of Noelle.</p><p>One, McKell was completely edible on film. Something a guy like him had to appreciate. And two, once AIR had him, she probably wouldn\u2019t see him again and definitely wouldn\u2019t be able to point at him and say, \u201cGuess what? I bagged and tagged him,\u201d to other agents.</p><p>Now she could say the words, and when those agents replied, \u201cThere\u2019s no way a shortie like you could have taken down a hulking vampire like McKell,\u201d she could bust out the photos. Everyone would be impressed. They\u2019d stop looking at gutter-raised, baby-faced Ava like she needed to be in a kitchen baking cakes\u2014or in bed waiting for a man and charging two hundred an hour.</p><p>\u201cAll right. We\u2019ve got enough pictures to fill a scrapbook. Let\u2019s do this,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanna go home. I\u2019m starved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll help carry. But FYI, you\u2019re always starved,\u201d Noelle muttered, frisking the vampire and tossing his weapons to the ground.</p><p>For some reason, the fury in his eyes increased from I-could-explode-and-kill-you-both murderous to I-could-explode-and-take-out-the-entire-world nuclear. As if removing his guns and knives was a far worse crime than capturing lifelong images of his shame spiral.</p><p>\u201cDone,\u201d Noelle said, unaware of the change. She slid her arms under his right armpit. \u201cHe\u2019s now clean.\u201d</p><p>Ava did the same to his left armpit, wholly aware yet unwilling to let it detour her. \u201cWhat do you mean, I\u2019m always starved? What are you trying to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry. I thought I made that clear. I was saying you eat too much, and maybe you should have rethought the miniskirt tonight.\u201d</p><p>They hefted his big, heavy body up, and her biceps immediately began to shake.</p><p>\u201cI look fat to you?\u201d All hundred and twenty pounds of her? Most of which was muscle, if she were being (kind of) honest. Damn, that irresistible butterscotch. She ran her tongue over her teeth, even though she knew Noelle was prodding her only to energize her. \u201cOh, poor thing, I think one of your contacts has slipped. Let me help.\u201d With her free hand, she slapped her friend on the back of the head. Hard.</p><p>\u201cOw! I don\u2019t wear contacts, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom lover to fighter,\u201d Noelle said with a dejected sigh. \u201cSad, really, that you let our romance die so quickly.\u201d</p><p>Ava bit her lip to stop herself from laughing. What a great day this had turned out to be, she thought. And really, it was only going to get better.</p><p>How could it not?</p><p>Three</p><p>As the females tugged him through dirt and leaves, occasionally dropping him, tearing his pants, his skin, kicking him once out of spite because he \u201ccould stand to lose a few pounds,\u201d McKell seethed.</p><p>Puny humans. Taunt him, would they? Take pictures of him in this hated state, would they? Take his weapons, would they? He, who didn\u2019t share anything. Ever! And that wasn\u2019t the worst of their crimes. Kiss in front of him and not finish what they\u2019d started, would they?</p><p>They would learn the error of their ways. Soon. He would teach them, as they\u2019d just taught him.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t expected them to follow through with their \u201cdesire\u201d to kiss each other. Much as he\u2019d wished otherwise. Neither had smelled of lust, so he\u2019d known the pretend affection was for his benefit. He\u2019d expected them to lean in, then launch themselves at him just before contact. That\u2019s what he\u2019d prepared himself for. That\u2019s when he would have frozen them in place and drank from them one at a time before sending them back to AIR, defeated and humiliated.</p><p>When they had kissed, he\u2019d been momentarily blinded by lust of his own. The dainty hands of the tiny one, roving over the Amazon\u2019s body ... his blood had heated, singeing his veins. He\u2019d suddenly wanted those hands on him. Roving over his body.</p><p>Suddenly? Liar. He\u2019d imagined touching her since the first moment he\u2019d spied her. Which had been a shock. Humans were food to him, nothing more, and a man didn\u2019t play with his food. Honestly, he shouldn\u2019t have wanted her\u2014Ava, that was her name, and it was as soft and delicate as she appeared\u2014in any way. Not even as sustenance.</p><p>He\u2019d gorged only an hour before her arrival, and should have been satisfied for the next six days. But the moment she\u2019d entered his camp, he\u2019d smelled her\u2014orchids, sunlight he\u2019d loathed until that moment, and some kind of sugary candy completely unique to her\u2014and his mouth had watered. His shaft had ached. He was absolutely certain he\u2019d smelled something as decadent at some point in his long, long life, though he couldn\u2019t recall when or what.</p><p>His reaction was explainable, though. He\u2019d been without a vampire lover for months, so his body would have lusted after anything. So why didn\u2019t you want the tall one who called \u201cdibs\u201d?</p><p>What a ridiculous question. He hadn\u2019t lusted after the one named Noelle because she reminded him too much of his own kind, and right now he was furious with all vampires and would rather kill a bloodsucker than screw one.</p><p>He ignored the flaw between the two rationales. And what the hell was \u201cdibs,\u201d anyway? He\u2019d visited this surface world many times before being kicked from the vampire caves, but he\u2019d never heard the term. Was it some type of ownership? Probably. The females seemed to think he now belonged to Noelle.</p><p>Well, he belonged to no one. The only female he would have bound himself to was Maureen, known here as Bride McKells, but she\u2019d chosen to give herself to another. To Devyn, king of the Targons. As if McKell weren\u2019t good enough. As if he wasn\u2019t a thousand times better than that bastard Targon scum. McKell had slaughtered entire vampire villages in less than an hour. With no aid! He was good enough for anyone.</p><p>Even Ava, who hadn\u2019t wanted to do Noelle\u2019s laundry to be with him. Laundry\u2014the washing of clothes, for God\u2019s sake\u2014when there were hundreds of vampires who would have been willing to cut out their own hearts to even touch the dirt on his boots. Well, maybe not hundreds. Thousands was probably more accurate, he decided in the next instant, refusing to give in to self-deprecation. He was a prize, damn it!</p><p>Even still, now he just wanted to be on his own, left alone, with time to come to grips with the horrid topside eternity that awaited him. And in a hundred years or so, he should be able to say, \u201cmission accomplished.\u201d Maybe.</p><p>All he knew now was that he hated this world. The sun, burning his beautiful skin and ruining part of his day every damn day. The cloying scents of human food and perfume. AIR constantly trying to \u201cchat.\u201d Annoying.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Noelle. Put your back into it!\u201d Ava said, irritated.</p><p>\u201cI am, damn it! But I can\u2019t help it if I\u2019m not strong enough to lug around this much dead weight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a hundred pounds heavier than me. You should be running laps around me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hundred pounds? You bitch! You better watch your back, because I will punish you for that whopper.\u201d</p><p>Clearly, they despised each other. He\u2019d dealt with humans all the many centuries of his life, stealing them from this surface and carting them underground to keep them as food-slaves. Most argued, yes, but only enemies had argued like these two, calling each other hateful names, complaining, kissing\u2014uh, never mind that last one. That devastating kiss had no bearing on the situation. What did: he could use their dislike of each other to his advantage.</p><p>\u201cYou once pushed me and the weights you\u2019d tied around my waist into oncoming traffic,\u201d Ava growled. \u201cYou\u2019re strong enough for this. You\u2019re just lazy!\u201d</p><p>Noelle had once tried to kill Ava? That, he didn\u2019t like for some reason. But he wouldn\u2019t worry about that now. She meant nothing to him. Well, except maybe breakfast.</p><p>\u201cYour brain has clearly rotted,\u201d Noelle snarled. \u201cI\u2019m as lazy as Mia Snow on steroids, adrenaline injections, and caffeine overload.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me kick your ass.\u201d</p><p>Would they ever kiss again? he wondered, then scowled. No, they wouldn\u2019t kiss again, because he was going to murder them both. If they didn\u2019t kill each other first. Which seemed highly likely. They were predators, both of them, and they\u2019d probably scratch each other to death if they ever got into bed. An arousing thought. An irritating thought, since they didn\u2019t deserve a single moment of pleasure.</p><p>\u201cI swear to God I\u2019m going to stab you in your heartless chest with a butter knife if you don\u2019t\u2014oh, good. I see the car,\u201d Ava said with relief. \u201cAct like my friend for five more minutes and actually help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave I told you yet that you\u2019re a bitch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019ve been too busy tilting McKell so that I\u2019d have to take the brunt of his weight.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He liked Ava\u2019s voice. Smooth, as deceptively sweet as her face. A face that was slightly rounded, with big brown eyes, an up-tilted nose, and heart-shaped lips. A face better suited for angelic paintings, and yet midnight fantasies were what claimed his mind every time he looked at her. And framing all that sweetness was an even sweeter tumble of amber curls. Curls made for fisting, tugging, pinning so that she would be forced to take the hottest flames of his kiss.</p><p>Only thing that wasn\u2019t sweet about her\u2014besides her demeanor\u2014was her body.</p><p>What she lacked in height, she made up for in curves. She had breasts that strained the white tank top she wore, a waist that flared beneath a dangerously short skirt, and sun-kissed legs encased in calf-high boots.</p> <p>\u201cMoment he comes out of stun,\u201d Noelle huffed, \u201cI\u2019m breaking up with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I don\u2019t get to sing about Noelle and McKell sitting in a tree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up. Anyway, I can\u2019t be with a man who can\u2019t find a way out of stun to help me carry him. It\u2019s discourteous, you know? And selfish.\u201d</p><p>Her babbling made no sense. What an odd woman.</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Ava said.</p> <p>She understood that nonsense? Just you wait, he thought darkly.</p><p>When the females pulled him out of the line of trees and into a clearing, he froze them in place with only a thought. Their minds, their bodies. They were stunned, like him, only they had no idea what happened around them.</p><p>Inside, he grinned. Everyone assumed he could stop time, and they were right. He could stop the clock for several minutes at a time. But that wasn\u2019t all he could do. He could also stop the people around him while time passed without their knowledge. And that\u2019s exactly what he did now.</p><p>He held his captors in place for one hour ... two. He should have grown bored, simply staring ahead as he was, but too much relish filled him. Oh, yes, these females would learn. He knew this area, knew the forest itself was gated to keep humans out, and knew no one would stumble upon them.</p><p>They were his.</p><p>Ava ... his ... Down boy, he thought with a growl. To think of her in such a possessive way was to undermine his plan for her. And he\u2014</p> <p>McKell cursed as he noticed a shimmering curtain of air to his right. A doorway. The air had thickened, dust motes glowing in the moonlight, a tangible glitter that somehow looked like welcoming arms. Not again. He\u2019d seen such a doorway every time he\u2019d visited this topside world.</p><p>In fact, he\u2019d seen one yesterday, and the day before, and the day before that. Once and only once had he been tempted to touch. He\u2019d reached out, but that dappled air had sucked at him, pulling him closer against his will, trying to swallow him up. He\u2019d raced backward, warrior instincts saving him\u2014sometimes you fought, sometimes you retreated, always you returned later and killed\u2014and the suction had ceased. But he\u2019d never forgotten the experience, and never wanted a repeat.</p><p>How did you fight a split in the ether? Especially when that split might be sentient.</p><p>Deep down, he thought he knew where the doorway, or whatever it was, led, what it wanted. The answers? To eternal darkness and his damnation. Why target him, though, he wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>Pay it no heed and it will go away. As always. He released the women from his mental hold.</p><p>No longer fettered, Ava and Noelle continued forward, unaware anything had changed and thankfully avoiding the curtain. Though he knew they couldn\u2019t see it. Only he could. Over the years, he\u2019d watched humans, otherworlders, and vampires alike walk through them, as if the air were merely that. Air.</p><p>When they had passed the curtain and adjusted to the fading darkness, he froze them in place once again. Another hour, then two, passed quickly for him. Thankfully, another doorway never opened.</p><p>Again he released them for only a moment, let them continue with their chat, move forward, adjust, before refreezing them.</p> <p>Another hour. This one eked by. But finally, he let them go for good.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, my arms are burning,\u201d Ava rasped. \u201cAnd shaking, too. I feel like I\u2019ve held him for days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too. And damn, the sun\u2019s coming out already. We\u2019re slower than I realized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it. Hurry.\u201d</p><p>Obviously exhausted, they hauled him the rest of the way, tripping and cursing, and stashed him inside the waiting vehicle.</p><p>\u201cHis skin will burn if we leave him like this. Right? Didn\u2019t Mia tell us vampires are sensitive to light?\u201d Ava stood in his open doorway, peering down at him and tapping a blunt-tipped finger against her chin.</p><p>Not for a moment did he delude himself into thinking she truly cared about keeping him unharmed.</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d Noelle said.</p><p>\u201cSo. Mia will be pissed if we bring her damaged goods. Let\u2019s cover him.\u201d</p><p>Good thing he hadn\u2019t deluded himself. He would have been feeling supremely disappointed just then. Which he wasn\u2019t. Not even a little.</p><p>Damn her. He was a vampire, far superior to a measly human, and he deserved her admiration and consideration.</p><p>\u201cShame to cover up that face, though.\u201d With a sigh, Noelle tossed a blanket over his head. The material draped his bare shoulders and torso, protecting him from the sun\u2019s rapidly strengthening rays. \u201cHappy now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCranky as the vampire now?\u201d</p><p>Muttering curses at each other, they settled into the front of the car. He heard one of them push a series of buttons on the dash. A second later, the air conditioner blasted. Before either female could program the car to return to AIR, however, McKell froze them in place. And this time, he didn\u2019t bother releasing them every few hours to keep them from suspecting he was manipulating them. He simply allowed the hours to pass, the sun rising, heating, ruining what should have been the best part of the day.</p><p>Hour after hour after hour passed, washing him in gold, then orange, then a hazy pink. Finally, blessedly, that hated sun began to wane, dulling even the pink light seeping through the fabric of the blanket. By the time darkness once again surrounded him, the stun had worn off, freeing his muscles from immobility.</p><p>Vengeance.</p><p>Scowling, McKell tossed the blanket aside. A moment ticked by as his gaze accustomed itself to the open space. He saw that Ava and Noelle were in their seats, Noelle\u2019s hand raised to push more buttons, Ava\u2019s deep in a bag, as if she\u2019d been digging through the contents.</p><p>What had she been searching for?</p><p>He couldn\u2019t lean forward and check as he wanted. Clear, impenetrable shield-armor divided the front and back of the car. That wouldn\u2019t be a problem, but breaking through it would take longer than he was willing to spend. He glanced at the door beside him. No handles.</p><p>The car, he knew, would only obey Ava and Noelle\u2019s commands. If they said, \u201cOpen,\u201d the door would pop open automatically, since it was programmed to recognize and obey their voices, but he wasn\u2019t about to free either female yet. At the moment, surprise was his best friend. So McKell did the only thing he could\u2014he kicked the door off its hinges and unfolded from the backseat, a move that allowed him to exit just as quickly as if the car had catered to his voice.</p><p>Cool night air wafted around him, bringing with it the scents of pine, night birds, and seductive moonlight. He stretched, his abused body protesting every movement, and that intensified his anger.</p><p>So angry was he, in fact, that he slashed his claws into Ava\u2019s door with more force than necessary, letting them embed deeply before ripping the offending block out of the way. The metal soared over his shoulder, landing with a heavy thud behind him. Then Ava was in front of him, nothing preventing him from ripping her out, as well.</p><p>\u201cI warned you,\u201d he growled at her, even though he knew she couldn\u2019t hear him. \u201cEasy or hard, and you picked hard.\u201d Rather than slash her to pieces, however, he crouched beside her and grabbed the bag.</p><p>Motions still stiff, he rifled through the contents. Different sized blades. A badge that read \u201cAgent in Training.\u201d His eyes widened. In training? She was merely in training? AIR had sent a child after him? God, the insult. Almost enough to send him racing to their base, destroying every brick, every human inside, just to prove that he could.</p><p>Don\u2019t lose focus. He could rant about their insolence later.</p><p>Teeth grinding, he continued his search of little Ava\u2019s bag. Lastly, he found \u201cbutterscotch\u201d-flavored lipgloss. Butterscotch. Not something he was familiar with.</p><p>He twisted the cap and sniffed the contents, and his mouth instantly watered. That\u2019s what Ava smelled like. Sugary, warm, and toasted in the sun. All the things he suddenly wanted to be. The desire was foreign, unwelcome, and not to be tolerated. He wasn\u2019t some callow youth, so easily swayed by sexual urges. He\u2019d had countless lovers over the centuries, and knew how fleeting those urges could be. How meaningless. He couldn\u2019t even recall a face or a name of one of the women who had warmed his bed. Cold of him, perhaps, but for a man with his sense of possession, he had always purposefully maintained distance in that area of his life.</p><p>He stuffed Ava\u2019s gloss in his pocket\u2014to torment her with its loss, he told himself, and not because he wanted a reminder of her, of her scent, of the hunger she elicited\u2014then tossed the bag and the rest of its contents behind him. Then he focused on Ava.</p><p>Her curls fell over her shoulders, shiny and\u2014he pinched several between his fingers\u2014soft as ocher velvet. Moonlight caressed her, turning her flawless skin to liquid gold. He traced the back of his knuckle along the curve of her cheek, far more gently than he\u2019d meant. That, too, was soft. Would be a shame to mar her, he decided, then frowned. She was already marred. There were several scars running the length of her arms, and many crisscrossing her hands.</p><p>He lifted each hand, studying. Too many scars for such a young, \u201cin training\u201d agent. Besides, though some of those scars were clearly newer than others, none were pink and fresh. Which meant she\u2019d been fighting most of her obviously short life. McKell wasn\u2019t sure if that disturbed him, aroused him, or amused him.</p><p>Scowling again, he slid one arm around her lower back and one under her legs. He carried her a short distance from the car and lay her down, careful, so careful not to jostle. He did the same with Noelle, only he dropped her flat on her ass. Why the difference in treatment, he didn\u2019t know. Didn\u2019t care to ponder. Then he proceeded to rip the vehicle to pieces, just as he\u2019d promised to do to the girls, piling the remains around them, forming a wall. A reminder of their failure with him.</p><p>When he finished, he was panting, covered in a sheen of perspiration, his anger somewhat dimmed. Still. He was tracing his tongue over his fangs, some other unnameable emotion humming inside him as he rejoined the humans and removed their clothing. Noelle was first, and he stripped her without pause. Ava, however, he found himself lingering over, every new inch revealing a deeper appreciation of her femininity and his wavering restraint.</p><p>White lace bra. Front clasp. Nice. Her breasts were lush, with nipples that were the color of honey-dipped apples. Her belly was flat, with a navel that hollowed perfectly. A tongue could lose itself in that navel. White lace underwear. Ribboned on the sides. Only needed a tug to unlace them ... Really nice. Her thighs were firm, the apex guarded by a tiny triangle of amber curls.</p><p>When he finished, he realized pure temptation lay before him.</p><p>She\u2019s human, he reminded himself. Weak, withering. Food.</p><p>Still. He couldn\u2019t leave her naked, he decided. If she were to stumble upon a male, that male would want her. Obviously. That male would probably try to \u201chit on her,\u201d as the humans said. She would rebuff him. McKell knew this only because the thought of her accepting returned the plumes of rage. And when her tart tongue finished rebuffing, the male would fight her, as pride demanded. The two would roll around on the ground, and the male\u2019s penis might accidentally slip inside her. McKell couldn\u2019t risk it. Not because he cared who the woman slept with, that wasn\u2019t why he raged, he rationalized, but because, again, she didn\u2019t deserve pleasure. Not that she\u2019d find pleasure from her attacker.</p><p>His teeth gnashed together. Again, he refused to acknowledge the flaw in his reasoning.</p><p>He put Ava\u2019s bra and panties back on her, then reluctantly did the same for her ... friend. Enemy. Whatever. That done, he pocketed Ava\u2019s phone and again peered down at the curly-haired witch. Beautiful.</p><p>Shove your tongue back into your mouth, and finish what you started. He forced all thoughts of touching and tasting from his mind, and withdrew the gloss he\u2019d stolen from her. Then, he began writing directly on her body.</p><p>When he finished, he was actually trembling from the effort to resist doing more to her.</p><p>In a few days, when he\u2019d gotten his desires under control, he would find her again, he decided. He\u2019d use her as she had planned to use him. Because, if he liked her scent, connoisseur that he was, other vampires would, too. They would be drawn to her, would want to drink from her. And rather than having to track them down himself, as he\u2019d had to do before AIR had started gunning for him, distracting him, they would come to him.</p><p>Now they ran from him, scared of him. But if they were preoccupied with Ava, he would have no trouble grabbing them. Finally he could question them and discover how they lived here. How they survived in that wretched sun.</p><p>Yes, he liked this plan.</p><p>Ava wouldn\u2019t, though, he thought, and he was grinning as he strode away.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Ava gasped out. One moment she\u2019d been inside the car, searching for her lipgloss, the sun fighting its way into the sky. She hadn\u2019t moved, only a second had passed, yet now she was outside, the night thick and dark, an almost suffocating cloak.</p><p>And holy hell, the car was in shambles around her, claw marks slashing through the metal.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in our undies!\u201d Noelle squeaked beside her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ava jackknifed to her feet, knees almost giving out as she peered down at herself. No top, no skirt, no shoes. Only her bra and matching panties.</p><p>Shit. She searched, but there was no sign of her clothes. \u201cThat tricky bastard! He did this.\u201d And she floundered between admiration, humiliation, and horror. The strength required to destroy a car like that ... immense. The intelligence required to outwit her ... equally so. But God, the knowledge that she\u2019d failed, choking.</p><p>What else had he done?</p> <p>Frantically she patted her neck. Thank the Lord. No puncture wounds. Still. There was no question McKell had defeated her just as surely as he\u2019d defeated the other agents sent after him. She\u2019d been so cocky, so certain of her success. After all, she hadn\u2019t lost a fight since Judy Demarko, the world\u2019s biggest seventh-grade bully, had slammed her head into a brick wall and hacked off her hair\u2014why did girls always do that to her?\u2014while she was too dazed to move. All because Judy\u2019s ex-boyfriend had asked her out. Well, and maybe because Ava had stashed Onadyn, an illegal alien drug, in Judy\u2019s bag the day before, getting her kicked out of school, her reign of terror finally over. But that was merely speculation.</p><p>\u201cI thought he could only stop time in short bursts,\u201d Noelle said. She stood, as well, and tossed up her arms, the picture of exasperated female. \u201cYet he clearly stopped us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means you thought wrong.\u201d Ava, too.</p><p>\u201cThanks for stating the obvious. You\u2019re lucky I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d Noelle gasped.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ava whipped left and right, scanning the forest for any sign of intruders. They were alone, the insects as quiet as they\u2019d been around McKell. The scent of him lingered, though, as if he\u2019d only just left. Warm, intoxicating ... necessary.</p> <p>Oh, hell, no. She hadn\u2019t just thought that word. Necessary. She wiped it from her vernacular.</p><p>The gasp turned to giggles, and Noelle pointed to her chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she demanded again, looking down and seeing something golden\u2014letters, she realized\u2014smeared on her skin, just above her bra. She frowned, sniffed. Butterscotch. Mmm. Her stomach rumbled. \u201cWhat does it say?\u201d</p><p>Noelle just grinned at her.</p><p>She tilted her head, trying to decipher all four of those letters. When she did, she gnashed her molars in irritation. And more admiration, damn it, followed by a stupid wave of giddiness.</p><p>McKell had taken her lipgloss and spelled the word DIBS.</p> <p>Four</p><p>The next morning, the gun range overflowed with agents, and Ava resigned herself to a half-hour wait. At least. But Mia arrived a few minutes later\u2014two minutes early for their meeting, God bless her\u2014and three stalls immediately cleared, the agents scampering away without meeting their commander\u2019s eye. Now that was power.</p><p>Ava envied her.</p><p>Mia claimed the middle, and Ava and Noelle the sides.</p><p>In unison, they withdrew and loaded crystals into their pyre-guns, checking the chambers for obstructions while techs placed flame-resistant dummies at the end of the stalls.</p><p>Apparently, Mia was a multitasker and liked to conduct her chew-outs while at target practice. Only, as they fired golden beams at the dummies, soot forming where they hit, there was only silence.</p><p>Was Mia too pissed to speak?</p><p>Ava looked at the woman\u2019s target. Three shots to the fake man\u2019s chest. She looked at Noelle\u2019s. Three shots to the face. Then she looked at her own. Three shots to the groin. No, Mia wasn\u2019t pissed. Otherwise her dummy would have resembled Noelle\u2019s or Ava\u2019s. This was just business as usual. And wasn\u2019t that a shocker.</p> <p>Still. Ava knew this meeting would not end well for her. How could it? After last night\u2019s failure, Mia would forbid her to approach McKell. To punish him as she craved. To assuage her curiosity and discover what he\u2019d do next. To tamp down her need to peer into those violet eye and ... what? She didn\u2019t know.</p><p>She only knew the desire to see him again was strong. So, would she obey an edict to stay away? She didn\u2019t know that, either. The man had her cell, and more than anything, she wanted it back. Liar.</p><p>Okay, okay. Most of all she wanted to get her hands on him and, uh, choke him. Yeah. Choke him. He\u2019d been way too smug about his victory, writing on her chest like that, then leaving her practically naked. What a show-off. He should be ashamed. Poor sportsmanship always earned a penalty, and choking would be his.</p><p>\u201cSo ...\u201d she began, aiming at her target. Of course, she once again pictured McKell\u2019s beautiful features as she squeezed the trigger. Had he truly been standing at the end of her stall, his stomach would have exploded that time. \u201cWe gonna kick this thing off or what?\u201d</p><p>Because they were using pyre-guns, background noise wasn\u2019t a problem. Pyres were as quiet as little church mice.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t realize you were a masochist.\u201d Mia exchanged her crystal for a bigger one. The bigger the crystal, the hotter the burn. Working off her stress? Looking at her, that seemed implausible. Even with her obviously violent nature, she resembled a ballerina, not a trained assassin. Black hair, blue eyes. A face more delicate than Ava\u2019s.</p><p>Despite that face, Mia had earned the respect and yeah, fear of her peers. When she spoke, they listened. They trusted her to lead them properly, intelligently. They saw her strength, saw the spirit of the alpha that lurked at her core. Ava wanted that for herself. Craved it like a drug.</p><p>\u201cThere are probably a lot of things you don\u2019t know about my girl Ava,\u201d Noelle said to their boss. She\u2019d never been one to back down from anyone. \u201cLike, she enjoys long walks on the beach, cuddling in front of a fireplace, and a new favorite, being written on with butterscotch-flavored lipgloss.\u201d</p><p>Mia\u2019s lips curved slightly, the echoes of winter in her eyes almost melting to summer. \u201cThat\u2019s inside info that will come in handy, I\u2019m sure. But to be honest, I didn\u2019t command you here so you could listen to me bitch. You did better than any of my other agents, engaging the vampire rather than trying to sneak up on him. You made contact. You weren\u2019t drained. You kept your fingers. Three points for you.\u201d</p><p>Wait. Praise? From the iceberg known as Mia Snow? Amazing. But ... \u201cContact or not, we failed,\u201d Ava said. She wouldn\u2019t dress that fact in bows and lace. One, two, three, she nailed pretend McKell in quick succession. Heart, groin again, and inner thigh. Where it might be nice to kiss him. Argh. Kiss him? Idiot!</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, I know you failed,\u201d Mia replied. Four bright golden beams shot from her gun. All hit the same shoulder, deepening what would have been an injury, not a death sentence. \u201cBut it could have been worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure how.\u201d McKell had destroyed their ride and stolen their clothes, so she and Noelle had had to walk to the nearest convenience store, commandeer T-shirts and bandanas\u2014all that had been available\u2014and hitch home. The male driver had leered at their legs the entire way.</p><p>Funny thing, though. She\u2019d felt utterly safe. And not just because she knew how to protect herself with a skill and precision, and hell, a determination, not many regular citizens realized. She\u2019d felt something with her, a presence, a dark storm, scaring away the bad, yet never turning on her.</p><p>The vampire? Surely not. He\u2019d had his fun, and he\u2019d slipped away in the night.</p><p>Mia fired off another shot. \u201cLike I said, you weren\u2019t drained and sent back to me useless.\u201d</p><p>Fine. A kind-of success. But kind-of wasn\u2019t good enough for Ava. Especially since she had a feeling McKell had failed to drink their blood because they were women, and he had a weakness\u2014otherwise known as a conscience\u2014rather than their superior agenting skills.</p><p>\u201cPlus,\u201d Mia continued, and it was apparent she was trying not to laugh. \u201cWe now know McKell can do more than simply stop time. He can stop people. And strip them. And write on them.\u201d</p><p>Noelle snickered.</p><p>Ava flipped off both women.</p><p>Mia shrugged, probably used to such a reaction. \u201cNow you\u2019re better equipped to deal with him.\u201d</p><p>Better equipped to\u2014Wait. What? \u201cSo you\u2019re giving us another chance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never doubted you would,\u201d Noelle said, which was funny, since she had whined about the \u201cinjustice of being fired for one strike-out\u201d the entire drive here.</p><p>\u201cGood. Now listen closely.\u201d Mia slapped her gun on the counter, then pinned them both with a hard glare. \u201cI need a blood sample from him, and I don\u2019t care how you get it. I have questions for him, too, but those can wait. Blood\u2019s the most important thing right now. We found another Sch\u00f6n victim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDead?\u201d Ava asked. She knew the Sch\u00f6n disease worked quickly, turning the infected men and women into cannibals while the virus itself ate through their bodies. But there hadn\u2019t been a new case in weeks. And before that, Bride McKells had used her blood to heal the infected. So they had a cure. Right?</p><p>Just the name, Bride McKells, irritated Ava. Bride had married Devyn, king of the Targons, but had once been engaged to Ava\u2019s McKell.</p><p>Wait. Hold everything. McKell wasn\u2019t Ava\u2019s. Would never be Ava\u2019s. Her hands fisted. He was a case, nothing more. And she wasn\u2019t jealous that the vampire had pined for the female for decades, waiting for her to return to their underground world and live happily-ever-after.</p><p>There was more to the story, there had to be\u2014because really, what kind of woman picked cocky Devyn Targon over brooding Victor McKell?\u2014but that was all Ava had found in the vampire\u2019s file. Had he loved Bride? If so, did he love her still?</p><p>Ava\u2019s nails sliced into skin. Doesn\u2019t matter. Relax. He was nothing. Not to her.</p><p>Mia nodded, cropped black hair dancing over her shoulders. \u201cOne vic means there will be other vics. That\u2019s the way it works. And yeah, Bride Targon\u2019s blood heals the infected, we think, but we\u2019ve basically tapped her dry, and Devyn\u2019s ... complaining. We want to test McKell now.\u201d</p><p>As fierce and lethal as Devyn was, Ava would bet that \u201ccomplaining\u201d involved knives.</p><p>\u201cTell me I can count on you,\u201d Mia finished. A demand.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be stupid not to,\u201d Noelle said. A boast.</p><p>\u201cVery true,\u201d Ava agreed. How she\u2019d get that sample, she didn\u2019t yet know. She\u2019d find a way, though. She always did.</p><p>Smile returning, Mia patted Ava\u2019s ass. \u201cGood. So go get your man, tiger.\u201d</p><p>McKell\u2019s heartbeat sped up the moment Ava stepped past the line of trees and into his camp, stopping in front of the campfire exactly as she had the night before.</p><p>She had returned. He hadn\u2019t had to chase her down.</p><p>The other girl, Noelle, eased up beside her, but his gaze remained on Ava. She wore a skin-tight black shirt and equally tight black pants. Her curls had been tamed, forced into some kind of twist at the base of her beautiful neck.</p><p>He wanted to strip her again, find out if she\u2019d washed his claiming away. He wanted to set those curls free, find out if fisting them would give him as much satisfaction as he suspected. But most of all, he wanted to sink his fangs into her vein and taste her blood. Would it taste as sweet as her lipgloss?</p><p>He\u2019d long since given up trying to fight the desires.</p><p>Last night, he had ensured she returned home safely, following in the shadows, even when she rode in some stranger\u2019s car. The stranger in question was alive now only because he\u2019d kept his hands to himself. By the time McKell returned to this forest, distance between him and Ava, his needs had been stronger than ever, and he\u2019d realized he had already lost the battle.</p><p>Had she not come to him tonight, as he\u2019d hoped, he would have gone to her tomorrow rather than waiting a few days. He hadn\u2019t wanted to seem too eager, but he was determined to have her. And not just to use her to lure other vampires.</p><p>\u201cNo kiss this time?\u201d he asked, hoping he\u2019d managed to mask that hated eagerness.</p><p>He sat on the same boulder he\u2019d occupied last night. Difference was, his weapons were now stored in places the girls wouldn\u2019t think to look. Since darkness had fallen, he\u2019d been too distracted, watching for Ava, to even pretend to clean them.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head, causing moonlight and shadows to fight for dominance on her delicate features. \u201cYou\u2019ve been a bad, naughty boy, and don\u2019t deserve a reward.\u201d</p><p>Her voice ... as close to sex as a man could get without actually removing his clothing. Sure, he\u2019d considered it \u201csweet\u201d before. After lying in his cave all day, replaying their interaction through his head over and over again, however, he\u2019d realized that sweet obviously equaled dirty to his body. \u201cI did nothing to you that you didn\u2019t deserve. So a bad, naughty boy? Ha! You, though ... you took my weapons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you got them back.\u201d</p><p>So she wasn\u2019t going to apologize for her actions? \u201cNo one takes my things, Ava. Ever. They are mine. Mine.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, his growing rage clearly of no consequence to her. \u201cWhaa, whaa, whaa, and heard it all before. As if that was the worst of my crimes.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cWhy are you here? You can\u2019t defeat me, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know no such thing,\u201d Noelle replied. She was still here? \u201cBut we\u2019re here because we want to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>She did, perhaps, but Ava clearly did not. That female wanted to shoot him. Anger now filled those dark eyes.</p><p>McKell couldn\u2019t help himself, wanted to stoke the anger into rage. While she watched, he withdrew her lipgloss from his pocket and coated his mouth. He smacked for good measure. But rather than launch herself at him as he\u2019d expected, she smothered a laugh.</p><p>Baffling woman. He\u2019d just taunted her about her failure with him, and she\u2019d gifted him with amusement that stroked his ears. Why hadn\u2019t her anger intensified? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good color for you.

Before we start chatting, I want my phone back,\u201d she said, crossing her arms over her chest. \u201cNo one takes my things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s mine now, and you know I keep what\u2019s mine.\u201d There were hundreds of pictures stored in that phone, and he hadn\u2019t finished scrolling through them. Well, hadn\u2019t finished his third scroll-through.</p><p>It was just, the camera loved her, paying that angel-face nothing but tribute, highlighting the luminous sheen of her skin, the rosy glow in her cheeks, the sparkle in her eyes, turning the brown to melted chocolate and golden glitter. And, well, he\u2019d learned so much about her. Things he\u2019d needed to know since they were at war and he planned to drink from her and use her\u2014not because he was curious about her, the woman. Of course.</p> <p>She clearly liked posing next to Noelle while Noelle looked her worst and was not happy about being photographed. Which proved she was delightfully vindictive. There were also action shots someone else had taken, since Ava\u2019s hands had been occupied punching different sets of teeth. Which proved she was deliciously feral.</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t have been impressed by those facts. He shouldn\u2019t have been aroused. But he was.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wrestle you for it,\u201d she suggested. \u201cNo-rules wrestling, at that, where hands are permitted to roam anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Tempting. To have her hands on him, squeezing at him, her body pressed against his ... To have his hands on her, not just squeezing but kneading, his body not just pressed against hers but pinning ...</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He couldn\u2019t wrestle one girl and freeze the other. Well, he could, but Ava would distract him, so he\u2019d forget to hold Noelle in place, and then the agent (in fucking training) would attack him. He had a feeling his hands would be too full of Ava for his brain to care about protecting his body.</p> <p>Why did she entice him so intently? She was beautiful, yes, but other women were more so. At least, he was certain someone out there was, though he had yet to meet her. And why did his mouth continue to water for Ava, even though he wasn\u2019t legitimately hungry?</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said on a sigh. \u201cForget the phone. We\u2019ll just jump right into our chat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re acting just like the other agents,\u201d he said, disappointed.</p><p>That seemed to please her. \u201cWhere do you hide during the day?\u201d</p><p>Hide, she\u2019d said. As if he were a coward. Rather than tell her where she could stuff the direction of her chat, he found himself growling, \u201cI rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you need to tell yourself to feel better,\u201d Noelle replied, striding forward and plopping to her ass a few feet away from him. She was still here?</p> <p>He needed to keep better track of her.</p><p>Ava claimed the spot across from the girl so that he had one on each side. Their ease didn\u2019t fool him, and he remained on guard. Though he needed something to do with his hands. They were empty, and now that he\u2019d thought about that wrestling, they ached to be filled with Ava.</p><p>Stupid hands. They kept this up, and he would cut them off. They\u2019d regrow in a few months, and hopefully have learned to behave. \u201cWhy do you wish to speak with me, anyway? Aren\u2019t you afraid I\u2019ll hurt you? Again.\u201d</p><p>Noelle stretched her long leg toward him and rubbed her booted foot against his. \u201cAre you kidding? One, we aren\u2019t afraid of anything, and two, you hurt several other AIR agents. That\u2019s why we need to speak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hurt no more than five.\u201d He frowned and pulled away from the contact. She was a beautiful woman, but she wasn\u2019t Ava, and for some reason, he didn\u2019t welcome her touch. Was even uncomfortable with it. Because Ava was watching? Seemingly unaffected by Noelle\u2019s attempt to seduce him?</p><p>He wanted her jealous?</p><p>Not missing a beat, Ava blinked over at him. \u201cAnd because you hurt no more than five, that makes your actions justifiable? You removed their fingers without cause, McKell.\u201d</p><p>He liked his name on those lush, red lips. \u201cThey were chasing me and touched my things. What better cause is there?\u201d</p> <p>The two women shared a look before Noelle shrugged. \u201cYou have to admit, Av, he makes an excellent point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you\u2019re on his side,\u201d Ava said, exasperated. She lifted a twig from the ground and tossed it into the crackling fire. \u201cYou still have dibs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re annoying. Here I am, handing you a slice of beefcake on a silver platter, and you\u2019re arguing with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you before,\u201d Ava growled, \u201cbut I\u2019ll tell you again. I don\u2019t want him.\u201d</p><p>Noelle nodded, as if her point had just been made. \u201cLike I said. Annoying.\u201d</p><p>Yes, she was, McKell silently agreed, claws digging into the rock.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, you\u2019re a pesky little fly,\u201d Ava said conversationally. \u201cAnd if you aren\u2019t careful, I\u2019m going to swat you away. With my knife.\u201d</p><p>Noelle opened her mouth to reply, but McKell held up one hand. \u201cNot another word from you, pesky little fly.\u201d He didn\u2019t like the way she argued with Ava, treating her as something beneath her.</p><p>A deadly stillness fell over Ava. \u201cWhat did you call her?\u201d</p><p>His brow furrowed. \u201cA pesky little fly. Just as you called her.\u201d Had he pronounced one of the words wrong? But that couldn\u2019t be the case. He knew the human language as well as his own.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you call her?\u201d she asked again, whispering this time. A dark whisper, rage in the undertone.</p><p>\u201cA ... pesky little fly?\u201d Seriously, what had he done wrong?</p><p>\u201cOh, are you gonna get it,\u201d Noelle sang happily.</p><p>Before he could blink, Ava was on him, a catapult of pummeling fists, kicking legs, and snapping teeth. He was so stunned, he could only sit there, enduring the abuse. By the time his protective instincts switched on, it was too late.</p><p>She\u2019d already withdrawn a blade. Had already sunk that blade into his side. Then she pulled away from him, standing, panting, glaring down at him, his blood dripping from the blade. Noelle had stood, as well, he noticed, and had watched the entire \u201cfight\u201d with a grin.</p><p>\u201cYou stabbed me,\u201d he said, his shock as dark as her rage had been. Scowling, he clutched his stinging side. \u201cYou really stabbed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow kind of you to notice, you bastard!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could I not notice? That hurt!\u201d he snarled, though he didn\u2019t freeze her. Or retaliate. Still too shocked, he thought. Not disappointed. Not confused. Not upset that she hadn\u2019t spared him pain as he had done for her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever call my friend a name like that again.\u201d Fury sparkled in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cBut she isn\u2019t your friend.\u201d He pressed against the wound, grimaced. He would heal, but as deep as she\u2019d twisted that tip, and twist and twist she had, he would suffer for hours. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my best friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t you forget it,\u201d Noelle added with a nod.</p><p>So Ava could call the girl names, but no one else could do so? That made no sense.</p><p>He pushed to his feet. The girls didn\u2019t back down or even step out of striking distance. Should have been a mistake. A fatal mistake. He should have attacked. But he stood there, breathing in and out, his nostrils flaring with the force he used. \u201cIf I were you, I would leave this camp. Now.\u201d Before he lost his grip on whatever emotion was keeping him in place.</p><p>\u201cFine. You ruined everything, anyway.\u201d Ava raised her nose in the air, as if she had every reason to be angry with him, grabbed her friend by the forearm, and tugged her into the woods, moving farther and farther away from him.</p><p>Five</p><p>After Ava turned in the bloody blade for testing, and endured an eternity of Mia looking at the weapon, then Ava, then the weapon, then Ava again, silent all the while, shock thickening the air, pride and regret battling inside her, she had Noelle drop her off at her apartment for a little \u201cdecompression\u201d time.</p><p>The one-bedroom efficiency was small but clean, plain but calming. Her furnishings were threadbare but lovingly patched up. For too many years, she\u2019d lived in filth, her mother too wasted to care about the state of their trailer, God bless her, the strangers parading in and out, or her only daughter\u2019s wellbeing. Then Ava had met Noelle and started crashing at her place; the luxury had amazed her.</p><p>But then she\u2019d begun to feel guilty, as if she were taking advantage of her best friend. Hadn\u2019t helped when people started saying she was only using Noelle for her money. And it really hadn\u2019t helped when Noelle started beating the shit out of everyone who said it, getting herself expelled and causing friction with her family. So right after high school, Ava had moved out of there, too, and gotten this apartment. That\u2019s when she discovered a pride she hadn\u2019t known she could feel. Pride that she had earned this on her own. Pride that she could take care of herself.</p><p>The apartment wasn\u2019t luxurious by any means, but it hers.</p><p>Yawning, she stripped and showered in her dry enzyme stall. A standard issue, with no extras, but she was lucky to have it. A lot of people had to use public stalls. A walk-in, feed-a-few-dollars-into-the-slot, wash-with-your-clothes-on, walk-out operation. What she\u2019d had to use most of her childhood, with money she\u2019d stolen from the people standing in line with her. Nothing wrong with that method, minus the thief, of course, but she preferred to use heated spray rather than room temp, linger for as long as she liked, and not talk to strangers.</p><p>The warm mist seeped into her skin, cleaning her inside and out. After watching McKell\u2019s blood slowly fade from her hands, and battling a fierce urge to cry about its loss, blaming fatigue all the while, she closed her eyes and let her mind drift\u2014away from McKell, back to McKell, away again, then curse that bastard, back again. Damn vampire! He shouldn\u2019t have badmouthed Noelle. Only Ava had that right. Everyone else suffered, as McKell could now attest.</p><p>When others even looked at Noelle the wrong way, rage consumed Ava. Rage she couldn\u2019t control. Always. Maybe because a threat to her friend was a threat to her happiness. Maybe because, even though Noelle was rich, she\u2019d had as emotionally whacked out a childhood as Ava had had. Her parents had been cold, distant, and unconcerned about their daughter until she embarrassed them. Which she had. A lot. And maybe, in the beginning, that was why Noelle had wanted to hang out with Ava. But the more time they\u2019d spent together, the more they\u2019d realized how much they actually needed each other. They loved and they accepted without judgment or conditions.</p><p>They also relied on each other for bail.</p><p>McKell had probably thought, as so many others before him, that she and Noelle were adversaries. Which was an easy mistake to make, she supposed. They argued and called each other names, but underneath each of their clashes was affection and purpose.</p><p>Hopefully, the mistake wasn\u2019t debilitating on McKell\u2019s part.</p><p>Debilitating. She gulped as guilt filled her. Though what she had to feel guilty about, she didn\u2019t know. Really. If McKell had kept his stupid mouth closed, she would have gotten a blood sample another, nicer way. But nooo. Now he might be incapacitated by blood loss or infection. Or die.</p><p>Die. She gulped again as dread filled her\u2014then anger that she even cared. He was nothing, damn it. An assignment.</p><p>Scowling, she left the stall, dressed in a tank top and panties and fell onto her bed. Don\u2019t think about him. Relax, rest. She had a big day tomorrow. Namely, she planned to bask in the accolades of her fellow trainees because she had gotten that blood sample. Finally she\u2019d have the respect she deserved. Then, of course, she would research ways to prevent time manipulation.</p><p>Would Mia want her to try to capture McKell again?</p><p>You\u2019re thinking about him again.</p><p>Argh! For hours, Ava tossed and turned, her mind constantly returning to the forest. McKell on his rock. McKell gaping in astonishment. McKell bleeding. A crimson river, shirt soaked to his side. Pain a glaze of frost in those violet eyes.</p><p>Stupid McKell. He only had himself to blame.</p><p>Realizing the futility of trying to sleep, she got up and brewed a pot of coffee. The sun was out and brighter than shit, anyway, which wasn\u2019t really conducive to a good, or even halfway decent, rest.</p><p>Nothing was, to be honest. Not for her. She\u2019d suffered from insomnia forever, and figured she would suffer with it the rest of forever, as well. As a child, she\u2019d known that one of her mother\u2019s \u201cfriends\u201d could walk into her bedroom at any time and hurt her, so she\u2019d taught herself to rouse at the slightest noise. Sadly, the skill had come in handy.</p><p>Soon, though, she\u2019d stopped sleeping altogether. And even while living in the Tremain compound, as she called it, with the best security money could buy, Noelle in the bed next to her, she hadn\u2019t rested properly.</p><p>Some habits were too hard to break, she supposed. Which was a very good reason to finally stop thinking about her vampire. She didn\u2019t want McKell-pondering to become a habit. Or an obsession. But ...</p><p>Was he okay?</p><p>She sank into the cold metal chair in front of her kitchen counter. This time, she didn\u2019t try to clear her mind. Contemplating a man\u2019s ultimate fate wasn\u2019t obsessive; it was considerate. What if she\u2019d killed him?</p><p>Oh, God. McKell ... dead ... The possibility seemed more likely with every second that passed and he didn\u2019t show up to retaliate.</p><p>Bile burned her throat as she dropped her head in her upraised hands, elbows propped against the stone counter. Why do you care? And she did. She cared. Because he wouldn\u2019t be able to answer Mia\u2019s questions, and wouldn\u2019t be able to donate more of his blood to the Save a Human from the Sch\u00f6n Queen foundation. Surely. But she couldn\u2019t deny that those very logical, acceptable reasons meant nothing to her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>McKell could have maimed or killed her, but had written on her instead. McKell could have chosen elegant Noelle, but had chosen tiny Ava instead. He could have left her naked and defenseless, but he\u2019d let her keep her underwear, and part of her still suspected he had followed her home, despite what common sense told her. Just to ensure she arrived safely. And last night, he could have attacked her, but hadn\u2019t.</p><p>What had she done?</p><p>Breathe, you have to breathe.</p> <p>Even lost to her rage as she\u2019d been, she had managed to avoid all his major organs. Good, breathing. Calming. He would be fine. If the inside of his vampire body was humanoid. Oh, God. Bye-bye, calm. What if it wasn\u2019t? What if she\u2019d damaged him irreparably?</p><p>Perhaps she\u2019d overreacted to his slur just a wee bit, she thought now.</p><p>Maybe she\u2019d check on him tonight. Mia would want a status report. Right? Would McKell still be in that forest, though? Would he attack Ava this time? He would have every right to do so. She\u2019d have to find a way to protect herself without hurting him further.</p><p>Damn him, why hadn\u2019t he frozen her after she\u2019d stabbed him? He could have. Right? Except, maybe when injured, his ability to manipulate time\u2014and people\u2014failed him. If so, that meant ... oh ... shit. If so, he was in major danger. He wouldn\u2019t be able to protect himself. Especially if Mia sent other AIR agents after him. Real agents, this time.</p><p>Knowing Mia, that was a strong possibility.</p> <p>The new agents might not be as gentle as Ava had been, and the thought of someone else hurting McKell ... angered her, she realized as her nails cut into her palms with the same precision they had when she\u2019d thought of him with another woman. Not to the red-haze degree that Noelle-bashing did, but still. Definite anger.</p><p>How odd. She\u2019d never cared about anyone else\u2019s well-being. On the streets it was survival first, everything else second. Although, when she thought about it, McKell was her target, so she had a right to be proprietary toward him.</p><p>Okay, so. Game plan. She\u2019d visit him tonight. If he was still in the forest, she would subdue him as needed, then protect him from any and all threats. Human, animal, it didn\u2019t matter. And when he healed, she would take him into AIR as ordered. That way, she could feel proud of a job well done. Not embarrassed by a job done just because the guy was weakened. At least, that\u2019s the rational she used.</p><p>Except, when he healed, she would face the same problem as last night. No one could make McKell do anything he didn\u2019t want to do. Damn him, she thought again. His ability to manipulate time put a serious damper on her ability to force him to do what she wanted.</p><p>A heavy, insistent knock sounded at her door.</p><p>Ava pushed to still shaky legs and threw her mug in the sink. Noelle was coded into the ID pad, and loved to enter at the most awkward times, so Ava knew her friend wasn\u2019t the intruder. Mia, maybe? With new orders? Not McKell. He would have kicked the door in.</p> <p>As another knock sounded, she trudged to her bedroom and tugged on a loose pair of shorts. She didn\u2019t like the way her hands shook. By the time a third knock rang out, this one harder, more insistent, she stood at the entrance, gaping. And still shaking.</p><p>She\u2019d been wrong. McKell\u2019s (not so beautiful anymore) face consumed her ID screen. He was here. He was alive. And acting civilized.</p><p>He stood in her building\u2019s hallway, fist lifting to once again bang at her door. His other hand was curled into a fist, too\u2014with a long, black whip dangling from both sides. \u201cI know you\u2019re there, Ava. I can smell you. Open. Now.\u201d</p><p>Heart slamming against her ribs, she did just that. She opened the door. He towered over her, scowling, fangs bared, clutching his bleeding side. Worse, his skin was red and blistered, and those blisters were oozing. Obviously he\u2019d battled the sun to get here. Which meant he had a specific purpose for seeking her out. Killing her? With that whip?</p><p>Probably. He smiled slowly, but that smile promised she would like the way he ended her.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t scared, though. She could take care of herself. What she was, was shocked. Big, strong, okay, fine, still gorgeous even with those blisters, McKell was actually, finally here. Intense relief swept through her, followed on the heels of heat ... need ... Don\u2019t go there.</p><p>\u201cDid you come for revenge?\u201d she asked, gaze immediately lowering to the whip. At the moment, they were the only words her reeling brain could form.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not healing,\u201d he said. The smile vanished, and he shook the whip at her. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t I healing, woman?\u201d He didn\u2019t wait for her reply, but stormed inside her apartment.</p> <p>His body brushed hers, and despite the clothing between them, despite the situation and the consequences, despite the increase of heat, she shivered. \u201cCome in,\u201d she said dryly. He. Was. Here. She couldn\u2019t get over that fact.</p><p>He tossed a feral growl over his shoulder, gait never slowing. \u201cI asked you a question.\u201d</p><p>She shut and locked the door, then followed the path he had taken. In her living room, she watched as he fell onto the couch. He studied his surroundings with a single sweep\u2014and she would bet he\u2019d memorized every exit, every conceivable weapon\u2014before glaring over at her. What did he think of her home? Did he see how hard she\u2019d worked for every piece of furniture, or did he merely view her as poor?</p><p>There was a flicker of admiration in that gaze, she realized. He knew how hard she\u2019d worked. Now her heart skipped a beat. He shouldn\u2019t have been more beautiful just because he was surrounded by her stuff in her place, admiring, but he was. His black hair hung in disarray, his violet eyes gleamed brightly. His skin, already healing. His lips were parted, kissable.</p><p>Don\u2019t think like that. Swallowing the lump forming in her throat, she rested her hands on her hips. \u201cYou asked me a question, yes, and I ignored it. Twice. Take a hint and stop asking. So how\u2019d you know where I lived, anyway?\u201d Was that breathless tone hers?</p><p>\u201cI have your ID,\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>Oh. Duh.</p><p>\u201cAnd I followed you the other night.\u201d</p><p>A shattering confirmation of her suspicions. She was delighted to her very soul.</p><p>Now she experienced fear. Fear that she was allowing attraction to overwhelm her. Time to paint him in a negative light, and put a stop to the craziness.</p><p>\u201cAre you here for revenge?\u201d she asked again, squaring her shoulders.</p><p>He ran his tongue over his teeth. Those sharp, deadly teeth. \u201cThat will come. Later.\u201d</p><p>The thought of this man, this killer, having revenge excited her, she realized, and the fear grew until she had to rub her chest to ward off the ache. She could suddenly imagine tongue-lashings and well-placed nibbling, moaning, groaning, begging. All because of that butterscotch voice.</p><p>Oh, yes. Fear. Her attraction was overwhelming, not dulled in the least. Fight it.</p><p>\u201cWhat comes now?\u201d she asked. \u201cThe whip?\u201d His answer would determine how they proceeded. Sugar and spice, or absolutely nothing nice.</p><p>He looked at the coiled length of leather as if he had no idea it was in his hand. \u201cOh. This. It\u2019s my preferred method for restraining females.\u201d He tossed the whip aside, the action making him grimace. \u201cAs you are unexpectedly cooperating ...\u201d He let the thought trail off. \u201cI want to know why I\u2019m not healing.\u201d</p><p>How many females had he restrained over the years?</p><p>Another don\u2019t go there filled her head. She studied him anew, her gaze dropping to his seeping wound, and the guilt she\u2019d experienced earlier roared back to life, draining the fear, defeating her before the battle could even begin. He wore a new shirt\u2014the tag still hung from the neck\u2014but on his left side, the material was soaked with blood. He was as injured as when she\u2019d left him.</p><p>After a second more of consideration, she knew that wasn\u2019t true. He\u2019d worsened.</p><p>Her own side twitched in sympathy. \u201cDo you normally heal fast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. The bleeding should have stopped hours ago. Was your blade tipped with poison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She wasn\u2019t a total bitch.</p><p>Another growl erupted from him. \u201cWhat did you do to me, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? Nothing!\u201d Guilt ... escalating ... If she had to choose between feeling guilty and having her hand chopped off, she\u2019d remove the hand, no question. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember? You walked into my knife.\u201d Though she\u2019d hoped otherwise, the denial didn\u2019t ease the guilt.</p><p>\u201cI. Was. Sitting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSemantics.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, unflinching. \u201cI\u2019d argue your use of the term, but at the moment I\u2019m a little too busy bleeding to death. Fix me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re irritable. But fine. I\u2019ll fix you.\u201d Maybe then the guilt would truly fade. \u201cQuick question. By fix you\u201d\u2014she air-quoted fix\u2014\u201cdo you mean sew you up like I would a human?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there any other way?\u201d he snapped.</p><p>Irr-it-able. \u201cYou\u2019d trust me with a needle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But I\u2019ll have my teeth ready to rip into you if you try to stab me with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cComforting. With that kind of threat hanging over my head, I\u2019ll probably be shaking too badly to do you any good.\u201d She was shaking, yes, but fear still wasn\u2019t the reason. The shock of his presence, the guilt of her actions, of course, were both still a cause, but so was an increase in desire. He was a warrior to his soul.</p><p>Violet eyes sizzled. \u201cFix. Me. And if you cause any more damage, human, note that I\u2019ll hurt you in kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo noted.\u201d With another sigh, she padded into the bathroom and grabbed her first aid kit. By the time she returned, McKell had removed his shirt. The bloody material rested on her coffee table.</p><p>Frowning at him, she kicked the offending shirt to the floor. \u201cIf the table is stained, you\u2019re buying me a new one.\u201d</p><p>He merely raised his chin and motioned for her to get started.</p><p>She closed the rest of the distance and knelt between his open legs\u2014and tried not to peek at his man business, covered so demurely by his pants. If she did, she\u2019d be tempted to study every ridge and discover if she affected him the same way he affected her.</p><p>She needed a distraction.</p><p>\u201cSo. Have you fed today?\u201d she asked, resting the kit on his thigh.</p><p>\u201cMany times.\u201d There was anger in his tone. Anger she didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m not in danger of blood loss myself?\u201d Alcohol, cloth.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>Needle, thread. Her lips curled as she fought to hide her amusement. She considered the wound. Raw, angry skin. Torn, jagged muscle, like puzzle pieces in need of connecting. Ouch. She cleaned him as gently as she could before withdrawing a half-filled syringe.</p><p>\u201cNo medication,\u201d he snapped, gripping her wrist and holding her hand in place.</p><p>She looked up, and her gaze connected with his, crackling. \u201cBut this will numb you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr kill me.\u201d</p><p>And the problem? \u201cEither way, you won\u2019t feel the stitches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo medication,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cYour pain, your choice.\u201d</p><p>He released her, and she jumped back into her work. She expected him to scream with the first pierce of the needle, but no. Not her McKell. He gritted his teeth and silently endured.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get those scars on your hands?\u201d He\u2019d probably meant to ease back into conversation, but his pain gave him a dangerous vibe.</p><p>\u201cFights, mostly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith who?\u201d If he\u2019d sounded dangerous before, he was positively lethal now.</p><p>\u201cLots of people. In school, I kind of had a temper. I would attack at the slightest provocation. Even when I knew I was going to get my ass kicked.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, surprising her. \u201cIn school. You kind of had a temper. And now you\u2019re, what? Calm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely. Calling me an angel wouldn\u2019t even be a stretch.\u201d She finished the last stitch\u2014he\u2019d needed thirty-nine\u2014and said, \u201cAll done,\u201d then gently bandaged him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d Now there was a pout in his voice. \u201cYou owe me blood.\u201d</p><p>Ava could feel his gaze on her neck, burning where her pulse hammered wildly. She ... liked it. Liked the thought of him leaning down, biting, sucking ... tasting.</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d already eaten.\u201d Good. Rather than reveal just how ravenous she suddenly was for what he offered, there\u2019d been an air of impassivity to her.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that have to do with anything? You\u2019re to be my dessert.\u201d A put-down, from his point of view, obviously, since his tone was sneering.</p><p>Maybe she could have allowed it, even then. But was he attracted to her? Or did he just like the smell of her blood? Either could explain why he\u2019d picked her over Noelle, despite the fact that Noelle had wanted him. \u201cHad\u201d being the key word. After he\u2019d called dibs on Ava, Noelle had washed her hands of him, no matter what the girl claimed.</p><p>Ava wanted his attraction to equal\u2014or be greater than\u2014hers. Nothing else would satisfy her. If she was going to allow him to have her, that is. Which she wasn\u2019t. \u201cThe fact that I stabbed you wasn\u2019t a deal breaker?\u201d she asked, hoping to anger him, distract him.</p><p>He growled again.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Too soon to joke about it?\u201d She leaned back on her haunches. She should have stood, walked away, but couldn\u2019t find the will to do so.</p><p>He didn\u2019t move, either. \u201cWhy did you stab me? I still don\u2019t understand what I did to enrage you. And you were enraged. The emotion poured off you.\u201d</p><p>How to explain? \u201cDo you have a brother or a sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA best friend you love but who irritates the hell out of you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother? Father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. They died decades ago.\u201d</p> <p>Decades. Wow. So he\u2019d been on his own his entire, clearly too-long life? How ... sad. Everyone needed a friend. Even emotionally distanced vampires. \u201cWell, imagine what it\u2019d be like if you did have someone in your life. Just one person you cared about. Noelle is that one person to me. She\u2019s my only friend and family, and I love her more than anything or anyone else in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet you call her names. Hell, she calls you names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne, we\u2019re comfortable with each other. Two, we\u2019re confident enough in our affections to be honest with each other. And three, sometimes people need to be razed to find their inner strength.\u201d Ava flattened her hands on his thighs, knocking the kit out of the way. To balance herself while crouching. That was all. Really. God, he was strong. And hot. All those muscles ... Concentrate. \u201cBut anyone else who says an unkind word is punished for doing so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t understand. Where I\u2019m from, you treat your loved ones with deference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven when they\u2019re bugging you?\u201d</p> <p>Silent now, he popped his jaw.</p><p>She\u2019d take that for a yes. That had to be hell, to never be allowed to express your anger at the person you loved. Pent-up resentment, thy name is McKell. No wonder he hadn\u2019t attacked Ava after she\u2019d stabbed him. Not that he loved her, but he did want something from her. Clearly.</p><p>She was not disappointed. \u201cWhy are you here, McKell?\u201d</p><p>His fingers wrapped around her wrists, once again holding her hands in place. \u201cWe will discuss that. After.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter.\u201d How sensually he\u2019d said the word ... She licked her lips, hating the way her heart sped into an unending hyper-beat. \u201cAfter the biting?\u201d</p><p>He arched a brow. \u201cYou would let me bite you?\u201d</p> <p>Yes. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, no.\u201d Grated, halting. \u201cAfter the bargaining.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d Would that bargain involve nakedness? Moaning? She wouldn\u2019t say yes, of course, but it was flattering that he\u2014</p><p>\u201cAIR wishes to speak with me, yes?\u201d</p><p>Wasn\u2019t after her body. Disappointment rocked her, undeniable this time. \u201cYeah. So?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo. I will finally talk with them.\u201d</p><p>She ignored the wave of concern suddenly crashing through her. AIR wouldn\u2019t go easy on him just because he turned himself in. \u201cAnd all I have to do in return is...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp me track other vampires living on the surface.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHelp you track other vampires? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause.\u201d His mouth was a stubborn, mulish line.</p><p>There was only one way to get what you wanted from a man like McKell. Taunt him. \u201cI seriously misjudged your talents. I thought you\u2019d be an excellent hunter and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can track them no problem,\u201d he snapped. \u201cBut that used to be one of my jobs. I would come here and track them, and then execute them for leaving our underground world.\u201d</p><p>Score one for Ava. An answer, freely given. But ... wait. Would another vampire be coming for McKell to execute him? She opened her mouth to ask, but he said, \u201cNow they run from me or fight me, even though I only wish to question them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you\u2019ve been doing today? Fighting vampires?\u201d</p><p>A stiff nod. \u201cAmong other things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no wonder your wound wasn\u2019t healing. Moron! Injuries require rest.\u201d</p><p>His grip tightened on her wrists, almost bruising, yet managing to skate the edge of pain. \u201cYes, but someone made me a target for every vampire in the area. They scented me out, knew I was weakened and they\u2019d never have a better chance to defeat me, and attacked.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach clenched at the thought of this man being hurt, and she scowled. She was the moron. Concern for the enemy? Again? \u201cDid you kill them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccidentally,\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>Good. To attack a helpless man\u2014she almost laughed. As if McKell would be helpless, even buried ten feet underground with his hands and feet tied. Still. Those vampires had deserved what they got. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize so many bloodsuckers lived up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve learned to hide their race.\u201d</p><p>And now he wanted to do so? Was that why he wanted to talk to them? To learn how they did it? \u201cSo you want me to question them for you, is that it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Just ... distract them for me.\u201d</p><p>Not a bad deal. Afterward, she\u2019d bring in McKell, as ordered, and look like a hero. She would also learn the names and locations of the other vampires, just in case Mia wanted to test their blood, as well. That wouldn\u2019t be a betrayal to McKell. Okay, it would, but she barely knew him, and he was the enemy. The sexiest, most erotic enemy of her acquaintance, but whatever. Her loyalty was to AIR.</p><p>\u201cI agree. I\u2019ll help you find and distract other vampires, and in return you\u2019ll talk with Mia Snow. So do we need to seal this deal with a kiss or what?\u201d she asked flippantly. Or meant to ask flippantly. The heated catch of her breath gave her away. Longing ... so much longing ... since the very first.</p><p>For several seconds, he simply stared at her, gaze eating her up, leaving her panting, shaky. She tried to pull away, to end the madness. To destroy the minefield of awareness.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he finally said, and hauled her onto his lap.</p><p>Six</p><p>Holy hell, McKell thought.</p><p>As Ava gasped in shock, hands slapping against his chest to find balance, knees straddling his thighs, he thrust his tongue deep into her mouth. Warm, wet, sweet. That\u2019s what she was, and she utterly slayed him, not fighting him but embracing him, giving as much as he did.</p><p>She\u2019d wanted it; he\u2019d known she had. Had smelled her arousal, as sweet as the woman herself. But there\u2019d still been a question in his mind. She wanted, but would she acquiesce? She was a warrior, after all, and as fierce as he was. Maybe even more so. Not once since he\u2019d entered her home had she truly feared him.</p><p>Now, though, he knew beyond any doubt. She\u2019d acquiesced. Amazingly so.</p><p>He moaned in pleasure, and tragically the sound jolted his common sense. Shouldn\u2019t be this good. Nothing should be this good.</p><p>Still. He didn\u2019t stop. Couldn\u2019t. Even though he was shaky and needed to remain on guard. Especially with this unpredictable woman. He let their tongues continue to play, to duel, to roll and thrust, sipping, feeding, driving them closer and closer to a ledge they might later wish they\u2019d never built. For it was a ledge of their own making, one that promised a torturous fall, a fatal landing. He could have stayed away. She could have refused him. Neither of them had.</p><p>He could have left after she\u2019d practically dared him to sample these tantalizing lips.</p><p>They were fools. He\u2019d come here to drink her dry. He\u2019d come here to yell at her, shake her, choke her, something. And he\u2019d been primed for a fight. He\u2019d had to avoid two doorways on the way here. Usually he merely encountered one a day. That was all. But they seemed to be following him now, more determined than ever to suck him inside.</p><p>One look at her, though, those amber eyes ablaze, and he\u2019d forgotten the urge to fight and decided to bargain with her and she had agreed. Oh, yes. They were fools.</p><p>This kiss would have to suffice as \u201csomething.\u201d</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t regret his choice. Not while her nails sank into his shoulders, not to push him away but to urge him closer. Not while her core rubbed against his shaft, insistent, determined. Not while he plumped the sweet mounds of her breasts, her nipples rasping against his palms. Sweet heaven.</p><p>He\u2019d thought he would have to force his way inside, but again, she had surprised him. Had allowed him to walk right in, teasing him all the while. She\u2019d even doctored him, those delicate-looking hands gentle on his wound.</p><p>Why wasn\u2019t she trying to hurt him further?</p><p>He knew why he was acting as he was. He was weakened from blood loss. He\u2019d tried to feed before coming here. Many times, as he\u2019d told her, but his stomach had rebelled and he\u2019d vomited nearly every drop. He didn\u2019t know why\u2014that had never happened to him before\u2014but he knew where to lay the blame.</p><p>Punish her as originally planned.</p><p>\u201cMcKell,\u201d she said on a moan.</p><p>Forget punishing her. He must have suspected he would go this route. Why else would he have washed his mouth so many times?</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t really like to be treated like a lady, right? Please tell me you don\u2019t.\u201d She\u2019d told Noelle she was a fragile flower.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. Treat me bad. Real bad.\u201d</p><p>Thank God. He released her breasts and sank his fingers into her scalp, forcing her head to tilt and allowing him deeper contact. As the kiss spun even closer to that dangerous ledge, intensifying, he slid his hands down her back, along the ridges of her spine, and stopped on her ass, dragging her closer ... closer still ...</p><p>\u201cAva,\u201d he said on a moan. He tightened his grip on her, probably leaving bruises.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not convinced you\u2019re serious about our bargain,\u201d she rasped. \u201cConvince me some more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore. Yes.\u201d</p><p>The tips of his fangs sharpened, ready, eager. He couldn\u2019t help himself; he scraped them against her tongue. She jerked, unprepared, groaned, but didn\u2019t pull away. She edged the rest of the way, connecting fully, only clothing keeping him from penetration. He sucked. A bead of her blood trickled into his mouth, down his throat, dancing in his stomach, and he jerked. The decadent flavor ... like the sugar sweetness of her lipgloss ...</p><p>Good no longer described this kiss. Exquisite, maybe. Perfection, definitely. Addicting, probably.</p><p>Addicted? Yes. He was. And he wasn\u2019t sorry.</p><p>He needed more, as he\u2019d told her. Had to have more. He sucked, and another bead formed. Once again the drugging sweetness astonished him. He savored before swallowing, the warmth instantly traveling through him, strengthening him, easing the sting in his wound. Finally, it began to heal.</p><p>More.</p><p>Her hands fisted his hair, ripping several strands free, but not to stop him\u2014to urge him on. He knew because her tongue continued that devastating roll, more insistent now, purrs humming from her throat. Her hips moved in sync with her tongue, mimicking sex, rubbing against him, control fading. He needed to open her pants and delve into her panties. He needed to feel how wet she was. Needed to sink one, two, three fingers into that tight little sheath.</p><p>\u201cMcKell,\u201d she gasped out.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d was all he could think to say. But any more, and he would pull from the kiss, sink his fangs into her neck, and drain her. He knew he would. Already an intense hunger beat through him, growing, propelling him to act as instinct demanded. As survival demanded.</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d Unaware of the animal she provoked, she rubbed him faster and faster, reducing him to that creature of sensation. Only sensation.</p><p>Instinct ... food ...</p><p>No. If he drained her, he wouldn\u2019t be able to kiss her again. And he desperately needed her kisses. Her touch. His cock ached unbearably, rising past the waist of his pants, seeking every bit of contact, any contact. Damn their clothing. He wanted to penetrate. Needed to penetrate with the same intensity he needed the kiss, the blood. And he wanted to\u2014the core of her rubbed against him again, from base to tip, and his thoughts fragmented. He found himself lifting, grinding against her, shoving her harder, their clothing no longer a concern. Just a little more and he would ... come, he realized with shock. He would come in his pants like an untrained youth.</p><p>And when he came, he really would drain her, instinct taking over completely. In his weakened condition, he wouldn\u2019t be able to stop himself.</p><p>McKell gripped her hips, stilling her this time. He was panting, sweating, shaking. Frantic ... starving ... Oh, yes, starving.</p><p>Control. He had to gain control.</p><p>Didn\u2019t help when Ava licked the moisture from her mouth, savoring the taste he\u2019d left behind. \u201cWhy\u2019d you stop?\u201d she asked, and she sounded drugged. Her eyes were glassy, like liquid amber, and her lips a well-sated scarlet.</p><p>\u201cFor the best.\u201d Never had his voice echoed with such menace. For himself. He should have been eager to drain her. Resisting merely proved the true depths of his foolishness.</p><p>\u201cWhose best?\u201d she asked, nuzzling his cheek with her own.</p><p>She was going to kill him. And herself. \u201cYours,\u201d he gritted out</p><p>\u201c\u2018Cause you just snuck a taste of my blood and are trolling for more?\u201d Slowly she straightened and ran her hands up and down his arms. She grinned a wicked grin. \u201cGod, your muscles are huge.\u201d</p><p>And he\u2019d thought her kiss torture. Her caress ... like heaven and hell wrapped in silk, sprinkled with velvet, then bespelled with an irresistible mist. He grabbed her wrists as he\u2019d done earlier and squeezed. \u201cIf you don\u2019t behave yourself, I\u2019ll sneak a whole lot more than you\u2019re willing to give.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze met his, all soft and luminous. \u201cSo you liked it?\u201d Another purr as she pulled from his grip and toyed with his necklace.</p><p>Do not answer that. Don\u2019t you dare answer that.</p><p>Her grin returned. \u201cTsk, tsk, McKell. You should know it\u2019s rude to ignore your host.\u201d</p><p>Change the subject. Save yourself, her. \u201cIt\u2019s also rude to stab your host.\u201d There. Better. Except, the reminder failed to enrage him. She\u2019d gotten the better of him, which meant she was strong, capable, and that suddenly filled him with ... pride.</p><p>Pride? Why?</p><p>All that lovely amusement faded. \u201cHere\u2019s another tidbit. It\u2019s also rude to remind your host of the time she stabbed you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Irreverent baggage. And stupid, stupid increased pride. He liked her wit.</p><p>\u201cWere you distracting me so that you could stab me?\u201d she rasped, arching into him. The very idea should have sent her running from him. Yet still she remained completely unconcerned.</p><p>Either she was confident in her ability to protect herself or confident in his in ability to hurt her. Either way, his sense of pride increased again. The heart of a warrior beat in her chest.</p> <p>Stupid, stupid, stupid of him to crave her.</p><p>\u201cAva.\u201d He needed something to do with his hands, and so he once again latched onto her hips. He squeezed so tightly he knew bruises would form, if they hadn\u2019t already, but better to mark her that way than the other. \u201cStop moving on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMcKell. Answer my question. Please.\u201d</p><p>Had he liked her blood? \u201cWhat if I did?\u201d He wouldn\u2019t admit to the helpless need to possess her. The need to have her curves under him\u2014over him. The need to have her touching, tasting, giving, taking. Oh, taking. Taking more than anyone else ever had. \u201cWhat would you do if I decided to have you?\u201d He hadn\u2019t meant the words as a challenge, but that\u2019s how they emerged.</p><p>She licked her lips. \u201cStop you, of course.\u201d But she didn\u2019t sound confident.</p> <p>He chuckled. Then frowned. Beyond stupid, that\u2019s what he was. \u201cI think you\u2019ve changed your mind about me.\u201d How many times had she told Noelle she didn\u2019t want him? Countless. And usually a human\u2019s disregard wouldn\u2019t have bothered him. Humans were beneath him, after all, but he couldn\u2019t walk away from this one. As evidenced by his actions today.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she asked, settling her weight on her haunches. Away from his erection.</p><p>\u201cBefore, you weren\u2019t willing to do a load of laundry to be with me. Now, I think you would.\u201d</p><p>She arched a brow. \u201cHurt your feelings when I said that, did I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d The denial echoed from the walls, and his cheeks heated at his own vehemence. \u201cNo,\u201d he stated more calmly. \u201cI have no feelings. I was simply repeating something you said.\u201d</p><p>She grinned, and the return of her amusement lit her beautiful face. Again, most people ran from him in terror when he displayed the slightest hint of displeasure. Those who didn\u2019t soon wished they had. And really, this one had more reason than most to fear him. Yet she remained on his lap, as calm as ever.</p> <p>Nibbling on her bottom lip, she traced a fingertip down his sternum. \u201cWell, to be fair, I hadn\u2019t kissed you then, so I had no idea what I was giving up.\u201d</p><p>Another hint for him to get back to kissing her?</p><p>Slaying ... him. \u201cThe bargain has been sealed,\u201d he said. Before she could tempt her further, he did what he should have done minutes ago: unceremoniously dumped her onto the floor.</p><p>Severing the contact failed to calm him, though. His body still ached, and his teeth still throbbed for another taste.</p><p>She gasped in surprise and glared up at him, her silky curls in disarray around her shoulders. \u201cAnd by had no idea what I was giving up, I meant kissing you would be awful and wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind. And I was right!\u201d</p><p>Liar. Her pupils were blown, her lips still red and swollen, and with the distance between them, he was finally able to concentrate on more than the heaven that rested between her legs. He could hear the rush of blood through her veins, swift and needy. Could smell the desire pouring off her, sweet and heady.</p><p>That should have increased his hunger. Instead, his instincts switched gears. From wanting to devour to wanting to protect, and this time, they far overshadowed his need for blood. Odd. Incomprehensible.</p><p>She popped to her feet and dusted off her hands, all while donning a mask of disinterest. \u201cAnyway, the bargain can\u2019t be sealed. We haven\u2019t set the rules yet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe rules are simple,\u201d he said, relaxing in his seat and adopting the same disinterested mask. He liked this couch. Its softness, its worn exterior. Every crease meant Ava\u2019s body had rubbed there. Repeatedly. \u201cYou\u2019ll obey me in all things.\u201d Hadn\u2019t he made that clear already?</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d She anchored her hands on the flare of her waist. \u201cWho helps who first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll help me, since AIR will want to lock me up.\u201d Sure, he would escape the second their questions were answered and he\u2019d fulfilled his promise to Ava, but she didn\u2019t need to know that.</p><p>\u201cGood point. But in return for allowing the male to go before the female\u2014as is proper\u2014you have to swear not to drink from me without permission. Which I won\u2019t give. So that means you\u2019ll have to drink from other people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear.\u201d Because he could gain her permission with little effort. \u201cI\u2019ll drink from others.\u201d</p><p>Her lips pressed into a thin line, as if his answer had angered her. Surely he was mistaken. He\u2019d pretended to give her what she wanted. Hadn\u2019t he? What fault could she find with him?</p><p>\u201cSo my blood isn\u2019t good enough for you?\u201d she snarled. \u201cIs that it?\u201d</p><p>Oh, yes. She was angry. \u201cI never said anything about your blood not being\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust forget it,\u201d she said, derailing his rant before it could truly begin. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. And now that that\u2019s settled, when do you want to start hunting vampires?\u201d</p><p>Settled? Ha! She was still angry, yet didn\u2019t want to hear his rebuttal. He might never understand this human. \u201cWe\u2019ll start tonight.\u201d He unfolded his big body from the couch, his stitches pulling. Thankfully, the nearly debilitating sting never returned.</p><p>And wasn\u2019t that surprising? Just how powerful was Ava\u2019s blood? He\u2019d had only a few drops, yet he was healing as if he\u2019d feasted. The blisters on his skin had even faded, just from the scent of her, and though he was tired, he could function.</p><p>His head tilted to the side, his attention on her deepening, as a thought occurred to him. \u201cWhy did AIR send you to capture me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t they?\u201d she said, the words lashing as sharply as his whip. \u201cI\u2019m the best.\u201d</p><p>Aw. He\u2019d pricked her pride. \u201cYou are indeed good, but you\u2019re also in training.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d She splayed her arms, a look-at-me gesture. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, actually, it does. Or they would have made you an agent already.\u201d</p><p>She scowled at him.</p><p>Had they sent her because they\u2019d somehow known how potent her blood was? Had they known he\u2019d crave it? Had they hoped he would become her slave? He wouldn\u2019t put such an action past them. They were devious like that.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t worry about her purpose, though. Not now. There were more important matters to attend to. \u201cWhere\u2019s your bed?\u201d</p><p>She blinked over at him, confusion replacing the anger. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour bed. Where is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He pushed past her and snaked a corner. Kitchen. Small, but clean. Stone counters, stainless steel sink, metal chairs. Her dishes were put away, and there was a faint scent of butterscotch in the air. His mouth watered, and he fisted his hands. Stupid scent. He almost wished he\u2019d never encountered it before, because now the slightest whiff caused his cock to stand at instant attention.</p><p>\u201cMcKell,\u201d Ava called out behind him, footsteps pounding.</p><p>She followed.</p><p>He nearly grinned. \u201cAva,\u201d he called back. Another corner, and he stood at the entrance of a small bedroom. The bed was so short and thin, his feet would hang off the edge and his arms would fall off the sides. But the curtains were closed over the only window, muted shadows chasing away the brightest light, creating a homey, well-loved atmosphere, so he would make do.</p><p>He kicked off his shoes and climbed atop the mattress. The springs squeaked.</p><p>\u201cJust what the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d Ava demanded from the doorway.</p><p>He burrowed under the covers, and once again the scent of butterscotch wafted to his nose. Shaft ... twitching ... \u201cI\u2019m going to sleep.\u201d And after a few hours of rest, he would have the strength to ignore these protective instincts and bodily urges, and start acting like the ruthless vampire he was. More importantly, his mind would be alert and he could figure some things out.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to regroup. Now be quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. Sleeping? Here? With me and my weapons only a few feet away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Hopefully, resting would obliterate his foolish urge to trust her, too. But he did. Trust her. Some part of him knew she wouldn\u2019t betray him while he was at his weakest. \u201cDon\u2019t disappoint me and tattle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr you\u2019ll rip me to little pieces and send me back to Mia?\u201d Drily uttered, as if she didn\u2019t really think he\u2019d do it.</p><p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d he muttered. Her way of thinking needed a remodel, too.</p><p>\u201cBut ... but ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still talking.\u201d</p><p>There was a tense pause. Then, \u201cIf you want peace and quiet in my apartment,\u201d she snapped, \u201cyou\u2019ll have to return my phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have it with me,\u201d he lied. The phone was in his pocket, where it would remain. Perhaps forever.</p><p>\u201cReturn it later, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Another lie, but he doubted she would have liked the truth.</p><p>\u201cMcKell,\u201d she ground out, exasperated. \u201cYou can\u2019t just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill. Talking.\u201d</p><p>She cursed under her breath before slamming the door.</p><p>Was the vampire brain damaged? Ava wondered as she paced the length of her living room. Mia liked to say all men were damaged in some way, but Ava hadn\u2019t believed her. Until now.</p><p>McKell acted as if they were best friends. He acted as if he owned the place. He acted as if he hadn\u2019t kissed the breath right out of her and rocked her entire world. He acted as if her blood was subpar.</p><p>Bastard.</p><p>Sure, they were partners now. In a way. Sure, they were working together. Kind of. So he should treat her better. Definitely. He should treat her as if he valued her opinion. As if her kisses were amazing. As if her blood was the best he\u2019d ever had.</p><p>Bastard, she thought again.</p><p>When she\u2019d told him he would have to drink from other people, he\u2019d responded quickly, with no hesitation. Clearly, he\u2019d wanted to drink from other people. And that pissed her the hell off. Not just because he\u2019d made her feel subpar, which was irrational\u2014she knew it was, but she couldn\u2019t help herself\u2014but because she hated the thought of his mouth on anyone else. He should have demanded access to her blood.</p><p>Ava stomped into her kitchen and fixed herself a ham sandwich. And as she chewed with more force than necessary, she realized she was shaking. Not from anger, as she would have liked to convince herself, but from arousal.</p><p>McKell\u2019s kiss had heated her blood, and the fever had yet to cool. Her nipples were still hard, her stomach twisted into a anticipatory knot, and her skin too tight for her bones. And her tongue ached, damn it! He\u2019d scraped the sensitive flesh with his fangs, and rather than hurt her, the action had intensified her desire for him.</p><p>She\u2019d wanted her hands all over him. Had wanted to offer him complete access to her neck. Had wanted to tell him to suck every last drop of her blood. Only thoughts of who and what he was had stopped her from doing so. He was a criminal. A vampire who clearly considered himself far superior to humans.</p><p>Dessert, he\u2019d said with disdain.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t forget. Not what he thought, and not what she\u2019d always wanted. Respect. She would not be known as the agent who fucked her targets. No, no, never. Talk about humiliating. Especially since a few of the other trainees already referred to her as trash.</p><p>Street trash. Daughter-of-a-druggie trash. Trash, trash, trash. She was so used to the reference, it didn\u2019t bother her anymore. But adding to the list? Sleep-with-anything-that-breathes trash? Hell, no.</p><p>After draining a glass of water, she picked up her home phone to ring Noelle. The slide of a door caught her attention, and she dropped the phone, grinning. Noelle must have sensed her need and come running, because her friend was already here.</p><p>Ava trudged into the living room, and sure enough, Noelle had let herself in. She fell onto the couch, and stared down at the worn fabric. She frowned.</p><p>\u201cYou were bleeding?\u201d her friend said. \u201cWhich means you\u2019re injured. Why didn\u2019t you tell me you were injured? And who did it? I\u2019ll kill him. I swear to God I\u2019ll kill him dead! Is he the one who brought the whip?\u201d</p><p>Shit. McKell had left stains on the couch? He was paying the cleaning bill or buying her a new one. \u201cI\u2019m fine. The vampire was bleeding, not me.\u201d</p><p>Gray eyes swung to her, shock in their depths. \u201cHe was here? And he brought a whip?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas? No. He\u2019s still here.\u201d She jabbed her thumb toward the back of the apartment. \u201cHe\u2019s sleeping. And yes, he brought it, but no, he\u2019s not going to use it,\u201d she added before her friend could ask. She might use it, though. Later. The thought of tying him up\u2014don\u2019t you dare go there!</p><p>Now those gray eyes widened. \u201cYou banged him already?\u201d</p><p>Unlike the others, Noelle wouldn\u2019t view such a bedding as trashy. Noelle was a romantic, though she would probably deny that until her dying breath, and would have praised Ava for following her heart. Or panties.</p><p>\u201cNope. No banging.\u201d But she would have, and would have hated herself for it. Despite everything, she wouldn\u2019t have stopped him. Would have gone all the way. Taken everything he had to give. Between her legs, his cock had been thick and long and ready, and she\u2019d wanted it. Desperately. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Yet he had been of sound enough mind to stop and toss her to the floor. Now that was far more humiliating than being referred to as trash, she thought. She\u2019d craved him like a drug, yet he had remained somewhat detached.</p><p>She would not let that happen again.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s he doing here?\u201d Noelle asked, merely curious.</p> <p>\u201cHe demanded I patch him up, and then decided he needed a nap.\u201d Was her resentment showing?</p><p>\u201cSo you kissed him? \u2018Cause, baby, your lips are red and swollen.\u201d</p><p>Ava\u2019s cheeks heated. Probably to the same shade of red as her lips. \u201cYou should see my tongue.\u201d Now why had she admitted to that?</p><p>Noelle clapped excitedly. \u201cYour tongue? Did he bite it? He did, didn\u2019t he? Show me, show me! I wanna see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d</p> <p>Noelle smashed her hands together, as if she were preparing to pray. \u201cPlease. Show me. I won\u2019t laugh, I swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Once Noelle started begging, she didn\u2019t stop until she got what she wanted. Ava stuck out her tongue.</p><p>Noelle laughed. \u201cOh, my God. You have puncture wounds.\u201d</p><p>The heat in her cheeks spread to her neck, her collarbone. \u201cYou said you wouldn\u2019t laugh, Tremain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lied. You know I\u2019m a liar, so you can\u2019t hold me responsible. And he clearly likes to nibble. God, you\u2019re so lucky! And to think, I gave him to you. Just gave him away, without sampling the goods myself.\u201d She shook her head in disbelief. \u201cI\u2019m usually not such a dumbass.\u201d</p><p>Ava had never been jealous of Noelle before. Had never wanted to hide a man from her friend. Noelle had given her so much over the years, she would have happily handed over her probably-traumatized liver if her friend asked. But just then, she wanted to wash all thoughts of McKell from Noelle\u2019s mind. She wanted to place a blanket over the vampire\u2019s head and never let anyone see him ever again. Except her.</p> <p>All this jealousy, because of one kiss the vampire hadn\u2019t really cared for?</p><p>Something was seriously wrong with her. As she\u2019d already decided, she wasn\u2019t going to let him kiss her again. Or drink her blood. After all, the reason she had demanded he refrain from drinking from her still applied. If he even glanced at her like he was thirsty, she might strip and beg him for more. Just as she\u2019d begged while he had kissed her.</p><p>This way, he wouldn\u2019t make a play for her vein. Which meant she would be able to keep her desires and hormones under control. She hoped.</p><p>\u201cSo ... your kiss was so hot, he wasn\u2019t afraid you\u2019d phone AIR and have them swoop in for a pickup while he napped?\u201d Noelle asked. \u201cGood going, Sans. I\u2019m impressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Though she wasn\u2019t sure she could take credit. He simply wasn\u2019t scared of Ava, AIR, or anything they could throw his way.</p><p>Except ... he trusted her to keep her end of their bargain. So, yeah, Noelle was kind of right. In a way, he believed in her. Baffling. Why would he believe in her? She\u2019d stabbed him, for God\u2019s sake.</p><p>\u201cWant me to kick him out?\u201d Noelle asked.</p><p>Ava fell into the chair across from her friend. \u201cNo.\u201d Maybe she was just as brain-damaged as McKell, but she liked the thought of him here. Especially in her bed. Later, after she kicked him out herself, she could lie down and pretend to sleep, wrapped in his lingering heat.</p> <p>\u201cGonna say anything to Mia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d She explained her deal with McKell, her vampire-hunting aid in exchange for his willingness to speak with Mia, and Noelle grinned the entire time.</p><p>\u201cAva Sans. Are you in love? Because I have never\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she screeched. She gulped and lowered her voice. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not in love.\u201d She liked to think she was open to the possibly of one day falling in love, but she couldn\u2019t even spend an entire night with a guy. She always ran at the first sign of commitment. Hell, she ran before the first sign.</p><p>She\u2019d never found anyone worth the, well, work that always came with coupledom. Work that would ultimately lead to failure.</p><p>Someone always walked away. That\u2019s just how people were. Kids left their parents, husbands left their wives, and wives left their husbands. Boyfriends and girlfriends realized they weren\u2019t right for each other, saw someone prettier, sluttier, smarter, wealthier\u2014pick your poison\u2014and cut their losses. No one stayed together until the bitter end. And who would want to? Bitter ends sucked. So why not get what you needed while the getting was good, and then say good-bye before a single bad memory took root?</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve never bargained with a bad guy before, either,\u201d Noelle said, dragging her from those dark, hopeless musings.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a bad guy.\u201d Wait. What? \u201cI mean, he\u2019s a bad guy, he\u2019s just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. No take-backs. You think he\u2019s special.\u201d Noelle\u2019s grin widened. \u201cAnd let\u2019s be honest. Only a girl in love would say that a guy like McKell is as pure and warm as the sun outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you shut up? I never said anything about the sun. And why are you here, anyway?\u201d</p><p>Noelle allowed the subject change without comment. \u201cTwo reasons. A few agents are meeting for beers in a little while, and I wanted you to go with me. But you\u2019re busy, so I\u2019m not even going to ask.\u201d She stood and pointed to an overstuffed bag beside Ava\u2019s chair. \u201cSecond reason. I brought you my laundry. You got McKell, after all. Oh, and please remember. Light on the starch. And do yourself a favor and look everything over before you head to Suds and Bubbles. I hid a prezzie for you in between the costumes.\u201d With that, she let herself out of the apartment, leaving Ava alone.</p><p>With the laundry. And the vampire.</p><p>Dismissed again. By her best friend, no less. \u201cHe came to me, so I don\u2019t have to wash a goddamn thing,\u201d she called, knowing Noelle was long gone.</p><p>\u201cStill talking,\u201d McKell shouted from the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cStill annoying me,\u201d she shouted back.</p><p>Seven</p><p>Dallas Gutierrez tipped back his beer and surveyed the bar. It was dim, crowded with humans and otherworlders, a veritable rainbow of differences, and on every wall was a holoscreen showcasing some kind of sporting event. There were three pool tables, and only seven scantily clad waitress taking care of everyone\u2019s needs. He wasn\u2019t positive, but he was pretty sure he\u2019d nailed every one of those waitresses at some point in the last few months.</p><p>He was positive his friend Devyn had, before marrying his Bride, of course. The alien king\u2014who had once collected women of every species, color, size, and occupation\u2014had gone through a \u201cservice industry\u201d phase. Not to mention the thousands of other phases. Then he\u2019d hitched himself to Bride a few weeks ago and while Dallas liked the powerful vampire well enough, he wished to God she\u2019d stayed home tonight.</p><p>Seriously. All his friends were pussies, pairing off and shit, forgetting they had male friends and needed to do guy stuff. Which was no biggie, really. He didn\u2019t care. Except for the fact that he fucking cared! He\u2019d assumed Devyn would resist commitment forever. Like him. But nooo. Bride had to come along and ruin everything. Now Dallas was on his own. Every damn night. No one to talk to, no one to share his problems with.</p><p>God. He was the pussy now. Was he really jonesing to share his feelings?</p><p>It was just, sleeping around wasn\u2019t fun anymore. He was tired of not knowing his partners\u2019 names, of not caring enough to know their names. He was tired of everyone around him having someone they loved enough to spend eternity with, ditching him completely.</p><p>Eternity. Yep, that\u2019s what Devyn and Bride had to look forward to. Which was why Dallas had asked his friend for one night. Just one damn night for the two of them to hang out like they used to. He specifically remembered telling Devyn to \u201cleave the ball and chain at home.\u201d So, of course, the bastard had interpreted that to mean his little wifey-poo needed to tag along and their sex toys, aka balls and chains, needed to remain in their bedroom.</p><p>Now the couple sat across from him. Cuddling. And a more sickening sight he\u2019d never beheld.</p><p>Good thing he\u2019d issued a few other invitations. Hope for the best, but plan for the worst, had always been his motto. He\u2019d called two Rakans, two trainees, Mia Snow and Hector Dean. All had accepted. No, not true. He\u2019d also called Jaxon Tremain, but the guy was currently on vacation with his wifey-poo. And that was probably for the best. Heads would have rolled otherwise, what with Noelle, Jaxon\u2019s cousin, chasing that damn rabid vampire. She\u2019d almost defeated the bloodsucking bastard, too, and that was a major turn-on.</p><p>No probably about it. Jaxon was gone, and that was for the best. Dallas\u2019s libido would have been a harder blow than Noelle\u2019s job. Shitty pun intended.</p><p>Dallas\u2019s gaze shifted down the rest of the table. The Rakans were new hires, golden-skinned warriors with the ability to spirit-walk. Meaning, they could push their conscious minds out of their bodies, and watch and listen to all kinds of things without anyone the wiser.</p><p>Hector was bald, muscled, and had an arm sleeved with tattoos. He was friendly to guys, but ice-cold to women. Not in a gay way, but in an I\u2019m-too-violent-for-the-weaker-sex kind of way.</p><p>Dallas liked him. Only one thing kept him from recruiting the agent as his new best friend, but he wasn\u2019t going to think about that now. He\u2019d punch someone. Namely Hector.</p><p>The trainees were\u2014shit, Dallas had forgotten their names. They were brothers, and both in their early twenties. One was blond (supposedly), handsome, and cocky as shit, and the other was blond, ugly, and mean as shit. They were\u2014</p><p>Uh-oh. His problem with Hector had just walked into the bar. Looked like he\u2019d be thinking about her, after all. Again.</p><p>Dallas Junior twitched.</p><p>Down, boy.</p><p>Noelle Tremain sauntered up to their table, tall, elegant, and pure rebellion. She wore a pair of skin-tight jeans, boots that hit her knees, and a top made from what could only be dental floss. Brown hair hung to her shoulders, straight as a pin, in a chic cut that looked tousled rather than subdued and had probably cost her a fortune. Her gray eyes were bright yet guarded. Playful yet unwelcoming. She picked her friends with care.</p><p>Rich as she was, she probably had to. Lots of people would have loved to use her. His body was one of them. Don\u2019t think like that.</p><p>\u201cI know I wasn\u2019t officially invited,\u201d she said in her smoker\u2019s voice, earning another twitch, \u201cbut I was positive no one would mind if I joined.\u201d</p><p>She nudged a place for herself between the Devyn-Bride tangle of limbs and one of the in-training brothers before anyone could tell her to get lost. Not that anyone would have dared to do so. Girl was unpredictable in her tempers. And violent. God, was she violent. The thing he liked about her, though, was that a man never had to wonder where he stood with her. You pissed her off, she\u2019d tell you. Hard. Usually with her knee. There was no making you guess, and no crying\u2014on her part, at least.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Sans?\u201d the handsome brother asked with a leering grin. \u201cAt home in bed?\u201d</p><p>The ugly one punched him in the back of the head.</p><p>Noelle offered the speaker a deadly grin. \u201cOne day, Dear John, you\u2019re gonna wake up, and your penis is gonna be resting on the pillow next to you. Not that you\u2019ll notice its absence, small as it is.\u201d</p><p>Dallas laughed, and yep, there was another twitch.</p><p>Now he remembered, though. The guy\u2019s name was Johnny Deschanel. He\u2019d slept with Ava at the beginning of training, and had bragged every day since. What a moron. Every man with sense knew you didn\u2019t tell your coworkers when you dipped your wick in the company ink. Then you never got to dip again.</p><p>Why had Dallas invited him tonight? Stupid.</p><p>Noelle propped her elbows on the tabletop and peered expectantly at Bride. \u201cSo what do you know about Victor McKell?\u201d</p><p>Bride flicked the length of her black hair over one shoulder, hitting Devyn in the face. At least the conversation forced the couple to stop the embarrassing PDA. \u201cI\u2019ll answer when my shock wears off. This is the first time a strange female has ever sat down and spoken to me rather than my boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHusband. I\u2019m your husband. And darling, we had the exact same reaction,\u201d the Targon replied in his silky smooth voice. Everything about him was smooth, really. Dark hair, inhumanly ocher eyes. Pale, glittery skin that carried the sheen of crushed diamonds. \u201cOnly, I was silent from agony. Does she not recognize my brilliant beauty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI recognized,\u201d Noelle said dryly. \u201cI just thought your wife was prettier.\u201d</p><p>Every man at the table sat up straighter, suddenly straining to hear the rest of the conversation. Girl-on-girl action\u2014hot. Too bad she didn\u2019t mean it. Dallas knew Noelle was into men. Oh, did he know.</p><p>Sometimes he could predict the future. Images would flash through his mind, some changeable, but most set in stone. And a few weeks ago, he\u2019d seen himself in bed with Noelle. Naked, sweaty. Sated.</p><p>That vision had been of the unchangeable variety.</p><p>On one hand, go team Dallas. On the other, a man should have a choice about who he slept with.</p><p>Yeah, Noelle was gorgeous, and yeah, she turned him on. Stupid twitching cock. But damn it, she was his friend\u2019s cousin, and Dallas didn\u2019t do his friends\u2019 family members. Ever. That was the only rule he lived by. The only standard he\u2019d set for his bed partners. And yeah, that meant he was easy.</p><p>But the worst part? The other reason he didn\u2019t want to sleep with Noelle? He\u2019d also had a vision of her in bed with Hector Dean. Not at the same time as him, just to be clear. But if both of them slept with her, they would hate each other. He knew that, too.</p><p>Dallas could share, no problem. He didn\u2019t want to be tied down, and never had. But female-avoiding Hector? Sharing when he finally let his guard down? Laughable. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No question, Noelle was going to end their friendship.</p><p>Sad, really, since Hector was the last single man standing. The last friend Dallas had. Losing him was going to hurt like a son of a bitch.</p><p>His hands fisted on his chair arm as he studied Hector. The agent was watching Noelle, expression blank. No hint of attraction was evident. Still. Dallas sighed. If only that were true. The fact that Hector was looking at her at all said more than any emotion could have.</p> <p>\u201cSo anyway,\u201d Noelle continued. She curled her fingers around Bride\u2019s beer and drained the contents. \u201cYou were telling me about McKell.\u201d</p><p>A few masculine groans blended in a chorus of disappointment.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why I was doing that,\u201d Bride said dryly. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about him.\u201d</p><p>Noelle arched a dark brow. \u201cYou were engaged to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, as a child. Then my memory was wiped clean, and I was sent to live here. We\u2019ve chatted a few times, but I promise you, I know nothing about him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd what she does know, she isn\u2019t impressed by,\u201d Devyn added firmly.</p><p>Bride just lifted her empty beer bottle and waved it under Devyn\u2019s nose. \u201cBe a good boy and fetch me another drink.\u201d</p><p>She only drank red wine and blood, but Dallas knew she liked to blend in, so she was pretending to throw back a few cold ones.</p><p>Devyn\u2019s mouth dipped into a pout. \u201cDarling, I can\u2019t. You know how jealous you get when every woman in the room watches my ass as I walk away from you. So, really, by refusing to help you, I\u2019m doing you a favor.\u201d</p><p>Bride rolled her eyes, clearly trying not to smile, and signaled a waitress.</p><p>Devyn placed his hand over his heart and met Dallas\u2019s gaze. \u201cNo need to say it. I\u2019m too good to her, I know.\u201d</p> <p>Like Bride, Dallas found himself trying not to grin. How did the bastard get away with the ego and the laziness? If Dallas had said something like that to one of his dates, he would have been slapped.</p><p>A new beer was promptly delivered. Bride didn\u2019t drink it, of course, but Devyn did, aiding her illusion. They were both enablers.</p><p>\u201cSo ... tell me about vampire weaknesses, then,\u201d Noelle said. She reached over, grabbed a few cashews from the bowl in the center of the table, and tossed them into her mouth. \u201cReal ones, not shit from myths.\u201d</p><p>Bride shrugged, leaning back against her man. \u201cI\u2019m not the best source of information for that. I, well, I don\u2019t have any weaknesses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue story,\u201d Devyn said with pride.</p><p>\u201cAnd I only recently learned there were other vampires out there,\u201d Bride continued. \u201cI haven\u2019t spent a lot of time with them. They weren\u2019t exactly welcoming when I visited them underground.\u201d</p><p>Noelle scrubbed a hand down her pretty face. \u201cYou\u2019re so not helping.\u201d</p><p>Dallas risked another glance at Hector. Man was still watching Noelle, expression still blank. He\u2019d wanted so badly to be wrong, but he\u2019d been battling these types of visions for over a year now, and not a single one had failed to come to pass. He was going to sleep with Noelle, even knowing the outcome, and then Hector was going to sleep with Noelle.</p> <p>\u201cDo you think we failed to talk to Bride while filling out McKell\u2019s file?\u201d Mia, too, propped her elbows on the table. She sat across from Noelle, allowing her to glare straight into the trainee\u2019s face. \u201cI assure you, everything Bride knows, which amounts to shit, is in his file.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Bride said at the same time an unimpressed Noelle said, \u201cnever hurts to return to a source with follow-up questions.\u201d</p><p>Mia shrugged. \u201cWork the rest of the night, then. But me? I\u2019m relaxing for once.\u201d Her chair skidded behind her as she stood. \u201cThe rest of you can go to hell.\u201d With that, she stomped to the bar.</p><p>Dallas was positive he heard every person at the table utter a quick prayer for the safe and speedy return of Mia\u2019s husband. She always morphed into Cranky McBitch when Kyrin was out of town. And as he\u2019d only departed for a meeting with his people, the Arcadians, this morning, and planned to be gone for seven days, the next seven days were going to be long and torturous.</p><p>Bride regarded Noelle intently. \u201cMcKell giving you trouble or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me.\u201d She waved her fingers. \u201cSee, I still have these. He\u2019s messing with Ava. No one messes with my Ava.\u201d</p><p>The Rakans, who\u2019d been without female companionship for two years before settling here on Earth, watched her with utter adoration. Her Ava? She had to know what kind of reaction that kind of statement would get, but she blithely continued munching on those cashews.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Bride furrowed her brow, the picture of confusion and disappointment. \u201cHe cut off her fingers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, nothing like that.\u201d Noelle licked the salt from her nails, and Dallas moaned, deciding he and Hector were technically only acquaintances. \u201cBut he\u2019s got to be screwing with her mind, you know? He\u2019s not pissed at her for stabbing him. And he wants to work with her, even bargained with her.\u201d</p><p>Bride tapped her fingertips against her chin. \u201cHmm. That is odd. Usually he erupts with the slightest provocation.\u201d</p><p>Yeah. A real conundrum. \u201cHe wants to sleep with her,\u201d Dallas said. They acted as if they\u2019d never met a man with a penis.</p><p>Johnny, he noticed, leaned forward to listen to the rest of the conversation, gaze sharp.</p><p>Bride asked for details about the bargain, but Noelle refused to give them. She loved her friend, and wouldn\u2019t betray her confidence, even for answers of her own. Great. Something else to like about her. Exactly what he hadn\u2019t needed.</p><p>\u201cIs it true that vampires can\u2019t go out during the day?\u201d Noelle asked.</p><p>\u201cNot necessarily.\u201d Green eyes hardened, and it was clear Bride didn\u2019t like discussing her people. But she did it. Anything for her precious Devyn, who sometimes worked for AIR. What would it be like to have someone care that much? Dallas wondered. \u201cWe burn easily, so we like to avoid the sunlight, but we don\u2019t burst into flame or anything like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you heal quickly? Faster than humans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Noelle\u2019s head tilted to the side. \u201cSo what does it mean if you don\u2019t heal quickly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat there\u2019s not enough AB negative in my diet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it? The only problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>Now it was Noelle\u2019s eyes that hardened, turning the gray to steel. \u201cAnd when you\u2019re hungry, you\u2019ll eat anything?\u201d</p><p>Dallas cast another glance to Hector, expecting to see more of the same. A blank mask. Only, his friend had his beer poised at his lips, his gaze gobbling up Noelle with massive amounts of heat. Had thoughts of biting and sucking pushed him over the edge?</p><p>Didn\u2019t matter, really. Here it was, unadulterated proof that Hector wanted Noelle.</p><p>I\u2019ll fight her appeal, Dallas thought, determined. No matter what the vision promised, he could control his body. He could say no. Even if Noelle stripped and straddled him while he was tied to a chair, slipping and sliding, begging\u2014and shit. None of that, you gutter-loving bastard.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, no,\u201d Bride said. \u201cOnce I met Devyn, I couldn\u2019t drink from anyone but him. If I tried, I vomited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd can you blame her?\u201d Devyn grinned like a man who had just experienced the best orgasm of his life. \u201cMy blood is the best.\u201d</p><p>Wasn\u2019t bragging when you spoke the truth. Dallas had no designs on the guy, but if either one of them had been a woman, Dallas would have tapped that. Confidence really flipped his lid.</p><p>\u201cMated vampires can\u2019t drink from anyone else,\u201d Bride added. \u201cWhether the blood\u2019s good. Or bad.\u201d</p><p>Devyn clutched his heart as if he\u2019d been stabbed.</p><p>\u201cI wonder if there\u2019s a way to force the mating ...\u201d Noelle said, mind obviously drifting.</p><p>Johnny tried to gain her attention, but failed. Did he want to know more about Ava and McKell? Probably. Moron, Dallas thought again. Like there was any way the asshole would get a chance with those goods again. Ava wasn\u2019t stupid. Plus, the few times Dallas had seen her with Johnny, her disgust had been palpable.</p><p>Johnny would have better luck with a nice girl from church. Really, McKell was a stone-cold killer, and Dallas wasn\u2019t even sure he could handle Ava. Girl was a man-eater. And man-eaters were dangerous. Real dangerous. Junior twitched again.</p><p>Maybe Dallas should make a play for\u2014he jumped to his feet with a curse. Everyone\u2019s attention swung to him, but he didn\u2019t care. The Sch\u00f6n queen had just materialized behind Johnny and was now tracing her fingertip along his shoulder. The trainee didn\u2019t seem to notice, was still snapping his fingers for Noelle\u2019s attention.</p><p>The queen\u2019s navy gaze locked on Dallas.</p><p>For a seemingly endless moment, he was paralyzed. Never had there been a more beautiful woman. She was petite in every way, almost delicate, like a china doll, with long, pale hair and utterly flawless skin. While looking at her, all a man wanted to do was protect her. After screwing her senseless, of course.</p><p>Breathe, damn it. Protecting and screwing her should be the last things on his mind. She had destroyed planets. Ruined countless civilizations. All without a single shred of remorse. And she did it through sex, by hitting men where they couldn\u2019t resist. Whoever she screwed became infected with her disease. And if the infected male didn\u2019t constantly infect others, in turn, he died.</p><p>It was a vicious, never-ending cycle.</p><p>Dallas had met her once before, on the day she\u2019d come to this planet. He\u2019d tried to kill her, failed, nearly allowed her to seduce him, despite everything he knew about her, and had battled midnight fantasies ever since. Fantasies that left him hard and aching and moaning for one little kiss of her lips.</p><p>God, she was gorgeous. And looked so soft. Smelled like fresh, dewy roses. And would probably taste like\u2014</p><p>Fuck. She\u2019s evil incarnate. Don\u2019t forget.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve finally returned for you,\u201d she said in a smoky voice that rivaled Noelle\u2019s. She glided forward, closing the distance between them, tracing her fingers along Hector\u2019s scalp as she passed him. Like Johnny, he seemed oblivious.</p><p>\u201cGet your fucking hands off him,\u201d Dallas snarled. He didn\u2019t mind the threat to himself. But to his friends? Hell, no. He wanted to race to her, choke her, watch her eyes close and her body flop uselessly, but he remained where he was.</p><p>With anyone else, he could have moved faster than the speed of light and attacked. He could have gotten into her head and forced her to do anything he wished. Sadly, with her, he was as human as he\u2019d been before Mia\u2019s husband had healed him, changed him. His \u201cpowers\u201d simply didn\u2019t work.</p><p>How? How did she render him so ... ineffective?</p><p>He\u2019d once cursed his abilities, hadn\u2019t wanted them, had thought they made him alien. Now, when he could have used them to save the goddamn world, he cursed the fact that he didn\u2019t have them.</p><p>\u201cUh, Dallas,\u201d Bride said, standing and waving her hand in front of his face. \u201cWho are you talking to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho am I talking to?\u201d His eyes nearly bugged out of his head. \u201cWho do you think I\u2019m talking\u2014\u201d He pressed his lips together as understanding dawned. The boys hadn\u2019t felt the queen. That had to mean they couldn\u2019t see her, either.</p><p>No reason to alarm anyone. And no reason to anger the queen\u2014what was her name?\u2014by mentioning her presence and possibly sending her fleeing. Not before he\u2019d had a chance to kill her.</p><p>This time, he wouldn\u2019t fail.</p><p>Grinning, the queen wiggled her fingers at him. \u201cCome, Dallas. Let\u2019s go outside. Chat.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI need some air,\u201d he told his friends. When Hector made to stand, as if to join him, Dallas shook his head. \u201cAlone,\u201d he added. Then he stalked off without any more explanation, following the object of his hatred.</p><p>She reached the bar\u2019s front door, but didn\u2019t stop to open it. She merely walked through it, like a ghost. His stomach clenched. Maybe she was a ghost. A ghost who could take corporeal form for sex. And wasn\u2019t that just an utterly peachy thought? One, the pyre-gun at his back would be useless. And two, killing her would only be possible while sentencing himself to death.</p><p>He stomped outside. The sun was setting, the sky a hazy pink and purple, the air warm. Wonderland, the bar, sat in the middle of a strip club and a Taco Bell, so there was plenty of traffic coming and going through the parking lot.</p><p>The queen didn\u2019t stop until they stood between two of the metal buildings, hidden in the shadows. Dallas expected several of her soldiers to jump out and grab him\u2014bitch always had her soldiers nearby\u2014but all remained calm. That he could see.</p><p>He met her gaze, her beautiful, mesmerizing gaze, and felt himself melting, edging closer to\u2014no, no, no. Grunting, he settled his weight on his heels. She\u2019s the enemy. He\u2019d remind himself as many times as necessary. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>Her white dress billowed in the breeze, caressing her. \u201cI\u2019m here for you,\u201d she said, matter-of-factly. Just then, her voice was almost childlike. Innocent, full of wonder.</p><p>Enemy. \u201cAnd what do you want with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name is Trinity,\u201d she said, ignoring him. She frowned, again almost childlike, only this time in a way that reminded him of a kid who hadn\u2019t gotten the lollipop she wanted. \u201cNot that you asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr cared,\u201d he lied. Trinity. Merely a name, like his, or was there a deeper meaning to it? Any other name, and he wouldn\u2019t have wondered, but the literal translation of trinity was three. There was the woman, the disease, and ... what? Something else? Something worse? His stomach did that clenching thing again. \u201cYour soldiers are infecting my people. I want you gone.\u201d Forever. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>How to do it, though? He withdrew his gun, and she might disappear before a single shot was fired off. Not that he even knew if that shot would burn her or mist through her like she\u2019d done the door. Only one way to find out ...</p><p>He had to touch her.</p><p>One step, two, he slowly moved toward her.</p> <p>One step, two, she slowly backed away from him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about your people, I truly am, but I need my men strong.\u201d</p><p>Careful. He stilled. \u201cTheir strength comes at a very destructive price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She stilled, as well.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re okay with that?\u201d As he tangled his hand through his hair, he stealthily took another step.</p><p>This time, she remained in place. \u201cI have to be.\u201d Tears filled her eyes, turning them into blue pools of sadness. Startling, against her paling skin.</p> <p>Should he clap for such a stellar performance now or later? \u201cWe found a cure, you know. You won\u2019t destroy this planet like you\u2019ve done to so many others.\u201d Another step.</p><p>Again she remained in place. \u201cYes. I know all about your cure.\u201d Soft, gentle.</p><p>Of course she knew. Everyone she infected, and everyone they infected, became linked to her. She knew what they knew. Since AIR had captured one of her closest advisers\u2014Nolan\u2014and later healed him with Bride\u2019s blood, she\u2019d known before they had that the guy was on the mend.</p><p>Another step toward her, another and another. Almost ... there ... \u201cAren\u2019t you worried?\u201d He reached out, so close ...</p><p>In the blink of an eye, she was farther down the alley, increasing the distance between them. Dallas almost shouted, \u201cTo hell with it,\u201d and grabbed his gun. Only the need for more answers kept him quiet and still.</p><p>Damn her. There had to be a way to overpower her, here, now. Steady.</p> <p>\u201cAm I worried that the cure will kill me, since I\u2019m the source of the infection?\u201d She laughed, a tinkling sound. \u201cNo. But are you sure the cure works? Are you sure the disease isn\u2019t hiding, pretending to be eradicated? Waiting for a chance to strike?\u201d</p><p>Junior, the idiot, twitched. That laugh ... Enemy, enemy, enemy. The hair-trigger arousal had to end. And what had happened to her tears? Her eyes were now dry, color blooming prettily in her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, determined to try again. One step, two. \u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t bait him into believing otherwise.</p><p>All of Nolan\u2019s symptoms had vanished. The desire to eat human flesh, the oozing sores that had covered his body, the gray, flaking skin and total loss of hair. And since the disease was a living, mindless being, with a never-ending hunger, constantly growing until it had outgrown its host and required the excess to be drained into another vessel, there was no way it could \u201cpretend\u201d to be gone.</p><p>He mentioned none of that, however. Let her think she\u2019d convinced him. \u201cWhat do you want from me, Trinity?\u201d he asked again, even as he continued to move toward her.</p><p>\u201cI wish to speak to your leader.\u201d</p><p>Oh, really. \u201cShe\u2019s inside the bar.\u201d He stopped, held out his hand, expectant. \u201cCome on. I\u2019ll take you to her right now.\u201d</p><p>Trinity shook her head, blond hair dancing over her arms. \u201cYou will be my ambassador,\u201d she said. \u201cI will speak through you.\u201d</p> <p>His arm fell heavily to his side. Dread washed through him, chilling his blood. \u201cAnd just how will you speak through me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll infect you.\u201d A return of the sadness, as if she cared, hurt for him.</p><p>She meant to control him through the mental link, he realized. Now he backed away from her. No distance would be great enough. \u201cNot just no, but hell, no.\u201d If she turned on the charm, if she sent her guard to hold him down, he would ... what? Fuck! No answers. He had no answers.</p><p>Her eyelids slitted, dark lashes fusing together. \u201cYou will cave in this matter, Dallas.\u201d Hard, determined.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he grated. \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s test your resolve, then, shall we? For every week that you deny me, I will personally infect one of your friends. Beginning tonight ...\u201d Without another word, she disappeared.</p><p>Leaving him alone with her threat. A threat he had no doubt she would see through.</p><p>Eight</p><p>The hunger woke him.</p><p>Terrible pains clawed through McKell\u2019s body, first tearing out of his stomach, then ripping his ribs apart, then entering his bloodstream and turning every cell he possessed into a dagger. He hurt, ached, throbbed. Too ... much ... His fangs were sharpened, ready, his lips bleeding. He must have gnashed them in his sleep, trying to feed from himself.</p><p>He\u2019d woken up hungry before, but never like this. As if he could die at any moment. Why had he now?</p><p>He forced his focus past the pain and took stock, gaze cataloging his surroundings. Small bedroom. Moonlight seeped past the slatted window. Pictures of Ava and Noelle hung on the wall. In them, the two were smiling, flipping off the camera, or standing over unconscious people they\u2019d obviously beaten to pulp.</p><p>Mmm, pulp. The pain broke free, once again agonizing him.</p><p>Concentrate. Clearly, he was still in Ava\u2019s home. He recalled coming here, insisting she doctor him, and then deciding to \u201cnap\u201d in her bed. Partially to piss her off, and partially because he hadn\u2019t wanted to brave the sunlight again. He\u2019d never meant to actually fall asleep. Had thought to put distance between them, yet keep her close, while his body healed and his mind centered.</p><p>The moment he\u2019d climbed into this bed and realized that her butterscotch scent infused the sheets, his shaft had hardened, plaguing him, demanding he stomp out of the bedroom, find her, and finally have her. All of her. Body, blood. Devotion. He\u2019d resisted, assuming the lust alone would keep him awake.</p><p>Lust he still didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>Well, right now he did. Not only was Ava beneath him\u2014mmm, beneath him\u2014she was over him, beside him, surrounding him. Damned covers! His cock hardened once more, desire sparking back to dazzling life and chasing away some of the pain. But why her? he wondered for the thousandth time since meeting her. She was contrary, argumentative, violent, and determined to lock him away.</p><p>Because she had agreed to help him? Not that he fully trusted her in that matter. But no, that made no sense. He\u2019d wanted her before her agreement. Wanted her for more than his master plan.</p><p>A plan that still involved using her scent to attract other vampires. No bloodsucker would be able to resist her. They would smell her, flock to her, and he could swoop in, capture them, and demand the answers he sought. No more hunting them down, only to have them run and hide in this world he hadn\u2019t yet learned how to navigate.</p><p>\u201cMcKell,\u201d Ava suddenly shouted.</p><p>Danger! She was in danger.</p><p>He was off the bed and rushing into the kitchen a moment later. He expected to find her injured or battling an intruder. Instead, she sat at the kitchen table, calmly sipping sweetened coffee.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he snarled, panting, hurting again, desperate to destroy whatever had scared her. His mouth watered, and his claws sprang out. He would rip into\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lazy. You slept all damn day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you are unharmed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. What made you think I would be harmed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, you\u2019re lazy. I took exception.\u201d</p><p>Deep breath in, deep breath out. He swallowed the excess moisture and retracted his claws. Another deep breath, and he was calm enough to claim the chair across from her. \u201cI was healing.\u201d And he wasn\u2019t yet at full strength. Besides the overwhelming hunger, there was still a twinge in his side where she\u2019d stabbed him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lame excuse. Admit it. You\u2019re lazy.\u201d</p><p>Though he wanted to shake her for maligning his character, he merely studied her. She\u2019d pulled her curls into a twist, exposing the elegant length of her neck. At the base, her pulse fluttered exquisitely. Mouth ... watering ... again ... She wore a black T-shirt, faded jeans, and tennis shoes. Average clothing on a far from average body. Those curves were sinful.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry,\u201d he said, voice raw, coarse. Too easily did he recall how delicious she\u2019d tasted. How strong she\u2019d made him feel from just those sips. How much stronger would she make him if he drained her? \u201cFeed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Another swallow of that coffee, her throat moving sensually. \u201cAnd don\u2019t forget our bargain. You don\u2019t drink from me unless I say it\u2019s okay. And I haven\u2019t. Said it\u2019s okay, that is.\u201d</p><p>Stupidest bargain he\u2019d ever made. But then, he hadn\u2019t realized he would wake up in this pathetic state. And even if he had, food shouldn\u2019t have a choice. Humans didn\u2019t ask vegetables if they felt like being consumed, did they?</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll have to go out,\u201d he said. Now. Before he forgot himself.</p><p>Still calm, she blew into her mug. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to dress first.\u201d She sipped, then settled the cup on the counter.</p><p>He glanced down at himself. Shirtless, necklace bloodstained, stitches on display, bandage long gone. Pants ripped and dirty. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll shower, and you order a pizza.\u201d That would save him time and effort.</p><p>She blinked over at him, confused. \u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but I am.\u201d</p><p>Another few blinks. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have to remind you of this, but you don\u2019t eat food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I do eat the delivery boys and girls.\u201d Something he\u2019d never attempted before, but Maureen\u2014damn it, Bride Targon\u2014during one of his brief conversations with her, had assured him delivery people were \u201ctasty.\u201d He only wished he could rely on Bride for the rest of his needs. Not for information, but for blood and sex.</p><p>Except, his hunger and desire actually waned at the thought of drinking from and sleeping with her. Ava, however ... hello, renewed desire. He frowned. Anyway. He couldn\u2019t rely on Bride for anything. Though she\u2019d lived on the surface most of her life, she had never tried to blend with humans during daylight hours, so she couldn\u2019t help him do so. Plus, her husband was an ass who wanted McKell\u2019s heart on a platter, and rarely allowed them to interact.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014you\u2014argh!\u201d Ava pounded her fist against the tabletop, rattling her coffee and sending creamy liquid over the rim of the cup. Her dark eyes were blazing, and he realized she\u2019d never been as calm as she\u2019d wanted him to believe. She was angry. Why? Because he wanted to eat someone else?</p><p>No, he thought next. This anger was far too strong, too deeply rooted, for that. But he wouldn\u2019t concern himself with pondering the answer; it didn\u2019t matter. They were using each other. Nothing more. Learning about her wasn\u2019t on the agenda.</p><p>\u201cJust make the call,\u201d he said, standing.</p><p>\u201cHell, no. One, I\u2019m not springing for a pizza I won\u2019t eat, and two, no one will ever deliver here again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one will ever know what happened.\u201d</p><p>A muscle ticked below her eye. \u201cHow will you make them forget?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll command them to do so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019ll work?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cProve it.\u201d</p><p>The Voice came easily to most vampires. McKell, not so much. He\u2019d struggled his entire life. He could use it, but he had to concentrate. He didn\u2019t know why.</p><p>Rather than argue and use up what remained of his strength, he peered deeply into Ava\u2019s eyes, those dark, fathomless eyes, and held out his hand. He focused, drew on his resolve, his will, let it rise up and spill from his lips. \u201cTake my hand,\u201d he commanded, his voice low, a hum of power in the undercurrent.</p><p>A gasp left her as her arm lifted, shaking, halting every few inches, as if she fought each movement. Finally, her fingers made contact with his, and another gasp left her. And hell, he gasped, too. Such warm, soft skin she had. Where they touched, he sizzled.</p><p>His hunger intensified. Do not grab her. Do not bite her. He forced his arm to fall to his side, severing contact. Do not groan. \u201cProven. Now make the damn call.\u201d He turned away. One step, two.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you command Noelle and me to leave the woods that first night?\u201d she said, stopping him.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to see what you would do.\u201d Besides, he\u2019d had no intention of showing all his weapons during the first battle.</p><p>With that thought, he realized he\u2019d always meant to see her again. What the hell was wrong with him? She. Was. Food.</p><p>At last, he stalked away from her and into the bathroom. Distance, that\u2019s what he needed. And time to think. Like that helped before. Scowling, he programmed the enzyme shower, something he\u2019d learned to use on the streets of New Chicago, and stepped inside. In seconds, the dry spray cleaned his skin, his wound, and even his pants.</p><p>When he emerged and entered the bedroom, Ava sat at the edge of the mattress, the bed now made, not a wrinkle in the comforter. She was glaring at him.</p><p>\u201cWhen will the pizza arrive?\u201d He hadn\u2019t meant to snap at her, but damn it, he was on edge. And those few minutes apart hadn\u2019t really cooled his desire for her. Still. Seeing her, being near her, eased him somewhat. Not the hunger, never that, but the pain.</p><p>Stubborn, always stubborn, she crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cI didn\u2019t call.\u201d</p><p>He stopped in front of her, forcing her to look up ... up ... up. \u201cIs this a power play, Ava? Because I assure you, you won\u2019t win.\u201d As he spoke, his own sense of anger rose. White-hot, blistering. \u201cDo you think to keep me weak? Expecting AIR to bust in and cart me away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>Could he believe her? Yes or no, that brought up another question. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you call AIR?\u201d Noelle had asked the same\u2014his sensitive hearing had tuned into their entire conversation\u2014but Ava had never really answered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre we sharing excerpts from our diaries now? Do you want to tell me why you picked me, the girl who stabbed you? And don\u2019t give me that bullshit about my owing you.\u201d She was breathing heavily, blood rushing through her veins.</p><p>She was like a lick of flame, and he was the kindling. Touch her again ... kiss her ... taste her ... He leaned down, needing her, desperate, lost\u2014</p><p>\u201cMcKell,\u201d she rasped. \u201cAnswer.\u201d</p> <p>He straightened with a jerk, then stepped away. They hadn\u2019t so much as brushed against each other, but his skin was sizzling again. All over. If he wasn\u2019t careful, he would be on her.</p><p>\u201cNo, we are not going to share our diary excerpts now. We\u2019re going to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Ava followed McKell through the winding hallways of her building, painfully aware of the plain gray walls, the scratches in the metal and brick, the dirt staining the concrete floors, and then outside, into the cooling night air. Garbage bags lined the sidewalks. Pickup was tomorrow. The scents of rotting food wafted, among other indelicate things, and her cheeks heated.</p> <p>Doesn\u2019t matter. This was home. He could deal.</p><p>Where the hell was he going, anyway? He was still shirtless, that bone necklace clanging with his every step, and people were staring. Male, female, didn\u2019t matter. The males recognized a threat, and the females spotted possible prey. Unable to stop herself, Ava hissed at them all.</p><p>Finally, in front of a nearby alley, he settled and crooked his finger at a woman across the street. The woman was alone, carrying two grocery bags, but that didn\u2019t dissuade her from crossing the street as if in a trance. Maybe she was. The bastard had powers Ava hadn\u2019t known about. He\u2019d told her to place her hand in his, and she hadn\u2019t been able to prevent herself from doing so.</p><p>If he had told her to stab herself, she would have done that, too.</p><p>He was far more dangerous than she\u2019d realized. Far sexier, too.</p><p>When he\u2019d told her\u2014so superiorly\u2014that he was hungry, she\u2019d wanted to jump up on the table and become his buffet. All you can eat. To have all that power at her fingertips ... demanding everything ... Oh, yes. Far more dangerous.</p> <p>Power was an aphrodisiac to Ava. And the thought of people seeing them together, thinking she had been the one female to tame him, to gentle him, God, it was tempting. The pride she would feel ... the respect she would gain, she might never know it\u2019s equal.</p><p>The shame, too. She wouldn\u2019t have tamed him, gentled him. No one would ever be able to do so. And he was a criminal, she reminded herself. A target of AIR. If she needed the reminder a thousand times, she\u2019d issue the reminder a thousand and one. She didn\u2019t need her coworkers laughing at her, telling her how easy she was. Even though the females would be jealous. No question.</p><p>Joking with Noelle about nailing him, fine. But forever being labeled the agent who slept with her targets? No, thank you. She\u2019d told herself that before, but the possibility hadn\u2019t been as ... imminent then. He\u2019d stood in front of her, the bed behind her, desire heating her up, and she\u2019d again fought the urge to offer herself to him. However he wanted her.</p><p>Only thing that had stopped her then was the thought that he would reduce her to a meal. A walking cup of joe. Nothing more, nothing less. The way he\u2019d sneered about the pizza delivery boy ... his disdain for \u201cfood\u201d had never been clearer, and it had been pretty clear before. Her hands fisted.</p><p>\u201cYou better not kill her,\u201d Ava gritted out.</p><p>\u201cBelieve me. She\u2019ll love what I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBraggart.\u201d Bastard. And if the bitch tried for anything more than a one-way transfusion, she\u2019d lose her tongue. Tongue necklaces were probably a lot prettier than finger necklaces.</p><p>\u201cI spoke only the truth.\u201d</p> <p>Shouldn\u2019t he demand that Ava feed him? she wondered again.</p><p>I thought you wanted to be more than a food source.</p><p>She did. That didn\u2019t mean he shouldn\u2019t fight for her capitulation. Not that she\u2019d give it. But if anyone was going to love something McKell did, it should be Ava. He owned her room and board. Well, maybe not board. Now, though, she couldn\u2019t protest what he was about to do. She\u2019d seem weak; he\u2019d realize how close she was\u2014no, had been\u2014to giving in. She was stronger now. Really.</p><p>The woman reached him, and he tugged her deep into the alley, his gaze detached. Ava followed, studying. The woman was taller than her by several inches, though dressed just as plainly in jeans and a white T-shirt. She had blond hair, cut to frame her pointed chin. Sharp cheekbones, a blade of a nose. Pretty, in an aristocratic kind of way.</p><p>Did McKell favor that kind of look?</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t come when a man summons you,\u201d Ava snapped at her. Just to be helpful, as she often was. It had nothing to do with raging jealousy. \u201cThat kind of makes you a dog.\u201d</p><p>The woman paid her no attention. \u201cHi,\u201d she said to McKell, her voice sultry and inviting. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>McKell backed her up against the brick wall, and Ava\u2019s jaw clenched. \u201cBags,\u201d he said.</p><p>The woman placed her bags at her feet and straightened. McKell gripped her shoulders and swung her around, so that he faced Ava. His fangs were so long they gapped over his bottom lip. They were so white they practically glittered. Ava gulped as her belly quivered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to drink from you, and you\u2019re going to let me,\u201d he said. His gaze never left Ava. \u201cAfterward, you\u2019ll leave me without looking back and never recall what was done.\u201d</p><p>There was that powerful voice, washing over her, causing goose bumps to form on her skin. Her needy, sensitive, aching skin. And somehow, she knew that rubbing all over him was the only way to assuage that ache.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d the woman said on a happy sigh. Her head tilted to the side. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Still McKell\u2019s gaze remained on Ava as he descended, as those teeth sank deep, as his lips moved, as he sucked and sucked and sucked. She expected his hands\u2014those big, gorgeous hands\u2014to caress the woman, but his grip on her shoulders never even loosened.</p><p>Did the female taste better than Ava? Was McKell enjoying himself? She crossed her arms over her chest, and tapped her foot.</p><p>\u201cSometime today,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>He growled like a caged animal.</p><p>Moonlight caressed him, and his violet eyes began to glow. So purple, so beautiful. So hypnotic, dragging her down, drowning her in waves of that neediness. The emerald swirled there, too, and became her lifeline, reminding her of where she was, who she was, who he was, and their purpose. Feeding him.</p><p>Me, me, me. My turn. He really was too beautiful for his own good, she thought, disgusted with herself. Most likely, no woman had ever resisted him. But all that superiority, all that disdain ... no way. Good. Another reminder. Ava couldn\u2019t even make things work with guys who worshipped her. There was no way she\u2019d be able to make things work with McKell. Not that she wanted to make things work with him.</p><p>Having him inside her apartment all the time, messing things up, expecting her to call and check in. No, no, and no. Which was why she was happy as a commitment-phobe.</p><p>Despite her admiration for male power, she liked to be in control of her own life, liked her things where she left them, liked having no one to answer to, and there was nothing wrong with that.</p><p>But what about McKell? What did he like? How many girlfriends had he had? Had he ever been in love with a vampire? A human?</p><p>Finally, he released the woman.</p><p>She stumbled backward, eyes glazed, hand fluttering to her neck. \u201cOh, my,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cThank you.\u201d Then she gathered her bags and sauntered off, as if nothing had happened. As ordered, she never once looked back.</p><p>McKell, too, stumbled back, though the brick wall stopped him from going too far. He stood there a minute, panting, eyes closing, skin ... paling?</p><p>Ava frowned. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer blood must have been poisoned. The first few sips were good, but after that ... and now my stomach hurts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. Poisoned how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Without any more warning, he hunched over and vomited.</p><p>Ava spun, giving him as much privacy as she could. Over and over he retched. Maybe she was as cruel and wicked as her mother had always said, because a part of her was glad that woman\u2019s blood wouldn\u2019t be flowing through his veins all night.</p><p>\u201cThis ever happened before?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cA few times,\u201d he said, spitting. \u201cLately.\u201d</p><p>Great. Maybe he was sick, rather than poisoned. But just how did one find out? Human doctors, even otherworlder doctors, had never dealt with vampires.</p><p>First things first. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but still hungry.\u201d</p><p>Nothing she could do about that just yet. She didn\u2019t want him vomiting her blood, too. \u201cJust ... stay here, okay.\u201d</p><p>He protested, but was too weak to follow as she raced to the pharmacy two blocks away. There she bought him an \u201cOur Meds Are Best\u201d T-shirt and a bottle of mouthwash. She was huffing and sweating by the time she returned, but he was exactly where she\u2019d left him.</p><p>\u201cBy the way, you owe me twenty-seven forty-eight,\u201d she told him, handing him both items.</p><p>\u201cAnd you owe me a meal.\u201d He tugged on the shirt. The material was tight, straining against his biceps. He should have looked ridiculous, but just looked sweeter, as if he didn\u2019t take himself too seriously.</p><p>She tucked his necklace under the collar, and he used the mouthwash, rising several times for several minutes. While he couldn\u2019t speak, she said, \u201cI owe you? Really? I came with you to find someone. I stood by silent and patient while you ate. So how is your lack of sustenance my fault?\u201d</p><p>He spit the final mouthful onto the already filthy concrete and glared down at her. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It just is.\u201d</p><p>Irrational shit. \u201cYou sound like Noelle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019re now best friends?\u201d he asked drily. \u201cFinally, I can die a happy man.\u201d</p><p>At least his warped sense of humor had returned. \u201cLet\u2019s be honest. We\u2019re hardly friends at all. I mean, I can barely stand you.\u201d Okay, that was harsh, even for her. There was no time to apologize, though. Fine. There was time; she simply opted not to use it. She could still picture his teeth inside that woman\u2019s vein.</p><p>His eyes narrowed, but not enough to hide the challenge suddenly banked there. \u201cYou like me. I know it.\u201d</p><p>She tried not to shiver. \u201cWhat makes you so sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m strong, courageous, and handsome. What\u2019s not to like?\u201d</p><p>I like. \u201cYou just described about a thousand people I know.\u201d</p><p>He chomped his teeth at her. \u201cYes, but none are vampires.\u201d</p><p>And were therefore unworthy? Hello, renewed superiority. \u201cFangs do not make the man, you know.\u201d Before he could reply, before she could start shivering again, she added, \u201cSo where are we going to round up those other vampires?\u201d The sooner their association ended, the sooner the madness ended.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t round anyone up until I eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if the next human is ... poisoned?\u201d What she really wanted to say: what if you\u2019re too sick to keep anyone down?</p><p>He scrubbed a hand down his face. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook. Just tell me where to go and what to do. You can return to my apartment, rest, rejuvenate, whatever, and I\u2019ll bag and tag you a vampire.\u201d Boom. Done.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d As his denial echoed between them, his violet irises once again glowed. \u201cPromise me you will never chase a vampire without me.\u201d</p><p>Great. They weren\u2019t even in a relationship, and he was already issuing orders. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He splayed his arms, as if he were the last sane man and dealing with a roomful of senseless women. \u201cBecause I said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well, in that case ... fuck you. Find me when you grow a brain.\u201d She gave him a pinkie wave and a smile and turned away, then strode out of the shadows and onto the moonlit sidewalk. Like his meal, she never glanced back.</p><p>Thankfully, he followed, and was soon keeping pace at her side. \u201cDo you not realize the fire you play with, human? I\u2019m your superior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you felt that way!\u201d No longer was he content to merely hint about it, either.</p><p>\u201cOf course you did. I made no secret of the truth. How could I, when it\u2019s so obvious?\u201d</p><p>Red suddenly dotted her vision, and she had trouble drawing in a breath. Well, a breath that wasn\u2019t laced with \u201cfire.\u201d She forgot their bargain, forgot that the man had just vomited his guts and might be dying from some horrible vampire sickness. \u201cI\u2019m gonna teach you just how inferior you are, you bastard!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck.\u201d</p><p>Oh, he would pay for that.</p><p>Ava removed the mini-taser she had stored in her back pocket and jammed it into his neck. His body vibrated, he struggled to speak, gurgled, and then, when she removed her thumb from the \u201cfry\u201d button, he fell to the ground, twitching.</p><p>Ava kept walking.</p><p>Nine</p><p>She had a temper. He knew that. His fault for forgetting.</p><p>Volts of electricity continued to pass through McKell, even though Ava had removed the weapon. His muscles convulsed, locking onto bones, and he could only sit there, immobile, as humans avoided him and Ava increased the distance between them.</p><p>If she thought she could escape him, she would soon learn the impossibility of such a task. She would never be able to escape him. He would always be able to find her. He knew her scent, her taste, the essence of her branded into his every cell.</p><p>But that wasn\u2019t the only reason he would forever be able to find her. His teeth gnashed together as he contemplated the truth. He\u2019d thrown up a meal. Again. And even while drinking from the strange human female, he\u2019d been hungry for Ava. Had almost tossed the woman aside and leapt at her, just to have that curvy body near him, his hands all over her, his teeth\u2014or any part of him\u2014inside her. His possession evident to her, to the world. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d suspected the worst before, but had refused to ponder or worry. Now he knew, and there was no stopping the worry. She belonged to him. She was his. His woman, his mate. Unless he did something about it, he would never again be able to successfully drink from any one but her.</p><p>That was the way of the vampires. When they encountered their mate, the person whose body chemistry best fit their own, they craved that mate and only that mate. No one else could sustain them.</p><p>They could have sex with other people, yes. Not that he wanted anyone but Ava. But food? No. It was Ava\u2019s blood for him, and only Ava\u2019s.</p> <p>That wasn\u2019t a problem for human Ava, of course. She could eat anything she wished. But for McKell? That was a serious fucking problem! His woman was refusing to feed him.</p><p>Unfair, and one of the reasons vampires prayed they never mated with a human. Those prayers were usually answered. To his knowledge only one vampire had ever been paired with a human. Still. He\u2019d deal with the food issue later. The biggest problem right now was the sex thing. He and Ava were a couple, yet Ava was resisting him and could sleep with someone else.</p><p>And she just might. Clearly she didn\u2019t care about McKell. She\u2019d allowed him to drink another woman\u2019s blood, without protest. She\u2019d actually aided him. Why hadn\u2019t she raged? Attacked? Tried to kill the woman for daring to accept her man?</p><p>Damn, damn, damn. Why him? Why a human? A lowly human? He deserved better, damn it!</p><p>He wasn\u2019t the first vampire to despise his mate. Not that he hated Ava, but he didn\u2019t want to live with the stubborn baggage forever. He just wanted to sip from her for a few years. And keep her naked and in his bed for a few decades.</p> <p>God, he was so confused about that woman.</p><p>Thankfully, when he tired of her, he had two methods of bond-breaking to choose from. The first\u2014a potion. He had only to drink it, and his body would forget it had ever smelled Ava, ever touched her or tasted her. But afterward, he would never again be allowed to see her. Never again be allowed near her. The moment he encountered her, his body would remember, rendering the potion useless, and he would be back where he started.</p><p>The second method\u2014death. Not his. Hers. He could kill her, and his body would return to normal. Forever.</p><p>Yet neither method currently appealed to him. He needed her help. Yes, he could have found the other topside vampires on his own. Yes, he could have continued on with his life without her, no problem. But if she was with him, helping him, AIR would leave him alone. At least for a little while.</p><p>Even when they were sending agents into the forest to arrest you, you were entertained, not bothered. He ignored that line of thought. He wanted to be left alone. Of course. Who wouldn\u2019t?</p><p>So. He would continue his association with Ava. As long as she never drank his blood, they would not be officially married, and he could more easily leave her\u2014and find someone else, someone more appropriate\u2014when the time came.</p> <p>\u201cNeed some help, gorgeous?\u201d a female asked him, returning his thoughts to the present.</p><p>He blinked up at her. She\u2019d stopped in front of him, and held out a hand to hoist him up. She was in her mid-thirties, with dark hair, freckles, glasses, and a cute button nose. Innocent, kind, and just begging to be ripped into pieces.</p><p>Humans needed to be more careful about who they attempted to aid. And since he was now living here, it was up to him to instruct them. He hissed at her, revealing the sharpness of his fangs. She yelped, paled, and scampered away.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d he called as he lumbered to his feet.</p><p>He stood there a moment, dizzy, stars winking over his vision, stomach twisting, lungs trying to inflate. So hungry ... But, damn it, the complication hadn\u2019t gone away.</p><p>He\u2019d promised Ava he wouldn\u2019t drink from her without permission. Why had he done such a stupid thing? he wondered again. Until he consumed the vampire potion, she would be the only person he could drink from. He wouldn\u2019t tell her that, of course. She would realize the power she held over him. Knowing her, and he was beginning to think he did, she would exploit that power.</p><p>Therefore, he would have to seduce her and make her willing. McKell sighed, ignoring the anticipation working through him and concentrating on the dread. Dirty work, but a vampire had to do what a vampire had to do.</p><p>Ava held her new cell to her ear. Noelle had given her the small black phone to replace her old one. It was the \u201cprezzie\u201d she\u2019d hidden between the naughty cop and curious kitty costumes, and a relief to find, rather than some kind of vibrator with fangs, which Ava wouldn\u2019t have put past her friend. She vowed to be careful with this one. But as her friend spoke, her fingers clenched so tightly the plastic cracked.</p> <p>\u201cYou want me to what?\u201d Ava demanded, even as she loosened her grip.</p><p>At her outburst, the people walking in front of her glanced back. She frowned at them and motioned for them to turn around and continue along the sidewalk, before snaking a corner to escape their notice.</p><p>\u201cYou heard me. Bring McKell to the bar,\u201d Noelle repeated.</p><p>And place him directly in the line of fire? \u201cNo. No way.\u201d She twisted to the side to avoid colliding with a group of teens headed in the opposite direction.</p><p>She\u2019d entered a newer neighborhood than her own, one of shops rather than apartments, and the streets were far more crowded. Plus, Friday night, everyone was looking for a good time.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Noelle asked.</p><p>\u201cUh, why not?\u201d Bright lights pulsed on her right, a twinkling kaleidoscope of pinks, blues, and greens, blurring together as she raked her brain for an excuse. Lost in thought as she was, she tripped over her own feet. Enough. Scowling, she righted herself and stomped to the nearest building, then leaned against the cold stone. Her heart pounded against her ribs, like a jackhammer against concrete. \u201cJust ... because.\u201d</p><p>There was a crackle of silence. Then, \u201cYou afraid the other agents will whack him?\u201d</p><p>Yes! \u201cNo, of course not. One, he can take care of himself, and two, I don\u2019t care if he lives or dies.\u201d Even saying the words hurt. Die. McKell. He\u2019d been sick, but still she\u2019d tasered him. What kind of person was she? Worse, she\u2019d left him to fend for himself in his weakened condition.</p><p>\u201cLiar. You want to protect him. You lurve him.\u201d</p><p>One of her ribs finally cracked. \u201cI hurt him, Noelle.\u201d Was he okay? He should have recovered by now. Should have tracked her down and screamed at her. Maybe demanded she kiss him all better. But there was no sign of him. Not left, not right, not straight ahead.</p><p>Noelle laughed. \u201cPlease. Whatever you did was foreplay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur definition of foreplay differs greatly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you need to think to make yourself feel better about your love of the rough stuff. So lookit,\u201d her friend added before she could reply. \u201cThe Sch\u00f6n queen was here, and we could really use McKell\u2019s help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Another sighting? Now?</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with your ears tonight? Are you really going to make me repeat everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cContinue or die!\u201d</p><p>Another laugh, wine-rich, like smoke wafting over the line. \u201cHere\u2019s the scoop. That diseased bitch talked to Dallas. Apparently, he was the only one who could see and hear her. Anyway, he\u2019s now put the bar on lockdown, and he and the other agents are interrogating everyone here, finding out what they saw, heard, testing the place, that kind of thing.\u201d</p><p>Ava gulped. Okay. That wasn\u2019t so bad. \u201cAnd we need McKell because...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuh. Because he can stop time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? The queen is long gone by now. What will stopping time help?\u201d Not that it mattered. There was nothing Noelle could say to convince her to escort McKell into a roomful of angry agents. Someone would try to stun him, guaranteed. That would piss off McKell. A hungry, possibly sick McKell.</p><p>A bloodbath would ensue.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t let that happen. She had a bargain to uphold, and she took her bargains very seriously. Even though she had often double-crossed people in the past, never actually fulfilling her end of their bargains. Sometimes you had to cheat to win, and she\u2019d never minded cheating. Winning was important. Never more so than now, but for some reason, she couldn\u2019t talk herself into double-crossing McKell.</p><p>Maybe because she felt guilty for all the harm she\u2019d caused him. Maybe because she hoped to prove that humans weren\u2019t inferior to vampires. In any way. She didn\u2019t know. All she knew was that she wanted him safe.</p><p>Tasering him had been a small ... complication on the road to his safety, but one she would (maybe) apologize for. After he apologized for his attitude.</p><p>Where the hell was he?</p><p>\u201cAre you listening to me?\u201d Noelle asked on a sigh.</p><p>Ava blinked back to focus, and realized she been silent for several minutes. \u201cNo. Sorry. But listen, McKell\u2019s sick. He can\u2019t keep anything down, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. What? Sick how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe just threw up his dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting. Hang on for a sec, K?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? What are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Static filled the line. One minute passed, two, allowing Ava\u2019s imagination to take flight through poisoned clouds and an acid storm. What. The. Hell? Noelle wouldn\u2019t tell the other agents about McKell\u2019s condition. She wouldn\u2019t. Unless she thought she needed to protect Ava. Then nothing would stop her.</p><p>Trembling now, Ava watched for McKell. Still no sign of him, and her heart began pounding for an entirely different reason. What if she\u2019d injured him more than she\u2019d meant? What if someone was even now picking his pockets or stabbing him, and he was unable to defend himself?</p><p>She kicked into gear, heading in the direction she\u2019d left him, the phone still clutched to her ear.</p><p>\u201cI know something you don\u2019t know,\u201d Noelle suddenly said in a happy, singsong voice. \u201cAnd it\u2019s about vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we\u2019d have to force this issue, but looks like your overwhelming appeal took over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? Explain, or I swear to God I\u2019ll burn your mansion down.\u201d She snaked the corner and increased her speed.</p><p>\u201cWith my mother in it?\u201d Noelle asked hopefully.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Too bad. Now I have the need to take this secret to my grave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust tell me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love when you beg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoelle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I think I know why McKell wants to hang out with you so badly.\u201d</p><p>Because she was smart, talented, and capable? \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re his woman.\u201d</p><p>Way better than her answer, she thought, steps faltering. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember when you told me he vomits after drinking blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince I told you a few minutes ago, yeah, I think I recall a little bit of that conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch a pain,\u201d Noelle tsked. \u201cAnyway. Earlier, you also mentioned that he\u2019d had a little of your blood and was able to keep it down. You know, when he sucked on your tongue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. So.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo. Hold your applause until the end of my speech. Like I said, you\u2019re his woman. He won\u2019t be able to drink from anyone but you without ... what? Vomiting.\u201d An expectant pause. \u201cYou may clap now.\u201d</p><p>Was it bad that she wanted to? \u201cHis woman? No way.\u201d And yet, the words pleased her on an elemental, primal level. The thought of McKell only being able to sink those teeth into her ... the thought of McKell needing her ... the thought of McKell enjoying her and only her ... yes, yes and yes. But ...</p><p>The plastic phone cracked a little more. No, no, and no, she thought next, panic suddenly infusing her bloodstream. If that were the case, he would never leave her alone. He would be around all the damn time. He would expect her to obey him, the superior bastard.</p><p>Vampires are better than humans, she inwardly mocked. As if! She was just as good as any vampire. She was worthy, damn it.</p><p>Besides, she\u2019d already decided not to become romantically entangled with McKell. Well, part of her had. If he were to drink from her every damn day, she wouldn\u2019t be able to keep her hands from roaming over that delicious-looking body. And if she couldn\u2019t keep her hands off his body, they would end up in bed.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t let that happen. No matter how much she wanted it.</p><p>Thank God he was such an ass. Every time he opened his beautiful mouth, resisting him physically got a little easier. Right? She couldn\u2019t remember. Just then, all she could recall was the intense desire she\u2019d experienced when he\u2019d kissed her and the powerful jealousy she\u2019d experienced when he\u2019d bitten that other woman.</p><p>\u201cSo why do you need McKell\u2019s time-stopping skills at the bar?\u201d she asked, returning to a less upsetting topic.</p><p>\u201cIf he can stop time, maybe he can reverse time. And if he can reverse time, we can pounce while the queen is here, distracted and talking to Dallas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if he reverses time, won\u2019t that affect you? I mean, you still wouldn\u2019t know the queen was there.\u201d And how would it affect Ava? Would a time reversal wipe away the memory of McKell\u2019s kiss?</p><p>\u201cWell, stopping time doesn\u2019t affect McKell. Maybe reversing it won\u2019t affect him, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice deflection, but you didn\u2019t answer my question. What if the reversal affects you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Noelle replied on a sigh. \u201cMaybe it won\u2019t. Maybe he can reverse time for select individuals, allowing those of his choosing to remain unaffected like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of maybes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cActually, that\u2019s two maybes. Just ask him if he can do it, will ya?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask, but he\u2019ll refuse to help.\u201d Hopefully. Ava\u2019s step faltered a second time. She wanted McKell to refuse her? Just to retain the memory of his lips pressed against hers? How selfish was she? \u201cHe\u2019s not happy with me at the moment.\u201d</p><p>Noelle moaned. \u201cWhat\u2019d you do this time?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat makes you think I did something? I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEarlier you said you hurt him. What\u2019d you do, Ava?\u201d</p><p>She had to say it, didn\u2019t she? \u201cI, uh, kind of tasered him.\u201d</p><p>Another moan sounded, then a sigh. \u201cOkay. This isn\u2019t completely hopeless. While he\u2019s writhing in agony, go buy him a sappy card. That always lets people know you\u2019re almost sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d McKell\u2019s butterscotch voice said.</p> <p>Ava yelped in surprise and nearly dropped the phone. She must have lost focus\u2014again\u2014because she realized he was now keeping pace beside her, as if nothing bad had transpired between them. He appeared fine. Pale, but fine.</p><p>Thank God. Relief speared her, stronger than any other emotion she\u2019d experienced that day.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there,\u201d she told Noelle, \u201cno matter what. As for him, he\u2019s not writhing, so there\u2019s no need for the card. But he may or may not be with me.\u201d She severed the connection before her friend could reply and pocketed the phone.</p><p>\u201cBe where?\u201d McKell asked.</p><p>\u201cA bar.\u201d She grabbed his wrist. Electric currents must have still raced underneath his skin, because the sizzle seeped into her. She turned him, so that they were heading in the other direction. His violet gaze remained locked on her, his lids at half-mast, his lips soft and ... ready?</p><p>Heat bloomed in her cheeks. Was he thinking about drinking from her? She waited for him to try, breathless. Even waited for him to try and take a swing at her for bringing him down like a mangy animal. He did neither. Unfortunately.</p> <p>Damn it. What was wrong with her, wanting him to make a play for her like that? Any play.</p><p>\u201cHim who?\u201d he demanded as they meandered down the street.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d she answered honestly.</p><p>The tension in his shoulders eased. Tension she hadn\u2019t noticed before. \u201cSo you weren\u2019t wanting the aid of another man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She could barely handle McKell.</p><p>\u201cThen I won\u2019t spank you.\u201d</p><p>McKell ... spanking her ... Someone get this man a paddle. \u201cGee. Thanks.\u201d Good. There\u2019d been no intrigue in her tone.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. So where are we going? A bar, you said?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d She pointed to a building across the street, even as she raced to the other side. He never fell behind, but he did grab her just before she hit the curb, jerking her to the right.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she demanded, surprised.</p><p>His expression was as tense as his body had been. \u201cI didn\u2019t want you walking into ... nothing. Just be more careful.\u201d</p><p>Walking into what? She glanced around, saw nothing out of the ordinary. Weird vampire.</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re going to Starbucks?\u201d he asked, giving her a little push forward. \u201cHow will a coffee help me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the only one who gets thirsty.\u201d She entered the building, and immediately cursed under her breath. Despite the late hour, there was a crowd. Was everyone in need of a pick-me-up?</p><p>She found a place at the end of the line, noting the way every female there watched McKell. Some stealthily, some with outright awe. Ava couldn\u2019t blame them, but she did resent them. He\u2019s mine, she wanted to shout. Which was absurd.</p><p>Had to be Noelle\u2019s proclamation. You\u2019re his woman. To his credit, he seemed completely oblivious to the sudden surge of estrogen and pheromones wafting his way.</p><p>\u201cSo. This bar,\u201d he said.</p><p>Ripples of feminine pleasure accompanied his low, purring timbre.</p><p>\u201cRight. The bar,\u201d she replied. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but hunting you-know-whats has to be put on hold.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows furrowed together, a slash of black against the creamy expanse of his skin. \u201cBecause I was a naughty boy?\u201d</p><p>McKell ... naughty ... She gulped, her blood heating dangerously. He\u2019d said that on purpose, the diabolical bastard. Now all she could think about was naked bodies straining together. As if you can blame him. You were thinking about that, anyway.</p><p>\u201cNo. Because I\u2019m an agent, and I have a job to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well. I\u2019ll go with you and help.\u201d</p><p>Exactly what Noelle had wanted. Exactly what Ava had told her friend wouldn\u2019t happen. Yet he\u2019d offered easily, without being asked, without whining.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sick.\u201d As she spoke, she watched him closely, gauging his reaction. His expression never changed. No fear, no upset. \u201cYou should be resting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never be too sick to protect you.\u201d Seductively uttered, as if they were discussing favorite sexual positions. Oh, yes. He was doing it on purpose, and she had every right to blame him. And punish him. With a severe tongue-lashing.</p><p>She tried to mask her shiver with a cough. \u201cI think I\u2019ve proven that I can take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. But even the best soldiers need backup upon occasion.\u201d</p><p>Even the best soldiers, he\u2019d said. Did he consider her a \u201cbest soldier?\u201d Did he respect her skill? The pleasure she took from that was immeasurable. \u201cYou\u2019d be willing to take a pyre-ray for me?\u201d she asked, serious. \u201cBecause I\u2019m heading into a den of vipers. Well, vipers to you. To me, they\u2019re colleagues. They might shoot you first and ask questions later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVipers smipers. And yes, I would absolutely take a pyre-ray for you.\u201d He was as serious as she had been, with no hint of sarcasm.</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d He had to be. But the pleasure she\u2019d considered immeasurable? Just exploded into thousands of tiny stars, the intense glow of them probably seeping out of her skin.</p><p>\u201cAbout your safety?\u201d He shook his head, a dark lock of hair falling over his brow. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened, even as she reached up and smoothed the hair back into place. Still the connection sizzled between them. \u201cBut ... why?\u201d</p><p>Before he could answer, they reached the front of the line, and she ordered. Her mouth watered as her butterscotch mocha was prepared. And when the steaming cup was finally placed in her hands, she sipped, moaned. This was a rare treat, but she\u2019d earned it. She hadn\u2019t slept with McKell.</p><p>They walked outside, the cool, clean air once again enveloping them, and McKell sniffed, face slowly turning in her direction. \u201cThat coffee smells like you,\u201d he muttered huskily. \u201cDelicious.\u201d</p><p>His voice was like a caress, hot and insistent, and her blood heated yet another degree. \u201cI just tasered you. Why are you being so nice to me?\u201d The moment she asked the question, the answer slapped her in the face. He\u2019d realized she was his, too. He wanted, needed her blood and would do anything, even treat her like a cherished princess, to get it.</p><p>What a bastard.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I realized the error of my ways,\u201d he said with a shrug.</p><p>She nearly snorted. There was no reason to let him know she knew about the vampire mating business, and a thousand reasons not to. Namely, power and manipulation. Still. She wanted to ask how things worked. Like, what would happen to him if she died? Like, could he sleep with anyone else, or would he want to rely on Ava for that, as well? Like, what would happen to him if she refused to feed him?</p><p>Would he ... die?</p><p>She pursed her lips, not liking that thought any more than she had earlier. And what if they were wrong? What if she wasn\u2019t his?</p><p>She\u2019d give him another taste, she decided, and test his reaction. If they were right, if she was his, she would keep him addicted and craving what only she could give him\u2014which in turn would keep him strong and (hopefully) malleable. And that was the one and only reason she was about to offer her vein.</p><p>Protesting too much?</p><p>Oh, shut up.</p><p>You\u2019re talking to yourself, you know.</p><p>Yes, and I believe I told you to shut up. She stepped into the next dark alley she encountered, since she knew he liked those, stopped, finished her mocha, licked the cup clean, cursed that there was no more, then held out her arm. \u201cYou may have a sip,\u201d she told him regally. \u201cBut only a sip. Okay, maybe a few gulps. But that\u2019s it. Any more than that, and you\u2019ll have to say good-bye to your balls.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her wrist, where her pulse thumped wildly, and then her eyes. \u201cWhy are you offering?\u201d he asked, clearly suspicious.</p><p>Time to lie her ass off. Except, the words emerged on a surprising sigh of truth. \u201cWe\u2019re headed into a nest of AIR agents, like I told you, and I need you at your best. You seemed to handle my blood earlier, so I figured you could keep a little more down. Plus, you were being nice and that deserves a reward.\u201d</p><p>Positive reinforcement. If she pretended to reward him for being nice, he would continue to be nice. And as an added benefit, the bite would hurt and she would stop craving it. Stop wanting to tear other women away from him.</p><p>His fingers wrapped around her wrist, gentle and warm, still sizzling. Finally, he was touching her again. She licked her lips; she just couldn\u2019t help herself. But he didn\u2019t swoop down and bite. Not yet. He stood there for several heartbeats of time, the wait making her ache. Eager.</p><p>\u201cWhy are we going into a nest of AIR vipers?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cScared? I understand.\u201d Negative reinforcement would work, too, she supposed, then frowned. What? Did she now want him to go with her? You\u2019ll protect him. Take a pyre-ray for him just as he claimed he\u2019d do for you. Better that than splitting up. No telling when he\u2019d return.</p><p>His nostrils flared as he inhaled sharply. \u201cI\u2019m scared of nothing. I\u2019m merely curious.\u201d</p><p>She tried not to smile. So easily manipulated, her vampire. She\u2019d just assured he would go with her, no matter what. Now, he had to prove himself.</p><p>His gaze cut at her, the violet hard as an amethyst. \u201cYou suddenly smell of smugness. Which means you were baiting me, you tricky hussy.\u201d His thumb traced a figure eight over her wrist, even while he pulled her closer, the jewel-rigidity in his eyes softening. His warm, minty breath trekked over her face. \u201cBut I don\u2019t mind. I like it. Now. Why are we going into a nest of AIR vipers? You have yet to explain.\u201d</p><p>Resistance faded. Fighting would have accomplished nothing, the ache inside her too strong. Once again she forgot everything but the vampire in front of her. What they could be doing, what they would soon do.</p><p>\u201cAva,\u201d he entreated.</p><p>Focus, think. He\u2019d asked a question. \u201cThere\u2019s an alien queen who wants to destroy Earth,\u201d she said. \u201cShe appeared in a bar a few blocks from here, and now all the patrons are being interrogated and I\u2019m gonna help with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, then.\u201d Finally, he lifted her wrist. His tongue emerged and licked over her skin, leaving a sheen of wet and more of that heat. \u201cI\u2019ll help, too. After.\u201d Still he didn\u2019t bite. Just hovered, waiting.</p><p>Every second that passed was more excruciating than the last, intensifying the ache. \u201cJust do it.\u201d She\u2019d meant to snap at him\u2014anything was better than this torturous anticipation\u2014but the words were breathless, all her need shining through.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll learn, female, that it\u2019s best not to rush this.\u201d Slowly, so agonizingly slow, his fangs sank into her skin.</p><p>Oh, sweet heaven. Not once did she feel pain. His teeth must have produced a numbing drug, because all she felt was the erotic glide of his tongue, the intoxicating suction of his mouth. And now that he\u2019d bitten her, the ache should have vanished. Only, the ache spread, becoming a far worse traitor to her common sense.</p><p>She\u2019d wanted this, demanded it even. A mistake. A mistake she would pay for for the rest of her life.</p><p>Her knees weakened, and her bones liquefied, sending her deeper and deeper into his body until she was using him as her sole means of support. He allowed the connection, but didn\u2019t take advantage. She wanted him to take advantage. Her nipples pearled and moisture wet her panties, both reducing her to a creature of sensation. A creature whose only purpose was achieving climax. She was shameless, willing to do anything.</p><p>If only he would nibble a path to her neck. If only he would spread her legs with his knee, rub his erection against her core, then spin her, press her against the brick, rub her harder, faster, creating a dizzying friction, then strip her, penetrate her, claim her.</p><p>She would force him if necessary. Yes. Yes. She would trace her hand along his chest, feel the bump of his scar, wonder how he\u2019d gotten it, run her fingers along the waist of his pants, feel the tip of his erection, the bead of pre-come, and\u2014</p><p>With a groan, he disengaged from her, severing all contact and moving out of touching range.</p><p>Her arm fell heavily to her side as she panted, fighting past the haze of longing to concentrate on him. \u201cWh\u2014what\u2019s wrong?\u201d What she really wanted to say: Give me more.</p><p>\u201cHad a ... few gulps ... already.\u201d At least he was panting, too. That meant he was equally affected. Right? \u201cPromised. No more.\u201d</p><p>Anger sparked. Why hadn\u2019t he ignored her demand? Why hadn\u2019t he tried something sexual? Had he not liked her taste? Had he\u2014</p><p>No, no, no. Ava cut through those thick threads of anger, snapping them apart, allowing other, saner emotions a path to travel. She couldn\u2019t think like that. She\u2019d wanted him, yes. More than she should have. But there\u2019d been a purpose to this experiment, one she couldn\u2019t forget. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d she asked, having to utilize every cell in her body for strength. Only problem was, those cells still craved McKell and urged her to lean toward him.</p><p>\u201cFine. I feel fine.\u201d In that moment, utter hostility radiated from him.</p><p>Why, she didn\u2019t know. Her gaze raked him. His color was high, his lips puffy and stained red. A bead of blood trickled from the corner of his mouth, and he quickly licked it away, closed his eyes, savored. The sight of his tongue ... get yourself under control. He wasn\u2019t shaking, but his muscles were clearly knotted, stiff.</p> <p>She waited. He didn\u2019t hunch over, and he didn\u2019t vomit. That could only mean one thing. According to vampire lore, she was his. Truly his. Any lingering disappointment and anger drained from her completely.</p><p>She was his, she thought with a grin, and there was nothing he could do about it.</p><p>Ten</p><p>Ava was his, McKell thought with a frown, and there was nothing he could do about it. Yet. There was no denying it now, either, not in any way. Not while the proof settled so sweetly in his stomach, strengthening him, burning him so magnificently, reshaping him into something far more lethal than he\u2019d been. Her protector.</p><p>Damn, damn, damn. Because pairings were all about body chemistries and hormones, he could blame no one but himself. Well, and Ava. But why would his own body pair him with a human? He was offended, insulted, and ... sated.</p> <p>The first mouthful of Ava\u2019s delightful blood had been heaven. The second, hell. He\u2019d wanted more, all, every drop. Wanted her in every way imaginable. Stopping had been painful, but that need to protect ... Ingrained.</p><p>His strength had improved with every swallow. His senses, too. His gaze could now cut through the dark as if sunlight followed him; every inhalation cataloged the scents around him, his brain instantly sorting them out and revealing exactly where\u2014and who\u2014they came from. The perfume of Ava\u2019s skin\u2014the orchids he\u2019d discovered their first night together, a coconut milk he hadn\u2019t, and that hint of sugar. Dirt, paint\u2014new and old\u2014coffee, syrup, even aged, unwashed urine at the side of the building. He could feel his body healing completely, flesh weaving back together, stitches popping out.</p><p>All wonderful, except now, without pain and weakness and hunger clouding his reactions, his shaft was hard as a rock. He wanted to strip his woman, throw her down, and sink deep inside her, thrusting, consuming, branding. And she wanted it, too. Need still pulsed from her.</p><p>He imagined those soft fingertips gliding over the slit in his penis, spreading moisture, gripping him, sliding up and down, wringing an orgasm from his very soul.</p><p>You were only supposed to seduce her into sharing her blood\u2014not allow her to seduce you.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said, slapping her hands together in a job well done. \u201cNow that we\u2019ve taken care of that ... let\u2019s roll.\u201d</p> <p>How unaffected she suddenly sounded. He fought a wave of anger. Earlier, he\u2019d saved her from walking into one of those glimmering doorways. Did she know? Did she thank him? No. Now he\u2019d saved her from being ravished by a vampire in public. Still no thanks was forthcoming.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t wish to discuss your feelings for me first?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed, the thickness of her lashes shielding the brilliant amber of her irises. \u201cMy feelings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I just drank your blood, and you enjoyed it. Were even aroused by it.\u201d He sniffed the air, the delicious air that enveloped her, savoring the lingering scent of her desire. \u201cSurely you wish to tell me how you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Scowling, she whipped out the small taser and held it out for his view. \u201cWe do not discuss feelings. Ever. Not even the ones you obviously have for me. Understand?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t within her reach, but he jumped backward, anyway. Too well did he recall how those volts had incapacitated him. \u201cFine,\u201d he snapped. What was wrong with her? Females loved discussing their feelings, analyzing everything, and discovering how much of his time he planned to give them.</p><p>He might have been waiting for Bride all these decades, but he hadn\u2019t waited alone. He\u2019d taken lovers. Many lovers. Nothing serious, nothing long-term, and certainly no one human. Each of his partners had had one thing in common. That silly urge to discuss everything. From what he was feeling at the moment to what he expected himself to feel in a few years.</p><p>Why didn\u2019t Ava?</p> <p>She holstered the weapon and walked away, saying, \u201cFollow or not. Get hit by a bus or not. Whatever. I don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>As if she truly meant what she said, she continued down the sidewalk without ever looking back. Why, that little ... that ... female! McKell gritted his teeth and chased after her, shouldering humans out of the way. No one dared confront him about his bulldozing tactics. Perhaps they realized how close to the edge of lethal he was.</p><p>\u201cYou must not realize the great favor I\u2019ve bestowed upon you,\u201d he said when he reached her side. Once there, he watched for one of those doorways, certain another wouldn\u2019t appear tonight but unwilling to lower his guard. \u201cYou are my food-slave.\u201d She was much more than that, but he would never admit it aloud. \u201cYet I treat you as an equal.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze flicked up to him, amber fury glowing within. \u201cThe favor you have bestowed upon me? And did you just call me a food-slave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes to both. Time and time again, you have hurt me, yet I have never retaliated. I only give you pleasure.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t face him again, just increased the speed of her stride. \u201cPleasure? Ha! You are such an egomaniac.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re deluded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExpectant bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUngrateful harpy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPig.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>The names they\u2019d shouted at each other echoed through his mind, and he blinked in shock. He\u2019d just slighted his woman. Twice. And he wasn\u2019t sorry. He actually felt ... better. Calmer. How odd. A vampire female would have broken down and cried, had he said those things, and he would have wallowed in guilt. Perhaps even have been executed by the king for the disturbance to their world. Ava merely hurtled another insult at him. And yet not once had there been hate woven into her tone.</p><p>Yesterday, hell, an hour ago, he hadn\u2019t understood how Ava and Noelle could call each other names yet still claim to love one another. Now, though, the truth was so clear. They had simply been expressing their discontent. And it was nice. To never have to hold back for fear of hurting someone\u2019s feelings, something he\u2019d always had to do with his vampire lovers.... It was freeing.</p><p>Because vampires lived in a small, underground world, escape rarely an option, peace was essential. Hurting feelings could lead to discord, discord to war, war to total elimination of the people. Therefore, his every word had been measured. Speaking his mind, the truth, had never been an option. When execution had been the most likely result, burying his emotions had seemed prudent. He simply hadn\u2019t realized the weight that kind of existence had pressed upon his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he told Ava, unable to mask his awe.</p><p>Her steps slowed, and he received another flick of her gaze, minus the anger \u201cThank you? Is this a trick?\u201d She frowned, slowed even more. \u201cWait. Don\u2019t answer that. Just ... put your game face on.\u201d</p><p>Game face?</p><p>They stopped in front of a red brick building with two guards posted at the entrance. Both were men, and both were holding pyre-guns. AIR agents, no question.</p><p>Ah. The bar. Now he understood.</p><p>He could smell every weapon in the vicinity. The soot on the barrel of the guns, the metallic twang of blades, the bloodstains on the tips of throwing stars, a piece of sharpened wood, poison, the sour motes emitted by grenades. For a moment, he wondered if this was some sort of trap to imprison him so that Mia Snow could finally speak with him. Kill him.</p><p>Ava was tricky enough to plan something like that, but why would she need to? he wondered next. He\u2019d fallen asleep in her home. She could have cornered him then. Could have removed his heart, even, and he would have been defenseless.</p><p>He schooled his features, revealing no hint of his emotions. Not that he knew what he was feeling at the moment. \u201cGame face on,\u201d he said.</p><p>Ava pointed a finger into his chest, her brown eyes suddenly unreadable. Or ... dare he hope he saw concern in those sensual depths? \u201cBehave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will if you will.\u201d</p><p>She squared her shoulders and faced the guards, flashing her trainee badge. \u201cI was called in,\u201d she said, \u201cand he\u2019s with me.\u201d</p><p>They moved aside, allowing her to pass. McKell followed her, the men watching him through narrowed eyes. Did they know who he was? Probably. They reeked of anger and hints of fear.</p><p>Just to be on the safe side, he stopped time for them, not releasing them until he stepped through a set of double doors. The bar was small but well lit, with a concrete floor painted to look like grass and gravel, and walls painted to look like a haunted forest. The many tables and chairs littering the area looked as if they were comprised of real wood, but they smelled like metal.</p><p>Civilians had been ushered into the far corner, guards watching their every move and ensuring they remained docile. In contrast, agents bustled in every direction, taking samples from the pool tables, running tiny, beeping machines over the walls. He recognized a few of those agents, and made sure to stroke his necklace when they glanced his way. A pointed reminder of the consequences of messing with him.</p><p>Each had the same reaction. The bleaching of skin, the increase in heart rate, and the profusion of sweat. Excellent. Finally, reactions he expected.</p><p>Someone he didn\u2019t recognize muttered, \u201cVampire,\u201d and then the word spread like wildfire, echoing all around him. Soon, those who possessed all ten of their fingers stopped what they were doing and stared over at him, unaware of the danger they courted. A few even withdrew their guns.</p><p>Just as he geared up to stop time, and perhaps slap them around while no one could see him, Ava stepped in front of him and spread her arms, acting as his shield. \u201cHe\u2019s come in peace,\u201d she announced.</p><p>At first, the thought that she wished to protect him delighted him, even though he should be offended that she doubted his ability, his skill. She might not want to discuss her feelings, but this proved she did have them. Why else would she place herself in danger to keep him safe?</p><p>But then, the thought that she had placed herself in danger had him wishing for a hacksaw. No one placed his woman in danger. Even the woman herself.</p><p>McKell pushed her behind him, blocking her from view.</p><p>\u201cWe need him for the investigation,\u201d she finished, moving to his side.</p><p>With those words, any lingering delight evaporated like mist. She hadn\u2019t shielded him because of her feelings, as he\u2019d supposed, hoped, but for her precious investigation. Yes, a hacksaw would be nice. Still. He tried to push her behind him again. She resisted.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to brag,\u201d Noelle said, disrupting the terse quiet. She had been hidden in the shadows of a far corner, and now strode to the bar, lifted one of the overflowing shot glasses resting on a tray, and tossed back the contents. \u201cBut my friend just did what no one else could. She brought in the wicked vampire of the far south.\u201d</p><p>The wicked vampire. He liked that.</p><p>\u201cI could have done it, too,\u201d someone muttered.</p><p>Ava stiffened.</p><p>\u201cWho said that?\u201d he snapped. How dare anyone question her skill!</p><p>No one stepped forward.</p><p>Ava relaxed, so McKell tried to force himself to do the same. The urge to kill continued to simmer, unwilling to be bottled. As he well knew, there was one thing guaranteed to put him in a better mood. \u201cYou should kiss your friend hello,\u201d he whispered to Ava. \u201cIt\u2019s the polite thing to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe only kissed to distract you,\u201d she whispered back.</p><p>\u201cNever, ever say that again. You enjoyed it. I know you did, and I\u2019ll not be convinced otherwise.\u201d</p><p>Her lips twitched.</p><p>And there it was. The one thing guaranteed to calm him. Her amusement. Helped that those lips were lush and pink, and if he leaned down just a bit, he could lick them.</p><p>Now isn\u2019t the time. He hadn\u2019t forgiven her for her casual disregard, he reminded himself.</p><p>A dark-haired woman stepped from the crowd of agents, her expression no-nonsense, her eyes a cold metallic blue. She was short, slim, young, and had the delicate face of a dancer. Mia Snow. At long last. He\u2019d caught a glimpse of her once before, when her team raided the underground vampire caves and McKell escaped captivity, along with Devyn Targon.</p><p>Captivity. How he loathed the reminder, especially in a roomful of his enemy, for memories suddenly swamped him, holding him as surely as the iron bars had. He could hear the drip of water, slow, insistent, smell the dew on the crystals knifing from the ceiling, and feel the walls closing in on him. He hadn\u2019t been fed, so hunger had gnawed at him, weakness eating at him.</p><p>Years ago, he\u2019d been ordered to kill Bride. As powerful as she was, the royal family had feared her. And they\u2019d had every right. Every vampire possessed a supernatural ability, but Bride, well, she possessed all abilities. There was nothing she couldn\u2019t do. Which was why her kind were considered dangerous; which was why her kind, the nefreti, were slaughtered the moment they were identified. Always. But he\u2019d loved her, or thought he had, and so, rather than remove her head, he\u2019d sent her to this surface world. Anything to save her.</p><p>He\u2019d had her memory erased, then branded his name into her wrist, meaning to find her one day, return her to their world, and finally wed her. He would have given her a new identity, of course, and no one would have known what she was, who she\u2019d been. Only, his plan had failed. He\u2019d returned her to the underground world, and the vampire king at last learned of his treachery, sentencing him to eternity in the dungeons. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He should have thanked Mia for aiding his escape, but at the time, he\u2019d been pissed at her refusal to let him near Bride. Because, like Bride, she had sided with Devyn, and McKell had wanted only to punish them. So he\u2019d ignored Mia and every single one of her summonses. Now, he felt no animosity toward her. Shocking.</p><p>\u201cI ask you to come see me, and you snub me.\u201d A glaring Mia stopped a few inches away from him. She smelled of the ice that was crystallized in her eyes. \u201cI send a few people to escort you, and you hurt them. Maim then. Now you have the nerve to show up at a crime scene and\u2014\u201d</p><p>McKell held up one hand, silencing her. \u201cShall I leave, then?\u201d</p> <p>She popped her jaw. \u201cSans, escort McKell to headquarters. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he might be able to help us,\u201d Ava said, and then launched into a speech about the merits of reversing time. \u201cI thought Noelle told you about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually ...\u201d Noelle joined their circle, hands stuffed in her jean pockets. \u201cI thought Ava and I could break the idea to you together. You know, in a calm, this-is-for-the-best discussion.\u201d</p><p>Ava moaned. Mia cursed.</p><p>While they continued their \u201cdiscussion,\u201d McKell inhaled deeply, looking for a distraction from the memories still shrouding him. He tensed. There was something familiar spicing the air ... something he\u2019d once adored. He finished his survey of the bar, and could only shake his head against another onslaught of shock.</p> <p>Think of the devil, and she would appear. Sitting on one of the pool tables were Bride and her husband, Devyn. They were focused on each other, and talking about\u2014McKell\u2019s ears perked\u2014Bride\u2019s desire for a bubble bath.</p><p>He waited for his chest to tighten as it always did when he saw them together, but ... it never did. Actually, he didn\u2019t react at all.</p><p>He recalled the day he\u2019d raised his sword to take her head, as ordered. Recalled the way those emerald eyes had looked up at him, filled with trust and love. Recalled how he\u2019d placed her well-being before his own.</p><p>If his plan had worked, they would be wedded now, with a child to spoil.</p><p>Would he still have craved Ava if he\u2019d been wedded to Bride? Vampire spouses drank from each other, and\u2014as he had proven today\u2014sickened when they drank from someone else. Even someone human. At the moment, he couldn\u2019t imagine not wanting Ava, even with a devoted Bride at his side.</p><p>Bride\u2019s scent didn\u2019t heat his blood. Her body didn\u2019t make his hands itch for contact. The thought of her with Devyn didn\u2019t send him into a killing rage. And what the hell was that strange man in the corner doing, eye-fucking Ava with an intensity that staggered?</p> <p>McKell flashed his fangs, but the man didn\u2019t notice. He was too focused on Ava, mentally stripping her. Kill, McKell would kill him.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d Ava suddenly demanded.</p><p>At first, McKell didn\u2019t realize she\u2019d spoken to him. Then she grabbed his arms and shook him, clueing him in. \u201cThat man.\u201d He pointed, flashed his fangs again. \u201cWho is he?\u201d</p><p>Ava followed the line of his finger and blushed. Blushed. Why? If she returned the eye-fuck ... \u201cUh, that\u2019s Johnny Deschanel. Just ignore him. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is he to you?\u201d McKell snarled.</p><p>\u201cNo one.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t believe her, and his claws were elongating, sharpening.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to allow you to help us, McKell,\u201d Mia said before he could storm over, slash, slice, destroy. Ava had never blushed before, and her denial had been too rushed. \u201cThe Sch\u00f6n are dangerous and unpredictable, and I need every man I can get. Especially someone with an ability like yours.\u201d</p> <p>Hack. Saw. \u201cHow magnanimous of you,\u201d he muttered, gaze remaining on Johnny. He wouldn\u2019t doubt if this was what Mia had planned all along. Pretend to want to incarcerate him, then offer him his freedom in exchange for his aid.</p><p>\u201cAfterward,\u201d Mia continued, \u201cI\u2019ll expect you to go to AIR headquarters and answer a few questions for me.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. What would pain this Johnny the most? Limb removal? Or watching his own guts spill from his stomach? \u201cI will do so, but only after Ava helps me with something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Mia\u2019s red-hot astonishment lashed him.</p><p>Had she never been denied? \u201cI apologize if I gave you the impression that the answer was any of your business.\u201d See me, Johnny. Fear me.</p><p>Ava and Mia gasped in unison. Noelle chuckled.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He\u2019d apologized, hadn\u2019t he?</p><p>Johnny straightened and smoothed the wrinkles from his shirt. McKell once again stepped forward, but Ava tightened her grip on his arm. Would have taken only a single tug to free himself, but that would dissuade her from touching him again, and he didn\u2019t want to dissuade her.</p><p>If you won\u2019t see me, see this, he projected at the man as he wound his arm around Ava\u2019s waist. She. Is. Mine.</p><p>Mia recovered quickly. \u201cFine. Don\u2019t tell me what you have planned. Ava and I can discuss it later. Meanwhile, if you hurt one agent, just one, I won\u2019t hesitate to slice your throat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happens if I hurt two?\u201d Another man approached Johnny, slapped him on the shoulder, and then he, too, focused on Ava as if he had every right. So. Two would die this night.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fucking hurt anyone,\u201d Mia shouted.</p><p>Temper, temper. Seriously. He\u2019d been nothing but polite. \u201cVery well,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I should warn you, I\u2019m not an easy person to slice. People tend to lose fingers when they try.\u201d See. Polite. He hadn\u2019t threatened her as she\u2019d done to him. He\u2019d merely stated a fact. \u201cNow, if you want to save your agents from my wrath, tell those two to mentally zip their fucking pants.\u201d</p><p>Johnny finally noticed him. McKell flicked his tongue over his fangs. A warning. A promise. The agent paled.</p><p>\u201cMcKell,\u201d Ava said, exasperated. And, if he wasn\u2019t mistaken, just a little happy. She hadn\u2019t once protested about his arm being around her, either. Sweet progress</p><p>You can concentrate on your woman now. He looked down. A mistake. Ava stepped away from him, and he mourned the loss of her heat.</p><p>\u201cWill you please pay attention,\u201d she muttered. \u201cYou\u2019re causing a scene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he is.\u201d Mia glared at her. \u201cHe\u2019s your responsibility, you know.\u201d</p><p>She sighed as if the weight of the world had been placed on her shoulders. \u201cYeah. I do know.\u201d</p><p>A grin. \u201cI always knew you were a smart one, Sans, so I probably don\u2019t even need to say this next part, but good job,\u201d Mia said with an approving nod. \u201cYou did the impossible. I\u2019m impressed.\u201d</p><p>Ava\u2019s chin lifted, pride filling her eyes. \u201cThank\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, dumbass! I didn\u2019t give you permission to test anyone\u2019s blood,\u201d Mia shouted to another agent, already pounding toward the dumbass in question, Ava forgotten. That didn\u2019t lessen Ava\u2019s reaction. So much pride ... still growing ...</p><p>So. She responded well to praise. He made a mental note to praise her. Often. Only until he was done with her, of course, and he had everything he wanted from her. But oh, he liked that look on her. And anyway, she had deserved the praise. She was the most resilient person in the bar. She backed down from nothing, even her boss.</p><p>Noelle propped her hands on her hips and regarded Ava intently. \u201cDid you ask him about the time-reversal thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d Ava massaged the back of her neck. \u201cHe\u2019s in a bad mood.\u201d</p><p>He loved when they discussed him as if he weren\u2019t in the room; he really did. \u201cYou expected me to reverse time? Sorry, but I\u2019ve never had the ability.\u201d He\u2019d tried. Many times. Always he\u2019d failed. \u201cNow, Noelle. I have a question for you. Ava, you are not to answer for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. You can\u2019t reverse time?\u201d Noelle asked with a pout. \u201cNot even a little?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Now. Who is that man to Ava?\u201d He pointed to Johnny, who was wiping the lint from his shirtsleeve.</p><p>\u201cThere goes my genius plan,\u201d Noelle said, disappointed, but she followed the line of his finger and scowled. \u201cOh, him. He\u2019s a bad memory.\u201d</p><p>Ava groaned. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe slept with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He hadn\u2019t meant to shout, but the volume of his voice had been uncontrollable in the light of Noelle\u2019s confession. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few months ago,\u201d Ava whispered, another blush in full bloom. \u201cIt was a mistake.\u201d</p><p>Death and pain weren\u2019t good enough for the bastard. Only total ruination would suffice. McKell would ensure the man suffered eternally. No one touched Ava, his woman, without his permission. Ever. Even months ago. When he hadn\u2019t even known her. Irrational, but his sense of possession was so great, time offered no kind of barrier. And if Ava protested his logic, well, he would give her permission to ruin the life of every woman he had ever slept with.</p><p>Johnny must have realized they were discussing him in a negative way, because he glanced up, scowled. Then he made another fatal mistake. He clapped his hands, demanding attention, and said, \u201cLook, everyone. Ava brought in the big, bad vampire. I wonder how she convinced him to ... come.\u201d</p><p>Several agents snickered.</p><p>No, total ruination wasn\u2019t good enough.</p><p>\u201cMcKell,\u201d Ava began, suspecting his intensions. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust.\u201d With only a thought, McKell stopped the clock. As everyone froze around him, unaware of what he was doing, he stomped to the puny human, punched him in the face, heard cartilage snap, and returned to Ava\u2019s side. He wished he could freeze time for a longer period of time and inflict more damage, but he couldn\u2019t. When he tried, he only weakened himself. A bar filed with AIR agents was not the place to weaken himself.</p><p>Soon, though, he\u2019d get Johnny alone. Nothing would stop his wrath then.</p><p>The clock restarted, and he watched as Johnny grimaced and rubbed his now bleeding nose, having no idea what had caused the break. And were those ... tears in the agent\u2019s eyes? McKell sharpened his study, grinned. They were.</p><p>He nearly beat his chest in satisfaction. I caused that.</p><p>Why had Ava willingly stripped for such a bastard? Why had she allowed him to tease and taste her?</p><p>A growl rose from McKell\u2019s stomach and churned in his throat. He stopped the clock again, closed the distance, punched the man again, cracking jawbone this time, and once again returned to an unsuspecting Ava. And this time, when he restarted the clock, the bastard dropped to his knees, moaning in pain.</p><p>\u201cMcKell,\u201d Ava muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked innocently.</p><p>Her lips twitched, surprising him, before she turned her attention to Noelle. \u201cSo what have you learned so far?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one remembers seeing the Sch\u00f6n queen, but that man\u2014\u201d She pointed to a very pale human male, who was hunched over in his chair and clutching his middle. Three guards pointed guns at his head. \u201cHe\u2019s already exhibiting signs of the disease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy hasn\u2019t he been quarantined, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not stunnable, and everyone who approaches him, he tries to bite. And as you know, biohazard suits don\u2019t stop the disease from spreading, so our clothing certainly won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Ava was in danger, McKell realized, and that he wouldn\u2019t tolerate. \u201cAllow me to take care of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMcKell, wait\u2014\u201d</p><p>For the third time that evening, he manipulated time. He approached the diseased man and slammed his head into the tabletop in front of him. When McKell restarted the clock, the man remained unconscious, slumped over the metal surface. \u201cNow you can cart him wherever you want.\u201d</p><p>Ava spun, clearly confused by his seemingly instant change in location. \u201cYou have to stop doing that! And don\u2019t you dare touch him,\u201d she said, rushing to his side to tug him away. \u201cHe might be bleeding.\u201d</p><p>McKell performed a quick scan of the tabletop. \u201cNo droplets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God.\u201d She shuddered with the force of her relief. \u201cContact with infected bodily secretions is what spreads the disease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetween humans, perhaps.\u201d Human illnesses never affected him. Still. He allowed her to usher him the rest of the way without protest. \u201cYou aren\u2019t to go near him again. No matter what. Understand?\u201d</p><p>Ignoring him, she instructed the guards to carry the man out of the building and into a cell at AIR headquarters. She proceeded to ignore McKell for the next hour, in fact, helping Mia, talking to the other humans. When one of the females\u2014one who reeked of guilt\u2014refused to answer her questions, Ava glanced around to ensure no one watched her, before pressing a blade to the woman\u2019s thigh.</p><p>The woman began babbling, spilling details about stealing money from the register. Not helpful, but that explained the guilt. Guilt Ava had sensed, even with her inferior human senses.</p><p>She was a competent soldier, he thought. If she couldn\u2019t get what she wanted the conventional way, she found another way. He liked that. He liked her.</p><p>Do not soften. Any more than he already had. If he did, she would constantly lead him around by his ever-randy swim team, as he\u2019d heard Devyn Targon say once.</p><p>A few times, lucky-to-be-alive Johnny Deschanel tried to edge to Ava\u2019s side. McKell always stopped time, punched him, then pushed him to the other side of the bar. Finally, the guy caught on and gave up. Soon after that, Mia Snow called it a night and told the agents to go home. They\u2019d sort through the acquired evidence tomorrow.</p><p>Ava approached McKell rather than Noelle, and he found that he liked that, too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She looked him up and down. \u201cYou good?\u201d Still concerned for his health?</p><p>\u201cYes. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Tired, though.\u201d</p> <p>Tired meant bedtime. Once again he wrapped his arm around her waist, ready to usher her from the building. \u201cLearn anything?\u201d he asked, scanning the area, ensuring no one would be following them.</p><p>\u201cOnly that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me later,\u201d he interrupted. \u201cI have to go.\u201d Johnny had just exited with that other agent. Tragically, bedtime would have to wait. First, he had a reckoning to ensure.</p><p>\u201cYou have to go?\u201d Ava called. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater.\u201d McKell raced after his prey.</p> <p>Eleven</p><p>Thanks to Ava\u2019s delicious, life-altering blood\u2014mmm, Ava\u2019s blood. McKell almost turned around, almost returned to her. Vengeance first. Determined, he continued following Johnny. And thanks to Ava\u2019s blood\u2014mmm\u2014he had no trouble tracking the agent through the darkness.</p><p>He would drain the bastard. Cut off his fingers, one at a time, then his toes, one at a time. He would peel flesh from bone, slice into muscle, remove limbs, organs. Death would always remain a short distance away.</p><p>And Ava, who is responsible for you, will pay.</p><p>His steps faltered. If Johnny was hurt in any way, everyone would know McKell was responsible. Ava might lose her beloved job. And if she lost her job, she would hate him. He didn\u2019t want her hate.</p><p>He needed her devotion.</p> <p>In a blink, the reckoning morphed into a recon mission. He would learn everything he could about Johnny. Then, tomorrow, he would prove how much better he was. Simple. Easy.</p><p>Disappointing.</p><p>For Ava, he would persevere.</p><p>Currently, Johnny was with the other agent who liked to stare at Ava. Jeremy was his name, and his scent was similar to Johnny\u2019s. Perhaps they were brothers. They kept pace beside each other, unaware of the vampire stalking their every move and listening to their every word.</p><p>\u201cYou gotta leave that girl alone,\u201d Jeremy said.</p><p>Ah. He was the smart one.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my twin, bro. Not my probation officer. I don\u2019t have to do anything.\u201d</p><p>Yes. Brothers.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe you didn\u2019t notice the rabid vampire eyeing you like man-corn all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed,\u201d was the grumbled reply. Johnny rubbed his nose, his swollen jaw. \u201cI think he sucker-punched me, like, ten times.\u201d</p><p>They snaked a corner, the sidewalk free. Not many people were out now. Most were at home, snuggled in their beds. As McKell would soon be. With Ava. His delicious Ava.</p><p>\u201cNo way. I never saw him go near you,\u201d Jeremy said.</p><p>\u201cHe can control time or some shit like that. Believe me, he approached.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you shouldn\u2019t have watched Ava like that.\u201d</p><p>Smart? Jeremy was a genius.</p><p>\u201cShe wants me,\u201d Johnny said with enough fire to torch an entire village. \u201cShe\u2019s just playing hard-to-get.\u201d</p><p>Once again McKell\u2019s nails elongated, sharpened. Surely Ava wouldn\u2019t be blamed for a little scratch on the man\u2019s trachea.</p><p>\u201cAre you fucking kidding me? She slept with you, then ignored you afterward. That isn\u2019t playing hard-to-get. That\u2019s playing he\u2019s-bad-in-bed-and-I-want-nothing-to-do-with-him.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m amazing in bed, McKell thought smugly, nails retracting a bit. Once she sampled him, Ava would never want to leave him.</p><p>\u201cFuck you, Jeremy. You can\u2019t even pay a girl to get in bed with you.\u201d</p><p>There was no hate or malice to the claim; Johnny spoke as if he were simply stating a fact both men knew and accepted. McKell pictured the agent in question. Unlike Johnny, Jeremy had thick black brows and a too-long nose. His eyes were black, like bottomless pits. Those eyes weren\u2019t evil, though. They were kind, concerned, yet hardened by life.</p><p>Still. Not an attractive face, but he was bigger than Johnny. Taller, more muscled. Jeremy would have been the better choice for any female. So why hadn\u2019t Ava chosen him? Because she appreciated beauty?</p><p>McKell didn\u2019t like the thought, even though he himself was beautiful. The boast wasn\u2019t egotistical of him. Like Johnny, he was simply stating a fact. A fact he\u2019d been told his entire life. Still, he thought again. He would have preferred Ava to look beyond the surface. Beauty faded. Not his, of course, because he didn\u2019t age, but hers would. She would age.</p><p>He frowned. He didn\u2019t like the thought of her withering, then dying, either.</p><p>You\u2019re going to tire of her eventually.</p><p>Would he, though? His desire for her seemed to grow with every moment that passed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an asshole,\u201d Jeremy said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t relish the thought of finding pieces of you all over New Chicago. So do me a favor and stay away from her. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re acting like I have no skill. I could take him.\u201d</p><p>McKell barely managed to silence his snort. And just how did the human plan to \u201ctake him\u201d? With his puny pyre-gun? He should ask the other AIR agents how that had worked out for them.</p><p>\u201cJust ... watch your mouth, too,\u201d Jeremy said. \u201cOkay? Please. You keep badmouthing Ava, and you won\u2019t have to worry about the vampire. She\u2019ll end you herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever, dude. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>The two men branched apart, heading in opposite directions. McKell continued to follow Johnny. The agent plowed ahead, lighting a cigarette along the way. Cigarettes had been outlawed years ago.</p><p>Dark smoke plumed around him, and the few citizens who were out and about frowned and waved their hands in front of their faces. One even dialed the police to lodge a complaint.</p><p>Maybe I can help with that. If Johnny were to light himself on fire with one of his cigarettes ... well, there would be no puncture wounds or claw marks to incriminate McKell.</p><p>He smiled for the first time since leaving the bar.</p><p>A woman stepped in front of Johnny, and the agent ground to a quick halt. \u201cOut of my ... way,\u201d he said, tone changing midway. From angry to intrigued.</p><p>McKell stopped, too, and studied her from the shadows. She wore all white, a dress that flowed around her like water, had short black hair and a sweet, humanoid face most men probably drooled over. But she wasn\u2019t human. She couldn\u2019t be. The smell of rot wafted from her, strong enough to cause bile to rise in his throat.</p><p>Exactly what she was, he couldn\u2019t tell. The clothes fit the description Dallas had given of the Sch\u00f6n queen, but the hair didn\u2019t. Supposedly, the queen had long blond hair. Could she change her appearance, perhaps? He wouldn\u2019t have thought so, but that smell ... more than rot, it was undiluted disease. Disease in its purest form. Grotesque. Yet she appeared healthy, completely unaffected. Another characteristic of the queen.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said in a voice that was more song than anything, humming against his eardrums.</p><p>Dallas had mentioned nothing about her voice. Not that McKell had overheard, anyway.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Johnny replied in what he probably considered a sexy purr.</p><p>There were three men behind the woman, and they were cloaked by shadows of their own. McKell could see them, though. They wore all black, were as tall and muscled as he was, and watched the woman with impassive expressions. They were armed. He sniffed. With pyre-guns set to blazing. Protecting her?</p><p>Johnny didn\u2019t seem to notice them. He remained relaxed, on the prowl. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be out this late. The streets are dangerous. Especially for stunners like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m lost,\u201d she said, twirling a strand of her hair.</p><p>A lie. McKell could smell that, too.</p><p>Beside her, a doorway of air opened. Bright, those dust motes like outstretching arms. Come, McKell thought he heard inside his head, the voice male, soft, and directed at him. As every time before, no one else seemed to notice. Not even the woman, with her deceptively shrewd gaze. Please.</p><p>Silently McKell backed up a step. He\u2019d always suspected, but now he knew. The doorway was sentient. And clearly chasing him.</p><p>Dangerous, that voice said. Be careful. Please be careful.</p><p>Here to protect him? Or to at last trick him, sweeping him to his damnation?</p><p>A similar doorway had brought the vampires from their home to this one, thousands of years ago. Though it hadn\u2019t spoken. He\u2019d even heard gossip that a similar doorway had opened for his mother, had stolen her, then returned her months later. She\u2019d never spoken of what had happened during her absence, but she had cried herself to sleep for a long time afterward. So, he could guess. She\u2019d been damned.</p><p>Go, he mentally shouted at the door.</p><p>The air shimmered, wavering, then faded. He hadn\u2019t expected obedience.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019re you headed?\u201d Johnny asked. \u201cMaybe I can help you find your way.\u201d</p><p>With one threat thankfully gone, McKell focused on the other. How charming the soon-to-be agent was. Was that how he\u2019d won Ava? McKell could be charming, too. When he wanted to be.</p><p>\u201cWell ... to be honest, I don\u2019t actually have any place to go,\u201d the woman said with a sweet smile, her charm far greater than Johnny\u2019s, but no less fake.</p><p>\u201cI could take you to my apartment, I guess. If you wanted. You could ... call someone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I would like that.\u201d</p><p>Before they could wander off, McKell stopped time. Approached. He removed the weapons from the men, tossed them in the Dumpster behind them, and memorized their faces in case he ever ran into them again. He also patted down the woman. She didn\u2019t have a weapon, but this close, he could see past her ... skin? Perhaps. It was as if she\u2019d cloaked herself in a beautiful, radiant mask, shielding the world from the hideous monster that lurked beneath. Pitted flesh, oozing sores, missing teeth, hair frizzed and matted. Inhuman.</p><p>The queen. Had to be.</p><p>From what he\u2019d heard, she was treacherous, destructive, vile in a way only the soulless could be. AIR was desperate to stop her, but Johnny deserved what she would do to him. What McKell couldn\u2019t do to him. What McKell wanted to do to him.</p><p>But as cold and unfeeling as McKell was, probably as soulless as the bitch in front of him, he couldn\u2019t allow it to happen. Because of Ava. Letting her coworker suffer this way could very well bring the disease to her doorstep.</p><p>So. The lucky bastard had been saved. Again. Scowling, McKell returned to the shadows and freed the group from his time-stop, unable to hold them any longer.</p><p>They kicked back into gear, unaware of what had happened. The guards wouldn\u2019t even suspect they\u2019d encountered a foe until they reached for their guns. He didn\u2019t follow, allowing the distance to grow between them. Only when they were out of hearing range did he withdraw Ava\u2019s phone, scroll through the address book, and find Mia\u2019s number.</p><p>The head of AIR answered on the second ring, barking a command for him to speak. He did, telling her what he\u2019d discovered, what he thought, and where the group was headed. She cursed as if she were being tortured, told him to return to Ava and stay put, then hung up on him.</p><p>He pocketed the phone, certain he deserved some type of reward for his actions this night. He\u2019d saved an enemy, after all. For Ava.</p><p>His lips curled into a smile. Since he\u2019d done the saving for Ava, she would have to supply the reward. McKell knew exactly what he wanted ...</p><p>Where the hell had McKell gone?</p><p>Ava remained in the bar, drinking with Noelle despite her fatigue and sulking about his disappearing act for half an hour before asking her friend to drive her home. She didn\u2019t have a car of her own\u2014they were too expensive\u2014and she didn\u2019t want to walk.</p><p>Noelle was far more intoxicated than Ava, but the good news was, there was no such thing as drunk driving. Not anymore. Cars drove themselves. All humans, otherworlders, and bastard vampires had to do was punch in the address of the destination, and bingo. Done. All that remained was the time spent on the road.</p><p>\u201cTwo things I gotta tell ya,\u201d Noelle said as the brand-new vehicle wound through the streets. Rich as she was, she\u2019d had the bright red sports car delivered the day after McKell destroyed her sedan. And yes, her words were slurred.</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d Ava\u2019s were, too, for that matter.</p><p>\u201cFirst, I\u2019m sorry I called you fat the other day.\u201d Noelle was the world\u2019s nicest drunk. After a few shots, she always regretted everything she\u2019d done and said for the past\u2014however long had passed since her last drink. \u201cYou looked gorgeous, but I was feeling bitchy because I\u2019d called dibs on McKell but he only had eyes for you.\u201d</p><p>She tried not to grin, she really did. \u201cHe did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. And it was fucking depressing. I\u2019m pretty, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe prettiest.\u201d</p><p>Noelle fluffed her hair. \u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the second thing you wanted to tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, you gotta tell me how you do it.\u201d</p><p>The car hit a bump, and her stomach lurched. She leaned against her seat and peered up at the open ceiling panel. Stars winked in the sky, blurred together, danced, and caught her mind up in the twirl. \u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet men to follow you around like little puppies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d Proof: Where the hell was McKell?</p><p>\u201cDo. Johnny Deschanel still wants you. Jeremy Deschanel would like a go at you, too. And McKell would follow you into hell\u2014and did!\u2014but nobody wants me.\u201d Pouting now.</p><p>Ava closed her eyes and turned her head in Noelle\u2019s direction. Only when the spinning stopped did she allow her lids to open. \u201cEveryone wants you. Well, not McKell. You\u2019re right about him.\u201d He\u2019s mine! \u201cBut did you see how fast he flew out of the bar? He couldn\u2019t get away from me fast enough.\u201d Now she was pouting. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, that. I know what happened.\u201d Noelle waved a dismissive hand through the air, then frowned as she wiggled her fingers. \u201cHe\u2014Oh, no. No, no, no. I have seven fingers. How did I get two extra?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can get them surgically removed.\u201d God, she was smart. \u201cNow, what were you saying about McKell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d Noelle tapped a nail against her chin, brightened. \u201cOh, yeah. He followed Johnny. Probably to kill him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d She couldn\u2019t help it. She grinned again. She\u2019d imagined three likely scenarios for his departure. One, meeting a food-slave-slash-lover. Two, needing space. From Ava. And three, meeting a food-slave-slash-lover.</p><p>She frowned. Her math might be a little off. Oh, well. \u201cA man defending my honor. How cool is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive bucks says McKell cuts off Johnny\u2019s penis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen says he\u2019ll remove the man\u2019s heart.\u201d A girl could hope, anyway.</p><p>Sleeping with Johnny was one of the stupidest things she\u2019d ever done. But she\u2019d been feeling lonely, had drunk just a little too much, and well, she\u2019d thought she was crawling into bed with his brother, Jeremy. He was stacked, just like she preferred. Just like McKell.</p> <p>McKell. Her McKell.</p><p>Yeah, muscles were still her weakness.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never drinking again,\u201d she said, then lifted the bottle of Jack she\u2019d brought with her and drained the rest of the contents.</p><p>\u201cMe, either.\u201d Noelle confiscated the bottle, realized there was nothing left, and licked the rim. \u201cDallas was looking pretty hot, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d To be honest, Ava had only been able to see McKell. That dark hair, those violet eyes. The way he kept stopping time to punch Johnny in the nose. What a hero.</p><p>\u201cSo was Hector. Looking hot, I mean. But he\u2019s pretty much a bastard, so I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll go for it.\u201d</p> <p>Hector was muscled, and before McKell, Ava had actually sized him up and called dibs. Not that she\u2019d ever done anything about it. \u201cHe\u2019s yours, if you want him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConcentrating on McKell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He\u2019s not a potential lover.\u201d Except that he is.</p><p>\u201cWhy? He\u2019s off the must-kill list. I mean, Mia wouldn\u2019t have let him stay in the bar if he was still on it. So he\u2019s no longer your enemy. He\u2019s your helpmate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelpmate? Do you hear how ridiculous you sound? But think about it. If I sleep with him, I\u2019ll no longer be regarded as a competent agent. I\u2019ll just be the girl who has to sleep with men to get them to cooperate. You heard Johnny, right? \u2018How\u2019d she get the vampire to come?\u2019\u201d she mocked.</p><p>The car stopped at an intersection. Built-in sensors also knew when to slow down, when to speed up, and when to halt abruptly if something unexpected flew in the way.</p><p>Noelle pressed a few buttons, forcing the car to move forward despite the red light. That option was not something all cars possessed. \u201cAlls I\u2019m saying is that you\u2019re too worried about what other people think of you. You always have been. McKell likes you, and you like him. Go for it. Everyone else can go nuck themselves. Wait. Is that the right word?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t refute Noelle\u2019s claim. She was worried about what other people thought; she hated herself for it, but couldn\u2019t change how she felt. Too many years of being called \u201ctrash\u201d had left her raw and scarred inside. Even though she often professed to be unaffected. Even to herself.</p> <p>Alcohol brought out the honesty in her, she supposed.</p><p>\u201cAnd Ava? News flash. The vampire slept at your place and came with you to a job. People already think you\u2019re sleeping with him.\u201d</p><p>She scrubbed both hands down her face. Without her arms holding her steady against the seat, she banged into the window when the car turned. \u201cOuch.\u201d Frowning, she rubbed her now-stinging temple. \u201cNo one knows he slept at my place but you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I can keep a juicy bit of gossip like that to myself.\u201d</p><p>Ava rolled her eyes, then moaned. Mistake! Another wave of dizziness slammed her, caused her stomach to do the lurching thing. \u201cYou\u2019d never tell. You love me too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! That brings me to the second thing I wanted to discuss with you.\u201d</p><p>The car slowed and angled toward the curb on their right. Ava saw her building. Run-down, with peeling paint and soot-stained glass for windows, rather than the shield-armor higher-end apartments used.</p><p>\u201cTell me before I go upstairs and puke my guts out,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cMy mom\u2019s decided to host a\u201d\u2014Noelle gagged\u2014\u201ccocktail party. You have to come.\u201d</p><p>Ava was shaking her head\u2014and moaning again\u2014before the last word had left her friend\u2019s mouth. \u201cNo. Your mom hates me, and I hate her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. I can\u2019t do it without you, and I have to do it.\u201d</p><p>Please. The plea singed her ears. As if she could say no now. Noelle never begged. \u201cFine. But you\u2019ll owe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can start by doing your own laundry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no.\u201d Noelle shook her head, then moaned louder than Ava had. \u201cAnything but that.\u201d</p><p>Someone tall and wonderfully roped with sinew and muscle unfolded from the shadows of the building, stepping into the light seeping from the streetlamps, revealing black hair and glowing purple eyes, and snagging Ava\u2019s undivided attention. McKell, she realized, heart suddenly careening.</p><p>He was here.</p><p>He scowled and crossed his arms over his chest.</p><p>Darling caveman. \u201cI\u2019m afraid the laundry is nonnegotiable. Oh, and we\u2019ll discuss the rest of your new duties tomorrow.\u201d If she remembered this conversation. \u201cOpen,\u201d she said to the door, and the block instantly obeyed.</p><p>\u201cDuties? As in more than one?\u201d Noelle screeched.</p><p>Ava emerged. \u201cClose,\u201d she said to the car, ignoring her friend. The door clicked shut, muffling any reply Noelle might have made. Gaze drilling into an obviously fuming McKell, she approached. And only fell once. Okay, twice.</p><p>When she reached him, he didn\u2019t kiss her hello as was proper. He sniffed the air, deepened his scowl, and hefted her over his shoulder fireman-style to carry her inside.</p><p>Twelve</p><p>Where\u2019d you go so fast earlier that you couldn\u2019t even kiss a girl good-bye?\u201d Ava asked McKell when he finally set her on her feet. Took a moment, but her head finally cleared, and she looked around without losing her dinner\u2014that entire bottle of Jack.</p><p>She was at her front door, she realized. Why that was a surprise, she didn\u2019t know. She\u2019d been outside her building just a few minutes ago, and McKell had carried her through the doors, up the elevator, and down the hall. Maybe. The night\u2019s events were beginning to blur together.</p><p>What she did know? The vampire owed her a kiss.</p><p>Kiss, kiss, kiss. Her mind kept snagging on that one word. That must mean she needed one. Desperately. Therefore, once she and McKell reached the privacy of her living room, she\u2019d take one.</p><p>Decided, she placed her hand on the ID box. Blue lights scanned her prints, and a few seconds later, her door unlocked, opened.</p><p>\u201cBefore I answer your question,\u201d McKell said, catching her by the waist and holding her in place, \u201cyou\u2019re going to program my ID into that thing, so that I can come and go as I please.\u201d</p><p>What an excellent idea. Then he could kiss her anytime she wanted.</p><p>She lifted his free hand\u2014no reason to disturb the warm, insistent arm still wrapped around her\u2014and pressed his fingers into the pad. After she entered the code, another blue light erupted, this one memorizing. A few seconds, that was all that was needed.</p><p>Eager to collect her prize, she turned to face him. \u201cNow ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d he asked, scowling as he lowered his arm.</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d</p><p>McKell released her and barreled past her. Without kissing her. \u201cWhere did you go after I took off?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Her disappointment finally managed to rally her common sense, reminding her of three things. She wasn\u2019t a slave to her hormones, he\u2019d promised her an answer but hadn\u2019t delivered, and he should not have waited outside for her, as if they were a couple and he had every right to do so.</p><p>Time to instruct him. She spun on her heel and followed him inside. \u201cI stayed at the bar.\u201d Oops. She hadn\u2019t meant to answer him.</p><p>\u201cDrinking,\u201d he snarled, sprawling on her couch. And he was holding the whip he\u2019d brought the first time he\u2019d come here, running the length through his fingers.</p><p>\u201cYou say that like it\u2019s a bad thing.\u201d She fell into the chair across from him and moaned. World ... spinning again ... And the stupid spinning caused her stomach to do that stupid churning thing.</p><p>\u201cToo much alcohol can kill humans, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t had too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you tell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had a lot more on many occasions and\u2014this next part might come as a shock, so brace yourself\u2014I\u2019m still alive.\u201d Maybe.</p><p>He was far from amused. \u201cYou should see how green you are. In fact, you\u2019re probably dying right now. And if you die, you will sorely upset my plans for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlans that involve kissing me?\u201d At the thought, her stomach settled. She licked her lips, eager to finally begin.</p><p>His nostrils flared and his pupils dilated, signs of arousal, surely, but all he said was, \u201cYou won\u2019t be able to hunt vampires.\u201d</p><p>Oh. You aren\u2019t disappointed. Because you aren\u2019t a slave to your hormones, remember? She closed her eyes and rubbed her temples. \u201cIs that why you\u2019re so pissy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not pissy,\u201d he gritted out. \u201cOnly females are pissy. But yes, we will soon kiss.\u201d</p><p>How superior he sounded. Something that had always irritated her in the past. And yet, it was delight whisking through her now, softening her. They woiuld soon kiss! \u201cSo where did you go earlier? You promised to answer me if I programmed your ID into my box, and I did.\u201d Tomorrow, she might regret doing that. Tonight, she only wanted to celebrate.</p><p>McKell propped his head against the back of the couch and peered up at the ceiling. \u201cIf you must know, I followed Agent Deschanel. Johnny, you probably like to call him. Or John. Or Love Bunny.\u201d</p><p>Noelle had been right. \u201cThree things, vampire. He\u2019s still in training, so he isn\u2019t technically an agent yet.\u201d There was no way she would let anyone, especially McKell, grant Johnny Deschanel a title he didn\u2019t yet deserve. \u201cNext, he isn\u2019t my Love Bunny. And finally, did you follow him because you were jealous of his association with me?\u201d Please, please, please.</p><p>McKell snorted. \u201cHardly. I followed him because he was a suspicious character.\u201d</p><p>Finally they were getting somewhere. She gripped the edge of the chair and leaned forward. \u201cSuspicious of wanting to get my clothes off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf foul play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFoul play with my body?\u201d</p><p>Now he leaned forward, blazing gaze locked on her. \u201cI wasn\u2019t jealous, damn you.\u201d</p><p>Liar. \u201cSo did you cut off his penis or cut out his heart?\u201d Fingers crossed he said heart. Noelle would owe her ten whole dollars, and she already knew what she would buy. Butterscotch-flavored lipgloss to replace the one McKell had stolen.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He shook his head in astonishment. \u201cNeither.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her shoulders sagged. So close to victory, yet so far away.</p><p>\u201cYou are ... disappointed by this? Because I can return to him and remove his penis, no problem.\u201d</p><p>At \u201creturn to him,\u201d hope had sprouted wings. At \u201cpenis,\u201d those wings had withered. Foiled again. Her shoulders sagged a little more. \u201cSo you would have gone for the penis? Because a man loves with his heart, and isn\u2019t loving a woman worse than boinking her?\u201d</p><p>Another shake of his head. \u201cYes, the penis, and no, loving isn\u2019t worse. Boinking is. But again, you sound disappointed.\u201d</p><p>McKell had just said \u201cboinking.\u201d She snickered. Then she remembered that she\u2019d just lost her bet with Noelle and wouldn\u2019t be getting that lipgloss. \u201cI am,\u201d she said on a sigh. \u201cThere goes ten hard-earned dollars.\u201d Sure, he hadn\u2019t actually performed a cock removal, but intent was just the same. \u201cAnd now that we\u2019ve got that settled, let\u2019s backtrack a bit. Do you want to hurt him because you were jealous of him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you. I wasn\u2019t\u2014I\u2019m not jealous. Of anyone!\u201d Pause, grumbling. \u201cBut I called dibs on you. Which means you belong to me. And he was looking at you. At my property.\u201d</p><p>Fight the urge to cheer. \u201cJealous, jealous, jealous,\u201d she tsked.</p><p>\u201cAm not!\u201d He snapped the middle of the whip taut, his knuckles white over the leather.</p><p>Maybe fight the urge to taunt him, too. \u201cI was with Johnny before I met you, so the dibs system doesn\u2019t really apply.\u201d</p><p>More grumbling, but she couldn\u2019t make out the words, only the frustration behind them. \u201cWhy were you with him, anyway? He\u2019s a sad excuse for a man. Even a human man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you must know, I thought I was with his brother Jeremy.\u201d She ignored the \u201ceven a human\u201d part, too busy trying to eradicate the growing heat in her cheeks.</p><p>First, renewed astonishment fell over McKell\u2019s face. Then, relief. Then, anger. She did a double take, certain she was misreading him. But, no. The anger was real.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you want to be with him?\u201d he demanded. \u201cI mean, I thought it would be better if you were uncaring about appearances. But damn it, this is worse.\u201d</p><p>Worse, how? \u201cHello. Did you see his muscles?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, mine are bigger.\u201d He gave another snap of that whip.</p><p>He spoke only the truth. His muscles were bigger, which meant, so was his sex appeal. And not just to Ava, strength aficionado. One glance from those wicked violet eyes, and a woman knew what she would be getting from him: pleasure in its purest form.</p><p>Hands, kneading. Legs, twining. Shaft, pumping. Nothing taboo. No inhibitions.</p> <p>Raw need curled through her.</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t he kissed her yet? He\u2019d promised to do so, right?</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t talk about this anymore,\u201d he said, tossing the whip aside and rubbing at his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m too close to storming out of here and decapitating both brothers.\u201d</p><p>Her desire faded. \u201cSo you think less of me?\u201d Like, say, trash. \u201cFor sleeping with someone before you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d The sudden sincerity in his tone relaxed her. \u201cYou\u2019re a woman with needs, and believe me, I\u2019m grateful for those needs. I simply cannot tolerate the thought of another man touching ...\u201d His jaw clenched. In and out he breathed, the air rasping, harsh. \u201cWe have to change the subject. Now.\u201d</p> <p>She understood. He didn\u2019t begrudge her past, just as she didn\u2019t begrudge his. But the thought of him with someone else, even before he\u2019d met her, was far from pleasant.</p><p>Which was odd, now that she thought about it. They hadn\u2019t slept together, and she\u2019d told herself\u2014several times\u2014that she wouldn\u2019t venture down that path with him. Yet she couldn\u2019t deny that every bone in her body screamed mine.</p><p>He was right. They needed to change the subject.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to talk about?\u201d she asked.</p><p>A moment passed. He shrugged, the action like a neon sign pointing to the wide width of his shoulders. \u201cI think I ran into the Sch\u00f6n queen.\u201d</p><p>So casually offered, with just a hint of expectation. She could only stare at him and try to process. \u201cOkay. Wait, wait, wait. What did you just say?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe had dark hair, but this woman was definitely diseased.\u201d He waited now, as if he expected something from her.</p><p>Yet again, his tone was so casual he could have been discussing the weather, rather than the case that could change the fate of the world. \u201cTell me everything.\u201d</p><p>He did, from the way the brunette had appeared out of nowhere, to her proposition to Johnny, to the exquisite mask she\u2019d worn, to the guards standing silently behind her the entire time.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you apprehend her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd risk carrying the disease to your door? No.\u201d</p><p>Argh! Ava dug out her cell phone and dialed Mia. The conversation was short but not very sweet, McKell leaning forward, watching her expression the entire time. His expectation had swelled. Maybe because Mia quickly informed her that McKell had already called and that she was taking care of things.</p><p>\u201cYou should have incapacitated her in some way,\u201d Ava growled as she dropped her phone on the table beside her. He was strong enough, wily enough. And damn it, his concern for Ava was panty-melting. \u201cAIR would have forgiven you for everything and stopped harassing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t harassing me now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine. I would have stopped harassing you.\u201d</p><p>His eyelids dipped to half-mast, and what remained of his emotions drained: anger, expectation, everything. Except desire. Desire that heated the entire room, crackling and charging. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to stop.\u201d</p><p>The hello and good-bye kisses she\u2019d so badly wanted, well, she was finally in danger of receiving them. She gulped, swallowing the lump trying to block her airway. \u201cThen I would have harassed you nonstop,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>His gaze moved to her lips. \u201cWould you have allowed me to feed from you? Whenever I wished?\u201d</p><p>No. \u201cYes.\u201d Maybe.</p><p>In a blink, he was on his feet. The desire drained, as well, and determination took its place. \u201cI\u2019ll hunt her down and apprehend her now.\u201d</p><p>Ava\u2019s desire vanished just as swiftly. So. He hadn\u2019t craved her. He\u2019d craved a never-ending happy meal. She should have known. Suspected, at the very least. \u201cYou\u2019re staying here,\u201d she said, standing, swaying. \u201cMia told me her orders. We\u2019re not to interfere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMia isn\u2019t my boss.\u201d He moved toward the door.</p><p>Scowling, Ava jumped in his path. \u201cShe\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>He halted just before contact and glared down at her. \u201cOut of my way, Ava.\u201d</p><p>As if he couldn\u2019t move her. \u201cYou had your chance. You blew it. So, like I said, you\u2019re staying here.\u201d Do not tremble. Do not show a single weakness.</p><p>Down, down he leaned, until his nose was level with hers. Still he didn\u2019t touch her. \u201cJust how are you going to stop me?\u201d</p><p>God, he smelled good. Her living, breathing butterscotch buffet. Focus. \u201cWe\u2019re partners, right?\u201d</p><p>He offered a reluctant nod, one that finally brushed skin against skin. There was no preventing her shiver then. The heat, the sizzle ... consuming.</p><p>\u201cWell, partners have to trust each other, and right now, neither of us trusts the other. Right?\u201d</p><p>Another nod, another brushing of their noses.</p><p>Another shiver from her. \u201cRather than getting me in trouble, we\u2019re going to spend the next few hours learning to trust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d One word, but like his whip nonetheless. Where was that thing, anyway? She could tie him down with it.</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s an exercise I\u2019ve seen people do.\u201d Good thinking. \u201cYou stand behind me, and I fall back. You catch me, and boom, I learn to rely on you and trust you to always protect me.\u201d</p><p>He arched a brow, clearly doubtful. \u201cLearning to trust is that easy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d A lie. She wouldn\u2019t trust him, not fully, no matter what\u2014he saw her as food, damn it!\u2014but the exercise seemed like a really good idea just then. Not just because they would be wasting time, distracting him, but because he would have to put his hands on her to catch her. And she really wanted his hands on her. Not for pleasure, but for inoculation.</p><p>She had to overcome this craving for him.</p><p>\u201cAnd while we\u2019re doing this,\u201d she said, squaring her shoulders, \u201cyou can tell me all about vampires. Everything I need to know to capture one.\u201d Tomorrow, she would fulfill her end of their bargain.</p><p>Several minutes ticked by in silence. He watched her every torturous second of those minutes, gaze hooded, yet still managing to wreck havoc on her nerve endings. They felt razored, sensitized.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he finally said, voice as devoid of emotion as his eyes. Eyes that fell to the hammering pulse at the base of her neck.</p><p>Thinking of drinking from her, even now? she wondered as she gave him her back. Dangerous on her part, perhaps, but she wasn\u2019t too worried about him swooping in for a taste of her. At the moment, he was too interested in gaining rights to her blood, and if he took a sip without permission, he\u2019d never gain those rights.</p><p>\u201cAre you just going to stand there?\u201d he asked, whisper-soft.</p><p>That whisper traveled the length of her spine, and she had to steel herself against another decadent shiver. \u201cTell me something about vampires first.\u201d While she prepared herself for what was to come.</p><p>Another pause. Then, \u201cEach vampires has a different ability.\u201d</p><p>Do it. Just do it. She allowed herself to fall backward. \u201cYours is manipulating time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He caught her just before she hit and held her there, suspended in the air.</p><p>She gazed up at him, his face upside down yet still beautiful, and licked her lips. His hands were as warm and strong as she\u2019d imagined. \u201cWhat are some other abilities?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeleporting.\u201d His voice was strained as he eased her to her feet. \u201cMind control. Camouflage. Vampires like Bride can do everything, though.\u201d</p><p>She prayed the strain wasn\u2019t from her weight. \u201cBride.\u201d The name echoed through her mind, and then she remembered. Bride, his former fianc\u00e9e. A spark of jealousy ignited. Did he still yearn for the lovely, dark-haired vampire? \u201cShe can do everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Everything,\u201d he replied, unaware of her sudden shift from nervous anticipation to fury. \u201cWell, except manipulate time. Now, is it your turn to catch me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Still mine. I\u2019m stuck on the word everything.\u201d Ice crystallized the words, making them as hard as diamonds. Again she fell back.</p><p>Again he caught her\u2014still warm, still strong, but even more so\u2014and held her suspended. The violet of his eyes snared her. \u201cAnything you can think of, she can do.\u201d The strain in his voice was even worse. \u201cWhat\u2019s hard to understand?\u201d</p><p>I am. I\u2019m heavy. Unlike lithe little Bride, who couldn\u2019t weigh more than a hundred and ten soaking wet and weighed down with rocks. \u201cJust shut up.\u201d</p><p>And wow. Bride was not only beautiful and sensually lean, she was beyond powerful. No wonder McKell had waited so long to marry her and no other.</p><p>Hello again, inferiority complex, Ava thought hotly.</p><p>McKell set her back on her feet. His fingers remained splayed over her ribs, hard but not bruising. \u201cMy turn now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ll tell you when. Until then, keep catching me.\u201d Each word ripped from her throat, leaving a raw, venom-burned wound. Why was he so eager for his turn, anyway? She was going to drop his ass flat. Like he deserved. \u201cWere you upset when Bride married Devyn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Bastard! \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you kill him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause killing him would have made her hate me.\u201d</p><p>And he wanted\u2014still wanted?\u2014Bride to love him? Depression replaced her anger. \u201cI don\u2019t like this game,\u201d she said. Really, she didn\u2019t like Bride. All-powerful Bride, she inwardly mocked. Possessive McKell had let someone he considered his go, rather than fight and cause hatred.</p><p>He flattened his hands on her shoulders and forced her to turn. Then he pressed, forcing her to stay. She peered up at him. Despite everything, she liked the sear of his palms, the tickle of his fingertips, and wanted them to dip, to explore.</p><p>\u201cAny more questions? Or may I have my turn now? A turn you will give me.\u201d</p><p>She definitely had another question. \u201cVampires feed on humans, right? And yet, once they\u2019re married, they can only feed on their spouse. So what happens when two vampires marry?\u201d</p><p>There was a sharp intake of his breath, a narrowing of his eyes. \u201cSo you know about vampire mating habits, do you?\u201d</p><p>Oops. She hadn\u2019t meant to alert him to that fact.</p><p>His gaze explored her face, searching for the answer she refused to give. He must have seen the truth, because he flicked his tongue over one of his fangs. \u201cVampire spouses only feed on each other.\u201d</p><p>Now that he knew that she knew, there was no reason to hold back. \u201cThen why don\u2019t all vampires feed on other vampires and leave humans alone?\u201d Uh-oh. Was her resentment showing?</p><p>His grip tightened. \u201cBecause feeding on each other will wed them, and most vampires do not wish to be wed. Ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause eternity is a long time to be together.\u201d</p><p>Eternity. A blessing and a curse, she supposed. A forever of pleasure, as well as pain. \u201cYou guys don\u2019t die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy natural causes? Rarely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen isn\u2019t your underground word getting crowded?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s difficult for vampires to procreate. More than that, I was a good exterminator.\u201d</p><p>Ava imagined a vampire kid running around her place and wasn\u2019t completely repulsed. Interesting. Usually she hated kids. They were too ... needy. And messy. And clingy. No way did she want to be responsible for the way someone else turned out, blamed for their failures and mistakes. But a little McKell with black hair and violet eyes ... was a shockingly sweet image.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had my blood,\u201d she said, head tilting to the side as she tried to work a few things out. \u201cAnd if I was to have yours, we\u2019d be married?\u201d</p><p>He gave a stiff nod. \u201cIf you\u2019re thinking about drinking from me without permission, be warned that I will remove your teeth with pliers and seal your mouth shut, so that you never have the opportunity to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me stop you there.\u201d Ava reached up and closed his mouth for him. \u201cI won\u2019t be drinking from you. Ever.\u201d</p><p>At first, he gave no reaction. Then he wrapped his finger around her wrist and squeezed, a fire suddenly smoldering in his eyes. \u201cMy blood tastes delicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t care. Your blood could be liquid gold, and I wouldn\u2019t want it. I\u2019m not getting married. Not to you, not to anyone.\u201d Drunk or sober, she was confident in that.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m a prize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I\u2019m a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike that helps your case,\u201d she said dryly. \u201cVampires suck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He released her and stepped back, increasing the distance between them, the fire sparking white-hot. \u201cWould you want to wed a human?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy definition, not marrying anyone means I wouldn\u2019t marry anyone, no matter their origins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you wish to remain alone?\u201d</p><p>Hadn\u2019t she just said that? \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Now the fire spread to his cheeks, painting twin pink circles there. \u201cWe\u2019ll see about that. And now, little human, it\u2019s my turn to fall. You had better catch me, or I will punish you.\u201d He spun, giving her his back.</p><p>\u201cMcKell, I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>Down ... down ... he tumbled, ignoring her protest. She reached out, to catch him or slap him, she wasn\u2019t sure. But she never made contact. One second she was standing up, floundering, the next she was flat on her back and McKell was looming over her, pinning her and grinning wickedly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t catch me,\u201d he said. \u201cI get to punish you.\u201d</p><p>Her mind reeled at the change, but her body didn\u2019t care about the impossibility, simply reacting. Nipples beading, back arching, legs spreading. \u201cYou stopped time and moved me, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProve it,\u201d he said, and then kissed her.</p> <p>Thirteen</p><p>Ava meant to fight him. Perhaps knee him in the balls, slug him, even stab him again. Only, he was feeding her kiss after delicious kiss, hello and good-bye wrapped in one drugging interlude, his tongue thrusting into her mouth, as warm and strong as his hands and far more insistent, and her resistance melted. Had she ever really possessed any?</p><p>She wound her arms around him, one hand sinking into his silky hair, the other cupping the back of his neck, holding him hostage, taking, giving. Demanding more. He was so big, so heavy, he should have crushed her, did crush her, but she found she didn\u2019t need air. She just needed him. His weight, his heat, his breath.</p><p>He\u2019d reduced her to a live wire. A wire that couldn\u2019t spark without contact. Her legs spread farther, and his lower body moved, resting between them, poised. The thick length of his shaft pressed against her core, teasing. He didn\u2019t move again, though. Didn\u2019t rub, even a little, creating friction, such delicious friction, and that was probably for the best.</p><p>Probably? Ha! But she was as grateful as she was disappointed and confused. Had he rubbed against her, she would have been tugging at his clothes, demanding fuller contact, desperate for climax. He had to know that. So why wasn\u2019t he moving? Why was he maintaining such a lingering pace?</p> <p>Did he not plan to take this to the next level? Did he simply wish to put her in her place? Remind her that he was in control, that she was merely a human who craved a man out of her league? That she was good for food, and nothing more? Earlier, his concern had been for her blood, not her passion.</p><p>The spark dulled. Chilled. Left her cold. She pulled from the kiss. \u201cDon\u2019t do that again,\u201d she rasped.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He kissed his way to her neck.</p><p>Despite herself, she angled her head for better contact. She wasn\u2019t sure if she wanted him to kiss her there or bite her. All she knew was that, if he did bite her, she would have to kill him. Sad but true. She couldn\u2019t allow him to break his word without consequences\u2014even if she would enjoy the breaking.</p><p>\u201cAva. Answer.\u201d</p><p>Oh, yeah. He\u2019d asked a question. What did she not want him to do? \u201cStop time and ... position me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you like how I positioned you.\u201d He licked.</p><p>She shivered. \u201cYeah, but I don\u2019t like being forced.\u201d Force me. Wait. What?</p><p>Rather than sink his teeth into her neck, he moved lower. Kissed her sternum as if she weren\u2019t wearing a T-shirt. \u201cI\u2019m not forcing you.\u201d</p><p>What was he planning to do? \u201cAre you purposely frustrating me, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m trying to relieve your frustration, and collect my reward.\u201d Lower still. He stopped and rested his chin on her pubic bone, looking up at her without any emotion. \u201cYou do want to reward me for helping AIR, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She gulped. \u201cJust ... promise me that you won\u2019t stop time for me again.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cI\u2019ll make no such promise. You use what weapons you have at your disposal, and I use what weapons I have.\u201d</p><p>Irrefutable.</p> <p>A few minutes passed, yet he never moved from his new position. Finally, she forced her gaze away from his beautiful face. His blank expression had never wavered, and she feared what her expression revealed. Longing. Need. More of that confusion.</p><p>She peered up at her ceiling, flat, white, but every second that ticked by caused her anticipation to intensify. When would he move? When he did move, what would he do? And why was she giving him this time? She should find the strength to stand and walk away. If he felt nothing, she didn\u2019t want to feel anything either.</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you running away from me?\u201d he asked, breaking the silence. \u201cI could do anything I wanted to you, and you wouldn\u2019t be able to stop me.\u201d</p><p>Promises, promises. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOthers are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, why aren\u2019t you running from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOthers are,\u201d she parroted.</p><p>He kissed the flare of her hip, soft, sweet. \u201cYour nipples are hard.\u201d</p><p>Way to change the subject, she thought, shivering. \u201cI know.\u201d No reason to deny the obvious.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen them, you know.\u201d His voice was drugging desire, melted and poured over her.</p><p>Do not moan. Do not arch. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I stripped you. The first night I met you.\u201d</p><p>Do not cup your breasts. \u201cYou left me in my bra and panties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I stripped you naked, then decided to return your undergarments to protect your modesty when you traveled home.\u201d</p><p>Do not ask him to demonstrate exactly how he stripped you. \u201cSo ... did you cop a feel?\u201d She nibbled on her bottom lip, gaze returning to him unbidden. Mistake. Or not.</p><p>No longer did he appear unaffected. The color had reignited in his cheeks, his eyes an inferno of the desire she\u2019d heard in his voice. This was more than hunger on his part. This was need. Why had he tried to hide it? The answer didn\u2019t matter, really. She reacted. Moan, yes. Arch, definitely. There was no stopping her now.</p><p>\u201cCop a feel?\u201d He blew on her belly, warm breath seeping past her shirt. \u201cAre you asking if I touched you?\u201d</p><p>A fever spread through her, pulling her skin taut. \u201cYes, that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m asking.\u201d And begging for.</p><p>\u201cNo. I didn\u2019t.\u201d Another breath wafted over her. \u201cBut I wanted to,\u201d he added on a moan of his own.</p><p>Pulling ... tauter and tauter ... \u201cSo you liked what you saw?\u201d Whispers, echoes of her need.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven though I\u2019m a lowly human?\u201d</p><p>A minute passed, then another. He never replied, and she was glad. She hadn\u2019t meant to voice the fear, or even acknowledge it, but it was there, buried deep, yet somehow never far from the surface. Right now, though, she didn\u2019t care. Couldn\u2019t. The here and now was for pleasure, only pleasure. Pleasure he wanted, too, no matter the other things that had passed between them.</p><p>He smoothed her T-shirt away from the waist of her jeans, revealing a patch of needy skin. His tongue dipped inside her navel, swirling, and the fever spread again, causing her veins to expand.</p><p>Another moan slipped from her.</p><p>\u201cSay the word, and I\u2019ll open your jeans and move lower.\u201d</p><p>Anything. \u201cWhat word?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>And have his tongue dip into her core, licking, sucking, tasting? Her body arcing into him, demanding more? Satisfaction leaving her utterly sated? Until the fever returned\u2014and it would return.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d A tiny voice of reason in the face of unequivocal temptation. Still. Stupid, stupid girl. But she couldn\u2019t regret her decision. Much. A kiss on the mouth could be written off. Heavy petting, too. But a kiss between the legs? No. That was sex.</p><p>He stiffened, lifted slightly. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>She almost grabbed his head, almost pressed him back against her stomach. She had an excuse for her resistance, she knew she did, she just had to remember what it was. An eternity ago, she\u2019d even told Noelle\u2014oh, yeah. It came to her in a rush. \u201cI just can\u2019t sleep with an AIR target.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m helping AIR.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d An uncaring statement meant for her, not him.</p><p>\u201cAnd besides, we wouldn\u2019t be sleeping.\u201d He darted back up, covering her body with his own. \u201cWe would be pleasuring.\u201d His weight shot the air from her lungs, and as she opened her mouth to breathe, he descended. No more hesitation. No more lingering.</p><p>His tongue plundered deep, destroying her reason. Their teeth scraped, and his hands slid underneath her, lifting her up, pressing her into his erection. Finally, rubbing. Hard. Perfect.</p><p>Another moan emerged. So good. Stupid clothes. She despised them. Wanted to rip them off. Almost ripped his off, as her fingers kneaded his back, traced the length of his spine.</p><p>The rasp of their exhalations crackled in the air. They continued to grind against each other, propelling her need to new, vehement heights. Soon she was groaning, gasping, biting at him. No blood, she thought. No blood. There was a reason, but again, she had to remember what it was.</p><p>He didn\u2019t seem to care what she did. He just fed her kiss after electrifying kiss, panting, sweating, groping. Unrelenting.</p><p>This was what she\u2019d wanted, what she\u2019d needed. And as always with this man, being with him was heaven and hell. She knew she should stop, but couldn\u2019t. Consequences were for tomorrow, pleasure for today. Right?</p><p>He lifted one of his hands and massaged her breast, fingers rolling against her hardened nipple. How she ached. How she craved. More, more, more.</p><p>You already told him no more, she thought, that small kernel of reason returning.</p><p>Stupid.</p><p>\u201cMcKell,\u201d she gasped out.</p><p>His grip tightened, as if he knew where she was headed and hoped to misdirect her. The ache increased\u2014and so did the pleasure. It had been a long time for her, but she wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d ever wanted a man this desperately. As if she couldn\u2019t survive another moment without his cock inside her. Maybe because he tasted like butterscotch. Maybe because he felt like the final piece to the puzzle she\u2019d been trying to finish for years.</p><p>All from a kiss.</p><p>That ... scared her.</p><p>Think. She had to think about this, rather than plunge headfirst into an abyss of complications.</p><p>Again, she pulled from the kiss. \u201cWhat do you hope to accomplish, kissing me?\u201d she managed to say. Hopefully, he would stop before they reached the point of no return. Because she still couldn\u2019t stop him. Physically she could have, maybe, but not mentally. Not emotionally. She had to have this.</p><p>He lifted his head, and she wanted to scream. His lips were swollen, pink, and wet. \u201cI told you. Pleasure. For us both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can get that anywhere.\u201d Liar! She wanted him, and only him. Loved what she\u2019d done to his lips. Loved that he looked well-kissed, aroused beyond measure, his features tense, desperate.</p><p>Fury flashed through those violet eyes, angels and demons dancing in the midst of the flames. \u201cYou will not touch another man, Ava.\u201d</p><p>Loved that he\u2019d said that. \u201cAnd if I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill him.\u201d Simply stated, proving the unbendable oath behind the words.</p><p>\u201cDo you plan to touch another woman?\u201d What was she doing? Why was she pushing him like this? And in this direction?</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>That was why. She\u2019d needed his assurance, and the relief that accompanied it. \u201cNot even a precious vampire female?\u201d Ah. The deeper reason. So clear now. The question of his superiority and her inferiority had never truly left the surface.</p><p>He ran his tongue over his too-sharp teeth. \u201cNot even.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t sound convinced or convincing, and that pissed her the hell off, wiping away her relief in one fatal sweep. So she was supposed to abstain, but he could do as he pleased? She raised her knee between their bodies and planted her foot on his stomach. One forceful kick, and he was flying backward.</p><p>He hit her couch with a grunt, but he didn\u2019t freeze time or launch at her, merely settled comfortably against the furniture and glared over at her.</p><p>Panting, she sat up, shoving the hair from her face.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that for?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cFor your being an ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>Her lips pressed together in a mutinous line. As if she would say it aloud. Again. \u201cYou were telling me about vampires. Why don\u2019t you finish telling me so we can get to work?\u201d</p><p>McKell peered over at Ava, confused by her, yet still so highly aroused he could have torn her home apart. She\u2019d tasted unbelievably sweet. Had been soft beneath his hands. Soft and curved and perfect. His hands itched to return to her. To learn more about her, to memorize her.</p><p>His back stung from where she\u2019d dug in her nails, beseeching him for more. More\u2014which was exactly what he wanted to give. He\u2019d almost ripped her jeans from her body and licked into her feminine core, even though she hadn\u2019t asked as he\u2019d instructed.</p><p>Had he done so, he might have died from the pleasure. Pleasure he\u2019d meant to give her, taking nothing in return, addicting her to his touch, his tongue, before convincing her to giving him total access to her vein.</p><p>Only, along the way, her blood had ceased to matter. Only her passion had concerned him. Then she\u2019d pushed him away. Why?</p><p>What had they discussed before her passion had faded? Her being with another man, he quickly recalled. His teeth gnashed together. The thought of her with someone else nearly sent him into a killing rage. Whether he liked it or not\u2014whether she liked it or not\u2014she belonged to him just then.</p><p>She\u2019d demanded assurance that he wouldn\u2019t stray, and he hoped that meant she wanted him all to herself. So he\u2019d given her that assurance\u2014even though he knew he would one day purge her from his system. He would have to, if he hoped to wed someone of his own race, as was proper. Someone who wouldn\u2019t wither and die, leaving him alone and suffering.</p><p>That assurance was more than he\u2019d ever given another. And he\u2019d meant it. While they were together, he wouldn\u2019t be with any one else. Which wasn\u2019t a requirement, damn it! He couldn\u2019t drink from anyone else, but as he\u2019d already considered, he could damn sure fuck a thousand others. But would he? The answer was still a solid no. Did she appreciate that, though? Again, one big, solid, fucking no. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIgnoring me?\u201d she said, her calmness scraping his already raw nerves.</p><p>\u201cNothing else to tell,\u201d he replied darkly. \u201cYou\u2019ll lure them to me, and I\u2019ll take over from there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if they attack me?\u201d</p> <p>The thought of that angered him far more than the thought of her with another man. Something that made absolutely no sense. He would prefer her with someone else, rather than drained of blood? If so, that would mean ... no, no, hell, no. He wasn\u2019t going there.</p><p>\u201cMcKell,\u201d she snapped. \u201cAn answer, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they attack you, kill them or I\u2019ll do it for you. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d His rage wouldn\u2019t be, though. If anyone attacked her, even his own kind, he would lose control of his sanity and allow his rage to consume him. He knew it, felt it. The world would suffer.</p><p>\u201cBut if they\u2019re dead, they can\u2019t teach you how to live here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they try to hurt you, I won\u2019t want to learn from them.\u201d Would only want their blood to flow in a crimson river, soaking the concrete.</p> <p>Some of the tension left her features. \u201cWhat\u2019s the best way to lure a vampire, then?\u201d</p><p>All she would have to do was walk into a room, he thought. Any bloodsucker who could resist that sweet scent was stronger than him\u2014and no one was stronger than him. \u201cWe\u2019ll dress you in plain clothes, make you look weak and shy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s attractive?\u201d</p><p>No. \u201cYes.\u201d He didn\u2019t want her in the scanty clothing his kind preferred humans to wear, making them more easily accessible. \u201cThey\u2019ll think you\u2019re easy pickings.\u201d Plus, as small and delicate as she appeared, no one would suspect her of lethal strength and violent urges.</p><p>His cock ached. All that strength, all those urges ... he\u2019d had them underneath him.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said with a nod, drifting that sweet scent his way and managing to intensify the ache. \u201cI can do that. But how will I recognize a vampire? I mean, unless your fangs are extended, you look human to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnyone who tries to lure you away, you will bring to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if they aren\u2019t vampire?\u201d</p><p>Then they would still deserve the beating he gave them for daring to try to lure his woman. Temporary woman. \u201cI\u2019ll know the moment I smell them, and will send them on their way.\u201d Broken and bloody.</p><p>\u201cSounds tedious and boring, and not to mention like shooting an enemy in the dark. Which means, if you need that translated, we\u2019ll be relying on luck.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI can think of no other way. If they scent me first, and they will if I\u2019m by your side, they\u2019ll leave. Whether they want to drink from you or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe you should walk into wherever you think they\u2019ll be, and I\u2019ll wait at the back door and grab the runners.\u201d</p><p>Smart, but such a plan placed her in too much danger. \u201cYou won\u2019t be able to stop a fleeing vampire on your own, Ava. Besides that, we couldn\u2019t be sure what exit they would take.\u201d</p><p>The corner of her lip curled. \u201cI stopped you, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p> <p>Ache ... intensifying again ... \u201cAnd I stopped you back. Only my caring nature saved you. Something the others might not possess.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cCaring nature. Please. By your own admission, you just wanted to strip me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the only thing I wanted to do,\u201d he muttered. Then, more clearly, \u201cYou won\u2019t know what the vampires are capable of, so you won\u2019t know what to fight against. You won\u2019t be able to stop more than one, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo pyre-guns can stop two vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if there are three?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cI\u2019ll freeze two, then fire at the third. And if that doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019ll fistfight him.\u201d</p><p>The woman had an answer for everything. \u201cAnd the fourth? Fifth? No, don\u2019t reply. We\u2019ll do things my way or not at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well, in that case, I pick not at all.\u201d</p><p>And he\u2019d found her smugness attractive? His teeth gnashed as they often did in her presence. \u201cThen I won\u2019t help AIR. With anything. Not with vampires. Not with the Sch\u00f6n disease. Not with the Sch\u00f6n queen. I won\u2019t answer Agent Snow\u2019s questions, either.\u201d</p><p>After only the slightest hesitation, she said, \u201cFine. Your way.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, he eased to his feet. \u201cThank you. We shall begin tomorrow. As for tonight, get some rest. You\u2019ll need it.\u201d He strode to the front door, and it opened automatically, allowing him a straight shot into the hallway.</p><p>\u201cHey. Where are you going?\u201d she called.</p><p>\u201cUntil tomorrow,\u201d he replied as the door closed. Tonight, he needed to have a serious heart-to-heart with himself, and allow his anger with her to fester. Falling for this woman wasn\u2019t acceptable. Being charmed by her every word\u2014despite his irritation with her\u2014was not acceptable, either.</p><p>Surely there was someone out there who was prettier, wittier, and nicer. Someone better suited to him and his needs. Someone with fangs. Tonight, during his heart-to-heart, he would search. Find a starting place for his and Ava\u2019s hunt.</p><p>Because, what she didn\u2019t know and what he would never tell her, what he\u2019d realized a short while ago, was that if he could find and question bloodsuckers who had learned to live in the daylight, he could also find her replacement.</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>Another sleepless night. Of course. Ava expected no different despite McKell\u2019s command to rest and her body\u2019s desire to obey him. She\u2019d wanted to call him about ... oh, a thousand times, and ask where he\u2019d gone, and what he was doing.</p><p>By nine the next morning, when she suspected he would be sleeping himself, Ava gave up trying to rest and finally caved to the impulse. He had her cell phone, and what better way to punish him for stealing it?</p><p>After three rings, he actually picked up. \u201cWhat?\u201d he barked.</p><p>He was alive, at least. Ignoring her raging headache, she relaxed into the mattress, the covers plumping around her. \u201cHow dare you answer my phone, you thieving bastard.\u201d The hangover added spice to her tone. \u201cHave you been answering all my calls?\u201d</p><p>Static sounded, and she imagined him rubbing the fatigue from his face. Such a human thing to do, so slumber sweet. The pain in her temples migrated to her chest. \u201cAva?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho else would be calling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour friend Noelle. She called all night long,\u201d he grumbled. \u201cAnd she never talks about anything of importance. I now know about her favorite shoes, what foods agree with her and what foods do not. That wasn\u2019t pleasant to hear about, by the way. Oh, yes. And I know she\u2019s considering chopping off her hair, and can\u2019t decide if she wants to sleep with Dallas or Hector.\u201d</p><p>I love that girl. \u201cWho\u2019d you vote for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou. I offered to be there, and give instruction as needed. You\u2019re very difficult to please, you know.\u201d</p><p>A chuckle and a moan mixed in her throat, emerging as a cough. One part of her wanted to continue down that path with him, knowing very well where it would end. Heavy breathing, dirty talk, wandering hands, and climax. The other part of her wasn\u2019t brain-damaged.</p><p>She rolled from bed, phone propped against her shoulder and bones creaking in protest. \u201cAnyone left any messages for me?\u201d she asked as she padded into the kitchen. Yawning, she filled the coffeepot with synthetic coffee beans and water. Most food was synthetic, most meat was from cloned animals, and even fruit was somehow a copy of the real deal.</p><p>Apparently, after the human-alien war, supplies had dwindled, and unapproved scientific methods had been the only chance for survival. Suddenly those methods had met with approval.</p><p>\u201cPeople left messages, yes,\u201d he said, but offered no more.</p><p>\u201cWell, what are they?\u201d Thankfully, the scent of caffeine soon filled the air, chasing away the last remnants of exhaustion and alcoholic excess.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. They were for you, so I ignored them. You\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>Bastard. The pot finished its nearly instant percolation, and she poured herself a cup of coffee, then added the last of her butterscotch creamer. Wait. The last? She held the dispenser to the light and shook. Sure enough. Not a single drop remained. Shit. She needed a moment of silence to mourn its loss.</p><p>\u201cAva?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a sec.\u201d I\u2019ll miss you, sweet creamer. She sighed. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m back. So, if you won\u2019t tell me about my messages, tell me what you did last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The sudden edge of menace in his voice increased her curiosity. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ll tell you what I plan to do for the rest of the day, though.\u201d The menace faded, gentling to ... desire? \u201cI\u2019ll be sleeping and thinking about you. What about you?\u201d</p><p>Thinking of her. She almost melted. Almost. Sadly, it was lesson time. And today\u2019s moral? Keep secrets and suffer. \u201cBetter question: Who will I be doing today? But the answer\u2019s the same. You\u2019ll never know,\u201d she said, and severed the connection. Let him stew on that.</p><p>She drained her coffee, showered, and dressed in the standard AIR attire. White button-up top, black slacks, and faux leather boots. She anchored her hair in a lumpy ponytail. With her curls, no style would ever be smooth.</p><p>Noelle picked her up fifteen minutes late. As usual. \u201cWe look ridiculous, wearing the same outfit like this,\u201d was the first thing her friend said as Ava slid into the passenger side of the vehicle.</p><p>\u201cRidiculous, but cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>The sun was already too bright and too warm, the streets crowded with humans and aliens driving to work. Most were harried, almost spastic, while a few were calm, concentrating. Ava hoped she appeared calm, even though she felt harried. Fact was, she couldn\u2019t stand being late for anything.</p><p>No matter how late they were, though, Noelle never looked harried. Today, she was as beautiful and elegant as always, even in that white button-up. And, to be honest, they should have looked like they were wearing matching outfits, but they didn\u2019t. Noelle\u2019s shirt was clearly made of expensive cotton\u2014real cotton\u2014and appeared so soft Ava was tempted to strip and rub all over it.</p><p>\u201cOh, and to apologize for my tardiness, I brought you a butterscotch latte.\u201d Noelle held out a plastic mug.</p><p>Salvation. Even though she\u2019d already had her morning coffee, she drank greedily.</p><p>As the car meandered to AIR headquarters, Noelle said, \u201cMcKell go back to your place last night? I know he left again because I called him. Repeatedly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, and thank you for that. But nope,\u201d she grumbled. \u201cHe didn\u2019t return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he playing hard-to-get?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. He\u2019s playing Irritate Ava.\u201d Why hadn\u2019t he told her what he\u2019d done after leaving her apartment? Had he slept with some random female, turned on as he\u2019d been, and didn\u2019t want her to know because he suspected Ava would never allow him to drink from her again? Well, she didn\u2019t care who he slept with. She\u2019d told him no. Had left him primed. But damn it to hell. He\u2019d promised not to see anyone else. Hadn\u2019t he?</p><p>Only thing she truly remembered about last night was the fact that he\u2019d kissed her and left her.</p><p>\u201cIrritate Ava is my favorite game,\u201d Noelle said. \u201cYou\u2019re so cute when you\u2019re mad.\u201d</p><p>If he had slept with someone else, she\u2019d slap him on the back in a job well done. Just like she\u2019d do for any male friend she had. Not that she had any male friends. Not that she wanted any male friends. Men were stupid, stupid, stupid, and controlled by their stupid dicks, and that bastard McKell was going to be stabbed in the back if he\u2019d slept with someone else. Ava would rip him into ribbons and tie those ribbons on every bedpost she could find. A symbolic gesture McKell wouldn\u2019t understand because he was stupid!</p><p>\u201cUh, Ava?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she shouted.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it. You are so not cute when you\u2019re mad. Your cheeks are bright red, you\u2019re panting and sweating and ripping my brand-new, pristine interior apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d The haze of red faded from her gaze\u2014until that moment, she hadn\u2019t even realized the red had appeared\u2014and she looked around. She was still inside Noelle\u2019s car, her nails were scraping over the leather seat, and she was gritting her teeth so forcefully, her jaw ached. \u201cSorry. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries. Swear.\u201d</p><p>One by one she picked her nails out of the seat.</p><p>A few minutes later, they reached AIR\u2019s main gate, a simple iron bar that stretched from one guard post to another. A few yards beyond, the landscape was flat and bare, boasting no trees or flowers that would allow anyone to hide. There, in the center, sat AIR.</p><p>On the outside, the building appeared to be nothing more than a two-story warehouse comprised of metal and dark red brick. In actuality, three other stories were hidden underground. Three that she knew of; there could have been more. There were cameras and weapons everywhere, camouflaged between the bricks.</p><p>Security was taken seriously here. Protestors\u2014alien advocates\u2014had once raided the old building, allowing a dangerous prisoner to escape.</p><p>After two ID scans, she and Noelle were allowed to park in the underground lot. Took another ID scan to be allowed to walk out of the lot and into the building, and then several fingerprint scans, even a retinal scan, and three badge verifications to hit the elevator.</p><p>\u201cI wonder what\u2019s on today\u2019s agenda,\u201d Noelle muttered as they strode down the long, plain hallway toward Mia\u2019s office. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t know.\u201d No matter what, Ava wouldn\u2019t allow herself to think about McKell for the rest of the day. He would consume her, and that was dangerous.</p><p>They stopped in front of Mia\u2019s door, and a grinning Noelle pressed the speaker button. \u201cNoelle Tramain and Ava Sans reporting for duty, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny,\u201d Mia\u2019s raspy voice said from the speaker. There was a pause, then a click, then the door slid open.</p> <p>Mia sat behind her desk, paperwork strewn around her. Her lips were compressed into a mulish line, and bruises formed half moons under her eyes. Most likely, her night had been as sleepless as Ava\u2019s.</p><p>Dallas occupied a chair across from the desk, his expression as grim and tense as Mia\u2019s. Unlike Mia, however, he radiated guilt. Why?</p><p>Ava and a now somber Noelle stepped inside, and the door closed behind them automatically. Ava suddenly felt ... caged.</p><p>\u201cWe found Johnny,\u201d Mia said, jumping headfirst into business. \u201cHe\u2019s infected.\u201d</p><p>Ava\u2019s jaw dropped as a denial surged up her throat. \u201cWith the Sch\u00f6n disease?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d Dallas asked grimly. His gaze skimmed over Noelle, lingering a bit longer than necessary, before skidding away. For some reason, his guilt seemed to intensify.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Noelle breathed.</p><p>\u201cYeah. That\u2019s exactly what he did. Fucked the queen.\u201d Mia pushed out a breath. \u201cNot one of her servants or lackeys or whatever they are, but the queen herself. So his infection has spread quickly, more quickly than any of the other victims. We gave him the last remaining supply of Bride\u2019s blood, and that slowed things down, though we don\u2019t think it\u2019s healed him completely.\u201d</p><p>Bile joined denial, but she swallowed them both. Now was not the time to allow either to overtake her. She had to stay strong, and she had to keep her wits. Poor Johnny. She harbored no ill feelings for him, well, no death wish, even though he was a tool for kissing and telling.</p><p>\u201cNo one here has been able to get any details out of him,\u201d Mia continued. \u201cBut you, Ava, once slept with him, so we thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccidentally,\u201d Noelle interrupted.</p> <p>Dallas\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, uh, accidentally slept with him,\u201d Ava explained, cheeks heating as they always did when this subject arose.</p><p>A delicate hand punched through the air. \u201cI don\u2019t care if you fell from a ladder and somehow landed on his dick. He has feelings for you, so you\u2019re going to talk to him.\u201d</p><p>Not for a second did she think about refusing. If there was anything she could to do help, anything at all, she was going to do it. \u201cWhat should I ask him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want details. What did she say to him? How did she fuck him? What position? Did they do anything afterward?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso, ask him if he\u2019s noticed any changes in his body, besides a hunger for human flesh,\u201d Dallas added.</p><p>Mia propped her elbows on her desk, pinning Ava with her ice-blue stare. \u201cIf you\u2019re scared, we can find someone else. Just say the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not scared,\u201d she growled. A lie. The thought of being in the same room as a person with a highly contagious disease terrified her. What if Johnny spit on her? What if he leapt at her and bit? Would she be infected, too? Would that stop her, though? No. \u201cI\u2019ll do it. Just tell me where is he, and it\u2019s done.\u201d</p> <p>Dallas nodded in satisfaction, gaze returning to Noelle before again skidding away, as if he didn\u2019t trust himself to prolong even so small a contact. \u201cI\u2019ll lead the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come. For moral support,\u201d Noelle said.</p><p>A muscle ticked below his eye, but he unfolded from the chair, tall and leanly muscled. A dark avenger. As he strode past Ava and Noelle\u2014both of them had to step to the side to provide a space for him to exit\u2014the door opened. Without missing a beat, he hit the hallway. Reminded her of McKell, when he\u2019d left her apartment. On a mission, determined.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t going to think about him. Or that. Not even to distract herself from the dangerous pool she was about to jump into.</p><p>She and Noelle followed Dallas, silent. Along the way, Noelle twined their fingers and squeezed in reassurance, offering comfort.</p><p>Thank you, she mouthed.</p><p>Noelle nodded, and looked away from Ava as quickly as Dallas had looked away from her. To hide her fear, Ava knew. She gave a squeeze of her own, letting her friend know all would be well. She kept the I hope to herself.</p><p>A few twists and turns, agents striding in the opposite direction, and they finally entered the interrogation wing of the building. So soon? she thought, panic suddenly beating hard fists in her lungs.</p><p>You can do this. You will do this.</p><p>Dallas stopped in front of an unmarked door, then motioned to the entrance next to it with a tilt of his chin. \u201cThis one\u2019s ours. That one\u2019s yours.\u201d He opened his own and once again motioned with his chin, to Noelle this time. \u201cHustle, Tremain.\u201d</p><p>Noelle didn\u2019t budge. \u201cShouldn\u2019t she be wearing protective gear or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that won\u2019t help.\u201d</p><p>Comforting.</p><p>His eyes, as icy a blue as Mia\u2019s, but somehow warm despite that, met Ava\u2019s. \u201cHe\u2019s restrained. You can touch him, even lick him, and you\u2019ll be fine. Just don\u2019t blow him or screw him. That\u2019s when problems arise. So if you don\u2019t think you can resist doing those things ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can resist. Swear to God, I can resist.\u201d Finally, the panic faded.</p><p>He nodded his approval. \u201cTremain. What about that hustle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck. Not that you\u2019ll need it.\u201d Noelle gave her a quick hug before striding past Dallas and into the room.</p><p>He followed and shut the door in Ava\u2019s face.</p><p>After a deep breath, she pivoted on her heel and approached the second door. Her hand shook as she reached out and flattened her palm on the ID box. Blue lights sparked at her fingers, then traveled to her wrist. Entire process took less than two seconds, but those seconds lasted forever\u2014and yet not long enough.</p><p>The door slid open, and she was suddenly peering into a white room that boasted only one frivolity. A mirror. A mirror Dallas and Noelle stood behind. Johnny had been restrained, as promised, his hands cuffed to the arms of his metal chair and his ankles cuffed to its legs. He wouldn\u2019t be able to leap at her, she thought with relief, but he could still spit on her. Bye-bye relief. At least the cold wash of panic remained at bay.</p><p>She raised her chin and marched all the way inside. He watched her, silent. She claimed the chair across from him, a table stretching between them, and studied him. Dark half-circles had formed under his eyes, like Mia\u2019s, only bigger, and raw. Lines of tension branched from his mouth, and his skin possessed a sickly yellow tint. His lips were dry and cracked.</p><p>\u201cNothing to say to me?\u201d Even his voice was different. Lower, harder. Frayed at the edges.</p><p>Just like that, even her hesitation evaporated. This was Johnny. Eager, if clueless, Johnny. She could handle him. \u201cI\u2019ve got plenty to say, actually. We\u2019ll start with how stupid you were.\u201d</p><p>Something thumped against the back of the mirror. Ava imagined Dallas pounding against the shield-armor, wanting to bust his way past the obstruction and slap her for kicking things off with criticism, and Noelle latching onto his forearms and refusing to let go. Dallas probably didn\u2019t conduct his interviews this way, but Ava didn\u2019t care. She had a plan. She was going to irritate Johnny so much he would be willing to answer anything to get rid of her.</p><p>She just prayed it worked.</p><p>\u201cHow could you sleep with her?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>His eyes, glassy and blown, narrowed. \u201cJealous?\u201d</p><p>As she\u2019d learned the day after crawling out of his bed, when he cornered her at her desk and told her that he was willing to give her another chance with him, everything began and ended with Johnny\u2019s ego. \u201cDo you want the truth or a lie?\u201d</p><p>Another thump against the glass.</p><p>Johnny popped his jaw. \u201cShe was hot.\u201d</p><p>Typical, but truthful. Good. \u201cAnd that made who and what she was okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know, damn it! She looked human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd smelled human?\u201d McKell had mentioned a putrid scent.</p><p>\u201cYes, damn it.\u201d</p><p>So only McKell could smell the rot radiating off her? Interesting. That put him in a position of power.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d they send you, anyway?\u201d Johnny demanded. \u201cEveryone knows I had you, and now I\u2019m done with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what everyone knows, is it?\u201d She didn\u2019t try to mask her sarcasm.</p><p>His eyes narrowed a little more, becoming slits, his lashes shielding the emotion in his eyes. \u201cJust ask your questions and get out, Ava.\u201d</p><p>Gold star for her. The plan was a success. Only, it wasn\u2019t pride that accompanied the victory. How sad that a once-future agent had been reduced to this. Just get it over with. \u201cAfter you left the bar, she appeared to you on the street.\u201d A statement, not a question.</p><p>He answered, anyway. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you guys go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStraight to my apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you talk along the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>A lift of his shoulders, followed by a grimace, as if even so small a movement was torture. \u201cAbout how much she liked me.\u201d</p><p>Ava allowed her doubt to show. \u201cYou\u2019re telling the truth? Not exaggerating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not exaggerating.\u201d Those lashes parted, and he pinned her with a dark stare. \u201cSome women find me attractive, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she told him softly. She simply wasn\u2019t one of them. \u201cSo tell me exactly what she said, what she liked.\u201d</p><p>Another shrug, limited because of the restraints and clearly just as painful. \u201c\u2018Oh, Johnny, you\u2019re so strong. You\u2019re so beautiful.\u2019\u201d The falsetto was mocking, dripping with self-deprecation. \u201c\u2018I\u2019d love to see your bedroom. I\u2019d love to touch you.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Didn\u2019t take much to piece together what had happened next. \u201cYou cared only about having sex, not about what kind of person she might be.\u201d Of course.</p><p>He nodded, a stiff jerky motion.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened once you got to your bedroom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe talking stopped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe specific.\u201d</p><p>Fury flashed through his expression, and for one second, one priceless second, he resembled the agent she knew and not the sick, dying victim he\u2019d become. \u201cShe stripped me, stripped herself, then crawled into bed with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you kiss her?\u201d</p><p>Another nod.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d she taste like?\u201d</p><p>He laughed, but it was a bitter song, acrid and hate-filled. \u201cWhat does that matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying to figure this woman out. Trying to find ways to identify her, to destroy her. To prevent her from doing this to other people. To save you.\u201d As she spoke, Johnny\u2019s fury and bitterness dulled, softening his features. \u201cHelp us. Please.\u201d</p><p>Silence. Such heavy silence.</p><p>\u201cWhat if she goes after Jeremy next?\u201d Ava hated herself for playing on what had to be one of his deepest fears, but they were discussing life and death. Victory and defeat. What if the queen went after Noelle? McKell?</p><p>Johnny hung his head, staring down at his lap. Another bout of silence stretched between them, and Ava suspected she had failed. She didn\u2019t know what else to say, but she leaned forward and rested her arms on the table, sliding her hands closer and closer to his side.</p><p>\u201cJohnny. Please. Why won\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know where you\u2019re headed with this, and it\u2019s humiliating,\u201d he snapped, trying to jerk from her coming touch. His chair moved not an inch.</p><p>With a sigh, she settled back in her seat and hooked fallen tendrils of hair behind her ears. \u201cWould you talk to someone else? A man?\u201d</p><p>More silence. Heavier. Then, \u201cShe tasted like ... roses,\u201d he admitted, surprising her. \u201cThat\u2019s the only thing I can think to compare it to even though I don\u2019t actually know the taste of roses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you liked it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ... did you taste between her legs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee! I knew you were going there.\u201d</p><p>Ava didn\u2019t back down. \u201cDid you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he lashed out. \u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>Now they were getting somewhere. \u201cWhat did she taste like there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same. Roses.\u201d</p><p>O-kay. What was so humiliating about that? \u201cDid she come?\u201d</p><p>A growl pushed from his lips. \u201cWhat the hell does that matter?\u201d</p><p>Ah. Finally. The reason for his humiliation. No, the queen hadn\u2019t come that way, and Johnny had taken it personally, as if he were lacking. \u201cThank you for your honesty. Now, afterward, you...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFucked her. Yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did you use a condom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, damn it. I\u2019m not stupid.\u201d</p><p>So. Either the disease was stronger than latex, or Johnny had contracted it through unsuccessful oral sex. Or maybe both. Maybe he\u2019d been doomed either way. Hell, maybe kissing her on the mouth had sealed his fate. \u201cDid she say anything while you guys were having sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She was a moaner, not a talker.\u201d The fury was returning to his tone, laced with annoyance and sprinkled with something else. Something she couldn\u2019t name.</p><p>\u201cDid you see anyone else in your apartment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I was kind of busy concentrating. You remember how devoted I was to your body, right? Now, are we done here? Because I\u2019m fucking tired!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re not done. And let\u2019s keep me out of this.\u201d Any moment now, he would kick her out. That much was clear. How many more questions could she get him to answer before that happened? She gentled her tone. \u201cSo you guys had sex. Did you notice anything different about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what? Like did she have two vaginas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he snarled. \u201cShe seemed human the entire time.\u201d</p><p>One down. Only a thousand more to go. \u201cSo when did you realize you were infected?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen Mia and Dallas busted down my door last night. I woke up ... hungry.\u201d His gaze fell to her chest, where her heart pounded, and he licked his lips. \u201cYeah. Hungry.\u201d</p><p>Ava shifted uncomfortably in her seat, caught herself, and stilled. \u201cIs that hunger the only change you noticed?\u201d</p><p>A stiff shake of his head. \u201cI could hear her voice in my head. Can hear her voice.\u201d Another lick of his lips.</p> <p>She ignored the urge to shift again, pulling herself from his gaze, however briefly. \u201cNow? You can hear her now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>That kind of bond required strength. Just how powerful was this woman? \u201cWhat\u2019s she saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Most times she speaks in a language I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRepeat something.\u201d Maybe Noelle or Dallas would be able to translate. Not Ava, though. That much she knew. New languages had always been difficult for her. In fact, she was lucky she didn\u2019t\u2014always\u2014butcher her own native tongue.</p><p>He opened his mouth, said a word she didn\u2019t understand, no longer whispering, then grimaced. \u201cI\u2014I can\u2019t tell you anymore. Hurts too much.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHurts how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you think? Bad.\u201d</p><p>Was the queen somehow cognizant of what her victims said? Could she control them? Make them feel pain when they displeased her? \u201cOkay, let\u2019s backtrack a moment. Was the Sch\u00f6n queen gone when the agents burst into your home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He once again spoke in that whisper, barely audible. Why? \u201cShe left right after the sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what happened after the sex, before Mia and Dallas arrived?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe dressed and left, and I fell asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d</p><p>Color flooded his cheeks. \u201cYeah.\u201d The creepy, whispering tone had thankfully been absent that time.</p> <p>Liar. Had nothing else happened, he wouldn\u2019t have blushed. \u201cYou might as well tell me,\u201d she said. \u201cI won\u2019t leave until you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really? You want to know that badly?\u201d Again, he licked his lips. Again, he started whispering. \u201cCome over here and ask me nicely. I\u2019ll tell you anything, everything.\u201d</p><p>Oh, no, no, no. There would be none of that. \u201cI\u2019m not going near you, Johnny.\u201d</p><p>Slowly he grinned, and damn if his teeth weren\u2019t longer and sharper than she remembered. She almost flinched, but managed to remain in her seat, still and seemingly calm.</p><p>\u201cWho said my name was Johnny?\u201d Whispering, yet humming with power. The glassiness left his eyes, leaving clarity\u2014and a fathomless knowledge he\u2019d never exhibited before.</p><p>Goose bumps covered Ava from head to foot, and not the good kind, as possibilities whizzed through her mind. A split personality? Insanity? Or something far more sinister? Like\u2014</p><p>\u201cMy name is Trinity, and I\u2019m the queen you seek.\u201d</p><p>Like that. Ava gulped.</p><p>\u201cAfter sex, and before the agents arrived, I told Johnny that I would know all his thoughts, all his actions. I told him I would control him. I told him he would not be my last victim. I told him, or rather, I promised him your precious vampire would be next.\u201d</p><p>Fifteen</p><p>Drip. Drip.</p><p>McKell lay in the heart of his cave, peering up at the rocky ceiling. It was so low, he wasn\u2019t able to stand without scraping his skull and he had to crawl in and out. The side walls hugged him close, keeping him in a tight embrace. Almost like the coffins humans used to theorize about. As if he would actually sleep in a coffin. He wasn\u2019t dead. He was very much alive. More so than ever before.</p><p>Drip. Drip.</p><p>Darkness surrounded him, the sun\u2019s rays kept completely at bay. He always knew when the sun set, however. Or rather, his body knew. A burst of strength would overtake him. Nowadays, so would a burst of hunger. For one person, and one person only ...</p><p>He\u2019d lived in these caverns his entire life, knew which ones were used by other vampires\u2014and therefore ruled by Manus, king of the vampires\u2014and which were not. This one was not, had only one entry, and therefore only one exit, and did not descend deep enough to reach the city.</p><p>Situated a few hours from the human town as it was, in a wasteland with thick, stinging air, topside visitors were discouraged, as well. Actually, he\u2019d never encountered another living being here. And as he could control people and time, traveling back and forth wasn\u2019t a problem.</p><p>Here, he could relax, knowing the doorways wouldn\u2019t find him. Or talk to him. He could sleep without worry. He could dream about digging into the vampire city directly below him\u2014sometimes he thought he could hear the murmur of their voices\u2014defeating Manus, and claiming the throne. Vampires respected might, after all. And if anyone could take down the powerful, mindreading Manus, it was McKell, the man who had led the army for centuries.</p><p>Would he, though? No. His men deserved peace. A lifetime with their families. Too many would die if war erupted, families torn apart. But oh, how he missed his men. Most days, he could ignore the sensation. The hollowness. But every time he came here, he was reminded. They\u2019d fought beside each other, bled for each other, and some had even died for their fellow soldiers. That kind of loyalty didn\u2019t fade just because a king proclaimed McKell a traitor.</p><p>Traitor. As if. He hadn\u2019t killed Bride when he had been ordered. She\u2019d looked up at him with those green, green eyes, so trusting, and he\u2019d spared her. Where was the crime in that?</p><p>Truly, that wasn\u2019t the act of a traitor. Yes, she was what the vampires called nefreti. All-powerful, as he\u2019d told Ava. What he hadn\u2019t mentioned to her was that the nefreti were utterly unstoppable when riled, their natural inclination for survival overriding even the smallest hint of compassion. And yes, a nefreti had killed Manus\u2019s brother, so the royal family had every right to fear them. That didn\u2019t mean all nefreti deserved to die.</p><p>And though he\u2019d saved Bride and cast her to the surface world with every intention of finding her later and tricking the king into thinking she was someone else, though she had then chosen to live with another man, McKell still couldn\u2019t regret his actions. Not in any way. Not when they\u2019d led him to Ava.</p><p>Ava.</p><p>During the night, he\u2019d trailed vampire scents as planned. He\u2019d discovered a large group at a dance club, of all places. Mostly males, but a few females. He hadn\u2019t entered, had merely watched from the shadows outside, next to human garbage cans, hoping to mask his own scent. He hadn\u2019t attempted to question a single one, knowing the rest would run and he\u2019d have no one to observe.</p><p>None had seemed to notice him as they left. Even the times he\u2019d been \u201ctalking\u201d to Noelle on the phone. Chattering baggage. As he\u2019d studied the vampire females, there had been ... nothing, no reaction on his part, and he had reeled.</p><p>The thought of getting to know them on any level had even blackened his mood. The thought of exchanging blood with them had sickened him. The thought of kissing them had left a terrible taste in his mouth.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t replace Ava. Wouldn\u2019t replace her. To always hold his tongue, never speak his mind\u2014hell, no. He wasn\u2019t doing that again. So, Ava stayed. Forever. He would still interrogate as many vampires as possible and learn how to live in this crazy human world. He would still insist Ava help him. The more time he could spend with her, the better. But later dismiss her to mate with a female vampire? Again, no.</p><p>Once he\u2019d made that decision, his entire outlook had changed. From brooding and murderous to happy and eager. He should have known from the beginning. Just thinking about Ava caused him to grin.</p><p>She\u2019d meant to anger him earlier, when she\u2019d mentioned \u201cdoing\u201d someone else. He knew she wouldn\u2019t, though. The way she had kissed him ...</p><p>She had lost herself to the passion. She had moaned for more, clutching at him and rubbing against him. She wanted him. No one else would do for her, just as no one else would do for him. They might not like feeling that way, but they were helpless to change those feelings.</p><p>Thank God.</p><p>She simply enjoyed torturing him. Which was a good thing, he thought with a surge of satisfaction. A point in his favor. She enjoyed torturing Noelle, as well. And as she professed to love Noelle ... did that mean she loved him?</p><p>Better question: Did he want her to love him?</p><p>He planned to stay with her, yes, but love was a huge burden to carry. Mainly because women became so clingy. He had to admit, though, that he liked the thought of Ava clinging to him.</p><p>And if she loved him, she would probably stop resisting his sexual advances. She might even allow him to drink from her anytime he wished. He could move into her home\u2014after he made some improvements, of course\u2014and sleep in her bed, with her in it, every day.</p><p>Yes, he wanted her to love him, he decided. Not just desire him. Not just enjoy him. He wanted her love. So. Rather than simply seduce her, he needed to romance her, as well.</p><p>Simple, easy, he thought. Yeah. Right.</p><p>Ava paced her living room, from the couch to the recliner and back again, her phone pressed to her ear. Finally the ringing ceased, and Mia answered.</p><p>\u201cSnow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you gotten the test results for McKell\u2019s blood?\u201d she asked, bypassing pleasantries. The sun had set a few minutes ago, so she knew McKell was on his way here. Tonight the vampire hunting truly began.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d was the dead-end reply.</p><p>O-kay. She\u2019d known that already. After she\u2019d left Johnny\u2019s cell, she, Noelle, and Dallas had returned to Mia\u2019s office. Her panic at Johnny\u2019s\u2014the queen\u2019s\u2014threat hadn\u2019t yet faded. Still hadn\u2019t faded. Might never fade, actually. McKell assumed he would remain unaffected by the virus, or at least he had when he\u2019d encountered the infected human, but his contact had been minimal. A threat hadn\u2019t wrapped itself around his neck like a noose, tightening, drawing him ever closer to the end.</p><p>Mia had already watched the interrogation feed, and had smacked Ava on the shoulder in a job well done. Then Mia had said, \u201cTwo great discoveries in one day. You\u2019re becoming invaluable, Sans. Keep it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo great discoveries?\u201d Ava had asked. \u201cJohnny was the first, yes, so what was the second?\u201d</p><p>Mia had paled, smacked her on the shoulder again, and told her to go home and rest. Rest. As if that would be possible now, in the middle of a crisis, when it never had been before.</p><p>Ava had spent the last few hours thinking about ways to destroy the queen (nothing had come to her), how to protect McKell from further notice (nothing had come to her), and that second discovery of Mia\u2019s. Finally, one answer had slid into place: McKell\u2019s test results had arrived. Now, she wanted answers.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d she demanded. If God loved her, even a little, Mia would tell her that McKell was immune, there was a cure, and the world was now safe.</p><p>\u201cAnd I decided not to share them with you. You\u2019re too close to him.\u201d</p><p>She peered up at her ceiling. Why do you hate me so much?</p><p>No reply. She massaged the back of her neck. For once, she didn\u2019t deny her relationship with a man. She liked the thought of being close to McKell. \u201cI can get you more of his blood if you need it.\u201d Maybe. Since that \u201cMcKell is next\u201d announcement, she\u2019d been feeling oddly protective of the jerk, wanting\u2014fine, needing\u2014him in top shape.</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t he arrived yet?</p><p>\u201cThen get me more.\u201d Mia\u2019s command promised retribution if she failed.</p><p>She stopped in the center of her living room, wishing she were at AIR and Mia were close enough to slap. \u201cNot unless you share the results. That\u2019s how this works.\u201d Again, maybe. But this was a negotiation. She would say anything necessary to get what she craved.</p><p>\u201cActually, that\u2019s not how this works at all. I\u2019m your boss.\u201d Such a hard, unflinching tone had probably never met with resistance. \u201cYou do what I tell you.\u201d</p><p>She should back down before her ass was fired, but backing down had never been her nature. If it had, she would be stuck in the gutter, addicted to drugs and alcohol like her mother had been, bless her heart, occasionally whoring herself out as the need for a fix overrode any sense of degradation. Or as loser boyfriends requested bail money.</p><p>\u201cActually, Agent Snow, I don\u2019t care who you are. You want the vampire\u2019s blood, you give me the details I want.\u201d On this, she would not waver.</p><p>There was a pause, tense and heavy, then a sigh. \u201cYou\u2019ll make an excellent agent one day, Sans.\u201d</p><p>Astonishing. She\u2019d just refused to play nice, yet Mia had praised her. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t think I\u2019ll let you run over me every time you have a new case,\u201d Mia continued as if she hadn\u2019t spoken. \u201cI like your determination, so I\u2019ll give you a pass. This time. And just so you know, I\u2019ve never given anyone a second pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoted.\u201d</p><p>Another sigh crackled. \u201cOkay. Here it is. My official finding is ... his blood is weird.\u201d</p><p>Ava surged back into motion, but had lost track of where she was and plowed into her recliner, her toe instantly throbbing where she\u2019d stubbed it. Cursing under her breath, she twisted, landed on the cushions, and balanced the phone between her cheek and her shoulder as she rubbed her toe. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWeird? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you know, we can\u2019t take a sample of Sch\u00f6n infected blood because the virus is alive and won\u2019t leave the victim\u2019s body if there\u2019s not a living being nearby. So filling a vial is impossible. To test, we have to feed the vampire blood to an already diseased individual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd were you able to do that?\u201d The only living victim\u2014besides Johnny\u2014was the human from the bar. That she knew of, that is.</p> <p>\u201cNo, but let me backtrack a little. We were able to test McKell\u2019s blood on its own to determine if it was like Bride\u2019s. And in some ways, it is. Much more so than the other vampires we\u2019ve tested.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d had no idea other vampires had submitted\u2014willingly or not\u2014to AIR testing. So what the hell else didn\u2019t she know? \u201cThat\u2019s good, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes and no.\u201d</p><p>More non-answers. Wonderful. Ava fell against the back of the chair, and the stupid thing flattened like a cot. She barely cut off her yelp of surprise. \u201cCould you please give me straight facts?\u201d she asked, shoving her tumbling curls from her face.</p><p>\u201cBride\u2019s blood healed human disease, but left the blood ... untainted, for lack of a better word. Still human. McKell\u2019s rejuvenates human blood, as well, only his ... takes over. It\u2019s so strong, so potent, that the blood it\u2019s mixed with becomes vampire, as well.\u201d</p> <p>If she\u2019d been standing, she would have fallen. \u201cSo anyone who drinks his blood will become a vampire?\u201d She rubbed her throat, mind racing. Had she had a sip? A single drop?</p><p>\u201cYes. Human, animal, doesn\u2019t matter. Whoever ingests his blood becomes vampiric. Just like in those old movies. I\u2019d compare him to a human man with too much testosterone. What makes him vampire practically seeps from his pores.\u201d</p><p>Panic bloomed, and it felt as if thousands of little needles were poking at her. If she\u2019d had a single drop ... No, no. She thought back. He\u2019d sucked hers, but she\u2019d never tasted his. More than that, she was still human, normal.</p><p>Slowly she relaxed. Good. Okay. Fine. But she would be very careful in the future, never forgetting what could happen if a kiss spun out of control. She didn\u2019t want to become a vampire. Ever. To only be allowed to venture out at night? Even McKell hated that. Sure, he was looking for a way to live successfully in the sunlight, but what if he never found it?</p><p>And to only ever be able to drink blood? McKell\u2019s blood, at that, since they were supposedly mates. There\u2019d be no more butterscotch for her. Not without sickening. No, no, and no!</p><p>On the plus side, her always aching body added, McKell might finally view her as good enough for him. Ava frowned. She didn\u2019t want to be considered good enough simply because she had grown fangs. She wanted to be good enough for who she was and what she\u2019d made of herself. On her own.</p> <p>Not that she was thinking about dating McKell. Or sleeping with him. Well, she might be thinking about sleeping with him\u2014stupid fantasies of writhing together, naked and moaning, never left her head\u2014but that didn\u2019t mean she\u2019d ever follow through. Last time they\u2019d ventured down that road, she\u2019d found only disaster. He\u2019d stopped abruptly, left, and now she had no idea where he was or what he was doing.</p><p>\u201cStill there, Sans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Was just thinking, sorry. So, are you going to feed McKell\u2019s blood to Johnny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re still debating. I think I told you that Johnny\u2019s already had some of Bride\u2019s blood, but another thing we\u2019ve discovered is that vampire blood doesn\u2019t always mix well with other vampire blood.\u201d</p><p>What exactly did \u201cdoesn\u2019t always mix well\u201d mean? The recipient exploded? And did it have to do with vampire mating habits?</p><p>Before she could ask, Mia added, \u201cAnother problem with McKell\u2019s sample is that, what if his blood doesn\u2019t destroy the Sch\u00f6n disease? Then we\u2019ll have a Sch\u00f6n-infected vampire who\u2019s stronger than ever and in need of drinking blood as well as infecting others to stay strong.\u201d</p><p>Good point. \u201cSo what would happen if McKell was infected by the Sch\u00f6n?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know. And I\u2019m afraid to find out.\u201d</p> <p>A knock sounded at Ava\u2019s door. She popped to her feet, heart suddenly pounding against her ribs. McKell? Surely not. Like Noelle, he could now let himself in. That didn\u2019t stop hope from sprouting wings and flying through her.</p><p>God, she had to get herself under control where that man was concerned.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the information, Agent Snow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelcome. I\u2019ll expect a new sample ASAP.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get it.\u201d Again, maybe.</p><p>They severed the connection. Ava placed the phone on a side table she\u2019d spent months saving for and padded to the door. McKell\u2019s strong, beautiful image filled the ID screen, a relieving d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu of the last time he\u2019d visited. He was here, and he was fine. And as always when she spotted him, her skin tingled.</p><p>She pressed a few buttons, fingers trembling, and the door slid open. Suddenly, only air separated them. And such sweet air it was. He smelled of the earth, like rain and crisp leaves, yet there was just a hint of butterscotch. On purpose? He wore a fresh black T-shirt, a pair of black slacks, and both fit him perfectly.</p><p>His dark hair shagged around his face, but it wasn\u2019t tangled. The strands were brushed to a blue-black shine. Clearly he\u2019d just come from an enzyme shower. Whose? she thought, hands fisting.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just walk in?\u201d she asked. She wouldn\u2019t throw accusations around. She\u2019d ask nicely. She\u2019d taunted him with her phone call, made it seem like she was going back on her word to mess around with him and only him. Sure, it had seemed like a good idea at the time, a way to show him two could stray. Now ... she would just have to deal with the consequences.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m being polite,\u201d he replied.</p><p>So he was polite now? That was new. \u201cWe have a few things to discuss,\u201d she said, happy that she sounded calm, assured.</p><p>\u201cThen we will discuss them.\u201d He strode inside, a bag slung over his shoulder. That bag, big and bulky, banged into her chest and knocked her backward. No apology was issued.</p><p>Frowning, she followed him into her bedroom. The frown faded as she became enthralled by a vision of McKell stripping, crawling into bed, cocking a finger at her, silently commanding her to join him. Enthralled, yeah, but she panicked, too, because she was already edging down that road again, the one where she forgot the rest of the world and thought only of sex and blood.</p><p>He tossed the bag on the floor and faced her. Questions about his blood could wait. Questions about the shower had to wait, too.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d She jabbed a finger at the bag.</p><p>He squared his shoulders, as if preparing for a fight. \u201cMy things.\u201d</p><p>Duh. \u201cWhy did you bring your things here?\u201d Don\u2019t say you\u2019ll be staying. Don\u2019t you dare say you\u2019ll be staying.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be staying for a while.\u201d His chin lifted, his violet eyes blazed. Just then he was total determination. \u201cYou know, moving in.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, the panic rising in a tide of bile and ice. She\u2019d never allowed a man to move in with her, not even for a single night, and she never would. Not even this one. Especially not this one. Resisting him was already a losing battle. If they were together every minute of every day, and every sultry night, she wouldn\u2019t just lose; she would end up in flames, a pile of ash.</p><p>\u201cI live alone,\u201d she squeaked. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>He crossed his arms over his chest a familiar action that caused his shirt to strain against his biceps. Those perfectly defined, sinewy biceps. She licked her lips, and his still blazing gaze tracked every millimeter of movement. He\u2019s killing me ...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired of racing from my place to yours, then yours to mine.\u201d</p><p>First, he\u2019d done that once, maybe twice. Second, \u201cYou have a place?\u201d</p><p>He nodded stiffly.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s where you showered?\u201d The question slipped out before she could stop it. Nicely, as planned.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His face scrunched with disgust. \u201cI used one of those public places, since I didn\u2019t want to arrive here dirty. Thankfully, though, I\u2019ll never have to use one again. Now that I live with you.\u201d</p><p>Even her relief that he hadn\u2019t used some other girl\u2019s shower didn\u2019t stop her from yelling, \u201cNo, no, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She stomped her foot.</p><p>A mix of anger and confusion flashed over his features before his expression smoothed, and he regarded her with adoring patience. \u201cBe reasonable, Ava, darling. We\u2019re working together. Helping each other. Every minute we spend together is for the greater good.\u201d</p><p>Darling, he\u2019d called her, nearly melting her. He was up to something. She knew it, but that adoration ... that patience ... as if he was willing to do anything to spend a single moment in her presence ...</p><p>Stay strong. \u201cGreater good, huh? How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you learn about Johnny?\u201d An answer in the form of a question.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t know that. Yet. \u201cJohnny\u2019s sick.\u201d And Ava did need to guard McKell. Oh, God. She was caving, trying to talk herself into saying yes to cohabitating.</p><p>\u201cSo that was the queen I encountered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Might as well tell him the rest. \u201cAnd now she wants you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d He blinked but otherwise remained unconcerned. \u201cWhy would she\u2014wait. How do you know she wants me?\u201d</p><p>Now was not the time for that discussion. How would he react if he knew she\u2019d spoken to her diseased ex? And, really, having him here, for a little while and only a little while, might not be so bad. Guarding him was important. She could protect him from the Sch\u00f6n queen. Be there, ready to strike, to save the day.</p><p>Talk about earning respect.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you stay,\u201d she said with difficulty. \u201cOn one condition.\u201d</p><p>He grinned as if he\u2019d just discovered a human blood farm. \u201cI\u2019ve noticed that with you, there is always a condition.\u201d</p><p>Hey! \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly what I said.\u201d He reached out and smoothed a lock of hair behind her ear, patient and adoring again. \u201cNow, tell me about this condition.\u201d</p><p>A tremor slid the length of her spine. How was she supposed to resist him when he did things like that? \u201cI, well, need another sample of your blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked, arm falling back to his side.</p><p>\u201cFor AIR.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re looking for a cure for the Sch\u00f6n disease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they think my blood will help?\u201d</p><p>Did he know how powerful his blood was? Did he know how easily he could turn others into vampires? Probably not. Otherwise, he might have turned Ava already. Despite the fact that feeding her that blood would wed them permanently.</p><p>Actually, no. That didn\u2019t fit his personality. He wasn\u2019t the type to sneak around to get what he wanted. He stated plainly, issued demands, expected those around him to obey, and that was one of the things she liked most about him.</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t know until they do a few more tests. Which means they need a new sample.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my blood. Mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I need it, though. For the greater good.\u201d</p><p>A flicker of frustration, quickly masked. \u201cFine. You may have another sampling. You don\u2019t need to stab me for it, do you?\u201d As he spoke, his voice tightened, and understanding crystalized in his eyes, lightening the violet to a rich lavender. \u201cThat\u2019s why you stabbed me before, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Uh-oh. Caught. \u201cLet\u2019s leave the past in the past, shall we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will if you will,\u201d he said pointedly.</p><p>Meaning what? She had to forget the inferiority complex he\u2019d given her? \u201cVery well.\u201d Maybe. He was as new to this mate business as she was, and commitment was the scariest thing on the planet. Not that they were committed, she added before any part of her could latch onto the thought of permanence. So, of course they had taken jabs at each other. Forgiveness should be easy. Should be.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d The grin he rewarded her with could have melted a frozen bar of chocolate. \u201cI must admit, I expected more of a fight from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelcome. And I\u2019m not unreasonable, McKell.\u201d</p><p>Melted chocolate? No, that grin widened and turned him into a living, breathing butterscotch sundae. \u201cShall we seal this deal with a kiss?\u201d</p><p>The mere suggestion shot lava-hot bolts of lightning through her. \u201cNot yet.\u201d Yes, yes, yes. \u201cFirst, a few ground rules about Chez Sans.\u201d</p><p>Good-bye, grin. \u201cI\u2019ve already agreed to your condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and now you need to agree to the rules.\u201d If she didn\u2019t voice them now, she never would. And was she truly talking with such speed? Trying to get to that kiss? \u201cOne, no leaving your shit around. Two, no walking around naked. Three, no guests. Four, you sleep on the couch. Five, no making calls and jacking up my phone bill. Six, don\u2019t ask me to add anyone else to my security ID. It\u2019s not gonna happen. Seven, don\u2019t leave crumbs of any kind anywhere. Eight, you have to pay rent. Nine, my stuff is my stuff. Leave it alone. Ten, no killing anyone or even drinking from anyone\u2014like, say, delivery boys\u2014on the premises.\u201d</p><p>He listened while tapping his foot. \u201cIs that all?\u201d</p><p>She thought about it, a snap of time that seemed to last forever, then nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d Now how about that kiss ... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen I have a few rules of my own.\u201d</p><p>Oh, no. They weren\u2019t going there. \u201cYou can\u2019t make any rules. This is my home. And now that that\u2019s settled ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re sharing, it\u2019s my home, too.\u201d</p> <p>Frustrating man. \u201cAbsolutely not. The only reason you\u2019re staying is because of my generous nature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRule one,\u201d he said, ignoring her. \u201cI will leave my\u2014shit, is that what you called my precious weapons and clothes?\u2014around if I like. But you may pick them up and store them somewhere of your choosing if they bother you. Two, you may walk around naked anytime you wish. Three, guests are allowed if I approve of them. Four, I\u2019ll sleep in your bed. You may sleep on the couch if that bothers you, but I hope you\u2019ll rethink that. Five, I have your cell phone, so I have no need of your home phone. Six, if I need someone added to the ID, I\u2019ll add them myself. No worries. Seven, I have no problem with this rule. No crumbs. Eight, as I currently have no money, I\u2019m happy to pay rent with my body. Nine, thank you for sharing your stuff. Ten, I promise to only invite delivery girls.\u201d</p><p>Oh, really? \u201cYou can\u2019t drink from anyone but me, moron.\u201d And she\u2019d never been more pleased by that.</p><p>\u201cThen we can both strike rule ten from our list of demands.\u201d How satisfied he appeared, as if he\u2019d backed her into a corner.</p><p>Clearly, he considered himself a clever little boy. Well, she would show him. She closed the rest of the distance between them, his body stiffening a little more with every inch of ground she gained. Rather than hurt him, or jump him, the sexy bastard, she bent down and grabbed his bag. Then she marched to the only window, opened it, allowing moonlight to seep inside, and\u2014</p> <p>Blinked.</p><p>The bag was no longer in her hand. Was nowhere to be seen, actually. Worse, she was once again in front of McKell, and he was smiling that siren\u2019s smile.</p><p>\u201cRule eleven,\u201d she gritted out. \u201cNo manipulating me with your ability.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou manipulate me all the time.\u201d Was that a ... pout?</p><p>She gasped with affront. \u201cI do not.\u201d</p><p>He arched a brow. \u201cDon\u2019t you? You have only to look at me, and I\u2019m putty in your hands.\u201d</p> <p>The confession went straight to her head. This was the first time he\u2019d complimented her, truly complimented her, as if she were his equal\u2014or perhaps even his superior. And she\u2019d thought him irresistible before ...</p><p>\u201cFine. Manipulate time. Can we seal the deal now?\u201d She leaned into him, rising on her tiptoes, flattening her palms on his chest, ready to enjoy the kiss he\u2019d promised her.</p><p>\u201cFirst. My rule eleven,\u201d he said just before contact. \u201cNo other men, Ava. I\u2019m the only one for you, because you ... you belong to me.\u201d</p><p>She froze, popped her jaw, then fell back on her heels, ready to nail his ass to the wall. \u201cActually, I don\u2019t.\u201d He had reduced her to property, like a house or a car. Or a slave.</p><p>\u201cYou do.\u201d</p><p>His insistence was both frustrating and flattering. She focused on the first and ignored the other. \u201cSo, are we hunting vampires tonight or not?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cWe are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, then.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo kiss to seal the deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><p>He gave her another butterscotch grin, and motioned to the door. \u201cAfter you, darling.\u201d</p><p>Sixteen</p><p>Apparently, vampires preferred inebriated humans. They were easier to lure, and no one took them seriously when they shouted about being bitten and partially drained. That was why, after a wardrobe change\u2014the white button-up and dark slacks Ava had been wearing hadn\u2019t been mission-compatible, in McKell\u2019s opinion\u2014she found herself leaning against a metal counter in a fetish bar.</p><p>Bubbles floated through the air on clouds of thick, dark smoke. Pounding music created a dizzying rhythm, and gyrating bodies littered the dance floor. Cages hung from the ceiling, and scantily clad alien females ranging in color from the brightest gold to the darkest silver writhed inside, as if they were captured in the throes of ecstasy.</p><p>How she envied them.</p><p>Pleasure was not on her agenda. \u201cButtered Toast,\u201d she said when the six-armed, blue-skinned bartender finally approached her. BT, the only alcoholic drink that tasted like her favorite candy. A consolation prize.</p><p>He nodded, reaching for bottles, pouring, while fixing someone else a tequila shooter and someone else a rum punch.</p><p>When she had her drink in hand, Ava sipped and turned, surveying the crowd. Lots of faux black leather, face paint, whips and chains. How ... clich\u00e9, she thought. She supposed the vampires could be themselves here, without worrying about fear and recrimination. They could blend.</p><p>Was this the fate that awaited McKell? What if vampires couldn\u2019t live in the daylight? Would he be disappointed? Try and return underground? Or would he embrace this way of life?</p><p>She didn\u2019t like the thought of him clubbing every night, all kinds of skanky girls trying to rub up against him, but she didn\u2019t like the thought of him leaving the surface, either.</p><p>Just find a vampire and get this over with. Even though she doubted vampires they found at night could teach him how to live during the day, but a promise was a promise.</p><p>A few guys were watching her, waiting for her body language to morph from Stay Away to Mating Season. Who to encourage, who to encourage? All of them appeared human to her, but then, as she\u2019d told McKell, so did he.</p><p>So, just how was she supposed to tell the difference?</p><p>She wasn\u2019t, she recalled, as she continued to sip her drink. Okay, she drained it and signaled for another. She was just supposed to lead as many people as possible to the alley outside, where McKell waited. She was supposed to lead them one at a time to minimize the chance of placing herself in harm\u2019s way. Ugh. One at a time would take forever. And how would it look if she kept going in and out of the club with a different person? Everyone would realize she was up to something. Or think she was a whore.</p><p>She didn\u2019t mind the latter\u2014that could actually work to her advantage\u2014but McKell had told her to act shy, demure, and weak. And really, the clothes he\u2019d chosen for her reflected that image. Clothes that had come from Noelle\u2019s bag of laundry. Bitch hadn\u2019t yet picked it up. Anyway, he\u2019d liked the Naughty Librarian ensemble\u2014white shirt, tie, barely-there plaid skirt. With added scarves and leggings, of course, so not an inch of her body was truly revealed, her skin somewhat protected. Ava felt ridiculous. Her curls were knotted on top of her head, and she wore a pair of cat-eye\u2013shaped glasses.</p><p>At least she (kind of) fit in. There was a flaw in McKell\u2019s logic, though. A shy, demure girl would not dress up. A shy, demure girl would not be here, soliciting attention.</p><p>She downed the rest of her second drink, then pretended to stumble forward, planning a quick recon mission around the dance floor. Only, three steps in, someone finally approached her.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she replied.</p><p>For several agonizing minutes, she flirted with him. All the while, his gaze flittered between her lips and her breasts. Fangs never sprouted, but what did she know? Finally, she said, \u201cLet\u2019s go somewhere private.\u201d</p><p>He readily agreed, and she led him to the back of the building, past the door. Cool air caressed her, and so did the guy, his fingers skimming the curve of her ass.</p><p>She jumped out of his reach. \u201cDon\u2019t touch the goods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuman,\u201d McKell said, stepping from the shadows. His features were taut, his hands fisted.</p><p>Great. All that flirting, wasted.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d the guy asked, nervously glancing between them. \u201cYou robbing me? Well, the joke\u2019s on you. I don\u2019t have any cash.\u201d</p><p>McKell fisted his shirt and propelled him into the wall, then motioned Ava back inside with his free hand.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hurt him,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll use my voice on him. Swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019m trusting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me go,\u201d the guy begged, perhaps sensing the menace that constantly poured off of the vampire. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>McKell held tight as Ava entered the building. Determined, she wound her way through the crowd, loosening her tie and unfastening several buttons on her shirt, displaying the lacy edges of her bra, but more importantly, displaying the thudding pulse at the base of her neck. That drew attention, all right, but still not the right kind. Four more men hit on her and all four were human.</p><p>On that fourth trip outside, she noticed a new smattering of blood on the concrete, and realized McKell was punching the guys before sending them on their way. She didn\u2019t scold him. Most likely she would have done the same thing, had the situation been reversed.</p><p>Still. This was getting old, she thought, trekking back inside.</p><p>Two males stopped her before she reached the bar. Both were handsome, and both were switching their focus between her mouth and her breasts, just like the others. These two were of the faux-leather variety, with spiked collars, and crimson-colored makeup painted to look like blood trickling from their mouths.</p><p>Fake vampires, for sure. She almost brushed past them. Almost. They were tall, as muscled as McKell, and danger radiated from them. So did hunger. Maybe ... maybe the painted \u201cblood\u201d was their version of hiding in plain sight.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to retire to the back rooms with us?\u201d one asked, and there was something strange about his formal words and deep voice. Something ... distracting, whisking through her mind, making her forget ... what? who?</p><p>McKell. His name blasted through her mind, and she recalled that she was here to hunt.</p><p>\u201cSo ... would you?\u201d the other asked silkily.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to, wanted to take them outside, but ... no, actually, she did want to go to the back room. Her blood was heating, her body humming. Touching these men would be nice.</p><p>Ava frowned, shook her head. That wasn\u2019t right. The only man she wanted to touch was McKell.</p><p>McKell.</p><p>Again, his name returned her to her senses. He was the reason she was here. Hunting vampires. \u201cI\u2019d rather go outside,\u201d she said. \u201cOut back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You want to go to one of the back rooms.\u201d</p><p>Yes. That\u2019s what she wanted. Wanted so badly. \u201cLet\u2019s go, then.\u201d</p><p>Both men smiled happily, as if they\u2019d never doubted their appeal. And maybe they hadn\u2019t. There was something strange about them, something she should know, and that voice ... her mind fuzzed, and she lost her train of thought.</p><p>They wrapped their arms around her waist and ushered her to the back of the club, where several open doorways loomed. They urged her through the middle one. Why was she allowing them to lead her, again?</p><p>Inside, the smoky air thinned, the bubbles cleared, and she saw several black couches. All occupied. Men and women, men and men, women and women. Roaming hands, straining bodies. Moans and groans. Sex scenting the air. No biting, though. Biting, like McKell needed\u2014</p><p>Once more, she was jarred back into focus. McKell. Vampire. Hunting.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d one of her companions said, urging her the rest of the way inside.</p><p>Hunting smunting. \u201cYes, I\u2014No.\u201d She shook her head, and pressed her weight into her heels. God, what was wrong with her? She shouldn\u2019t be doing this. Didn\u2019t want to do this. Only one man tempted her. \u201cI changed my mind. I don\u2019t want to do this,\u201d she said, pushing her thoughts out of her mouth.</p><p>She managed to disengage from their arms and stride away before they could speak. Why had she even considered being with them? She was McKell\u2019s. Kind of.</p><p>Behind her, she heard sputtering, but the men didn\u2019t chase after her. Good. She would have had to kill them. Although, she should be escorting them\u2014</p><p>Them. She skidded to a halt, frowned. \u201cThem\u201d who? She\u2019d just come from outside, and McKell had just proclaimed her fourth guy human. Right? She looked around. She stood in a hallway, naked bodies painted on the walls. How had she gotten here?</p><p>What the hell was going on?</p><p>Just find McKell one more person and call it a night. There were rooms behind her, she realized. She changed directions and peeked into all three, finding drug users and various sexual acts being performed, but no vampires. Meaning, no one had tapped into a vein like a beer keg.</p><p>But in the middle room, she spotted two men standing near the doorway. They were handsome, as large as McKell, and they watched her intently, hungrily. For some reason, that made her uneasy. The unease intensified when she backtracked into the club and they followed her.</p><p>Get away, instinct demanded. Smoke once again enveloped her, hiding her\u2014but in the next instant, she forgot why she wanted to hide. Forgot the men.</p><p>Just one more person, she reminded herself, marching onto the dance floor and winding through the writhing bodies. Hands reached for her, hips bumped against her. She allowed the music to sink into her bones and propel her into motion, swaying, grinding. Hopefully luring. All the while her gaze scanned.</p><p>A few seconds later, she spotted two faux vampires dancing with a blond female. They seemed familiar somehow, made her heart leap in ... fear? As if she\u2019d dealt with them before. But that couldn\u2019t be right. That ... she had dealt with them, she realized. She\u2019d spoken with them. They\u2019d taken her into that hallway, then somehow made her forget she\u2019d ever met them, and only when she\u2019d thought of McKell had her wits returned.</p><p>And now, their attention was off her and on the blond. Was that why she\u2019d suddenly remembered what had happened?</p><p>Either way, they were vampires. They had to be.</p><p>Her blood chilled, becoming a river of sludge in her veins. They were far more powerful than she\u2019d realized. McKell had warned her, but she hadn\u2019t listened. Stupid of her, and a mistake she wouldn\u2019t make again. These two could play with human memory, hiding what they didn\u2019t like. They could even compel humans to do what they wanted. Look how easily they\u2019d led her to those rooms. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They were snaking themselves around the blonde, who was also human in appearance. She had short, pale hair, her eyes heavy-lidded, her lips parted. She wore a white halter top and a short black skirt. Flaming red high heels revealed black-painted toenails. One man was in front of her, the other behind her, and both licked at her neck.</p><p>Ava debated what to do, how best to lure them outside. Before a single solution presented itself, one of the guys clasped the woman\u2019s hand, tugging her from the dance floor. She willingly followed, perhaps in a trance as Ava had been. The second one stayed close on her heels.</p><p>There was only one thing she could do, Ava realized. Stupid or not, she chased after them. Would have been nice if they\u2019d headed toward the back door instead of the front, but no.</p> <p>They quickened their steps, and she did the same, her heart pounding wildly. When she reached them, she grabbed the one closest to her, stopping him. McKell, McKell, McKell, she thought, as the vampire\u2019s gaze whipped to her. Black eyes, so deep, like a pit, only insanity waited at the bottom. Contacts? And why hadn\u2019t she noticed before?</p><p>He had a beautiful face ... so beautiful ... those eyes didn\u2019t promise insanity, no, no, how wrong she\u2019d been, they promised\u2014McKell, McKell, McKell. She continued her study. The vampire had high cheekbones, lush lips, like McKell\u2019s, but the arm she held lacked sizzle.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t speak,\u201d she said. McKell. \u201cJust head outside with me. To the back of the club. I\u2019ll make you happier than you\u2019ve ever been.\u201d</p><p>The vampire barked something over his shoulder, speaking in a language she didn\u2019t understand and had never heard before. Her brain fogged\u2014until she wondered if McKell spoke that language, too. The fog cleared.</p><p>The other guy stopped and honed in on her, as well. The moment their eyes locked, she knew she was dinner. He nodded. The blonde had stopped, too, and trailed the new direction of his focus. Her eyes narrowed; she might have hissed.</p> <p>McKell. Ava offered both vampires a fake, drunken smile. \u201cLet\u2019s all be quiet, go outside, and have sex.\u201d Too obvious?</p><p>\u201cYou changed your mind.\u201d His voice was cultured, his tone melodious.</p><p>McKell. \u201cI did? I don\u2019t remember.\u201d McKell. \u201cAll I can think about is the fact that I want to be with you.\u201d</p><p>His smile was slow and wicked. \u201cCome, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about me?\u201d the girl pouted.</p><p>His gaze never strayed from Ava. \u201cGo away. This one was our first choice, you a distant second.\u201d</p> <p>McKell. \u201cOutside?\u201d She pointed to the front door, then shook her head. \u201cToo many people that way. Let\u2019s go that way.\u201d Now she pointed to the back door. Where McKell waited.</p><p>He shook his head, dark hair swaying. \u201cThe alley reeks of garbage.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been out there and had noticed a slight smell, but recalled the way McKell had cringed. Just how acute were vampire senses? \u201cAnd the front reeks of car exhaust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re going to a new location. So, are you in or out, beautiful?\u201d The second vampire, the one closest to her, leaned down and whispered, \u201cI hope you say in. The things I\u2019ll do to you ...\u201d</p><p>Though the fog remained at bay, she barely restrained herself from leaning into him. McKell was out there, waiting, but if she protested any more, these men would leave her behind.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s go outside.\u201d The moment they cleared the building, and were distanced from possible hostages, she would scream for McKell. He would come running, and hopefully catch them.</p><p>Rather than lead her out, both men stiffened, sniffed the air.</p><p>\u201cIs there a problem?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cMcKell,\u201d one of them whispered.</p><p>McKell was here? Thank you, thank you, thank you. She scanned the crowd ... searching ... there. She experienced a starburst of giddy relief. He\u2019d come inside.</p><p>He spotted her, as if attuned to her, and scowled. And then, heaven save them all then, he stalked toward her, deadly intent in his gaze.</p><p>The man she held tried to tug from her grip, but she dug in her nails, holding tight. At the same time, she swung her free hand into his nose, smacking the cartilage with the heel of her palm.</p><p>Blood spurted, and he yelped, his knees buckling. The other leapt into a run, leaving his injured friend behind. McKell was too far away to reach him, so Ava sprinted after him, pushing through humans and otherworlders, hearing their curses but paying them no heed.</p><p>Except, when she next blinked, she found herself outside\u2014though she\u2019d never reached the double doors. Another blink, and she was in front of her car\u2014AIR issued and a loan from Mia. A scowling McKell was beside her, a vampire hanging from each of his arms.</p><p>He was manipulating time, she realized, and relaxed.</p><p>\u201cProgram my voice into the car,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>She did, a process that took a minute, maybe two, and in another blink she was inside the car, in the driver\u2019s seat. She looked to her right. McKell now sat in the passenger seat, watching her expectantly. And, if she wasn\u2019t mistaken, with dread.</p><p>Moonlight caressed him, golden and creamy, just as it had in the forest, as if every ray searched until finding him, just to stroke him lovingly. His violet eyes were bright, his lips redder than usual. One of the vampires had punched him, she was sure.</p><p>Speaking of, \u201cWhere are the vampires?\u201d</p><p>He blinked in surprise, the dread a rising deluge, then motioned to the backseat with a tilt of his chin. Had he expected her to balk about the time manipulation? Probably. She\u2019d tried to make him promise not to do it, after all. As dire as the circumstances had been, she wasn\u2019t going to chastise him. She was grateful.</p><p>She turned, gasped. Sure enough, both vampires were unconscious and slumped over each other. Gold star, McKell. He\u2019d done what she hadn\u2019t. Won.</p><p>\u201cThank you for coming to get me,\u201d she said, facing him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ... welcome?\u201d A question, not a statement. \u201cIs this a trick? I didn\u2019t trust in your ability to protect yourself. I caved to worry. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>She chuckled, cutting him off. \u201cNo trick, I swear. I was dying in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDying?\u201d A menacing whisper, the intent to cause suffering in the undertone. He leaned toward her, grabbed onto her, gaze raking her, probing for injury. \u201cI will murder\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot literally dying,\u201d she assured him. \u201cThey were walking all over me, making me forget my purpose.\u201d My morals. She didn\u2019t think she would have let the bastards touch her, though. Or that she would have touched them. In the end, she would have snapped to her senses. Surely.</p><p>McKell eased off her, and smoothed his T-shirt with practiced strokes. \u201cUnderstandable. The dark-haired one, the one you were groping, can talk people into anything, even things they don\u2019t want to do. Well, humans. And he can do so better than most. The other, his brother, can hypnotize.\u201d</p><p>The one she was groping? \u201cIf you consider breaking his nose groping, I feel sorry for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe sent them topside a few years ago, on a hunting raid for food,\u201d he continued blithely. \u201cOnly they never returned, and I never caught word of their defection, so we assumed they were dead.\u201d</p><p>Two years. In all that time, they would have found a way to live here, blending in, perhaps venturing out unharmed during the day, if there were a way to do so. Exactly the kind of answers McKell had been wanting. So. Her first day on the job? Perfection. Tomorrow, she could take him into AIR.</p><p>Ava ignored the twinge of regret in her chest. He\u2019d promised. They\u2019d bargained. She\u2019d helped him capture a few vampires\u2014two equaled \u201ca few\u201d\u2014so all that was left was for him to turn himself into AIR for questioning. Or whatever else they had planned for him.</p><p>She no longer feared that Mia would want to kill him. Not with his potent vampire blood, his ability to scent out the Sch\u00f6n queen, and his kinda sorta willingness to help.</p><p>\u201cSo where do you want to take them?\u201d she asked, thumb jabbing toward their unconscious bounty.</p><p>A moment passed while McKell considered their options. Finally, \u201cOur place.\u201d</p><p>Wait. What? Our place? Our place? No, no, no. That was wrong on so many levels\u2014because she actually liked the sound of it. \u201cOne, we\u2019re not taking them anywhere near my place.\u201d Calm. \u201cTwo, a little fact about me: I like my stuff without blood spatter. And you do plan to beat the answers out of them, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d McKell could have been carved from granite, so hard was his expression. \u201cFine. Let\u2019s take them to Noelle\u2019s place.\u201d</p><p>Ava nodded, breathing in more of that calm. He hadn\u2019t fought her about the apartment being hers and only hers. And that was good. Very good. That was not disappointing.</p><p>\u201cNoelle\u2019s it is.\u201d She programmed the car, and the engine roared to life. A few seconds later they were on the road and headed toward the wealthy side of town. She switched the car\u2019s phone on and said, \u201cNoelle Tremain.\u201d A pause, a crackle of static, and then the number was being dialed.</p><p>Noelle answered on the fourth ring. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Ava?\u201d</p><p>A smack of gum. \u201cThis your new number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. Just borrowed a car from AIR. Listen, we\u2019re on our way to your house. You there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, but I can be there in ten. Who\u2019s we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe and McKell. We\u2019ll be there in fifteen, so that works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s on the menu?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe found two vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found them,\u201d he piped in. Or rather, growled. \u201cAva made out with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not make out with them! They mind-raped me, and I didn\u2019t know what I was doing.\u201d</p><p>Noelle laughed. \u201cThis is going to be a fun night. I can tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway. We need to interrogate them,\u201d Ava said. \u201cBroken bones might be involved. Spilled guts, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome. I\u2019ll get the torture chamber ready.\u201d Click.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t kidding, either. Chez Tremain did indeed have a torture chamber. They\u2019d snuck down there a few times during their high school days, just for funsies and to prove their bravery. Noelle had never told her why the upstanding Tremains had one, but Ava had guessed it had something to do with the girl\u2019s dad. He was dead now, but she suspected he\u2019d been with the secret service or some shit, because he\u2019d always been traveling, and on the rare times he\u2019d been home, odd characters had been in and out of the compound at all hours of the day and night.</p><p>She\u2019d found it very sexy at the time.</p><p>Maybe she was still that awed little high school crush-waiting-to-happen at heart, because the thought of McKell in that dungeon, throwing his strength around, probably flexing, maybe doing some cutting ... sexiest image evah.</p><p>Shivering, she glanced over at him, intending to give him a good eye-fucking, but saw that he was glaring at her. Why?</p><p>No way she\u2019d ask him. Too needy.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s stargaze,\u201d she suggested as a distraction. Without waiting for his reply, she opened the solar panel on the roof, leaned her seat back as far as the shield-armor separating the front and back of the car allowed, then peered up at the night sky. So pretty, the pinpricks of light whizzing past, blurring together.</p><p>The perfect romantic backdrop for making out.</p><p>Damn it. New distraction. \u201cSo,\u201d she said, trampling the silence.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re determined to irritate me tonight, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Irritation. Good. She could work with that. Maybe. \u201cDon\u2019t I do that every night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight you outdid yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m a good agent.\u201d In training.</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t a compliment! But of course you wouldn\u2019t realize that. You\u2019re clueless. First, you smell too good, but you won\u2019t let me have another taste. Second, you touched him. I never told you to touch anyone. I told you to lure vampires outside. Outside. Without touching.\u201d</p><p>Another jealous fit. Soothing, after the other-woman suspicion she\u2019d harbored after their kiss, and then again while she\u2019d waited for him to return to her apartment. She took pity on him, though, because every dark word out of his mouth made her awareness of him electrify.</p><p>\u201cLook, he was getting away from me, and touching him was the only way to stop him. There was nothing sexual about it. I\u2019m not going to be with anyone else while we\u2019re ... involved.\u201d No gagging on her part. \u201cI agreed to your rule eleven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I won\u2019t be with anyone else, either,\u201d he said, and this time, thank you God, this time, he sounded confident. \u201cI only want you.\u201d He grabbed her by the forearms and hauled her into his lap, forcing her to straddle him. \u201cAnd by God I\u2019ll have you.\u201d</p><p>She stared down at him for several heartbeats of time, silent, hands balled on his shoulders, suddenly panting, remembering the way he\u2019d rushed in to save her, how easily he\u2019d done it, the way she\u2019d had to think of him to stay sane, and how easy it had been to think of him at all. How she craved him constantly, how he\u2019d moved in with her, and that wasn\u2019t as repugnant as she\u2019d always feared, how he belonged to her and she belonged to him, and they\u2019d just admitted it.</p><p>How, just then, she couldn\u2019t think of anything she\u2019d rather do than lose herself in his kiss.</p><p>\u201cWe never sealed our bargain,\u201d she rasped.</p><p>He cupped her cheeks, his thumbs brushing the corners of her lips. \u201cThen we had best do so.\u201d</p><p>Their mouths met in the middle.</p><p>Seventeen</p><p>Dallas knew someone had broken into his apartment before he saw the front door was slightly ajar. Not because of a psychic vision, but because a break-in was the perfect ending to his shit-infested day. Oh, and he smelled roses and gunpowder in the hallway. No one in this wing could afford fresh flowers, and gunpowder was only used by street gangs who managed to get their hands on old weapons. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He knew it wasn\u2019t a street gang that had kicked in his door.</p><p>Trinity had found him again.</p><p>He palmed his newest gun, an experimental weapon he\u2019d commandeered after Trinity\u2019s warning at the bar, and punted the door the rest of the way open. Instead of stun or death rays, instead of bullets, this gun ejected darts of poison that broke the blood-brain barrier in an instant, supposedly paralyzing the victim. Or killing. Whatever. Trinity might still be here, might not, and the poison might work on her, might not, but no telling who else had accompanied her.</p> <p>Immediately he saw two males guards stationed on opposite sides of the entry. Their backs were pressed against the wall, offering him their profiles. They knew he was there\u2014a fucking chimp would have known after that door-busting thing\u2014but they didn\u2019t move, didn\u2019t twitch.</p><p>He fired, anyway, nailing one than the other in quick succession. The red darts whizzed through the air and nailed both males in the neck. They groaned, twitched, and collapsed. Excellent. The paralyzing agent worked. Maybe a little too well. Their chests stopped moving.</p><p>Oh, well. They had invaded his home. They deserved what they got.</p><p>Best thing about these darts, though, was that they didn\u2019t cause bloodshed. The tips were shoved through a pyre-crystal before ejection, and the heat cauterized the ensuing wound before a single bead of blood could form.</p><p>\u201cWas that entirely necessary?\u201d a familiar female tsked.</p> <p>The queen. Trinity.</p><p>She\u2019d stayed.</p><p>Dread increased the flow of his blood, which in turn increased the speed of his inhalations. Every lungful of breath infused her scent\u2014roses, stronger now, as if they\u2019d bloomed in a frosted field\u2014with his own, until he wasn\u2019t sure if he was Dallas anymore or if he belonged to her.</p><p>\u201cPut the weapon away, and I\u2019ll reveal myself.\u201d</p><p>He gritted his teeth. He couldn\u2019t see her, but she\u2019d sounded loud enough to be standing right next to him. He wasn\u2019t hers, he reminded himself. Would never be hers. Right now, he was Kyrin\u2019s, the guy who\u2019d fed him Arcadian blood and saved his life all those months ago. The guy who\u2019d made him what he was. Psychic, able to control people with his mind, and fast beyond measure. Not that any of that helped him with Trinity.</p><p>\u201cYou made good on your threat,\u201d he said, sheathing his gun. He didn\u2019t want to, but knew deep down she would stay true to her word. All the while, he stealthily punched in Mia\u2019s number on his cell. Hopefully she\u2019d answer, listen, realize something was wrong, then beat feet to get here.</p> <p>Sure enough, the queen walked around him, from back to front, a second later, fingertip dragging over his shoulder and chest. Only, that finger misted through him, insubstantial. A dart would slide right through her, too, he realized.</p><p>The top of her head only reached his chin. Her hair was dark now, he saw, and chopped to her jaw, but everything else was the same. Those soulful eyes, those soft lips. That flawless skin.</p><p>He spread his legs, hands remaining behind his back, a classic I\u2019m-not-moving-from-this-spot, you-can-totally-trust-me stance.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, deceptively sad. \u201cI infected one of your agents.\u201d</p><p>Are you there, Mia? Did you hear that? Do you know who I\u2019m dealing with? He stored the phone in his pocket. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t an agent, Trin. You don\u2019t mind if I call you Trin, do you? You\u2019re a queen, I know, but I don\u2019t think we need the formality. Johnny was only in training.\u201d</p><p>Trinity whirled full throttle, robe twirling at her feet, eyes glittering. \u201cIn training? Well, that\u2019s disappointing. But no matter. He\u2019ll serve me well.\u201d Her gaze skittered to her fallen comrades. \u201cYou owe me another guard.\u201d</p><p>He owed her? Owed? Bitch. \u201cI killed two.\u201d Were there others here? Others he couldn\u2019t see? \u201cBut you only want me to replace one? Gee. Thanks for the discount.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo discount. I\u2019ve already taken Johnny.\u201d</p> <p>He bristled at this second reminder. \u201cActually, we have him. Not you.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, soft, gentle, and just like before, it was like hearing bells. \u201cNot for long.\u201d</p><p>What did that mean? She\u2019d spring the guy? He\u2019d try and escape? He\u2019d soon die? \u201cSo why\u2019d you pick him, hmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t seem to like him, so I thought I would be doing you a favor.\u201d Another whirl, and she was gliding to his couch. Another, and she was easing down, peering over at him with a half-smile.</p><p>Good. He\u2019d relaxed her. Time to up his game.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re allowed to show your thanks,\u201d she said.</p><p>He arched a brow, a fuck-you expression she would hopefully interpret as a simple refusal, and strode over\u2014careful, have to be careful\u2014then leaned down and tried to pinch a lock of her hair between his fingers. Like mist, cool, whispering.</p><p>\u201cI liked the blond better,\u201d he said. He let his arm fall to his side\u2014See, Trin. You can trust me\u2014praying Mia was even then gathering troops to raid his place. How would they take her down, though, when they couldn\u2019t touch her?</p><p>She stood, never quite brushing him. Before his eyes, those dark strands lengthened and lightened until they were completely devoid of color. He could only watch, wide-eyed.</p><p>To his knowledge, only one other person possessed such an ability. Macy Briggs. An AIR agent who could switch identities with only a thought. Macy could change more than her hair, though. She could change faces, gender, bodies. Everything. They\u2019d always assumed she was harmless. Could she be one of the Sch\u00f6n?</p><p>No, he thought next. She had married a Rakan warrior, and the two had most definitely had sex. For several weeks, Dallas had been the guy\u2019s shadow and had seen some things he\u2019d never be able to scrub from his memories. Yet Breean had never shown signs of cannibalism or sickness.</p><p>\u201cNo reaction to my talent?\u201d Trinity asked with a pout.</p><p>He shrugged, backed up a step. If she thought he feared her, she would become smug. Maybe make a mistake. Maybe materialize. But he couldn\u2019t outright admit to being afraid. She\u2019d know he lied. \u201cI\u2019ve seen better.\u201d</p><p>Anger darkened her eyes, but was quickly masked. \u201cHave you, now? Well, I\u2019m new at camouflage. In a few weeks, I\u2019ll be as adept as your Macy Briggs.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t show your surprise. \u201cSo you\u2019ve met Macy?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged now, a mimic of his. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been properly introduced, no.\u201d</p><p>So she\u2019d watched the agent, studied her. Learned from her. And Macy had never known, or she would have said something. Hell, Dallas had never known. \u201cAnd you picked up her ... talent.\u201d He snapped his fingers. \u201cJust like that?\u201d</p><p>Trinity turned slowly, offering her profile like a model on a runway, before looking at him over her shoulder. \u201cYes. Just. Like. That.\u201d One step, two, she walked away, not leaving the living room but pacing circles in the center. Caging him. \u201cThat\u2019s my way. I see, I want, I have.\u201d</p><p>Refusing to be cowed, he followed her. Watched. She ghosted through his laundry, empty beer bottles, food wrappers, and video games. Dallas had a little problem cleaning up after himself. Someone usually took pity on him and hired a maid (Devyn) or did the work herself (one of his many bed partners).</p><p>\u201cThat makes you selfish,\u201d he said casually.</p><p>\u201cThat makes me happy. Others merely wish they could take. I actually can. Why shouldn\u2019t I enjoy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause those others get hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I give them a gift. They become like me. Able to adapt to anything. Able to do anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as they continue to infect others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. A small price to pay when given so much in return.\u201d</p><p>The destruction of living beings was \u201ca small price\u201d? \u201cSo what happens when everyone in the world is infected?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey start killing each other.\u201d No remorse. Not even pretend this time.</p><p>\u201cBut you continue on to another planet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is that a gift, then?\u201d Where the hell are you, Mia? He began to wonder if she\u2019d ever picked up. If he\u2019d simply gotten her voice mail, and she wouldn\u2019t hear this conversation until tomorrow, when it would be too late to do anything.</p><p>\u201cFor the time they live as Sch\u00f6n, they\u2019re powerful. Beautiful. Beloved by their lovers, if feared by outsiders. Better to have such things for a short while than to live forever without ever knowing true power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t give your victims a chance to pick. You force.\u201d</p><p>She spun, facing him, eyes blazing, before again giving him her back and pacing those circles. Along the way, she danced a hand through the clothes, looking them over this time and then forgetting them. \u201cUntil they experience it, they don\u2019t understand the joy I\u2019m offering.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, cannibalism and slavery, two words he\u2019d always associated with joy. \u201cWhy have you given me a choice, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are unlike anyone I have ever met. You are two races, Arcadian and human, something that should be impossible. And ... I think I like the way you resist me. A novelty, I\u2019m sure, and one that will eventually fade, but your spirit is pleasing for the moment, so I have no desire to damage it.\u201d</p><p>Had to be a lie. Otherwise, she would have seen the critical flaw in her plan. \u201cIf we sleep together, and I\u2019m infected, that spirit you just praised will be damaged.\u201d Johnny now lived for her and her alone. Johnny did whatever she wanted and nothing she didn\u2019t. Hell, she even talked through the guy, threatening the vampire, McKell. \u201cYou won\u2019t have what you desire most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow like you to think that you are what I desire most. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I like you, I do. And like I said, I\u2019m intrigued by you. But I\u2019m willing to sacrifice you without any hesitation to get what I truly want.\u201d</p><p>That shouldn\u2019t have irritated him. He didn\u2019t want to be wanted by her. \u201cSo what do you truly want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t for you to know.\u201d</p><p>She would say no more on the subject. There had been finality in her tone, as well as irritation. If he wasn\u2019t careful, she would leave before Mia arrived. If Mia arrived. \u201cFor the record,\u201d he said, changing the subject. \u201cI like all AIR agents. Those in training, those out of training. So don\u2019t do me any more favors, okay?\u201d</p><p>A raspy chuckle escaped her. \u201cI warned you I would infect someone. You even know my next target.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless I sleep with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that you can speak through me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said again.</p><p>In the light, her blond hair resembled fallen snowflakes. Fitting, since she still smelled of rose-covered ice mountains. Idiot. \u201cWhy not use one of the men you\u2019ve already infected? Mia wouldn\u2019t balk about speaking to one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour people do not trust them.\u201d She tossed him a grin. Fleeting, but soothing.</p><p>God, she was gorgeous. What would it be like to kiss that grin off her face? What would it be like to hold her, have her?</p><p>Clearly, the more time he spent with her, the more she dominated his thoughts. Much more, and he\u2019d be begging to bed her. He\u2019d give Mia five more minutes. If she failed to arrive, he\u2019d do something to piss off Trinity and make her leave.</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t trust me if I\u2019m infected,\u201d he said, returning to the conversation.</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t care that you\u2019re different. They love you. That much is obvious. They\u2019ll do anything, even bargain with me, to keep you alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you wish to bargain for? Tell me that much, at least.\u201d</p><p>Another grin, just as fleeting, but making him crave. \u201cI will leave this planet, cause no more harm, if your Mia will give me that which I desire most.\u201d</p><p>He experienced a pang of regret. Get yourself under control, damn it. \u201cAnd that is?\u201d</p><p>Finally she stopped, faced him. There was no hint of amusement this time. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you after you sleep with me. Not before.\u201d</p><p>He closed the rest of the distance, careful, so careful, and flattened his hands on what should have been her shoulders. Still that mist, that coolness. \u201cLet me feel you,\u201d he beseeched softly.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you can. Because you\u2019re not afraid.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t stiffen, as he\u2019d expected, but softened against him, leaning into his chest. Slowly, her body warmed, became solid. Her appeal, far greater. The scent of roses mated with his every cell, his mind clouded with more thoughts of kissing, touching, and he had to force himself back on track.</p><p>\u201cDid you offer this bargain to the other planets you ... visited?\u201d Destroyed. He slid his hands down her back, along her spine, and stopped at the curve of her waist.</p><p>She nodded, her hair tickling his chin.</p><p>Perhaps she didn\u2019t realize what she\u2019d just admitted, but he did. Those planets had been unable to deliver, whatever it was. Which meant Mia, and therefore Earth, would most likely be unable to deliver. So he would have sacrificed himself for nothing. No thanks.</p><p>Closer he leaned ... hoping to distract her with his nearness so that she wouldn\u2019t notice that he had removed one of his hands from her body, was even then shifting that hand behind his back, reaching for the dart gun. \u201cMaybe I can get it for you,\u201d he whispered into her ear. \u201cOn my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t.\u201d Her eyes were luminous blue pools.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m a man, and you need a woman?\u201d His fingers curled around the hilt, even as he fought the urge to kiss the shell of her ear.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour one-word answers are annoying.\u201d Silkily said. He could ignore temptation no longer. He kissed the shell of her ear, soft, light. Her disease spread through bodily fluid. He could lick every inch of her skin and remain unaffected. A thought he shouldn\u2019t have relished, but one he did. This close to her ... yes, lick. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She sucked in a breath. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he insisted, forcing his mind to return to the mission. Not kissing, not licking. He fisted the back of her robe, preparing to strike. \u201cBecause I\u2019m not in charge? Well, Mia isn\u2019t either. Not really. There are a lot more powerful people out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She pulled from him, danced around him. He spun with her, never giving her a glimpse at what he still held behind his back. Thankfully, she stopped in the same position as before. Facing, close. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been to many, many planets, and one thing is always the same. The military, especially the forces patrolling otherworlders, is revered. Unquestioned. Mia might have bosses, but her troops will obey her. Not her bosses.\u201d</p> <p>Again, he didn\u2019t think she realized what she\u2019d admitted. What she wanted involved the military, which involved national security. \u201cHate to break it to you, baby, but AIR is questioned all the damn time. There\u2019s even an Alien Pride parade scheduled later this week, to protest the need for us.\u201d Had she known what he\u2019d been planning? Was that why she\u2019d danced around him?</p><p>Her hands glided over his belt before tracing up his shirt. \u201cDo you want me, Dallas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d He kissed the shell of her ear again. His tongue inched out, but just before contact, he lifted his head. No. \u201cThat\u2019s not difficult to figure out, I\u2019m sure.\u201d He was hard as a rock, and that rock was pointed directly at her like a heat-seeking missile. He wanted to rub.</p><p>She chuckled. \u201cTrue. You do, you want me. But your erection isn\u2019t the reason I know. I\u2019m a mind reader.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d wondered. \u201cAre you now?\u201d If that was the case, he was in trouble. She would know that he\u2019d called Mia. That Mia might be on her way. That he was still holding the gun. Yet here Trinity stood, unmoving, unafraid.</p> <p>\u201cOh, yes. I am.\u201d</p><p>Why tell him, then? Why give away the advantage? \u201cThen tell me what I\u2019m thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you\u2019ll do anything to be with me.\u201d</p><p>Maybe she could mind-read; maybe she couldn\u2019t. But the true power, he realized, was that she could make him want whatever she said. She\u2019d spoken, and the words had blasted through him, reshaping him, making him desperate. He would do anything to be with her.</p><p>Fight. You have to fight. She was a killer, he reminded himself. Dangerous. Destructive. He tried to force his hand into motion, to shoot her at last, but a heavy lethargy settled in his limb, stopping him. Before he could panic, he thought he heard hinges squeaking behind him.</p><p>The cavalry?</p> <p>He spun Trinity with the arm still on her, the one still working. \u201cYou can read my mind? Tell me why I just did that?\u201d Hopefully she would think he\u2019d done it simply to test her ability, never realizing any agent who entered his living room would now have a direct shot at her back.</p><p>She gazed up at him, all little-girl innocence and burning sensuality. A sultry combination. How many men had fallen for that act? Countless, he was sure. Because it made his mouth water even though he knew the consequences.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move me like that again,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t if you swear not to infect anyone else.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cJust give me time to think about your offer. Okay? Just a little time.\u201d From the corner of his eye, he saw three black-clad agents tiptoe from the hallway, weapons drawn. Oh, yes. The cavalry was here.</p><p>Trinity smiled, a little sad now. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Dallas.\u201d</p><p>Stall her ... \u201cBecause you won\u2019t give me any time?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. For your pain.\u201d</p><p>They fired. She disappeared, and each of the rays\u2014two stun and one pyre\u2014slammed into his stomach.</p><p>Fuck! The burn was massive, consuming. He would have collapsed, would have grasped his stomach to staunch the flames, but the stun rays had frozen him in place.</p><p>In unison, the shocked agents ripped off their masks, and he saw Mia in the middle, Devyn at her left and Hector at her right.</p><p>Mia was pale as she rushed to him. \u201cShit! I\u2019m so sorry. Get the medics in here,\u201d she yelled over her shoulder. \u201cNow!\u201d Then she grabbed one of the shirts on his couch and pressed it into his wound.</p><p>Motherfucker! That pyre-fire was a kill wound, having burned a hole just below his ribs, scorching one side of his intestines. He\u2019d endured this type of wound before. That\u2019s when Kyrin had fed him Arcadian blood. He\u2019d healed then, and he would heal now. That didn\u2019t lessen the pain, though. He couldn\u2019t even curse out loud.</p><p>\u201cFuck! I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Mia babbled. \u201cWe thought she was unaware. We had a clear shot. We took it. I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s all right, he tried to project. He would have done the same thing.</p><p>\u201cDallas, man. I tried to lock her in place with my mind.\u201d Devyn could control other people\u2019s energy, but more and more, otherworlders were learning to prevent him from doing so. \u201cThought I had, really, the moment Mia gave the command to fire.\u201d He scrubbed a hand down his face. \u201cI don\u2019t know how the queen escaped.\u201d</p><p>Hector, the asshole, seemed to take everything in stride. \u201cGot any beer in the fridge?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Mia slapped the agent\u2019s shoulder. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, show a little sensitivity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Hector threw up his arms. \u201cEveryone in this room knows he\u2019s going to be fine.\u201d</p><p>Not many people knew of Dallas\u2019s change from human to otherworlder, but Hector was right. The three of them did. Still. Would a little worry have been amiss?</p><p>\u201cPlus,\u201d Hector continued, unaffected by Mia\u2019s hate-filled glare. \u201cYour frantic call dragged me out of bed, and I\u2019m thirsty. So ... Dallas. Beer? Blink once if the answer\u2019s yes.\u201d</p><p>Stun affected limbs and jaw, not eyelids, not heartbeat, not lungs. He blinked, but prayed Hector could read the fuck-you blazing in his eyes.</p><p>Chuckling, Hector patted the top of his head and sauntered off. Prick.</p><p>Finally, in sprinted three guys with a gurney. They managed to lift him up and lay him flat. Hurt like a bitch. There was a sharp sting in his forearm, then drugs were pumping through his system, at last dulling the pain and weaving dark over his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou die,\u201d Mia said, \u201cand I\u2019ll kill you real bad.\u201d</p><p>The perfect lullaby, he thought dryly, and allowed himself to drift away.</p><p>Eighteen</p><p>McKell flattened Ava against the seat, pinning her with his weight. She didn\u2019t seem to mind. No, she reached up, one hand tangling in his hair, nails biting into scalp, the other sliding down his spine, riding the ridges and leaving a path of fire.</p><p>Time was his enemy just then. So was his body. He had just meant to kiss her. To soften her. To begin her seduction, their romance, their life. Instead, their lips had met, their tongues had thrust together, he\u2019d tasted her candy-sweetness, felt her luscious heat, heard her gasp his name, and he\u2019d become lost. Lost with no hope of being found. Now he only cared about completion.</p><p>He felt like he\u2019d been waiting for this moment, this woman, all the centuries of his life. He didn\u2019t care that vampires slept in the seat behind them, didn\u2019t care that the woman in his arms was human and unworthy.</p><p>Actually, unworthy did not apply, and he knew it never had. Ava was worthy of him. He was unworthy of her. She had hunted bloodsuckers for him, and even though they had been stronger than her, she\u2019d held her own, punched one and chased the other. Her determination was unparalleled.</p><p>\u201cMcKell.\u201d Another gasp of his name. \u201cAre you daydreaming? Let\u2019s do this!\u201d</p><p>He reacted to her eagerness with an insatiable growl of approval. The exotic benediction in her tone ... if he let her, this woman would be his downfall. He kissed her, hard and deep.</p><p>When she arched her back, mashing her breasts, so wonderfully plump, into his chest, he wanted to let her. Falling seemed ... fun. No one else had ever fit him so perfectly. Or made him ache so desperately. Or controlled his body quite so forcefully. She walked into a room, he grew hard. She spoke, he grew hard. She allowed herself to be tugged into his lap, he grew hard as a steel pipe.</p><p>\u201cSpread,\u201d he demanded.</p><p>She opened her legs farther, allowing him a deeper cradle, and he took it greedily, rubbing against her. Full contact, cock to feminine core. Only thing preventing him from shoving deep inside her was their clothing.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ... that\u2019s ...\u201d She groaned, eyes squeezing shut, nails still digging, slicing.</p><p>He watched her and lost his ability to breathe. Beauty. Such beauty. Not even the vampires could hope to compare. Passion colored her cheeks, the length of her lashes cast shadows, and her lips, red and wet, glistened in the moonlight like a thousand tiny rubies shaped into a heart. Her amber curls were splayed around her delicate face, a wicked frame to a heavenly canvas.</p><p>He wanted their clothes gone. He wanted the vampires killed. No one else should ever see Ava like this. No one. He wanted out of the car, where they were trapped between the seat and the dash. Although the lack of space forced them to press as closely together as they could, so her every exhalation caressed his face, her scent enveloping him, the air charging with their arousal.</p><p>Her eyelids cracked open, revealing a sliver of those toffee irises and blown pupils. \u201cYou stopped kissing. Again. We done?\u201d</p><p>He was panting, sweating. \u201cNot even close.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t just kiss her, he decided. He would touch her. All of her. Despite their surroundings, their potential audience.</p><p>McKell just kind of fell on her, then, tongue plundering. She welcomed him with abandon, taking, giving. He, too, took and gave. He kneaded her breasts, her pearled nipples abrading his palms. Her heart slammed with so much force, he felt the beat inside his own body. And her blood rushed through her veins, a determined stream that created a roar in his ears. A delicious roar.</p><p>His mouth watered as his fangs sharpened, lengthened. Just being around her, he could barely keep his hunger under control. Kissing her, there was no such thing as control, the fine threads broken completely. There was only need and desire.</p><p>Would he ever get enough of her?</p><p>Her tongue scraped one of those fangs, and a bead of her blood slid down his throat. He swallowed with a moan, warmth instantly pouring through him, strength fast on its heels. No. He would never get enough.</p><p>\u201cMcKell,\u201d she rasped, tunneling her fingers under his shirt. Skin to skin ... heaven, hell. Salvation, damnation. Everything, nothing. Her, just her. \u201cTake more,\u201d she pleaded. \u201cPlease, take more.\u201d Then, for a moment, she froze. \u201cBut don\u2019t you dare give me your blood. Please? Okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d But oh, he wanted to, he realized. Wanted to mate them permanently, forever. Prove to her, to everyone, that she was his. Only his. Finally. He wouldn\u2019t marry them, though, because they had a few things to settle first. He doubted her reason was the same, so her absolute refusal to drink from him irked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill you if you do.\u201d Even as she spoke, she relaxed, arched, body becoming fluid against his. \u201cI swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Ava. More kissing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>His woman wanted his mouth elsewhere. He could oblige. Smile forming, he licked the pulse at the base of her neck. \u201cEverywhere.\u201d</p><p>She scratched his back, stinging so good, before stiffening again. \u201cWait. I ... we ... maybe we should ... I don\u2019t know, slow down.\u201d</p><p>If by \u201cslow down\u201d she meant \u201cgo faster,\u201d he was on board. \u201cWhy?\u201d His tongue stroked that still gorgeous pulse, tracing the vein, heating the blood inside, preparing her for total possession.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t my type?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d probably meant the words as a statement, not a question, and he took offense. He stopped grinding, stopped licking. Only glared. \u201cWhat kind of man is your type, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d As her nails glided forward, scraping his pectorals, she lifted up and nibbled on his bottom lip. \u201cRich and cute. I\u2019m flexible on the cute part, though.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes, savoring her attentions. She didn\u2019t want to slow down, then. Had only uttered the words because she felt they were expected of her. \u201cI can obtain money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly?\u201d</p><p>He thrummed her nipples, making her gasp. \u201cYou said nothing about being rich through honest means.\u201d</p><p>A shiver moved through her and vibrated into him. \u201cOh, well, then. Scratch the money part. I want cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re dazzling. But no one can know about us until the case is over. Assuming we\u2019re still together, then. Okay? That\u2019s the only way I can allow this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll still be together then.\u201d Best she know that now, though this reaction was far better than the panic she\u2019d offered when he\u2019d moved in. Still. That she wanted to hide him, as if he were shameful ... he didn\u2019t like it, wouldn\u2019t allow it for long, even for the good of the case. For the moment, however, he wanted her and would have given her the moon and stars had she asked. \u201cBesides, if you kiss a man, but no one knows about it, it never really happened. Like the tree that falls in the woods ...\u201d</p><p>A moment passed, their panting breaths the only sound to be heard. Then she smiled slowly, wickedly, arousal blending with satisfaction. \u201cThere\u2019s a new requirement for my list. A devious mind, and baby, you\u2019ve got that, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you want me?\u201d he asked, rewarding her with another heated lick, this one up the column of her delicate neck.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d A gasp. \u201cBut if you\u2019re just doing this to soften me, to get on my good side for a blood donation\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He pressed, his erection playing hide and seek with her sweet spot. \u201cYou have a good side?\u201d Raw tone, taunting words.</p><p>Her next moan was broken, hoarse. \u201cHa, ha. I mean, if you\u2019re going to prime me up, then demand I give you blood as payment, I\u2019ll kill you. I swear to God I will. And yes, you now have two death threats hanging over your beautiful head.\u201d</p><p>He pressed again, silencing her, his cock practically singing at the contact. \u201cIf you meant to prime me up only to demand I finish you off, I\u2019ll have no problem with that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSmart-ass.\u201d She tongued his mouth, hot and clearly as hungry as he was. \u201cBut you\u2019re so devious, and you know how that revs my engine.\u201d</p><p>He released one of her breasts to blaze a trail down the flat plane of her stomach. Her soft, quivering stomach. She had several blades strapped there, and he twisted them aside to dabble at her navel for a moment, unable to help himself. Such delightful skin. By the time they ended this, he would have explored all of her. Every burning inch.</p><p>\u201cMcKell,\u201d she moaned, and never had his title sounded sweeter. \u201cYou\u2019re priming me.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d waited all these centuries for Bride, but now, more than ever, he couldn\u2019t regret that he hadn\u2019t won her. He would have missed this opportunity. He would not have seen Ava like this, consumed by pleasure, beseeching him for more.</p><p>\u201cJust as you\u2019re priming me. But Victor, darling. My name is Victor.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know. Can I call you Vicki?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled softly. Irreverent baggage. Even now, while the pleasure beat so strongly between them. \u201cYou can call me whatever you wish.\u201d But it wouldn\u2019t get her what she needed.</p><p>He unfastened her jeans, creating a gap just large enough for his hand. Trembling, he tunneled through and found her panties. They were damp.</p><p>She thrashed her hips restlessly. \u201cDo it. Please.\u201d</p><p>And now his irreverent baggage was a commander. He liked. Not that he would obey.</p><p>Remaining on the outside of the fabric, he cupped her. Still he felt the heat, the wetness. His cock, already hard and desperate, filled all the more, making him impossibly harder, and far more desperate.</p> <p>The car eased around a corner, tilting to the left, and they pressed deeper into the seat. Streetlamps stood closer together, and as they continued to speed down the roads, Ava was illuminated, then cast into shadows. Illuminated, shadows.</p><p>My beauty, he thought proudly. He traced the soft skin around the edge of the panties, never quite touching the place she needed him most. Over and over he teased her. Almost caressing her clitoris ... teasing ... no, not this time. Light as a feather, letting her know he was there, that he could do more at any second. Nope, not this time, either.</p><p>Finally, she had clearly had enough, her desire, her need, propelled to new heights, her hips following his every motion, her skin a fever of sensitized nerves. Yet still he didn\u2019t touch her there. Just a little more ... nope, missed again.</p><p>She balled her fists and pounded on his chest. \u201cDo you need a map?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But I do need confirmation.\u201d Not doing what she wanted, what he wanted, was putting a strain on his body. Perspiration sheened his skin. His blood was like fire in his veins, scorching him to ash. The ache inside him ... Each of his muscles was taunt, his skin pulled too tight on his bones.</p><p>\u201cOf what?\u201d She went still, a goddess carved from stone. To find relief? Even in so small a way?</p><p>He would give her none. \u201cI need confirmation that you know who\u2019s here with you. That you know whose hand you crave.\u201d The hand in question finally glided over her center. A quick movement, only slightly more satisfying.</p><p>A reckless cry parted her lips. \u201cYours. I know it\u2019s yours.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd who am I?\u201d Another glide, this one lingering. He\u2019d just found the corridor to heaven; he could no longer stay away.</p><p>Another cry filled the space between them. \u201cWhy do ... you want ... to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you forgetting later.\u201d Direct hit. \u201cI don\u2019t want you thinking back and convincing yourself you were with the wrong person. Someone better suited to your list.\u201d Direct hit, harder, more forcefully.</p><p>\u201cThat only happened once!\u201d Her knees squeezed at his waist.</p><p>\u201cAva.\u201d A warning. The only one she\u2019d get. Not that he thought he had the strength to leave her like this.</p><p>She flashed her teeth at him, pearls in the darkness. \u201cYou said you\u2019d finish me off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I will.\u201d He was the one to go still this time. Any more contact with her sweet femininity, and he would take her all the way. \u201cWithout asking for blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you already took some. You sucked on my tongue.\u201d</p><p>And you begged for it. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have a problem with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust ... finish me, damn it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you tell me what I want to hear.\u201d Please.</p><p>A low growl erupted from her throat. \u201cFine. You\u2019re McKell.\u201d</p><p>He flashed his teeth at her, and they were much, much sharper. \u201cWho. Am. I?\u201d</p><p>A pause. Then, a snarled, \u201cVictor, okay? You\u2019re Victor. Now, will you stop with the he-man act and get to\u2014\u201d</p><p>He shoved her panties aside and thrust his finger deep inside her. The cry that next left her was neither reckless nor relieved. The cry that left her was animalistic, her back shooting off the seat. In and out he penetrated her, those silky walls gripping him, greedy for more.</p><p>More, he could give. He inserted a second finger, stretching her.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>In. Out. Hard. No mercy. He had none. She wanted none.</p><p>\u201cThank you! Yes, please, more.\u201d</p><p>He bit through her shirt, her bra, not hard enough to break skin, but just hard enough to suck her nipple into his mouth and flick his tongue against the jeweled peak. What color was this nipple? he wondered. He wanted to see. Wanted her naked. Yes, he\u2019d seen her before, but she\u2019d been unconscious then, not lost to passion. Would that passion flush her skin to a dusty rose?</p><p>Through the speakers, he heard one of the vampires in the backseat moan, as if about to waken.</p><p>Mine! McKell stopped time only long enough to open the shield-armor separating front and back, punch the bastard in the nose, causing blood to splatter, then command the block to return. He resettled on Ava, fingers probing back inside their new favorite spot, never missing a beat. She gripped his shoulders and continued to slam her hips into his, rocking against him with every ounce of her strength.</p><p>His cock loved every motion, every point of contact, swelling, heating, her fever becoming his, his becoming hers. He\u2019d never spilled his seed inside his pants, but he was close to doing so with Ava, his sac drawn tight, every inch of him wanting to crawl inside her\u2014and if he couldn\u2019t, punish him for the lack.</p><p>\u201cClose,\u201d she rasped.</p><p>\u201cCloser.\u201d He razed his fingertip along that bundle of nerves and pressed.</p><p>\u201cMcKell!\u201d she shouted, inner walls suddenly clutching him. Her come drenched his hand, and he had to bite the inside of his cheek to stop his own orgasm. Oh, yes. He\u2019d never been this close.</p><p>Several minutes passed before she relaxed into the seat. They were both panting, but a resplendant smile lifted the corners of her lips. She stretched, a contented feline who\u2019d just consumed an entire bowl of cream.</p><p>\u201cYour turn,\u201d she said silkily. \u201cI got caught up and forgot about you. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. I\u2019m not.\u201d Slowly, reluctantly he removed his fingers from her. As she watched, he licked them, one at a time, finally tasting her as he\u2019d longed to do since the first moment he\u2019d met her. Though she had just experienced the ultimate in satisfaction, desire once again heated her eyes.</p><p>\u201cDelicious,\u201d he said, and meant it. Total femininity, an aphrodisiac. Sweet.</p><p>He ran a still-damp finger over the seam of her lips, bent down, and fed her a kiss. To his surprise, she reached between their bodies and fit a hand over his engorged shaft. So sublime was the sensation, he had to reach up and slap his palm against the windowpane. The glass cracked from top to bottom. He didn\u2019t care. Either he hit the glass, or punched the seat below her, possibly scaring her.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d he cried. \u201cMore.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed, moved that hand up and down, tantalizing his tip, spreading the drop of moisture there, even through his clothes, then descending to his balls and tugging those. Closer still ...</p><p>The car slowed, then stopped as Ava worked his zipper. Sweat heaven, yes! He needed this, had to have it, would die\u2014</p><p>There was a knock on the door.</p><p>Rage sparked to instant life, and he twisted, meaning to lash out, to kill without mercy, then return to his woman and finally finish this. A smiling Noelle waved at him, unafraid of his murderous intent. She even wiggled her eyebrows suggestively.</p><p>\u201cGo the fuck away!\u201d he shouted.</p><p>\u201cNot until I\u2019ve had a little of this,\u201d Ava said with a husky chuckle.</p><p>Noelle mouthed something, but because of the glass and the roar in his ears, he couldn\u2019t hear. But then, he didn\u2019t need to hear to know what she\u2019d said. \u201cOpen.\u201d The window lowered, and she leaned inside, still grinning.</p><p>\u201cHey, y\u2019all. Whatcha doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoelle?\u201d Ava stiffened. A moment later, she was shoving at McKell\u2019s chest. \u201cDamn it! I can\u2019t believe we\u2019re already here.\u201d</p><p>He lifted, straightened, and righted his clothing while she righted her own, her cheeks bright red. His probably were, too. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you live farther from the club?\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>Noelle\u2019s grin widened. \u201cSo I can enjoy moments like this. Duh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you don\u2019t have to stare,\u201d Ava gritted.</p><p>\u201cI know, but I want to,\u201d Noelle replied, still completely unabashed.</p><p>\u201cYou are such a bad friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bad friend. I\u2019m still waiting on my laundry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing mine now. Remember?\u201d</p><p>He listened to the byplay, trying to get his body under control. Impossible. The fire continued to rage, his muscles continued to twitch, and his cock continued to ache. It was going to be a long night. Unless ... \u201cGo inside. I\u2019ll meet you in ... five minutes.\u201d He could take care of himself in that short amount of time.</p><p>Both women snorted.</p><p>\u201cHardly,\u201d Noelle said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got business.\u201d</p><p>Yes. A long night.</p><p>As Ava scooted passed him, she commanded the door to open. The latch separated from the vehicle and she moved the rest of the way out, practically knocking Noelle to her ass.</p><p>\u201cThis is your fault, McKell,\u201d she snapped over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cMy fault?\u201d He scooted out, too, and unfolded to a stand. \u201cHow is it my fault?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour tree theory sucks!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTree theory?\u201d Noelle switched her attention from Ava to McKell, McKell to Ava. \u201cColor me intrigued.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d they shouted in unison.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She held up her hands. \u201cBe that way. I\u2019ll just get the prisoners.\u201d</p><p>McKell held out his arm, stopping her from approaching the backseat. \u201cNo! Don\u2019t touch them.\u201d</p><p>Far from intimidated, she anchored her hands on her hips. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, why not?\u201d Ava demanded.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>Noelle\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou\u2019re seriously so possessive you can\u2019t even allow someone to touch your prisoners?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say a word, just crossed his arms over his chest.</p><p>\u201cWow. I\u2019m suddenly unsure why I ever called dibs,\u201d Noelle said with a shake of her head. \u201cThank God I changed my mind and gave him to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so lucky to be single,\u201d Ava said, and damn if she didn\u2019t sound truly envious.</p><p>His gaze narrowed on her, but he spoke to the car. \u201cOpen.\u201d Like the front door, the back expanded. He reached inside and grabbed one of the vampires, anchoring the bastard over his shoulder. Then he bent to grab the other one. Only, the one he held slammed into the top of the car. He straightened, bent again. Same thing happened.</p><p>\u201cAva,\u201d he said, pivoting to face her. \u201cI will allow you to get the other one.\u201d And he wouldn\u2019t mind, he realized with surprise. He\u2019d always had a problem with sharing, though the inability had grown worse over the last few months.</p><p>When he\u2019d lived below, in the vampire underworld, he\u2019d rarely allowed anyone inside his personal cave. They would have put their hands on his things, and he wanted to cut off the hands that touched his things. With Ava, he actually liked the thought of her hands on the things that belonged to him.</p><p>Maybe not the vampires, he decided then. They were male, and she only needed to put those beautiful hands on him. But everything else, yes.</p><p>\u201cI mean, I\u2019ll allow Noelle to get the other one.\u201d</p><p>Ava stood beside Noelle, and both women watched him. Ava blew on her nails, then buffed them on her shirt. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t dream of touching something that belongs to you. So, yeah. We\u2019ll be in the house, waiting. Take that five minutes if you still want it.\u201d</p><p>With that, both women gave him a pinkie wave and strode past the open iron gate, up the hill, and into the large ... home. Fortress was a better word. Large, sprawling, and dark, with manicured lawns and armed guards patrolling the upper walkway.</p><p>Grumbling under his breath, McKell tossed the vampire he held onto the ground, then reached in and dragged out the other.</p><p>This was definitely going to be a long night.</p><p>Nineteen</p><p>God, McKell was sexy, lugging two full-size male vampires over his shoulders, stomping up the winding staircase in the Tremain mansion, and dumping the bodies on the floor of the \u201cinterrogation\u201d room. All without breaking a sweat or panting. Like he did when he touched her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was pissed off, though. That much was clear. His violet eyes were stormy, and his lips were turned down in a fierce scowl. That just made him sexier, Ava thought. And she\u2019d had all that sexiness on top of her. Just a few minutes ago, at that.</p><p>He\u2019d kissed her with abandon. He\u2019d tasted of butterscotch, as if he\u2019d sucked on several candies before sucking on her. His hands had moved over her with utter possession, teasing and taunting and demanding a response. Without a doubt, he\u2019d owned her. Whatever he\u2019d wanted, she would have done. Would have begged to do.</p><p>She shivered, remembering.</p> <p>His long, thick fingers had sunk inside her, and she\u2019d felt penetrated to her soul. Writhing against him had been her only option. Stopping would have killed her. Had they been anywhere but a car, two guys in the backseat, she would have demanded he fuck her. Hard, possibly forever. Shocking.</p><p>Forever still wasn\u2019t for her. But God, she\u2019d wanted him. Even after he\u2019d given her the most intense orgasm of her life, she\u2019d wanted more of him. Wanted more even though he\u2019d made her work for that orgasm, following his naughty fingers, silently pleading for contact.</p><p>She\u2019d hoped to do the same to him. Torment him before finally allowing him release. Only, they\u2019d reached their destination first, and she was still peeved about that. Not embarrassed at having been caught by her friend, as she should have been, but upset that she hadn\u2019t gotten to finish him.</p><p>Now, McKell\u2014Victor\u2014was probably in pain. Surely cursing her name. He\u2019d shown her paradise, and she\u2019d shown him hell. That was what embarrassed her most. Like she was an incompetent. Like she couldn\u2019t pull her sexual weight.</p><p>Just then, his gaze lifted, found Ava, darkened\u2014she shivered again, knowing the passion that still lurked inside him, hungry, unsated, waiting\u2014and then swiftly moved away, scanning the entire room in less than a heartbeat.</p> <p>What did he think of the teardrop chandelier? The tiny angels painted on the walls? The beaded pillows, the precious china locked in intricate hutches?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m to question them here?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Noelle frowned. \u201cApparently the torture chamber has become the new storage closet. This is our fourth dining room, unnecessary, and will have to do. So what\u2019s wrong with it, anyway? Looks perfect to me.\u201d</p><p>He pointed to the plush white carpet. \u201cBlood is red. Soon the rug will be, too.\u201d</p><p>As if hearing and understanding his meaning, both unconscious vampires moaned.</p><p>Fangs peeking out from his top lip, McKell then pointed to the two chairs Noelle had pushed together. \u201cAnd those ... those just look comfy.\u201d</p> <p>True. Both had cobalt velvet cushions at the back and rear, and swirling flowers had been carved into the wood. Real wood, with a glossy maple finish. They were gorgeous. What a shame to ruin them. But Noelle had never cared about family heirlooms like those probably were.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t have the stomach for torturing, just say so and get out,\u201d Noelle said. \u201cDon\u2019t blame the furniture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot have the stomach for torturing?\u201d His color deepened with fury. \u201cJust watch and learn, little girl.\u201d After he threw the vampires into the chairs and tied them down, he slapped them into wakefulness.</p><p>They blinked open their eyes, revealing glazed, glassy irises. Ava fell into the couch that had been moved in front of the chairs, and Noelle plopped beside her. Would it have been bad to ring a servant for popcorn?</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d they do to deserve this, anyway?\u201d her friend asked. \u201cKill someone you love? Burn your apartment down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. They just have information about successful vampire living.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose bastards! Wait.\u201d Noelle\u2019s features scrunched in confusion. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMcKell doesn\u2019t know how to live in the sunlight, and they might.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSuggestion,\u201d Noelle said, raising her hand like a schoolgirl. \u201cIt\u2019s called sunblock, and it\u2019s sold at any local grocery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe chatter can end anytime,\u201d McKell snapped without looking at them.</p><p>Noelle rolled her eyes, and Ava drummed her fingers against the armrest. Both vampires had been watching and listening to the byplay, she realized, forgetting McKell entirely. Otherwise they would have been screaming. Still.</p><p>\u201cShe makes a good point,\u201d Ava said.</p><p>\u201cAva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, have you tried it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWoman.\u201d He whipped around and finally faced her. \u201cI didn\u2019t interrupt your work at the bar. Please don\u2019t interrupt mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she muttered. Torturing was his job? Why did that add to his already off-the-charts sex appeal? \u201cI won\u2019t say another word.\u201d She even pretended to twist a lock over her lips and toss the key aside.</p><p>He nodded and returned his attention to the men. Before he even said another word, their expressions became mulish.</p><p>\u201cI know who you are,\u201d one said, \u201cand I know what you can do. But I\u2019m not telling you shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, either,\u201d the other agreed.</p><p>McKell flicked her an irritated glance, as if their refusal was her fault. Like she\u2019d ruined his street cred or something. She blinked innocently.</p><p>\u201cMy God,\u201d Noelle gasped. \u201cThat voice ... it washes over you, consumes you. Mama wants a taste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConcentrate on McKell, not\u2014\u201d What were their names? \u201cNot them.\u201d She\u2019d just call them One and Two. \u201cThat\u2019s what I do.\u201d Wait. She didn\u2019t like the thought of Noelle relying on McKell. For anything, even this. \u201cConcentrate on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp us,\u201d One began, gaze locked on Noelle. There were flickers of light in that onyx gaze, stars in a silken sky. \u201cYou have only to\u2014\u201d</p><p>McKell punched him so hard Ava thought she heard the guy\u2019s brain rattle against his skull. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you, but I will if you force me. Here\u2019s rule number one. You will focus on me, and only me. Speak to the women again, and I\u2019ll cut out your eyes.\u201d</p><p>Both vampires trembled, nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m concentrating on you, but I still want to help him,\u201d Noelle whispered to her.</p><p>Ava squeezed her knee, ready to fight her if she tried to stand.</p><p>\u201cNow, then.\u201d McKell rubbed his hands together. \u201cI want answers, that\u2019s all, and answers are easy enough to give, yes?\u201d They trembled under his scrutiny. \u201cSo let\u2019s begin. You\u2019ve been here two years. Your skin is smooth, unburned, and you seem to have money.\u201d</p><p>True. They were clean, their clothing unsoiled, a soft leather, and their hair had just the right amount of product. \u201cMaybe they steal,\u201d Ava suggested.</p><p>\u201cAva!\u201d This time McKell didn\u2019t face her, but his voice still wrapped around her, tightening, becoming a vise grip. \u201cI thought your mouth was sealed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she muttered, shoulders sagging.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we steal,\u201d One said mockingly.</p><p>Two nodded with a smug grin.</p><p>Ava was surprised McKell didn\u2019t start hitting again. And wow, she really was undermining him. She\u2019d spoken, and the vampires had lost their fear.</p><p>\u201cDo you go out in the daylight?\u201d The words sounded as if they\u2019d been pushed through a meat grinder, rather than McKell\u2019s throat.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Two said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying,\u201d McKell replied.</p><p>One lifted his chin. \u201cProve it.\u201d</p><p>McKell shrugged. \u201cThat, I can do. We can wait until morning, and I can toss you outside, tie you down, let you stay there. For hours. Maybe you\u2019ll burn, maybe you won\u2019t. Either way, I\u2019ll know the truth.\u201d</p><p>Both vampires paled. At the thought of being burned? Or at the thought of proving beyond a doubt that they\u2019d learned how to endure the sun\u2019s rays? She frowned, mind buzzing. Why would they care about the latter?</p><p>\u201cYou found us in a nightclub. At ... what? Night.\u201d One\u2019s eyes narrowed, though he couldn\u2019t quite conceal his defiance. \u201cAnyone with sense would realize we\u2019re telling the truth and can\u2019t go out in daylight.\u201d</p><p>Anyone with sense? A spark of anger bloomed in Ava\u2019s chest. McKell had been nothing but patient. Kind of. Yet One had the nerve to call her man senseless? She pushed to her feet before she realized what she was doing, withdrew a blade from the holster around her waist, and marched over to vampires.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help herself. She stabbed One in the leg.</p><p>He howled.</p><p>McKell looked at her, and she thought she saw a spark of pride in those purple specks. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said, surprising her.</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Noelle clapped. \u201cI give you an eight-point-nine for form. Had to deduct for faulty finish. You didn\u2019t twist the hilt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if you could have done any better,\u201d McKell told her without looking away from Ava.</p><p>Ava rose on her tiptoes and placed a swift, hard kiss on McKell\u2019s lips. He\u2019d defended her skill, the delightful man. Even if she had forgotten to twist the hilt like any decent agent would have done. He was grinning as she returned to the couch.</p><p>When One\u2019s howling finally ceased, tears streaming down his face, McKell said, \u201cSo. I\u2019ll ask again. Do you have any trouble in the sunlight? And before you answer, you should know that I\u2019ve heard rumors. Everyone in the underground has. It can be done.\u201d</p><p>One gulped.</p><p>McKell continued, \u201cDo you think I immediately killed every vampire I hunted and found living here? No. I returned them to the caves and ... chatted with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime out,\u201d Noelle said, hands forming a cross. \u201cIf you chatted, why don\u2019t you already know the answer?\u201d</p><p>Good question. Ava imagined he was very good at chatting.</p><p>He sighed, as if he\u2019d already resigned himself to more interruptions. \u201cEverything I was told, I\u2019ve tried. None of it has worked. Which means I was lied to. And it\u2019s too late to get the truth from the liars.\u201d</p><p>Because he\u2019d killed them. Nice.</p><p>\u201cThat might be why I\u2019m especially vengeful when lied to now,\u201d he finished, pointed gaze on the vampires.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re ... we\u2019re not telling you what we know,\u201d Two rushed out, pallid now. \u201cWe can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you think to keep the truth from me because I was once the enforcer of vampire laws, think again. Those laws no longer apply. I\u2019m as much an outlaw as you. Tell me, and live.\u201d McKell withdrew the blade from One\u2019s leg and thrust it into Two\u2019s. More howling ensued. \u201cDon\u2019t, and die.\u201d He twisted the hilt, and the howling became pleading.</p><p>McKell glanced back at Ava. To ensure she watched? She nodded her approval.</p><p>\u201cNine-point-nine,\u201d Noelle said.</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWhy was I deducted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou waited too long to do the twisting.\u201d</p><p>His frown deepened, but he gave no reply. Ava was surprised, though, that he wasn\u2019t chastising Noelle for such an \u201chonest\u201d critique. Most men would have. They would have thought the girl was insensitive or crazy. Yes, she\u2019d heard both descriptions before. Many times. And Ava had put the ones who\u2019d said so in the hospital.</p><p>But McKell\u2014for the most part\u2014just went along with them, as if what they did and said was normal. And that ... delighted her. Seriously? It delights you? Now she was the one frowning. She wasn\u2019t supposed to like him more with every minute that passed. She was supposed to be growing tired of him. Like she had with every other man in her life. Before they could grow tired of her.</p><p>McKell faced the vampires. \u201cStop blubbering. You\u2019re an embarrassment to our kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that ... that hurts,\u201d Two sniffed.</p><p>\u201cWhich you can blame on yourself. I gave you a choice, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>More blubbering, more sniffing, and Ava shook her head. McKell was right. That was embarrassing for all vampirekind.</p><p>With a swift jerk, McKell withdrew the knife. As predicted, blood dripped onto the carpet. \u201cLet\u2019s try this one more time. How do you\u2014\u201d</p><p>There was a knock on the door, distracting him. He glanced at Ava. She shrugged, a don\u2019t-look-at-me gesture. She and Noelle had done much worse than a little torturing over the years, so everyone here kind of expected such behavior.</p><p>Noelle sat up ramrod-straight and growled. \u201cJust a sec,\u201d she called to the intruder. Then, to those in the room, \u201cI told everyone to stay away, but clearly someone didn\u2019t listen and needs to be fired.\u201d</p><p>Another knock.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Noelle shouted.</p><p>No one replied, but the metal door did slide open. Mrs. Tremain, the ironfisted matriarch of the wealthiest family in New Chicago, marched inside on a cloud of expensive perfume. \u201cWhat is going on in here? Who is screaming?\u201d</p><p>As always, her expression was stern. No telling what kind of treatments she did to her face, but it was unlined despite her fifty-something years. She wore a starched button-up shirt and a pencil skirt. She was thin. Too thin. And when she spied the bleeding vampires, she merely arched a barely-there brow.</p><p>Her gaze narrowed on McKell, who still clutched the dripping knife. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother,\u201d Noelle said, exasperated. \u201cWe\u2019re kinda busy here. Come back later.\u201d</p><p>Mother Tremain straightened her spine as though she\u2019d been slapped. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she demanded again. \u201cWho is that man? Are we being robbed?\u201d</p><p>Ava despised the way she annunciated the beginning of each new sentence.</p><p>\u201cHelp us,\u201d One suddenly begged.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Two pleaded.</p><p>Mrs. Tremain\u2019s gray eyes glazed over, and she took a step forward. \u201cYes. Yes, I\u2019ll help you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nice to know even disapproving matrons weren\u2019t immune to vampire wiles. Ava popped to her feet and waved a hand in front of the woman\u2019s face. Distraction was the only thing that helped. \u201cHey, Mrs. Tremain. Nice to see you again. Long time, huh?\u201d</p><p>The glaze faded, replaced by disdain, and the old woman\u2019s chin lifted. \u201cAva Sans. I should have known.\u201d So much disapproval rested in that tone. \u201cNoelle has always liked bringing home the trash, rather than leaving it at the curb where it belongs.\u201d</p><p>McKell strode toward her, bless his heart, as if he meant to defend Ava\u2019s honor. For the first time in Ava\u2019s memory, something managed to intimidate the staunch matron, truly intimidate her, and Mrs. Tremain backed up a step as two hundred and fifty pounds of enraged vampire bore down on her.</p> <p>\u201cMcKell,\u201d Ava said, and he instantly stopped, surprising her. \u201cYou can\u2019t kill her. Or believe me, she\u2019d already be dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I hurt her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ava said at the same time Noelle said, \u201cYes. Mother, I told you what would happen if you ever insulted my friend again. I\u2019d marry a bum right off the street. I swear to God I was telling the truth.\u201d</p><p>The matriarch kept her attention on McKell. \u201cAs if you have the courage to\u2014\u201d She squeaked as he started back up.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t,\u201d Ava added. For McKell\u2019s benefit. She didn\u2019t want him in trouble with the law.</p> <p>Again, he stopped. \u201cVery well.\u201d</p><p>No question, he was getting a reward when they got home. Home. Their home. Just for a little while, but still theirs. A bolt of awareness traveled through her, lightning to her nerve endings.</p><p>Where had her fight gone? Her resistance?</p><p>Noelle hurtled a pillow at the woman who had always considered Ava beneath every member of her family. \u201cMother, I told you I had important business up here. Now get out before I tie you to a chair.\u201d</p><p>That chin lifted yet another notch. \u201cFine.\u201d She turned to leave, throwing over her shoulder, \u201cBut you will clean this room when you\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both know that\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d Noelle returned. \u201cAnd tell Cook to fire up the grill. I\u2019m in the mood for a steak.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd maybe butterscotch cookies,\u201d Ava suggested. \u201cTell her she used too much nutmeg last time, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>The door closed with a snap, and there was a moment of charged silence.</p><p>\u201cThis is the best day of my life,\u201d Noelle said with a grin that lit her entire face. \u201cMy mother yelped. Did you guys hear it, or was I just dreaming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard,\u201d One said through his tears. \u201cAnd I\u2019m only speaking to McKell.\u201d</p><p>Ava reclaimed her spot on the couch. \u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>McKell used both hands to wipe his face, as if the motion could also wipe away the memory of Mrs. Tremain\u2019s distraction. He returned to the vampires. \u201cYou were just telling me how to survive in the sun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we weren\u2019t.\u201d One shook his head violently.</p><p>\u201cNot even if you stab us again. But please don\u2019t stab us again.\u201d</p> <p>McKell lifted his leg and rested his foot on One\u2019s injured thigh. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be so sure about that. But, lucky for you, I\u2019m willing to negotiate. Tell me what I want to know, and the women will kiss. Each other.\u201d</p><p>Both men blinked, looked at each other, looked at Ava and Noelle. One lost his glaze of pain, and Two licked his lips.</p><p>\u201cThey have to kiss first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then we\u2019ll tell you everything we know. Promise.\u201d</p><p>McKell removed his foot and faced Ava, then motioned with his hand. She just blinked at him.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d he prompted. \u201cGet started. Kiss.\u201d</p><p>She planned to reward him, not everyone in the room. \u201cFirst, this is your interrogation. We\u2019re just here to watch, listen and learn. Remember?\u201d</p><p>He pursed his lips. \u201cAva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSecond,\u201d she continued, \u201cyou\u2019re caving to their demands? Well, I won\u2019t allow it. Either they spill the secret, or there\u2019s no kissing. And I won\u2019t budge on this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Noelle said with a nod. \u201cWe won\u2019t budge on this. No matter how sexy their voices are.\u201d She gave the vampires a pinkie wave. \u201cAnd no matter how bad I want to get my tongue into my little firecracker\u2019s mouth.\u201d</p><p>One nodded in invitation, and Two wiggled his brows.</p><p>McKell splayed his arms, as if he were powerless. \u201cYou heard the females. Answers first, kiss second.\u201d</p><p>One and Two faced each other, whispering, debating. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t tell him, even for that kiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll find out eventually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but he\u2019ll kill us just as soon as we tell him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019ll kill us if we don\u2019t. He said so, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut when he knows, he\u2019ll make it painful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRumor is, he\u2019s been kicked out of the underground. Maybe he won\u2019t care. He hates humans, and didn\u2019t he say that he no longer enforces vampire law?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas anyone ever told you that you\u2019re stupid? He could be lying. The woman he kissed is a human, so he can\u2019t hate them too badly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the stupid one.\u201d</p><p>Did she and Noelle sound that dumb when they argued? Geez! She\u2019d had enough, was getting upset that McKell wasn\u2019t getting what he wanted, and was close to stabbing someone again. \u201cOffer ends in five ... four ... three ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d One rushed out. \u201cI\u2019ll tell.\u201d Deep breath in, hold ... hold, slow release. \u201cIf you drain a human to death, once every night, you develop a resistance to the sun\u2019s deathly rays. But you have to kill every night, because the effects only last twelve hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the only way?\u201d McKell asked.</p><p>That\u2019s all he cared about? The guy had just admitted to murdering someone every night. Stab someone? No, she had a target, and a simple stabbing wasn\u2019t violent enough.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d was the eager answer. \u201cNow about that kiss ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s all you have to do?\u201d McKell asked now.</p><p>That\u2019s all?</p><p>Another eager, \u201cYes. So back to the kiss ...\u201d</p><p>Those bastards! All of them. McKell included.</p><p>He twirled the blade he still held. \u201cI\u2019m not done yet. Most other vampires living on the surface world know this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they don\u2019t, they learn pretty quickly.\u201d One\u2019s gaze swung to Ava and Noelle. \u201cIs that all, because\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they willingly do it?\u201d McKell asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Two\u2019s irritation was showing, but he hurried on. \u201cHumans are merely food, after all. And I know, I know. Humans are our food, and we\u2019ve always been forbidden from killing our food because the supply could run out. But listen, we don\u2019t do that. That\u2019s why we were out tonight. We stopped killing. Trying to blend in during the day was a waste of time. We thought to get jobs, you know. Real jobs. Be productive. But why work when you can simply convince people to give you what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for being truthful,\u201d McKell said.</p><p>If he told her to kiss Noelle now, Ava really would grab another knife and sink it\u2014</p><p>\u201cBy the way. I lied. There\u2019ll be no kiss.\u201d With one fluid slash, he cut One\u2019s throat, then Two\u2019s. Both gurgled in pain and shock, bled, color fading, bodies twitching ... passed out. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. They\u2019ll recover.\u201d He tossed the knife on the floor. \u201cBut for their crimes, they are my gift to AIR. Your people may do whatever they like with them.\u201d</p><p>Ava relaxed against the couch. Bless his sweet little heart. He\u2019d just earned himself another reward.</p><p>Twenty</p><p>McKell wasn\u2019t surprised when Ava and Noelle left him alone with the unconscious vampires. To \u201cship his property to AIR on his own, as he most likely wanted to do, possessive ass that he was.\u201d What had surprised him? They\u2019d expected a thank-you for their consideration. Aka a back rub, followed by a foot rub, followed by hand-feeding them dinner. Before taking off to \u201cdo shit he shouldn\u2019t concern himself with,\u201d they\u2019d been very vocal about their desires.</p><p>Females. He\u2019d let them go only because they\u2019d sworn to remain inside the house.</p><p>So, alone in the dining room, McKell surveyed his handiwork. The vampires were unmoving\u2014and messy\u2014and there was no way in hell he was going to spend the next hour patching them up for safe travels to their new home, while the girls did God knew what. Only one way to handle this, then. He delegated their care to the two guards waiting outside the door, ordering the men to bind those slashed necks and drive the vampires straight to AIR headquarters, making no stops along the way.</p><p>They nodded and jumped into action\u2014after admitting that Ava had already commanded them to do exactly that.</p><p>Females, he thought again. Only this time he was grinning. His woman was clever.</p><p>Now he surveyed the room itself. Ruined, as he\u2019d first warned Noelle. But she hadn\u2019t seemed to care about the possibility and subsequent reality, so he wouldn\u2019t either. Besides, he well knew how possessive some people could be about their things, cough cough, and he didn\u2019t want to upset Noelle\u2019s harpy of a mother by moping up a single drop of blood and touching what now belonged to her.</p><p>So he left the room exactly as it was with a muttered, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d See how nice he was? He wasn\u2019t even going to demand a thank-you of his own.</p><p>He strode down the hall, following Ava\u2019s scent, but stopped midway as a thought struck him. Scent. He was following her scent. Her human scent.</p><p>The vampires\u2019 scent ... He\u2019d never noticed one.</p><p>Frowning, McKell backtracked to the bloody room. In the club, he\u2019d recognized their faces, so had known what they were, but had assumed they were scentless because of the many humans that surrounded them. Plus, he\u2019d been worked into a cold, dark frenzy because one of them had practically embraced Ava.</p><p>In the car, he\u2019d been too wrapped up in kissing Ava to care or consider. During the interrogation, he\u2019d been too wrapped up in impressing Ava to care or consider. But now that she\u2019d left, now that their blood was spilled all over the floor, he realized they still didn\u2019t smell like vampires.</p><p>They smelled human, and that human scent was stamped inside his nose. A consequence of draining humans to death?</p><p>Maybe. But they\u2019d claimed to have stopped. That begged the question: How long ago had they stopped? Yesterday? The day before? A year? And since they smelled human, would they heal like a vampire or die from their wounds?</p><p>They deserved the latter, so he still couldn\u2019t regret his actions.</p><p>Killing their food supply went against every vampire rule in existence. McKell might view the humans as beneath him\u2014well, most of them\u2014but he would never do such a thing. Not even to walk unfettered in the daylight.</p><p>No wonder the vampires he\u2019d hunted and tortured for leaving the underground had taken their secrets to the grave. Like these two, they\u2019d known he would have made their deaths ten thousands times more painful if he\u2019d known.</p><p>He left the room a second time, certain there had to be another way to impede the sun\u2019s harmful rays. Equally certain Ava would help him find it. He had only to uncover her whereabouts, take her home, make love, feed, make love again, and put her immense brainpower to use. He picked up his pace.</p><p>Like the rest of her world, this home was too open for his tastes. Too spacious. He needed walls at his sides, closing him in. Like his cave. Perhaps one day he\u2019d take Ava there. Make love to her there.</p><p>Again he quickened his steps. Left, right, right, left. Up another staircase. Down one. Through a kitchen. Every servant and guard he\u2019d seen on the way in was now gone. Where was Ava? If she\u2019d left ... He frowned as a morbid thought occurred to him. Had he frightened her? Had she lied and run from him?</p><p>She\u2019d seen him nearly kill two men, yes, but she\u2019d already known he was a killer. A killer who always acted without hesitation. Well, only once had he hesitated, but Bride didn\u2019t count, since they\u2019d already been betrothed and he\u2019d considered her to be his exclusive property.</p><p>His head tilted to the side as he pondered his willingness to later let Bride leave with Devyn the Targon. A willingness Ava would not receive. The thought of her walking away from him permanently, and for another man at that, filled him with so much rage he could have clawed every piece of furniture to shreds and returned the walls to plaster and dust. But he wouldn\u2019t hurt her, he thought with conviction. Even then, even lost to the red haze of fury, he would be unable to hurt her. She was ... precious.</p><p>She made him laugh, something no one had ever done before. She understood him, helped him. Drove him to be better. He hadn\u2019t killed those vampires, and he hadn\u2019t made them beg and suffer for hours. See? An utter improvement.</p><p>So, what did she think about him? Now that she\u2019d seen his violent, yet merciful side?</p><p>He would ask her, and she would tell him the truth. She always did. No matter how deeply the truth cut. That was something else he liked about her. Her honesty. And after she told him that she still craved him\u2014she hadn\u2019t run, she just hadn\u2019t\u2014they could return home and, what? Make love. His shaft was still hard, still aching.</p><p>Where was she? Where was anyone? The servants and guards had probably left with the old crone. Perhaps she\u2019d wanted no witnesses for her daughter\u2019s deeds. That implied caring, though, and the crone hadn\u2019t seemed to care about anything but hating Ava.</p><p>He should have killed her, he thought. He\u2019d wanted to. How dare she look at Ava as beneath her? No one was better than Ava. She could rule this planet if she wished. She was the best of the best. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Where you are, sweetness? Her scent led him to a music room. There was a piano, a harp, drums and several guitars, but no Ava. He sniffed. The crone had been here recently, as well.</p><p>His frown deepened. He didn\u2019t like the thought of Ava wandering around without his protection. No matter how skilled she was. The hag could have paid a group of men to attack her. If so, heads would roll.</p><p>McKell had never been a discriminating killer. Whoever the king had ordered him to kill, he had killed. Male, female, young, old, it hadn\u2019t mattered. Rebels and deserters were rebels and deserters, no matter their sex or age. But this time the kills would be personal. He\u2019d enjoy them.</p> <p>\u201cAva,\u201d he called.</p><p>No reply.</p><p>A quick stride through the chamber, and he caught Ava\u2019s butterscotch scent again. Good. But, no. Impossible. She couldn\u2019t have gone through the far wall. Unless ... He knocked on said wall until he heard the hollow echo of a hidden doorway. Ah. Of course. Such a clever girl. And as he\u2019d known, she hadn\u2019t run from him.</p><p>His fingers brushed gently, searching and finding a telling seam. Naughty vixen, trying to do something in secret. Not that he\u2019d let her get away with it. He straightened and considered his options. With hidden passages, there was always a latch, but discovering that latch would take time. Time required patience. Patience he didn\u2019t have.</p><p>He clawed an opening in the wall, plaster falling away in chunks, dust plumping around him. When the void was a little wider than his body, he slipped through. Female voices echoed. Finally.</p> <p>Grinning, McKell descended a well-lit staircase, turned a corner, and found another open doorway that led into ... another room. With an arsenal. Guns and knives hung from the walls, and there were actual shelves piled high with grenades, throwing stars, and all kinds of other things he couldn\u2019t name.</p><p>Ava and Noelle were talking and laughing as they suited up, probably adding one hundred pounds of death to their bodies. A ... what was that? His lips curled in distaste. Was that what humans referred to as a dog? Yes, that sounded correct. Dogs had nearly been wiped out during the human-alien war, and most people had robotic imitations now.</p><p>This one appeared real as it perched between the women, eyes darting back and forth between them. It had ratty dark brown fur, a large pink tongue that stuck out with drool dripping from it, and a long tail that wagged. And wagged and wagged and wagged.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>The dog jumped excitedly, then trotted to him and wound around his legs. He grimaced. Neither of the women acted surprised to see him. They just kept checking pyre-crystals.</p><p>\u201cGot a text from Mia,\u201d Ava said. She\u2019d changed into jeans and a T-shirt. \u201cThe Sch\u00f6n queen cornered Dallas again, and now he\u2019s in the hospital.\u201d</p> <p>McKell tried to shoo the animal away. \u201cIs he infected?\u201d It remained at his side, fur softer than he\u2019d realized, but still. Annoying.</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d Noelle replied. \u201cFriendly fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you plan to...?\u201d He glanced between them. The dog used his inattention to its advantage, licking his palm. He couldn\u2019t help his yelp of disgust. \u201cDon\u2019t do that again, or I\u2019ll gut you.\u201d</p><p>Rather than racing away in terror, the dog gazed up at him with big, brown eyes.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Hellina. Hell for short,\u201d Noelle said, motioning to the dog with a tilt of her chin.</p><p>The ugly thing was female?</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019re going out to kill vampires,\u201d Ava said, as if it were obvious.</p><p>His brow furrowed. He was having trouble connecting the dots. \u201cWhat does one\u2014Dallas\u2019s injury\u2014have to do with the other\u2014vampire hunting?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said, shoving a thick, curved blade in the sheath now hanging at her side. \u201cBoth piss me off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Was he to be one of her victims? Would she now try to wash her hands of him? Try to kick him out of her apartment? \u201cAre the actions of my people a deal breaker, then?\u201d Translation: Would he have to seduce her into liking him again?</p><p>Such a dirty, dirty job.</p><p>Noelle laughed, and Ava\u2019s cheeks reddened. \u201cNo,\u201d Ava said. \u201cAIR needs you.\u201d</p><p>What of you? he almost asked, but didn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t want an audience for that particular conversation.</p><p>Hellina rubbed against him, demanding his attention. Not knowing what else to do, he reached down and scratched behind her ears. She closed her eyes, as if she\u2019d never experienced so expert a touch. Which, of course, she hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna stay here, because, as you\u2019ve proven, all the vampires run away from you,\u201d she continued. \u201cPlus, dawn will arrive soon, and unless you want to drain me completely, you can\u2019t survive out there. There are a thousand other reasons but we\u2019ll leave them at blah, blah, blah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, you can\u2019t handle vampires on your own, Ava.\u201d What would have happened to her at the club if he hadn\u2019t saved her? The thought of her facing defeat again, without him, perhaps with stronger vampires than the ones they\u2019d captured, caused his blood to churn into acid, blistering his veins. \u201cSecond, like you said, dawn will come all too soon. How will you know where to look for vampires?\u201d He\u2019d given her no pointers, no starting point. \u201cHuman clubs will be closed, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but here\u2019s the thing.\u201d She lifted a bone dagger and pricked her finger on the tip. His mouth watered at the sight of that crimson bead. \u201cThe vampires walking around in daylight are the ones I want. As a bonus, I\u2019m sure AIR would love to use them as pincushions to test against the Sch\u00f6n virus. They\u2019ll deserve it, too.\u201d She rubbed the bead on her jeans.</p><p>No argument from him. \u201cBut how will you find them?\u201d he asked again. This time, the words were slurred. Don\u2019t let the hunger overtake you. Not yet. He had to make her understand the trouble she was courting.</p><p>\u201cWhen I\u2019m done, I\u2019m taking you in to see Mia,\u201d she said, ignoring his question completely. \u201cI kept my end of our bargain, so now you have to keep yours and talk to her.\u201d</p><p>So. She didn\u2019t mean to try to exterminate him for the actions of his people. Despite his relief, he offered no reply. Not even about her desire to leave him behind. And that\u2019s all it was. A desire he wouldn\u2019t grant. But he would deal with that in a moment. After they\u2019d addressed his consuming disappointment that they wouldn\u2019t be having sex tonight as he\u2019d planned.</p><p>\u201cDid I ever tell you about your blood?\u201d Ava asked before he could command Noelle to cover her ears. She anchored the bone dagger to her wrist, and sucked on the tip of her finger to force the pinprick to close.</p><p>Mine, he thought, jealous that she tasted what he so craved. But all right. This conversation he would allow. Blood was almost as important as sex. He leaned a shoulder against the doorframe, stopped petting the silly dog, and crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d His blood?</p><p>Hellina whined. He ignored her.</p><p>\u201cAnyone who ingests it will be turned into a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpossible.\u201d Despite what her books and movies claimed\u2014which his kind studied, because information was power\u2014vampires couldn\u2019t turn humans. They had tried. Still. This explained her absolute refusal to drink from him, and her threat to kill him dead if he snuck her a single drop. She\u2019d feared being turned.</p><p>Hellina nudged him, but he again ignored her. Never should have touched her in the first place. Now he smelled like her, like wild animal. Disgusting. \u201cWe\u2019re born, not created, I promise you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently, you can create them.\u201d</p><p>He laughed at how little she apparently knew about his kind. Hellina nudged him yet again, and with a sigh, he renewed his petting. Anything to stop the pawing of his pants. \u201cSuch a thing has never been done before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d she insisted. \u201cHave you ever shared your blood with another person? Someone human?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d That didn\u2019t mean ...</p><p>Noelle snorted. \u201cShocker. McKell, being selfish.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her, too. \u201cThere\u2019s one way to prove your claim, Ava. Drink my blood right now.\u201d And sweet heaven, did he adore the thought. More than he\u2019d ever thought possible. He still didn\u2019t think she\u2019d turn into a vampire\u2014silly girl\u2014but they would finally be mated completely, with her willing cooperation.</p><p>She would still age, but he suddenly didn\u2019t care. He would have her for the rest of her life. Enjoy her. Share with her. Those few years would be better than an eternity without her.</p><p>Ava bent down and shoved a pair of barbed-wire cuffs in her boots. \u201cThis may come as a surprise to you, McKell, but I don\u2019t want to be a vampire. Ever. I happen to like being human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might like being vampire more,\u201d he said, offended. Which was foolish. She simply couldn\u2019t be turned. \u201cAnd what does this have to do with anything, huh?\u201d Trying to distract him from his purpose? He wouldn\u2019t put it past her.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking.\u201d She straightened, amber gaze locked on him. Holding him captive. \u201cIf we incarcerate the Sch\u00f6n queen, maybe you could give her some of your blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d No hesitation on his part. If he shared with anyone, it would be Ava. And only Ava. \u201cAnd if I discover what I give to Mia for testing is used for something else, on someone else, I will kill everyone involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what if it doesn\u2019t kill the queen\u2019s disease, but just makes her stronger?\u201d Noelle asked, inserting herself back into the conversation. On his side, no less.</p><p>Ava somehow broke the chains that bound their gazes and faced her friend. \u201cMia and I wondered the same thing, but we can try it out with Johnny tonight, when we escort McKell to AIR headquarters. If Mia says okay, that is. She\u2019s deliberating the pros and cons. I think she\u2019ll decide to go for it, though. It\u2019s not like we have many more options.\u201d</p><p>He loved that the agents had discussed him and his blood at such great length. And made decisions for him. Yeah. Loved. \u201cJust so you know, I\u2019d share my blood with the queen before I shared with Johnny.\u201d Which meant, never ever fucking never. And did no one take his threats seriously anymore?</p><p>Ava snatched up a gun and slammed the clip in place. \u201cMaybe we can bargain.\u201d</p><p>He straightened, once again pulling away from the dog. This time, the beast growled at him. \u201cYou won\u2019t order me around,\u201d he snarled down at her. He had some bargaining to do, followed by some sealing of that bargain.</p><p>Hellina ducked her head and whimpered. McKell\u2019s shoulder\u2019s slumped as he reached out to pet her again. Stupid dog. \u201cI\u2019m listening,\u201d he said to Ava. \u201cYou mentioned a bargain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>What he knew: he\u2019d only allow her to \u201cconvince\u201d him to part with one drop of blood. For that drop, she had to kiss him. But he got to pick where that kiss would be located. \u201cBegin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll start with my terms.\u201d She aimed the pyre-gun at him and fired before he could yell, move, or even stop time. \u201cOops. My bad. We\u2019ll have to finish this conversation later.\u201d</p><p>Blue, he realized with dread. Which meant she\u2019d just stunned him. Again. Fury vapor-locked his lungs, and for several seconds, he couldn\u2019t breathe. When she closed the distance between them and pressed a swift kiss to his lips\u2014not the kiss he\u2019d wanted\u2014his airway opened back up, allowing him to inhale deeply, sucking in that butterscotch scent. Savoring, hating.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I couldn\u2019t let you stop me, and I couldn\u2019t take you with me. Be a good boy,\u201d she said with an edge of repentance. \u201cStun will wear off in twenty-four hours, but I\u2019ll be done in ...\u201d She glanced at Noelle. \u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix and a half hours until the meeting with Mia,\u201d the girl said, hurriedly shoving a few more blades in the holster around her waist.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be done in six hours and return for you. Noelle will help me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe servants,\u201d Noelle interjected.</p><p>Ava rolled her eyes. \u201cNoelle\u2019s servants will help me get you into the car and to AIR without a single burn. See, Ava has it all worked out.\u201d She patted his cheek.</p><p>He snarled.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you two go getting all sappy on me. My gag reflex is high today.\u201d Noelle pressed a series of buttons on the pad on the wall, and all the shelves of weapons began sliding back, disappearing behind another wall.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t be mad, and don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll stun them before we ever have to fight them,\u201d Ava said before strolling off, Noelle on her heels.</p><p>Noelle called over her shoulder, \u201cGuard him, Hell. No one enters the room. Not even Grandma.\u201d</p><p>Hellina growled, and McKell assumed it was the word Grandma that pissed her off, because she remained at his feet, rubbing against him.</p><p>He could have stopped Ava from leaving. Could have frozen her in place, and she had to know that. He\u2019d done it before. But he didn\u2019t do it this time. He let her go, his jaw clenched tight, already aching. Not worry? When she was a walking arsenal?</p><p>There was another way to handle this.</p><p>He stopped time for everyone, excluding himself. So for him, the minutes stretched into hours, endless, wrenching. And every time he lost his mental hold on the clock, he rested for several minutes, then grabbed the reins again.</p><p>Before, he\u2019d only done this during battle, stopping and starting repeatedly, but back then, he\u2019d only needed a few minutes to pass for himself, enough time to destroy his enemy, not twenty-four hours of inactivity. Of waiting. But this was a battle, he supposed. And by the end, only a few hours had passed for everyone else, but the entire day had passed for him, stun gradually wearing off. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Only once did someone try to enter the room. His back was to the door, so he couldn\u2019t see who it was, but the scent was unfamiliar, so he assumed it was a servant. Hellina growled as if she meant to kill, and the person squeaked and ran, footsteps pattering.</p><p>Finally McKell could move. He worked his jaw, squeezed his fingers, arched his back, allowing his muscles to stretch. Every burn, every strain, tossed his fury to a higher level. He was fatigued, but that wasn\u2019t going to detour him.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d he said to the dog, and she happily followed. As he\u2019d suspected, the servants had returned, but no one tried to delay him. Not even when he stole a blanket from one of the bedrooms and draped himself with the material to protect his skin from the sun.</p> <p>He compelled one of those servants into escorting him and Hellina to Ava\u2019s apartment. On the way inside the building, he saw a glittery expanse of air opening up, and he skidded to a halt. Again? Really? When would it learn?</p><p>Come. Please.</p><p>Why so persistent? \u201cI don\u2019t have time for this,\u201d he muttered, trudging back into motion and side-stepping the stupid thing. Once ensconced in the apartment, unburned yet harried, he cut his wrist and let the blood drip into an empty bowl. Only a little, a few drops at most. Then he dug inside Ava\u2019s refrigerator and pulled out a tub of ... yogurt. Did dogs like yogurt? He mixed the creamy concoction with his blood and set the bowl on the ground.</p><p>\u201cEat. It\u2019s experiment time,\u201d he said, and Hellina gobbled up every bite. Dogs liked.</p><p>He waited, watching her intently. She didn\u2019t change. Didn\u2019t suddenly grow fangs. Just kept staring up at him, wagging her tail, begging for more. So. Ava was wrong. Just as he\u2019d supposed.</p> <p>She\u2019d find out she\u2019d been wrong about other things, too.</p><p>\u201cStay here,\u201d he ordered, and then stalked to the bedroom to sift through his bag. He withdrew a clean set of clothing, showered, dressed, then pawed through Ava\u2019s weapon\u2019s closet. Theirs now, he decided, since he lived here. He confiscated a pyre-gun and three blades.</p><p>Ava clearly assumed she could assault him without any repercussions. She assumed she could leave him behind. She assumed she was in charge. It was past time he showed her the error of her ways.</p><p>He stalked out of the apartment with only one backward glance at Hellina, who had followed him to the door. Still no fangs. Didn\u2019t matter. \u201cYou\u2019re mine now,\u201d he told her. Payment for his mistreatment at Noelle\u2019s home.</p><p>She wagged her tail.</p><p>\u201cStay here, and stay quiet. I\u2019ll return shortly.\u201d</p> <p>As he strode down the plain, gray hallway that led to the elevator, a man exited his own apartment. He spied McKell and the weapons strapped all over him, and rushed back inside. Probably to phone the police.</p><p>Wise of him. In McKell\u2019s current dark mood, anything could happen.</p><p>Outside, midday heat caused the air to ripple. And ... the doorway appeared, of course, this time bribing him rather than pleading. If only he would enter, he would find shade, safe travels, a short cut, blah, blah, blah. He told the thing where to stuff itself and motored on.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have sunblock, as Ava had recommended, not that he thought so simple a solution would work, but he did have the blanket. Once again, he draped the material over his head and trudged through the thick crowd on the sidewalk. His body temperature rose unbearably, and sweat began to pour from him.</p><p>Ignoring the discomfort, the stickiness, he breathed deeply, searching for Ava\u2019s scent ... the call of her blood ... An hour passed with no results, and his frustration mounted. So did his irritability. Anyone who got in his way was shoved aside, hard.</p><p>Only one hour of the six remained, then Ava would return to Noelle\u2019s. But he wanted to find her now, proving she couldn\u2019t escape him. Ever. That trying to restrain him was useless.</p><p>A few times, he lost his grip on the blanket and felt blisters well up on his face. Not once did he consider giving up, though, and finally his determination paid off. He caught Ava\u2019s scent.</p><p>Grinning evilly, he followed.</p> <p>Twenty-one</p><p>Vampire hunting was not as rewarding as she\u2019d expected, Ava thought darkly.</p><p>One, they\u2019d most likely killed the night before, the bastards, so they weren\u2019t thirsty while the sun dominated the sky. Meaning, no one stared at her pulse, no one sprouted fangs, and no one tried to mess with her mind.</p><p>Two, McKell was right; she couldn\u2019t scent them.</p><p>Three, after hours of walking around aimlessly, Ava and Noelle pricking fingers on the tips of their knives so that there was always a bead of blood on them, just kind of hoping a vampire would jump from the shadows and attack\u2014something that hadn\u2019t happened in all the years of her life, so why she\u2019d foolishly thought it would happen today of all days she didn\u2019t know\u2014had produced no results.</p><p>It had just given her time to feel guilty about stunning McKell and leaving him behind. Even though it had been for his own good. He would have blistered and weakened, and she needed him in top fighting form for his meeting at AIR. If they tried to hurt him ...</p><p>Her hands fisted. She couldn\u2019t do anything without jeopardizing her job, and she wouldn\u2019t jeopardize her job. She hoped. Where McKell was concerned, she sometimes acted without thought.</p><p>Either way, if they tried to hurt him, she prayed he kicked ass and escaped. He was a nuisance, but a sexy nuisance who was at once selfish and selfless, giving her pleasure without taking any for himself, and besides, his shit was at her place. She didn\u2019t want to have to store it indefinitely. There just wasn\u2019t room.</p><p>At least, that\u2019s the only reason she\u2019d cop to for wanting him eternally safe.</p><p>He probably hated her. Would he ever return to her apartment, even if he escaped AIR? Even if AIR let him go freely, without restriction? Or would he avoid her forevermore?</p><p>She almost turned around and raced back to Noelle\u2019s house. She\u2019d known he would eventually tire of her, but she wasn\u2019t ready to lose him yet.</p><p>\u201cYou listening to me?\u201d Noelle\u2019s voice dragged her from the dark mire of her thoughts.</p><p>Concentrate. \u201cNo. Sorry. What\u2019d you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019re gonna have to switch to Plan B.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she said confidentially, though inside she groaned. The daylight vampires might not be thirsty, but would they be able to resist an open, gushing wound? There was only one way to find out ... a way she\u2019d hoped to avoid. \u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d</p><p>They stopped in the next alleyway they came across. On this side of town, even the alleys were clean. No trash littered the walkway, and no graffiti marred the buildings. Ava leaned against a hot metal wall, upper body falling into the shadows, and held out her arm.</p><p>Noelle remained in the sunlight and withdrew a tiny knife from her cleavage. The bright rays showed hints of uncertainty in her features. \u201cYou sure about being the one to bleed?\u201d</p><p>No. \u201cYeah.\u201d If this worked, no telling how many vamps would chase them\u2014and no telling what kind of abilities those vamps would possess. She needed to be at top strength, but what good was being battle-ready if there was no one to fight? \u201cDo it.\u201d</p><p>The tip of the blade inched closer ... closer ... Noelle\u2019s hand began to shake, and she paused just before contact. \u201cMaybe I should be the one to take the slash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe discussed this earlier and decided it had to be me. Obviously, vampires like the smell of me. Case in point, McKell.\u201d My McKell. Still? \u201cSo it has to be me to drip all over the pavement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I am the better fighter,\u201d Noelle replied in an effort to rally herself. \u201cTherefore, I have to be the one to remain strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d argue the term better fighter, but you\u2019re the one with the knife, so ...\u201d</p><p>They shared a smile, relaxing into their decided roles.</p><p>\u201cMcKell is going to kill me for hurting his property, but that just makes doing this a little bit fun, you know?\u201d With a determined inhalation, Noelle slashed the blade from Ava\u2019s elbow to wrist.</p><p>Ava bit her tongue to keep from grunting. Or screaming. Whatever. Her skin and muscle split open, and crimson blood flowed. \u201cBitch, did you have to go so deep? Damn!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou big baby,\u201d Noelle muttered. \u201cYou wanted gushing, remember? \u2018Don\u2019t just scratch me,\u2019\u201d she said in a mocking parrot of Ava\u2019s earlier words. \u201cTake that shit to the bone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should know me well enough to know when I\u2019m mouthing off.\u201d But this was another reason she\u2019d stunned McKell. Noelle was right. He wouldn\u2019t have let her do this. He was too protective.</p><p>Although he might not be so protective anymore.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t hold back her grunt this time. Not of physical pain, but of mental.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Noelle asked, sheathing her blade. \u201cI didn\u2019t touch you that time, I swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong.\u201d Ava held her arm against her middle, pressing the wound against her stomach. \u201cCome on. We\u2019re wasting time.\u201d</p><p>They left the alley. There was a clinic two miles from here. They planned to walk to it, hopefully drawing vampires out in the open along the way. And if they didn\u2019t, if they failed, well, she\u2019d kicked Noelle\u2019s ass for daring to agree to this shitty idea in the first place.</p><p>If she was going to lose McKell over this, she wanted something good to come of it. Not that any outcome would be good enough.</p><p>Maybe, if she apologized with a kiss, perhaps followed by some heavy petting, he\u2019d be willing to listen to her side. Yeah, she\u2019d jump on that grenade if necessary. Anything to keep him, just for a little longer.</p><p>What\u2019s gotten into you?</p><p>\u201cNothing so far,\u201d Noelle muttered.</p><p>People gaped as Ava walked by, but everyone jumped out of her way, as if she were an infected parasite. Bastards. Would a little compassion have been amiss? She could have been beaten by a boyfriend or have accidentally fallen into a window, for all they knew.</p><p>Worse, the more she and Noelle walked, the more brightly the sun shone, bouncing off glass and metal buildings and burning her skin. She wore her sunglasses, yet still her eyes watered. Why would the vampires want to walk around in this? She couldn\u2019t even remember why she did. Heat seemed to seep through her shirt and jeans, and little beads of sweat broke out over her skin, burning her wound. If she were a vampire, she would\u2014</p><p>Oh, no. No, no, no. She wasn\u2019t going down that thought path. As she\u2019d told McKell, she liked being human. Didn\u2019t she? And she still liked the sun. On every day but today.</p><p>\u201cAnything?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAnything since sixty seconds ago, when I said nothing so far? Nope.\u201d Noelle was the lookout, searching for hungry gazes as they walked. \u201cWhat if we\u2019re going about this the wrong way? What if vampires work at hospitals, where they have an endless supply of blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn endless supply of bagged blood and constant temptation from the injured? No. They\u2019d give themselves away, and they\u2019re afraid of that.\u201d Well, afraid of being found by McKell and those like him.</p><p>\u201cGood point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I said it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemind me never to cut you again. You get grumpy.\u201d</p><p>They turned a corner and hit a crosswalk. They stood there, waiting for the streetlight to switch to red so they could cross. One minute, two, Ava\u2019s legs beginning to shake, but finally the signal flashed, allowing them to pass.</p><p>A car eased to a stop, honked at them, and the driver\u2019s side of the window lowered. A female head peeked out. \u201cHey, do you girls need a ride to the hospital?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d Noelle called, and they continued onward.</p><p>Compassion at last. Still. \u201cI\u2019m starting to get pissed. And offended! Here I am, bleeding all over the place, yet no self-respecting vampire views me as appetizing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should have used my blood. Clearly, I smell better than you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why didn\u2019t McKell call dibs on you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he has no taste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStinker.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, they pushed through a throng of people and rounded another corner. Ava tripped over her own boots, the shaking in her limbs more noticeable. Cold seeped into her fingers and toes, and despite the heat, she actually quaked.</p><p>\u201cSo you really like McKell, huh?\u201d Noelle asked. \u201cAnd don\u2019t try to deny it. He\u2019s lasted days without you kicking him out of your life for good.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to talk about him. Not when she could only picture him frozen in place, cursing her very existence. \u201cMaybe I just can\u2019t shake him loose,\u201d she said, hoping the subject would drop.</p><p>Stubborn Noelle never let anything drop. \u201cPlease. You could shake your teeth loose if you wanted. You like him. Just admit it before I remind you of how I found you when you pulled into my driveway. You know, on your back with your hand down his pants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She might not want to talk about him, but maybe she should. Worry about him and how he felt about her was eating her up inside. \u201cI ... like him.\u201d There. She\u2019d admitted it. And lived. \u201cHe\u2019s just so ... I don\u2019t know. Strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot strong enough. You\u2019ve stabbed him and stunned him twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only got him that last time because he trusted me not to hurt him,\u201d she practically shouted. Why was she defending him so forcefully? Against Noelle, of all people?</p><p>Because she was weakened, she immediately rationalized. And because she didn\u2019t like the thought of anyone, even her best friend, viewing him in such a disparaging way. He was a good man. With faults, sure, but good all the same. And for whatever reason, he clearly did trust Ava. He\u2019d slept at her house, had moved in, made out with her. Hadn\u2019t yelled at her for enjoying satisfaction, yet offering him no release after they were interrupted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That was true strength.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t badmouthing him.

She quickly righted herself and caught up with Noelle, who hadn\u2019t noticed her decreased speed.</p> <p>\u201cAva. Your dad left when you were just a kid, and your drunk-ass mom dated a thousand assholes after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I have daddy issues.\u201d So did a lot of other girls. And Ava was over hers. Really. She no longer cried herself to sleep because other kids had loving daddies to tuck them in at night. (She just didn\u2019t sleep at all.) She no longer watched kids being pushed on swings by their dads, clutching her chest to stop the sudden ache.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have a loving dad, and never had. So what. Her dad had walked away and never looked back. So what. Her mom had seemed to forget about her entirely the day she\u2019d moved out of their trailer. Again, so what. She\u2019d built a great life for herself.</p><p>\u201cSo. We\u2019ve talked about this before, but you were drunk and not listening. So listen now. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re giving someone a chance. Even someone who once belonged to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe never belonged to you.\u201d Ava still didn\u2019t like the thought of McKell being owned by anyone but her. Even her best friend. And yeah, she\u2019d realized that before, but now, weak as she was, she didn\u2019t have the strength to rationalize why. The statement was as much as part of her as her lungs or her heart. Just like McKell.</p> <p>Her eyes widened. She liked him that much?</p><p>Noelle grinned, gray eyes sparkling with an undeniable I-told-you-so. \u201cAlls I\u2019m saying is that you have a fear of abandonment, so you leave before the guy can leave you.\u201d</p><p>True. She\u2019d already realized that, too. Didn\u2019t mean she liked having it pointed out. \u201cWhat are you, a doctor now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Dr. Love. And Dr. Love is also very glad you stopped caring that McKell\u2019s a vampire and an enemy. I mean, Mia\u2019s willing to use him, so AIR doesn\u2019t view him as a bad guy. You shouldn\u2019t either.\u201d</p><p>She tripped again, over a rock this time, and her arm bounced. The subsequent sting had her wincing. A quick glance down showed that her shirt and the waist of her jeans were completely soaked through with blood\u2014and she was still bleeding profusely. Great.</p><p>\u201cCan we continue this conversation when I\u2019m not dying?\u201d she asked. One more block, and they\u2019d reach the clinic.</p> <p>Noelle cast her a glance, and worry replaced the teasing sparkle in her eyes. Okay, no. They couldn\u2019t continue the conversation at another time. Noelle needed the distraction, and Ava now needed to ease her own sense of guilt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not keeping him,\u201d Ava said. Not forever, at least. She wasn\u2019t that far gone.</p><p>Grateful, Noelle picked up where she\u2019d left off. \u201cSee? You plan on leaving him before he can leave you, and you\u2014\u201d She gasped excitedly. \u201cThis is it! This is it! We\u2019ve picked up a tail!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Ava barely restrained the urge to turn and look. Only the thought of tripping and kissing concrete stopped her. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember the car at the first crosswalk? The girl who wanted to help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Human in appearance, young, sweet voice.</p><p>\u201cShe followed us. In fact, she just pulled over and is getting out of her car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you tell?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDuh. The reflections on the shop glass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Good thinking. \u201cI, uh, just didn\u2019t think of that because of my tremendous amount of blood loss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Noelle said dryly.</p><p>\u201cShe could have just reached her office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Now she\u2019s following us on foot. And there\u2019s a guy with her. He got out of the car, too.\u201d</p><p>Excitement raced through Ava, which increased the blood flow in her veins. Which increased the throb in her wound, and the rate at which she drained. The weakness grew more apparent, as did the trembling.</p><p>\u201cWe need cover.\u201d Noelle wrapped her fingers around Ava\u2019s forearm and tugged her into another alley, not stopping until they were in the center, at the edge of a Dumpster. \u201cPretend you\u2019re resting. I\u2019ll pretend I\u2019m fixing your bandage.\u201d As she spoke, she slapped a pyre-gun in Ava\u2019s hand and palmed one for herself.</p><p>Ava kept the weapon at her side, hidden from the entrance to the alley. Sure enough, the pretty female from the car turned the corner and approached, along with an unfamiliar male.</p><p>Neither spoke. There was too much hunger in their eyes. Eyes narrowed on Ava\u2019s wound. The female licked her lips, revealing sharp fangs. Fangs. Even while the sun shone on both of them, their skin remaining unaffected.</p><p>Bingo. Daylight vampires.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d Noelle asked them, unconcerned.</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d the male slurred.</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d Noelle laughed. \u201cLet\u2019s see about that.\u201d</p><p>Ava and Noelle flashed their guns at the same time and fired. Blue beams erupted, momentarily chasing away the shadows cast by the buildings on either side. Both beams hit their targets dead center. Only, the vampires didn\u2019t stop. Didn\u2019t even slow.</p><p>Ava blinked in surprise. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>The answer immediately slid into place. Along with immunization to the sun, the vampires who drained humans to death also developed an immunity to stun rays. Shit! Why hadn\u2019t she thought of that?</p><p>Another answer didn\u2019t have time to form. The vampires launched at her, and there wasn\u2019t even a spare moment to dial her gun to its burn-and-kill setting. The gun was swiped out of her hand, and she was knocked to her ass.</p><p>Still at full strength, Noelle snapped into action, and stopped them from jumping on top of Ava. The three rolled on the hard concrete, arms and legs flailing. Teeth slashing. Noelle yelped, but she didn\u2019t let go. She punched and kicked, and somewhere along the way, she managed to withdraw two blades. She, too, slashed. Only, her weapons were sharper.</p><p>Blood squirted. From Noelle, from the vampires, but none of them slowed. The vamps continued to bite at her, and she continued to swipe at them. Just as Ava gathered the strength to insert herself into the fight, the female slipped past Noelle. Ava\u2019s hair was nearly ripped from her scalp as the vampire raced around her and jerked her backward, dragging ... positioning.</p><p>Ava tore free and straightened. Breathing was a thing of the past, but she twisted, already swinging. Her fist connected with the woman\u2019s jaw, but weak as she was, the blow barely registered. And then the woman punched her back. Her jaw exploded with pain. She saw stars, was falling down ... down ...</p><p>Hell, no. She wasn\u2019t losing this fight. It was two against two, and she liked those odds, even destabilized as she was. When she hit, she grabbed a handful of gravel and kicked the woman away from her, then again made her way to her feet. Without hesitation, she chucked the rocks in the vampire\u2019s face. A howl rent the air as her opponent staggered back and rubbed at her eyes.</p><p>Ava could see that Noelle was still struggling with the male. Bite marks marred her arms, and she was covered in blood. His, her own. Her friend was clearly tired, panting, sweating, her movements at last slower than usual.</p><p>Shit. Perhaps doing this without McKell hadn\u2019t been such a good idea. Perhaps? Ha! But there was no help for it now. She withdrew another gun, a taser, and aimed. Her arm shook, and her grip was feeble. She wasn\u2019t sure how long she could hold on.</p><p>\u201cNoelle,\u201d she shouted. \u201cMove!\u201d Waited ... waited ...</p><p>When Noelle had the opportunity, she jumped backward, out of the way. Ava fired at the male. Contact. He screeched, his entire body vibrating. Noelle then attacked, and now she had the advantage.</p><p>Another screech, this one female, and Ava knew she was about to feel pain. But she didn\u2019t have time to switch the direction of her aim. The gun was kicked out of her hand in less than a blink, the female on top of her, pushing her down. This time she hit, and her skull took the brunt of the fall.</p><p>Pain, oh, yes, pain. Black dots filled her vision as she tried to crawl away, creating distance while reaching for a blade. Her fingers curled around the hilt as something heavy slammed her back down. She twisted, blade raised, but before she made contact, sharp teeth sank into her neck. The pain exploded, and she couldn\u2019t really pinpoint where one ache originated and another ended. She tried to slash. Her wrist was knocked away and pinned like the rest of her.</p><p>She felt the suction, then the cold, then the fragility of her own body. No longer could she move, not even to lift her arms.</p><p>She had lost. She had lost a fight. She was embarrassed, disappointed in herself, fading ... This really was it, she realized. The end. She wanted to laugh bitterly, but the sound snagged in her ravaged throat.</p><p>One regret after another flooded her. She hadn\u2019t made love with McKell. She hadn\u2019t told him good-bye. She wouldn\u2019t see him again.</p><p>In the distance, she thought she heard Noelle curse. A second later, the teeth were ripped out of her. She expected Noelle to smooth the hair from her face, and tell her everything was going to be okay now. Even though they would both know it was a lie. Fading ... But it was a man\u2019s touch she next experienced, soft and tender, and a man\u2019s voice that whispered in her ear.</p><p>\u201cAva, darling. Can you hear me?\u201d</p><p>McKell.</p><p>Pleasure overshadowed all other emotion. She didn\u2019t know if McKell was really there or if she was hallucinating, and she didn\u2019t care. If she was going to die in an alley, she wanted him with her, one way or another.</p><p>He was strong, just as she\u2019d told Noelle, and he treated her as if she were special, not the trash she\u2019d always been called. Despite her human\u2014and, according to him, inferior\u2014origins. He teased her, got her. Didn\u2019t try to change her. Unless you counted changing her from human to vampire, but she didn\u2019t, because he\u2019d promised not to feed her any of his blood.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make you better,\u201d he cooed, and she knew. He was real. Somehow he\u2019d overcome stun, and found her. Her sweet, sweet protector.</p><p>And she trusted him, she realized. He wouldn\u2019t try to change her even now, injured as she was. Even pissed as he had to be. She knew it. She knew him. She\u2019d told him no, and he wouldn\u2019t disregard that. Pride wouldn\u2019t let him.</p><p>Determined hands banded around her, lifted her, gentle and warm. He started forward. His gait was smooth, and she felt like she was floating.</p><p>Where was Noelle? Why wasn\u2019t her friend talking?</p><p>She began to struggle, wanting answers. McKell must have sensed the direction of her thoughts, because he said, \u201cShe\u2019s fine. Noelle is fine.\u201d</p><p>Ava relaxed.</p><p>\u201cNow sleep,\u201d he said silkily, \u201cand I\u2019ll take care of everything. Although, once I\u2019m done, you\u2019ll probably wish I had stayed away.\u201d</p><p>Even then, she trusted him. She slept.</p><p>Twenty-two</p><p>McKell didn\u2019t know what else to do. He convinced a human to haul him and the injured females to Ava\u2019s apartment via removing the blanket hood and flashing his fangs while his skin sizzled. Oh, and issuing a threat of death. Along the way, he phoned Bride, who agreed to meet him there. In fact, by the time the driver had stopped in front of Ava\u2019s building, Bride was already there. With Devyn.</p><p>If that bastard turned the charm on Ava, as he\u2019d done to Bride, McKell would butcher him. Although, to be fair, Ava was much smarter than Bride. He liked these thoughts. They spoke of a future.</p><p>\u201cOpen the door,\u201d he snapped at the human\u2014who may or may not have peed himself.</p><p>\u201cO\u2014open.\u201d The passenger door split from the car frame.</p><p>Noelle was so rattled and weak, she hadn\u2019t said a word the entire drive.</p><p>McKell kicked his way outside with Ava cradled in his arms. She moaned. His blanket slipped and his skin burned, but he didn\u2019t care. He wasn\u2019t going to rush inside. He wouldn\u2019t risk jarring her.</p><p>Bride, who waited in the shade, protected, pushed Devyn forward, a hint to help with the girls. McKell instantly pivoted, moving out of reach.</p><p>\u201cUh, McKell,\u201d Bride said. \u201cLet Devyn take her. You\u2019re nearly deep fried.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her, expecting her to cover herself and follow as he headed toward the building. As he strode past Devyn, he said, \u201cThe other one\u2019s yours. They left two dead vampires in an alley a few blocks away. You might want to call AIR for pickup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure they\u2019re dead?\u201d Devyn called.</p><p>\u201cVery.\u201d He\u2019d removed their heads. Savagely. First his teeth had ripped out their tracheas, then his claws had finished the job. He hadn\u2019t been able to stop himself. Hadn\u2019t wanted to stop himself.</p><p>He\u2019d followed Ava\u2019s scent, dying inside when he spotted her trail of blood. He\u2019d run\u2014and run and run, until finally spying her. And when he had ... murderous instinct had taken over.</p><p>Once inside, he carried Ava past curious onlookers, allowing the blanket to fall the rest of the way, forgotten. Up the elevator and down the hall, until he stood at her door. He didn\u2019t set her down as he reached up and flattened one of his palms on the ID pad. A quick scan, and the door popped open.</p><p>He strode inside, finally allowing himself to glance at Ava. She was pale, the blue veins under her skin evident. There were shadows under her eyes, and cuts all over her neck and arms. The scent of her blood wafted to his nose, and he\u2014</p><p>Sharp teeth sank into his ankle.</p><p>He stumbled, but didn\u2019t let go of his charge. Something growled as he looked down. And spied Hellina. She was drinking his blood greedily. Lapping up every drop she could, and then biting his ankle again for more. Trying, McKell thought, to get to Ava. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His eyes widened as realization struck. Hellina was a vampire. His blood had truly changed her. Impossible, he thought next.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you want Noelle?\u201d Devyn asked from behind him. The warrior must have spied Hellina, because he laughed. \u201cYour girlfriend\u2019s dog hates you. Priceless.\u201d</p><p>Realizing there was another person to snack on, Hellina switched her focus, launching at Devyn\u2019s ankles and biting.</p> <p>Devyn howled. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d He kicked out his leg, trying to shake the hungry dog loose but not succeeding.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a new vampire,\u201d McKell said, \u201cand she\u2019s hungry. Needs to feed.\u201d Even uttering the words was odd.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit about Ava or Noelle being a vampire and hungry right now. I only feed Bride. Now get the dog\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dog is the vampire. Hellina, stop.\u201d To his ever-increasing shock, the dog instantly obeyed, removing her teeth from Devyn\u2019s leg. She panted up at McKell, adoration in her big eyes, blood dripping from her mouth.</p><p>Did she have to obey him because of their blood connection?</p> <p>He couldn\u2019t believe he was even contemplating the possibility. It never should have happened, shouldn\u2019t have been possible. Or did she simply love him and want to please him, as all females should? There would be time to sort that out later. After Ava was healed.</p><p>Ava. \u201cStay,\u201d he told Hellina as he carted Ava to her bedroom. \u201cAnd put Noelle on the couch,\u201d he threw over his shoulder.</p><p>He eased Ava onto the bed, gently, softly, and she gave another of those pained moans. Perhaps he should have taken her to a hospital, but he\u2019d known he could do more for her than anyone else.</p><p>And he would turn her if necessary. He hadn\u2019t known that was a possibility until seeing Hellina, but he\u2019d meant to feed Ava his blood, anyway, mating them. Despite her absolute trust in him. He\u2019d felt that trust as he\u2019d lifted her from the ground, and it had sliced him like a fang. That wouldn\u2019t have stopped him, though. Nothing would have, not when it came to saving her.</p><p>He\u2019d once worried about her shorter lifespan, and had later discarded the worry, uncaring that she would age as long as they were together while she lived. But seeing her so ... broken, and feeling himself break in kind, he\u2019d convinced himself that mating with her would twine them, their lifespans. She would live as long as he did, and he would live as long as she did.</p><p>Except, even with such a hope, he hesitated now. If he did this, she would hate him. He didn\u2019t want her to hate him. But he wouldn\u2019t be able to stop himself from acting much longer. She was covered in so much blood, so pale, so still, and he was ... worried. Yes, that was the tightening in his chest, making a complete mockery of his anger. He should be screaming at this woman for placing herself in danger.</p> <p>That\u2019s part of who she is. A danger seeker. Deal with it, or lose her forever.</p><p>He felt rather than heard Devyn and Bride approach. They stopped, one on each side of him, and peered down at Ava. If either one of them reached out, he would cut off their arms.</p><p>\u201cSo. How do you have a vampire dog?\u201d Bride asked casually. To distract him? \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, I can guess. I\u2019m all-powerful, after all, but I\u2019d really like to hear you say it.\u201d</p><p>Devyn shook his head. \u201cAll-powerful. Please. Mia told me what his blood can do, and I told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t important right now,\u201d McKell snarled. \u201cHow do I heal Ava without giving her my blood?\u201d If there was a way, he\u2019d take it. If not, he would just have to risk her wrath.</p><p>\u201cI can give her my blood,\u201d Bride suggested.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Devyn said with a firm shake of his head\u2014before McKell could issue his own denial. \u201cI\u2019m tired of everyone getting a piece of you. The humans infected by the Sch\u00f6n, AIR agents, your friends. There has to be a line, and you\u2019ve already given some today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d McKell finally got to say aloud. If Ava had anyone\u2019s blood, it would be his. Still. There had to be another way.</p> <p>\u201cMy blood won\u2019t turn her into a vampire,\u201d Bride said. \u201cAs Devyn said, a lot of people have sampled it, and none of them have turned.\u201d</p><p>Ava moaned, and he suddenly found himself wavering, possessiveness giving way to protectiveness. Damn it. She trusted him to keep her human, and that was a stronger deterrent than he\u2019d realized. \u201cWhat if you\u2019re wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDevyn has a sip everyday, and look at him. Pure arrogance and sex appeal, but no fangs. And there\u2019s no danger that she\u2019ll ever have a chance to feed me her blood, binding us for life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re already bonded for life,\u201d Devyn said, his voice stern. \u201cAnd don\u2019t you dare try to get out of it again.\u201d</p><p>Bride rolled her eyes. \u201cI only tried to leave you, what? Four times? Cut me some slack. Anyway,\u201d she said to McKell. \u201cShe\u2019ll heal quickly, and her pain will ease. I promise.\u201d</p><p>The thought of Ava healed ... \u201cShe has to agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen wake her up and ask her already. Although waking her up will only cause her to thrash, and the thrashing could injure her worse. And if she\u2019s injured worse, the healing will take a lot longer. But it\u2019s your call.\u201d Bride reached out, as if to smooth Ava\u2019s hair from her brow.</p><p>McKell hissed at her, and she held her hands up, all innocence. How had he ever thought himself in love with this woman? She was annoying. \u201cGive your blood to Noelle first. I want to see how she reacts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo patients now?\u201d Devyn gave another shake of his head, dark hair falling over his brow and hiding the natural sheen of glitter in his skin. \u201cNo. That\u2019s where I draw the line, Bride. You were stumbling around earlier, so you need every drop you\u2019ve got for yourself.\u201d</p><p>She patted his cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll just be a few minutes.\u201d She strode from the room, leaving McKell alone with a sputtering Devyn.</p><p>\u201cYou owe me for this,\u201d the Targon muttered. \u201cShe\u2019s going to be weak when she\u2019s done, and that will seriously ruin my plans for later.\u201d</p><p>The man had the nerve to complain while Ava lay a few feet away, not really dying but cutting it close? At least, that\u2019s what he told himself. Otherwise, he would have been clawing at the walls.</p><p>\u201cMake yourself useful,\u201d McKell snapped at him. \u201cHer cupboards and refrigerator are nearly bare. Fill them.\u201d</p><p>Devyn\u2019s amber eyes widened. They were lighter than Ava\u2019s, but close enough in color that McKell decided the bastard could live. \u201cYou want me to shop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And she loves butterscotch. Buy her as much butterscotch as you can find. She\u2019ll want a treat when she wakes up.\u201d Because he planned to yell at her, maybe make her cry, and the food would comfort her when he was done, his concern and anger appeased.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I lie about butterscotch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear God, you\u2019re clueless. I meant, you\u2019re serious about expecting me to shop for your woman\u2019s treats? Won\u2019t she like them better if you buy them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. They\u2019ll still taste the same, and besides that, I don\u2019t have any money. In fact, I\u2019m going to need you to open me an account.\u201d One of Ava\u2019s requirements for a man had been \u201crich.\u201d \u201cI want enough money to last an eternity making this woman happy.\u201d</p><p>Devyn scrubbed a hand down his face. \u201cSo I\u2019m your sugar daddy now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou took my woman,\u201d he reminded the man. Yet the words tasted ... wrong. He didn\u2019t like referring to Bride as his woman anymore. She wasn\u2019t. Never had been. Not really.</p><p>\u201cShe was never yours,\u201d Devyn growled in his first real show of anger.</p><p>\u201cI know. And I\u2019m glad. I like the one I have. Now help me keep her.\u201d</p><p>That drained the anger right out of the Targon. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll make a few calls and have shit delivered, but I am not leaving you alone with Bride. And I\u2019ll also open you an account, but that\u2019s the last favor I\u2019m doing for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil I think of something else for you to do. Like buying me clothing.\u201d He nodded, realizing he did indeed need new clothes. \u201cI like what you\u2019re wearing, though I\u2019ll probably need a bigger size.\u201d His gaze dropped to Devyn\u2019s waist. \u201cA lot bigger. And make sure to get me something for every day of the week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood Lord.\u201d Devyn was shaking his head as he withdrew his phone and started making those calls. He stated his demands simply, expecting absolute compliance from everyone he spoke to. He probably got it, too. McKell admired his authoritative superiority.</p><p>McKell sat beside Ava, careful not to disturb her. He failed. She groaned and rolled toward him, as if she\u2019d been waiting for him. He twined their fingers, not liking how cold her skin was, how slow her pulse.</p><p>Finally Bride returned to the bedroom, Noelle at her side. Noelle was still pale, a little shaky, but she was on her feet and still human. Relief flooded him. Ava wouldn\u2019t be able to find fault with his choice for her. He hoped.</p><p>\u201cIs she\u2014\u201d Noelle began.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he snapped. \u201cWhat were you thinking, fighting vampires without me? Do you have any idea\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLecture her later. I have business to attend to now.\u201d Bride strode forward, shaky herself, and eased on Ava\u2019s other side.</p><p>McKell held her arms down, just in case she awoke during the transfusion and tried to push Bride away. \u201cDo it,\u201d he gritted out. \u201cFeed her.\u201d</p><p>Bride unsheathed a knife from her side and slashed her wrist over a still-healing scab. Grimacing, she held the now dripping wrist over Ava\u2019s pretty mouth. Closed pretty mouth. Bride dropped the knife and used her freed fingers to pry those lips apart.</p><p>He tensed a little more with every drop that slid home. Don\u2019t blame me for this. Don\u2019t you dare blame me. If she did, he\u2019d ... what? He didn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cWe never would have worked out, you know,\u201d Bride said. \u201cYou\u2019re too bossy and, well, selfish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not Ava.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, there is that.\u201d</p><p>An eternity passed while the vampire\u2019s blood continued to drip, but soon Ava began to swallow on her own. Still another eternity passed while Bride straightened, withdrew her arm, and they waited. And waited.</p><p>Finally, Ava\u2019s eyelashes fluttered open, and those dark eyes scanned the room, confusion in their depths. Several more minutes passed while she oriented herself. He waited, stiff.</p><p>\u201cMcKell,\u201d she croaked out.</p><p>Hearing her voice, he knew beyond any doubt that she would be okay, that her throat was healing. \u201cLeave,\u201d he said.</p><p>Her brow furrowed. \u201cBut this is my house. Isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot you. Everyone else, leave.\u201d He didn\u2019t look away from her. \u201cNow.\u201d He wanted to explain what had been done to her without an audience. Meaning, he wanted to subdue her when she attacked him without an audience. She was going to blame him; there was no denying that now.</p><p>Footsteps sounded. A dog barked. From the living room, he heard Noelle say, \u201cWhat\u2019s Hellina doing here? Come on, baby.\u201d Pause. \u201cCome on.\u201d Another pause. \u201cWhy\u2019s she ignoring me? And why is she staring at the pulse in my neck?\u201d</p><p>Bride and Devyn must have dragged her out, because the door finally snickered closed.</p><p>Ava watched him the entire time, rubbing her now scabbed-over neck.</p><p>\u201cThe vampires injured you,\u201d he began, bracing himself. \u201cBride Targon gave you her blood to repair the damage.\u201d</p><p>He waited for the explosion of temper.</p><p>\u201cOh, okay,\u201d Ava said, gingerly sitting up and resting her weight on her elbows. The cut on her arm had yet to fully close, and she winced.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all you have to say to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps she didn\u2019t understand what had happened. \u201cI fed you another vampire\u2019s blood. In your mouth, down your throat. You drank it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and her blood has been given to many AIR agents already, so I know I can handle it.\u201d</p><p>All his worry, and that was her reaction? He jackknifed to his feet and paced in front of the bed. \u201cSince you can handle so much, let\u2019s begin with your apology. But before you do, allow me to instruct you on everything you need to apologize for. You stunned me, left me in unfamiliar surroundings with unfamiliar people who could have tried to kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow listen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t done! Then you fought vampires. Even though you knew how dangerous they could be!\u201d He was screaming now and couldn\u2019t temper his voice. \u201cYou almost died. How dare you almost die, Ava! You did not have permission to do that.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him. \u201cI need permission to die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilence!\u201d Every time she spoke, his anger only intensified. \u201cYour arm was mangled, and I thought you\u2019d never be able to use it again. Your neck was savaged, and I thought you\u2019d ... I thought you\u2019d ...\u201d He couldn\u2019t even say the words.</p><p>\u201cYou did not,\u201d was her only reply.</p><p>Anger ... intensifying ... He wanted her screaming back at him, concerned, worried, something. \u201cThe arm was almost a deal breaker, but I decided you could still please me with the other one.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed, and he thought he had her, but all she said was, \u201cThe injury wasn\u2019t that bad.\u201d</p><p>So. Much. Anger. His hands fisted. Without a word, he stalked to the bed, hefted her over his shoulder, and carted her to the shower stall. He dumped her inside and left her there, slamming the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come out until you\u2019re ready to apologize for everything!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He waited for a response. He didn\u2019t get one.</p><p>Fuming, he stomped into the living room, flopped onto the couch, and petted Hellina. She couldn\u2019t speak, so she didn\u2019t anger him. She even managed to calm him somewhat as she licked him, that adoration like a living thing in her gaze. If everyone he turned acted this way, he would turn Ava before the sun set. She\u2019d love him too much to be pissed.</p><p>At some point, he heard her trudge out of the bathroom, putter around the bedroom, and dress, but she never came to find him. That was for the best. Devyn\u2019s deliveries began arriving, and McKell compelled the deliverers to stand still and allow Hellina to drink her fill. After the fourth feeding, the dog fell asleep on the floor.</p> <p>McKell decided he was calm enough to deal with Ava now. Well, as calm as he could get without spanking her. Spanking. Yes. That was acceptable. He grabbed the whip he\u2019d brought with him during his first visit\u2014someone had placed it on the coffee table\u2014and stormed into the bedroom with every intention of tying her up before throwing her over his knees. She sat at the edge of the bed, her siren\u2019s body wrapped only in a fluffy white towel. Rather than grabbing her, he studied her.</p><p>Her shoulders were hunched, her hair was brushed to a coiled shine, and all of her cuts and bruises were nearly gone. Her skin was once again a perfect sun-kissed peach, her pulse drumming wildly, strong. She smelled a little like Bride, flowers and mint, but underneath those new scents he still caught a hint of orchids and butterscotch.</p><p>His mouth instantly watered. All thoughts of spanking vanished, and though he wanted to jump on her, finally have her, take her, own her, her upset held him immobile. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I lost a fight,\u201d she said, and there was a slight quiver to her voice.</p><p>That hesitation ... he doubted she\u2019d meant to mention the fight, but she had, so they would deal with that first. \u201cYou lost because you were stupid about it.\u201d</p> <p>The quiver moved to her chin. \u201cSpare my feelings, why don\u2019t you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know you were.\u201d Was she about to ... cry? This woman who often snarled, had stabbed him twice, tasered him once, and kissed him so intently he could have been lost forever, all without backing down?</p><p>She shrugged those dainty shoulders and looked away, to someplace he couldn\u2019t see. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what else is bothering you?\u201d he asked gently.</p><p>\u201cI just ...\u201d She swallowed. \u201cYou\u2019re mad at me.\u201d</p><p>And that pushed her to the brink of tears? \u201cYes.\u201d Even though he despised the thought of making her cry, he wouldn\u2019t back down in this. Her safety came before her feelings.</p> <p>\u201cSo now you\u2019re going to whip me and leave.\u201d She stood in one fluid motion and finally, finally, he was faced with the fury he\u2019d craved. Darks waves of it pulsed from her, wrapped around him, and squeezed tightly. He embraced every gossamer strand. \u201cWell, guess what? That\u2019s fine. Do it! Go! I didn\u2019t want you here, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Mixed with the anger, he now heard fear, and that he couldn\u2019t welcome. Especially when the words that came with the emotion were like a knife in the heart. \u201cI\u2019m going to assume Bride\u2019s blood is talking, not you. Because you know I would never mar your skin. You also know I\u2019m here to stay.\u201d</p><p>Just like that, the fire drained right out of her, and she gazed at him through the thick shield of her lashes, hopeful. \u201cYou\u2019re staying?\u201d</p><p>That sting in his heart drained, too. He\u2019d take the hope over the anger any day. \u201cYes. Why would I leave? I live here now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I keep hurting you and nearly got myself killed. After you warned me about the dangers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich you will not do again. Promise me.\u201d It was a command he wouldn\u2019t allow her to ignore.</p><p>\u201cI promise, and I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered, delighting him. \u201cBut why do you care so\u2014you need my blood.\u201d There at the end, her voice had picked up volume and flattened. \u201cI get it now. You\u2019re not staying because you like me, you\u2019re staying because you need me. Why else would you have moved in with a lowly human? Not that you\u2019re officially moved in. I haven\u2019t said yes to anything permanent.\u201d</p><p>That he\u2019d once thought the same thing\u2014lowly human\u2014now settled heavily on his shoulders, but he didn\u2019t let it weigh him down and send him fleeing. The outcome of this was too important.</p> <p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t a lowly human, Ava. You\u2019re my human. And I\u2019m here for your blood, yes.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t lie about that. Couldn\u2019t. \u201cBut I\u2019m also here for you. Your kisses ... your body ...\u201d He stalked toward her, intent in every step. \u201cAnd now I\u2019m going to have them, once and for all.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-three</p><p>So many thoughts whirled through Ava\u2019s mind as McKell closed the distance between them, and somehow she was able to reflect on each one in a heartbeat of time. She\u2019d fainted during a fight. Which meant she had lost that fight. McKell had saved her as if she were a damsel in distress. Embarrassing. He had also arranged for her healing. Sweet. She\u2019d trusted him not to turn her into a vampire, and he hadn\u2019t. Confusing.</p><p>Why had she trusted him while she\u2019d been at her most vulnerable? Why had he helped her when he could have struck? She\u2019d left him behind, almost helpless. \u201cAlmost,\u201d because McKell always found a way to save himself. And why, when she\u2019d woken up in bed, McKell hovering over her, had she known everything was going to be okay? As if they were together irrevocably and would stay that way. As if he belonged in her life. As if he was exactly where he needed to be.</p><p>Then he\u2019d stormed out of her room, pissed and seething. She\u2019d taken a shower and wondered if he was packing his stuff. And she\u2019d cried. Cried like a goddamn baby! She didn\u2019t need him, she\u2019d told herself. She didn\u2019t need anyone, and never had. That\u2019s the way it had always been, and would always be. She could even live without Noelle, if necessary, though she didn\u2019t want to. But McKell ...</p><p>Flayed her alive, left her reeling, panicked but eager. Desperate. Needy. He\u2014</p><p>Was right in front of her now, she realized, and she was blinking up at him.</p><p>His face had healed, all hint of his burns gone. His nostrils were flared as he sucked in a torrent of air. His color was high, his usually violet eyes flecked with so much emerald they were like flashing \u201cgo\u201d signs that reached her soul.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want him to stay just because he needed her blood. She wanted him to want her. Because he liked her. Her smile, her laugh, her sense of humor. Her crudeness, coarseness, everything. All the good, plus the bad. And yeah, she knew what a tall order that was. An order no man could probably meet.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t easy to be around at the best of times, and during the worst, well, she sucked flaming balls of mean. Look at the way she\u2019d snapped at him, demanding he leave. Still, she wanted his eternal admiration.</p><p>But her most important wish? She wanted him to like her as a human. Not as a potential vampire. She wanted him to consider her good enough, just the way she was. And maybe he was on that road already.</p><p>You\u2019re my human, he\u2019d said, and every feminine instinct she possessed had sung a choirs of hallelujah, reminding her that he did sometimes make her feel special. But as always, doubt intruded. How long would he feel that way? Eventually everyone found fault with who she really was.</p><p>\u201cAva,\u201d McKell rasped.</p><p>She licked her lips. He was here, and he was lusting after her. For the moment, that was enough. Because she couldn\u2019t send him away again. She just didn\u2019t have the strength.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have you, woman. If you resist, I\u2019ll tie you up. I swear I will.\u201d He lifted the whip threateningly.</p><p>\u201cNo need to tie me up.\u201d</p><p>His pupils expanded, but he didn\u2019t yet move in for the kill. \u201cFor us to be together, and be able to tell everyone about it, I must aid AIR?\u201d His warm breath trekked over her skin, teasing her.</p><p>Why wasn\u2019t he touching her? Just then, she didn\u2019t care if the entire world knew. Just then, he was hers. Tomorrow\u2014today? In her sick, weak haze, she\u2019d lost track of time\u2014she would take him to AIR headquarters, head held high. People could think what they wanted, and for once, the thought of her peers calling her trash didn\u2019t bother her.</p><p>\u201cAva,\u201d he prompted again. He bound one of her wrists in a loop he\u2019d created in the leather. A warning. Then he traced a knuckle over her cheekbone, gentle, tender, and she quivered.</p><p>Finally. Touching. \u201cMcKell. I\u2014I don\u2019t care if you aid AIR. That has no bearing on this.\u201d Shocking, even to her. \u201cOnly thing I ask is that you don\u2019t turn me.\u201d</p><p>He gave a tug, and the leather tightened on her. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I have to be good enough, just as I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are.\u201d</p><p>Fear once more reared its head. For how long? She had to make him understand what his claims of superiority did to her. \u201cHow would you like it if I insisted you become human?\u201d</p><p>He blanched. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Just as she\u2019d thought. \u201cIt hurts to be considered inferior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never want to hurt you.\u201d His voice was a blade jerked from its sheath. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that I did. But I am going to have you, Ava. You\u2019re not going to push me away. Not this time.\u201d</p><p>She released a breath she hadn\u2019t known she\u2019d been holding. \u201cWell, okay. I\u2019m glad that\u2019s still on the table.\u201d</p><p>His gaze flicked to the bed behind her, then moved back to her face. Heat pulsed from him. \u201cA table? Yes, I can take you on a table.\u201d</p><p>Darling man. \u201cNo. I mean, I do want to have sex with you.\u201d</p><p>A dark brow arched. \u201cIs the table an option or not?\u201d</p><p>Part of her wanted to laugh, but all of her trembled with anticipation. \u201cDoes it matter?\u201d</p><p>He crowded her, easing her back until her knees hit the edge of the mattress. He claimed her other wrist, wrapped the leather around it, too, forcing her to arch her back, her breasts rubbing his chest. Took all of her strength, but she managed to remain upright. Leaning, but upright.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you however I can get you,\u201d he whispered roughly.</p><p>The words, his voice, the need in his eyes, like electrical currents raging through her. \u201cThen let me go and I\u2019ll get rid of the towel.\u201d</p><p>Like a rubber band being snapped, he yanked his body into a straight line, increasing the murmur of air between them. He unwound the whip and tossed the coiled length to the floor.</p><p>With shaky hands, she tugged at the towel. The material fell in a pool at her feet.</p><p>A bead of sweat formed on his brow. But he reacted to her nakedness in no other way.</p><p>\u201cMc\u2014McKell?\u201d Uncertainty intruded.</p><p>He kept his gaze on her face, a muscle ticking in his jaw. \u201cBefore we begin, and if I look down, I\u2019ll begin, let\u2019s be clear on what I want to do, as sex and fucking aren\u2019t apt descriptions. I\u2019m going to have you, every inch of you. With my mouth, my hands, my cock. I\u2019m going to drink from you, straight from your neck, perhaps even your thigh. When I\u2019m done, there\u2019ll be no part of you I haven\u2019t touched.\u201d</p><p>A cool breeze enveloped her, but she suddenly didn\u2019t care. She liked the goose bumps that formed. They were like a road map to every location she wanted his tongue. In other words, everywhere.</p><p>\u201cAva. Your response. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromises, promises,\u201d she said, and wrapped her arms around his neck. She jerked him down for a kiss.</p><p>He didn\u2019t hesitate. Their lips met, and their tongues instantly tangled together. His body aligned with hers, rigid determination against melting softness, and her entire world spun out of control. She held McKell tighter, her only anchor in that sensual storm.</p><p>He tasted like butterscotch and wicked sex, filling her mouth, sliding down her throat. Overwhelming her, branding her. It was as if she hadn\u2019t been sad and depressed a short while ago. As if she\u2019d been sensitized and hungry for days, years, and had only now found sustenance.</p><p>Her legs shook uncontrollably, and she barely stopped herself from climbing him. The orgasm he\u2019d given her earlier should have left her sated, but as McKell continued to feed her kiss after drugging kiss, fire spread through her, increasing the hunger pains, heating her up, demanding another.</p><p>She might never get enough of this man.</p><p>And that thought should have scared her enough to send her running and screaming from the room. But one of his hands snaked around her waist and forced her deeper into the hard line of his body, that wall of strength and fire, and the thought of running was massacred. Brutally. Wonderfully. The thought of screaming, however ...</p><p>More. She needed more. All. All that he\u2019d promised. His other hand kneaded her breast frantically, rolling her nipple, pinching, and she gasped, strong tendrils of pleasure shooting through her.</p><p>\u201cClothes,\u201d she rasped, tugging at the hem of his shirt. Skin-to-skin. Now.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he replied, biting at her lip. \u201cI have them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake them off.\u201d</p><p>Both of his hands settled on her waist. A second later, she was soaring through the air. There was no time to react, no time to wonder what was happening. The next time she blinked, she was lying on top of the mattress, and he was at the foot of the bed, stripping.</p><p>The separation allowed her to catch her breath. Catching her breath allowed the fever in her veins to simmer.</p><p>She watched as he ripped his shirt over his head, revealing rope after rope of muscle, the bone necklace clinking as it settled on his chest. The scar she\u2019d admired the night they met, the one bracketed between his pecs, had her mouth watering.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you get the scar?\u201d she asked, certain he picked up on her desire to lick it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTraining with my father. I was young, not yet able to heal without lingering effects, and he cut me open from neck to navel to teach me a lesson.\u201d His motions never slowed.</p><p>\u201cYou learned that lesson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I had. Never trust an opponent. Even one you love.\u201d</p> <p>He unfastened his pants, and down they were pushed. No underwear. She caught sight of his erection and nearly wept with wonder. Maybe, since vampires seemed to live forever, he\u2019d been on earth during the human/alien war some eighty years ago and had come into contact with some kind of nuclear ... something. Because damn. He was huge. Bigger than any man she\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>Long, thick, hard, with a plump head that would stroke her just right. His sac was drawn up tight, beautiful. He had no body hair that she could see, and anyone else she would have assumed waxed. But he wasn\u2019t the type to care what anyone else thought. He liked himself just fine. Maybe too fine, but still, that kind of confidence was attractive. Heady. And in his case, warranted.</p><p>One knee, two, he climbed atop the bed. His gaze never left hers, even when he stopped at her waist, his legs cradling hers. Rather than fall on her and devour as she hoped, he stayed where he was, just breathing her in.</p><p>\u201cNow I get to look at you,\u201d he rasped.</p><p>His gaze tracked her, every inch of her, lingering on her beaded nipples, her quivering navel, between her legs. Soon she was panting, on fire again, utterly desperate because those eyes caressed.</p> <p>\u201cYour nipples are like berries,\u201d he said. \u201cYour stomach is a naughty little tease leading to ...\u201d He traced a fingertip to the small thatch of curls, so soft, so gentle. \u201cThis little treasure.\u201d</p><p>Oh, God. She needed a stronger touch, a deeper touch. Now.</p><p>\u201cMcKell,\u201d she said. Begged. \u201cVictor. Please.\u201d</p><p>He leaned back on his haunches, grabbed her legs and spread them wider, as wide they would go. But again, he didn\u2019t fall on her. His gaze returned to her core, and his fangs extended.</p><p>He licked his lips, flicked his tongue over those sharp incisors. \u201cYou\u2019re so pretty there. So wet. So mine.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to touch her yet, she realized. He was simply going to torture her.</p> <p>\u201cCan I touch what\u2019s yours? Please.\u201d She reached down and thrummed her clitoris. At that first needed contact, her hips arched off the bed, and she moaned. Yes.</p><p>\u201cAva,\u201d he growled.</p><p>She stilled, the mattress quaking with the force such a cessation required. \u201cYes?\u201d Would he tell her to stop?</p><p>\u201cDo that again,\u201d he said, a hoarse entreaty.</p><p>One she didn\u2019t mind obeying. Over and over she circled her clit, her hips pumping with the movement. All the while he watched, stroking himself, fangs sharp and gleaming, and that ramped up her arousal.</p><p>\u201cMake yourself come.\u201d</p><p>Again, she didn\u2019t mind obeying. She pressed harder, circled more intently, the pleasure building, breaking, slamming through her. She cried out, muscles clenching on bone, stars winking behind her eyes.</p><p>As she came down from the high, she refocused on him and realized he was still stroking his shaft, up and down, the motions smooth, even though his hand trembled. Her needy body once again lit up in flames, craving a taste of the sensual man in front of her.</p> <p>\u201cThat was beautiful,\u201d he croaked out. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a woman take care of herself before.\u201d</p><p>Just watching him, that plump head hidden by his hand, then revealed, then hidden again, caused her excitement to veer toward the edge of another climax. He was the beautiful one. Pure masculinity, utter warrior.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cFor you, yes.\u201d He stilled.</p><p>She moaned, reached out. \u201cFor you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI almost lost you,\u201d he whispered, taking her hand, kissing her knuckles. \u201cPromise you\u2019ll never leave me behind like that again.\u201d When she hesitated, he added, \u201cYou\u2019ve already promised not to purposefully endanger yourself. This vow asks no more of you than that one.\u201d</p><p>This wasn\u2019t an ultimatum on his part, she knew. He wouldn\u2019t leave her unsated if she refused. He was concerned, that was all, and even that was a stimulant. \u201cI promise,\u201d she said, and she meant it.</p><p>\u201cMy good girl.\u201d Finally he fell on her. He sucked on her nipples, hard, his fangs nearly breaking skin. She loved it, loved every sensation. For every swipe of his tongue, every nibble of his teeth, drove her need higher ... higher ... just the way she\u2019d wanted, until she was writhing, clawing at his back, tugging at his hair.</p><p>He was going to make her come again, just by lavishing attention on her breasts. No, no, no, she thought. That would make three for her and zero for him. Even in her lust-fog, she knew she wanted him receiving an equal amount of pleasure.</p><p>Ava flattened her hands on his chest and pushed. He fell to his back, and she rose over him, honey curls forming a curtain around their faces. His hips arched up, rubbing his shaft against her moist folds, but not penetrating, and they both groaned. At last she got to lick his scar, tracing the edges with her tongue, and clearly, he liked. He gripped the sheets, ripping them to shreds.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to suck you,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I won\u2019t let you come. Not yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Do you think you\u2019ll dislike the taste of my seed?\u201d How disappointed he sounded.</p><p>\u201cOh, I know I\u2019ll like the taste.\u201d Truth. There was nothing she disliked about this man. \u201cBut I want you to come inside me.\u201d Or rather, in a condom, while thrusting hard and deep. Oh, yes. Soon. Please.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not like those puny\u2014those humans.\u201d He reached up and smoothed the hair from her face. \u201cI can come in your mouth, please let me come in your mouth, and then immediately come inside you.\u201d</p><p>The disappointment had given way to desperation. \u201cImmediately, hmm? So you don\u2019t think you can last once you get inside me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not\u2014I won\u2019t\u2014I can last!\u201d</p><p>She tried not to grin. So easy to tease, this one. \u201cWell, lucky for you I\u2019m going to make you prove both claims.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust prepare to be awed.\u201d</p><p>The grin grew, unstoppable. Ava inched down his body and when that beautiful cock was poised at the entrance of her mouth, she sucked him inside without hesitation. His width stretched her jaw, made it burn, but wow, a burn she welcomed, taking him all the way to the back of her throat and humming.</p><p>His hands fisted in her hair. Over and over he chanted her name, but soon he was incoherent. She cupped his balls, squeezed, tugged. Everything she did seemed to fuel his need, and that made her proud, made her want to work him harder. So she did. As she pushed down, she rubbed her tongue over the shaft. As she lifted, she lightly scraped with her teeth.</p><p>\u201cAva,\u201d he groaned, and that was the only warning she had before he jetted white-hot inside her mouth.</p><p>She swallowed every drop, loving that she had brought him to this point, astonished that her own need was stronger than ever. That her skin was heated, molten, her muscles aching, and her bones shaking. She couldn\u2019t bring herself to release him, especially when, true to his word, he immediately grew hard. Harder, actually.</p><p>As she began eating him up yet again, he latched onto her arms and jerked her upright, at the same time rolling her over. Still no penetration. Not yet. She pleaded with her gaze. Please. Need. Now.</p><p>Understanding or not, he cupped her jaw and peered deep into her eyes, perhaps seeing into her soul. His violet eyes were bright, his lips swollen, red, his fangs elongated, sharp.</p><p>She wrapped her legs around his waist, and locked her ankles against his lower back. Hint, hint, but still he didn\u2019t sink inside. Maybe his come was an aphrodisiac, because she burned. She craved. She had to have him, would die soon, surely. Was lost, falling, spinning, riding a wave of pure sensation, more and more of those stars winking.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine,\u201d he growled. \u201cYou know this, yes?\u201d</p><p>Yes. Oh, yes. Forever. But with the strange thought\u2014forever?\u2014common sense intruded for a brief moment. \u201cC-condom,\u201d she said.</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA ... wrapper for your cock ... to prevent pregnancy ... and disease ... and if you don\u2019t fuck me soon, I\u2019m going to kill you.\u201d</p><p>His hips pressed, teasing. \u201cI don\u2019t get diseases.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, do you want to make a baby with me?\u201d She\u2019d never wanted a child. Thought she never would. But this conversation reminded her of the little McKell she\u2019d imagined running around her apartment, and how she hadn\u2019t been completely repulsed, and had maybe even been a little intrigued, and ...</p><p>Stop, she screamed at her mind. Enough thoughts of forever and kids.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he replied, \u201cno children.\u201d Like her, he didn\u2019t sound convinced. \u201cBut I think I told you that vampires don\u2019t produce children very often, and never with humans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>So they couldn\u2019t have kids. That was a good thing. Really. She could have McKell all to herself ... \u201cThen why aren\u2019t you inside me? Make me yours, McKell.\u201d</p><p>The last word left her, and he reacted instantly. He shoved inside her at last, roaring, hitting her deep, all the way to her core. Sweet merciful heaven. She arched up, sending him even deeper, and shouted his name.</p><p>Her nails drove into his ass, urging him to slam in and out of her. Which he did. With so much force her brain rattled against her skull. But God, she couldn\u2019t stop him. Didn\u2019t want to stop him. Just wanted more, more, more.</p><p>True to his word\u2014again\u2014he lasted. Every thrust increased her need, her pleasure. She bit at him, wanting so badly to break his skin, to taste his blood. A want she couldn\u2019t tamp down. She wanted to stay joined with him forever.</p><p>Forever. There was that word again. Just thinking it was almost enough to send her flying over the edge. Almost. There was something else she needed ... something just out of reach ...</p><p>\u201cMcKell,\u201d she gasped, not knowing what it was, what she had to have.</p><p>But he knew, he understood. He sank his fangs straight into her neck, so deep he hit a tendon. God, even that was ecstasy. She climaxed immediately, tightening around his shaft, screaming, begging, lost again, so lost.</p><p>He drank and drank and drank, his gulps in rhythm with his thrusts, and then he, too, was coming, shooting inside her, shouting her name. And maybe his seed really was a drug, an aphrodisiac like she\u2019d assumed, because knowing they were skin to skin, that there was nothing between them, that he was filling her up, the first man to truly touch her this way, had her coming again. Coming so hard she couldn\u2019t breathe, could no longer speak.</p><p>A long while later, she collapsed against the mattress, McKell still on top of her, still inside her. He collapsed, too, his weight smashing her. She didn\u2019t care. She loved that weight.</p><p>He\u2019d said she belonged to him, had called her his, and just then, she believed him. And she liked it. Maybe that was the afterglow talking, but she\u2019d figure everything out later. Right now, there were better things to do.</p><p>For once she didn\u2019t hop from the bed and leave her lover behind. She closed her eyes and slept. Content. She was content.</p><p>Twenty-four</p><p>His woman had let him love her and drink from her, McKell thought, satisfaction slamming through him. He tightened his hold on the still sleeping Ava, and a breathy sigh escaped her. That sound ... like a match being lit ...</p><p>Only an hour had passed since she\u2019d slipped into this unconscious state, yet he suddenly wanted her again. Wanted her with a desperation that frightened him. Craving a human this much, a nonmated human, was unwise.</p><p>When the bond was complete, if she would ever allow him to complete it, he would want her even more. Which meant he would be even more obsessed, more under her spell, more hers than his own. Not that he cared. He just wanted to turn her. So badly.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t going to happen anytime soon, though. He\u2019d bruised her pride, made her feel like humans were inferior\u2014and they weren\u2019t. How could they be when Ava was one? But Ava was better than humans and vampires. Now she wouldn\u2019t even consider the possibility of turning.</p><p>His fault, he knew. How would you feel if I insisted you become human? she\u2019d said. He would have hated it, felt inferior. As he\u2019d made her feel.</p><p>If he would have kept his big mouth shut, rather than making her feel like she wasn\u2019t good enough, just as she was, she might have entertained the notion one day. So that they could be together. Forever.</p><p>Forever, exactly what he wanted with her.</p><p>Perhaps he could fix things, he thought. She had mentioned reversing time before. Perhaps he could. Perhaps his past failure stemmed from the fact that he just hadn\u2019t had the proper motivation. And as Ava had said, since he could manipulate time in one direction, why not all directions?</p><p>If he could reverse time, to the first day he met her, keeping the memories he had, he could change the way he\u2019d acted, the way he\u2019d treated her. He could make her feel special from the very beginning, so that she would be happy to become vampire, protecting herself for eternity.</p><p>He liked that idea. A lot. Only problem was, he didn\u2019t like the thought of her not knowing him. Of waiting to kiss her and touch her until she got to know him again. Of living somewhere other than this home. Their home. And what if, by starting over, he lost his memory of her? He would do nothing different. Or would he? Would he even end up in the same place?</p><p>Hmm. Were the possible rewards worth the mounting risks?</p><p>He didn\u2019t know. Whatever happened, he just wanted to be with her.</p><p>How he laughed at his earlier foolishness, thinking he would one day kill her to make room for someone else. There would be no killing her. Ever. He didn\u2019t want to be set free. Didn\u2019t want to find anyone else. Someone more suitable. He snorted. How could he ever have thought such a thing? There was no one more suitable. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was wonderfully lusty, uninhibited, brave\u2014perhaps too brave\u2014determined, stubborn\u2014perhaps too stubborn\u2014and witty. There was no one more beautiful, both an angel and a devil. No one who could calm him from a temper with only a smile. No one who could capture his notice so thoroughly, the rest of the world fading away. No one who tasted as sweet or strengthened him so completely.</p><p>She was the other half of him, the better half, and something he hadn\u2019t known he\u2019d been missing until now. But ... how did she feel about him? Not for one moment did he presume to think sex had changed everything and now she would want him unconditionally. That wasn\u2019t her style. Not this woman who made him work for every scrap of affection. Work he didn\u2019t mind. Actually enjoyed, challenged in a way he\u2019d never been before.</p><p>If anything, she would have more demands for him. More rules\u2014for him to break, he added with a twinge of anticipation.</p> <p>He wouldn\u2019t worry about the problems just yet, he thought. He had too much to look forward to. Namely, having her again.</p><p>McKell grinned as he, too, fell asleep.</p><p>\u201cWake up.\u201d Ava shook McKell\u2019s shoulders. Big, strong, hot shoulders. Bare, lickable. She\u2019d squeezed and kneaded those shoulders. Scratched and pounded on them. With those thoughts, an ache only he could assuage bloomed.</p><p>Her teeth ground together. No more thinking about him that way. At least while there was work to be done. Later, though ...</p><p>She shook him again, harder than she\u2019d intended.</p> <p>Nothing. No reaction.</p><p>\u201cMcKell.\u201d</p><p>Again, nothing.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t moved when her cell had erupted, signaling a text from Mia. He hadn\u2019t sighed as she\u2019d scrambled from the bed, shocked that she\u2019d slept so long. Or at all. How many years had passed since she\u2019d snoozed more than an hour at a time? And never that deeply.</p><p>On some soul-searing level she didn\u2019t yet understand, she must have felt safe with him here. Knowledge that thrilled her even as it scared her. The longer they were together, the more she\u2019d come to depend on him.</p><p>Thoughts derailing. Again. Anyway. He hadn\u2019t made a noise while she\u2019d showered, dug through her dressers, and found something to wear. He hadn\u2019t peeked while she\u2019d grunted and groaned, shimmying into the clothing. She knew because she\u2019d been staring at his beautiful face the whole time.</p> <p>Okay, his penis. She\u2019d been staring at his penis. The covers had fallen off the bed, revealing every inch of his delectable body, but that penis hadn\u2019t even twitched. And she\u2019d so hoped ... Not gonna think about him that way. Anyway. No twitching meant no peeking.</p><p>Had she left him in a sexual coma of bliss?</p><p>Mama liked the idea. A lot. And she liked seeing him in her bed, knowing he was surrounded by her scent. That kind of made him hers, in an undeniable, almost tangible way. Like he wore a \u201cProperty of Ava\u201d stamp. At least for now. Until they parted. Which would happen, despite the fact that she wanted him more than she\u2019d ever wanted anyone else, because they couldn\u2019t meet each others\u2019 needs. Not all the way. She couldn\u2019t forget that fact; it was one of the reasons she had to stop thinking of him in such sexually explicit terms.</p><p>Sex equaled addiction when you placed it before duty and addiction equaled a need for more. Mmm, more ...</p><p>Argh! \u201cMcKell.\u201d Not knowing what else to do, she slapped him.</p><p>Finally. A reaction.</p><p>He blinked open his eyes and stretched his arms over his head, his muscles rippling. \u201cWhat?\u201d His voice was rough with sleep, utterly inviting.</p><p>How easy it would be to accept that invitation, crawl beside him, and curl into him. Damn, damn, damn. \u201cTime to go to work.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAfter my nap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow. Mia sent a car for us. And why is Hellina here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s ours now.\u201d</p><p>Ours? Like a freaking kid they\u2019d adopted? Together? Butterflies took flight in her stomach.</p><p>\u201cOh, and she\u2019s a vampire. Don\u2019t get too close to her.\u201d Lids closing, he rolled to his belly. Wouldn\u2019t you know it, his ass was perfect, even with claw marks.</p><p>And what did he mean, Hellina was a vampire? \u201cMcKell!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNap. Then sex. Then work.\u201d</p><p>First thought: Excellent plan. Second: Resist. \u201cIf you insist on staying in bed, I\u2019ll stun you and cart your carcass to AIR myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. That\u2019ll give me twenty-four hours of napping.\u201d</p><p>Speaking of stunning and twenty-four hours, how had he come out of it so soon last time? He still hadn\u2019t answered that question. \u201cNapping? Ha! Think again, you lazy bum,\u201d she said, hoping to shame him into rising. \u201cThere\u2019s too much to do.\u201d</p><p>He shaped the pillow over his head so he wouldn\u2019t have to listen to her.</p><p>Ava pressed her tongue into the roof of her mouth, then left the room in a huff. In the kitchen, she discovered her refrigerator had been stocked, and was nearly bursting with food and drinks. Her cabinets, too. And on the counter was a bowel of butterscotch candy. Real candy, not the fake stuff she could afford.</p><p>McKell\u2019s doing, she was sure. Forget lazy. He was diabolically genius. Rather than fill a glass with ice water to dump on him, she sucked on a candy\u2014like sex in her mouth, man\u2014and filled a glass with water, minus the ice.</p><p>She\u2019d already chewed and swallowed the candy by the time she reached the bedroom, glass in hand. A girl couldn\u2019t teach her man a lesson under those circumstances. So, before she did any dumping, she returned to the kitchen, unwrapped a second morsel, chewed, swallowed, unwrapped another, then finally skipped back to McKell, humming under her breath.</p><p>He still lay on his belly, that pillow over his head, the rest of him completely bare. Impervious to cold? She\u2019d soon find out. She emptied the glass directly over his shoulders, and he jumped up sputtering.</p><p>No goose bumps, but definite anger. \u201cWhat was that for?\u201d he demanded. Droplets splashed onto his stomach.</p><p>She arched a brow, praying she appeared stern rather than sated from her candy\u2014and awed by the sheer beauty of him. \u201cOh, good. You\u2019re up. We can go to work now.\u201d</p><p>He crossed his arms over his chest, his nostrils flaring with his every inhalation. Then his pupils expanded, and he grinned slowly. \u201cYou discovered the butterscotch.\u201d</p><p>Mmm, butterscotch. Would it ruin her waistline if she had one\u2014fifty\u2014more?</p><p>\u201cNap time is over, yes,\u201d he said with a husky edge, \u201cbut I believe the next item on my list was sex. And after all, you made me wet, so now it\u2019s my turn to return the favor.\u201d</p><p>A tempting proposal wrapped in such a wicked package. One thing she knew: where he was concerned, she was always wet. Not that she\u2019d admit it. Until later. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving in five minutes whether you\u2019re dressed or not. The car\u2019s been waiting for a while already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe car or the driver?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe car. There\u2019s no driver.\u201d</p><p>That kept him quiet for a minute, then he shook his head. \u201cThe car won\u2019t mind. Besides, I can love you and dress in four.\u201d</p><p>She had to turn away from him to hide her smile\u2014and her sudden surge of panic. Love. The word beat through her brain, both a paradise and a churning storm. \u201cI\u2019ll, uh, be waiting in the living room.\u201d With that, she stomped out of the bedroom and jabbed the wall console to close the door. So she wouldn\u2019t coax herself into returning. Or peeking.</p><p>Resisting, though, became harder and harder with every minute that passed. Didn\u2019t help that Hellina stared at her the entire time, fangs protruding past her bottom lip, sharp, glistening. McKell really had turned her. Un-freaking-believable.</p><p>When he finally deigned to join her, he was clean and smelled divine. Like he\u2019d slathered himself in the butterscotch bodywash. Maybe he had. Her mouth watered for another taste of him. He also wore clothing she\u2019d never seen him don before. Clothing that hadn\u2019t been in his bag. A real cotton T-shirt, too expensive for someone who made a pittance like her. Soft-looking black slacks that fit him perfectly, as if tailored exclusively for his magnificent body. Leather boots.</p><p>Holy Lord, he took her breath away.</p><p>\u201cDid you rob a bank?\u201d At the moment, they didn\u2019t look like they belonged together. They were opposites. Her, the poor good girl. Him, the rich bad boy. To his credit, he didn\u2019t seem to notice the difference. He eyed her as if she had never looked lovelier, as if she was already naked and he was already pumping inside her.</p><p>\u201cA bank? No. I robbed Devyn Targon.\u201d As he spoke, he petted Hellina behind the ears, the adoring dog licking his free hand. A domestic sight, one that had Ava\u2019s chest clenching. \u201cPerhaps robbed is the wrong word. He owed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t make him buy me clothes like yours?\u201d she demanded, hands on her hips. Had he wanted the scale to be off?</p><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s my job. Which I can now do.\u201d He could have been banging his chest, so proud did he sound. \u201cHe gave me money, too.\u201d</p><p>Wait. Backtracking. \u201cSo you\u2019ll be buying me stuff with his money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he wasn\u2019t allowed to buy me anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Fury suddenly detonated in his expression, and he stiffened, as if ready to attack. \u201cDo you want him to buy you something?\u201d</p><p>Men. \u201cNo. I just don\u2019t want to look like your poor girlfriend.\u201d Who was using him.</p><p>The fury faded, the danger passed. \u201cHaven\u2019t you realized yet? No one will ever look good enough for you.\u201d A sultry promise, seductively delivered. \u201cHow can they? You\u2019re so far above the rest of us, we can never hope to compare.\u201d</p><p>The clenching in her chest migrated to her lungs, building so much pressure that tears actually beaded in her eyes. Freaking tears. No one had ever complimented her like that before. She spun away from him, not wanting him to see. \u201cWe\u2019ll, uh, discuss this later. Right now, we need to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Later. But we will discuss it.\u201d He paused. \u201cHellina, stay,\u201d he said, then strode to the door, bypassing Ava and thankfully not looking back. He pressed the correct code, and the entrance opened. \u201cSo what would you have bought yourself?\u201d</p><p>She wiped her face and squared her shoulders, under control by the time she passed him. \u201cA kilt for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d he said as they trekked out of the building and into the car. \u201cI thought you wanted something for yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s something else for us to discuss later.\u201d The sun had disappeared, the moon taking its place, but unlike all the other nights of their association, this one was not cool and dry. Rain pounded. Dirty rain, probably acid, and enough to sting the skin.</p><p>During the drive, he told her the True Story of Hellina Tremain-McKell, How I Became a Real Vampire, and she could only shake her head in wonder. At herself! She should have known he would experiment. He wasn\u2019t the kind of man who took things at face value. He had to see for himself.</p><p>\u201cSo how do you feel?\u201d she asked. \u201cAbout being able to change, well, anything and anyone?\u201d</p><p>He stared up at the roof, at the panel revealing the constant sledgehammer of rain. \u201cRelieved, tortured, confused. Why am I able to do so, yet no one else can?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Mia mentioned something being off about your blood, but she wasn\u2019t sure what it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, like it was more than vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible. As I told you, vampires can\u2019t procreate with other species.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like your turning Hellina was impossible?\u201d</p><p>He glowered at her, dark emotion pouring off him and as toxic as the rain. \u201cMy parents were vampires. There\u2019s no ... question of that.\u201d He frowned.</p><p>That hesitation ... \u201cWhat is it? You can tell me, McKell.\u201d She reached over, squeezed his hand. \u201cYou can trust me.\u201d</p><p>He accepted the touch as if it were his right. \u201cVampires came to this planet a millennium ago, living in secret until recently, as you know. There weren\u2019t many, but they came here because their planet was dying. There were hundreds of doorways to other planets, and so the people divided, some going one way, others another, and so on. Once they crossed, the doorway closed. Until ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil\u2014,\u201d she prompted with another squeeze.</p><p>\u201cMy mother. She and my father had been wed for years with no offspring. But one day, suddenly, she disappeared. She returned a few months later, and a few months after that, she gave birth to me. For most of my childhood, I was teased, other children claiming my mother had cuckolded my father.\u201d</p><p>That kind of explained his superiority complex. He\u2019d needed to view himself as better than everyone else. Otherwise, he would have had to view himself as inferior, as everyone else had, and that was a weakness a warrior wouldn\u2019t allow.</p><p>They were more alike than she\u2019d realized.</p><p>\u201cSo, the rumors died\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I began hurting those who spoke them.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s my McKell. \u201cCould your mother manipulate time? Could anyone? You might have told me, but I\u2019m drawing a blank.\u201d</p><p>His chest puffed up. \u201cNo. I\u2019m the only one who has ever been able to do so.\u201d</p><p>So, that might not be a trait of the vampires, but of another race. Could he be more than vampire? If so, how? \u201cYour mother never spoke of another lover?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Nor did my father.\u201d</p><p>From the corner of her eye, she caught of glimpse of the structure looming in front of them. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to continue this, along with everything else, later.\u201d</p><p>He nodded as the car eased to a stop at the AIR gate. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She flashed her badge, as always, but the guards wouldn\u2019t let her through. They had to wait for Mia herself to arrive\u2014in the company of three other agents\u2014and then follow her to the back of the building.</p><p>Ava\u2019s nervous system kicked into gear as the car eased forward. \u201cLet\u2019s come up with a code word or something, in case you need my help.\u201d Maybe she shouldn\u2019t have brought him here. Maybe she should have told him to run.</p><p>He lifted her hand and licked the wild pulse in her wrist. \u201cIf I need aid, I\u2019ll say, \u2018Ava, I need you.\u2019\u201d His mouth curled up at the corners. \u201cHow\u2019s that for a code?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUnbreakable,\u201d she replied drily, trying not to squirm in her seat as she savored the soft press of his lips.</p><p>\u201cWell, I promise I won\u2019t need your help.\u201d</p><p>Her desire suddenly chilled. \u201cBecause you now think I\u2019m weak?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always think the worst of me first,\u201d he said on a sigh. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re weak. I know just how strong you really are, but I don\u2019t want you in trouble with your coworkers. Not for my sake. I\u2019ll behave.\u201d</p><p>How ... sweet. \u201cI\u2019ll\u2014I\u2019ll do better. About not thinking the worst.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Still. The nervousness returned, welcoming another round of doubts. What had she gotten him into? How would this end? \u201cJust answer Mia\u2019s questions, give her some more of your blood, and then we\u2019ll get out of here. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor you,\u201d he said, giving her hand another kiss, \u201canything.\u201d</p><p>This new, tender side of him destroyed her.</p><p>The car stopped in the underground parking lot. After sharing a long, long look, they emerged, Mia already waiting for them and tapping her foot impatiently. The other agents were still with her, pyre-guns now palmed.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not going to cause any trouble,\u201d Ava said, stepping in front of him.</p> <p>He grabbed her by the waist and shoved her behind him. Having none of that, she pulled free and returned to her favorite spot. In front, acting as his shield. A low growl left him, and he once again jerked her backward. This time, he didn\u2019t let go of her, no matter how hard she pulled.</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d Mia replied, \u201cbut it pays to be careful. Now, come on. Let\u2019s get this done.\u201d She turned to lead the way, paused, then glanced at McKell over her shoulder. \u201cOh, and thank you for the vampires you sent me, injured or not. They\u2019re recovering nicely and are currently in lockup, awaiting testing and sentencing.\u201d</p><p>He inclined his head in acknowledgment.</p><p>Mia guided them through a part of the building Ava had never been inside before. There were no other agents here, the walls and even the hallways padded, with ID scans at every turn.</p><p>\u201cMia,\u201d she said, hating the tremble in her voice. McKell still hadn\u2019t released her, so she quickened her step and twisted her wrist, twining her fingers with his rather than attempting to sever contact, hoping to offer comfort but knowing she was taking it instead. She had brought him here. Had rushed him here. If her boss meant to lock him up like she\u2019d done the others, Ava would\u2014what? Tear down the entire building? Kill every AIR agent? \u201cHe\u2019s here of his own volition. In peace. To help. Careful or not, please tell the guards to lose the guns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d was the reply. \u201cNot gonna happen.\u201d</p><p>She popped her jaw. \u201cKeep in mind, he\u2019s the only one who can help you track the Sch\u00f6n queen. You don\u2019t want to accidentally hurt him.\u201d</p><p>The threat had no effect. \u201cActually, Dallas can track her. Not to mention all my Rakans.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd none of them have done any good,\u201d she reminded her boss.</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d Mia continued with only the barest pause, \u201che hasn\u2019t been helping us, has he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe called you when he found her, didn\u2019t he? And he\u2019s been looking for ways to go out in the daylight so that he can do more.\u201d A stretching of the truth, but she didn\u2019t care. And why the hell wasn\u2019t McKell speaking up in his own defense?</p><p>She peeked up at him, blinking when she saw his smile. A genuine smile of pearly whites and amusement. He wasn\u2019t afraid. Not even a little. No, he was enjoying himself. Why?</p><p>\u201cMcKell,\u201d she said, exasperated.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop time,\u201d she whispered for his ears alone.</p><p>He did, without question. Everyone around them stilled completely. Ava stared up at him, her heart thundering in her chest. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Do you want to run or something?\u201d Though she knew, deep down, running would do no good. Not now.</p><p>\u201cRun?\u201d He laughed, the sound like a rich soothing balm. \u201cWhy would I run? You\u2019re trying to protect me. No one has ever tried to protect me before, and I ... like it.\u201d</p><p>That explained the smile. And warmed her from the inside out. Still. \u201cDon\u2019t you realize you\u2019re in danger? I can\u2019t open the doors we\u2019ve passed. We\u2019re stuck here. What if Mia\u2014\u201d</p><p>He reached up with his free hand and rasped his knuckles over her cheek. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s leading me to my death. I smell disease here. I think she means to test my blood.\u201d</p><p>Ava\u2019s stomach curdled. \u201cDisease?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, and time kicked back into gear, Mia and the guards continuing on as if they\u2019d never stopped. Ava remained quiet the rest of the way. Disease. Testing. What she\u2019d wanted, but she couldn\u2019t lose the sick feeling cramping her insides.</p><p>Finally, they reached a hallway that ended in a half circle, locked doors all around, darkened windows showcasing five different rooms.</p><p>Mia pointed, and Ava followed the line of her finger. Johnny. Shit. She\u2019d forgotten about Johnny. Now he rested on a cot in one of the rooms, probably dying, his skin gray, peeling, his cheeks sunken, his hair clumped around him, sores open and oozing all over him.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have much time left,\u201d Mia said, grim.</p><p>\u201cWhat can we do?\u201d Ava croaked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to give him McKell\u2019s blood, as we discussed.\u201d</p><p>McKell lifted his chin, nose in the air. An emperor. \u201cAva mentioned the idea to me, and I said no. I still say no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce that\u2019s done,\u201d Mia went on as if he hadn\u2019t spoken, \u201cyou have some questions to answer, McKell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuestions, fine. Blood, no.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d seemed happy with the whole thing only a few minutes before, willingly following Mia. Why the refusal now? \u201cPlease,\u201d Ava said, staring up at him.</p><p>He must have stopped time, because suddenly the rasp of Mia\u2019s breathing stopped, the guards ceased shifting from one foot to the other.</p><p>McKell gripped her shoulders and shook her. \u201cYou beg here the way you beg in bed? For this man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed to tiny slits, though that didn\u2019t hide the danger that lurked there. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you jealous? Because I thought we\u2019d gotten past that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJealous, no. You\u2019re mine, and no one and nothing will change that. But he once taunted you, embarrassed you in front of your friends. Remember? The bar? I haven\u2019t forgiven him for that.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d loved when she protected him, and she realized she loved when he defended her. He knew what others thought of her, but he didn\u2019t care. Wasn\u2019t going to change his mind about her. And that ... affected her.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, fighting those stupid tears again. \u201cEven though I understand where you\u2019re coming from, I\u2019m still asking you to heal him. Not because he deserves it, but because it\u2019s the right thing to do. And because, if he gets better, we can take turns kicking him in his man junk without any feelings of guilt.\u201d</p><p>There was a long pause, McKell studying her face every second of it. Then he nodded stiffly, and time once again propelled into motion. \u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d he said to Mia, releasing Ava.</p><p>Mia\u2019s smile was cold, hard, and determined. \u201cI never doubted you. So, let\u2019s break out the needles, dig into your vein, and then send Ava into the cell with the vial.\u201d</p><p>Ava stiffened, suddenly speechless. The last time she\u2019d been with Johnny, he\u2019d eyed her like a slab of meat. He\u2019d threatened McKell. Well, the queen had threatened McKell through him, but a threat was a threat. Yet he\u2019d been restrained. Now he was free to prowl that cell. To attack.</p><p>McKell spoke for her. Snarled, really. \u201cAva is not going in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, what?\u201d she demanded, finding her voice.</p><p>Mia anchored her hands on her hips. \u201cSomeone needs to inject Johnny or get him to drink the blood, but he attacks every doctor and agent we send in. I can\u2019t risk anyone else becoming infected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is why Ava is not going in there.\u201d Another snarl from McKell.</p><p>\u201cJohnny won\u2019t attack Ava,\u201d Mia said, confident.</p><p>McKell shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s get you a cell of your own,\u201d Mia snapped, \u201cbecause having Ava feed Johnny that blood is your only ticket out of here.\u201d</p><p>O-kay, then. \u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d Ava said before he could reply. One, she needed no more convincing, and two, as she\u2019d told McKell, it was the right thing to do. She didn\u2019t want to risk anyone else, either.</p><p>He huffed and puffed for half an hour, stopping time, pleading with her, pacing, yelling denials and demands, before finally nodding again, because she refused to back down. \u201cI\u2019ll stop time and she may enter. If he isn\u2019t immune to my ability\u2014I\u2019ve listened and eavesdropped and I know the Sch\u00f6n adapt\u2014and if I\u2019m at her side. That\u2019s the only way I\u2019ll allow this to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for your permission,\u201d Mia said dryly.</p><p>\u201cBut if anything happens to her, I will destroy you and all of AIR.\u201d</p><p>Bless his heart. \u201cShut up, McKell,\u201d she said through both a smile and a grimace. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get yourself killed. And remember our plans for later?\u201d Our bedtime plans, she silently added. \u201cI kind of need you alive.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her, hard and fast. \u201cYou belong to me, and you will take care of what\u2019s mine. As will I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d she asked, wishing she could grab on to him and never let go.</p><p>\u201cPromise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t worry,\u201d Mia said. \u201cI won\u2019t lock you away for threatening me and all those under my care. Threats don\u2019t faze me. Maybe because I\u2019m married to an alpha myself.\u201d She beckoned one of the guards, who lifted a walkie-talkie and summoned a doctor on staff to come and take that sample of McKell\u2019s blood.</p><p>She could handle this, Ava told herself. Anything to win McKell his get-out-of-jail-free card. And that\u2019s what this was. If she got hurt, that was a small price to pay.</p><p>With that thought, realization sunk deep. She wasn\u2019t just in this relationship for the short term. She more than liked the man, the vampire. And oh, shit, that stung. Panicked her all over again. Because with the knowledge, she knew she had a lot of decisions to make. Life-and-death decisions.</p><p>And the outcome might not end in her favor.</p><p>Twenty-five</p><p>To Ava\u2019s surprise, injecting Johnny with a vial of McKell\u2019s blood proved uneventful, almost anticlimactic. Especially after all that fuss. Her one-time-only former flame hadn\u2019t moved as she rushed in and out, hadn\u2019t even breathed, until the door closed behind her and McKell released him from the time-stop. Then his eyelids had popped open and he\u2019d flung himself against the window, screaming in pain. Screaming Ava\u2019s name, too, as if he could scent her, see her, and wanted to eat her alive. But Mia hadn\u2019t allowed them to stick around and watch what happened next.</p><p>And to further the surprise, Mia escorted them to the part of the building Ava was very familiar with, the interrogation wing, as promised. Without any added fuss. She waved them to their seats, then settled across from them and fired off three questions. Three. That was it, which was yet another surprise.</p><p>\u201cWill you help us hunt and kill the Sch\u00f6n queen? Off the record and without pay, of course, because you\u2019re, you know, a fugitive.\u201d</p><p>A quick \u201cyes\u201d on McKell\u2019s part.</p><p>Ava began to relax.</p><p>\u201cGood. And if you succeed, will you stick around and work for us on the record and with pay? Because, as my employee, your crimes will be expunged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what Ava wishes.\u201d</p><p>Mia arched a brow at her. \u201cAva?\u201d</p><p>Work with McKell? \u201cYes.\u201d The thought gave her a small thrill, as well as another dose of that panic. Together ... always ... Wonderful, exciting. Addicting, doomed.</p><p>Mia nodded with satisfaction, crossed her arms, then unleashed the final question. \u201cMcKell. You know I\u2019ll murder you dead if you harm another AIR agent, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d McKell replied, as unconcerned about that as he\u2019d been about everything else.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Mia grinned, a rare, genuinely amused grin. \u201cThen we\u2019re done here.\u201d</p><p>Just like that, he\u2019d been given a second chance. A real second chance, something that was as rare as Mia\u2019s smile. Ava didn\u2019t know whether to laugh, cry from sheer relief, or (accidentally) force McKell\u2019s face to interact with her fist. All that worry, suddenly wiped clean. Thank God the need for his services had superseded the need for his punishment, otherwise this would have ended a lot differently.</p><p>Finally she decided. She laughed, a hysterical sound.</p><p>Mia and McKell shot her a strange look before Mia stood and motioned to the door. \u201cOh, and Ava,\u201d she said before leaving. \u201cYou and Noelle are now officially on my team. Don\u2019t disappoint me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Wait. What? Ava barely made it to her feet. \u201cOn your ... team?\u201d Maybe Mia had said \u201cseam.\u201d Or \u201cbeam.\u201d Or even \u201ccream.\u201d Seemed too presumptuous to assume Ava had heard correctly.</p><p>McKell stood, as well, and wound an arm around her waist to hold her up.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Mia said. \u201cYou passed your trainee test, so you\u2019re hired. Now go. Get out of here. You two have a queen to find.\u201d She paused. \u201cWord of warning, though, Agent Sans. You\u2019re in charge of McKell. Which means if he messes up, hurts a civilian, you\u2019ll take the brunt of the blame. Cool?\u201d</p> <p>McKell stiffened, but the reaction didn\u2019t really register.</p><p>Agent Sans. Freaking Agent Sans. \u201cC-cool.\u201d She could only gape as Mia walked away, her mind still whirling. She was an agent. A real agent. No longer in training. This was a dream come true. Because she\u2019d done it; she\u2019d proven herself worthy.</p><p>\u201cI have to tell Noelle,\u201d she squeaked, turning in McKell\u2019s arms to face him. She was trembling uncontrollably.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations.\u201d At first, she thought he meant to kiss her. Then he canted his head to the side, his expression becoming pensive, his gaze faraway. \u201cApparently Mia called her earlier. Noelle\u2019s even waiting for us outside, a few of the trainees with her. They\u2019re supposed to help us hunt the queen.\u201d</p><p>Still in shock, head now buzzing, feeling as if she were floating, Ava fisted his shirt. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI just heard Mia inform the guards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the hallway?\u201d Ava listened and heard ... only that annoying buzz in her head, she realized. When would it stop? When would her feet settle back on the ground?</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice trick.\u201d She\u2019d just have to remember to watch her mouth whenever he was nearby. No way she wanted him to overhear her telling Noelle how sexy he was. Or anything else she might wax poetic about him.</p><p>He leaned down and nuzzled her cheek. \u201cWell, your blood makes me strong.\u201d</p><p>The reminder sobered her, and the buzzing faded. Her feet hit cold concrete. She suddenly wished they hadn\u2019t.</p> <p>One of her dreams had just come true; she\u2019d just realized how much she liked this man, maybe even wanted some kind of future with him; and yet, she still wasn\u2019t complete. With just a few words, he\u2019d put her back in her place. Blood donor. He might like her, defend her, protect her, even enjoy her, but in the end, that was the string that held them together.</p><p>Not true. You\u2019re just looking for reasons to dump him now that you know he means more to you than anyone else ever has. You\u2019re trying to find a way out of those decisions you need to make. Like turning from human to vampire. Like trusting him with her eternity. Like sharing all that she was, all that she would be. Like letting go of her fears, trusting him with not just her eternity but her heart and her concerns, believing that he felt the same and would never leave if, say, her blood no longer sustained him.</p><p>A lump grew in her throat. Maybe she was looking for reasons to dump him. Maybe not. Now wasn\u2019t the time to ponder. \u201cLet\u2019s get this hunt started, then.\u201d Suddenly cold despite the heat he radiated, she pulled from him. \u201cWe have a lot to do.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>Sweetheart. He\u2019d never called her sweetheart before, and she fell a little harder for him. What\u2019s wrong? he\u2019d asked. The truth wouldn\u2019t appeal, but neither would a lie suffice. \u201cCome on. We\u2019ll talk later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur later is already overpacked.\u201d</p><p>Very true. Still. She followed the same path Mia had taken, silent. McKell quickly caught up, silent himself, and took her hand. They strode through the building like that, like a couple. Every agent she encountered knew of her promotion and slapped her on the back, cheered, and congratulated her\u2014even the ones who had once whispered behind her back, calling her trash.</p><p>They might have been pretending to be happy for her now, though. A wee bit of jealousy radiated from some of the girls, and a tad bit of resentment wafted from some of the men. In their minds, a slutty trainee had simply seduced a target to bring him in, and she had no true skill.</p> <p>She ignored them all, still floundering and raw on the inside, and held her head high for her first true victory walk. No matter what they thought, she\u2019d done the impossible, as Mia had said. Won the vampire\u2014and kept all her fingers.</p><p>Noelle was waiting in the parking lot, just as McKell had claimed. \u201cCongratulations,\u201d she said, grinning and throwing her arms around Ava.</p><p>The hug forced her hand from McKell\u2019s. \u201cYou, too.\u201d Her tone was just as raw as her emotions.</p><p>\u201cCan you believe it? Official badasses, you and me.\u201d Noelle pulled back, her smile fading. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Why aren\u2019t you happier? I\u2019ve got trainees in the van. Our trainees! We\u2019re in charge of them now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy. I swear.\u201d</p><p>Noelle eyed her suspiciously. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdd this discussion to our list for later.\u201d McKell pulled Ava away from her friend and smashed her into the hard line of his body. His arms were as strong as always, and this time, she didn\u2019t feel so numbed against their heat. She curled into him, even though he was at the center of her turmoil. To be honest, though, he was also the center of her calm. \u201cI have an idea to begin our hunt for the queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m listening,\u201d Noelle said.</p><p>\u201cThe queen approached Dallas at his home. Therefore, we will go there, and I\u2019ll follow her scent. Wherever it leads.\u201d</p><p>Simple. Easy.</p><p>\u201cAll right. I like it.\u201d Noelle nodded. \u201cYou can follow me and the trainees\u2014our trainees,\u201d she added, grinning again.</p><p>\u201cCan do.\u201d Their vehicles were side by side, so Ava didn\u2019t have too far to walk. She climbed in, McKell beside her. A few minutes later, they were on the road and headed into ... danger?</p><p>The moon was still high, but muted, and the rain had stopped, allowing the streetlamps to illuminate his perfect features. She didn\u2019t like the thought of him in danger.</p><p>\u201cWhat about daylight vampires?\u201d she asked him. This she could do. Chat about something uncomplicated, be with him ... lust for him. Beautiful man. It was familiar. \u201cAre we giving up the search?\u201d</p><p>There was a pause, as if he debated venturing down this path. \u201cJust for now,\u201d he finally said. \u201cThey aren\u2019t the biggest threat. However, if we happen to run across one or twenty, we won\u2019t walk away. And you won\u2019t engage them without me,\u201d he added in a rush.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She\u2019d learned her lesson well. \u201cYou\u2019ll get no argument from me, promise.\u201d</p><p>He paused again, but this one was far more tense. \u201cAva.\u201d</p><p>Oh, no. Was he preparing to ask what was wrong with her again? She\u2014</p><p>\u201cTell me about yourself,\u201d he said gently. \u201cI\u2019ve tasted you, yet I know so little about your past, and I desperately want to know.\u201d</p><p>Gold star for McKell. He\u2019d just made a direct hit to her deepest, most secret longings. Maybe she was more to him. Maybe she didn\u2019t have to fear. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we trade information? I\u2019m curious about you, too.\u201d Just as desperately.</p><p>\u201cLike for like?\u201d he asked, and there was an edge of satisfaction in his voice.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cA sound plan.\u201d His violet eyes swirled. \u201cYou may begin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like to know?\u201d</p><p>Now that violet gaze roved over her, leaving heat, so much heat, in its wake. But when he next faced her, it was yearning she saw, causing her heart to skitter. \u201cWhat were you like as a child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA troublemaker, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo not much has changed.\u201d He chuckled affectionately.</p><p>She punched his shoulder, but she couldn\u2019t stop the grin lifting the corners of her lips. That grin didn\u2019t last long. She wasn\u2019t going to lie to him and dress her childhood up. He already thought humans were inferior; what would he do when he learned that she was the lowest of the low? Or rather, had been.</p><p>Finally leave her? Well, good riddance! View her as trash? Bastard! He\u2019d already heard Noelle\u2019s mother refer to her as trash, already heard Johnny refer to her as a slut, so why not confirm it for him?</p><p>That\u2019s not how McKell is with you, and you know it. You\u2019re letting your fears take over again. Stop. Now. She wasn\u2019t going to think the worst of him.</p><p>\u201cAva,\u201d he said, clearly confused. \u201cI can hear the blood rushing through your veins. Something\u2019s wrong again. Do you wish to discuss something else, then?\u201d</p><p>How accommodating he was. Part of her wished he\u2019d just grab her and jerk her onto his lap again, then kiss the breath\u2014and the words\u2014right out of her. The other part of her, the part that had resisted him from the first, finally wanted him to know everything.</p><p>\u201cI grew up in a trailer park in Whore\u2019s Corner,\u201d she said flatly. \u201cYou know, the poorest part of town. My mother was a drunk, and my dad was a convicted felon who liked to steal and use Onadyn. You\u2019ve heard of that, right? Aliens who can\u2019t breathe our air have to take it. Humans and aliens who can breathe our air use it to get wasted, even though it\u2019s illegal. My mom\u2019s many boyfriends came and went throughout the years, and they were just as vile as my dad. Users, thieves, unconcerned about those around them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid any of them hurt you?\u201d he asked, his voice as flat as hers.</p><p>That comforted her, helped her continue on. \u201cNot for lack of trying. I learned to sneak out, to stay awake. To fight. Then I met Noelle and started spending a lot of time at her place. And getting drunk. And fighting. And stealing, just like my dad. I was arrested a lot. And when I wasn\u2019t in jail, I dated boys I shouldn\u2019t have. Bad boys who didn\u2019t really care about me, yet managed to make me feel wanted, if only for a little while.\u201d</p><p>His fingertips traced the veins in her hand, soft, tender. \u201cI\u2019m glad you weren\u2019t hurt. I would have had to tear this world apart, finding each and every one of the men who had done so, and letting you cheer me on as I ripped them to shreds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust so you know, so there are no misunderstandings, I\u2014I was considered a beggar. Dirty. T-trashy.\u201d</p><p>Now he stiffened, his eyes slitting dangerously. \u201cBy who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like I\u2019ll be tearing this world apart, after all. The citizens are amazingly foolish. What you grew up with, around, doesn\u2019t define who you are. And you are the best person, human or vampire, that I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p><p>Tears. Those stupid, stupid tears were forming again, burning.</p><p>\u201cMy turn,\u201d he said, as if he hadn\u2019t just destroyed her so exquisitely. \u201cI was a beautiful child, and most everyone loved me.\u201d He peered over at her, as if waiting for a reply. What did he want her to say? She\u2019d tell him anything. Finally, though, he gave up, shoulders sagging a little, and continued. \u201cMy father was commander of the king\u2019s army, and my mother cousin to the queen. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. So you\u2019re royalty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He said it simply. As if the confirmation didn\u2019t make her want to puke.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but royalty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Isn\u2019t that wonderful?\u201d</p><p>No! \u201cGo on,\u201d she croaked out.</p><p>\u201cWell, it was clear early on that I was destined for greatness.\u201d Again he paused, waited. Again she remained silent, unsure of what he wanted to hear from her. His shoulders sagged a little more. \u201cAt a very young age, I could defeat even my father. So, I was recruited into the army. I climbed the ranks quickly, until a few years later, I was second in command.\u201d</p><p>Back to an image she could handle. McKell, kicking ass. \u201cWhat kind of battles do vampires fight in those tunnels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are a monarchy, and rebels sometimes sprout up. They must be extinguished. Also, twice a year we must leave the underground and hunt humans up here, bringing them below to be our food-slaves. I\u2019ve told you that before, haven\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Food-slaves, yes, but she hadn\u2019t realized they were hunted and incarcerated. After the Sch\u00f6n were taken care of, she and McKell might be taking a trip to those caves and freeing the \u201cfood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d he added, and his eagerness intensified her confusion. He liked sharing about himself? Well, of course, she thought next. With his past, why would he want to hide it? \u201cMy father died while fighting a nefreti.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA vampire too powerful to live. Like Bride. Remember, they possess every gift you can imagine. Mind reading, teleporting, invisibility. The nefreti killed the former king and my cousin the queen, and Manus, their oldest son, took over.\u201d</p><p>Backtracking. McKell had been engaged to Bride. She\u2019d known that. The all-powerful, wonderful Bride. She\u2019d known that, too. As Ava had told McKell earlier, she thought they were over their jealousy issues. Apparently she wasn\u2019t. Hearing him even say Bride\u2019s name made her want to sharpen her nails into dagger-points.</p><p>\u201cAs you can imagine, nefreti are difficult to kill. When my father fell, I assumed control of the army, and I\u2019ve been leading them ever since. Until recently, of course. Anyway, that was centuries ago.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes almost bugged out of her head. \u201cCenturies. You\u2019ve been alive centuries?\u201d Yeah, they\u2019d talked vampire lifespans before, but she must not have connected the dots. He was old. Experienced.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He watched her intently, gauging. \u201cDon\u2019t you see? I\u2019m strong enough to fight this queen and her disease. You have nothing to fear. I will defeat her, and all will be well with your work, your ... life.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d sensed her anxiety, she realized. No wonder he\u2019d been so eager to talk about himself. He\u2019d wanted to prove to her that she could rely on him. He was the sweetheart. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelcome.\u201d</p><p>He was soothing her, all of her. Gentling her. Oh, yes, she had a decision to make. To turn or not to turn being the most glaring. Though, after watching Johnny hit that window, she wasn\u2019t sure that was a viable option. Yet that was the only way they could connect. Truly connect.</p> <p>Forever.</p><p>Still such a scary word, but not as scary as the thought of losing him. Maybe she could do this. Maybe she could try. \u201cSo why were you kicked out of the underground?\u201d she asked, picking up their conversation.</p><p>\u201cFor allowing Bride to live. For lying to the king about who she was. For bringing her back with the intension of wedding her.\u201d</p><p>Bride again. Ugh. \u201cYou once said lying was for people who feared consequences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and I feared being without her.\u201d</p> <p>Stomach ... twisting ... Old fear alert, old fear alert, her brain screamed. She couldn\u2019t stop it, though. Bride had been his first choice. He\u2019d lied for her, given up everything for her. So what did that make Ava? Second choice? Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God. Yes, old fears. They\u2019d never really left her, she realized. They\u2019d merely waited for their chance to pounce.</p><p>She was tired of them. So tired. Which meant she had to fight them.</p><p>She squared her shoulders. \u201cDo you ever think about going back underground?\u201d</p><p>He began tracing the veins in her hand again. \u201cAt first, yes. I think some of the army would follow me, did I ask, and attack the royal house. Which would need to happen for my successful return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now? Do you want to go back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I know too many lives would be lost. Besides, I have no desire to rule the vampire world. Palace life ...\u201d He shuddered. \u201cThe balls, the deciding of everything for everyone. People constantly invading my space, touching my things. No. Unless ...\u201d He frowned. \u201cWould you like to be a queen?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Hell, no.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>A queen of vampires, each one with a special gift and lethal fangs? Her, just herself. \u201cCompletely sure.\u201d</p><p>He pushed out a relieved breath. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Had he been considering fighting his people? For her? \u201cAre you sure the king won\u2019t send that army of his to hunt you? The ones who wouldn\u2019t follow you if you returned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot completely, but he knows I could destroy them all, and I doubt he\u2019ll risk it. He hasn\u2019t yet. Now tell me a secret,\u201d he urged, leaning closer to her. \u201cSomething you haven\u2019t told anyone. Even Noelle.\u201d</p><p>The car stopped, and she peered out the window. Dallas\u2019s building came into view, and disappointment sliced through her. \u201cYet another thing for us to do later,\u201d she replied, and commanded the door to open. Not that she knew what to tell him.</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d he grumbled.</p> <p>She emerged from the driver\u2019s side and walked to the sidewalk, where Noelle and the others already waited. McKell exited, unfolding his big, strong body, and towering over everyone. Even Jeremy Deschanel, who was pale and tense. From worry about his brother? Had he even been allowed to see him?</p><p>Ava approached Jeremy and patted his shoulder in what she hoped was a comforting gesture. \u201cHe was given vampire blood,\u201d she said, and Jeremy\u2019s eyes widened. No, he hadn\u2019t been allowed to visit, and he hadn\u2019t been given an update. \u201cThere\u2019s a chance he\u2019ll heal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019s alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d His eyes squeezed shut. \u201cThank you so much. He\u2019s an asshole, but I love him.\u201d</p><p>Hard hands settled on her shoulders, tugging her away from Jeremy and into\u2014McKell. His breath was leaving him in an angry rush and lifting strands of her hair. That pleased her. She\u2019d just reacted to Bride; helped that he\u2019d reacted to Jeremy.</p><p>\u201cEveryone will remain outside,\u201d McKell said in his calm, you\u2019ll-do-it-or-die voice. \u201cI don\u2019t need your scents mingling with the ones already there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Ava circled her fingers around his wrist, holding him to her. \u201cNoelle and I are in charge of tonight\u2019s activities, so we\u2019ll tell them what to do.\u201d Her narrowed gaze swept over the trainees, and some of them glared at her resentfully. She\u2019d made it, after all, and they hadn\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019ve decided. You\u2019ll all stay out here.\u201d\u2019</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep them in line,\u201d Noelle said with relish. \u201cOh, and here.\u201d She handed Ava a digital info-pad as she faced him. \u201cYou\u2019ll need this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive her any trouble,\u201d McKell said, \u201cand I will personally remove your fingers.\u201d He pulled his necklace from under his shirt, the bones clinking together as they fell back to his chest.</p><p>\u201cNow, then. I\u2019m going with you,\u201d Ava told him, grip tightening on the pad as she faced him.</p><p>He arched a dark brow, looking sardonic and amused at the same time. \u201cOne day you\u2019ll have to learn to obey me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, but that day isn\u2019t today.\u201d She urged him forward. Behind her, someone muttered, \u201cHe really is an ass, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Ava stilled. Oxygen suddenly burned her throat, her muscles clenching in fury, red dots dancing through her line of vision. She whipped around, a knife in her hand, though she didn\u2019t recall withdrawing it.</p><p>\u201cWho said that?\u201d she demanded through gritted teeth.</p><p>Noelle pointed to the male trainee standing beside Jeremy. \u201cLittle boy, you\u2019re in trouble now,\u201d her friend sang.</p><p>Following those red dots, which formed a path straight to her target, Ava stalked forward. Until McKell\u2019s hard hands once again settled on her shoulders, stopping her.</p><p>She fought for release. \u201cI will murder you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need, sweetheart,\u201d McKell said, and he sounded happier than she\u2019d ever heard him. \u201cI\u2019m not offended by the comment.\u201d</p><p>Why was he happy? Not that his happiness would have prevented her from attacking. No, it was the \u201csweetheart\u201d that calmed her. She\u2019d never liked endearments before. They encouraged affection she rarely entertained. Yet ... when he did it ... rainbows and gumdrop trees always seemed to sprout in her mind.</p><p>\u201cHe needs to suffer,\u201d she huffed.</p><p>\u201cLater.\u201d McKell spun her around and anchored his arm on her waist, forcing her into the building. Along the way, he maneuvered her to the left, into grass, and ushered her around\u2014nothing. She was confused, but didn\u2019t question him.</p><p>Dallas lived on the fourteenth floor, and Noelle\u2019s digital pad gave them the pass-code to enter his apartment. Which was dirty as hell. Had gossip not warned her about the mess, she would have thought someone had broken in and trashed the place.</p><p>McKell grimaced. \u201cThe bitch has been all over this apartment. It reeks of her disease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you smell her outside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Nor did I smell her in the hallway. Which means she\u2019s teleporting rather than using invisibility.\u201d</p><p>Fabulous. \u201cCan you follow someone who teleports?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Extra fabulous. \u201cThis was a waste of time, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot necessarily.\u201d He hustled her outside. Without a word, he helped her back into the car.</p><p>Noelle sputtered for answers as she shepherded the trainees back into their van. Answers McKell didn\u2019t give. Not even when Ava demanded them. The car once again sped along the roads, and this time, Noelle followed them. They didn\u2019t stop until they reached the bar where the queen had first appeared to Dallas.</p><p>Again McKell emerged, and again he tugged Ava along silently. Noelle and the trainees trekked a safe distance behind, acting as bodyguards rather than detectives. A few more blocks, another snaked corner, several instances of him frowning, pushing her away from what seemed to be a perfectly fine patch of air, and he stopped, looked around.</p><p>\u201cThis is where she approached Johnny.\u201d</p><p>He kicked back into motion, sniffing all the while. Another block, three corners, four more pushes out of the way, constant mumbling about \u201cstupid doorways,\u201d and they reached another apartment building. Johnny\u2019s. Ava knew because she\u2019d been there. Which had her ducking her head and praying McKell\u2019s sniffing ability wasn\u2019t that keen.</p><p>Without any prompting, he led her to Johnny\u2019s apartment and shouldered past the door. Clean, sparse, with not many personal effects. As if he wanted to be able to pick up and move at any time.</p><p>McKell walked through every inch, then returned to the bedroom. Ava wanted to do more than duck, but all he said was, \u201cThe queen teleported out of here, too, but her guards didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. Johnny hadn\u2019t mentioned guards, but then, maybe Johnny hadn\u2019t seen them. \u201cSo these guards weren\u2019t at Dallas\u2019s place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were guards there, yes, but he injured them and they were carted to AIR, so their scents were useless. The ones that were here walked out. They were most likely invisible, since no one saw them, but they still had to walk out.\u201d He grinned slowly. \u201cWhich means we can follow them. Straight to their queen.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-six</p><p>Dallas sprawled in his hospital bed, healed enough to go home, yet not quite ready to leave. He\u2019d had nothing to do but watch time tick away, then listen to the monitors beeping in tune to his heart; and when those started to bore him\u2014like, within minutes\u2014he\u2019d only been able to think about his beautiful Sch\u00f6n queen.</p><p>His? He immediately chided himself. Never his. Bitch was a stone-cold killer. And while he usually admired that quality in a woman\u2014he\u2019d been known to date porn stars, emotionally bankrupt heiresses, and the coldest of ice princesses\u2014he wasn\u2019t a fan of rampant disease.</p><p>Here\u2019s what he knew. Trinity was a woman who took what she wanted, damn the consequences. Proof: she infected men, kept the ones she liked, and discarded the rest, letting them fend for themselves and infect others. Proof: she ruined one planet and then quickly moved on to another one. Proof: she claimed to like Dallas, to desire him, yet she\u2019d allowed him to be shot rather than take the rays herself.</p><p>So, if she was so selfish and self-indulged, that begged the question of why she hadn\u2019t just infected him, since that\u2019s what she so badly wanted to do. Only one answer made sense. She couldn\u2019t. Physically, emotionally, whatever the reason, she needed his cooperation to act. Through seduction or manipulation, she needed him to say yes. Had to have that yes.</p><p>It was so clear now. Trinity was woman, disease\u2014and followers. Three, as he\u2019d suspected, but without that yes, she was stuck. Unable to harm him. Which meant he finally had what he\u2019d been searching for: a weakness.</p><p>How could he exploit it, though?</p><p>If she would appear before him, solidify again, he could wear one of AIR\u2019s Night-Night rings. The rings looked innocent, but when you moved the stone in the center, there was a tiny needle that\u2014needle. The word chilled his blood.</p><p>Injecting her, even with so tiny a needle, could have devastating results. For him, for all of AIR. The rings weren\u2019t like the darts, and didn\u2019t cauterize the wound. If one little bead of her blood spilled\u2014and it would, because the Sch\u00f6n disease always knew when an escape hatch, for lack of a better term, appeared, always knew when a new host was nearby ...</p><p>Some of AIR\u2019s finest had been infected that way while first testing the Sch\u00f6n.</p><p>A thought suddenly crimped his newest theory about Trinity needing a yes before doing her dirty work. The doctors hadn\u2019t willingly agreed to be infected, yet they had succumbed.</p><p>Or maybe they had welcomed the virus. Unintentionally, of course. The virus was alien, alive, and could have whispered to them, tricked them.</p><p>\u201cUp and at \u2018em, I see.\u201d</p><p>Dallas pulled himself from his contemplations to eye the speaker. Mia. She stood beside his bed, grinning, all her pearly whites showing. She was a walking contradiction, and years ago he\u2019d thought himself in love with her. He\u2019d promised himself he would never think about those dark years, when he\u2019d watched her, wanted her, but she\u2019d kept him firmly in the friend zone, and he\u2019d never gone back on his word. Until now. He blamed the painkillers pumping through his system.</p><p>Noelle Tremain was a lot like her, he thought. Pretty, yet tough as fucking nails. Maybe that\u2019s why he\u2019d eventually sleep with Noelle and end his friendship with Hector. Maybe he\u2019d be pretending she was Mia.</p><p>Thought you were going to stay away from Noelle from now on.</p><p>I bet she gives amazing TLC.</p><p>Even in his sad condition, his body reacted to that thought.</p><p>Don\u2019t throw a love triangle into the cluster-fuck of your life right now. You\u2019ve got too much to worry about. Hector had stopped by to see him multiple times, and Dallas had almost broken down and asked the guy what he thought of the new agent. He\u2019d kept his mouth shut, though. They all had too much to worry about.</p><p>\u201cIgnoring me?\u201d Mia asked, fake grin fading. Yeah, he\u2019d known it was fake. What he didn\u2019t know was why. \u201cOr has your abused brain finally given up and withered away completely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said in greeting. \u201cAnd the brain\u2019s just fine, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see that chest.\u201d Without waiting for his permission, she removed the bandage covering his wound. She whistled under her teeth. \u201cThat\u2019s gonna leave the cutest little scar.\u201d</p><p>If by \u201ccutest little scar\u201d she meant \u201cmountainous crater,\u201d then, yeah. It was.</p><p>A knock sounded at the door, and Dallas shifted his gaze. As if his earlier thoughts had summoned him, Hector entered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI brought you a cupcake from the bakery downstairs.\u201d Hector extended his untattooed hand as he approached the bed.

Sorry.\u201d</p> <p>Dallas flipped him off, then tossed the wrapper at him. \u201cSo what\u2019s going on?\u201d And something was definitely going on. Despite the smiles and the \u201cgifts,\u201d both radiated a tension they couldn\u2019t hide.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Mia began, putting his bandage back in place.</p><p>\u201cHello, hello. I brought my handsome boy some flowers,\u201d Devyn said from the doorway, seizing center stage.</p><p>A reunion. Great. \u201cDon\u2019t they have a limit on the number of people I can have in my room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey sure do,\u201d Devyn said with a nod. \u201cGive me a minute to get rid of everyone for you.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019d do it, too. Force everyone to leave by controlling their bodies. Devyn never cared who he pissed off, and Dallas had always loved that about him. \u201cThey can stay. You can stay. Will someone just tell me what the hell is going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a minute,\u201d his best friend said. \u201cWhen your attitude has improved.\u201d</p><p>Please. Like he could improve. \u201cSo where are the flowers?\u201d he asked, noticing Devyn\u2019s hands were empty.</p><p>\u201cOh. I gave them to a nurse.\u201d</p><p>Dallas rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Devyn said, all innocence. \u201cShe looked sad.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMia?\u201d Dallas focused on her. \u201cYou were saying?\u201d</p><p>She turned and kicked the door shut, then jammed the crash cart in front of it, ensuring no one else would enter. When she straightened, she rubbed her hands in a job well done.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so,\u201d she began again.</p><p>\u201cWait. I need to get comfortable.\u201d Devyn grabbed the only chair in the room, moved it to Dallas\u2019s other side, and plopped down. He waved his hand, a king before his court. \u201cContinue.\u201d</p><p>Mia popped her jaw. To Dallas\u2019s surprise, she didn\u2019t give the Targon shit, just started up again. \u201cWe gave Johnny some of McKell\u2019s blood. We hoped it would kill the Sch\u00f6n disease, and maybe it did. After a terrible first reaction, Johnny seems to be better. Looks one hundred percent better. Except ...\u201d</p><p>Again, she shifted from one foot to the other, and looked over at Hector.</p><p>He nodded and picked up where she\u2019d left off. \u201cExcept he\u2019s now obsessed with Ava.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObsessed, how?\u201d Dallas asked.</p> <p>\u201cHe screams for her. Constantly. He wants to drink from her. He bangs at the window in his room to get to her, and has managed to crack the supposedly uncrackable shield armor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about starving him?\u201d Devyn asked. \u201cThat\u2019ll weaken him, right?\u201d</p><p>He knew a thing or two about vampires, Dallas supposed.</p><p>Mia tugged at the short length of her ponytail. \u201cWhen we noticed he was healing, and by that I mean looking human again, we threw bags of blood in his room, and at first he digested them just fine, but then he started vomiting the blood.\u201d</p><p>What did that\u2014</p><p>\u201cWhich means he\u2019s encountered his mate,\u201d Devyn said with a nod. \u201cAva. Which is why he calls for her. He won\u2019t be able to keep anyone\u2019s blood down but hers. He\u2019ll weaken whether you feed him or not.\u201d</p><p>Hello, complication. \u201cThat\u2019s gonna piss McKell off.\u201d Dallas had only been around the pair the once, but that had been enough. The connection between them was fierce and almost frightening. The vampire would allow no one to get between him and his woman.</p><p>\u201cWe knew Johnny had a crush on Ava,\u201d Mia said, and there was guilt in her tone because she\u2019d encouraged that crush for results, \u201cbut that wouldn\u2019t explain his intense desire for her. We think it\u2019s because McKell\u2019s blood changed him. We think McKell\u2019s desire for her transferred to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, someone has to warn McKell,\u201d Dallas said.</p><p>\u201cNot it,\u201d Mia said, and Hector and Devyn quickly followed with refusals of their own.</p><p>What were they, five-year-olds? \u201cFine. The cripple will do it.\u201d Dallas offered each of them his darkest frown.</p><p>That earned him an \u201cAwesome,\u201d from Devyn, and a huge smile of thanks from Mia and Hector.</p><p>\u201cBut in the meantime,\u201d he went on, thinking they all needed a good slap on the head, \u201cwe have to find out if Johnny\u2019s still infected or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree, but we\u2019re afraid to test him,\u201d Mia admitted. \u201cHe\u2019s wild, strong.\u201d</p><p>McKell could stop time. Stop Johnny. Kill him, just in case, so they wouldn\u2019t have to worry about testing him, but that wouldn\u2019t give them any answers.</p><p>Dallas fell back on his bed, moving away from thoughts of Johnny\u2019s death and concentrating on Trinity\u2019s. McKell could probably stop time for Trinity. And if McKell could stop her, just for a few seconds, Dallas could\u2014what? He would have to kill her without cutting her. Maybe he could snap her neck. Would she heal?</p><p>Hector could atomize his right arm and reach inside her body. Maybe good ole Hec could reach inside Trinity\u2019s chest and stop her heart. Would that put him in contact with her blood, though? Willingly? Probably. So maybe Dallas could\u2014the scent of roses filled his nose.</p><p>Cursing, he forced his mind to blank. He\u2019d suspected Trinity could read minds; she\u2019d even told him she could. And he knew damn good and well she could enter a room without anyone the wiser. She might have just popped in, might be reading him even then. Invisible, planning. He\u2019d have to be careful.</p><p>\u201cGuys,\u201d he said. \u201cI need you all to leave now. Don\u2019t talk about any of this with anyone. Don\u2019t even think about it. The queen, Trinity, can pop in, listen, and even read minds.\u201d Understand what I\u2019m saying.</p><p>Grim silence followed his announcement.</p><p>\u201cAnything we do from here on out needs to be spontaneous. Feel me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Mia said, fingering her ponytail again. A cute, nervous habit.</p><p>\u201cMy mind only ever goes to Bride, anyway,\u201d Devyn said with a shrug, \u201cso that won\u2019t be a problem for me.\u201d</p><p>Spontaneous was going to be a problem for everyone else, though. How could they work together, how could they help each other, if they didn\u2019t know what the other agents were doing?</p><p>\u201cWell, shit,\u201d Mia repeated. \u201cThis is gonna be a whole lot of fun.\u201d She patted him on the shoulder before dragging Hector out of the room. \u201cCome on. We got stuff to do. Or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant me to stay and read you a bedtime story?\u201d Devyn asked. \u201cOr I can share the painkillers I took from that nurse. You know, the one who has your flowers.\u201d He reached in his pocket and withdrew a handful of white pills.</p><p>\u201cI thought you gave her the flowers because she looked sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did look sad. After she realized someone had stolen all her drugs.\u201d</p><p>Despite the harsh reality they faced, Dallas found himself laughing. \u201cGet out of here, you bastard. Dally needs to not think about what to do next.\u201d</p><p>Devyn stood, then leaned down as if to kiss him. On the mouth. Dallas blinked, unsure how to handle the situation. Just before contact, Devyn grinned and straightened, saying, \u201cYou wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJackass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you have called me if I\u2019d actually done it? Sweetheart? Well, you\u2019ll just have to get better without having me kiss your boo-boos.\u201d He was laughing as he exited the room.</p><p>Alone again. Dallas should have been able to relax. Only, he could suddenly feel the queen\u2019s eyes on him. They bored into him, deep into his soul, and caused every muscle in his body, even the still-injured ones, to tense.</p><p>She really was here.</p><p>How long had she been there? What had she heard?</p><p>His gaze flew through the room, searching, before he said, \u201cYou can come out now.\u201d</p><p>She appeared in the chair Devyn had just vacated, a vision of loveliness in a cobalt-colored robe that revealed one delicate shoulder. Her hair was red today, and piled high on her head, ringlets falling down to frame her temples.</p><p>There was something else different about her this visit. She was as beautiful as ever, and yet he could somehow see past that beauty, to sickeningly gray skin, oozing sores, and concave cheeks.</p><p>Was her own disease destroying her? Was infecting others no longer saving her?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not playing fair,\u201d she said with an angry twinge.</p><p>Fair? He wasn\u2019t playing fair? \u201cHow?\u201d Mind blank.</p><p>\u201cPlanning to shield your thoughts, to act against me randomly.\u201d</p><p>His hands clenched on the bars at the side of his bed. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to survive. Surely you can understand that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I can. That doesn\u2019t mean I have to like it.\u201d She leaned forward and traced a finger along his bandaged sternum. \u201cHave you thought about my offer?\u201d</p><p>Mind blank. No reaction. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Her lashes lifted, and her gaze met his, hard, determined. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I won\u2019t let you infect me. I won\u2019t talk to Mia for you.\u201d</p><p>He expected her to erupt, to strike at him, something, but all she did was fall back into her chair, severing contact. She drummed her fingers against the arms.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never encountered this much resistance before, and I admit I\u2019m at a loss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in what\u2019s called a Mexican standoff, baby, so one of us has to cave. On something. And it\u2019s not going to be me. So tell me what you want with Mia, and we can go from there.\u201d</p><p>That sunken gaze hardened a little more. \u201cI could just kill more agents of yours as I planned.\u201d Cold, so cold. \u201cI believe I promised to visit the vampire next.\u201d</p><p>Mind fucking blank. \u201cBut you won\u2019t because you realize that will only cause me to resist you more intently.\u201d</p><p>Trinity sighed. \u201cVery well. I will tell you ... something I want ... and that is ... Mia\u2019s body.\u201d She watched him, waiting.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t mask his surprise. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Trinity licked her lips. \u201cI want to possess it.\u201d</p><p>Sexually? \u201cStill don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>She tensed. He thought she meant to leave, but she surprised him by saying, \u201cEvery time I go to a new planet, I need a new body. One already adjusted to the temperature, the atmosphere, the ... everything. My ... essence leaves the old one and enters the new.\u201d</p><p>Now they were getting somewhere. \u201cWhat would happen to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer essence would enter the body I left behind.\u201d</p><p>Not good. Not good at all. \u201cSo how does the disease follow you? I mean, there would be no blood exchange in essence-switching, right?\u201d God, he couldn\u2019t believe he was discussing essence-switching, whatever the hell that was, as easily as if they were discussing switching T-shirts.</p><p>She flashed her teeth. White, sharp, almost sharklike. \u201cMy essence is the disease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what? You\u2019d take over her body and no one would know Mia was actually you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they\u2019d follow you,\u201d he said, finally understanding. With understanding came a sick, cramping stomach. \u201cThey\u2019d do whatever you said, thinking you were their beloved leader.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. That\u2019s the way it always goes. And by the time they realize something\u2019s different, wrong, they\u2019re already infected and serving me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCold,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNecessary,\u201d she countered.</p><p>\u201cSelfish.\u201d By telling him now, she\u2019d ruined the element of surprise.</p><p>Gray cheeks pinkened with fury. \u201cNo different from anyone else. We all do what we must to survive. Didn\u2019t you just say that?\u201d</p><p>Before he could reply, a sharp pain exploded through his temple, and he grimaced. Damn it. He knew what that pain meant. A vision of the future wanted to open up in his mind. He fought it, held it back, because he didn\u2019t want Trinity seeing it, whatever it was.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find a way to stop you,\u201d he gritted out.</p><p>She sighed, a little sad. A trick, surely. \u201cNo, you won\u2019t. I\u2019ll have this planet as I\u2019ve had so many others. I will stop AIR before they can hinder me in any way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you want more than anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I want ... I want a cure.\u201d One confession making way for another?</p><p>Another trick. She enjoyed what she did, the power she wielded. \u201cAnd if the only cure is death?\u201d</p><p>The sadness melted away, revealing her true emotion. Calculation. \u201cI wanted to rule this planet with you,\u201d she said, refusing to answer. \u201cI like you, but again, you\u2019ve given me no choice. I will find someone other than Mia. Someone who will willingly trade bodies with me.\u201d</p><p>So. She\u2019d sensed his long-ago desire for Mia and had thought to use it against him. \u201cThere\u2019s no one who would do anything so stupid.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, the calculation giving away to another wave of sadness. He simply couldn\u2019t keep up with her mood changes. \u201cSomeone is always willing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot here. Not on Earth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove is all the motivation people need. I threaten one of their loved ones, and they give me whatever I want.\u201d</p><p>The sickness intensified, but like the vision, he beat it back. \u201cThen why didn\u2019t you threaten Kyrin, the man Mia loves?\u201d He knew he wasn\u2019t planting ideas into Trinity\u2019s head. He knew she\u2019d considered all the angles, all the players. \u201cWhy did you threaten me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Slowly she eased to her feet, peering down at him. \u201cI told you. Because I like you. And because Kyrin is a man so deeply in love he would kill himself before allowing himself to become a weapon used against his woman. If he died, Mia would never agree to anything I asked.\u201d</p><p>Or maybe Trinity simply couldn\u2019t infect Kyrin.</p><p>A muscle twitched under her eye. Had she read that thought? \u201cThere are other couples within AIR that might be willing to bargain.\u201d</p> <p>Mind blank. No reaction. \u201cLike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike time will tell, sweet Dallas.\u201d She didn\u2019t wait for his reply. She disappeared.</p><p>Fuck. Dallas leapt from the bed, but before he\u2019d taken a single step, his vision busted past his mental block and slammed into vivid focus. Ava and Noelle, fighting the Sch\u00f6n. Ava, falling. Blood spilling. Her body, motionless. Her ... death.</p><p>Unchangeable.</p><p>Fuck, fuck, fuck! He was panting as he came back to the present. He couldn\u2019t tell her, he thought. He couldn\u2019t risk being the one to drive her to that point. That had happened to him before. He\u2019d had a vision, done everything in his power to stop it, but because of his actions, the vision had come true.</p> <p>So, while there was nothing he could do for Ava\u2014damn it!\u2014there was something he could do about Trinity\u2019s threat. Dallas raced from the room, uncaring that his hospital gown was split in back and revealed every inch of his bare ass. He was going to contact every fucking AIR agent who was dating, married, or in love and warn them. Which meant he had to contact every AIR agent working for Mia. Even Ava. Before it was too late for the rest of them.</p><p>Twenty-seven</p><p>McKell found himself standing in front of the most exclusive apartment building in New Chicago, a towering monstrosity of gold-veined marble and rising columns. Mia and Kyrin lived in the penthouse\u2014and that\u2019s where the Sch\u00f6n queen\u2019s men had visited after leaving Johnny\u2019s.</p><p>Had Mia and Kyrin known? McKell wondered. He didn\u2019t think so, or hardass Mia would have thrown a fit all the city would have heard about.</p><p>Those men hadn\u2019t lingered for long, though, and had next visited ... Devyn and Bride\u2019s city house a few miles away. McKell positioned himself outside the closed gates with Ava tucked safely beside him, the rest of the gang remaining about a yard behind. Silent, he stared at the mansion on the hill, certain the otherworlder and vampire hadn\u2019t known about their visitors, either.</p><p>The Sch\u00f6n bitch had certainly made the rounds. How many agents had she watched?</p> <p>Thankfully, the stink of rot that followed her and her men created a very clear path. A path he had to walk, just as they had, that glimmering doorway popping up every ten minutes. So. Annoying. Ava kept up beautifully, though she called him all kinds of bad names for dragging her, walking too swiftly, and stopping too abruptly.</p><p>He loved when she called him names. Meant she cared for him with the same intensity she cared for Noelle. That she was comfortable with him, that she trusted him. At least, that\u2019s what he told himself. And as he was most often right ...</p><p>He didn\u2019t even mind the other agents tagging along. Even Jeremy. Every time McKell released Ava to study something, that boy would close in on her. To shield her\u2014and as selfish and unwilling to share as McKell was, he found that he didn\u2019t mind that someone coveted something of his because Ava\u2019s protection came first.</p><p>Of course, the fact that Ava was in danger at all had his nails elongating and his teeth sharpening. He wanted this case over, done. Didn\u2019t help that the doorway was appearing more frequently now, harriedly breathing his name. So far, he\u2019d managed to keep Ava away from it. What did it want? What was its purpose?</p><p>\u201cWhatever pissed you off,\u201d Ava said, \u201cdial it down a notch, \u2018em kay? You\u2019ve already taken the fun out of my hunt. The way you\u2019re cutting my palm with your nails is going to take the fun out of your morning. You know, when we get home. After our talk, and before our nap.\u201d</p><p>Home, she\u2019d said. Theirs. He immediately loosened his grip. \u201cJust one more stop, then, and if the queen isn\u2019t there, we\u2019ll pick up where we left off tomorrow night.\u201d The sun would rise soon, anyway, and McKell would have to move indoors.</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d</p><p>Only a block later, Ava said, \u201cWait.\u201d She pulled from his grip and withdrew her phone. She frowned as she read the screen. \u201cJust got a text from Dallas. The Sch\u00f6n queen plans to target a couple. She\u2019ll threaten one so the other will do whatever she wants. He says she can read minds, so we aren\u2019t to think about what we would do to her if that happens.\u201d</p> <p>A mind reader. Wonderful. Exactly what they\u2019d needed to add to the equation.</p><p>\u201cShe already threatened you. I wonder if this means she changed her mind.\u201d Ava pocketed her phone, and they picked up speed. Soon they were back in the heart of the city, people strolling along the sidewalks, shop lights flashing, but two corners later, he tensed, tendrils of rage nearly choking him.</p><p>He recognized this neighborhood.</p><p>\u201cDecide to call it a night already?\u201d Ava asked, recognizing it as well. She should, since she lived here.</p><p>If the scent led to her door, he would ... do anything, he realized. Anything to stop the queen. Drain humans to remain in the sunlight. Yes. No matter how much of a hypocrite that made him. He wouldn\u2019t sleep until the queen was dead.</p><p>\u201cMcKell?\u201d Ava prompted.</p><p>Another yard, and they would be standing in front of their apartment building. Dread filled him, mixed with rage, and he slowed his steps. Little by little, his feet ate up that yard until\u2014a low growl rose from deep within. No, the queen hadn\u2019t changed her mind about him.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t smelled her disgusting scent in Ava\u2019s building before. That meant the first visit had been today. Did that also mean he and Ava were the targeted couple Dallas had mentioned?</p><p>\u201cMcKell?\u201d Ava insisted. \u201cWe done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was here,\u201d he gritted out. \u201cShe came to our home.\u201d</p><p>Silence. Now Ava tightened her grip on him, her nails cutting his skin.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d Noelle asked, coming up behind them. \u201cI was eavesdropping and heard what you said to each other, so no need to explain. Plus, I got Dallas\u2019s text, too.\u201d The trainees were close on her heels.</p><p>What did he want to do? He wanted to keep searching, that\u2019s what. Things were personal now. This was war. Resting wasn\u2019t an option.</p><p>\u201cCount me in on the eavesdropping, too,\u201d Jeremy said. \u201cIf she\u2019s been here, I don\u2019t think Ava should stay here. Not that my vote matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you agree with me, it counts. Now. Not another word out loud,\u201d McKell snapped. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about what we should next do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember, the queen can read minds,\u201d Ava said with a tremor. She leaned her head on his shoulder. \u201cBut the thing is, we can\u2019t leave Hellina in there alone. We have to get her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get her,\u201d he said, then kissed the top of her head.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she rushed out. \u201cShe, the queen\u2014\u201d She pressed her lips together, flicked him a glance, looked away. \u201cI can\u2019t say it. Can\u2019t think about it. Sorry. Just, let me do it. I\u2019ll get the dog. Okay?\u201d</p><p>McKell inhaled deeply, trying not to think or plan or panic. Along with the sweet scent of butterscotch from Ava, he discovered an increase of rot. He stiffened. Were the queen and her men here, even now?</p><p>And, damn it. Wouldn\u2019t you know it. The doorway opened, air churning wildly.</p><p>\u201cWhat you just said, about not thinking, not talking.\u201d He forced her to look up at him, noses almost touching. \u201cTake the others to AIR headquarters. Now. I\u2019ll grab Hellina and follow.\u201d</p><p>Truth or lie, he didn\u2019t know. He only knew that he had to keep his mind clear, not plan, just act on instinct. Hopefully Ava would do the same, obey him or not, without thinking about it.</p><p>Ava opened her mouth\u2014to argue?\u2014but closed it with a snap. Wariness clouded her lovely dark eyes. So did worry. But darling that she was, she nodded. Trusting him. \u201cBe careful,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou, too. Do nothing to put yourself in harm\u2019s way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe van is just around the corner. I had one of the guys follow us,\u201d Noelle said, and the group marched off. She had to tug Ava along, though.</p><p>Ava\u2019s gaze remained on McKell until the last possible second. He stayed where he was, sniffing, ensuring that the queen\u2014or her men, whoever\u2014didn\u2019t leave with the others. The scent of rot never lessened, so he knew the queen had stayed with him.</p><p>\u201cYou might as well come out of hiding,\u201d he said, scanning the darkness. The command agitated the doorway, the churning now so frantic a hard breeze hit him.</p><p>A laugh echoed a split second before a woman appeared out of nowhere, leaning against the cracked brick of Ava\u2019s building. Red curls hung down her back, and she wore another robe, this one blue and streaked with dirt. In fact, there was dirt on her face and arms, too.</p><p>Not a single guard appeared. Did that mean they were still hiding, or that they weren\u2019t even here?</p><p>McKell. Come. Never had the doorway sounded more desperate.</p><p>No, he projected. Never.</p><p>\u201cI like you, McKell,\u201d the queen said, seemingly oblivious.</p><p>Like everyone else, she probably was. \u201cI can\u2019t say the same about you.\u201d</p><p>McKell. Please.</p><p>I hear nothing. Know nothing. \u201cI don\u2019t like that you came here. I don\u2019t like that you stalked my woman. And do you know what I do to people I don\u2019t like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hurt them,\u201d she replied with a smile.</p><p>Please! Now.</p><p>Silence, ignornace. \u201cYes.\u201d He lifted the necklace he wore, the human bones clinking together. \u201cYour fingers would look nice resting beside the others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cannot hurt me,\u201d she said confidently. \u201cYou can\u2019t make me bleed without severe consequences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are other ways,\u201d he said. Don\u2019t consider them, he reminded himself. \u201cAnd I guess it\u2019s up to me to save the day. I\u2019d prefer you left this planet, but if I have to kill you and everyone who serves you to do it, that\u2019ll just be a bonus.\u201d</p><p>McKell. The danger ... too great ...</p><p>Another feminine laugh chimed from her. \u201cOthers have tried to scare me away, too. Ask me if they succeeded.\u201d</p><p>Such smugness. He should choke the life from her. In fact, nothing was stopping him from doing so. He closed the distance between them, and if she knew what he planned, she didn\u2019t react. Not even when he reached out and wrapped his big hands around her small throat. \u201cLeave, or you will die.\u201d</p><p>McKell!</p><p>Wind danced the strands of his hair together.</p><p>Unaffected, she said, \u201cYou think you\u2019ll be the one to finally fell me? You think there\u2019ll be no consequences for doing so? You think my men won\u2019t want revenge? You think I\u2019m not the only reason Ava\u2019s alive, right. This. Second?\u201d</p><p>Her threats ... He tightened his grip, relaxed his grip.</p><p>Danger, so much danger.</p><p>\u201cThe moment I\u2019m dead, they\u2019ll attack your girlfriend first,\u201d she continued, voice strong, as if his lethal intention meant nothing. The wind kicked up. \u201cThere\u2019s so many of them, you won\u2019t be able to stop them all. Won\u2019t be able to get to her fast enough. Not even with your ability. We adapt to abilities such as yours, after all. We learn to override them. Do you really want to risk that? What if we\u2019ve already adapted?\u201d</p><p>Intimidation. He\u2019d used that tactic himself. When it came to Ava\u2019s well being, however, he had no defenses.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and freeze time,\u201d the queen said, taunting now. \u201cSee if I lie. Only, know that the moment you do so, I will consider this little truce over.\u201d</p><p>Truce? She called this a truce? \u201cWhat do you want from me, female?\u201d God, the wind. If the queen didn\u2019t kill him, the mind just might.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised Dallas didn\u2019t tell you, didn\u2019t try to help you figure out how to deal with me.\u201d The grin returned. \u201cMaybe he wants you to fail.\u201d</p><p>If you won\u2019t come with me, leave the area.</p><p>Can\u2019t leave Ava with such a threat hanging over her head. McKell\u2019s eyes narrowed. Damn it. No more communicating with the door.</p><p>\u201cSo ... how much do you love your Ava?\u201d she asked silkily.</p><p>The sun was slowly rising, warming the restless air, heating his skin. Beads of sweat formed on his brow, and he could feel blisters already trying to form on the back of his neck. Not by word or deed did he act as if he was bothered, though. \u201cI don\u2019t. Love her, that is.\u201d True or not, he didn\u2019t know, but he wouldn\u2019t think about his feelings for her right now. He couldn\u2019t. Too much was at stake.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you be willing to do to save her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, you will never know, because you won\u2019t touch her.\u201d His hands fell to his sides, fisted. Just like that, the wind died.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I already have.\u201d</p><p>That. Was. It. The need to act exploded through him. She claimed her men would attack Ava the moment McKell killed her. She claimed he wouldn\u2019t be able to reach Ava in time. Could be lies. Could be truth. Either way, he couldn\u2019t allow this woman to walk away.</p><p>Ava was in danger either way. If the queen died, she had a chance. If the queen lived, she didn\u2019t, and that was where this Sch\u00f6n had made her biggest mistake. Anything else, and he might have walked away.</p><p>With only a thought, McKell froze time. Froze the queen, as well. And she was frozen, he was sure of it. She didn\u2019t move as he once again wrapped his hands around her neck, as he squeezed hard enough to smash her trachea.</p><p>Oh, McKell. No, the doorway said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Except, before he could snap her neck, she broke free of his hold. Both physically and time-wise, throwing herself backward, gasping for air. Her skin was pallid, revealing the thick gray of her veins. Clearly, no mask. The sores he\u2019d only glimpsed before popped up all over her, and he could see where patches of her hair had fallen out.</p><p>The doorway wavered, cried with a pain of its own, then vanished.</p><p>He froze time again, but she pulled herself out once again, faster this time, before he even reached her. Desperation flooded him, and still he approached. She hissed at him, baring her teeth, sharper and longer than his, and backed away.</p> <p>When he reached her, his steps quicker than hers, she snapped at him, trying to bite. He jerked backward, avoiding contact\u2014but just barely.</p><p>\u201cMistake, vampire. Big mistake. You\u2019ll ... pay ... for ... that,\u201d she gasped out, and a second later, she disappeared.</p><p>The scent of rot didn\u2019t fade, though. Which meant her men were still here. Why hadn\u2019t they helped her\u2014</p><p>They appeared out of nowhere, just as she had done, and they were scowling at him. Only three in total, but each held a pyre-gun.</p><p>He stopped time, intending to choke the ones in front of him as he\u2019d tried to do to the queen, then race to Ava, wherever she was. He couldn\u2019t believe this was happening, that he\u2019d failed, but just before he reached the guards, just as they too jerked themselves out of his time-hold, blue stun beams erupted, dozens of them. Not at him, but at the guards.</p> <p>His attention whipped to the side, and he saw that Ava was kneeling, aiming her own pyre-gun. That\u2019s my girl. Pride filled him. Noelle and the trainees were there, too, aiming guns of their own.</p><p>The civilians on the sidewalks cried out, scampering out of the way, and soon the area was deserted.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Ava called.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Let\u2019s get you out of here, though. I\u2019m not sure how long stun will last, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>A new group of warriors appeared behind Ava and the others. Before McKell could stop time\u2014before he could do anything\u2014fists were pummeling at his woman. And then, as he raced forward, his ability not helping in any way, a sharp pain tore through his back, and he fell face-first into the pavement.</p><p>Twenty-eight</p> <p>Taken unaware, Ava thought as stars obscured her vision. Someone had punched her in the head from behind. She\u2019d been feeling all smug and superior, getting the group of trainees to Noelle\u2019s van, then making them haul ass back to her apartment building without thinking ahead or announcing her plans.</p><p>She\u2019d wanted to pat herself on the back when she\u2019d stunned the men about to attack McKell. She\u2019d wanted to preen when McKell had looked over and realized she had helped, his expression hot and sweet and proud.</p><p>Then she\u2019d felt breath on the back of her neck, had seen horror fill McKell\u2019s violet eyes. A hard, meaty club had slammed into her temple, knocking her sideways. But when she turned, no one was behind her.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s kill \u2018em!\u201d Noelle shouted.</p><p>\u201cWithout drawing blood!\u201d Ava added, pulling herself to her knees. An odd statement, coming from her. Usually when she fought someone, she wanted blood to pour. \u201cNow let\u2019s get these bastards!\u201d</p><p>As if her cry was the starting bell, the trainees burst into action. Fists battered, legs kicked. A few were cut by the otherworlders, several were knocked down, and one was even tossed into the street and run over by a car, its sensors not, well, sensing him in time.</p><p>Where was McKell? She couldn\u2019t see him. He can take care of himself.</p><p>The aliens moved quickly, strongly, assuredly, doing their damage before spinning and inflicting more. Too bad for them, she\u2019d fought men who were quicker, stronger, and far more assured. She ducked when she needed to duck, punched in the throat, chest, stomach, and groin when given the opportunity, and jumped out of the way when all else failed.</p> <p>They could have bitten her, that would have infected her, but they didn\u2019t. Didn\u2019t even try. And it was strange. The fight would have been over then. Instead, they punched and kicked her. The others weren\u2019t so lucky. They were knifed.</p><p>Jeremy\u2019s arms looked like tattered ribbons, and the rest of the gang like discarded rags. Noelle faired better than any of them, even the aliens. She\u2019d confiscated three blades already, and slammed the hilts into their owners\u2019 temples. All three fell to the pavement, unconscious. Ava thought she spied blood on one\u2014a cracked lip. There wasn\u2019t time to check it out. Or worry.</p><p>The moment they hit, they disappeared. They weren\u2019t just invisible, they were gone. Ava tried to kick one as he fell, not realizing what would happen, and encountered only air, falling flat on her ass. Oxygen abandoned her in one massive heave; stars winked over her eyes.</p><p>Through those stars, she could see a bulky black form flying her way, silver blade flashing in the sunlight. She barely had enough breath to shout, \u201cTag team!\u201d</p><p>Noelle understood instantly. With a whirl, her friend was in front of her, absorbing the impact. She knew where Ava was, and managed to send the male away from her. He hit the pavement, hard, his skull cracking. Every muscle in his body relaxed, his head lolling to the side, and like the others, he disappeared. Only, he left a puddle of blood behind. No maybe about it.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d Ava shouted, scrambling back and dragging Noelle with her. \u201cSch\u00f6n blood!\u201d</p><p>Probably looking for a host ...</p><p>With the thought, her stomach cramped, and she moved in front of Noelle, as if she could block her friend from contamination. She would rather endure infection herself then risk Noelle. Or McKell. Hell, she\u2019d willingly accept the disease if it meant saving them.</p><p>A second later, a wave of dizziness hit her. Before she had time to panic, that wave dissipated.</p><p>The trainees caught on quick and scampered onto the street, willing to risk any oncoming traffic over the disease. Several Sch\u00f6n warriors were still standing, still geared up for\u2014and clearly wanting\u2014a fight.</p><p>They approached ... Stun rays hit them; they didn\u2019t stop.</p><p>Ava geared up, too, waiting. \u201cAnyone touch it?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>A chorus of \u201cno\u201ds rang out, but none of them sounded sure. No, they sounded scared.</p><p>Once again she glanced over to where McKell had been standing. This time, she saw him. Her eyes widened, her stomach clenching. He was down, an ax handle sticking out of his back, but he was pulling himself to his hands and knees, shaking his head to clear his mind, irises glazed but expression determined, furious. His exposed skin was bright red and blistered, steam rising from him and curling around him.</p><p>Fury of her own filled her, so much fury, as bright as the sun currently was. Worry and dread, too, but they couldn\u2019t compete with the fury. No one but Ava was allowed to hurt him. She forgot about the spilled blood, forgot about the consequences. Only thoughts of saving McKell had any bearing.</p><p>She launched forward\u2014or would have, if Noelle hadn\u2019t grabbed her by the shoulders, tossed her to the ground, and pinned her.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d her friend shouted. \u201cStay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey hurt McKell,\u201d she screeched, struggling for all she was worth.</p><p>Noelle held tight. \u201cHe\u2019ll live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that!\u201d Damn it, how was her friend so strong? \u201cHe needs my help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t let you risk it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d Ava managed to twist free and was on her feet a second later, stalking toward her prey.</p><p>Two steps in, she saw past the red haze surrounding her and realized that McKell, injured though he was, had things under control. He had snapped the necks of all but one warrior, who was flailing in his grip. Stilling. Dropping. Disappearing.</p><p>And just like that, the fight was over. The physical part, at least.</p><p>\u201cCall Mia,\u201d Ava threw over her shoulder. \u201cThis area needs to be quarantined.\u201d</p><p>Her heart pounded in her chest as she rushed toward McKell. His gaze burned her, and he met her halfway, his arms immediately wrapping around her. Those same arms had just murdered four men, but they were tender with her.</p><p>\u201cTell me you\u2019re okay,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay, but you, you were stabbed in the back.\u201d She held him as tight as she could, praying she never had to let go. Then she remembered his skin\u2014now she could actually hear the sizzle\u2014and tugged him into the shadows between two buildings.</p><p>She removed her shirt, uncaring who saw her bra, and tried to pull the material over his head, protecting him where the shadows couldn\u2019t reach. He flinched, grabbed her wrists, and stopped her.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelping you.\u201d She tried again.</p><p>Again he stopped her. \u201cYour shirt will cover your beautiful breasts or nothing at all.\u201d He practically wrestled the fabric out of her hands and jerked it back over her head. All the while, his gaze swept the agents behind them. He hissed at anyone who looked her way.</p><p>Ava thought she heard Noelle laugh as she hugged him, ready to restart that holding-on-forever thing. How close had she come to losing him?</p><p>\u201cUh, Ava, sweetheart? You\u2019re running your fingers through the very wound you mentioned,\u201d he gritted out.</p><p>That\u2019s right, and she didn\u2019t stop. \u201cWe almost died, and here I am, alive and affectionate. Yet you\u2019re standing there complaining about a little wound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! That hurts. And it\u2019s massive.\u201d</p><p>She grinned as she loosened her grip, rocked back on her heels, and stared up at him, reassured, happy, thankful. \u201cYou\u2019re such a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a vixen.\u201d His fingers tangled in her hair, angling her chin higher. \u201cYou\u2019ll never allow yourself to be taken unaware again. Vow it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI vow it. But you, too, Ax. You\u2019ve got to be more attentive to your surroundings.\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched with humor. \u201cI vow it.\u201d</p><p>They both knew they couldn\u2019t keep those vows, but Ava didn\u2019t care about that either. She felt better, knowing they would try to be more careful.</p><p>\u201cMia says she\u2019ll be here in five,\u201d Noelle called.</p><p>Ava tensed, reminded that the real danger hadn\u2019t passed yet. \u201cOne or all of us could be infected,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThere was blood on the ground. Infected blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he replied gravely. \u201cI don\u2019t fear for myself, but for you. And if you\u2019re infected, I\u2019m going to turn you.\u201d He latched onto her forearms and shook her. \u201cDo you understand?\u201d</p><p>Turned, she\u2019d have a chance with him. To make things work, despite her hang-ups and fears. And having almost lost him, she was suddenly on board with that plan. Before, she\u2019d hated the thought of never being able to go out in the sun again. But what did the daylight matter if she couldn\u2019t be with McKell?</p><p>\u201cI\u2014okay,\u201d she said. \u201cOkay. I don\u2019t like being forced to do it before I\u2019m ready, but okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God.\u201d He jerked her into his body, kissed her, tongue thrusting deep.</p><p>She took, she gave, she conquered. Ultimately, she submitted. They made love with their mouths, savoring, slow one moment, lightning fast and grasping at each other the next. It was a desperate kiss, one born of fear and determination. Of passion and more of that fear.</p><p>He might be selfish, possessive, and straight-up mean, but he left her reeling, falling, and reaching for an anchor. For him. He was her anchor. Had been since the day she\u2019d met him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t run when a fight got rough. He made the fight rougher. He didn\u2019t turn away when she threw attitude in his face. He got right up in her face. He didn\u2019t back down, he didn\u2019t cry, he didn\u2019t bend to her will.</p><p>Actually, he bent to no one\u2019s will.</p><p>A relationship with him would never be easy, but it would be fun. And yeah, if things ever fell apart, she would be destroyed. She doubted she could be with him and not give him everything. He wouldn\u2019t settle for anything but full measure. Men like him never did. Not that there was anyone like him. So decision made. She was in it for the long haul, no matter the reason he wanted her. Human, vampire, trash, royalty. Good enough, not good enough. She would give him everything\u2014and demand equal measure.</p><p>In the distance, she heard sirens.</p><p>Fear of infection hit her again, and she ended the kiss. She\u2019d told McKell someone \u201cmight be\u201d infected, but she knew the truth. Someone was infected. No question. When Sch\u00f6n blood left its host, it always found another. She and Noelle had been closest.</p><p>McKell licked his lips as though savoring her taste as he smoothed the hair from her brow. His hand was shaking. \u201cI won\u2019t allow them to separate us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she said with a nod. She had a feeling she would need him in the coming hours.</p><p>Tires squealed as vehicles parked. Finally, she looked away from McKell\u2014one of the hardest things she\u2019d ever done\u2014and faced the coming agents. They wore protective gear from the top of their heads to the soles of their feet, not an inch of skin visible. They knew it wouldn\u2019t help, but it probably made them feel better.</p><p>First thing they did was find the blood splattered over the concrete and spray some kind of chemical over it. They had to know the disease had already found a new host, that the blood was no longer contaminated.</p><p>How long until the newly infected sickened? She gulped.</p><p>The new agents hustled her, the once-again-sizzling McKell, Noelle, and the trainees into a metal van. Without a word. The door locked, sealing them inside. There was a bench on each side, hard, no cushions. Everyone, including McKell, sat. She\u2019d expected him to balk at such treatment, but he never did. And when she tried to sit between him and Noelle, he tugged her into his lap.</p><p>She snuggled close, her gaze finding and staying on her friend. The fear Ava felt was mirrored in Noelle\u2019s pretty gray eyes. Ava reached out. Noelle did the same. They twined fingers, squeezed. Their earlier fight was forgotten. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNow isn\u2019t the time to make out, girls,\u201d McKell said. Was that, dare she think it, amusement in his voice? \u201cWell, all right. If you insist. You can kiss, but make it quick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. McKell sharing something he considers his.\u201d Noelle smacked her lips in mock astonishment. \u201cWill wonders never cease?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019ve had something precious taken away from you,\u201d he said, \u201cyou learn to guard everything else. Especially that which means the most to you.\u201d His warm breath trekked over her temple. \u201cAre you comfortable, sweetheart?\u201d</p> <p>Something hot bloomed in Ava\u2019s chest. Sweetheart, again. \u201cOh, yes.\u201d</p><p>The vehicle jostled to a start, soon winding along the roads. The windows were darkened, so she couldn\u2019t see outside. Only the overhead light allowed her to see the men and women trapped with her.</p><p>Where they headed to AIR? To be locked up as Johnny was?</p><p>\u201cYour jaw\u2019s swollen,\u201d McKell said, brushing his knuckles gently over the wound in question.</p><p>Even so slight a touch sent a sharp pain shooting through her, and she flinched. She hadn\u2019t realized she\u2019d been punched there. \u201cNow that you mention it, it does hurt like a son of a bitch.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo,\u201d he said on a sigh, \u201cyou won\u2019t be able to do certain ... things for a while. That\u2019s almost a deal breaker.\u201d</p><p>Things like suck that beautiful cock? She laughed, then flinched again. \u201cJaw wounds take the longest time to heal.\u201d His teasing was distracting her, lightening her mood. Maybe hers would do the same for him.</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonths.\u201d</p><p>His shoulders sagged. \u201cI was playing at first. But months, you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d She burrowed her head in the hollow of his neck, hiding her grin. \u201cAnd God forbid if I have to have surgery. I mean, the bones feel out of joint. Healing could take years.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYears?\u201d he squeaked.</p><p>\u201cYou, Ava Sans, are evil,\u201d Noelle said with a laugh of her own.</p><p>Ava slapped her shoulder. \u201cStop listening to our conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen stop having a conversation for me to listen to. You know I can\u2019t help myself.\u201d</p><p>They didn\u2019t have to stop. The car did, and everyone in the van sobered instantly. Ava tensed. McKell crushed her to his chest as footsteps sounded. Then the doors opened, and Ava caught sight of multiple agents and an unfamiliar\u2014and very intimidating\u2014building. A warehouse, deserted, dark, nothing around it.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d one of the agents said, motioning them out.</p><p>Twenty-nine</p><p>They were given a room\u2014or, more aptly, a cell\u2014of their own. Maybe because McKell threatened to rip their escorts\u2019 throats out if they pushed him and Ava into the same room as all the others. They believed him. Which did, in fact, save their lives.</p> <p>His parting words to them? \u201cWatch us through the window, and I\u2019ll know. I\u2019ll feel your eyes, hear your heartbeats. And nothing will prevent me from reaching through it and, what? Slicing your goddamn throats.\u201d</p><p>The door closed with a click, enclosing him in a four-by-four with his darling Ava. They had a cot, padded walls, and a toilet, but he paid those things no heed. He stood in front of a door without any discernible seams, listening beyond. Footsteps pounded, voices murmured, and the rush of blood faded. Again the guards had heeded his advice and saved their own lives.</p><p>That done, McKell switched his full attention to Ava. She sat on the cot, elbows resting on her knees. Once again there was fear in her lovely eyes, and he didn\u2019t like it. Distraction, that\u2019s what she needed. Had worked before, in the van.</p><p>Touch, that\u2019s what he needed. He had to reaffirm that she lived.</p><p>When he\u2019d seen those warriors appear behind her, hit her, when he\u2019d tried to race to her, only to be stabbed in the back before he could get to her, he\u2019d experienced utter despair and instant rage. He couldn\u2019t abide the thought of her being hurt. He couldn\u2019t abide the thought of failing her.</p><p>She was everything to him.</p><p>And she would let him turn her. He\u2019d never thought he would have that option, but thankfully, fate had planned otherwise, and he knew his true gift, or vampire ability, was his blood. He was finally on the right path. Being together. Forever. Only thing he didn\u2019t like was the fact that she wasn\u2019t actually ready for the change. Deep down, he didn\u2019t want to turn her before she was ready.</p><p>The Sch\u00f6n queen had asked him if he loved her. He hadn\u2019t known then, but he knew now. He did. He loved her. He couldn\u2019t live without her, and it had nothing to do with needing her blood. He needed her. Ava. Her smile, her laugh, her scent, her hands, her breath, her stubbornness, her fury, her wit. Everything. Every part of her.</p><p>\u201cAva,\u201d he said, needing to tell her all of that. He didn\u2019t wait for her reply. He approached her and knelt in front of her, clasping her hands and feeling her heat, her pulse. Yes, touch\u2014connection\u2014was exactly what he\u2019d needed.</p><p>\u201cMcKell.\u201d His name was a plea, a benediction. She\u2019d wanted to be touched as much as he\u2019d wanted to touch her.</p><p>In an instant, holding hands wasn\u2019t enough. He gathered her in his arms, pivoted, and sat on the cot. He settled her in his lap while petting her hair, her nape, her arm. \u201cI have to tell you something,\u201d he began. There was no better time for a confession.</p><p>She was just a little stiff when she said, \u201cThat sounds serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. I ... love you.\u201d How would she react? He\u2019d never declared his feeling to another. Ever. \u201cI love you more than anything and anyone.\u201d</p><p>The stiffness drained from her. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d Part of him had expected a denial, he realized as a relieved breath fanned from him. \u201cYou delight me, Ava, in so many ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me those ways.\u201d</p><p>Anyone else would have laved him with kisses; Ava demanded proof. He smothered a laugh he knew she wouldn\u2019t understand. \u201cI\u2019m free to be myself with you. I have fun with you, even when circumstances are dire. You didn\u2019t have the easiest life, yet you never let that hinder you. You grew into a strong, stunning woman. My woman.\u201d He didn\u2019t want to pressure her into saying the words back to him. In this, he would not rush her. He stated his case and quickly changed the subject. \u201cNow. Tell me a secret about yourself. You promised to tell me \u2018later,\u2019 and now is later.\u201d</p><p>At first, she gave no response. Then she was sniffling and shaking, grinning and crying. Mostly crying.</p><p>\u201cWhat thoughts are dancing through your head, love?\u201d Of all the reactions he\u2019d thought she would give him, that wasn\u2019t even on the list.</p><p>She cried a little harder. Then, \u201cI\u2014I\u2014all right,\u201d she said, ignoring his question. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you a secret.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her temple. \u201cLet\u2019s hear it.\u201d He wanted to know everything about her, even at the expense of his need to soothe her. He wanted to pamper her for the rest of eternity.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d She wiped her eyes with the back of her wrist. \u201cI adore old kung fu movies. That\u2019s where I picked up my mad ass-beating skills.\u201d</p><p>Again, he tried not to laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s a wee bit surprising. I\u2019ve seen a few of them, and know kung fu is all about fighting with\u2014and don\u2019t take this the wrong way, love. Fighting with honor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying I\u2019m not honorable?\u201d She straightened and glared at him.</p><p>\u201cAva, love. You tasered me. Stabbed me. Stunned me twice. You lack honor, and I\u2019m glad. Honor won\u2019t win a battle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d With a sigh, she relaxed back against him. \u201cNow tell me a secret about you.\u201d</p><p>He thought about what to tell her, and before he knew it, five minutes had passed in silence. She waited patiently. \u201cI don\u2019t think children are too terrible of monsters,\u201d he finally said. An easy fact based in truth; one she might like.</p><p>She knew him well enough to understand what he was saying. \u201cYou want a family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne day, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith ... me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly with you.\u201d And when she turned vampire, children would most likely be possible. If not, well, he wouldn\u2019t be too disappointed because he would have Ava all to himself.</p><p>She pressed a soft kiss into his nape, lingered ... licked. \u201cI don\u2019t think kids are too terrible of monsters, either.\u201d</p><p>His blood heated, rushing through his veins to meet her lips. Though he wanted to toss her down on the cot, strip her, have her, he didn\u2019t move. The conversation was too important.</p><p>\u201cMcKell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He hadn\u2019t meant to growl. That heat ...</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I love you.\u201d</p><p>Thank God. He hadn\u2019t wanted to rush her, but damn! He\u2019d needed to hear those three words so badly. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to say it back if you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you. I\u2019ve never said that to anyone before, but I do. I love you. You\u2019re stubborn, possessive, and passionate. You make me laugh, and ache, and dream. And sometimes, like now, you make me feel so special. I like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are special and I want to make you feel that way always.\u201d His arms tightened around her, probably breaking her sweet little bones. But he had two choices, and he knew it. Either hold her like this, or throw her down as he still craved. \u201cWhen did you realize your feelings for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you were bleeding to death.\u201d</p><p>He barked out a laugh, unable to stop himself this time. \u201cThat\u2019s all it took, hmm? Almost dying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d Her fingers traced the scar on his chest, and he leaned into the gentle touch.</p><p>Can\u2019t throw her down, can\u2019t throw her down. \u201cHad I known, I would\u2019ve allowed someone to stab me much sooner. But you do realize now that I was never close to death, yes? I\u2019m too strong to die.\u201d And he had too much to live for.</p><p>The wicked tip of her tongue emerged, giving his pulse another caress. \u201cSpeaking of dying, what are we going to do about our little problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLittle problem. So you don\u2019t mean the big problem you\u2019re creating in his pants?\u201d</p><p>For the first time since he\u2019d met her, she giggled. He adored the sound.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking about the queen?\u201d he asked. \u201cOur imprisonment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I think ... I think we\u2019re gonna have to escape this compound. No one knows how to defeat her, and you\u2019re the best chance AIR has of winning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe defeated me before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but now you know what to expect.\u201d</p><p>True. He didn\u2019t mention how easily the queen adapted to everything, even his tricks.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re going to do it? Escape? Fight her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I want you safe, love. By fair means or foul, I\u2019ll see it done.\u201d And he would. Whatever he had to do.</p><p>Ava\u2019s teeth came out to play, nibbling where she\u2019d licked. \u201cWell, then, you\u2019ll need to be properly nourished.\u201d</p><p>In seconds, his need racketed close to I-can\u2019t-control-myself territory. Biting her, drinking her, holding her, hands roving ... He might not be strong enough to turn her down. \u201cWhat are you saying, love?\u201d Maybe he had misunderstood.</p><p>\u201cThat I want you to bite me,\u201d she said, confirming his thoughts. \u201cYou need the blood, and I need to feed you. Want to feed you.\u201d She traced a heart on his chest. \u201cLet me do this.\u201d</p><p>He captured her hand and kissed the fluttering pulse at her wrist. He was shaking, mouth watering with the force of his desires. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d No, he wasn\u2019t strong enough.</p><p>She lifted her head and peered at him, a tigress determined to get her way. \u201cI\u2019m sure. So let me do this for you, McKell. Victor. My Victor. For me. I tortured you for days, not giving you more than a few sips. Let me give you everything.\u201d</p><p>Like that, he did reach the point where he lost control. More than his mouth filling with moisture, his tongue was swelling. His teeth were aching. His heart was threatening to explode. \u201cYou\u2019re sure you\u2019re not too weakened from the fight?\u201d he asked again, because he would rather die than hurt her further.</p><p>Slowly she grinned. \u201cBelieve me, I wouldn\u2019t lie about something like that.\u201d</p><p>He tumbled her to the cot so that he loomed above her, and she immediately turned her head, offering an unobstructed view of her neck. Her lovely neck. Her pulse fluttered there, too, and he could hear the rush of her decadent blood.</p><p>Mine.</p><p>First he licked her, softening her skin. She moaned. Then he sucked, drawing the blood up and causing it to pool, readying for him. She groaned. Then, sweet heaven, then he bit. Sucked. Swallowed.</p><p>And reared back in horror.</p><p>The hot flow of her blood trickled from his mouth, but he didn\u2019t lick it up. He wiped it away with his hand, trying not to cringe or shout.</p><p>\u201cAva,\u201d he said shakily.</p><p>Frowning, she sat up. Suddenly there were dark circles under her eyes. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>No, he thought, nearing hysteria in a heartbeat of time. No, no, no. He knew he could turn her, had planned for it. Would. But he was suddenly so damn afraid. What if that didn\u2019t work? What if she died anyway? What if he killed her?</p><p>\u201cMcKell! What is it? What\u2019s wrong? You\u2019re scaring me.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed the lump forming in his throat. \u201cYou\u2019re ... you\u2019re the one infected, love. You have the Sch\u00f6n disease.\u201d</p><p>At first, Ava denied McKell\u2019s claim. As the hours ticked away, her warrior pacing in front of her, trying to decide what to do, how best to save her, she could feel herself weakening, denial no longer possible. She could even hear a voice inside her head. A female voice. Not her own, either. This voice grew stronger with every minute that passed, and the stronger it became, the more it seemed to take over. As if Ava\u2019s will was no longer her own. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTurn me,\u201d she said to McKell\u2014as she had the thousand other times since he\u2019d said those damning words. You\u2019re the one infected.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know what happened to Johnny,\u201d he replied. Again. And just like before, he banged on the glass panel in their cell. \u201cTell us about Johnny, damn it!\u201d But he\u2019d warned the agents away, so no one responded.</p><p>She\u2019d never seen McKell so panicked. And that he was for her, well, if she\u2019d still harbored any doubts about his feelings for her, she no longer did. He wanted to change her, not because he viewed vampires as superior, but because he loved her and feared losing her.</p> <p>A sudden pain tore through her chest, and she groaned.</p><p>McKell rushed back to her side, cupping her jaw and forcing her to look up at him. Black dots were winking in front of her, weaving together, forming a solid wall.</p><p>\u201cAva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurn me. You\u2019re the one who insisted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But ... I\u2019m so afraid. I would rather you infect a thousand others and live than risk poisoning you with my blood.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou won\u2019t kill\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that. Not for sure. We have no idea how Johnny responded after the initial exposure, and I think we both remember the way he screamed.\u201d</p><p>Yeah. Johnny\u2019s pain-filled scream still haunted her. \u201cI love you, and I\u2019m willing to risk anything to be with you,\u201d she said, and she meant it. Maybe it had taken nearly losing him to realize the truth, but she did. She loved him.</p><p>\u201cNo. Besides everything else, you\u2019re not ready. You said so yourself before we got here.\u201d His grip tightened on her. \u201cThere has to be another way to save you. There just has to.\u201d</p><p>A terrible thought hit her. What if she\u2019d exposed him to the disease? They\u2019d kissed, and he\u2019d drunk from her. \u201cOh, God, McKell. What if you\u2019re sick?\u201d</p><p>His hard expression didn\u2019t change. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching for a symptom. Nothing so far.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019d lied to him, she realized. She wouldn\u2019t risk \u201canything.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t risk him. She would rather die. And she just might. Because there was no way in hell she would sleep with anyone else. Even to save herself.</p><p>Tears burned her eyes, eyes that now felt like they\u2019d been rubbed raw with sandpaper. Another symptom for her? What did it matter? she thought next, nearing hysteria. Finally she\u2019d committed to someone, and she was going to lose him.</p><p>\u201cAva, damn it!\u201d McKell punched the cot, right beside her temple, and she bounced up at the force he used. \u201cI love you more than I love myself. Do you hear me? I wasn\u2019t exaggerating earlier. I love you so damn much, I hurt. There has to be a way to fix this. To save you and keep you human.\u201d</p><p>Another pain tore through her, and she squeezed her lids shut. That didn\u2019t help, even a little. Only managed to hurt her more. To hold her cries inside, she bit her lip until she tasted blood. Rotten blood. She gagged, and McKell patted her back, leaning closer to her. Gradually she became aware of a gnawing, gut-wrenching hunger ... of McKell\u2019s divine scent ...</p><p>A taste, one taste, she thought. Of his skin, his blood, his organs. That would ease the pain. Surely.</p><p>\u201cAva?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened when she realized the direction of her thoughts. Oh, God. She wanted to eat him.</p><p>Gasping in horror, she flattened her palms on his chest and pushed him. \u201cGo! Please! Go!\u201d The tears rained in streaks of acid, scalding her checks. \u201cYou have to go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo to the queen. Kill her. Because if you stay here, I\u2019ll try and kill you. And I would hate myself, McKell. Please.\u201d The last left her on a choking sob.</p><p>If he replied, she would never know. The voice ... consuming her, becoming all that she knew.</p><p>You stupid bitch! You weren\u2019t supposed to become infected. Now I can\u2019t use your body.</p><p>Ava found herself wanting to apologize. She loved that voice. It was the calm in the storm, her anchor. She frowned. No, McKell was her anchor. She hated that voice and she\u2014was edging toward McKell, teeth sharpening, she realized. Gasping again, she reared back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll fix this, sweetheart,\u201d McKell said flatly. \u201cI\u2019ll fix this, I swear. I have no life without you.\u201d</p><p>Thirty</p><p>McKell kept an eye on Ave as he paced through their cell. She hadn\u2019t leapt at him and attacked, but she was poised to do so at any moment. He could have busted out and probably should have. He\u2019d drunk from her, he was strong enough, wasn\u2019t sickening, but he couldn\u2019t force himself to leave her.</p><p>Soon she would die.</p><p>No! Ava loved him. She\u2019d offered everything he\u2019d ever wanted. The love, of course, plus acceptance, challenge, and understanding. And then, a heartbeat later, that had all been taken away. She truly was dying, slowly wasting away. Soon she would kill. There was hunger in her eyes. Hunger for human flesh. He would give all that he was, even that, to save her.</p><p>Sexual intercourse and the exchange of blood, and possibly saliva, were the only ways to pass the disease. He could now be infected himself, as she\u2019d guessed, but he honestly didn\u2019t think he was. Hours had passed, a wretched infinity, but he was fine. Still strong. Like Bride\u2019s, his blood must hold the cure. Except, the disease always adapted quickly. Because he\u2019d been exposed, because he was well, he could drain himself into Ava and still not save her.</p><p>He could actually do more harm than good. Johnny\u2019s scream ...</p><p>There was only one thing left for McKell to do. He had to reverse time, and he had to do it now. Whatever was necessary, he had to stop Ava from becoming infected. That was the only way.</p><p>If he did manage to reverse time, though, she would no longer love him. She wouldn\u2019t see him stabbed, wouldn\u2019t realize her heart belonged to him, and might try to kick him out of her life. If he didn\u2019t, she would die. So really, there was no contest. He simply had to reverse time.</p><p>Stopping time was easy. He simply thought, Halt, and it obeyed. Stopping the people around him, so that they didn\u2019t realize time was passing, was easy, too. He simply thought, Freeze, and they obeyed. Making time whizz by faster, he could do that, too. But for the last hour, he\u2019d been thinking, Reverse and Rewind and Backward, yet nothing had happened. He was running out of words to say, things to try.</p><p>You can do this. \u201cTime bends to my will,\u201d he gritted out. As Ava would say, \u201cTime is my bitch.\u201d Nothing. No reaction.</p><p>Ava watched him, licked her lips.</p><p>Concentrate. He had to try something else. He thought back to when he was a young child. Way, way back. He\u2019d had no control of his gift, freezing time and people when he\u2019d had no desire to do so, unable to freeze them when he did want to, but his parents hadn\u2019t seemed concerned.</p><p>Let your worries fade, his mother had said in her gentle voice. She\u2019d had long black hair and vivid violet eyes, her face so perfect it could have been sculpted by an angel. They merely block your passion for this task.</p><p>Besides his few conversations with Ava, McKell hadn\u2019t thought of his mother in so long, his chest ached. How he wished she could have met Ava. Granted, she would have been horrified at first, because there\u2019d been no one more timid than Carina, and no one more determined to ensure propriety was adhered to in the home, but with time, the two would have fallen in love.</p><p>He pictured his father, standing behind his mother, hands resting on the woman\u2019s delicate shoulders. Now there was a man who hadn\u2019t cared about propriety in any way. He\u2019d loved his woman, though, and had striven to make her happy, despite the whisper about her infidelity.</p><p>Who is stronger? his father had asked. The complete opposite of his wife, Dante had looked as rough-and-tumble as a man could. Scars all over his face and arms, lips always thinned as if stuck in a perpetual scowl. You or time?</p><p>Me, he\u2019d thought then. Me, he thought now. He squared his shoulders, closed his eyes. He blanked his mind. I\u2019m in control. Time bends to my will.</p><p>Over and over he repeated the claim. About the hundredth time, he stared to believe. Yes, he could do this. He was strong. Stronger. He managed to release his worry, his cares, and pictured the threads of time as he\u2019d had to do as a child. Those threads were woven together, a road leading forward, backward, side to side. Millions of tiny little lights traveled that road, all heading in the same direction. Only a few veered off course and moved along the curving side paths.</p><p>\u201cMcKell,\u201d Ava said.</p><p>For her own good, he ignored her. I\u2019m in control. Time bends to my will. As a child, he\u2019d needed to touch the threads. To trail his fingertips in the direction he wanted to go. He reached out.</p><p>\u201cMcKell!\u201d Such a hungry, hungry growl. She would jump him. Any moment now, and she would jump him.</p><p>McKell latched on to the threads, experienced a jolt of electricity, almost dropped them but managed to stop time as a warm current of breath wafted over his neck. Shit. He hadn\u2019t heard Ava move, but she had closed the distance between them. Had almost bitten into him.</p><p>Concentrate. All the lights stopped winking, just sort of waiting for his next move. I can do this. He tugged, as hard as he could, his shoulders nearly pulling from their sockets. Nothing. The threads remained in place. Just like the other times he\u2019d tried this. He didn\u2019t give up, didn\u2019t lose confidence.</p><p>He tugged again and again, his palms stinging, his entire body still vibrating with the electricity. When he stilled, he barely had any energy left. Damn it! There had to be a way to move these threads.</p><p>Okay. So. He took stock. Tugging obviously wouldn\u2019t work, but he couldn\u2019t let go because time would kick back up the moment he did, and Ava would start munching on him.</p><p>Ava. His precious Ava. He would return her to the way she\u2019d been, so pink and fresh and vital ... An image of her consumed his mind\u2014and as easily as if he\u2019d been pulling a feather on a string, the lights moved backward.</p><p>At first, he could only stand there, disbelieving and incoherent. How had ... what had ... But even those thoughts tapered off when he realized he was peering over at himself. He and Ava were still inside the cell, but she was on his lap, and they were talking and hugging.</p><p>Had he done it? Had he truly reversed time?</p><p>Emboldened, he tugged the threads again. They remained in place. What the hell? He nearly shouted in frustration. What had changed? What had he done differently? He thought back. He\u2019d decided tugging didn\u2019t work, and had then visualized Ava.</p><p>He pictured her again. Cheeks pink, skin fresh, body vital. The threads glided backward another inch, and he watched himself lift Ava off his lap and place her on the cot. Watched himself stride away from her\u2014backward.</p><p>Relief and joy both flooded him, consuming him, overshadowing the painful jolts still working through him. Yes. Yes! He truly had done it.</p><p>He knew now he couldn\u2019t manipulate time with force. Not when going in reverse. He had to manipulate time with pictures. Pictures of ... who he wanted to see, when he wanted to see them?</p><p>He pictured Ava as she\u2019d been in the van, and once more the threads glided back until he was viewing exactly what he\u2019d imagined. He began sweating, shaking, the threads fighting for release, burning his palms. Come on. Just a little further. He pictured Ava on the street, walking beside him, at the same time tugging those threads so forcefully his bones rattled.</p><p>Seconds later, he saw himself, Ava, and the street. At that point in their lives, they hadn\u2019t yet come into contact with the Sch\u00f6n queen and her men. Here, Ava was healthy, whole. This was it, then, the time frame he needed.</p><p>He almost let go. Almost. What would happen next? Would the man he was now disappear, along with his memories? No, he thought with determination. No. That couldn\u2019t\u2014wouldn\u2019t\u2014happen. He always remembered when he manipulated time in the other direction. Why not this way, too?</p><p>Only way one to find out ...</p><p>Remember, remember, please remember. Deep breath in, hold ... hold, release. He opened his fingers as the breath expelled from him. The threads jumped as far away from him as they could, bouncing together as they realigned.</p><p>The electricity abandoned him in a rush, leaving McKell burning, scalding, blistering like he did when he ventured into the daylight, and just when he was about to roar from the pain, he blinked, the pain faded, and he realized he was standing alongside Ava, not just watching but actually walking down that sidewalk with her.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Ava suddenly said, and he knew\u2014knew\u2014what was about to happen.</p><p>He had remembered.</p><p>He wanted to whoop as she stopped and withdrew her cell phone. Wanted to hug her as she frowned. Somehow he managed to stay where he was,</p><p>\u201cJust got a text from Dallas. The Sch\u00f6n queen plans to target a couple. She\u2019ll threaten one so the other will do whatever she wants. He says she can read minds, so we aren\u2019t to think about what we would do to her if that happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d McKell said, heart slamming against his ribs. This was it. He couldn\u2019t mess this up. Had to keep Ava safe.</p><p>Her frown deepened. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d Clearly, she didn\u2019t remember.</p><p>Still. The question pleased him. Already he was changing the future. \u201cJust do. Come on.\u201d</p><p>She pocketed her phone, and he pulled her into motion. Faster, faster, his determination to save her so intense his shaking renewed. He led her away from her apartment building and to a nice coffee shop. Inside, he forced her into a chair and motioned distractedly for Noelle and the trainees, who had followed them, to find their own.</p><p>\u201cBuy her the biggest butterscotch latte they have,\u201d he commanded Noelle. \u201cAnd do not let her leave. Do you understand? Her life is at stake.\u201d</p><p>Confusion fell like a curtain over Noelle\u2019s features. \u201cO-kay. How, may I ask, is her life at stake if she doesn\u2019t get a latte?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He ignored her, his gaze locking on Ava. Such pretty pink skin, such healthy blood flowing underneath. That wasn\u2019t going to change. Not this time. \u201cStay here,\u201d he said, willing to beg. \u201cThere\u2019s an army of Sch\u00f6n warriors stationed around your apartment. If you go there, they\u2019ll kill you. Do you understand? I\u2019ve seen it. And for God\u2019s sake, whatever happens, remember that I love you.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw dropped. \u201cYou\u2014what?\u201d</p><p>In this new reality, he hadn\u2019t yet told her that, had he? \u201cI love you. I love you for who you are, what you are, though we\u2019ll discuss turning you into a vampire at a later date. Perhaps after I allow someone to almost kill me. But until then, stay safe, damn it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlmost kill you?\u201d All the color abandoned her face. \u201cStay safe? McKell, what are you talking\u2014\u201d</p><p>He kissed her, hard, silencing her. He allowed himself to enjoy, because he couldn\u2019t help himself. He\u2019d come so close to losing her, was so relieved by this second chance. When he raised his head, her eyes were glazed, her lips red and swollen.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he repeated, then turned away. A bell chimed as he left the shop.</p><p>Part of him expected Ava to follow, but he didn\u2019t pick up her scent as he headed toward her apartment. Last time, he\u2019d tried to freeze the queen and had failed. He\u2019d tried to choke her and had failed. There was only one other thing he could think to do. And it meant ...</p><p>Shit! It most likely meant losing Ava, he realized, bile churning in his stomach. Even after reversing time, he still might not be able to keep her. He almost backtracked, almost returned to her, gathered her up, and ran away with her.</p> <p>But he had to do this. He couldn\u2019t allow that bitch of a queen to walk freely, so powerful, so assured, threatening his woman and those she loved. He would rather die keeping Ava safe than live while she remained in danger.</p><p>The bile mixed with another round of determination. His plan might still fail, but he would have tried. He would have done all that he could to protect his woman. That\u2019s what mattered.</p><p>Enough pondering, worrying, obsessing, he thought. Wouldn\u2019t do to warn the queen of the fate that now awaited her.</p><p>The moment he spied Ava\u2019s building, he slowed his steps, waiting ... waiting ... A doorway opened, just as before, glittering so prettily in the moonlight. McKell gulped back the lump forming in his throat, stopped time before he could change his mind, and sprinted forward. The queen hadn\u2019t been able to fight him right away last time, which meant she wouldn\u2019t be able to do so this time either.</p><p>He only had a minute, maybe two, to do his damage.</p><p>She was there, he knew she was, for he could once again smell her rot. Rage overtook him as he remembered where she\u2019d stood. You\u2019re going to pay, female. He beelined for her, stretching out his arms.</p> <p>Behind him, he heard Ava shout his name. \u201cMcKell! What are you doing? McKell!\u201d</p><p>Damn her! Of course she hadn\u2019t remained behind. He\u2019d been a fool to think she would. That wasn\u2019t in her nature, was one of the many reasons he loved her.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t allow her near the queen or the queen\u2019s men, so he increased his speed. Boom! He slammed into the bodies, four that he could tell, continuing to surge forward. He heard a feminine gasp, several male grunts, and drove them all straight into the waiting doorway.</p><p>Ava screamed, \u201cNooo! No! McKell! Where are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>As before, the suction began the moment he approached, pulling him faster and faster. Soon he lost the foundation under his feet. His world began to spin, the air darkening, thickening. The queen and her men shrieked, a horrified choir, and he lost his grip on them, too. Down, down he fell, still spinning, faster and faster.</p><p>Was this the eternity that awaited them all? To spin and spin and spin? Fine. He could accept that. For Ava, he\u2019d suffer anything.</p><p>\u201cMcKell. Finally.\u201d A man\u2019s contented purr drifted into his ears.</p><p>McKell\u2019s momentum slowed, the spinning ceased, and he was eased to his feet by gentle hands he couldn\u2019t see. His surroundings blinked into focus. A black sky was dotted by the very flickers of light he\u2019d seen on the threads of time, an endless maze of midnight, both perfect and horrific because there was no beginning or end.</p> <p>\u201cWelcome home, my son.\u201d</p><p>Home? Son? He shook his head in denial, anger rising. \u201cWho are you? Where are you?\u201d Come out and fight me, you bastard. \u201cWhere are the ones I brought with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you about them. In time.\u201d A second later, a man stepped from the darkness. He was tall, taller than McKell, with ankle-length black hair and eyes that glowed bright green. He looked human, for the most part, with a long forehead, a slashing nose, and a wide chin. His limbs stretched more than normal, and his body was a little thinner than average. He wore some kind of bodysuit that molded to his pale, pale skin.</p><p>McKell didn\u2019t rush him. Not yet. Information first. Killing second. \u201cAre you the one who\u2019s been calling me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Like the purr, the deep voice whispered straight into his head\u2014but the man\u2019s lips never moved.</p><p>What kind of powers did this being wield? \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re ready to hear the answer.\u201d Still no movement from those lips.</p><p>\u201cTell me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me time, and I will\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me, damn it!\u201d</p><p>The pause that followed his second demand extended uncomfortably. He thought he would be thrown back into that endless spin. Instead, the man sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re not ready for the truth, but I can see now that you will not calm down until you have answers. I wish I could fault you for your impatience, yet you are your father\u2019s son. And I\u2014I am that father. Your father.\u201d</p><p>Even after the \u201cmy son\u201d comment, the announcement still managed to shock him. \u201cNo,\u201d he automatically insisted. \u201cNo. My father is dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assure you. He is very much alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother once came to me as you have done. Did you know that? Did she tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard rumors,\u201d he gritted out, hating to admit even that. To do so lent credit to the man\u2019s claim. \u201cAnd sometimes I heard her crying at night when she thought no one listened.\u201d</p><p>The man, being, whatever, seemed to wilt at that. \u201cShe missed me as much as I missed her. I didn\u2019t want that for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His hands fisted, the anger suddenly a living force inside him. He could handle anything but a false declaration of concern for his mother\u2019s well-being. At last he attempted to close the distance between them, to lash out, but he found that his feet were somehow rooted in place. \u201cWhat have you done to me?\u201d</p><p>His denial and question were ignored. \u201cI saw her, wanted her, and talked to her as I talked to you. She, too, eventually joined me and we spent many months together. She grew to love me as I loved her, but always the husband stood in our way. She needed his blood, and mine would not sustain her.\u201d</p><p>As the man spoke\u2014still straight into his mind\u2014images colored the midnight canvas around them. Images of McKell\u2019s mother, here, dancing, dark hair flying. He heard her, too; her laughter stroked his ears, flinging him back to his childhood, to days in the caves, his bruises tended by loving hands, violet eyes watching him with concern.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I am not your son,\u201d he croaked. \u201cI can\u2019t be.\u201d He knew his father. Loved his father. Had mourned his father.</p><p>\u201cBefore you deny my claims, hear the rest. Please.\u201d</p><p>A moment passed. He nodded stiffly. What else could he do? He was still rooted in place, helpless. Still needed to know what had happened to the queen and her men. Antagonizing wouldn\u2019t help.</p><p>\u201cShe convinced me to let her go, to let the child I had given her go. She couldn\u2019t survive with him, nor could she tolerate the thought of leaving you behind. She said she would have no life without you, only one of despair and loneliness. And so I finally agreed, even though I feared you would be different from your kind. Set apart, perhaps loathed. Still. I swore I would not return to the caves, and I never did. I thought you would be lost to me forever, but you came to the surface. And now you have come to me.\u201d</p><p>Again, images formed around them. His mother tearfully clutching the man\u2019s cheeks as she begged him to understand. The man crying, too, hugging her fiercely, his heart already breaking.</p><p>\u201cI sensed your trepidation, each time I approached you, but I also promised your mother I would not force you to come here, that I would not tell you who I was unless you did, that I would not interfere. So thank you. Thank you for offering me this opportunity to at last meet my son.\u201d He truly did sound grateful.</p><p>McKell fought for breath. He wanted to continue denying what the man was telling him, but tendrils of doubt were working through him. He could manipulate time, yet no other vampire could. Not even the nefreti. His mother had been barren with his father, yet months along in a pregnancy between one day and the next.</p><p>This was surreal, a total upheaval in everything he\u2019d ever believed.</p><p>\u201cHow can you be my ...\u201d His jaw ached, he clenched the bones so tightly. He couldn\u2019t yet say the word father. Not in conjunction with this stranger. \u201cVampires can\u2019t procreate with anyone but their spouse.\u201d</p><p>Those green eyes softened. \u201cI am ... different. As are all my people. We live in this plane, able to open doorways into any world, any time. And so, during our months together, I returned your mother to her unmated days, though still my blood was not what she needed. And when we parted, I returned her as close to the day I took her as possible, without affecting her memory.\u201d</p><p>Unbelievable. Impossible. And yet ... true. Suddenly he knew the truth deep in his soul. There was no reason to lie to him, nothing the man could gain. And he could actually scent the affection and joy wafting around him. Scents he\u2019d learned because of Ava.</p><p>And really, everything made sense now. Who he was, what he was, what he could do, what he couldn\u2019t. His mother\u2019s sadness. She had loved this man, probably would have died here, unwilling to drink from anyone else, but had left him. Had lived. For McKell.</p><p>His anger drained, the fight leaving him. \u201cWhat do you want with me?\u201d he asked, realizing his feet had been freed. He could move unrestrained now. He did, approaching the man. He reached out, shaking, and touched that pale white skin. It was smooth, cool. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>Lips nearly as pale as his skin quirked at the corners. \u201cI am called Viktor.\u201d</p><p>So they shared a name. That, more than anything, proved his mother\u2019s love for this man. \u201cWhat do you want with me?\u201d he asked again, adding, \u201cViktor.\u201d</p><p>The glow in those green eyes brightened. \u201cTime. I want time, a chance to learn about each other. I can show you all the worlds in existence. I can show you people and riches you could not even imagine. I can take you to the sunless vampire world when it bloomed like a night flower, the petals rich and silky.\u201d</p><p>Time, yes. A little, he could give. A chance to know each other, he suddenly wanted that, too. \u201cI have a woman.\u201d His eyes widened as he realized he might be able to return to her. That he might not be stuck here. His ... father had returned his mother to her world. He could do the same for McKell.</p><p>Some of the glow dimmed. \u201cI have seen her, this Ava Sans. She is very lovely, but she is not bonded to you as your mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want her to be.\u201d His arm fell to his side. \u201cI want to be with her. Always. I have to be with her. Not only for blood, but for ... life. I\u2019m nothing without her.\u201d</p><p>Viktor\u2019s head tilted to the side, and sadness claimed his long features. \u201cShe followed you from the caf\u00e9. She saw you disappear and broke down. The warriors who remained on the street appeared and attacked, because they, too, saw you take their queen. Ava was infected. She will die, and you will no longer need her blood.\u201d</p><p>No. No! His knees almost buckled as panic infused his every cell. He hadn\u2019t risked everything, his life, his happiness, his future, for his woman to die out there, alone, afraid. \u201cTake me back to her. Now. If you won\u2019t, I\u2019ll reverse time again and I won\u2019t come here.\u201d A threat he would see through.</p><p>When his father next replied, McKell understood exactly where he\u2019d gotten his ruthless streak. \u201cGive me what I ask for. Time, a chance, and I will return the Sch\u00f6n to their world before they have a chance to infect your Ava. That will not keep them away from Earth forever, but as barren as their planet is, they will be too weak to return quickly.\u201d</p><p>Ava would be safe, then. Ava would be healthy. Would live. \u201cBefore I agree, tell me something. What did you do with the ones I brought with me?\u201d He could still hear them screaming.</p><p>\u201cThey are between portals at the moment, but again, I can\u2019t hold them like that forever. I need to send them somewhere. Agree, and I\u2019ll send them to their home planet with the others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAva\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t keep you from her forever, McKell. Just give me time. Please. Agree, and you will see her again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon\u201d wasn\u2019t soon enough, he wanted her now. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019ll learn nothing about each other. A year.\u201d</p><p>Everything inside him rebelled. \u201cA month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix months, and that\u2019s as little as I\u2019ll accept.\u201d That purring voice had firmed.</p><p>\u201cShe will be healthy? Remain healthy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>McKell knew Viktor wouldn\u2019t budge on this. Their determination was obviously equaled. \u201cI ... agree.\u201d Damn, damn, damn! Six months without Ava. He wasn\u2019t sure he would survive. Physically, yes, he probably could. He could sip from others. Still. He\u2019d be weak and emaciated when he finally reached her and he would have to be careful not to accidentally drain her at his first true feeding, but he wasn\u2019t going to allow her to be purged from his system. Ever. \u201cGo one day over the allotted six months, and I\u2019ll tear this world apart\u2014and you with it. I don\u2019t care who you are.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>Thirty-one</p><p>Three days after McKell had told her how much he loved her, that he wanted her safe, Ava realized he\u2019d abandoned her. She\u2019d expected the abandonment from the first, but had maybe kinda sorta convinced herself it wouldn\u2019t happen.</p> <p>What made it worse was that she knew he hadn\u2019t wanted to leave her. There hadn\u2019t been a good-bye in his last kiss. Merely relief and joy. He wouldn\u2019t have felt those things if he\u2019d been planning on leaving her. Because he loved her. He fucking loved her. But he was missing, and there wasn\u2019t a goddamn thing she could do about it.</p><p>She knew he would come back to her if he could. Which meant he couldn\u2019t come back.</p><p>Oh, God. A new round of sobbing started up.</p><p>The last few minutes together kept replaying in her mind. He\u2019d plopped her in that seat at the coffee shop and taken off as if his feet were on fire. She\u2019d sat there a moment, staring at Noelle, confused, overjoyed that her live-in had just admitted to deeper feelings, real feelings, when she\u2019d realized he had also told her that Sch\u00f6n warriors were at her apartment. In a snap, she\u2019d known he meant to battle them on his own.</p><p>Like she could allow that to happen.</p> <p>She\u2019d gathered her group and taken off after him. Only to watch him disappear. She hadn\u2019t known what had happened to him, where he\u2019d gone, how he\u2019d gone. But she\u2019d waited. For hours. A day, then two. Never moving from the sidewalk. On this third morning, she\u2019d been weak, shaky, crying, nearing hysteria because he could be hurt or worse, and Noelle had managed to overpower her and whisk her home.</p><p>Along the way, her friend had told her that Johnny and every other Sch\u00f6n-infected person locked in AIR headquarters had disappeared the same morning McKell had. Just boom, there one moment, gone the next.</p><p>Where? How? she wondered. Where they with McKell? Was he infected now?</p><p>And then, yesterday, Johnny had been returned to AIR. Again, just boom, pop, he was there when he hadn\u2019t been a moment before. He\u2019d been confused, yet healthy. And thirsty. So thirsty. Thanks to McKell\u2019s blood, he was a vampire now. And he wanted Ava.</p><p>He called all the time. Only once had she answered, and that had been to ask him where he\u2019d gone, how he\u2019d gotten back, if he\u2019d seen McKell. He hadn\u2019t known, so she didn\u2019t care to talk to him.</p><p>Another round of sobs started, and she rolled to her side. She lay on the bed she\u2019d shared with McKell for one glorious sexcapade, his scent all over the sheets. She might never leave.</p> <p>Noelle was in the process of packing McKell\u2019s things, trying to clear any memory of him from Ava\u2019s mind. A good plan. Except for the fact that he was burned into her memory no matter what was around her.</p><p>Ava squeezed her eyes shut, holding the rest of the tears in place.</p><p>The mattress eased down on one side. \u201cYou look terrible,\u201d Noelle said gently.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHellina\u2019s doing well. She\u2019s sleeping on the couch with a nice warm bellyful of my blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, how about this.\u201d The bed dipped again as Noelle stretched out beside her, turned, and draped an arm over her waist. \u201cI\u2019m gonna do you a solid and let you out of your promise to go to my mom\u2019s cocktail party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she offered, and it was the most she could do. She hadn\u2019t felt this lonely, this abandoned\u2014didn\u2019t matter if McKell had left willingly or not\u2014even when her father had taken off.</p> <p>While she\u2019d stood propped against that building, feet aching unbearably, heart aching worse, she\u2019d called Mia, asked if there was a way to track McKell or any of the others. The answer had been an unequivocal no. They\u2019d disappeared as if they\u2019d never been.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t cared, though, because the disease they\u2019d all feared had been seemingly eradicated in one swoop. AIR had broken down and tested Johnny upon his return and discovered McKell\u2019s blood had healed him.</p><p>When he realized he couldn\u2019t get her by phone, Johnny had tried to visit her a few times, but Noelle had barred him from the apartment. McKell would have beaten him into pulp for daring to try to steal what was his. If he\u2019d been here.</p><p>Great. More sobs.</p><p>\u201cMcKell\u2019s crazy about you,\u201d Noelle continued in that gentle tone. \u201cHe\u2019ll come back. One day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about him. I can\u2019t talk about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. I\u2019ll take mercy on you and change the subject.\u201d Soft fingers stroked her hair. \u201cSo get this. I was at AIR headquarters this morning, and Dallas and Hector Dean were both there. Both of them were watching me like I was a turkey and it was Thanksgiving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be used to that.\u201d The words were thick, her nose stuffed. \u201cAll men look at you that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but they also looked ready to kill me. As if I was a Thanksgiving turkey that hadn\u2019t yet had my neck snapped and feathers plucked.\u201d</p><p>She sniffed. \u201cWhy would they want to kill you? You\u2019re one of them now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s so crazy about the whole situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you misread them. Maybe they were looking at you but thinking of something else.\u201d</p><p>A pause. Then, \u201cMaybe. So let\u2019s backtrack to McKell.\u201d Noelle\u2019s mercy hadn\u2019t lasted long. \u201cHe can\u2019t exist without your blood, Ava. Like I said, he\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBride told me that vampires can drink a potion that removes the need for their ... mate\u2019s blood. That once they ingest it, they can drink from anyone they want again. And that they can never ... they can\u2019t ever ... they can\u2019t see their former mate ever again.\u201d</p><p>Part of her feared that had happened. That McKell had taken the potion. Part of her hoped that he had. Because three days had already passed, and he would soon weaken. Wherever he was, whoever he was with, he would need strength to stay safe. And she\u2019d rather be without him, knowing he was alive, strong, than delight in the knowledge that he would never be able to drink from anyone else.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Noelle, but I\u2019m terrible company right now. Could you maybe go?\u201d</p><p>Another pause. A sigh. \u201cOf course, baby doll, but I\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>Footsteps sounded, followed by the slide of her front door. All the sobbing had worn her out, and Ava drifted into a fitful sleep, letting the darkness wrap around her and offer what little comfort it could. Without McKell by her side, she tossed and turned, unable to truly rest despite her fatigue. A few hours passed, and she dazedly thought she should be hungry, but no. Her stomach hated the idea of food.</p><p>Hellina barked from the living room, growled, then whimpered happily. Ava didn\u2019t rouse from the bed.</p><p>\u201cAva!\u201d</p><p>She must be daydreaming, depression and heartache shooting her straight into a land of insanity. What did she care, though? She liked this daydream. That had been McKell\u2019s voice, as hard and uncompromising as she remembered and loved.</p><p>\u201cAva! Where are you?\u201d</p><p>Would her mind actually supply her with an image of him? \u201cMcKell,\u201d she called weakly. \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAva!\u201d</p><p>Boots thudded against her floor, and then her vampire was stalking into her bedroom. He flipped on the light, spied her on the bed, and his expression darkened with concern. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>This couldn\u2019t be a daydream, she thought then, common sense finally sparking to life. He was panting, pale, unsure, and she could smell the unique scent of him. He looked just as he had the first night she\u2019d met him. Shirtless, that necklace of bone hanging from his neck.</p><p>\u201cAre you real?\u201d she asked hesitantly, too afraid to hope.</p><p>\u201cYes. I met my father.\u201d The words poured from him in a frantic rush as he moved to the bed and crawled on top of her, as if he couldn\u2019t wait a second more to touch her. \u201cMy real father. He removed the Sch\u00f6n from this world, so you\u2019re safe for the moment, and then asked me to stay with him. I didn\u2019t want to, but I agreed. For you. For your life. You were going to be infected. Did you know that?\u201d</p><p>He was truly here, she realized. He was real. He was alive. His weight pinned her, his heat enveloped her, and his minty breath caressed her.</p><p>Oh, God.</p><p>\u201cMcKell!\u201d She threw her arms around his neck, and held on tight. His heartbeat hammered in time with hers. \u201cI missed you so much. I worried. I\u2014I\u2014\u201d She was sobbing again, but this time with were tears of joy.</p><p>Gently he brushed those tears away. \u201cI saw the past, the future. Reversed and forwarded. And the outcome was always the same, until my father intervened. But he could only endure my company for two weeks before my whining about being away from you irritated him beyond his never-before-encountered tolerance level. His phrasing, not mine.\u201d</p><p>Some of his words finally penetrated her happy fog. \u201cYour father is alive? And you\u2019ve been gone two weeks, according to your timetable, but three days according to mine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Confusing, she thought, but what did time matter? He was here! \u201cI\u2019m just so glad you\u2019re home. I love you. I love you so much.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her so tightly she lost her breath. \u201cI love you, too. So, so much, that I\u2019m dead without you.\u201d He pulled back to press little kisses all over her face, even as he kicked the covers away from her. \u201cI\u2019m going to have you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood girl, agreeing quickly.\u201d He licked her neck. \u201cDid I ever tell you that with you, there is no deal breaker?\u201d</p><p>She tugged at the waist of his pants. \u201cYou mean it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean it. Now let me prove it.\u201d</p><p>Without another word, McKell lifted Ava\u2019s shirt over her head and tossed the material aside. Her amber curls tumbled down her shoulders and arms. Leaning in, he inhaled deeply. Oh, that butterscotch. He would never get enough.</p><p>When she cupped her breasts, lifting them for his waiting mouth, his thoughts realigned. Oh, those breasts. He would never get enough. He tongued her nipples through her bra.</p><p>Those nipples beaded for him, which lit a fire in his blood. He almost laughed. When he was around Ava, there was always a fire in his blood. But in his exuberance, his fangs ripped through the fabric and scraped her skin. Not enough to break it, but just enough to cause her to shiver into goosebumps.</p><p>Her hands tangled in his hair, nails scouring, and she scooted her hips toward him. The core of her brushed his erection, and he moaned.</p><p>\u201cAva,\u201d he rasped. Just her name, but the plea was evident.</p><p>Shaky fingers finally popped off the button on his pants, and then those wonderful fingers were clutching his length, squeezing. So good. So damn good.</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYes. Yours. Always.\u201d</p><p>She must have liked his reply because she squeezed even tighter, dragging the first drop of pre-come from his cock. After that, he lost control. Not that he\u2019d ever had control with her.</p><p>His hands moved all over her, kneading her breasts, caressing her belly, tearing at her soft shorts and panties. Finally she was naked. All that sun-kissed skin ... those lithe thighs ... the sweet, glistening spot between her legs ... His.</p><p>\u201cSpread your legs for me, as wide as they can go,\u201d he commanded, even as he stood. She obeyed, and he quickly disposed of his shoes and the rest of his clothing.</p><p>She watched unabashedly, pinching her nipples before delving her fingers between those mouthwateringly beautiful folds. Her hips arched up. Her teeth nibbled her lower lip, those amber curls splayed around her delicate face. The most erotic sight he\u2019d ever beheld.</p><p>He was pretty sure he\u2019d thought that about her before, about something else she\u2019d done, but each new thing she did revealed a new pleasure to his eyes. Therefore, he was confident he would change his mind again, think the next thing she did was the most erotic.</p><p>\u201cWant to join me?\u201d she asked huskily. \u201cI need you. Missed you.\u201d</p><p>He fell back on top of her. She gasped, and he thought he might be crushing her so he flipped them over, allowing her to take the lead. She did. Eagerly.</p><p>Up she sat, placing his cock at her sex. Down she slid, unwilling to wait a moment more. He filled her, had to grip her hips to still her before she could begin moving. The exquisite pleasure ... He was ready to come from that alone. She surrounded him, enclosed him, held him tight.</p><p>She flattened her palms on his chest, gaze meeting his. \u201cI love you like this,\u201d she whispered. \u201cMine for the taking.\u201d</p><p>Oh, the words she used. Love. Mine. \u201cMore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>Up and down she moved, and he was lost, wild, needy, hers, desperate, arching up, thrusting deep. Her head fell back, hair tickling his thighs. Little hisses were escaping him, his claws so long they were probably cutting her, but he couldn\u2019t stop, couldn\u2019t even slow.</p><p>She didn\u2019t seem to mind. No, she seemed to love everything he did. Hips swirling, meeting him, taking him, demanding more. Have to taste, have to taste. McKell jerked upright, and as she sank deeper, he claimed her mouth with his own. Their tongues tangled, rolling together, dueling for supremacy.</p><p>Soon she was moaning every few seconds, gasping; he swallowed the sounds, loving how they hummed through his body, connecting them on yet another level. He was feverish, and she was both the fuel and the cure.</p><p>He reached between them and strummed her clitoris with his thumb. She bucked wildly, then, wrapping her arms around him, nearly choking him, shuddered her release. Screamed.</p><p>Her orgasm made way for his, and he jetted inside her.</p><p>\u201cAva!\u201d he shouted, muscles clenching painfully.</p><p>When the last drop left him, he fell backward on the bed, those muscles finally loosening their grip. Ava tumbled with him, remaining on top of him, utterly relaxed and, he liked to think, completely sated. He petted her hair. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t drink from me,\u201d she said with a pout.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saving that for round two.\u201d</p><p>McKell did bite her during round two. And round three. But their connection wouldn\u2019t be complete until she bit him. Ava knew that.</p> <p>She lay utterly exhausted on the mattress, her man perched above her, staring down at her. They\u2019d been too busy relearning each other\u2019s bodies to talk, but now that she\u2019d been reintroduced to every inch of him, it was time.</p><p>\u201cThose three days without you were miserable, you know,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI want you now, later, for more days and years than a human life can give me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sweetheart. There\u2019s no happier man than me in this world or any other. Believe me.\u201d Love shone in his eyes. So much love. And in that moment she knew beyond any doubt. He would never leave her, no matter how cranky she was. He would always want to be with her. Human, vampire, she was his.</p><p>A girl couldn\u2019t ask for more than that.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not going to turn you yet,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cNot until you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p> <p>Was it any wonder she loved him? \u201cThank you. And I will be. Ready, I mean. Soon. First, I need to work some things out with my job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Just as long as you never realize you\u2019re far too good for me, as a human or a vampire, I\u2019ll be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou keep saying things like that, and I\u2019ll quickly become your slave.\u201d</p><p>His lip quirked at the corners. \u201cImpossible. There can only be one slave in a relationship, and I\u2019m already yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you go again.\u201d Grinning, she caressed the curve of his cheek. \u201cI won\u2019t wait too long to vamp it up, I swear. Believe me, I\u2019m not going to become an old hag while you walk around so gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly serious, he rubbed two fingers over his chin. \u201cSo you think I\u2019m gorgeous, huh?\u201d</p> <p>She playfully punched his shoulder. \u201cJust hush that beautiful mouth. You know I do. I\u2019ve been hot for you from the first moment I saw you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProve it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf only I had the energy, you lech.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA vampire would have the energy,\u201d he teased. She\u2019d never seen him in so playful a mood, and she loved it.</p><p>That was why she spent the next half hour proving exactly what a human could do. And then, after round four, she was really exhausted.</p><p>Now, back in their previous position, a sigh slipped from her. \u201cSo what do we do now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRound five?\u201d He sounded as exhausted as she felt.</p><p>\u201cYou wish.\u201d</p> <p>He thought for a moment. \u201cNow we love each other, prepare AIR for the return of their greatest enemy, and then love each other some more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like that plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hoped you would, sweetheart. If you hadn\u2019t, I would have had to switch to Plan B.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTying you up with my whip, loving you, warning AIR, spanking you, and then loving you again. By the way, where is my whip?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Noelle stole it.\u201d She laughed, so happy she could have burst. \u201cWho would have thought I\u2019d end up with such a master strategist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe. Obviously I\u2019m the smart one of this pair. I fell in love with you, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but that\u2019s because you\u2019re also the pretty one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you did want a cute husband. You\u2019re so lucky,\u201d he told her with a grin.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said, sobering. \u201cI really do know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart,\u201d he replied, leaning down to kiss her. \u201cI\u2019m the lucky one, and I\u2019ll prove it.\u201d And just like that, they spiraled straight into round five. </p> </body></html>"]
