He had been a vampire for a very long time. Some believed he had been turned by Dracula, but Tom\u00e1s had been made long before the notorious count arrived on the scene. Ah, yes, if the truth were to be known, it was Tom\u00e1s who had bequeathed the Dark Trick to the world\u2019s most infamous vampire.</p><p>Tom\u00e1s grinned at the memory. Vlad Dracula had been born to be a vampire. Tom\u00e1s had turned many people in his time, but none had embraced the Dark Gift as fully or as eagerly as the Transylvanian warlord.</p><p>Tom\u00e1s blew out a sigh. In his long existence, he had traveled the world countless times, seen and done all there was to see and do. And now, after more than fifteen hundred years of existence, he was bored with life as he knew it.</p> <p>As a mortal man, he had been born to be a warrior, though he had always had a love for the sea. When he wasn\u2019t at war, he could be found out on the ocean. But it seemed there was always another war, and another.</p><p>When he turned vampire, being a warrior became a whole new adventure, and, for a time, he had put his love of the ocean behind him. Impervious to death, he had stalked the night, instilling terror in the hearts of his enemies even as he turned the land red with their blood\u2014what blood he didn\u2019t consume. He grinned into the darkness. Ah, in those days, he had glutted himself on the warm, rich red elixir, sated himself until he could hold no more. Drank until he was drunk with it, and in so doing, he became stronger than any other vampire who walked the face of the earth.</p><p>Gradually, ground warfare had lost its appeal, and he had gone to sea where, once again, he instilled terror into the hearts of his enemies. Sailing under a black pirate flag, he had terrorized English ports and ships, robbing wealthy Englishmen of their riches and their lives until that, too, lost its allure, and he had come to the New World seeking peace.</p><p>Tom\u00e1s drew in a deep breath, his nostrils filling with the scent of surf and sand. He\u2019d had enough of peace. It was time to fight again, time to rally the ranks of the Undead and spread a little terror among the masses.</p><p>His lip curled with pleasure at the mere idea. It was time to stir things up, to remind mankind that there really were monsters hiding under the bed and in the closet.</p> <p>Chapter 1</p><p>Reclining on a chaise longue on the balcony of his penthouse, a snifter of imported red wine in one hand, Rhys Costain stared out over the city of Los Angeles and contemplated the events of the last few months.</p><p>Mariah, the treacherous vampiress who had offered a sizable reward for his head, had been destroyed, sent to hell by Rhys\u2019s own hand.</p><p>Erik Delacourt, the only being\u2014man or vampire\u2014Rhys had ever called friend, had moved to Boston with his new bride, the delectable Daisy O\u2019Donnell. It was an odd match, Rhys mused, the vampire and the Blood Thief. Former Blood Thief, he amended, since she had given up that line of work when Delacourt turned her.</p><p>Ah, Daisy, Rhys thought. A tasty morsel, indeed. But she was a female, and, as a sex, they were more treacherous than the male and not to be trusted, a truth he had learned firsthand centuries ago.</p><p>He rarely let himself think of the fair Josette, but tonight, feeling maudlin and a little lonely, he unlocked the gates of the past and stepped inside.</p> <p>He had met Josette Rousseau in the summer of 1575 in Warwickshire. He remembered the year well because Robert Dudley had thrown a lavish party for Queen Elizabeth I at his castle in Kenilworth. The gathering had lasted three weeks. Of course, Rhys hadn\u2019t been invited. Commoners, whether vampire or mortal, didn\u2019t mingle with royalty, but everyone, highborn or low, talked about the gala event for weeks afterward.</p><p>Josette had been a young widow and a woman of means, with an estate in the country and a small townhouse in London. Rhys had been a young vampire back then, bold and impetuous. One look at Josette\u2019s clear porcelain skin and sparkling blue eyes and he had been hopelessly smitten. He could have mesmerized her and made her want him, but it hadn\u2019t been necessary. The attraction between them had been instantaneous and impossible to ignore.</p><p>He had met her on a Saturday night and taken her to his bed the following Friday. Because he had been young and proud, he had refused to move into her lavish estate. Instead, he had insisted they meet at his flat, humble as it was. Fearing that he might hurt her, or worse, turn her in a moment of weakness, he had been careful to feed each night before she came to him.</p><p>He had never known a woman like her, as elegant and proud as a queen when they were with the ton, as wanton as any common courtesan when they were alone.</p><p>Several months passed, and Rhys had been happier than he had ever been, either as a mortal man or a vampire, so in love that he no longer cared that she was wealthy, or that he was far beneath her socially. So in love that he had decided to put their differences aside and ask her to marry him. It was a bold move for a man whose mother had been a prostitute, a man who had once stolen from the rich to keep body and soul together.</p><p>He\u2019d had marriage on his mind the night he went, unexpected and unannounced, to her estate. It was a night he would never forget. Expecting to find his lady love in her bedroom dressing for dinner, he had floated up to her second-floor window, thinking how surprised she would be to see him at such an early hour.</p><p>The surprise had been his. He had found Josette in bed with a young duke, and in that instant, reality had come rushing in, and with it the certainty that she had never loved him. She had merely been using him for her own amusement. The lady and the commoner. Fueled by rage and a sense of betrayal beyond words, he had killed the young man. Deaf to Josette\u2019s cries for forgiveness, unmoved by her incoherent pleas for mercy, Rhys had let her see him for the monster that he was. Her terror had driven him over the edge. Taking her in his embrace, he had buried his fangs in her throat and taken what he had denied himself for so long. Took it all, until she lay limp and unmoving in his arms. Horrified by what he had done, he fled the house.</p><p>In the four hundred and thirty-five years since that night, he had never let himself care for another woman. He had seduced them. He had made love to them. He drank from them, but he had guarded his heart like a fortress. Four hundred and thirty-five years, he mused, sipping his wine. It was a long time to be alone and unloved.</p> <p>He thought again of Delacourt and his Daisy. Despite the fact that Delacourt was a vampire and Daisy had been a blood thief when they met, the two of them had fallen in love.</p><p>Rhys grinned inwardly. Knowing Daisy, it was hard to believe that she had once crept up on sleeping vampires, stolen a pint of their blood, and sold it on the Internet. But then, looks could be deceiving.</p><p>Rhys ran a hand through his hair. If Delacourt and Daisy could overcome obstacles like that, maybe it was time for him to try again.</p><p>Rhys snorted softly. What the hell was he thinking? If he had learned anything in the last five hundred and twelve years, it was never to make the same mistake twice.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>Megan DeLacey sighed when she glanced at her watch and saw that it was only a few minutes after midnight. Two hours until closing and, except for the owner, Shore\u2019s was empty. She didn\u2019t really like working nights and, if the pay and the perks hadn\u2019t been so good, she would have gone looking for a new job long ago.</p><p>Shore\u2019s was an exclusive men\u2019s shop that catered to wealthy clients\u2014mainly eccentric rock stars and theater and movie people who preferred to shop late at night, thereby avoiding those who were less rich and famous.</p><p>Robert Parker had taken his knowledge of menswear and his friendship with a well-known actor and parlayed that combination into a tidy little business. Shore\u2019s opened at ten A.M. and closed at four P.M. to accommodate those who preferred to shop during the day, and then reopened its doors at eight P.M. and stayed open until two in the morning. Megan and Mr. Parker worked the late shift.</p><p>Parker stocked only the finest men\u2019s apparel\u2014Shore\u2019s most inexpensive shirt sold for $375. Megan thought it was an outrageous price to pay for a short-sleeved cotton shirt, but then, she had been raised by a frugal mother and a father who was frequently out of work.</p><p>Parker also kept an assortment of spirits and black caviar on hand for his exclusive customers, as well as imported chocolates for the ladies. The chocolates were one of the perks Megan enjoyed the most, as Mr. Parker let her take home whatever was left at the end of the week.</p><p>Megan had worked at Shore\u2019s for just over a year, and, in that time, she had become a favorite of several of Mr. Parker\u2019s clients, including a well-known Hollywood producer, an Oscar-winning actor, and a famous country singer, all of whom had become regulars and insisted that she cater to their needs. In return, they showered her with expensive gifts\u2014jewelry, tickets to gala movie premieres, passes to concerts. She had felt guilty at first, accepting such costly gifts, but Mr. Parker had laughed at her reluctance.</p><p>\u201cHoney, to guys like these, a hundred bucks, heck, even a thousand, doesn\u2019t mean a thing.\u201d</p><p>Looking at it like that soothed her conscience. Mr. Parker was right. To an actor making fifteen or twenty million a picture, a few hundred dollars was just chump change.</p><p>A handful of her regular customers wanted more from her than her fashion expertise, but she refused to mix business with pleasure. One of her customers, an up-and-coming rock star, proposed to her every time he came into the store. He was cute and rich and very appealing, and she might have at least dated him except for one thing\u2014Drexel was only nineteen years old.</p><p>Of course, there were nights like tonight when the store was empty. Hopefully, Mr. Parker would decide to close early since his last appointment had left an hour ago and her midnight appointment had called earlier to say he had missed his flight from New York and wouldn\u2019t be able to make it.</p><p>Megan was rearranging a display of imported French silk ties when a young man entered the store, bringing a blast of wind and a rush of cold air in with him. One look, and she knew he had never been in the store before, just as she knew she would never forget him.</p><p>A quick glance showed that his tan slacks were Armani, his boots were Gucci, and his dark brown leather jacket was top of the line Hugo Boss. It was said that clothes made the man, but this man didn\u2019t need any help. He looked young, in his early twenties, but he exuded the confidence and authority of a much older man. His dark blond hair was short, though it had a slightly shaggy look, as if he were letting it grow out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He moved toward her on silent feet, every movement somehow sensual yet dangerous, as if he was a predator and she was his prey.</p><p>Where on earth had that thought come from?</p><p>Thrusting the foolish notion from her mind, she forced a smile. \u201cMay I help you?\u201d</p> <p>As he drew closer, Megan saw that his eyes were a deep dark brown, world-weary eyes that should have belonged to a much older man. She shivered when he turned the full force of his gaze on her.</p><p>\u201cI was just passing by.\u201d His voice, low and innately sensual, seemed to resonate within every fiber of her being.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t stop staring at him. He was incredibly handsome, but it was more than that. She was used to being in the company of handsome men, but there was something about this man that had every nerve and cell in her body tingling and on edge. A part of her wanted to throw herself into his arms, to beg him to stay with her forever, while another part of her wanted to run away and hide while she still had the chance.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of late for an evening stroll, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she asked, somewhat flippantly.</p><p>\u201cNot if one enjoys the quiet of a cool winter night.\u201d</p> <p>Something in his tone had her shivering again. \u201cI prefer warm summer days myself.\u201d She made a broad gesture with her hand. \u201cPlease, look around. Let me know if I can be of any help.\u201d</p><p>She was keenly aware of his gaze on her back as she walked toward the rear of the store. Suddenly nervous without knowing why, she began to set up a new display of cologne and aftershave. Even with her back to him, she sensed his presence as he moved up and down the aisles. There was something almost otherworldly about him, she thought, though she had no idea where that thought came from. He dressed as well, if not better, than most of her clients. He exuded an aura of power, but so did most of the men who frequented Shore\u2019s. After all, money was power. But it was more than that.</p><p>\u201cMiss?\u201d</p><p>Megan\u2019s hand flew to her throat at the sound of his voice so close behind her. Closing her eyes, she took a deep breath. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take these.\u201d</p><p>Pasting a smile on her face, Megan turned and found herself gazing up into his eyes. He was close. Too close. She couldn\u2019t think, could scarcely breathe. She glanced around the store, relieved to see Mr. Parker emerge from the back room.</p> <p>\u201cMiss?\u201d The stranger was watching her, a faint smile curving his lips, as if he knew just how much his nearness flustered her.</p><p>He liked Armani, she mused, as he held out a pair of black slacks and a black silk shirt, along with a black coat that cost more than she made in three months.</p><p>\u201cWill this be all?\u201d she asked, striving to keep her voice steady.</p><p>\u201cFor now.\u201d</p><p>She quickly rang up the sale, noting, as she swiped his credit card, that his name was Rhys Costain. His signature was a bold scrawl across the bottom of the receipt.</p><p>Willing her hands not to shake, she slipped his purchases into one of the dark blue garment bags inscribed with the silver Shore\u2019s logo.</p><p>When she handed him the bag, she was careful not to touch him. \u201cThank you, Mr. Costain. Please come again.\u201d</p><p>His gaze, as potent as a shot of Irish whiskey, bored into hers. \u201cCount on it,\u201d he said, and whistling softly, he turned and headed for the door.</p> <p>Taking a deep breath, Megan held onto the edge of the counter as she watched him walk away. Lordy, she didn\u2019t know who Rhys Costain was, but that voice, those eyes...She fanned herself with her hand as she willed her heartbeat to slow down, and fervently hoped never to see him again.</p><p>Standing in the shadows outside the store, Rhys watched the woman as she straightened a shelf here, rearranged a display of silk ties there, answered the phone. She was a remarkably pretty woman, probably thirtyish, with hair the bright reddish gold of autumn leaves and warm brown eyes. He usually preferred blondes in their early twenties, but in this case, he was willing to make an exception.</p><p>Was it luck, coincidence, or fate that had sent him into the store that night? Most likely it had been fate, now having a good laugh at his expense due to the fact that not more than twenty-four hours ago he had renewed his vow never to get involved with a mortal woman again; like it or not, he had become involved the minute he laid eyes on her.</p><p>Whistling softly, he headed for home. Time to clean out his closet, he mused, since he suspected he would be buying a whole new wardrobe in the next few weeks.</p><p>Megan was ringing up a sale for the lead guitarist in a popular rock band when she felt an odd sensation skitter down her spine. Looking up, she felt a nervous flurry in the pit of her stomach when she saw the young man who had come into the shop late last night. Rhys Costain.</p><p>Her smile was forced as she bid good night to her customer, then quickly turned away, pretending to check something on the computer, all the while hoping Mr. Parker would come forward to assist their customer.</p><p>But Mr. Parker remained in his office, with the door closed.</p><p>Megan didn\u2019t hear Costain\u2019s footsteps come up behind her, but she knew he was there. She could sense his presence, feel the intensity of his gaze on her back as he waited for her to acknowledge him.</p><p>Megan took a deep breath, counted to three, and turned around. \u201cGood evening, Mr. Costain,\u201d she said coolly. \u201cHow may I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow, indeed?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>His voice was smooth and soft, yet she detected a sharp edge underneath, like satin over steel. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for a black leather jacket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat length?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, a graceful, unhurried movement. \u201cMid-thigh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a few back here you might like.\u201d Without waiting to see if he followed, she walked toward the back of the store. Pulling their most expensive coat from the rack, she held it up. \u201cHow about this one?\u201d</p><p>He ran his hand lightly over the supple leather.</p><p>Watching him, Megan couldn\u2019t help imagining that pale, graceful hand stroking her bare skin.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cY...yes, very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mind if I try it on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>His hand brushed hers as he took the coat from the hanger. His skin was cool, yet a rush of heat flowed through her at his touch.</p><p>The coat fit as if it had been made for him, emphasizing his fair hair and broad shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Not trusting herself to speak, she nodded. What was there about this man that made her feel like a tongue-tied teenager?</p><p>She felt her cheeks grow hot when he looked at her and smiled, as if he knew exactly what she was thinking.</p><p>\u201cSo, you like it?\u201d</p><p>Striving for calm, she said, \u201cIt looks very nice. There\u2019s a mirror over there. See for yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need.\u201d Still smiling, he turned away, heading for the other side of the store.</p><p>Megan felt her blush deepen when he picked up several pairs of silk briefs, all black. Why was she acting so foolish? Men came in here and bought underwear all the time.</p><p>Frowning, she watched him pick up a dozen wife-beater T-shirts before moving to the checkout counter.</p><p>Regaining her senses, Megan stepped up to the register. \u201cAre you going to wear the coat?\u201d</p><p>With a nod, he removed the price tag and handed it to her.</p><p>She quickly rang up the sale, dropped his briefs and T-shirts in a bag, and offered it to him, careful, once again, to avoid his touch.</p><p>Again, his lips curved in that knowing smile.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Mr. Costain,\u201d she said, her voice tight.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Miss DeLacey.\u201d</p><p>The way he said her name made her insides curl with pleasure.</p><p>And then she frowned. \u201cHow did you know my name?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYou must have mentioned it.\u201d</p><p>She stared after him as he left the store. She was certain she hadn\u2019t told him her name. The fact that he knew it left her feeling violated somehow.</p><p>He returned to the store every night just after midnight for the next week, and he always bought something: a dark pinstriped suit; a dozen dress shirts\u2014black, brown, navy, and dark gray\u2014all silk. He bought four pairs of Armani slacks in varying shades of brown, as well as three pairs of black slacks, two belts, three ties, a pair of black slippers, a black silk dressing gown.</p><p>Tonight he picked out a Trafalgar American Alligator wallet priced at $550.</p><p>He gave her a long, lingering look that made her insides curl with pleasure before he left the store.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a big spender, that one,\u201d Parker said, coming up behind Megan. \u201cI wonder what he does for a living.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I hope he sticks around. We haven\u2019t had a week like this since Bono came in to do his Christmas shopping.\u201d</p><p>Megan nodded, though secretly she hoped that Mr. Rhys Costain would go back to wherever he had come from. His mere presence flustered her, and she didn\u2019t like it. She was far past the age to come unglued in the presence of a handsome man, especially when that man was at least ten years younger than she was.</p><p>It was close to three A.M. when Megan arrived at the small, two-story house she shared with her best friend, Shirley Mansfield. Shirl was a fashion model, which sounded a lot more glamorous than it was. Being a model involved dedication and self-denial, especially for Shirl, who was older than most of the popular models and had to work harder to keep fit. Of course, as far as anyone in the business knew, she was seven years younger than her actual twenty-eight years. Shirl rose every weekday at six and headed to the gym for a thirty-minute workout. Then she came home, took a shower, and ate a calorie-controlled breakfast. Then she was off to casting appointments and fittings, and, because she was extremely popular, more often than not she had a fashion shoot in the afternoon. She didn\u2019t usually make it home before five. Of course, the pay was excellent.</p><p>Megan didn\u2019t see much of Shirl during the week, since Shirl was usually in bed long before Megan got home from work.</p><p>After taking a quick shower, Megan slipped into a pair of comfy pj\u2019s and curled up in her favorite chair, determined to read for a few minutes before she went to bed. But she couldn\u2019t seem to concentrate on the words. Instead, Rhys Costain\u2019s image drifted through her mind. She told herself to forget him. For one thing, he was much too young for her; for another, there was an air of danger about him that scared her on some deep inner level she didn\u2019t understand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With a sigh of resignation, Megan closed the book and set it aside. Tomorrow was Saturday. She didn\u2019t have to work Sunday or Monday. If Shirl didn\u2019t have anything scheduled for Sunday night, maybe they could get together for dinner and a movie.</p><p>Later, lying in bed waiting for sleep to find her, Megan was irritated to find her thoughts again turning toward Rhys Costain. How did he spend his weekends? Was he buying all those new clothes to impress a new girlfriend? Or a new wife?</p><p>The thought of him with another woman was oddly disconcerting, and she shook it away. She didn\u2019t like him. Didn\u2019t like the way he made her feel, or the dark thoughts that flitted through her mind whenever he was near.</p> <p>Flopping over onto her stomach, she pounded her fist against the pillow. She had been spending far too much time thinking about the man.</p><p>Yet even as she tried to convince herself that she didn\u2019t care if she ever saw him again, a little voice in the back of her mind whispered that she was a liar.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>It was late Saturday night, his favorite night to hunt. Finding prey was never a problem, but it was always easier on the weekend, especially if you were hunting young males. They tended to party too much, drink too much, making them easy targets. But it was the tasty young women with them that Rhys generally preferred. Female blood tended to be warmer, sweeter on the tongue. And even when they were high, they smelled better than their male companions.</p><p>At midnight, Rhys lingered outside one of the more fashionable nightclubs, waiting. He intended to pay a visit to Shore\u2019s again, and it would be better for him, and for the woman, if he fed before he saw her. He didn\u2019t need to feed as often as he once had, but he was addicted to the hunt. He feared he was also becoming addicted to the woman. Megan. He had plucked her name from her mind on a recent visit. Megan DeLacey. He liked the sound of it, the way it rolled off his tongue, like poetry.</p> <p>He liked her.</p><p>And he intended to have her.</p><p>All of her.</p><p>But not just yet.</p><p>Moments later, a man and a woman in their midtwenties emerged from the bar, their arms wrapped around each other as they staggered down the street.</p><p>Pushing away from the side of the building, Rhys followed the couple to the parking lot, his fangs extending as he quickened his pace.</p> <p>Taking them was all too easy.</p><p>Megan was somewhat surprised when Rhys Costain arrived at Shore\u2019s half an hour or so before closing. Since he usually arrived just after midnight, she had assumed he wouldn\u2019t be coming, and had even managed to convince herself she was relieved, though her foolish heart had skipped a beat in nervous anticipation every time the door opened.</p><p>Each time a client had walked in, she had swallowed her disappointment and told herself she didn\u2019t care if ever she saw Rhys Costain again or not, even though she knew it was a lie. She had never been one to deceive herself, and it annoyed her to no end that she was doing it now. She didn\u2019t know the man. She wasn\u2019t even sure she liked him, so how to explain her illogical desire to see him again, or the way her heart seemed to skip a beat whenever he stepped through the door?</p><p>He was dressed all in black tonight. The color suited him perfectly. She watched him walk toward her, although walk didn\u2019t come close to describing the way he moved. He moved so lightly, so fluidly, she wondered if he studied ballet. Mikhail Baryshnikov meets Bela Lugosi, she thought, with a rueful grin.</p><p>\u201cGood evening,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cYour closet must be full to bursting by now,\u201d Megan remarked. \u201cI\u2019ve never known anyone to buy as many clothes as you do.\u201d</p><p>He smiled a slow, crooked smile that made her insides turn to jelly. \u201cSurely you realize that I only come here to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA date would be less expensive,\u201d she muttered, and then clapped her hand over her mouth. Where had that idea come from? And why on earth had she voiced it aloud?</p> <p>\u201cI should like that very much,\u201d he said. \u201cShall I pick you up after work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. You\u2019re a little too young for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m older than I look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old are you?\u201d It was an impertinent thing to ask a customer, but her curiosity refused to be stilled. He looked young, except for his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat does it matter? Age is only a number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you look to be about twenty, and since I\u2019m pushing thirty, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll have to pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure I can\u2019t change your mind? There\u2019s a little club not far from here where we can share a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon and get to know each other better.\u201d</p><p>Megan shook her head, though she couldn\u2019t help being flattered. He wasn\u2019t the first young guy who had asked her out, but, until now, she had never been tempted to accept. She found the idea of getting to know Rhys Costain quite intriguing, and scary as hell. \u201cThank you, but I don\u2019t think so. It\u2019s against company policy to date customers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed?\u201d</p><p>Megan nodded, certain he knew she was lying.</p><p>\u201cThen I guess I\u2019ll just have to buy something.\u201d He glanced around the store, then moved toward a display of Italian driving gloves.</p><p>He picked out a pair of black leather ones by Forzieri that sold for one hundred and twenty dollars, a pair of dark brown Bentleys that cost over three hundred, and a pair of gray wool Cavallis that went for a mere eighty-nine bucks.</p><p>\u201cNew socks, too, I suppose,\u201d he mused. Making his way to the far side of the store, he plucked a dozen pairs of black socks from the shelf, then added six pairs of dark brown, six pairs of navy, and three pairs of dark gray. \u201cI guess that will do it for tonight,\u201d he remarked, heading toward the checkout counter. \u201cHave to save something for next time.\u201d</p><p>Megan shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what else you could possibly need. Honestly, if you live to be a hundred, you\u2019ll never wear all the clothes you\u2019ve bought in the last week!\u201d She frowned when he burst out laughing. \u201cDid I say something funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea.\u201d He slid his credit card across the counter, signed the receipt, and bid her good night as he scooped up his bag.</p><p>He was still chuckling when he left the store.</p><p>As had become his habit, Rhys lingered in the shadows, watching her. What was there about Megan DeLacey that intrigued him so? True, she was lovely, but he had known a lot of lovely women in the last five hundred and twelve years. Maybe it was the way her eyes met his, a faint challenge in their depths. Maybe it was the tone of her voice, the smell of her skin, or the way her heart beat a little faster when he entered the store. Maybe it was the way she filled out that green wool dress, or the way her legs looked in those three-inch heels. Hell, maybe it was all of those things\u2014or none of them.</p><p>Of one thing he was certain. She was afraid of him.</p><p>Smart girl, he mused, as he turned away from the window and strolled down the sidewalk, still thinking of his undeniable attraction to Megan.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t gone far when two young men clad in dark jeans and leather jackets, their heads covered with black knit caps pulled down to their eyebrows, hurried past him. They reeked of cheap alcohol and cigarettes. The added scents of potassium nitrate, sulphur, and carbon told him one of them carried a gun.</p><p>A quick brush of his mind against theirs and Rhys tossed his packages in a Dumpster and turned to follow them.</p><p>Megan was getting ready to tally the night\u2019s receipts when the front door opened, admitting a pair of young men. One look and she knew trouble had just entered the store. The taller of the two remained near the door, one hand tucked inside his faded black leather jacket.</p><p>A thin white scar bisected the left cheek of the other young man. He swaggered toward her, a smirk on his swarthy face.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s make this short and sweet,\u201d he said. \u201cJust give me all the money in the drawer, and we\u2019ll be gone.\u201d</p><p>Megan had always thought people who put their lives in danger to protect large sums of cash were idiots, and she had no intention of doing so now. Mr. Parker was well insured, and he could always earn more money. She had only one life.</p><p>She had just opened the cash drawer when Mr. Parker emerged from his office.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of your business, old man,\u201d Scar Face said. \u201cSo shut your mouth before I shut it for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee here, you young punk!\u201d Parker retorted indignantly. \u201cGet the hell out of my shop before I call the police!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ain\u2019t callin\u2019 nobody, old man.\u201d</p><p>Parker\u2019s face turned a deep red as he pulled his cell phone from his pants pocket. \u201cWe\u2019ll see about that!\u201d</p><p>Megan let out a shriek as the thug near the entrance pulled a gun and leveled it at Mr. Parker.</p><p>What happened next happened so fast, Megan wasn\u2019t sure how much was real and how much she imagined. The front door opened, and a blur of black leather flew into the store seconds before the man fired the gun. In the space of a heartbeat, Mr. Parker had been pushed out of harm\u2019s way, the two would-be robbers were unconscious on the floor, and Rhys Costain stood in front of her, the robber\u2019s pistol in his hand.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She blinked at him. \u201cHow...? Where...?\u201d She glanced at the front door, still swinging, at the two young men, both out cold. At Mr. Parker\u2019s ashen face. At the ominous red stain spreading down Rhys\u2019s left arm.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019d better sit down,\u201d he said, slipping the pistol into his coat pocket. \u201cYou look a little pale. You, too, buddy.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Parker looked offended at being called \u201cbuddy,\u201d but he didn\u2019t argue. Sitting down in one of the store\u2019s padded chairs, he folded his arms over his chest, then, shoulders slumped, he cradled his head in his hands.</p><p>Megan looked up at Rhys. \u201cI should call the police.\u201d She started to touch his arm, then drew back. \u201cAnd an ambulance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Sit down before you faint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to faint!\u201d she exclaimed. Her knees were as weak as a newborn kitten\u2019s, and she felt light-headed. \u201cI\u2019m not going to faint,\u201d she repeated, and hoped it was true. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Taking her lightly by the forearm, Rhys guided her to a chair and gently pushed her down. \u201cJust rest a minute. These guys aren\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Megan took several deep breaths. Had she been alone, she would have put her head between her knees and sobbed, but she wasn\u2019t alone. She could feel Rhys Costain watching her, knew he was just waiting for her to faint or go into hysterics like some spineless female.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d His voice was soft and low as he laid a gentle hand on her shoulder. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re all right?\u201d</p> <p>His voice, his touch, went through her like an electric shock. Startled, she looked up, her earlier fear momentarily forgotten. Who was this man, that he should affect her so profoundly?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m...I\u2019m fine.\u201d She glanced at the two hoodlums who had come in to rob the store. They were still sprawled on the floor. Were they dead? She was vaguely aware that Mr. Parker was on the phone.</p><p>A short time later, two police officers arrived. Polite, but all business, they took her statement, then Mr. Parker\u2019s, then Costain\u2019s. One of the officers offered to drive Rhys to the hospital, but he refused, insisting he wasn\u2019t badly hurt. Megan didn\u2019t believe him. Neither did the police, but when Rhys removed his coat and shirt, there was little more than a shallow gash on his arm.</p><p>\u201cBut there was so much blood...\u201d Megan murmured, frowning.</p><p>\u201cJust a flesh wound,\u201d Rhys said with a grin.</p> <p>When the police were satisfied that they had all the information they needed, they handcuffed the two suspects, who had regained consciousness as soon as the police finished interrogating Rhys.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be in touch, Mr. Parker,\u201d one of the officers said, and then they marched the suspects out of the store.</p><p>Mr. Parker locked the front door behind the police, then walked back to where Rhys was standing. \u201cMr. Costain, I don\u2019t know how we can ever repay you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Mr. Parker said, pulling his checkbook from the inside pocket of his suit coat. \u201cI\u2019d be happy to give you a reward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you insist,\u201d Rhys said. \u201cHow about a new shirt?\u201d</p> <p>Mr. Parker blinked at him. \u201cA new shirt? That\u2019s all you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head, Mr. Parker fetched the most expensive shirt the store had to offer. Handing it to Rhys, he said, \u201cHow about a new coat? That one\u2019s ruined.\u201d</p><p>Rhys shrugged. \u201cSure.\u201d He didn\u2019t really need another coat, but what the hell? It would give him an excuse to see Megan again. \u201cI\u2019ll stop in and look around next time I\u2019m in the neighborhood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d Mr. Parker said. \u201cMegan, if you\u2019re ready, I\u2019ll take you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see her home,\u201d Rhys said.</p><p>Mr. Parker looked doubtful, but there was no arguing with Costain\u2019s expression or the implacable tone of his voice.</p><p>Taking Megan by the hand, Rhys lifted her to her feet. \u201cReady?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, but...\u201d</p><p>Before she quite knew how it happened, they were in her car, with Rhys behind the wheel.</p><p>\u201cI can drive,\u201d she protested.</p><p>\u201cNot tonight.\u201d He slid the key into the ignition.</p><p>Megan frowned. She didn\u2019t remember giving him her keys.</p><p>After a glance in the rearview mirror, he pulled away from the curb.</p><p>\u201cWhat made you come back to the shop?\u201d Megan asked. \u201cAnd what happened to all the things you bought earlier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dropped them off at my place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must live close by.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cClose enough.\u201d</p><p>She gave him the directions to her house, then wrapped her arms around her middle, suddenly chilled. Nerves, she thought, but that was to be expected. She had just been through a traumatic experience. She and Mr. Parker could have been hurt, killed. If Rhys hadn\u2019t come along when he did...</p><p>She shook her head. He had been shot because of her. She couldn\u2019t explain it, but she knew in the deepest part of her being that he had come back to the store because she had been in danger, which begged the question: how had he known?</p><p>Rhys slid a glance in her direction. \u201cYou doing okay?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, but she couldn\u2019t stop trembling. \u201cYou came back because of me, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated a moment before he said, \u201cI was hoping to change your mind about that drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could sure use one.\u201d She didn\u2019t believe for a minute that was why he had returned to Shore\u2019s. She was tempted to pursue the matter, but she just didn\u2019t have the energy.</p><p>They drove in silence for a few moments, and then she frowned. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you needed a drink. I know just the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s late. I don\u2019t think...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne drink,\u201d he said, \u201cand I\u2019ll take you home.\u201d</p><p>Looking at him, at the gleam in his fathomless dark eyes, she knew without a doubt that Rhys Costain was more dangerous than a dozen armed thugs.</p><p>Ten minutes later, he pulled up in front of a brick building. The name BLUE MOON flashed in turquoise neon above the entrance.</p><p>Rhys came around the front of the car and opened the door for her. She hesitated when he offered her his hand, reluctant to touch him without knowing why. When he continued to stand there, his arm outstretched, she heaved a sigh, then placed her hand in his. His fingers were cool as they closed over her own.</p><p>He handed her out of the car, then stripped off his ruined coat and bloody shirt and dropped them into the gutter. Opening the Camry\u2019s rear door, he pulled out the shirt Mr. Parker had given him. After removing it from the wrapper, he shook it out and slipped it on.</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d he said, running his hand over the navy blue silk. He gestured toward the club. \u201cShall we?\u201d</p><p>Megan gestured at the gutter. \u201cWhat about your clothes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have someone from the club dispose of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall we?\u201d</p><p>Still somewhat dazed, Megan nodded.</p><p>The Blue Moon was a small club that catered to jazz enthusiasts. Old black-and-white photos of famous, and not-so-famous, musicians lined the walls, interspersed with pages of sheet music autographed by singers and songwriters.</p><p>Rhys guided Megan to a vacant booth and slid in beside her. He could sense the tension rolling off her in waves. A part of it was due to the incident at Shore\u2019s, but Rhys knew his presence caused the majority of her nervousness. She was afraid of him without knowing why.</p><p>He smiled inwardly. He knew why. Some mortals were sensitive to the presence of his kind. On some instinctive level, they recognized the danger he represented. Most dismissed it, overwhelmed by his vampire glamour.</p><p>He ordered a bottle of vintage red wine, then settled back against the seat. His gaze trapped hers as, ever so gently, he whispered peace to her mind, his words easing away some of the tension that gripped her.</p><p>When she relaxed, he said, \u201cSo, tell me about yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing much to tell. I was married, but it didn\u2019t work out....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d It was a silly question. Few marriages lasted any length of time these days, but any man who let Megan get away was crazy.</p><p>\u201cOh, a lot of reasons. He was too young, not really ready to settle down. I wanted a home and a family. He didn\u2019t. He liked partying and riding motorcycles with his friends on the weekends.\u201d She lifted one shoulder and let it fall. \u201cIt was years ago. He\u2019s married now. They just had a baby. I guess I should have waited for him to grow up.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t miss the wistful note in her voice. \u201cYou never married again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Once was enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce burned, twice shy?\u201d he asked with a rueful grin.</p><p>\u201cSomething like that. How about you? Have you ever been married?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re young, rich, handsome....\u201d She shrugged. \u201cIt just seems like someone would have snatched you up by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m handsome?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a dark, devilish sort of way, yes.\u201d</p><p>Devilish. He laughed softly. If she only knew. \u201cGo on,\u201d he coaxed. \u201cTell me more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot to tell. I live with a friend of mine. I work.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cSounds boring, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, change it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say I didn\u2019t like it. I\u2019ve always enjoyed my job and the people. At least until tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe friend you live with...?\u201d He waited, jaw clenched, afraid of what he might do if her roommate was a man. Just because she hadn\u2019t married again didn\u2019t mean she wasn\u2019t involved.</p><p>\u201cShirley. We\u2019ve been friends since college. She\u2019s a high fashion model, very pretty. You\u2019d like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like you.\u201d</p><p>The words, the tone of his voice, the sultry look in his eyes, sent a shiver down her spine. She took a sip of her wine, hoping it would calm her. His thigh brushed against hers, but it was more than his nearness that unsettled her.</p><p>She eased her leg away from his. \u201cWhat about you? What do you do for a living?\u201d</p><p>A smile flitted across his face before he said, \u201cI own a little nightclub on the other side of town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? What\u2019s it called? Maybe I\u2019ve been there.\u201d</p><p>He laughed softly. \u201cI doubt it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? What kind of club is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a Goth hangout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoth?\u201d she asked, frowning. \u201cYou mean those weird people who dress all in black and pretend to be vampires, that kind of thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they into the blood thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of them are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShirl dated a guy who was a Goth a year or so ago. She was really into that kind of thing for a while. You know, the whole vampire mythology, but I can tell you, she broke it off with him pretty darn quick when he said he wanted to drink her blood.\u201d Megan grimaced. \u201cI\u2019m not sure vampires really exist. I mean, I\u2019ve never met one. Have you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWho can say? They don\u2019t advertise it, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I guess not.\u201d</p><p>Rhys refilled his glass, then looked at her, eyebrows raised. \u201cMore?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>He refilled her glass, wondering what she would say, what she would think, if she knew a five-hundred-year-old vampire was sitting beside her, contemplating how he might steal a taste of her blood.</p><p>When the band broke into something soft and slow, Rhys set his glass aside. \u201cCare to dance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to?\u201d She gestured at his arm. \u201cDoesn\u2019t it hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a quick healer. So, what do you say?\u201d</p> <p>She considered it a moment, then nodded.</p><p>On the dance floor, he took her into his arms without hesitation. Her body fit against his perfectly, as he had known it would. She was warm with the juices of life, supple in his embrace. He took a deep breath, his nostrils filling with the clean scent of jasmine, the musky scent of a young female. And blood.</p><p>Her gaze met his. He knew what she was going to ask even before she spoke. \u201cI have to know,\u201d she said, almost apologetically. \u201cJust how old are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty-five.\u201d The lie slid easily past his lips. He was too young for her at twenty, too old at five hundred and twelve. \u201cRelieved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You look younger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA blessing, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSome people never seem to age. Sometimes I hate to look in the mirror, you know? The other day, I found a gray hair.\u201d Shirl was even more afraid of growing old than Megan was, since when Shirl\u2019s looks went, so did her career.</p><p>\u201cNot to worry,\u201d he said with a faint smile. \u201cYou\u2019ll always be beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlatterer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI call \u2019em the way I see \u2019em.\u201d He regarded her a moment before asking, \u201cIf you could stay young forever, would you?\u201d</p><p>She considered it a moment, then shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Growing up, growing old, it\u2019s what life is all about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he remarked. \u201cLife.\u201d</p><p>The song ended, and he escorted her back to the table.</p><p>Life, Rhys thought as he drove her home a short time later. Its flame burned bright within her, drawing him in, warming the cold, desolate places in his soul.</p> <p>If he drank from her, he knew he would never be cold again.</p><p>Megan stood at the window, watching Rhys walk away. She had suggested he drive home in her car or call a cab, but he had dismissed her suggestions with a wave of his hand, saying the walk would do him good.</p><p>She had been a bundle of nerves during the drive home, wondering if Rhys would try to kiss her good night, wondering if she should let him. The knowledge that she had even considered it still astonished her. Maybe he wasn\u2019t as young as she had thought, but she hardly knew the man. Still, a hero deserved a reward, and after what he had done tonight, he was definitely a hero.</p><p>Awfully full of yourself, aren\u2019t you, Megan? Thinking one of your kisses would be ample reward for saving your life!</p><p>As it turned out, she needn\u2019t have worried. When they reached her house, Rhys walked her to the door, made sure she was safely inside, and bid her a chaste good night.</p><p>She watched him until he was swallowed up in the darkness; then, after double-locking the front door, she went through the rest of the house, making sure all the windows were closed and locked, drawing the drapes to shut out what was left of the night. Funny, that while sitting in the club with Rhys, the events at the store had seemed distant, almost as if they had happened to someone else, but here, in her own home, she was suddenly afraid. She knew there was evil and violence in the world. She saw it in living color on the nightly news, but, until this evening, she had never experienced it firsthand.</p><p>She could have been killed tonight. They could all have been killed.</p><p>Folding her arms over her chest, she rubbed her hands up and down her arms. Maybe it was time to buy a gun, or at least a canister of pepper spray.</p><p>After changing into a T-shirt and a pair of pajama bottoms, she went into the kitchen and fixed a cup of hot cocoa. She was sitting at the table, waiting for the chocolate to cool, when Shirl shuffled into the room. Even without makeup, her blue eyes puffy from too little sleep, and her long, silver-blond hair mussed, Shirl was gorgeous.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Megan said. \u201cDid I wake you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Shirl replied, smothering a yawn with her hand. \u201cI have to be up in a couple of hours anyway.\u201d She dropped into the chair across from Megan\u2019s. \u201cWhat are you doing up so late? Or so early? Did you just get home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Megan wrapped her hands around the mug. \u201cWe had some trouble at the store tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Shirl stared at her, suddenly wide awake. \u201cWhat happened? Did anyone get hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, come on, girl, I want details.\u201d</p><p>With a sigh, Megan quickly told her about Shore\u2019s newest client and how he had come to the rescue. \u201cJust like Batman,\u201d she finished, \u201cbut without the mask, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad,\u201d Shirl said with a grin. \u201cI like men in masks.\u201d</p><p>Megan had to laugh at that. It was one of things they had in common, liking masked heroes. Batman, Spiderman, the Lone Ranger. They all wore masks.</p><p>\u201cDid he at least have a cape?\u201d Shirl asked hopefully.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Fraid not,\u201d Megan said, smothering a yawn. \u201cI think I\u2019m ready for bed. Do you want to go out tomorrow night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. I have a date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d Megan exclaimed. \u201cWith who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeez, don\u2019t look so surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it has been a long time. For both of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis name is Greg, and he\u2019s a patrol sergeant with the LAPD. Six-foot three, brown hair, brown eyes. Divorced. No children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen do I get to meet him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll see how it goes tomorrow night. So, what about this guy, Rhys? Any vibes there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Megan replied, shaking her head. \u201cHe\u2019s only twenty-five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re four years older than he is. So what?\u201d</p><p>Megan shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t believe him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think he\u2019s older?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, younger. A lot younger. But it\u2019s more than that. He\u2019s...\u201d She bit down on her lower lip as she tried to find the words to describe Rhys Costain. \u201cDifferent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDifferent how? Two heads? Three arms? One eye in the middle of his forehead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, nothing like that. I don\u2019t know how to explain it. He scares me, and I don\u2019t know why.\u201d She ran her fingertip around the edge of her cup. \u201cYou\u2019re going to think I\u2019m crazy, but...he changed his shirt after he was shot...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so crazy about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush. I saw his arm when he changed his shirt and I swear\u2014I swear!\u2014the wound in his arm was gone. I mean, gone like it was never there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! Well, I could be wrong. It was dark, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had a rough night, girlfriend. Maybe your eyes were playing tricks on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Megan blew out a sigh. \u201cSometimes, when I\u2019m with him, I get the feeling he\u2019s hiding something. Something dark and dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, if you\u2019re having scary thoughts about this guy, then I\u2019d say follow your instincts and stay away from him.\u201d</p><p>Good advice, Megan thought as she rinsed out her cup and made her way upstairs. Good advice, indeed.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>Although Rhys had little to do with the affairs of mortals in general, he made it a point to keep abreast of what was happening around the world, especially in the United States. Especially now, when he was no longer just Master of the City, but Master of the West Coast Vampires.</p><p>He grunted softly as he recalled the battle that had increased his territory. It hadn\u2019t been a battle he had sought, but he had never run from a fight. He had destroyed the other vampire without a qualm, and now his domain included Oregon, Washington, and Idaho as well as California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Montana.</p><p>He was always amazed at the violence humans were capable of. His kind were supposed to be the monsters, yet man\u2019s cruelty to his fellow beings made vampires seem benevolent by comparison.</p><p>Someone had once said there was nothing new under the sun. It was proved nightly, on the news. This evening was no different. Gang killings. Teachers having affairs with underage students. Congressmen being arrested for nefarious dealings. The rich preying on the poor. War in the Middle East. The price of gas going up and down like a yo-yo on steroids.</p><p>Rhys was about to turn off the set when the perfectly coiffed female anchorwoman said, \u201cThis just in from our sister station in New York City. The bodies of a man and a woman were discovered near the Hudson River only moments ago. According to undisclosed sources, both victims appear to have been drained of blood.\u201d</p><p>It was the last three words that caught his attention. They seemed to echo off the walls.</p><p>Drained of blood.</p><p>Rhys leaned forward, his gaze focused on the screen. In his gut, he knew those three words could mean only one thing. There was a vampire on the rampage somewhere in the city of New York.</p><p>Switching off the screen, Rhys opened the French doors and stepped out onto the balcony. The cops would never catch the vampire responsible for the killings, just as they would never solve the crime. It would take another vampire to bring the rogue down. Or a damn good hunter.</p><p>He grinned faintly, thinking it was too bad for the NYPD that Daisy and her family had given up hunting.</p><p>Thoughts of Daisy brought Megan to mind, not that he needed help to think of her. Megan had been uppermost in his mind since that first night. He wondered what she was doing this evening, since Shore\u2019s was closed on Sundays and Mondays.</p><p>Curious, he went into his bedroom to change clothes. Before he\u2019d met Megan DeLacey, his wardrobe had been sparse\u2014a few pairs of good slacks, a dozen shirts. But now...He shook his head. His closet held enough outfits to clothe three or four men for a year. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Until Megan, he had never given much thought to what he wore. Now, he found himself wondering what she would find most appealing.</p><p>Exasperated, he pulled on a pair of black slacks and a dark gray shirt, stepped into a pair of black boots, and made his way to the underground garage and his private parking place. Being the owner of the building definitely had its compensations, he thought, as he slid behind the wheel of the Jag and backed out of the garage.</p><p>Moments later, he pulled up in front of Megan\u2019s house.</p> <p>Lifting his head, he expanded his senses, swore softly when he realized the place was empty. After rolling down the window, he sniffed the air, sorting through the myriad scents that swirled through it for the one he sought.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long. With a wry grin, he put the Jag in gear and followed her scent across town to the multiplex.</p><p>He parked next to her car, then hurried inside, only to come to an abrupt halt when he entered the darkened theater. He hadn\u2019t detected the scent of anyone else in her car, but what if she had come here to meet another man? Hands clenched, he searched for her. With his preternatural vision and enhanced sense of smell, it took only moments to locate her.</p><p>On silent feet, he slid into the empty seat beside her.</p><p>Megan didn\u2019t have to see Costain\u2019s face to know he was there. She didn\u2019t even wonder why he had come, or how he had known where she was. Quite the contrary. It seemed perfectly natural that he should appear, seemingly out of thin air. One minute she had been thinking of him, and the next he was there beside her, as if her thoughts had summoned him.</p> <p>\u201cDid I miss much?\u201d he whispered, leaning toward her.</p><p>\u201cOnly the first hour,\u201d she whispered back, and suddenly the depression that had sent her to the movies was gone as if it had never been, and all because of a man she hardly knew. \u201cHow\u2019s your arm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh, it\u2019s fine. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like some popcorn?\u201d</p><p>He wrinkled his nose at the smell of butter and salt. \u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>She wondered what he would say if she suggested they leave. The only reason she had come to the theater was because she hadn\u2019t wanted to stay home alone. She hadn\u2019t wanted to interact with anyone, either, so coming to the movies had seemed the ideal solution. She could sit in the dark, surrounded by people, without having to say a word. And hopefully forget about last night. But now Rhys was here, and everything had changed.</p> <p>She was thinking about asking him if he wanted to leave when he beat her to the punch.</p><p>Leaning toward her, he whispered, \u201cWhat do you say we get out of here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>She dumped her popcorn in a trash can on the way out.</p><p>\u201cWhere would you like to go?\u201d Rhys asked when they were out on the sidewalk.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go to my place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p> <p>He grinned at her. His teeth were very white, even in the darkness. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean my house. I meant my club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. All right.\u201d</p><p>He smiled inwardly as they walked to the parking lot. Although she didn\u2019t know it, she wouldn\u2019t be any safer in his club than in his lair.</p><p>\u201cNice car,\u201d Megan murmured as he opened the passenger door for her.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s not bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot bad?\u201d The Jag was beautiful. Smoke gray in color, it seemed to glow in the moonlight. When she slid into the seat, the soft leather seemed to enfold her. \u201cOh! What about my car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can pick it up later.\u201d</p><p>Megan was wondering if she had made a mistake as Rhys pulled onto the highway. In minutes, they had left the city behind. Hands clenched in her lap, she looked out the window, her tension growing as the miles slid by. She had expected his club to be located closer to home, not out on some deserted stretch of road. Her uneasiness increased when he pulled up in front of a place called LA MORTE ROUGE.</p><p>\u201cThe Red Death?\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cI told you, it\u2019s a Goth hangout.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, not at all reassured by his explanation.</p><p>He turned to face her, his dark eyes glittering in the light of the dash. \u201cHave you changed your mind?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard. \u201cI...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll take you home if that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>She knew that would be the smart thing to do, but she didn\u2019t seem to have much sense when it came to Rhys. Besides, she was suddenly curious to see the inside of the club. \u201cLet\u2019s have a drink first.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, he switched off the engine.</p><p>As she watched him walk around the front of the car to open her door, she couldn\u2019t shake off the feeling that she was Little Red Riding Hood and he was the Big Bad Wolf.</p><p>A tall man clad in a black suit, an impeccable white tie, and a long black cloak opened the door. Inclining his head, he murmured, \u201cGood evening, Mr. Costain,\u201d and bowed them through the doorway.</p><p>Megan took a deep breath before following Rhys inside. A narrow hallway illuminated by candlelight opened onto the club\u2019s main floor. Megan glanced around, noting a long bar at the far end of the room. High-backed booths lined one wall. A grand piano stood on a raised platform in the far corner.</p><p>As was to be expected, the lighting in the club was subdued. Music filtered through the sound system; though it was low, it had a dark, sensual beat. Several couples sat at the small tables located at intervals around the room. Each table was covered with a black damask cloth; each held a blood-red rose in an ebony vase. Dark red paper covered the walls. She noticed several numbered doors, but hesitated to ask what lay behind them.</p><p>The women she passed as she followed Rhys were all beautiful, and they all wore provocative clothing, mostly black, which she supposed wasn\u2019t all that unusual considering this was a Goth club. Megan thought it was odd that the women all wore broaches inscribed with their names, and that all the names were French\u2014Monique, Angelique, Capucine. The men, too, wore mostly black. She noted they also sported tags with French names. Maybe they were all into role-playing, she thought, and the names were those of the characters they played.</p><p>\u201cSo, what do you think?\u201d Rhys asked as he led her to a booth in the back corner that she suspected was reserved for his use only.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s...I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never been in a Goth club before.\u201d</p><p>She slid into the booth, and Rhys slid in beside her. The high, curved back provided them with a good deal of privacy.</p><p>A waitress arrived at their table almost before they were seated. \u201cWhat can I get for you tonight, Mr. Costain?\u201d she asked in a deep, throaty voice.</p><p>Rhys looked at Megan. \u201cWhat\u2019ll you have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you\u2019re having.\u201d</p><p>Megan didn\u2019t miss the subtle shake of Costain\u2019s head as he ordered a glass of red wine for her and one for himself. She wondered what it meant. Was he telling the waitress to put something in her drink?</p><p>Megan tapped her fingernails on the tabletop. If she asked him to take her home, would he still be agreeable? Why had she wanted to come here? Across the way, a couple rose and went into room number six.</p><p>\u201cMegan?\u201d</p><p>She jumped at the sound of his voice.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...Yes, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look a little pale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I?\u201d She lifted a hand to her forehead. Of course, she could plead a headache. Wasn\u2019t that the excuse women always fell back on? \u201cNow that you mention it, I am feeling a little under the weather all of a sudden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe the wine will make you feel better,\u201d he suggested. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t, I\u2019ll take you home.\u201d</p><p>The waitress arrived with their drinks a short time later. Megan stared at the glass the woman placed before her. Was it drugged?</p><p>Rhys didn\u2019t miss the worried look in Megan\u2019s eyes. A quick brush of her mind with his explained everything. She had seen the look he\u2019d given Lena and assumed it was some silent order to drug her drink. As if he would have to resort to drugs if he had anything nefarious in mind. His unspoken communication to Lena had merely been to alert her to the fact that he also wanted wine and not his usual. Now, how to assure Megan she had nothing to worry about without arousing her suspicion?</p><p>Before he could decide, Megan reached for her drink. And knocked it over.</p><p>\u201cOh, how clumsy of me!\u201d Grabbing her napkin, Megan dabbed at the dark stain spreading over the tablecloth.</p><p>\u201cNothing to worry about,\u201d Rhys said. \u201cHere, have mine.\u201d</p><p>He slid his glass across the table before she could object.</p><p>She looked up, her eyes narrowed.</p><p>Rhys smiled benignly, curious to see if she would pull the same stunt twice.</p><p>Megan hesitated a moment, and then, with a murmured, \u201cThank you,\u201d she picked up his glass and took a sip. She wasn\u2019t much of a wine connoisseur, but she thought she tasted a hint of cherries and cinnamon.</p><p>At his signal, the waitress arrived with a fresh tablecloth and another glass of Pinot Noir.</p><p>Rhys leaned back in his chair. She was as nervous as a kitten in a den of coyotes. Bringing her here probably hadn\u2019t been the best idea he\u2019d ever had. But it wasn\u2019t just her surroundings. She was still upset over what had happened at the store last night, although she didn\u2019t want to admit it, even to herself.</p><p>With his preternatural power, he reached out to her, willing her to relax.</p><p>Megan didn\u2019t know if it was the wine or the heat in Costain\u2019s eyes, but after a few sips, she suddenly felt lethargic.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should take you home so you can get some sleep,\u201d Rhys said, and taking the glass from her hand, he led her outside to the car, buckled her seat belt, and drove her home.</p><p>A light burned in the window. Inside, Shirl had left a note saying she wouldn\u2019t be home until morning.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to be all right, here alone?\u201d Rhys asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d Megan replied.</p><p>\u201cWould you feel better if I stayed a while?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She hesitated a moment before asking, \u201cWould you mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Go on up to bed. I\u2019ll stay until first light.\u201d He couldn\u2019t blame her for not wanting to be alone. After all, she\u2019d had a hell of a scare last night.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll keep the bogeyman away.\u201d</p><p>With a nod, Megan went upstairs and, after a moment\u2019s indecision, locked her bedroom door. Better to err on the side of caution, she thought, and then shook her head, certain that, if he wanted in, no locked door would keep him out. She still couldn\u2019t believe she had asked a man she scarcely knew to spend the night.</p><p>She brushed her teeth, combed out her hair, slipped into a pair of pj\u2019s, and crawled into bed, asleep as soon as her head hit the pillow.</p><p>Rhys made himself comfortable on the sofa. With his preternatural hearing, he could track Megan\u2019s movements as she went from bathroom to bedroom. He heard the rustle of sheets as she slid under the covers. For a moment, he considered going upstairs, mesmerizing her with a look, sliding into bed beside her, taking her in his arms, and making love to her, but it was only wishful thinking. When he took Megan DeLacey to bed, he wanted it to be her idea. A short burst of preternatural energy brought the TV to life. He surfed through the channels\u2014game shows, reality shows, world news. Muttering an oath, he switched it off. He sat there a moment, fingers drumming restlessly on the arm of the sofa.</p><p>Getting to his feet, he wandered around the room. It was totally feminine, from the pale yellow walls, flowered sofa, and colorful throw pillows, to the knickknacks on the mantel and the fancy curtains at the window. He stopped in front of a bookshelf and spent a few minutes perusing the titles. Her taste ran to mysteries and romances, neither of which appealed to him.</p> <p>He was about to turn the TV on again when a muffled cry reached his ears. Megan!</p><p>A thought carried him up the stairs to her room. The door was locked, but he had yet to come across a lock that could keep him out when he wanted in.</p><p>A whisper of preternatural power opened the door, and he stepped into her room. A quick glance showed it was just as feminine as the living room. The walls were pink, the carpet a deep mauve. Flowered curtains hung at the single window. A matching quilt in colors of pink, mauve, and forest green lay folded over the foot of the bed. An antique dresser stood against the wall opposite the bed; a small desk occupied one corner, the seat cushion on the chair covered in the same material as the curtains.</p><p>On silent feet, he made his way to Megan\u2019s bedside. She looked incredibly young and innocent lying there, her hair like a splash of reddish gold silk across the flowered pillowcase, the blankets pulled up to her chin. Of course, everyone seemed young and innocent when compared to him and the life he had led, he mused ruefully. No one could do the things he had done, see the carnage he had seen, and remain innocent.</p><p>Megan moaned softly. Caught in the throes of a bad dream, her body moved restlessly beneath the covers.</p><p>\u201cMegan.\u201d He whispered her name as he toed off his boots. After stretching out beside her, he drew her body against his, one arm holding her close while he lightly stroked her hair. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, darlin\u2019. I\u2019m here. No one will hurt you,\u201d he promised. Not even me.</p> <p>Still asleep, she quieted at the sound of his voice, and then she snuggled against him, her body warm and soft and oh, so alive. And in that moment, as her scent enveloped him, he knew that, for better or worse, he wanted more from Megan DeLacey than her life\u2019s blood.</p><p>He stayed at her side until a familiar tingling along his spine warned him of dawn\u2019s approach.</p><p>Rising, he pulled on his boots, then rained featherlight kisses along the alluring curve of her slender throat. A thought took him to the theater parking lot where they had left her car the night before.</p><p>Taking time to drive her car home was cutting it close, he mused. He parked her car in the driveway, left her keys on the kitchen table, then slid behind the wheel of the Jag and put the pedal to the metal.</p><p>She was sweet, he thought, as he sped toward his penthouse. So sweet. And one day soon, she would be his in every way that mattered.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>It was near midnight when Rhys transported himself to his second lair. The house was little more than an empty shell. Except for three large, tan leather sofas and a couple of overstuffed chairs, there was no furniture in the room. No pictures on the walls. No lights save for a large wrought-iron candelabra. A medieval sword hung over the fireplace. The grip was made of wood covered in shagreen leather. It wasn\u2019t merely for decoration. Rhys had used it on more than one occasion. He had, in fact, used it to take the head of the vampire who had recently betrayed him. Rhys used the house as a meeting place to conduct vampire business; on occasion, he took his rest in the walk-in pantry that had been converted to serve that purpose, but not often. There\u2019d been a time when he\u2019d kept a Mastiff to guard the house, but someone had poisoned the dog and he hadn\u2019t gotten around to finding another one.</p><p>Tonight, he had called a meeting of the West Coast Vampire Council to see if any of the members had information on the killings in the East. A rogue vampire was bad news for all of them. He didn\u2019t summon the Council to LA unless there was trouble of one sort or another brewing. And the killings in the East smelled like trouble. Big trouble.</p> <p>While waiting for the Council to arrive, he let himself think of the night past. He had held Megan in his arms until just before dawn. It was a testament to his self-control that all he did was hold her when his body had urged him to take her while she slept, while his hunger had urged him to feed. Monster he might be, but to take advantage of Megan while she slept was unthinkable. Tempting as she was, he wouldn\u2019t defile her in such a despicable way.</p><p>He tucked thoughts of Megan safely away as the members of the Council arrived.</p><p>Five members of the Council had been destroyed not long ago. Damon had been killed by Erik Delacourt. Saul had been destroyed by Daisy. Tina and Craig had been terminated by Daisy\u2019s brother, Alex. Rhys had destroyed Mariah for her betrayal. News of her destruction, which had been slow and painful, had spread quickly through the vampire community, a warning to others who thought to betray him.</p><p>Rhys surveyed the remaining members of the original Council. The handsome vampire with dark, slicked-back hair and a thin mustache was Rupert Moss. He reminded Rhys of a young Valentino. Rupert kept his lair in Idaho.</p><p>The tall, angular vampire with wispy gray hair and pale blue eyes was Nicholas. He had been turned when he was in his late seventies, something Rhys had always found a little creepy. He could understand why humans didn\u2019t want to die, but to be immortal at seventy? What was the point? Nicholas spent most of his time in Arizona.</p><p>Julius Romano was a California boy who had started dealing drugs in high school. Of medium height, with brown eyes and short brown hair, he had been turned when he was twenty-three. A red-and-black snake tattoo ran the length of his left arm.</p><p>Rhys had appointed four new members of the Council shortly after he\u2019d destroyed Mariah.</p><p>Adrianna made her home in New Mexico. She was fire and ice, that one, with her flaming red hair and cold blue eyes. She had a penchant for diamonds and furs and was rarely seen without one or the other. She had been a vampire for one hundred and fifty years, and she reveled in it. Rhys didn\u2019t like her and he didn\u2019t trust her, which was why he had brought her into the Council where he could keep an eye on her. If there was one thing about women he was certain of\u2014it was that the female was always deadlier and more cunning than the male. Mariah had been proof of that.</p><p>Mark Winchester resided in Montana. He was a good-looking kid, with his wheat-blond hair and dark brown eyes. Winchester had been a year younger than Rhys when he was turned. Built like a Mack truck, Winchester had been a college quarterback in mortality. He had been turned by an admirer after a football game. Fifteen years later, he was still bitter about having to give up football, but there was no help for it. After all was said and done, there were only so many excuses he could use for constantly missing practice and day games.</p><p>Stuart Hastings made his lair in Medford, Oregon, where he had once been a renowned surgeon. He hated what he had become. Rhys couldn\u2019t blame him. For a man whose sole reason for living had been saving lives, becoming one of the Undead seemed like a cruel trick.</p><p>Seth Adams had been a Union soldier during the Civil War. He would have died at Gettysburg if a hungry vampire hadn\u2019t found him, bleeding and near death, on the battlefield. Adams resided in Washington.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Adrianna said, looking bored, \u201cwhy have you called us here?\u201d</p><p>Rhys told them as succinctly as possible about the killings in the East. \u201cHave any of you heard anything?\u201d he asked, glancing around the room. \u201cWinchester?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Rhys shook his head. \u201cStop texting, and pay attention. I asked if you\u2019ve heard anything about the killings in New York.\u201d</p><p>The kid shrugged one big, burly shoulder. \u201cNah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you, Adrianna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. How do you know it\u2019s a vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.</p><p>\u201cI had an e-mail from an old friend who lives in New York,\u201d Rupert said. \u201cHe heard the report on a police scanner and went to the scene. It was definitely the work of a vampire. Neat. Clean. He was positive that an old one was responsible.\u201d</p><p>Rhys nodded. An old one. There were a number of aged vampires on the East Coast. Of course, that didn\u2019t prove anything. Few vampires stayed long in one place. \u201cWhat about you, Julius?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t heard anything, but I say we stop sneaking around and join up with whoever it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not looking for a war,\u201d Rhys retorted. \u201cI\u2019ve had enough of that. Nick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t heard anything other than what was said on the news, but to my way of thinking, there\u2019s no point in worrying about it now. Unless the rogue comes here, I don\u2019t see how it concerns us.\u201d</p><p>Rhys swept his gaze over the Council. \u201cWe\u2019ve lived under the radar for quite a while. I\u2019m older than any of you. I remember what it was like to be hunted by hysterical mobs wielding scythes and torches. It isn\u2019t something I want to experience again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSounds dreadful,\u201d Nicholas said. \u201cWhat do you want us to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now, just keep your eyes and ears open. If you hear of anything the least bit suspicious, tell me immediately. The last thing I want is a bunch of humans running scared. They might be weak and sometimes stupid, but they\u2019re persistent when they get their tails in a knot. One more thing, there\u2019s a new hunter here in LA.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone we know?\u201d Nicholas asked, and then frowned. \u201cIt\u2019s not that Blood Thief, is it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Rhys said, grinning, \u201cit\u2019s not her.\u201d Those who knew Daisy had good reason to fear her. In spite of being young and a woman, she had been a force to be reckoned with.</p><p>Rhys remembered Daisy well. He had been at rest here, in the pantry of the meeting house, minding his own business, when her brother, Alex, had attacked him. The two of them had been locked in a life-and-death battle when Daisy burst into the room and hurled a bottle of holy water at his head. Rhys had howled in pain and fury as the water burned his skin. With murder on his mind, he had whirled around to face her. He could only imagine how frightful he must have looked, with his eyes glowing like hell\u2019s own flames and his fangs dripping with her brother\u2019s blood. But it hadn\u2019t slowed her down. With a wild cry, she had pulled a stake from her pocket, lunged forward, and driven the damn thing into his chest. Had her hand been steadier, her aim true, she would have destroyed him on the spot.</p><p>Funny, how things never turned out the way you expected. He had fully intended to avenge himself on the Blood Thief and her brother; instead, they had become reluctant allies. But that was all in the past.</p><p>His gaze rested briefly on each member of the Council. \u201cAll right, you all know what to do. Now get out of here.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 6</p> <p>Tom\u00e1s Villagrande strolled through the streets of New Orleans admiring the lacy iron balconies that fronted so many of the buildings, the Spanish moss that hung from the branches of the trees, giving them a somewhat gothic look that appealed to him.</p><p>In the old days, the city, founded in 1718 under the direction of Jean Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville, had been known as La Nouvelle-Orl\u00e9ans. Tom\u00e1s had walked its streets then, too.</p><p>The city had changed much in 292 years.</p><p>He had not.</p><p>A thought took him to the French Quarter, his favorite part of the city. He strolled down Bourbon Street, which was virtually unchanged from days gone by and was still the center of town. Rows of townhouses and cottages lined the sidewalks, many with elaborate wrought-iron balconies, flagstone courtyards, and bubbling fountains.</p><p>The first floors of many houses had been turned into commercial enterprises, with living quarters upstairs.</p> <p>No matter the time of day or night, the streets in the Quarter were always crowded. Tourists quickly learned three things about this part of the city\u2014the bars never closed, the food was spicy, and there was music everywhere. Jackson Square was another area that bustled with activity, a place where fortune tellers, jugglers, musicians, and artists gathered to perform and sell their wares.</p><p>A thought took him to the Garden District, which remained one of the city\u2019s most popular and picturesque areas. The houses, done in magnificent Victorian, Greek Revival, and Italianate styles, were beautiful, timeless. The Garden District had originally been the site of a plantation, but later it had been sold and subdivided into lots for wealthy Americans.</p><p>Leaving the Garden District behind, Tom\u00e1s thought briefly about the young man he had dined on earlier. He had left the body of his victim atop a stone angel in St. Louis Cemetery #1 where it was sure to be found. By morning, the citizens of New Orleans would be in a state of frenzy, as were the sheep in New York and Chicago and a few other cities where Tom\u00e1s had left evidence of his presence with the bodies he had left behind. The word \u201cvampire\u201d would travel the length of New Orleans before dawn.</p><p>Thanks to Anne Rice, New Orleans knew all about vampires, he thought with a grin. Some of the most popular tourist attractions were the vampire tours, including a stop at something called the Vampire Tavern. Tom\u00e1s had, in years past, appeared to one tour group or another. He had let them see him as he truly was, with his eyes glowing red and his fangs extended, and then vanished from their sight. It was always good for a laugh. Yes, it was entertaining to stir up the masses from time to time, though he had changed his mind about urging those of his clan to come out of hiding and prey openly upon the populace. It had been an idea born out of the dreariness of his life.</p><p>A full-scale war, once started, was difficult to curtail, even for one as old and powerful as he.</p><p>He thought of the body he had left behind in St. Louis Cemetery #1. The cemetery, located eight blocks from the Mississippi River on the north side of Basin Street, and one block from the inland border of the French Quarter, was the city\u2019s oldest and most famous burial ground.</p><p>Tom\u00e1s grinned ruefully. Only in New Orleans would graveyards be considered places of interest. Since the city itself was built on a swamp, the deceased were buried in above-ground tombs. The cemeteries had come to be known as \u201ccities of the dead\u201d due to the elaborate sculptures and decorative artwork that adorned the crypts and mausoleums. Many of the tombs were well maintained; some were surrounded by decorative wrought-iron fences, others were little more than piles of crumbling red brick. The tomb of the fictional vampire, Louis, from Interview With a Vampire had been located here. It was rumored that Anne Rice had purchased a tomb in #1 for her eventual use.</p><p>There were those who considered the cemetery to be located in a bad part of town, since it bordered the Iberville housing projects. On the plus side, the New Orleans Police Department was practically right next door. Still, wise tourists didn\u2019t visit the place alone, didn\u2019t stay after dark, and certainly didn\u2019t carry anything of value with them.</p> <p>Marie Laveau, the legendary \u201cvoodoo queen,\u201d was buried in the cemetery. Even now, long after her death, believers and nonbelievers came to visit her tomb, where they performed an act most thought odd. First, they left a gift\u2014either of food, money, or flowers\u2014for her spirit. After that, they turned around three times, and then inscribed an X on her tomb in hopes of receiving blessings in the future.</p><p>Tom\u00e1s had met Marie on several occasions. Both of them. Few people knew that when the first Marie Laveau retired, her daughter, who had also been named Marie, took over. Both had been tall, statuesque women, with curly black hair, flashing eyes, and reddish skin. Back in the 1800s, people of all colors and classes had sought Marie\u2019s help, whether with ordinary, everyday problems, or affairs of the heart.</p><p>Marie wasn\u2019t the only famous person buried in the cemetery. It also held the remains of Bernard de Marigny, a French-Creole playboy who had introduced the game of craps to the United States.</p><p>He paused on Bourbon Street to listen to a little Dixieland, his foot tapping to the music as he scanned the crowd. He wasn\u2019t looking for prey now, at least not the kind he dined on. His gaze came to rest on a raven-haired beauty with bright blue eyes and the kind of complexion that used to be described as peaches and cream.</p><p>When her gaze met his, he inclined his head. Unable to resist the compulsion in his eyes, she walked toward him, slim hips swaying. He assured her she had nothing to fear as he slipped his arm around her waist. Young men were for relieving one\u2019s hunger, and he took them quietly, quickly. But young women. Ah, how he loved the taste and smell of young females. Before killing them, he often made love to them, giving them pleasure before he thrust into them one last time, before he drank the last drop.</p><p>A thought took them to the Ferretti, which was moored in the harbor. He gave her a tour of the yacht, and she was suitably impressed, and then he took her into his bed, where he impressed her several times before the sun came up.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>Rhys stood hipshot against the end of the bar as he listened to the idle chatter of the well-dressed men and women around him. Outwardly, he seemed much the same as the other men. He wore the same expensive clothes, drove a flashy car, owned real estate in the city, including the building where he kept his primary lair. But inside, he was still the bastard son of a prostitute. The world changed. Kings and queens and presidents came and went. People were born, grew up, grew old, and passed on, but he remained always and forever the same, never quite able to shake off the feeling that he was inferior to those around him, never able to forget the scared little boy who had become a thief to survive.</p><p>He was still stealing, he mused somewhat bitterly, but instead of gold and silver and fancy baubles, he stole the life\u2019s blood of his victims.</p><p>He snorted softly. The humans in the room were no better than he was. He could hear their innermost thoughts\u2014the middle-aged man to his left had just embezzled three million dollars from his employer; the brunette at the other end of the bar was having an affair with her husband\u2019s brother; the well-dressed black man standing near the entrance was checking the crowd, looking for an easy mark. The balding man on his right had just lost his job and was contemplating suicide.</p><p>Straightening, Rhys closed his mind to those standing nearby. He had no interest in their mundane lives, didn\u2019t care a lick whether they solved their problems or not. What mattered was that it was almost midnight. Time to visit Shore\u2019s and the ever so lovely Megan DeLacey.</p><p>Megan paused in the act of hanging a new pair of slacks on the circular rack in the center of the store. Rhys was coming. She knew it by the sudden, rapid increase of her heartbeat, by the way her skin grew warm all over.</p><p>She was trying to figure out the how and the why of her reaction when he walked into the store.</p><p>Tall and blond and wearing clothes she had sold him, he looked like he had just stepped off the cover of GQ. She couldn\u2019t help wondering if he had spent as many minutes as she had deciding what to wear.</p><p>He smiled his hypnotic smile as he closed the distance between them. For a moment, she forgot where she was, forgot everything but the incredible attraction that flowed between them. What was there about him that left her feeling weak and shivery inside, that made her want to give him anything he desired? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMegan, how pretty you look this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs do you.\u201d</p><p>His dark eyes reflected his pleasure at her words.</p> <p>His nearness made her nervous on several levels. She folded her hands to keep from fidgeting. \u201cDid you come for the other half of your reward?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReward?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe new coat Mr. Parker offered you. To replace the ruined one, remember?\u201d She forced a smile. She hated being reminded of that dreadful night.</p><p>\u201cOh, that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that.\u201d He couldn\u2019t possibly have come to buy more clothes. He had already purchased enough shirts, pants, ties, and socks to keep three men clothed for a year. What would she do when he tired of coming into the shop? The nights would be unbearably dull when he no longer stopped by.</p> <p>Before he could reply, the front door opened and Drexel swept inside, followed by his entourage. The young rock star was dressed as flamboyantly as always, from his fluorescent green shirt to his mustard-colored slacks. He wore his long brown hair slicked back. A diamond stud sparkled in the lobe of one ear. His hazel eyes lit up when he saw Megan. Grinning, he swaggered toward her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what other stores he frequented when he was in town, but one thing was certain; he hadn\u2019t bought that garish outfit at Shore\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cHey, babe, what\u2019s shakin\u2019?\u201d His exuberance faded a bit when he noticed Rhys. \u201cWho\u2019s this guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrexel, this is Mr. Costain. He\u2019s a new client of mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, nice to meet ya, dude, but I\u2019m gonna need Megan for an hour or two. I\u2019ve got a happenin\u2019 gig tomorrow night, and I need to look smokin\u2019 hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have called in advance,\u201d Megan quietly reminded him.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a last minute thing. I just found out about it this morning, babe. I need something fresh, and I need it now.\u201d</p><p>Megan looked up at Rhys. \u201cDo you mind?\u201d</p><p>Rhys shrugged. Had Drexel been a grown man, he would have quickly put him in his place, but what the hell, he had all night, and the kid couldn\u2019t be more than eighteen or nineteen. \u201cGo ahead, I\u2019ll wait.\u201d</p><p>Megan smiled at Rhys as she led Drexel away.</p><p>Rhys grinned as he heard Drexel say, \u201cSo, babe, when are you gonna marry me?\u201d</p><p>As Megan helped Drexel put together an outfit guaranteed to get him noticed, she was ever aware that Rhys\u2019s gaze followed her every move. Drexel never stopped flirting with her, never stopped complimenting her. Once, when he used a line she recognized from a recent movie, she saw Rhys smile. Had he overheard what Drexel said? But that was impossible. Drexel had spoken to her in a whisper, and Rhys had been at the other end of the store.</p><p>Megan breathed a sigh of relief when, after a grueling two hours, Drexel finally rounded up his entourage and left the store. In those two hours, he had proposed three times and tried to kiss her twice. On his way out, he had given her two tickets to his upcoming concert and told her he would send a limo to pick her up. Megan would have refused the tickets, but it had been easier, and quicker, just to smile and accept. Besides, it might be fun.</p><p>Megan smiled at Rhys, surprised he had waited so long. \u201cHe\u2019s like a tornado, that one,\u201d she remarked.</p> <p>\u201cIf he lays a hand on you, he\u2019ll answer to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for goodness sake. He\u2019s just a kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s old enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe what I\u2019m hearing,\u201d Megan exclaimed. \u201cNot to mention the fact that it\u2019s none of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think not?\u201d</p><p>Megan glared at him, momentarily speechless. And then her temper kicked in. \u201cI don\u2019t have to answer to you, Mr. Costain, or to anyone else, for that matter. Just because we shared a glass of wine doesn\u2019t make you my keeper. Good night.\u201d</p><p>With a toss of her head, she pivoted on her heel and stalked into Mr. Parker\u2019s office, where she slammed the door so hard, the glass rattled.</p><p>Rhys stared after her, one brow raised in wry amusement. His kitten wasn\u2019t as tame as she appeared. But that was all right, he thought with a grin. He liked a woman with a little fire in her blood.</p><p>Mr. Parker looked up from the papers scattered across his desk when Megan stormed into his office. \u201cWhat\u2019d Drexel do now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Megan said quickly.</p><p>Mr. Parker regarded her quizzically for a moment, then shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m ready to lock up.\u201d He gathered the papers on his desk and dropped them into a drawer. \u201cYou ready to call it a night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s like a whirling dervish, that boy,\u201d Mr. Parker remarked, fishing his keys out of his pocket. \u201cBut he\u2019s sure good for our bottom line.\u201d</p><p>No doubt about that, Megan thought. Drexel had spent enough tonight to pay the rent on the building.</p><p>Stifling a yawn, she grabbed her handbag from the storeroom and followed Mr. Parker out the back door to the parking lot.</p><p>And found Rhys Costain waiting for her beside her car.</p><p>Startled, she pressed a hand to her heart. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we\u2019d go out for a drink so you could apologize for your little tantrum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>Rhys held up one hand. \u201cI\u2019m kidding about the apology, but not the drink. What do you say?\u201d</p><p>She studied him while she tried to make up her mind. Dressed all in black, he blended into the darkness. No. He was the darkness. She didn\u2019t know where that thought had come from, but it raised the hair on her arms. For all that he seemed to be a gentleman, she really didn\u2019t know anything about him other than his name and the fact that he owned a nightclub and had a great deal of money. He looked normal enough, and yet...</p><p>\u201cIt was an easy question,\u201d he remarked.</p><p>Quite the contrary. There was nothing easy about this man.</p><p>\u201cYes or no, Megan?\u201d</p><p>Her common sense said no, but her curious heart said, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>A slow smile spread across his face. In the darkness, his teeth looked very white. And sharp.</p><p>The better to eat you with, my dear.</p><p>Megan took a step backward. Had she heard those words in her head, or had Rhys spoken them aloud?</p><p>\u201cMy car, or yours?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d She bit down on her lower lip as she recalled Shirl\u2019s advice. Follow your instincts. And right now, her instincts were screaming for her to get in her car and drive away just as fast as she could. Which was odd, since she had felt completely safe when he\u2019d stayed with her the other night. Why was she so conflicted?</p><p>As though sensing her change of heart, Rhys took a step backward. \u201cAnother night, maybe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Wrenching open the car door, she slid behind the wheel and shoved the key in the ignition as he thoughtfully shut the door for her.</p><p>When she glanced into the rearview mirror, he was gone.</p><p>Megan blinked and looked again. How could he have vanished so quickly? She told herself he was still there, she just couldn\u2019t see him because he was dressed all in black. Like the night.</p><p>Because he was the night.</p><p>Suddenly chilled, she turned on the heater, hit the door locks, and drove out of the parking lot, tires squealing.</p><p>Shirl always left a lamp burning in the window for her, and tonight was no exception. Never before had that light looked so welcoming or been more appreciated.</p><p>There\u2019s nothing in the dark that isn\u2019t there in the light, her mother had always said. But tonight, in the dark with Rhys Costain, Megan might have argued with her.</p><p>Once inside, Megan double-locked the door, then laughed at her own foolishness. She was lucky she hadn\u2019t gotten a ticket for speeding on the way home. Standing in her own living room, with the door locked and the lights on, she wondered what she had been so afraid of.</p><p>After making sure Megan got safely home, Rhys went to his club to ponder whether he should continue to pursue the delectable Miss DeLacey. She was beautiful, and he wanted her more than he had ever wanted any woman, living or Undead. She was attracted to him, as well, but tonight she had shown that she possessed a strong sense of self-preservation. He couldn\u2019t remember the last time a woman had recognized the darkness within him and fled from his presence.</p><p>He raised the glass in his hand. \u201cHere\u2019s to you, Megan, my sweet. May you have a long and happy life.\u201d</p><p>Rhys didn\u2019t show up at Shore\u2019s the next night, or any night that week, or the next. On the one hand, Megan told herself she was relieved, and it was partly true. He frightened her on a level she didn\u2019t fully understand, nor could she put her finger on what it was about him that troubled her. On the other hand, he was the most fascinating man she had ever known. Not to mention the sexiest. His touch, his voice, his very presence, enflamed her senses. Had he hypnotized her? Drugged her?</p><p>Megan fretted over him on her two days off, two days that seemed even longer because Shirl had gone to San Francisco to visit her folks. Megan cleaned the house from top to bottom, did the laundry, washed the windows, and even waxed the kitchen floor, but all the mindless chores in the world couldn\u2019t keep her from thinking about Rhys, or wondering what he was doing, and whether he was thinking of her.</p><p>She arrived at Shore\u2019s half an hour early Tuesday night, eager to get out of the house and back to work.</p><p>Her ten o\u2019clock appointment arrived right on time. Shelby Brooks was a big-name Hollywood producer. In his midsixties, he had thick gray hair, blue eyes, and a no-non-sense attitude about shopping. He always brought a list, then sat in an empty dressing room, reading over a script, while she gathered the items he needed. He never tried anything on and rarely returned anything. She often wondered why he didn\u2019t just phone in his order and have his chauffeur pick it up.</p><p>Time and again, as she moved through the store, Megan found herself glancing at the front door. Even though Rhys rarely arrived before midnight, she kept hoping to see him striding toward her.</p><p>When she finished filling the order for Mr. Brooks, he thanked her profusely, handed her a small black velvet box, waved to Mr. Parker, and left the store. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s been a good night,\u201d Mr. Parker said, coming to stand beside her. \u201cWhat with Brooks and that agent who was here earlier...yes, a good night, indeed.\u201d He jerked his chin at the box. \u201cWhat did he bring you this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know yet.\u201d Mr. Brooks always brought her a gift\u2014a watch from Cartier, a silk scarf by Forzieri, a bracelet from Tiffany\u2019s.

Mr. Brooks had impeccable taste.</p><p>Mr. Parker glanced at his watch. \u201cWell, what do you say we close up early?\u201d</p><p>Megan couldn\u2019t stifle a wave of disappointment. It was only a little after eleven. If Rhys should decide to come by, she wouldn\u2019t be here. But she could hardly argue with the boss.</p><p>Pasting a smile on her face, she tucked the velvet box into her handbag, grabbed her coat, and followed Mr. Parker out the back door.</p><p>Her heartbeat accelerated when she saw a dark shadow by her car but, to her disappointment, there was no one there.</p> <p>Rhys watched Megan from the shadows. In spite of his good intentions, he couldn\u2019t stay away from her. Like a moth to a flame, he was drawn to her humanity, her warmth.</p><p>Would she destroy him if he flew too close?</p><p>After five hundred and twelve years of living alone, would he even care?</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>When Megan got home from work, she found Shirl stretched out on the sofa, a folded washcloth draped over her forehead.</p><p>\u201cAnother migraine?\u201d Megan asked, dropping her handbag and coat on a chair.</p> <p>Shirl nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been having them more often lately.

Shirl hated doctors and hospitals, probably because she had spent so much time in one during her father\u2019s illness last year. \u201cCan I get you anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call Frankenstein and see if he has a spare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are the flowers from?\u201d Megan asked, noticing the huge bouquet on the mantel.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. They\u2019re for you. They arrived a few minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor me?\u201d Tired as she was, Megan jumped to her feet. Who would be sending her flowers? And where on earth had whoever it was found a florist who delivered at this time of the night?</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the card say?\u201d Shirl asked. \u201cIt was all I could do to keep from reading it.\u201d</p><p>Megan opened the envelope and withdrew the small white card. \u201cIt says, \u2018I\u2019m sorry for being such a cad. Can we start over? RC.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s RC?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guy I told you about.\u201d</p><p>Sitting up, Shirl folded her arms under her breasts. \u201cYou mean the one who scares you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe very same.\u201d Megan ran her fingertips over the roses. There must have been three dozen flowers, each one a perfect, blood red bud.</p><p>\u201cI thought he hadn\u2019t been coming around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s a good thing, right? Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh, right.\u201d Megan plucked a bud from the vase, then sat down on the end of the sofa.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t sound convinced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently he misses you, too. I\u2019ll bet those roses cost a good three hundred dollars, not to mention an extra couple of bucks for that vase. It looks like real crystal. And I\u2019ll bet it cost him a pretty penny to get the florist to make a delivery this late, too. So, what is it about Mr. RC that scares you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething he did? Something he didn\u2019t do? Something he said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, nothing like that. I think I\u2019m just, I don\u2019t know, letting my imagination run away with me. How\u2019s your headache?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter,\u201d Shirl said with a yawn. \u201cI think I\u2019m gonna try to get a few hours\u2019 sleep. And as for that RC guy, maybe you ought to give him another chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you said to trust my instincts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, didn\u2019t I?\u201d Shirl yawned again. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Meggie,\u201d she said as she headed for the stairs. \u201cHe\u2019s young, rich, and thoughtful. Doesn\u2019t sound that bad to me. Maybe we can double date some time.\u201d</p><p>Megan shook her head. So much for Shirl\u2019s advice about following her instincts. She glanced at the roses on the mantel. Should she give Rhys another chance? Even if she didn\u2019t want to see him again, the least she could do was thank him for the flowers. She could look up his number at the store tomorrow.</p><p>She felt a bubble of excitement at the thought of hearing his voice again.</p><p>Smiling, she replaced the rose in the vase, then went up to bed. The sooner she went to sleep, the sooner tomorrow would come.</p><p>She dreamed of him that night, a strange dream unlike any she had ever had before. It was so vivid, so real, it didn\u2019t seem like a dream at all. She heard his voice in her mind, entreating her to let him in, and because it was what she wanted, she bid him come to her, and in an instant, he was there, inside her bedroom, kneeling on the foot of her bed, a strange reddish glow in his devil-dark eyes. When he held out his arms, she went to him gladly, only then realizing just how much she had missed him.</p><p>He cradled her to his chest as his hand stroked her hair. \u201cYou should tell me to go, now, before it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you just got here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no good for you.\u201d</p><p>She looked into his eyes; such deep, dark eyes. Hypnotic eyes.</p><p>\u201cMegan. I don\u2019t want to hurt you, but I can\u2019t stay away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFoolish girl.\u201d His hand stroked her neck, slid over her shoulder and down her arm. \u201cIf you only knew...\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnew what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho I am.\u201d His hand cupped her breast. \u201cWhat I am.\u201d</p><p>Her eyelids fluttered down as he caressed her. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d She moaned softly as he feathered kisses over her cheeks, the curve of her throat. His mouth was hot, so hot it sent waves of heat spiraling through her. Trembling with need, she clung to him.</p><p>He groaned deep in his throat. Drawing her down on the bed, he stretched out beside her, his arms holding her body close to his, their legs intimately entwined. He kissed her again and yet again, kissed her until she was aware of nothing but his touch, his voice. Her need.</p><p>He sobbed her name, his body tensing, and then she felt his teeth at her throat. There was a sharp pinprick of pain followed by a wave of intense sensual pleasure.</p><p>The pain startled her. You didn\u2019t feel pain in a dream.</p><p>Reaching for the bedside light, she switched it on, expecting to see Rhys lying beside her.</p><p>But no one was there.</p><p>Rhys cursed himself as he fled Megan\u2019s house. He hadn\u2019t gone there with the intention of drinking from her. He had only wanted to be near her again, to bask in the warmth of her presence. Damn! As for the flowers, he had sent them in a moment of weakness. Weakness! Damn her. What was there about Megan DeLacey that made him think of settling down? He swore a vile oath. He was a vampire, not some puny mortal. Even if he desired a wife and a family, which he didn\u2019t, that life was impossible for such as he. And yet Megan...ah, Megan with her sweet lips and her luscious body, she made him long for the kind of life that was forever denied him.</p><p>A thought took him to his club. Several of the regulars were sitting at the bar, sipping drinks. He grabbed the nearest female and took her to his private room. He was a single, white male, the Master of the West Coast Vampires, one of the most powerful creatures in the world. Why was he mooning over one mortal female?</p><p>The woman, Monique, smiled up at him when he closed the door, obviously pleased that he had chosen her.</p><p>When she started to speak, he held up his hand, silencing her. He didn\u2019t want conversation. Didn\u2019t want anything from her but relief from the twin talons of thirst and desire that he couldn\u2019t satisfy in Megan\u2019s arms.</p><p>Frightened and confused, Megan sat up in bed, the blankets tucked under her arms. What had just happened? Had it all been a dream? Of course, she thought, what else could it have been? And yet it had seemed so real. Her skin still tingled from the memory of his touch.</p><p>Rising, she padded into the bathroom and turned on the light, then stood in front of the mirror, turning her head from side to side. There! Were those bite marks on her neck?</p><p>She ran her fingers over the bites. They were definitely real. And strangely hot to the touch, as if she had a fever. Spider bites? Of course. She shook her head. Vampires, indeed!</p><p>After filling a paper cup with water, she took two aspirin and went back to bed. It was hours until dawn.</p><p>In the clear light of day, it was easy to convince herself it had been nothing but some weird dream. Besides, the proof was right in front of her eyes. Standing in front of the bathroom mirror, she ran her fingertips over her neck, relieved to find that the bite marks were gone.</p><p>After taking a quick shower, she went downstairs to fix something to eat. Shirl, of course, had already left for work and, as usual, she had left her dirty dishes in the sink, but that was all right. They had an agreement. Megan did the dishes, dusted, vacuumed, and did the shopping. Shirl did the laundry, watered the plants, and took out the trash. They took turns cooking dinner.</p><p>With several hours to kill, Megan slipped a DVD into the player, then curled up on the sofa, planning to lose herself in the movie Shirl had rented the night before.</p><p>She grimaced when she realized it wasn\u2019t the love story she had been expecting but a horror movie. She should have known. Shirl had a thing for vampires, werewolves, and other creepy things that went bump in the night. Megan had a feeling that, deep down, Shirl hoped vampires really existed.</p><p>In spite of herself, Megan soon found herself caught up in the story of a young vampire who was in love with a mortal woman. Of course, it ended badly, but then, how else could it end? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When the movie was over, she sat back with a shake of her head. It hadn\u2019t been a bad story, but what woman in her right mind would fall in love with a vampire, if such things actually existed, and let him drink her blood?</p><p>And even as the thought crossed her mind, she lifted a hand to her neck as the memory of the last night\u2019s dream rose, unbidden, in her mind. She knew it had only been a dream but now, with the memory of the movie she had just seen fresh in her mind, she couldn\u2019t help thinking how vampire-like her dream had been, with Rhys bending over her, his teeth grazing her throat....</p><p>\u201cStop that right now, Megan! It was just a dream, that\u2019s all. There\u2019s no such thing as vampires!\u201d</p> <p>After switching off the TV, she went into the kitchen. Shirl was doing a night shoot, so she wouldn\u2019t be home until late. Megan ate soup and a toasted cheese sandwich for dinner, then went into her bedroom to get ready for work.</p><p>Megan rang up her fifth sale of the evening. They had been busy all right, thank goodness. At home, she had done a fair job of keeping thoughts of Rhys Costain at bay, but the minute she had walked into Shore\u2019s, he was all she could think about. She had hoped to distract herself with work, but everything reminded her of Rhys.</p><p>She was straightening one of the shelves when a sudden ripple in the air sent a shiver down her spine. Lifting a hand to her neck, she went suddenly still. He was here. She knew it. Hardly daring to believe, she glanced over her shoulder. And he was there, as tall and handsome as she remembered. All her foolish imaginings and ridiculous fears took flight as he glided toward her. She couldn\u2019t take her eyes off of him. Everything about him appealed to her\u2014the red silk shirt that clung to his broad shoulders, the black slacks that emphasized his long legs, the dark blond of his hair. His eyes, so brown they were almost black.</p><p>\u201cMegan.\u201d As he murmured her name, he offered her a single blood-red rose.</p><p>She looked up at him. Every female on the planet knew a single red rose meant \u201cI love you.\u201d Had that been his intent, or was he just partial to red roses?</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>His gaze moved over her face. \u201cYour beauty puts it to shame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019ll forgive me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor acting like a jealous fool.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think we both acted like a couple of idiots,\u201d Megan allowed. \u201cLet\u2019s just forget it, shall we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like to go out for a drink after work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you then,\u201d he said, and taking her hand in his, he kissed her palm.</p><p>His lips were cool against her skin, yet they sent a shaft of heat straight to the core of her being.</p><p>\u201cTill then,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Too stunned to reply, Megan could only nod. Oh Lord, the effect that man had on her senses was almost hypnotic.</p><p>He was waiting by the back door when she got off work. \u201cWhere would you like to go?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She had been counting the hours until this moment, when she would see him again, hear his voice. Whatever magic he possessed, she was helpless to resist it. Nor did she want to. Their separation, though brief, had made her realize she never wanted to be without him again.</p><p>He walked her to his car, opened the passenger side door, then went around to the driver\u2019s side and slid behind the wheel. She had never known a man who moved with such innate power, or such effortless grace.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d she asked as he pulled out of the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cHow would you feel about going to my place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe club?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. My apartment.\u201d</p><p>Her common sense told her it probably wasn\u2019t a good idea to go to a man\u2019s apartment, alone, at two in the morning, but her curiosity about seeing where he lived kicked her common sense under the rug. Smiling, she said, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>In minutes, they were on the 101 Freeway heading toward Hollywood. Forty minutes later he pulled into the driveway of a tall, glass-fronted building.</p><p>\u201cYou live here?\u201d she asked, staring out the window.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cOn the top floor.\u201d</p><p>Her heart was racing a mile a minute when he pulled into a space marked PRIVATE in the underground garage.</p><p>After opening the car door, he took her by the hand. Her heels echoed loudly off the cement floor as he led her to an iron-barred door. He unlocked it and ushered her inside. Overhead lights came on when she crossed the threshold.</p><p>Giving her hand a squeeze, he led her down a wide corridor inlaid with black and white tiles to a bank of elevators. It was creepy, being in such a large building when everything was closed. Her heartbeat kicked up a notch when they stepped into the elevator. What was she doing here? No one even knew where she was.</p><p>When they reached the tenth floor, they took a private elevator up to the eleventh floor. Moments later, the elevator opened, revealing yet another door, this one made of what looked like solid steel.</p><p>Flashing a reassuring smile, Rhys unlocked the door and bowed her inside. Megan looked around in wonder as her feet sank in dark blue-gray carpet that must have been two inches deep. Twin sofas made of black leather faced each other in front of a white marble fireplace. Megan wasn\u2019t well versed in the art of the Old Masters, but she thought the painting over the fireplace might be a Botticelli.</p><p>As she turned in a slow circle, her gaze came to rest on a statue of a golden-haired Madonna. \u201cShe\u2019s lovely.\u201d Funny, Megan thought, it had never occurred to her that Rhys might be a religious man.</p><p>Rhys nodded. \u201cShe\u2019s very old.\u201d He ran a hand over the statue\u2019s shoulder. He had stolen her from a Catholic church soon after he had been turned. For a time, she had been his only companion.</p><p>Moving to a covered table located against the wall, Rhys lifted the cloth, revealing a bottle of vintage wine and an assortment of fruit, cheese, crackers, and chocolates. \u201cI thought you might be hungry.\u201d</p><p>He filled two glasses and handed her one.</p><p>\u201cWhat shall we drink to?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cTo forgetting the past,\u201d he murmured, and wished it were possible.</p><p>Smiling, Megan touched her glass to his. \u201cAnd starting over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStarting over,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>For a moment, it seemed as though his eyes glowed red, but then she realized it was probably just the reflection of the wine.</p><p>It was while she was filling her plate that she noticed there was only service for one. \u201cAren\u2019t you having anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not much for fruit and cheese.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr chocolate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr chocolate. But I thought you might like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat woman doesn\u2019t like chocolate?\u201d She glanced at the sweets. Light, milk, and dark chocolates of every variety filled a large crystal bowl. \u201cYou don\u2019t expect me to eat all of that, do you?\u201d she asked, although she didn\u2019t think it would be much of a hardship.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what kind you liked, so I got a little of everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood choice,\u201d she said, grinning. \u201cSince I like a little of everything.\u201d She picked up a dark chocolate truffle. Nirvana, she thought as it melted in her mouth. \u201cWhat do you like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like you,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cFar more than I should. Far more than is good for you.\u201d</p><p>Megan stared at him, suddenly reminded that she knew almost nothing about this man. That they were alone in an empty building. That no one would hear her if she screamed for help. An innate sense of self-preservation had her taking a step backward, even though there was no place to go.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to frighten you.\u201d</p><p>She searched her mind for some flip reply to ease the tension that stretched between them, but nothing came to mind. Why was she suddenly so afraid?</p><p>\u201cMegan.\u201d Putting his glass aside, he ran a hand through his hair. He had known bringing her to his lair had been a bad idea from the start. Having her here, so close, was proving to be even more of a temptation than he had expected. If only her eyes weren\u2019t as soft and brown as sun-warmed earth, her skin so incredibly smooth, her lips so pink and inviting. If only her blood didn\u2019t sing to him. \u201cI should take you home.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, but she made no move toward the door, and neither did he.</p><p>Muttering an oath, he took a step toward her. She was here, and he wanted her.</p><p>The next move was hers. Only she didn\u2019t move.</p><p>As though frozen in place, Megan stared up at him.</p><p>With a sigh, he closed the distance between them, took the plate from her hand, and set it on the table.</p><p>Megan\u2019s heartbeat shifted into overdrive when he reached for her. Like a rabbit hypnotized by a hawk, she could only stand there, waiting, wondering what would happen next. Would he carry her into his bedroom and ravish her? Would she care?</p><p>Rhys inhaled deeply as he took her in his arms. The scent of her blood, her fear, enticed him. He fought the urge to taste her; instead, he lowered his head and claimed her lips with his.</p><p>The sweet warmth of her lips was more intoxicating than the wine that lingered on her tongue. She pleased him in every way. Her scent enflamed his hunger, her lush curves aroused his lust.</p><p>She moaned softly, and Rhys drew back, not certain if her muffled cry was a whimper of pleasure or a plea for him to stop.</p><p>\u201cMegan.\u201d Hoping for enlightenment, his mind brushed hers as he murmured her name. As he had feared, her thoughts were indecisive. Her body wanted him; her mind was advising caution; her instincts were screaming for her to back away before it was too late.</p><p>She looked up at him, her gaze confused, her lips slightly parted.</p><p>Rhys swore softly. He could easily bend her will to his, but he didn\u2019t want to take her by force, didn\u2019t want to take her to his bed until it was her own idea. Blowing out a sigh of frustration, he lightly stroked her back.</p><p>\u201cRelax. We won\u2019t do anything you don\u2019t want to do.\u201d Taking her by the hand, he led her to one of the sofas and urged her to sit down, then he went back to the table for her plate, hoping that doing something as ordinary as eating would calm her nerves. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPlease, eat,\u201d he said as he offered her the plate.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She was relieved that her hands barely shook at all as she licked the rich, dark chocolate off a plump red strawberry.</p><p>While Rhys sat at the other end of the sofa, thinking how lucky that strawberry was.</p> <p>Chapter 9</p><p>It was early morning when Rhys drove her home. It wasn\u2019t until they were standing outside her door that Megan realized her car was still at Shore\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cWhat time should I pick you up for work tomorrow night?\u201d Rhys asked. \u201cSeven thirty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be great. You must have been reading my mind,\u201d Megan said with a smile. \u201cSince I forgot all about my car.\u201d</p><p>He winked at her. \u201cI\u2019ll see you then.\u201d</p> <p>She nodded, a flurry of anticipation rising in her stomach as she waited for him to kiss her good night.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have to wait long.</p><p>\u201cMegan?\u201d</p><p>She looked up, her gaze meeting his, felt herself falling into the depths of his deep brown eyes as he drew her into his embrace. His lips were cool against her skin as he lightly kissed her brow, her cheeks, the curve of her throat. She moaned softly as his teeth grazed her neck, only for a moment, and then his mouth covered hers and he kissed her again. Kissed her until she was dizzy with the heat of it.</p><p>Moments later\u2014or was it longer?\u2014she was standing in the doorway watching him drive away.</p><p>Megan frowned. Had she missed something? She didn\u2019t remember going into the house, or telling him good night.</p> <p>Lifting a hand to her neck, she went inside and closed the door, wondering how she could still be hungry after all the fruit and cheese\u2014and chocolate\u2014she had eaten earlier.</p><p>She wobbled a little as she went into the kitchen. Had she had too much to drink? Was that why she felt so woozy?</p><p>Shaking her head, she filled a glass with orange juice. Maybe she was drunk, she thought with a faint grin. Oh, yeah. Drunk on Rhys Costain\u2019s kisses.</p><p>\u201cI have tickets to Drexel\u2019s concert this coming Saturday night,\u201d Megan said. \u201cWould you like to go? I already asked Mr. Parker for the night off.\u201d</p><p>Rhys had driven her to work earlier and was now in the process of trying on three-quarter-length Armani coats to replace the one that had been ruined in the attempted robbery.</p><p>\u201cDrexel? Is he the kid that was in here the other night? The one who wants to marry you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s him. By the way, Mr. Parker\u2019s been telling all of our customers what a hero you are. One of them is a reporter for the Times. He\u2019d like to interview you for a human interest story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want your fifteen minutes of fame?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even five minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost people these days will do almost anything to get their names or pictures in the news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue enough,\u201d he agreed. \u201cBut I\u2019m not like most people.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t argue with that. Lifting her hand, she smoothed the collar of his coat. \u201cThis one fits like it was made for you. Check it out in the mirror.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need.\u201d He smiled at her. \u201cI can see myself in your eyes.\u201d</p><p>It occurred to her that, in all the times he had been in the shop, she had never once seen him look in a mirror.</p><p>Shrugging out of the coat, he handed it to her. \u201cDo you want to meet me when you get off work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d Megan yawned behind her hand. \u201cAll these late nights are starting to catch up with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I could come over before you go to work tomorrow night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Shirl\u2019s dying to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShirl? She\u2019s your roommate?\u201d</p><p>Megan nodded. \u201cShe\u2019s been seeing a cop pretty regularly and suggested the four of us go out for dinner and a movie sometime, if you want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Rhys said agreeably, although dinner might present a problem. But he\u2019d worry about that later.</p><p>\u201cI told her about your nightclub. She said she\u2019d like to see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I recall, you mentioned she was into the Goth scene at one time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Do you want to try on anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll take this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, just let me wrap it up.\u201d</p><p>He followed her to the counter, content to stand there, watching her, as she slipped one of Shore\u2019s distinctive vinyl garment bags over the Armani.</p><p>\u201cWhat time tomorrow night?\u201d he asked, taking the coat from her hand.</p><p>\u201cWell, I have to be at work at eight. How about five? It\u2019s my night to fix dinner.\u201d</p><p>The hour wasn\u2019t a problem. He could endure the sunlight for brief periods of time. But the food. Short of planting the thought in her head that he was eating, there was no way to get around it, so he said, \u201cGo ahead and eat without me. I\u2019ve got a meeting with some associates in the evening. I\u2019ll try to be at your place around six thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can always eat later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019ll grab something on my way over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Too bad about dinner, though. I\u2019m a pretty good cook when I want to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you are,\u201d he said, kissing her on the cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>Megan nodded. \u201cAssociates,\u201d she murmured as she watched him leave the store. What kind of associates? Business? Or pleasure?</p><p>Adrianna brushed a lock of hair from her brow as she settled onto the sofa. \u201cSo, we\u2019re all here,\u201d she said impatiently. \u201cNow what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have something better to do?\u201d Rhys asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, as a matter of fact. I haven\u2019t fed yet, and I\u2019m hungry. Why are we meeting so early?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ve got a date,\u201d Rhys said, which got everyone\u2019s attention. \u201cThat rogue vamp has left New Orleans and seems to be heading our way. There have been several killings reported in Houston. Bodies all drained of blood. No clues left behind. Have any of you heard anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust what\u2019s been on the news,\u201d Nicholas said, shrugging. \u201cI still don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything for us to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless he comes here, you idiot,\u201d Seth Adams said. \u201cOne rogue vamp is all it takes to stir up the sheep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he comes here, it\u2019ll be Costain\u2019s problem,\u201d Adrianna said, looking bored as she examined her fingernails. \u201cAfter all, he\u2019s the Master of the West Coast Vampires.\u201d</p><p>Rhys turned his gaze on Adrianna. \u201cIf it comes to a fight, I\u2019m sure we\u2019re all hoping I\u2019ll win,\u201d he said, his voice harsh.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Adrianna replied smoothly. \u201cBesides, there\u2019s nothing for you to worry about. After all, there aren\u2019t many vampires around who are older than you.\u201d</p><p>Rhys grunted thoughtfully. He could count those older than himself on one hand\u2014first and easily the most dangerous was Tom\u00e1s Villagrande, the oldest vampire in existence. Tom\u00e1s ruled the East Coast. After Tom\u00e1s came Gregor McCarthy, an eight-hundred-year-old vampire who laid claim to both England and Ireland. Next came Baiba. Tall and svelte and seven centuries old, she made her home in Russia. Lastly, there was six-hundred-year-old Sandoval, who kept his primary lair in Madrid.</p><p>The ancient ones might defeat him, but Rhys had no fear of any of the other vampires who might come against him. He knew most of those who resided in the United States who might pose a threat. Volger ruled the states in the Midwest; a cocky vampire known as Tristan claimed the North; the South belonged to Morag, one of the oldest female vampires in existence, though not so old as Baiba.</p><p>Rhys dismissed the Council with a wave of his hand, and then he smiled. It had been a long time since he\u2019d fought another vampire to the death. He discounted the fight with Mariah. That hadn\u2019t been a battle so much as an execution.</p><p>But tonight, he had a date with Megan DeLacey.</p><p>A knock at the door had Megan\u2019s heart racing like a runaway train. He was here.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, girlfriend?\u201d Shirl called as Megan went to answer the door. \u201cYou\u2019re looking a little frazzled.\u201d</p><p>Frazzled didn\u2019t begin to cover it, Megan thought. Just thinking about Rhys sent her hormones into overdrive.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Shirl said, a smile in her voice. \u201cAs soon as I get a look at him, I\u2019ll make myself scarce.\u201d</p><p>Megan nodded. She paused to take a deep breath before she opened the door. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>Lord, the man was gorgeous. Tonight, he wore a gray-and-black\u2013striped shirt with the sleeves rolled up over a black T-shirt, black jeans, and boots. When he smiled at her, she thought she might melt.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d He arched one brow at her. \u201cYou gonna invite me in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh, yes.\u201d She took a step back, thinking how good he smelled as he moved past her into the living room where Shirl waited.</p><p>Megan quickly introduced Rhys to her roommate, and then, true to her word, Shirl excused herself and went upstairs, but not before giving Megan a wide-eyed nod of approval.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Megan said, gesturing for Rhys to sit down, \u201cwhat did you do today?\u201d</p><p>He lifted one shoulder in a graceful shrug. \u201cNothing much. Worked on the books. Ordered some new stock for the bar, that kind of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. How did your business meeting go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout as I expected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you owned the nightclub very long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few years. It keeps me busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what do you think of Shirl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a knockout.\u201d</p><p>It was the response Megan had expected, but she couldn\u2019t help feeling a little jealous just the same. Men rarely paid any attention to her when she and Shirley were in the same room.</p><p>\u201cBut not as pretty as you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice of you to say, but it isn\u2019t necessary. Or true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. And to me, you\u2019re beautiful.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She felt her cheeks warm at the compliment. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay if I kiss you?\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly. \u201cYou\u2019ve never asked before, but, yes, it\u2019s okay.\u201d</p> <p>She closed her eyes as his arm slid around her shoulders, drawing her closer. His lips were cool, yet, at their touch, heat flowed through her, turning her blood to liquid fire. She had been kissed by other men, but never with such intensity. If kissing were an art form, he would surely be the master, she thought dreamily. The Michelangelo of osculatory delights. The Picasso of kissers.</p><p>Somehow, they were lying on the sofa, with Rhys\u2019s body covering hers, his mouth trailing fire as he rained kisses on her forehead, the tip of her nose, her eyelids, and her cheeks before returning to her lips. She moaned softly, every nerve and cell in her body straining toward him. It had been years since her divorce, years since she had taken a man to her bed. Or wanted to.</p><p>She felt bereft when he took his mouth from hers and gained his feet.</p><p>A rush of heat flooded her cheeks when she looked past Rhys and saw Shirl standing in the doorway, a smirk on her face. \u201cI hate to interrupt you, but Mr. Parker just called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did?\u201d Sitting up, Megan smoothed a hand over her hair. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear the phone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not surprised. Anyway, he said he\u2019s going to be late tonight and wants to know if you can go in a little early and open up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he still on the phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He said to call back if you can\u2019t make it.\u201d</p><p>Megan glanced at her watch. It was seven fifteen. \u201cI guess I\u2019d better get ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry for the intrusion,\u201d Shirl said, looking at Rhys. \u201cIt was nice to meet you, Mr. Costain.\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her as he raked a hand through his hair. \u201cJust Rhys.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRhys it is,\u201d she said, returning his grin. \u201cSee you tomorrow, Meggie. Good night, Rhys.\u201d</p><p>He waited until Shirl left the room before taking Megan by the hand and pulling her to her feet. \u201cMeggie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate that name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to drive you to work?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t necessary.\u201d</p><p>He was about to say he would be glad to do it when his cell phone rang. \u201cExcuse me.\u201d Turning his back to Megan, he flipped open the phone. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019ve been three more murders,\u201d Rupert said. \u201cBodies all drained of blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFort Worth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for letting me know,\u201d Rhys said, and ended the call.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d Megan asked.</p><p>\u201cSome business at the club I need to take care of,\u201d he replied. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>A quick kiss, and he was gone.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a hottie, that one,\u201d Shirl said, coming up behind her.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh, yes, he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe sure left in a hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome business at his club. I\u2019ll have to take you there some time. You\u2019ll love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gorgeous, but I can see why he scares you. There\u2019s an edge about him, something...I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sensed it, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could anyone miss it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought maybe it was just me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother thing, he seems really, I don\u2019t know, really worldly wise and self-assured for someone so young. You know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>Megan nodded. She had noticed that, too. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t act his age, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful, girlfriend,\u201d Shirl admonished. \u201cI think this one plays for keeps.\u201d</p><p>Rhys swore softly as he drove to the club. He didn\u2019t want to have to worry about some rogue vamp, or what it might mean if the renegade decided to come to LA. As Master of the West Coast Vampires, Rhys had only one rule for those in his territory\u2014don\u2019t leave any bodies drained of blood where they could be found. Most vampires were smart enough not to call attention to their kind. They preyed on transients or the homeless\u2014people who wouldn\u2019t be missed. But this rogue, he was killing indiscriminately, and that boded ill for all of them.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>Tom\u00e1s strolled through the Log Cabin Village located in a woodsy section of Trinity Park in Fort Worth. Seven fully restored cabins occupied the settlement. All had been built sometime in the 1850s. During the day, volunteers gave visitors a taste of what life had been like in days gone by, demonstrating things like grinding corn, spinning, weaving, and the art of making candles. The botanical gardens were another of his favorite sites. The gardens featured over two thousand acres of trails and garden exhibits in what was one of the oldest and largest natural settings in North Texas. In addition, there was a large conservatory filled with tropical plants and exotic birds.</p><p>Another place he visited whenever he was in town was the Kimball Art Museum. At one time or another, the museum had showcased the work of such noted artists as Rubens, Picasso, Renoir, and Rembrandt, as well as the works of contemporary artists from around the world.</p><p>One of the advantages of being a vampire was that he didn\u2019t have to endure the crowds of tourists who descended on Trinity Park or roamed through the museum during the day. Visiting the museum late at night, he could study his favorite paintings without being bothered by impudent teens or noisy toddlers.</p><p>Leaving the museum, he moved swiftly to Sundance Square. Located in the heart of downtown, the square gave him the feeling of walking the streets at the turn of the century, with its renovated storefronts and red brick streets. He had walked here when the city was new, when the streets were dirt and the stink of cowboys, horses, and cattle filled the air. But now his nostrils filled with a different scent.</p><p>The scent of prey.</p><p>He found them parked in a car on a side street, the windows covered with steam. Young lovers, he thought, as he wrenched the driver\u2019s side door open. He broke the boy\u2019s neck with a quick twist and had the girl in his arms and out of the car before she realized what was happening.</p><p>His hand stifled her cries as he carried her away from the car, away from the city, to a place where her screams wouldn\u2019t be heard, and then he let her scream to her heart\u2019s content as he buried his fangs in her neck. She fought him as best she could, but her fists were puny weapons; he hardly noticed them striking his back as her warm red blood trickled down his throat.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>On the night of the concert, Rhys arrived at Megan\u2019s house a few minutes after eight. He looked drop-dead gorgeous, as always. Clad all in black and wearing a pair of trendy dark glasses, he could easily have passed for a rock star himself.</p><p>There was a line around the building when they arrived at the venue, but Megan had a pass so she and Rhys didn\u2019t have to wait. There were hoots and hollers of protest when they bypassed the crowd and ducked through a side door reserved for VIPs.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been to a rock concert?\u201d Megan asked as they took their seats in a roped-off section in the front of the hall.</p><p>\u201cOne or two,\u201d Rhys answered. In his time, he had seen them all. He had to admit, being in close quarters with thousands of screaming fans wasn\u2019t his favorite way to spend an evening. It wasn\u2019t easy to keep his hunger under control when every indrawn breath carried the scent of blood, when his ears were assaulted by the sound of so many beating hearts. If not for the lovely woman beside him, he wouldn\u2019t be here now. He supposed it was a sign of how smitten he was with Megan DeLacey that he had agreed to come to the concert at all.</p><p>Excitement flooded the stadium and screams bounced off the walls when Drexel appeared. He wore a pair of black spandex pants, a white shirt reminiscent of the kind pirates had once worn, and knee-high black boots.</p><p>Colored lights flashed as he swaggered to center stage. He looked out over the crowd and then, as if reaching for a woman, his hand curled around the microphone, and he began to sing.</p><p>Rhys shook his head. He doubted if anyone could actually hear Drexel\u2019s voice over the earsplitting music and the near-hysterical screams of thousands of crazed female fans. White vapor rose from the stage floor and curled around Drexel\u2019s ankles. Cameras flashed. Girls fainted. Yellow-shirted security guards prowled the front of the stage and the edges of the crowd, leaping into action now and again to prevent overeager fans from jumping up on the stage.</p><p>Rhys glanced at Megan when she tugged on his arm. \u201cWhat do you think of him?\u201d she asked, shouting to be heard over the roar of the crowd.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s good.\u201d The kid might be young, but he knew how to play to the audience. They had fallen under his spell the minute he walked out on the stage, and he never let them go. Rhys had to admire that.</p><p>The band had been playing for about an hour when Rhys detected the acrid scent of smoke. Lifting his head, he sniffed the air. The smell was coming from backstage, and getting thicker and stronger by the minute.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said, grabbing Megan by the hand. \u201cWe\u2019re getting out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo time to talk about it now.\u201d He slid his hand up until he had a firm grip on her forearm.</p><p>\u201cRhys!\u201d She twisted, trying to break his hold. \u201cI\u2019m not ready to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are.\u201d He pulled her along behind him until they reached the aisle.</p><p>A security guard stepped out in front of Rhys. He glanced at Megan, who was still trying to wriggle free of Rhys\u2019s grasp. \u201cSomething wrong here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a fire,\u201d Rhys said curtly. \u201cBackstage. You\u2019d better get these people out of here before it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>The guard\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cFire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you smell it?\u201d Rhys glanced back at Megan. She had stopped fighting him, her gaze riveted on the stage where long, yellow tongues of flame were eating their way up the backdrop.</p><p>Drexel and the band seemed unaware of what was going on until shouts of \u201cfire!\u201d grew so loud, they drowned out the band. The music came to an abrupt halt when Drexel glanced behind him. The drummer jumped to his feet when the backdrop dissolved in a shower of rainbow sparks. Without the barrier, the acrid stink of burning wood and fabric grew stronger, heavier. Panic erupted on the stage and spread through the audience as thousands of people blindly fought their way through the smoke toward the exits, tripping over each other in their haste. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Muttering an oath, Rhys swept Megan into his arms and transported the two of them out of the building to the sidewalk across the street.</p><p>Megan stared up at him, her eyes wide. \u201cWhat happened? How did you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGet us out of there so fast. I don\u2019t even remember leaving the building.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s understandable. You were afraid. The mind can play funny tricks on you when you\u2019re scared.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, she shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d One minute they had been inside; the next, they were here. She had no memory of what had happened in between.</p><p>Rhys set Megan on her feet, then folded his hands over her shoulders. Gazing deeply into her eyes, he spoke to her, his voice low and hypnotic. \u201cI carried you through the crowd and out of the building. We were lucky to escape so quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she murmured. \u201cLucky.\u201d</p> <p>When he was certain she believed what he wanted her to believe, he released his hold on her mind and turned his attention to the people still running out of the building, which was now engulfed in flames. The screams of those trapped inside, the sobs of those who had escaped, the sickly sweet smell of burning flesh rode the night air. And over all, the wail of sirens as fire trucks, police cars, and ambulances rolled to the scene.</p><p>Freed of his spell, Megan blinked up at Rhys. \u201cDrexel? Do you think he\u2019s...?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t say the word, couldn\u2019t bear to think of the enthusiastic young man who had proposed to her so many times being burned alive in the inferno.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Rhys stared at the fire. It was like a scene out of hell, with the flames shooting skyward and sparks falling in the streets and landing on the crowd. Men and women, some with their clothing on fire, ran out of the building, trampling each other in their panic. Rhys shook his head. There wasn\u2019t much in his existence he feared, but fire...It was one of the few things that could destroy him.</p><p>Megan watched in morbid fascination as the firemen went to work. A few of them dashed into the burning building while others manned the fire hoses. The air crackled as thick streams of cold water met the hot, hungry flames.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t long until the reporters arrived, shoving their microphones in the faces of spectators, asking people who had just survived a horrible ordeal the same stupid questions reporters always asked at scenes of death and destruction.</p> <p>Rhys glanced at Megan. \u201cAre you ready to go?\u201d</p><p>Megan shook her head. She couldn\u2019t leave, not until she knew whether or not Drexel had survived. And then she saw him, sitting on the curb across the way. His pants were singed, his face and hands were smeared with soot, his right arm looked badly burned. But he was alive.</p><p>The reporters saw him, too. Like vultures on a fresh kill, they swarmed around him, all asking questions at once.</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t they just leave him alone?\u201d Megan exclaimed. \u201cCan\u2019t they see he\u2019s hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to get rid of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you?\u201d she asked hopefully.</p><p>\u201cWatch me.\u201d Flexing his shoulders, Rhys pushed his way through the crowd of reporters. \u201cDrexel, do you want to talk to these clowns?\u201d</p><p>Drexel shook his head, then started coughing.</p> <p>Standing in front of the boy, Rhys fixed his gaze on each reporter in turn. \u201cYou heard him, ladies and gentlemen, he wants to be left alone. Now get the hell out of here.\u201d</p><p>As though pulled by the same string, the reporters all turned and walked away.</p><p>\u201cCome on, kid,\u201d Rhys said, \u201clet\u2019s get you out of here.\u201d And so saying, he swung the young man into his arms and carried him toward an ambulance that had just arrived at the end of the block.</p><p>When one of the attendants started to protest that there were others more in need of immediate care, Rhys forced his will on the EMT, then opened the ambulance doors, jumped inside, and lowered Drexel onto the bench that ran along one side of the vehicle.</p><p>The EMT came in behind Rhys and began examining the burn on Drexel\u2019s right arm.</p><p>Drexel stared up at Rhys. \u201cYou,\u201d he said, his voice gruff from all the smoke he had inhaled. \u201cI know you....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe met at Shore\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYoung man,\u201d the EMT admonished, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t try to talk right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe medic\u2019s right,\u201d Rhys said. \u201cSave your breath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMegan...I saw her....\u201d Drexel broke into a paroxysm of coughing. \u201cIs she...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine. You\u2019ll be proposing to her again in no time.\u201d</p><p>Drexel smiled faintly; then, with a pain-filled sigh, he closed his eyes.</p><p>Rhys stared down at the kid for a moment. Had he ever been that young? With a shake of his head, he jumped out of the ambulance and returned to Megan.</p><p>\u201cIs he all right?\u201d she asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be fine. He\u2019s got a bad burn on one arm, and he inhaled some smoke. Nothing too serious.\u201d</p><p>Rhys glanced at the six covered bodies lying in the street. He could have told the firemen there were two more inside, but the dead were beyond help, beyond caring.</p><p>The fire was under control now. Cops were directing traffic away from the scene. The scream of sirens pierced the night as ambulances pulled away from the stadium. Reporters, their cameramen in tow, prowled the edges of the crowd like wolves on the scent of prey, hoping to chase down a good story.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Rhys said, \u201clet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t argue this time.</p><p>Wrapping his arm around her shoulders, Rhys led her to his car, helped her inside, fastened her seat belt.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shook her head. She didn\u2019t want to talk about what had happened, didn\u2019t want to think about it, but she couldn\u2019t get the images out of her mind\u2014the relentless flames, the firemen rushing into the inferno, putting their own lives at risk to try to save others. It was frightening, the way the fire had spread so quickly. She thought of all the people who had gone to the concert looking to have a good time and had lost their lives. Images of the covered bodies lying in the street flashed through her mind. If not for Rhys\u2019s quick thinking, one of those bodies could have been hers. It was the first time she had ever seriously considered her own mortality. She was young and healthy. Dying was something that happened to other people.</p><p>Rhys slid a glance at Megan. She was trembling now. After removing his jacket, Rhys tucked it around her. He needed to get her home, warm her up with some hot tea, and put her to bed before she collapsed.</p><p>He had no sooner pulled up in front of Megan\u2019s place when Shirl came running out the front door, her bathrobe flying behind her. She yanked open the car door, then dropped to her knees. \u201cMegan! Are you all right? I saw the fire on the news. I was so worried!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, just a little shaky.\u201d Clutching Rhys\u2019s jacket closer, she got out of the car. Rhys was instantly at her side, his arm sliding around her waist to steady her.</p><p>Shirl glanced up at him and realized there had been nothing to worry about. On some innate level, she knew this man would never let anything happen to Megan.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you make us some tea?\u201d Rhys suggested. \u201cAnd add a little brandy to Megan\u2019s, if you\u2019ve got it.\u201d</p><p>With a nod, Shirl hurried back into the house.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Megan said, seeing his worried expression. \u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Swinging her into his arms, he carried her inside. He knew it wasn\u2019t necessary. She could have walked, but he needed to hold her. He knew even better than she did how quickly a life could be snuffed out. He had been responsible for dispatching a few himself.</p><p>In the living room, he lowered her to the sofa. Taking his coat from her, he slipped it on, then covered her with the afghan folded over the back of the couch. Sitting beside her, he took her hands in his. \u201cYou\u2019re cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He needed to feed, something he had been doing more of since meeting Megan. It was the only way to keep his skin from feeling abnormally cool.</p><p>\u201cHere we go.\u201d Shirl glanced at Rhys as she placed a tray on the coffee table. \u201cI brought sugar, milk, and honey, since I don\u2019t know how you like your tea.\u201d</p><p>He grinned up at her. \u201cI don\u2019t like tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Can I get you anything else?\u201d</p><p>His gaze moved to the pulse throbbing in her throat, and then he shook his head. \u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him a moment; then, with a shrug, she picked up the teapot and filled two cups. She added a spoonful of honey to one of them, and handed the other to Megan.</p><p>\u201cDid they say anything on the news about how the fire started?\u201d Rhys asked.</p><p>\u201cSomething about the wiring backstage. I don\u2019t know what that backdrop was made of, but it went up like flash paper. The band was lucky to make it off the stage. I saw Drexel on the news. They said he\u2019s going to be all right.\u201d Shirl grinned at Rhys. \u201cThey interviewed one of the EMTs. He said some really intense guy insisted he take care of Drexel right away, even though he wasn\u2019t that badly hurt. I\u2019m guessing that was you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be right,\u201d Rhys said, chuckling.</p><p>\u201cI thought so. I\u2019m just glad you\u2019re both all right.\u201d Shirl glanced at Megan, who was yawning. \u201cI think it\u2019s time I put you to bed.\u201d</p><p>Megan nodded. The tea, heavily laced with brandy, must have been doing its work. She was suddenly very sleepy.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Rhys said, gaining his feet, \u201cI\u2019ll carry you upstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can walk,\u201d Megan said, smothering another yawn.</p><p>\u201cI know you can,\u201d he agreed, lifting her into his arms, \u201cbut why should you?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t think of a single reason. Instead, she rested her head against his shoulder and closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cLook at that,\u201d Shirl said. \u201cShe\u2019s asleep already.\u201d</p><p>Rhys brushed a lock of hair from Megan\u2019s cheek, then bent his head to kiss her brow. Thanks to his preternatural power, she would sleep through what was left of the night and wake up feeling glad to be alive. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He looked up to find Shirl watching him, an inquisitive expression on her face. \u201cSomething wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>He lifted one brow. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d It was an inane question. He knew exactly what she meant.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s something about you. Something...\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t put my finger on it, but there\u2019s something not quite right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take Megan up to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to tell me who you are, or what you are, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. All you need to know is that I\u2019m in love with Megan, and I would never hurt her.\u201d</p><p>Shirl nodded. She didn\u2019t know much about this man, but she could see the truth of his words in his eyes.</p> <p>She led the way up to Megan\u2019s room and turned down the covers on the bed. After Rhys lowered Megan onto the mattress, Shirl shooed him out of the room and shut the door. She undressed Megan, eased a nightgown over her head, then pulled the covers over her before allowing Rhys back into the room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait for you downstairs,\u201d Shirl said, and left the room.</p><p>Rhys sat on the edge of the bed, one hand lightly stroking Megan\u2019s cheek. She might have perished in the fire if he hadn\u2019t been there tonight. The thought cut like a knife. Even though she wasn\u2019t hurt, he was hesitant to leave her, but Shirl was waiting downstairs to lock up after him. It was the only thing keeping him from leaving by the window. Using his supernatural powers would only add to her suspicions. Rising, he kissed Megan\u2019s cheek before going downstairs.</p><p>He found Shirl by the front door.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Mr. Costain.\u201d</p><p>Stifling a grin, he murmured, \u201cGood night, Miss Mansfield,\u201d and left the house.</p> <p>She stared after him. Megan had been right to be wary of Rhys Costain, Shirl decided as she turned off the lights in the living room. He was remarkably handsome. He was polite. He dressed well and drove a great car, but...She shook her head. Something about him definitely wasn\u2019t right.</p><p>\u201cMr. Costain,\u201d she murmured. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>Feeling a sudden chill, she closed and locked the door. Maybe that double-date she and Megan had talked about wasn\u2019t such a good idea, after all.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>In the morning, Megan woke feeling wonderful. Smiling, she sat up and stretched her arms over her head. It was a beautiful day.</p><p>Rising, she took a long, hot shower, washed her hair, brushed her teeth, wrapped up in her favorite fluffy robe, and went downstairs to get the Sunday paper.</p><p>Humming softly, she fixed a cup of hot chocolate, then sat down and spread the paper on the kitchen table.</p><p>She frowned when she read the headlines:</p> <p>INFERNO AT DOWNTOWN ROCK CONCERT</p><p>EIGHT DEAD, TWO HUNDRED INJURED</p><p>How could she have forgotten about the fire? She quickly read the article, which gave a brief review of the concert, then went on to say that the cause of the fire was still under investigation, although the preliminary report pointed to defective wiring and faulty smoke detectors.</p><p>Reading the paper brought all the unbelievable horror of the evening rushing back\u2014the terror that had engulfed her, the almost hypnotic glow of the flames as they licked at the building, the bodies of the dead being put into shiny black body bags.</p><p>How could she have forgotten such a horrible ordeal?</p><p>And then there was the way Rhys had spirited them out of the stadium. How had he done that? And why couldn\u2019t she remember? She drummed her fingertips on the edge of the table. One minute she had been inside the burning building and the next she had been across the street with no memory of how they had gotten there. Had Rhys been right? Had she been so afraid she had blocked it from her mind?</p><p>One thing she did know. If it hadn\u2019t been for Rhys, she probably wouldn\u2019t have made it out of the building alive. She read the names of the deceased again. Six of them had been teenagers. One had been a young mother. The last fatality had been a member of the band. Four firemen had suffered smoke inhalation; three had been hospitalized with severe burns. The building was a total loss.</p><p>Megan was trying to work up an appetite when Shirl entered the kitchen, looking gorgeous in a pair of snowflake pj\u2019s and pink bunny slippers. \u201cHey, girlfriend, I didn\u2019t expect you to be up so early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost noon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, after the night you had...\u201d Shirl lifted one shoulder and let it fall. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be out most of the day.\u201d</p><p>Megan frowned. She had expected to have nightmares last night, or at least to have trouble sleeping, but she had slept like a baby. There had been no bad dreams, and when she woke this morning, she hadn\u2019t even thought of the fire until she read about it in the paper. How could she have forgotten something so traumatic, she wondered again. She pondered that a moment, trying to wrap her mind around the strangeness of it.</p><p>\u201cHave you eaten?\u201d Shirl asked.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you in the mood for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you need to eat.\u201d Moving to the fridge, Shirl opened the door. \u201cHow about French toast? Waffles? Pancakes? Scrambled eggs, hash browns, and bacon?\u201d She glanced over her shoulder. \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPancakes and bacon sounds good.\u201d</p><p>When Megan started to get up, Shirl waved her off. \u201cI\u2019ll do it. You just relax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShirl...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Megan ran her finger around the rim of her cup, and then, taking a deep breath, she told Shirl what was bothering her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s odd?\u201d Megan asked when she finished. \u201cI mean...\u201d She shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s like I completely forgot about the fire and everything that happened last night.\u201d</p><p>After mixing the pancake batter, Shirl pulled a frying pan from under the stove for the bacon. \u201cIt does seem odd, but maybe it\u2019s not uncommon. I mean, it was a horrible experience. Maybe your subconscious just wasn\u2019t ready to handle it when you woke up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but I can\u2019t help thinking there\u2019s more to it...something I can\u2019t put my finger on. It\u2019s like, I don\u2019t know, somebody wiped it from my memory. I guess that sounds really strange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then...you know, I don\u2019t remember getting out of the building. It\u2019s like, one minute we were inside, and the next we were across the street. Rhys said the reason I don\u2019t remember is because I was so scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that makes sense, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess. It just seems so, I don\u2019t know, weird.\u201d</p><p>Shirl sighed heavily. \u201cGirlfriend, the whole world is weird these days. I mean, have you read about all those deaths back East? Bodies drained of blood. It\u2019s like we\u2019re living in the twilight zone.\u201d She turned the bacon, then began ladling batter onto the griddle. \u201cOne of the news channels mentioned vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVampires! Are you serious?\u201d Megan tilted her head to one side. \u201cYou\u2019re loving this, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not, but it is kind of exciting. Get the syrup and the butter, will you?\u201d</p><p>Vampires, Megan thought, as she set the syrup and the butter on the table, along with a couple of knives and forks. There were rumors of creatures of the night from time to time. It seemed that whenever there was a mysterious death, some reporter attributed it to werewolves or vampires. She had even heard that you could buy vampire blood on the Internet, but she had laughed it off, certain it was either a joke or just some kind of fake blood for the Goth crowd.</p><p>Megan sat down at the table across from Shirl. \u201cLooks great, thanks,\u201d she said, and then did a double take when Shirl actually put a pancake and a strip of bacon on her own plate. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it. You\u2019re eating real food?\u201d</p><p>Shirl blew out an aggrieved sigh. \u201cI deserve it. Besides, I\u2019m on vacation for a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know that. What are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreg has a cabin up in the mountains. He wants to go up there, but I don\u2019t know....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should go. It\u2019ll be good for you to get away for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I should leave you alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly. I\u2019m fine. Really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? I mean, Greg and I can find plenty to do here in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShirl, I\u2019m a big girl, remember? I think I can get along without you for a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I really would like to go,\u201d Shirl admitted with a dreamy smile.</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s settled.\u201d Megan slapped her palms on the table. \u201cWhen are you leaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow morning. Early. And we\u2019ll be back next Sunday, not too late, since I have a shoot on Monday.\u201d</p><p>Megan nodded. \u201cI think it\u2019s just what you need. You\u2019ve been working way too hard lately. I\u2019ll help you pack.\u201d</p><p>The rest of the day passed quickly. Megan dusted and vacuumed. Shirl did the laundry. Since they\u2019d had such a late breakfast, they skipped lunch and splurged on hot fudge sundaes instead.</p><p>After packing Shirl\u2019s suitcase, they went out to their favorite Italian restaurant for dinner.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Shirl said, reaching for a bread stick still warm from the oven, \u201cwhat are you going to do about Rhys Costain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Megan propped her elbows on the table and rested her chin on her folded hands. \u201cWhen I\u2019m with him, he makes me feel wonderful, beautiful. Special. Safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when you\u2019re not with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know he\u2019s hiding something,\u201d Megan said. \u201cI just don\u2019t know what it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you be careful. I\u2019ll call you from the cabin tomorrow night. And I\u2019ll keep my phone on in case you need me.\u201d</p><p>Shirl hadn\u2019t been kidding when she\u2019d said Greg was picking her up early in the morning. Greg arrived at six, bid a sleepy-eyed Megan a quick hello and good-bye, and whisked Shirl away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Megan waved as the car pulled out of the driveway, and then went back to bed, only to get up an hour later. She made her bed, fixed breakfast, did the dishes, and got dressed, and it was only eight thirty.</p><p>She had expected to enjoy having the place all to herself for a few days; instead, she was overcome with a feeling of depression. Even though there were days when Megan didn\u2019t see Shirl at all, it was comforting to know that, sooner or later, Shirl would come home from work and there would be another warm body in the house.</p><p>The day stretched before her. At loose ends, Megan went to the local day spa and indulged herself\u2014she had a facial and a full body massage, swam in the heated pool, spent some time in the meditation garden before leaving for home. On the way, she stopped and picked up some Chinese takeout for dinner.</p> <p>When she reached home, it was only six o\u2019clock. Would this day never end?</p><p>The house seemed incredibly empty without Shirl. After eating, Megan went upstairs to take a shower, donned her favorite pj\u2019s, and then went downstairs. Curling up on the sofa, hugging a pillow to her chest, she surfed through the channels.</p><p>\u201cFive hundred channels,\u201d she muttered, \u201cand there\u2019s nothing worth watching.\u201d</p><p>As always, she eventually found her thoughts turning toward Rhys. How did she really feel about him? She had told Shirl she thought he was hiding something, but what? The most likely secret would be a wife. Or worse, a wife and a couple of kids. Maybe it was something even more damning. Lord, what if he was a sex offender or a felon? He certainly knew how to take care of himself. He had taken those two would-be robbers at Shore\u2019s down in the blink of an eye. And then there was his quick thinking at the concert. She still didn\u2019t know how he had gotten the two of them out of that burning building without a scratch.</p><p>She drummed her fingertips on the arm of the sofa. Where had he learned to react to danger with such blinding speed? Maybe he belonged to some Special Ops organization, or the CIA, or maybe the DEA. Maybe he taught martial arts. She blew out a sigh. Maybe she\u2019d never know.</p> <p>She was thinking about going to bed when the doorbell rang. Her heartbeat immediately jumped into overdrive.</p><p>It was Rhys. She knew it with every fiber of her being. She wished fleetingly that she was wearing something more alluring than pj\u2019s and a tank top, but there was no help for it now.</p><p>She forced herself to take three slow, deep breaths before she opened the door. And he was there. Dressed all in black, he blended with the shadows, a part of the night and the darkness.</p><p>\u201cMegan.\u201d His voice, soft and low, yet filled with heat and desire. It wrapped around her, seeping into her very being. \u201cI thought you might like some company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019m alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t Shirl leave town this morning?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, but how did you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe must have mentioned it the other night, after you fell asleep.\u201d The lie rolled easily off his tongue.</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, come on in. To tell you the truth, I was feeling a little lonely.\u201d</p><p>He followed her into the living room, sat beside her on the sofa. Not too close. He was well aware of her ambivalent feelings toward him. It was time to reestablish trust, assure her that she had nothing to fear. He jerked his chin toward the TV. \u201cWhat are you watching?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, really. I was about to turn it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not put some music on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d She found an all-music channel that played soft rock.</p><p>\u201cWould you care to dance?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat? Here, now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not here?\u201d Rising, he reached for her hand.</p><p>Why not, indeed, Megan thought. Putting her hand in his, she let him pull her to her feet.</p><p>Dancing with Rhys wasn\u2019t like dancing with anyone else. He moved effortlessly, fluidly. She wasn\u2019t any great shakes as a dancer, but he held her so close, it didn\u2019t matter. Her body moved with his as though they had danced together for years instead of only once before. But dancing at the club hadn\u2019t been anything like this. They were alone now, just the two of them. It was exhilarating, being in his arms, feeling his breath against her cheek, seeing the heat in his eyes. She had once heard someone describe dancing as vertical sex. With Rhys, it was definitely true. Her hormones sat up and took notice every time his body brushed against hers.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trembling,\u201d he remarked.</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you cold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d How could she be when he was looking at her with such blatant desire?</p><p>\u201cAfraid?\u201d</p><p>She blinked up at him. She was afraid, afraid she would wake up in her bed and discover that this was only a dream. Afraid that when the music stopped, he would disappear. But she couldn\u2019t tell him that.</p><p>The music changed to something slow and sensual. His arms tightened around her, drawing her even closer. \u201cMegan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKiss me, Rhys.\u201d</p><p>If her request surprised him, it didn\u2019t show.</p><p>She closed her eyes as he bent his head toward her. Her heart slammed against her rib cage when his lips met hers. Heat flowed through every nerve and cell, turning her blood to fire, threatening to melt her bones.</p><p>\u201cAh, Megan, do you know what you do to me?\u201d His gaze moved to the pulse throbbing wildly in the hollow of her throat. The rapid pounding of her heart was like the beat of a drum only he could hear. \u201cDo you have any idea how difficult it is not to...\u201d Muttering an oath, he released her and stepped away.</p><p>Confused, she wrapped her arms around her waist to keep from reaching for him. Had she done something wrong? Displeased him in some way? Disappointed him?</p><p>Seeing her bewildered expression, Rhys drew her back into his embrace. If he was smart, he would leave now and never see her again. The longer he was with her, the harder it would be to let her go. Even though he cared deeply for her, he knew, realistically, that there was no future for the two of them.</p><p>There was no denying that she was attracted to him, but then, most women were. He had no way of knowing how much of that attraction was due to the inherent allure all vampires possessed, and how much was genuine affection.</p><p>For his part, he hadn\u2019t felt this way about a woman since Josette. Closing his eyes, he opened his senses, basking in the feel of the woman in his arms, the flowery perfume of her hair, the musky scent of her skin.</p><p>She wanted him.</p><p>But no more than he wanted her. \u201cMegan?\u201d</p><p>He liked it that she didn\u2019t pretend she didn\u2019t know what he was asking.</p><p>A flush crept up her neck and into her cheeks as she took his hand in hers and led him up the stairs to her bedroom.</p><p>Once in her room, Megan was overcome with uncertainty. What was she doing? Did she really want to hop into bed with a man she had known for such a short time? A man she had been having serious doubts about only yesterday? Even thinking about taking him to bed was totally out of character for her. Still, she was a big girl, and it had been a long time since she\u2019d had this particular itch scratched.</p><p>\u201cMegan?\u201d His voice surrounded her, winding around her like a silken web from which there was no escape.</p><p>She shivered with pleasure as he bestowed featherlight kisses along the side of her neck, along her collarbone to the hollow of her throat. Yes, this was what she wanted. This man. Right now.</p><p>For once in her life, she was going to leap before she looked. For once in her life, she wasn\u2019t going to play it safe.</p><p>As if he knew she had resolved her inner conflict, he pulled her up against him, his hand sliding seductively up and down her spine.</p><p>She had to touch him. Tugging his T-shirt from his jeans, she ran her hands over his chest, felt his muscles tense at her touch.</p><p>Still holding her against him, he backed her toward the bed and then, supporting her with his arms, he lowered her to the mattress before stretching out beside her.</p><p>\u201cRhys...\u201d Murmuring his name, she explored the width of his shoulders, the taut planes and ridges of his chest and belly.</p><p>Knowing what she wanted, he yanked his T-shirt over his head and tossed it aside, giving her access to his upper body.</p><p>Turning onto her side, she explored the width of his shoulders, the whorls of curly hair on his chest, the hard ridges of his stomach. She paused now and then to kiss him here, lick him there. Growing bolder, she pulled off his boots and his socks, and then, after a moment\u2019s hesitation, she tugged his jeans down over his slim hips. The black briefs he wore did nothing to hide the fact that he wanted her.</p><p>He let her explore his body from head to foot, and then he turned the tables on her. \u201cMy turn,\u201d he said, his voice thick, and in the time it took her to blink, she was lying naked beneath him, and he had begun a slow exploration of his own.</p><p>His hands were large yet gentle as they played over her quivering flesh. The touch of his cool skin did nothing to douse the flames that threatened to consume her from the inside out. Each stroke of his hands, each heated caress, carried her to a place where she had never been before, a place she hoped never to leave. She had made love in the past, but it had never been like this. Never before had she so desperately wanted or needed a man\u2019s touch. Never before had she known such wonder, such pleasure.</p><p>He murmured her name as he shucked his briefs, and then he rose over her, blatantly male and aroused.</p><p>With a throaty growl, she wrapped her arms around his neck, her legs around his waist, and lifted her hips to meet him.</p><p>One thrust, and she felt like she might shatter. She clung to him as the world spun out of focus. Never had she been so aware of her own body, or felt so vibrantly alive. She had heard of two bodies becoming one, but their joining went beyond that. It was as if their hearts and souls had seamlessly melded, so that she knew what he was thinking, what he was feeling. She knew where he wanted to be touched, just as he seemed to know exactly how to please her.</p><p>And please her he did, with every caress, every murmured word, until one last thrust carried her over the edge to blissful fulfillment.</p><p>Sated and complete, she murmured his name and then, with a sigh, she closed her eyes and fell into the warm abyss of slumber. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rhys stayed at Megan\u2019s side long after she had fallen asleep. Gazing down at her, he wondered if she would have second thoughts or regrets when she woke in the morning. It had been a long time since she had been intimate with a man. What would she think if she knew her latest lover was not a man at all?</p><p>He wondered absently if she was using any kind of birth control. Not that it mattered. He carried no diseases. He could not father a child. It was the one thing that bothered him about being a vampire. Not that he would have made a good father, not that he had ever really wanted kids, but he would have liked to have had the option just the same. It was the one thing he had always envied about his friend, Delacourt. Erik had been a married man with children before he was turned. It was possible that Delacourt still had descendants living somewhere in England.</p><p>Muttering an oath, Rhys dropped a kiss on Megan\u2019s cheek, dressed, and left the house.</p> <p>Filled with a sudden anger he refused to examine, he headed for his club. Even though it was late, there were still a few men and women lingering over drinks at the bar.</p><p>Rhys looked the women over, made his choice, and tapped her on the shoulder. When she started to speak, he silenced her with a look. He didn\u2019t want conversation tonight, he didn\u2019t want anything except a few minutes of forgetfulness.</p><p>The woman followed him into one of the rooms and closed the door. When she started to undress, he shook his head. He didn\u2019t want an hour of meaningless sex; he didn\u2019t want to seek comfort in the arms of a stranger. What the hell did he want?</p><p>Megan. Her name whispered in the back of his mind as he pulled the woman, none too gently, into his arms and buried his fangs in her throat. This was what he was, who he was. He would never be good enough for Megan DeLacey, never be able to give her the kind of life she deserved. He needed to remember that.</p><p>He lifted his head and stared at the woman in his embrace. And then he lowered his head and drank again. This is what you are, whispered a mocking voice in the back of his mind. A monster.</p> <p>He drew back as his victim\u2019s heartbeat grew slow and erratic. If he drank any more, the girl would die. Odd that he should worry about that now. He had rarely given much thought to the fate of his prey before. In the past, he had attacked men and women without a qualm, taken what he needed without regret, and if his victims didn\u2019t survive, he had shrugged it off. Humans were prey. He was a predator. It had been as simple as that. Until the night he stepped into Shore\u2019s and gazed into Megan DeLacey\u2019s guileless brown eyes.</p><p>With an oath, he sealed the wounds in the woman\u2019s neck and lowered her onto the bed. After ordering the bartender to take care of her, he left the club without a backward glance and headed for home.</p><p>And all the while, the word monster echoed in the back of his mind.</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>Tom\u00e1s lifted his head, his senses drinking in the sights and sounds of the evening countryside. He had left the Ferretti behind when he left Texas. As much as he loved the yacht, there was a lot to be said for the speed and power of a fine car, and the sleek, black Lamborghini Murcielago convertible was fine indeed, able to accelerate from zero to sixty in just over three seconds.</p><p>Tom\u00e1s smiled as he goosed the convertible up to ninety. As much as he had enjoyed his stay in Texas, boredom had eventually set in, urging him to seek new hunting grounds, new prey. A new method of transportation. Hence the Lamborghini, which he had purchased on the spur of the moment. He had hired someone to sail the yacht to San Diego.</p> <p>He wondered idly if humans realized how long eternity could be, how monotonous life became when one had seen all there was to see, done all there was to do. For a moment, he considered settling down for a while, taking a wife, pretending to be human. How many times had he done that in the past? A hundred? Two? Inevitably, when his wife began to age and he did not, he had to move on. Occasionally, he turned those he wed, but he was too selfish, too territorial, to share his hunting grounds with anyone else, even someone he cared for. All things considered, it was better to live alone.</p><p>He grinned inwardly. Perhaps he could find the excitement he was looking for in New Mexico, the Land of Enchantment.</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>Rhys let his glance sweep the faces of the Vampire Council. \u201cThe rogue is on the move again,\u201d he said, his voice gruff. \u201cHe\u2019s racking up killings from one end of New Mexico to the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it isn\u2019t an old one,\u201d Seth Adams suggested. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s newly turned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be,\u201d Stuart agreed. \u201cMaybe whoever sired him neglected to show him the ropes, so to speak.\u201d</p><p>Rupert shook his head. \u201cNo, it\u2019s definitely one of the old ones. I told you, a trusted friend of mine saw one of the victims. He said the vamp responsible was definitely ancient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I guess the next step is to try to pin down where the old ones are,\u201d Rhys said. \u201cAdrianna, New Mexico is your home base. Call around and see what you can find out. I want the rest of you to get in touch with the vampires in your areas and see if any of the old ones have moved on. Once we know who\u2019s where they should be, and who isn\u2019t, we can start to narrow the list.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI still don\u2019t know why you\u2019re so bothered by all this,\u201d Julius said. \u201cSo what if a few humans come looking for us?\u201d</p><p>Rhys glared at him. \u201cWhat if it\u2019s more than a few? There\u2019s already a new hunter in LA. He\u2019s probably heard about the killings. Just because we haven\u2019t heard of hunters in other cities doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t there. We\u2019ve had it pretty easy the last few years. Most of the human population has more important things to worry about than whether we exist or not. But if this rogue keeps killing, eventually people are going to sit up and take notice. I don\u2019t know about you, but I like things the way they are. And what if some of the young ones decide to stop being careful?\u201d Rhys glanced around the room. He had their attention now. \u201cI don\u2019t care what the rogue does back East, but he\u2019s heading in this direction. I like it here. I\u2019m not ready to pack up and move on. What about you, Hastings? You ready to leave Oregon? And what about you, Winchester? You ready to give up your place in Montana? How about you, Nick? You ready to move on?\u201d</p><p>Nick shook his head. \u201cNo. You said he\u2019s in New Mexico. How about if I go there and see what I can find out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need any help,\u201d Adrianna declared.</p><p>\u201cMaybe not,\u201d Nick said, \u201cbut I\u2019m tired of sitting around, waiting.\u201d He looked at Rhys expectantly.</p><p>\u201cMight be a good idea to have someone there. Take Adams with you.\u201d</p><p>Adams reared back in his chair. \u201cWhat? I don\u2019t want to go to New Mexico!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho does?\u201d Julius asked, laughing.</p><p>\u201cNew Mexico is my home,\u201d Adrianna said. \u201cIf you want someone to look around, I\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>Rhys sent her a quelling glance. He didn\u2019t like Adrianna, and he didn\u2019t trust her. Better to keep her close, where he could keep an eye on her. \u201cWe\u2019ll play it my way for now,\u201d he decided. \u201cNick and Seth are going to New Mexico. The rest of you get busy and check the lairs of the old ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Adrianna asked.</p><p>\u201cCheck my own sources,\u201d Rhys retorted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been a little testy the last few days,\u201d Stuart observed. \u201cAnything we need to know about? We don\u2019t usually meet this often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Winchester looked up from his cell phone. \u201cMust be woman trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis meeting is over,\u201d Rhys said. \u201cGet the hell out of here, all of you.\u201d</p><p>Jaw clenched, he watched them vanish one by one, but not before Adrianna clapped Winchester on the back and said, \u201cI think you nailed it that time.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>Megan was glad to be back to work on Tuesday night. She had rattled around the house all that day, trying to reassure herself that she hadn\u2019t made a big mistake the night before. She had fallen asleep in Rhys\u2019s arms, and expected to awake there, as well. But he had been gone when she awoke, almost as if he had never been there at all. She couldn\u2019t believe he would just leave without a word, not after the romantic night they had shared. She had been certain she would find a note saying he would see her again later, which just proved how wrong she could be. She had searched the house for a note that didn\u2019t exist, waited all day for a phone call that never came. Had he been stringing her along the whole time, just waiting to get her into bed? Silly question, she thought, when the answer seemed obvious. How could she have been such an idiot?</p><p>She let out a sigh as one of her least favorite customers swept into the store. In his midsixties, Richard Archibald Clark was the CEO of a major corporation based in the heart of downtown Los Angeles.</p><p>\u201cMegan, my dear,\u201d he exclaimed, wrapping her in a bear hug. \u201cYou\u2019ve had a horrible couple of weeks, haven\u2019t you? First the attempted robbery, and then the fire at the Drexel concert.\u201d He tsked softly. \u201cParker gave me all details. Terrible, just terrible.\u201d Holding her at arm\u2019s length, he ran his gaze over her. \u201cPraise the Lord, you look none the worse for wear.\u201d</p><p>Disengaging herself, Megan forced a smile. \u201cThank you for your concern, Mr. Clark, but I\u2019m fine now, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my brave girl.\u201d Mr. Clark shrugged out of his coat and tossed it to his assistant, Vi. Vi was a mousy little thing somewhere in her midthirties. Megan had never heard the woman speak a word.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in need of a new suit,\u201d Mr. Clark said, all business once again. \u201cSomething dark, no stripes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we have just what you\u2019re looking for,\u201d Megan replied, moving toward the north side of the store.</p><p>\u201cYes, you always do,\u201d Mr. Clark said, beaming at her.</p><p>An hour and a half later, Megan breathed a sigh of relief when Mr. Clark and his assistant left the shop.</p><p>Several customers came and went over the course of the next three hours, and then, as sometimes happened, there was a lull around midnight. Force of habit had Megan looking toward the entrance every few minutes, but there was no sign of Rhys. She checked her cell phone, but there were no missed calls, no messages. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She moped all day Wednesday. By Thursday night, she was angry with Rhys, and furious with herself. How could she have been so naive? She wasn\u2019t a dewy-eyed teenager. She was a grown woman. So, she\u2019d made a mistake. It was time to get past it. She had been attracted to the man, there was no denying it. So attracted she had slept with him, but she told herself she didn\u2019t care. It was over and done.</p><p>As the evening wore on, she convinced herself she hadn\u2019t even liked him that much. She had just been lonely, looking for a little attention, and she had gotten carried away because he was so damned good-looking. Because he had made her feel special. Because his kisses had made her go weak in the knees.</p><p>\u201cHah! Weak in the head is more like it!\u201d she muttered. A few kisses, a few dances, a few compliments, and she had taken him to her bed. How could she have been so gullible? So incredibly stupid! Well, she was glad he was out of her life, the jerk. And relieved that she would never have to see him again.</p> <p>Until she saw him walk through the door Friday night.</p><p>Rhys paused near the entrance, his gaze sweeping the interior of the shop; then, not caring that Mr. Parker was watching, not certain of what Megan\u2019s reaction would be, Rhys crossed to where Megan was standing and drew her into his arms.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispered, and kissed her long and hard, right there in front of her boss and anyone passing by who happened to look in the window.</p><p>He kissed her until she was breathless, pliant in his embrace, and then he kissed her again. \u201cI missed you.\u201d</p><p>She blinked up at him, her lips slightly swollen from the force of his kisses.</p> <p>In the distance, Mr. Parker cleared his throat as a customer entered the store.</p><p>Muttering an oath, Rhys took a step away from Megan, though he continued to hold her gaze with his own. \u201cCan I see you later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She blinked several times as though to clear her head.</p><p>\u201cCan I see you later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She touched her fingertips to her lips. \u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTill then,\u201d he said with a wink, and left the store, whistling softly.</p> <p>He was a fool, Rhys thought, no two ways about it. But three days without seeing Megan had proved to him, once and for all, that he didn\u2019t want to live without her. No doubt he would be hurt in the end. Sooner or later, she was bound to discover what he was, and the preternatural shit would hit the fan, but until then, he planned to spend as much time with her as he could. And when it was over...well, he\u2019d worry about that when it happened.</p><p>But for now, he had a date.</p><p>He was at the back door at two A.M. sharp, waiting for her. One look, and Megan wanted to throw herself into his arms. She had to remind herself that she was still mad at him for making love to her and then letting three whole days and nights go by without a word.</p><p>As though reading her mind, he drew her into his arms. \u201cForgive me?\u201d he asked, and kissed her.</p><p>Megan tried to hold onto her irritation, but with his lips on hers, it was impossible. When he finally let her come up for air, she said the words she had been wanting to say, even though she feared it would be a mistake. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Dammit, why hadn\u2019t he seen that coming? \u201cMegan.\u201d</p><p>Shoulders slumped, she looked away. She knew it! Why hadn\u2019t she just kept her big mouth shut?</p><p>\u201cMegan, look at me.\u201d</p> <p>Still not meeting his gaze, she said, \u201cForget I said anything. I\u2019m going home.\u201d</p><p>Rhys blew out a sigh, his arms tightening around her when she tried to pull away. \u201cDammit, Megan, you don\u2019t know how complicated this is.\u201d He knew she was attracted to him. Why hadn\u2019t he realized that a woman like Megan DeLacey wouldn\u2019t take a man to her bed unless she loved him? Maybe coming here tonight hadn\u2019t been such a good idea after all. But when he thought of leaving her again, he just couldn\u2019t do it.</p><p>She met his gaze, her eyes sparking with anger. \u201cLet me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down, woman. You must know I love you, too, or I wouldn\u2019t be here now.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, her eyes shiny with unshed tears.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said, slipping his arm around her shoulders. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>Megan unlocked her car, then handed him the keys, and he drove her home. She was a bundle of nerves by the time they pulled into the driveway. Rhys parked the car, then came around to open her door.</p><p>Hand in hand, they walked up the porch steps. Megan unlocked the front door, felt her heartbeat jump into double-time when he swung her into his arms and carried her across the threshold.</p><p>Like a bride, she thought, resting her head on his shoulder.</p><p>They didn\u2019t talk as he carried her up the stairs to her room. Setting her on her feet, he removed her shoes one at a time, his hand lingering on her calf, and then, ever so slowly, he undressed her, his gaze and his hands caressing each inch of exposed flesh.</p><p>When she stood naked in front of him, he sat on the edge of the bed and pulled off his boots, then started to remove his shirt, but she batted his hands away. \u201cMy turn.\u201d</p><p>A faint smile played over his lips as she peeled off his shirt and his trousers. She hesitated when only his briefs remained.</p><p>\u201cNothing you haven\u2019t seen before,\u201d he said, and laughed when her cheeks turned bright pink.</p><p>Spanning her waist with his hands, he fell back on the bed, drawing her down on top of him. He kissed her lightly, his hands sliding up and down her back, reveling in the feel of her bare skin beneath his fingertips, the little purr of contentment that rose in her throat.</p><p>Rolling onto his side, he drew her body up against his. He liked it that she could be bold one minute and bashful the next. He liked the way she looked at him, the way she moaned softly as he aroused her, the way her body welcomed his.</p><p>In spite of his vow not to drink from her, he couldn\u2019t resist the allure of her blood. Holding her close, he nipped lightly at the soft flesh beneath her ear and, when she didn\u2019t object, he bit a little deeper. He took only a small taste, reveling in the sweetness as her blood flowed over his tongue.</p><p>Megan moaned low in her throat. She didn\u2019t know what Rhys was doing but she hoped he would never stop. Heat sizzled through her, heightening her desire until she was lost in a hazy world of sensual pleasure, uncertain of where he ended and she began.</p><p>She cried his name aloud, her nails digging into the hard muscles of his back, as heat spiraled through her, erupting into flames that threatened to consume her. She held onto him, her body writhing restlessly beneath his, until the fire cooled and she lay sated and content in his arms.</p><p>Rhys rolled onto his side, carrying her with him, so that they lay face-to-face, their bodies still meshed. Megan felt like purring as his hand lightly stroked her back.</p><p>Murmuring his name, she closed her eyes, and fell asleep.</p><p>Rhys gazed at the vision in his arms. Warm and womanly, she carried the fragrance of flowers in her hair, the musky scent of sex\u2014hers and his\u2014on her skin. It pleased him that he had satisfied her as no other. He had shamelessly read her mind, knew that no other man had ever pleasured her as he had. The knowledge stroked his ego. Not that satisfying women had ever been a problem for him, before or after he became a vampire. Women had always been drawn to him. He had loved them and left them without a qualm. But Megan, ah, sweet Megan with her honey-brown eyes and tender heart, she was different. If he lived to be a thousand, he knew he would never forget her.</p><p>A familiar tingling warned of dawn\u2019s approach. He could feel the sun long before it was visible.</p><p>If only he could stay. If only he could make love to her each night, see her face upon waking. He had never regretted being a vampire. Once he had been turned, he had faced it, accepted it, and moved on. But now, for the first time in his long existence, he knew he would gladly give up immortality for the chance to spend one mortal lifetime in this woman\u2019s arms.</p><p>Slipping out of bed, he dressed quickly, then stood at her bedside, debating whether to wake her. He decided against it. It would be dawn soon, no time to stay and make love to her again as he so longed to do.</p><p>Murmuring, \u201cI love you,\u201d he brushed a kiss across her cheek and left the house, hoping he had time for one quick errand.</p><p>Megan woke feeling wonderful until she looked to her left and saw that she was alone in bed. Again. And then she smiled. Once again, Rhys had left her after a night of lovemaking, but she couldn\u2019t be angry this time, not when the blankets were covered with vibrant red rose petals. Not when there were vases of flowers on every surface in the room. Not when she read the note he had left on his pillow:</p><p>Megan, my love.</p><p>You will be in my thoughts,</p><p>and in my heart,</p><p>until I hold you in</p><p>my arms once again.</p><p>RC</p><p>Picking up the note, she kissed it, then slid out of bed. She couldn\u2019t stop smiling, not while she showered, not while she pulled on a pair of sweats. She scooped up the loose petals and dropped them in a bowl before making the bed.</p><p>Taking a rose from one of the vases on the dresser, she plucked the petals one by one. \u201cHe loves me, he loves me not, he loves me....\u201d She knew it was foolish, but she couldn\u2019t help shouting with joy as the last petal proved that he loved her. It was nonsense, a child\u2019s game, but it reassured her just the same.</p><p>Tucking his note in the pocket of her sweatpants, she went downstairs. There were more flowers in the living room, on the tables, on the mantel. Red ones, white ones, pink and yellow ones. And still more in the kitchen, on the table, on the counter, on top of the refrigerator.</p><p>At home and later at work, it seemed the hours would never pass. Time and again she patted the note in the pocket of her dress for reassurance. He loved her. She would see him soon.</p><p>Rhys sat in his car in the parking lot at Shore\u2019s, his phone pressed to his ear. He scowled when Nicholas informed him that there had been two killings in Las Cruces, three in Albuquerque, and at least five in Santa Fe. \u201cWhat else have you found out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Nick admitted. \u201cThe killer\u2019s as elusive as Jack the Ripper. So, what do you want us to do now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep looking.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAdams is getting on my nerves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?

No one liked Adrianna.</p><p>Entering the store, he put all thoughts of hunters and vampires out of his mind. These few hours were his. When he was with Megan, he didn\u2019t care if the rest of the world went to hell.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>Sitting beneath a cottonwood tree in Alamogordo, Tom\u00e1s Villagrande gazed up at the vast vault of the sky. With his preternatural vision, he saw many more of the heavenly bodies than did mere mortals. Whether at sea or ashore, he had always been fascinated by the night sky, had often wondered if there was indeed life on other planets. Of course, he didn\u2019t believe in aliens\u2014either gray or white or green. The one thing he did believe in\u2014the one thing he feared\u2014was the existence of a supreme being. Believing in heaven, he also believed in hell. And judgment. Should his own existence ever end, he knew he would have to account for the hundreds of lives he had taken.</p><p>With a sigh of disgust, he shook such thoughts away. He had no intention of ending his existence any time soon. And worrying about what awaited him was pointless. He couldn\u2019t change the past, couldn\u2019t resurrect the people he had killed, or the ones he had loved.</p> <p>And he had loved many since he became a vampire. He grinned. \u201cSo many women,\u201d he murmured. \u201cSo much time.\u201d</p><p>He had loved a woman from Alamogordo back in the 1800s. A pretty little Navajo girl with tawny skin, long ebony hair, and bright black eyes. Alamogordo had changed a lot since those days. Once a small railroad, ranching, and farming community, it was now a thriving metropolis. Not far away stood Oliver Lee State Park. In the past, numerous battles had taken place there between the Indians and the cavalry. Today, it was a historic landmark.</p><p>Yes, he mused, the city had changed and grown. Alamogordo was also home to Holloman Air Force Base and the White Sands Missile Range. Mortals never changed, he thought with a rueful shake of his head. They were always looking for new and better ways to destroy themselves.</p><p>Rising, he strolled through the desert, enjoying the quiet, the moonlight. Animal predators gave him a wide birth, sensing a killer even more deadly than themselves.</p><p>Pausing, he stretched his arms over his head. It was time to move on. He had a score to settle with an old friend on the West Coast.</p><p>He grinned as he made his way toward his temporary lair, then began humming, \u201cCalifornia, here I come....\u201d</p> <p>Chapter 17</p><p>Rhys heaved a sigh as his gaze moved over the faces of the Vampire Council. As usual, none of the members were happy to be there. Winchester was slouched in his chair, cell phone in hand. Nicholas was paring his fingernails with a wicked-looking blade.</p><p>Adrianna smoothed a wrinkle from her skirt, then looked up, a pout on her pale lips. \u201cHave you forgotten you\u2019re a vampire?\u201d she asked, a whine evident in her tone. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all these early meetings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s probably got a date again,\u201d Julius replied with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cIndeed?\u201d Rupert perked up, his dark eyes glowing. \u201cDoes she have a friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, that\u2019s enough!\u201d Rhys said, scowling. \u201cWe\u2019re not here to set up a dating service.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what are we here for?\u201d Nicholas asked. \u201cNot that I\u2019m complaining,\u201d he added quickly. \u201cBut I\u2019d rather be home.\u201d</p><p>Rhys nodded. One of his vampires had reported several killings in Phoenix, leading Rhys to believe that the rogue had left New Mexico. He had ordered Nicholas and Seth Adams back to LA the following night.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s obvious the rogue isn\u2019t staying long in any one place.\u201d Rhys leaned back in his chair, his elbows resting on the arms, fingers steepled.</p><p>\u201cAnd just as obvious that he\u2019s heading in our direction,\u201d Adams remarked.</p><p>Adrianna turned her gaze on Rhys. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s coming in your direction.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring her, Rhys said, \u201cI\u2019m getting tired of asking this question, but have any of you heard anything?\u201d</p><p>As usual, they had nothing concrete to report. There were rumors\u2014Morag had gone to ground; Sandoval had left Spain; a young vampire had challenged Baiba for Russia and been destroyed\u2014but then, there were always rumors. They flew thick and fast in the vampire world.</p><p>Rhys dismissed them all out of hand. The only one that piqued his interest concerned Tom\u00e1s Villagrande. One of the East Coast vampires had told Rupert that Villagrande\u2019s yacht was no longer anchored off the coast of New York.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think he\u2019s the rogue, do you?\u201d Adrianna asked, glancing nervously around the room. \u201cYou don\u2019t think he\u2019s coming here?\u201d</p><p>Hastings leaned forward. \u201cYou got a problem with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not! Why should I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Hastings said, his brow furrowing thoughtfully. \u201cYou tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there something going on we need to know about?\u201d Rhys asked. \u201cIf so, spit it out now.\u201d</p><p>Adrianna squared her shoulders. \u201cWe had a little disagreement some years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of a disagreement?\u201d Hastings asked.</p><p>\u201cNone of your business,\u201d Adrianna retorted.</p><p>Winchester looked up from his cell phone.</p><p>Adams and Hastings exchanged glances.</p><p>Rupert looked at Rhys, waiting for his reaction.</p><p>\u201cNone of our business?\u201d Rhys repeated, his voice like ice over steel. \u201cIn light of current events, you might want to rethink that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had a squabble a long time ago, that\u2019s all. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s forgotten all about it by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that right?\u201d Rhys asked. \u201cWhat did you squabble about?\u201d</p><p>When Adrianna didn\u2019t answer immediately, Julius said, \u201cIt\u2019s gotta be one of two things. Territory or prey. What else is there?\u201d</p><p>Rhys nodded, his gaze on Adrianna\u2019s face. \u201cWhich one was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerritory,\u201d she replied sullenly. \u201cI wanted to stay in Maine. He wouldn\u2019t let me.\u201d</p><p>Hastings shook his head. \u201cThere\u2019s got to be more to it than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so, too,\u201d Rhys said. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d When Adrianna didn\u2019t answer, he trapped her gaze with his. \u201cI can make you tell me,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you won\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>She glared at him, her expression mutinous. \u201cI killed a woman he had marked as his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t very bright of you,\u201d Hastings remarked.</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, that\u2019s enough,\u201d Rhys said. \u201cIf Villagrande\u2019s coming here, I doubt it\u2019s to avenge something that happened years ago. If he wanted to destroy Adrianna, he\u2019d likely have done it by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why else would he be coming here?\u201d Nicholas asked.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he just wants to sail in the Pacific for a while,\u201d Rupert suggested. \u201cHell, don\u2019t we all like a change of scene every fifty years or so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a damn where he makes port,\u201d Rhys said, \u201cbut if he starts killing in my territory...\u201d He shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think you can take him?\u201d Julius asked, his close-set brown eyes glittering at the thought of two ancient vampires battling one another.</p><p>Winchester shook his head. \u201cVillagrande\u2019s never been bested in a fight, we all know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a first time for everything,\u201d Adams said.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t getting us anywhere,\u201d Rhys remarked, getting to his feet. \u201cSee yourselves out. I\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p><p>Outside, Rhys slid behind the wheel of the Jag, then pulled away from the curb, his thoughts turned inward. He supposed it had only been a matter of time until trouble rolled into town again. He caught a faint scent of the hunter as he drove toward Megan\u2019s house, but he wasn\u2019t in the mood to go looking for a fight now, didn\u2019t want to go to Megan with blood on his hands. Besides, as far as he knew, the hunter wasn\u2019t doing much hunting.</p><p>He pushed all thoughts of Villagrande and the Vampire Council from his mind as he pulled into Megan\u2019s driveway. The next few hours belonged to him.</p><p>Filled with anticipation, he knocked on the door, felt his whole body spring to attention when she opened it wearing nothing but a smile.</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>Rhys slid his arm around Megan\u2019s shoulders. It was late Saturday night, and they were sitting on the sofa in her living room. The fragrance of her hair and skin surrounded him, the scent of her blood drugged his senses.</p><p>He nuzzled the side of her neck, thinking how much his life had changed since that first night when he had walked into Shore\u2019s. Sometimes, he almost forgot who and what he was. Sometimes he felt almost human again.</p><p>Two weeks had passed since Megan had met him at the door wearing nothing but a come-hither smile. They had been the best two weeks of his existence, which was saying something, he thought, considering his longevity. He continued to meet Megan at Shore\u2019s when she got off work. On her days off, he spent his nights in her company. Sometimes they went dancing at his club; other nights they went to the movies, or spent the evening at his place, curled up in each other\u2019s arms. Last weekend, they had gone out with Shirl and her boyfriend. Rhys had been somewhat surprised that Shirl had agreed. It was obvious she didn\u2019t trust him.</p><p>But that didn\u2019t matter now. Nothing mattered but the woman in his arms. It wasn\u2019t easy, dating a mortal. She was so fragile, he had to be on guard every minute to make sure he didn\u2019t hurt her, to keep his supernatural strength carefully under wraps. But it had been worth it. He had been on his best behavior the last two weeks and had finally managed to put the last of her doubts and fears to rest. Of course, he always fed before going to her house. There was nothing more obvious than a hungry vampire. He had seen a few in his time, and it was never a pretty sight. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His existence would have been perfect, Rhys mused, if not for the new hunter in town, and the rogue vampire who was slowly making his way toward the West Coast, pint by pint, and body by body. He hadn\u2019t heard of any more vampire killings in the last week. Did that mean the rogue had finally had his fill? Or did that new hunter in town have something to do with it?</p><p>\u201cRhys?\u201d Megan tapped his forehead lightly. \u201cHey, Rhys? You in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh, sorry. I was just thinking about some club business.\u201d He didn\u2019t like lying to her, but he could hardly tell her the truth.</p> <p>\u201cIt is anything you want to talk about?\u201d Megan asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He stroked her cheek with his fingertips. \u201cWhen we\u2019re together, I don\u2019t want to think about anything but you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop thinking,\u201d she murmured, \u201cand kiss me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure, as always,\u201d he replied, and claimed her lips with his.</p><p>Megan was standing on the front porch with Rhys later that night when Shirl came home from a date with Greg.</p> <p>Shirl was humming the first few notes of the wedding march as she skipped up the stairs. A nod at Rhys, a wink at Megan, and Shirl went inside and closed the door, giving Megan and Rhys some privacy.</p><p>Love was in the air, Megan thought. She hadn\u2019t seen her roommate looking so happy in a long time. It was obvious from the glow in Shirl\u2019s eyes that she was in love with Greg. Megan grinned inwardly, wondering if people could tell just by looking at her that she, too, was in love.</p><p>Rhys waited until Shirl closed the door, then pulled Megan into his arms. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow night,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Megan closed her eyes as his lips touched hers in a long, slow kiss that made her knees weak and her toes curl.</p><p>Another quick kiss, a wave, and he got in his car and roared off into the darkness.</p><p>Megan was smiling when she walked into the living room.</p> <p>\u201cThings seem to be going hot and heavy between the two of you,\u201d Shirl remarked. After kicking off her shoes, she flopped down on the sofa, and looked up at Megan, one eyebrow raised.</p><p>Megan tucked a lock of hair behind her ear. Hot and heavy didn\u2019t begin to describe it, she thought, as she curled up on the other end of the sofa.</p><p>\u201cNo more doubts about him?\u201d Shirl asked.</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d Megan replied, though that wasn\u2019t exactly true. \u201cIt\u2019s just that a lot of little things bother me, like the way his eyes sometimes glow red, and the way he sometimes seems to just fade into the darkness.\u201d But none of that seemed important when she was with Rhys.</p><p>Shirl toyed with a lock of her hair, her expression thoughtful. \u201cDoesn\u2019t it seem strange to you that you never see him during the day, and that every time we offer him something to eat, he refuses?\u201d</p><p>Megan shook her head. Rhys had a nightclub to run; she assumed that it kept him busy during the day. As for his not having dinner with her, the few times she had invited him, he had always had a valid excuse. Still...\u201cWhat are you getting at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wears a lot of black.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello? He runs a Goth club, remember? Besides, it looks good on him.\u201d And even as she said the words, she remembered standing in Shore\u2019s parking lot and thinking that Rhys looked like the night, because he was the night. The memory sent a shiver down her spine. \u201cShirl, just what are you trying to say?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll laugh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if I really believed in such things, I\u2019d say he was a vampire.\u201d</p><p>Megan stared at her a moment. \u201cA vampire? Are you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said it yourself. His eyes turn red. He sort of disappears into the night.\u201d Shirl made a dismissive gesture with one hand. \u201cYou know me, I\u2019m always looking for the real thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you say, but I remember how fast you dumped that guy who wanted to drink your blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsaac, yeah,\u201d Shirl said. \u201cWell, I never told you this, but he didn\u2019t just want to drink my blood. He wanted to cut me with a razor and let the blood drip into a silver goblet. It was just too creepy.\u201d Closing her eyes, she rubbed her temples.</p><p>\u201cAnother headache?\u201d Megan asked.</p><p>\u201cJust a little one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as vampires, girlfriend, but those headaches are real. I wish you\u2019d go to the doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNag, nag, nag. You\u2019re worse than my mother. Stop worrying, will ya? And as for vampires, haven\u2019t you been listening to the news? They\u2019re finding bodies drained of blood from one end of the country to the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t believe what you hear on the news, you know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not,\u201d Shirl said. \u201cBut they showed a picture of the last victim. You might not want to believe what you read, but it\u2019s pretty hard to ignore a dead body. And on that happy note, I\u2019m going to bed.\u201d Rising, she picked up her shoes. \u201cI\u2019ll probably be gone when you get up in the morning. Greg\u2019s taking me fishing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFishing? Since when do you like to fish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince Greg asked me to go with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave fun,\u201d Megan said, grinning as she tried to imagine Shirl baiting a hook.</p><p>\u201cAh, the things I do for love,\u201d Shirl exclaimed dramatically. \u201cNight, Meggie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>Megan went up to bed a few minutes later. Lying there in the dark, she thought about what Shirl had said, then laughed softly. Vampires, indeed.</p><p>Sunday night, Megan convinced Rhys to go to one of the free concerts in Griffith Park. She had wanted to sit up front, near the band, but Rhys persuaded her to sit near the back. He told her it was so he could kiss her without an audience, but that was only a part of the truth. Being in the midst of hundreds of people played havoc with his self-control.</p><p>Sitting on a blanket, with Megan cradled between his thighs, his arms around her waist, he could pretend he was no different from any other man. His desire sparked to life when she shifted in his embrace. He nuzzled the back of her neck, his senses filling with her unique scent, making it easy to ignore everyone else. She moaned softly when he nipped at the smooth skin beneath her ear lobe, her soft sigh of pleasure stirring other hungers best left unfed. And yet the scent of her blood, the steady beat of her heart, all called to the beast within, urging him to drag her into the shadows and satisfy both of his hungers. His arm tightened around her waist, imprisoning her as the urge to feed grew stronger.</p><p>\u201cRhys?\u201d She glanced at him over her shoulder. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he replied, his voice rough. \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hurting me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Muttering an oath, he relaxed his hold on her and leaned back, putting some space between them. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>Megan frowned. Why was it that, every now and then, his eyes took on that reddish hue? Was it a trick of the colored lights playing over the park? But what about when they were alone and there were no lights?</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy? Are you?\u201d</p><p>He was more than ready to leave. So many people, all sitting close together, so many beating hearts...He had thought if he put some distance between himself and the crowd, it would help, but it hadn\u2019t. And then there was Megan, her body pressed close to his. A constant temptation.</p><p>He took a deep, calming breath. \u201cWe can stay if you want.\u201d Leaning forward, he brushed a kiss across her cheek. \u201cI just need to stretch my legs. I\u2019ll be back in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>Before she could ask any questions, he stood and melted into the shadows. The area away from the concert was dark; there were no paths, lights were few.</p><p>He had been kidding himself, he mused, as he put the crowd behind him. There was no way on earth that he and Megan could have a life together. The only reason the relationship between Delacourt and Daisy had lasted was because Daisy had accepted the Dark Gift. Rhys hadn\u2019t known Megan long, but he was pretty sure she would reject the idea of becoming a vampire out of hand.</p><p>He was about to return to the concert area when he became aware of two things simultaneously. Megan had followed him, and the hunter was right behind him. Rhys swore softly. If he met his end tonight, it would be his own damn fault. He had been so busy thinking about things that could never be, he had let his guard down.</p><p>Fangs bared, he whirled around and came face-to-face with a big bear of a man who brandished a nasty-looking pistol in one gloved hand, and a large wooden stake in the other.</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>Megan stared, uncomprehending, at the scene before her. She looked at Rhys, but it was a Rhys she had never seen before. His body was taut and even from a distance, she could feel the power rolling off him. When he glanced her way, his eyes blazed red. She closed her eyes a moment and then looked again. His eyes were still red. It was no trick of the light this time.</p><p>The man standing across from Rhys was huge. He was dressed in black from his hat to his shoes. Megan took a step forward, her eyes narrowing. Was he holding a gun? And a wooden stake?</p><p>The man moved toward Rhys. And Rhys snarled at him, revealing...Megan blinked at him, and blinked again. Fangs?</p><p>She was dreaming, she thought, she had to be dreaming.</p><p>Without taking his gaze from the other man, Rhys shouted. \u201cMegan, get the hell out of here! Now!\u201d</p><p>Before she had time to think or respond, the man in black fired the gun. Rhys doubled over, hissing through clenched teeth as his hands pressed against his stomach.</p><p>The man in black lunged forward, the stake raised in his right hand. A low cry rose in his throat as he plunged the stake into Rhys\u2019s back. She watched in horror as Rhys slowly sank to the ground and toppled onto his side, his hands still pressed to his stomach. In the dim light, the blood leaking through his fingers looked black.</p><p>What to do, Megan thought frantically. She took a step forward, driven by her need to go to Rhys, to offer aid, comfort, something, but before she could clear her mind, the man turned toward her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Fear for her own life sent Megan running back toward the concert area. Safety in numbers, she thought frantically, even as she tried to block the horrific scene from her mind. But the carnage played over and over again, each time more chilling than the last.</p><p>A police officer stood on the edge of the crowd. Gasping for breath, Megan hurried toward him. Her mother had always told her to look for a cop if she was in trouble. And she was definitely in trouble.</p><p>\u201cOfficer!\u201d</p> <p>He looked up as she came running toward him. \u201cCan I help you, miss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! My...my boyfriend and I had a fight, and I don\u2019t have any way to get home and I\u2019m afraid....\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he still here?\u201d the officer asked, glancing behind Megan. \u201cDid he hurt you? Threaten you in any way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOver there.\u201d She gestured toward the deserted section of the park. \u201cStay here until I get back.\u201d He pulled a flashlight from his belt and ran back the way Megan had come.</p><p>Megan stared after him. Had she done the right thing? What if the man who had killed Rhys killed the police officer, too? It would be her fault. Lordy, what if the killer came after her? She had witnessed his crime.</p><p>Grabbing her cell phone from her pocket, she punched in Shirl\u2019s number.</p><p>Shirl answered on the second ring.</p><p>\u201cHey, Megan, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShirl, I need you to come and pick me up. Hurry, please!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t talk now. I\u2019m at the concert area of the park.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>The police officer returned moments after Megan ended the call. \u201cThere\u2019s no sign of him,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you want to file a report?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I just want to go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there someone you can call?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, thank you. I\u2019m sorry to have bothered you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo bother at all,\u201d he said with a smile.</p> <p>It took twenty minutes for Shirl to get to the park. They were the longest twenty minutes of Megan\u2019s life. Why hadn\u2019t the policeman found anything, she wondered, and then answered her own question. The killer had probably taken Rhys\u2019s body away.</p><p>After climbing inside Shirl\u2019s car, Megan locked the passenger door, then huddled against the seat, her arms wrapped around her waist, shivering.</p><p>\u201cGirl, what did that man do to you?\u201d Shirl asked. \u201cYou\u2019re white as a ghost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were right,\u201d Megan whispered. \u201cYou were right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? About what?\u201d Shirl asked.</p><p>\u201cRhys. He\u2019s...\u201d She couldn\u2019t say the word out loud. Doing so would make it real, and it couldn\u2019t be real. And yet there was no denying the proof of her own eyes.</p><p>\u201cMeggie, you\u2019re scaring me. What did he do to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now. Can\u2019t you drive faster?\u201d</p><p>It seemed to take forever to reach home. Megan glanced out the back window before getting out of the car, racing up to the porch, and unlocking the door. \u201cHurry, Shirl!\u201d</p><p>Once her friend was inside, Megan locked and bolted the door, then ran through the house, making sure the windows were locked, closing all the curtains.</p><p>Looking worried, Shirl followed her from room to room. \u201cMegan, if you don\u2019t tell me what\u2019s going on right this instant, I\u2019m going to...to...I don\u2019t know what!\u201d</p><p>When she was sure the house was secure, Megan returned to the living room and curled up on the sofa. She couldn\u2019t stop shaking.</p><p>\u201cMeggie, what\u2019s wrong? What did he do? Should I call the police?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were right.\u201d Megan stared up at her friend. \u201cYou were right about him. He\u2019s...\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cHe is a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me.\u201d She couldn\u2019t say it again.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think he\u2019s one of the Undead? What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were at the concert. He said he needed to go for a walk and I...I followed him. I saw him and another man. They were staring at each other, almost like they were sizing each other up. The other man had a gun and a wooden stake. I must have made a noise, because Rhys turned and looked at me. His eyes, they were blood red, and he...he had fangs. He shouted for me to get out of there, but before I could move, the other man shot him.\u201d She shuddered with the memory. \u201cAnd then the man drove the stake into Rhys\u2019s back, and...Rhys collapsed.\u201d Sobbing, she buried her face in her hands. \u201cThe man looked at me, and I ran away.\u201d</p><p>How could she have been so cowardly? She should have stayed. She scrubbed her hands up and down her arms, trying to get warm. What if Rhys wasn\u2019t dead? What if he had needed help? She shook her head. What if he had? What kind of help could she have given him? She didn\u2019t know anything about fighting vampires or slayers. The other man had had a gun, for crying out loud. And Rhys had...She swallowed hard. Fangs. Sharp white fangs that had glistened in the moonlight. And what did she have? A set of acrylic nails.</p><p>Shirl turned on the heater and lit a fire in the hearth, then sat beside Megan. \u201cCalm down, sweetie. You\u2019re safe now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d What if that man had followed her home? Had she put Shirl\u2019s life in danger?</p><p>\u201cAre you sure about this, Meggie? I mean, geez, I was kidding when I said he was a vampire. I never thought it was true. Good grief, who knew such things really existed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he\u2019s not dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhether he is or isn\u2019t, there\u2019s nothing you could have done.\u201d</p><p>A burst of hysterical laughter rose in Megan\u2019s throat. Of course he was dead. She didn\u2019t know much about vampires, but she had seen enough horror movies to know that a wooden stake through the heart was foolproof. She had been right to run, she thought. If she had stayed, the man might have killed her, too. After all, she was the only witness. So, why did she still feel so guilty?</p><p>Shirl looked at her, eyes wide. \u201cMeggie, you don\u2019t think...I mean, if vampires are real, maybe there are were wolves and trolls and...and...who knows what else?\u201d She pressed a hand to her heart. \u201cI think I could use a drink! How about you?\u201d</p><p>Megan lay in her bed, the covers pulled up to her chin. Every time she closed her eyes, she saw Rhys clutching at his stomach, falling to the ground. All the booze in the world couldn\u2019t erase that image. Or change the fact that she had made love to a vampire.</p><p>She lifted a hand to her throat. Had he fed on her?</p><p>Vampire.</p><p>It explained everything.</p><p>And nothing.</p><p>She flopped over onto her stomach. She didn\u2019t know what to think, how to feel. All she knew was that there was a hole the size of the Grand Canyon in her heart that no one else would ever fill. Vampire or not, she had loved him.</p><p>Tears stung her eyes. She had loved him, and now he was gone. It seemed odd to grieve for a man who had already died once, but she couldn\u2019t help it. Had he loved her, as well? Or had he only been using her for...what? Had he been planning to feed on her? He could have done that at any time. To turn her into what he was? She recoiled at the thought.</p><p>Unable to sleep, she got out of bed, pulled on her robe, and went downstairs. After turning on the light in the room they used for an office, she booted up the computer and did a Google search for vampires. There were hundreds of sites. Every civilization in the world, both ancient and modern, had its own vampire myths and legends. Transylvania had turned the Dracula legend into a lucrative business.</p><p>Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of movies had been made about vampires, everything from horror flicks to comedies and cartoons.</p><p>And then there were the Goths\u2014men and women who emulated the vampire lifestyle. They dressed in black, wore black contact lenses, and sported fake fangs. The women wore black or blood-red lipstick, and decorated their homes in the Victorian manner. Red wine was the drink of choice, although there were some who\u2014gag!\u2014drank blood from willing donors.</p><p>Megan shuddered at the mere idea.</p><p>Reading on, she learned that many people were introduced to vampires by way of the role-playing game, \u201cVampire: the Masquerade.\u201d</p><p>Psychic vampires fed on energy\u2014some fed during sex, others by mingling with large crowds of people, while still others fed on nature itself. Then there were psychotic vampires who were believed to have some kind of sociopathic mental illness that caused them to behave in bizarre fashion. Megan grimaced as she read about Elizabeth Bathory. Elizabeth had been a countess back in the 1500s. It was generally accepted that she had been a psychotic vampire. Beautiful and vain, Elizabeth had tortured and killed hundreds of young girls, then bathed in their blood, believing that doing so would keep her forever young.</p><p>Inevitably, one of the sites listed ways to destroy a vampire. A stake through the heart was high on the list. Reading the words made Megan\u2019s stomach churn, but she forced herself to keep reading. After all, if there was one vampire, there might be more.</p><p>Another sure way to dispatch a vampire was by beheading, or exposing the creature to sunlight. Garlic and crosses were supposed to repel them. Holy water and silver burned their flesh. A small footnote mentioned that there could be only one Master Vampire in any given territory at one time.</p><p>Megan sat back in her chair, her mind reeling, her eyes gritty from lack of sleep. She needed to go to bed, yet how could she expect to sleep now? She had no doubt that Rhys was\u2014she blinked back her tears\u2014had been...a vampire. She had seen his eyes glowing red, seen his fangs. He didn\u2019t eat; she had never seen him during the day. In all the times he had come to Shore\u2019s, he had never once looked in a mirror. Now that she thought about it, he had gone out of his way to avoid them.</p><p>Vampire. Nosferatu. Undead creature of the night.</p><p>The tears came then. Rocking back and forth, she wept for Rhys and for the burgeoning love that had died with him.</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>Rhys pressed one hand over the ragged wound in his belly. Though his body had cast off the silver slug, it had burned like fire going in and coming out. Dark red blood dripped through his fingers as he stared at the body of the hunter sprawled facedown on the grass. He didn\u2019t know how the man had found him. Dumb luck, he supposed. Or maybe the hunter had been tracking him, although Rhys thought it unlikely. He might have been preoccupied with Megan the last few weeks, but he hadn\u2019t gone deaf, dumb, and blind. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Until tonight.</p><p>It had taken what little strength he had left to veil his presence and that of the hunter from the police officer who\u2019d been snooping around earlier. Rhys had no doubt that Megan had sent the cop. Whether she wanted the officer to help him, or make sure he was dead, was anybody\u2019s guess. One thing he knew for sure, she had been terrified by what she\u2019d seen, but he could hardly blame her for that.</p><p>He winced as he explored the wound in his back. This was the second time someone had staked him and missed his heart by inches, he mused. First Daisy, and now this hunter. If he wasn\u2019t careful, his luck was going to run out.</p> <p>Rhys swore softly as the scent of the hunter\u2019s blood drifted on the breeze. He needed blood to heal the wounds the bastard had inflicted, but drinking from the dead, even the newly dead, was distasteful.</p><p>But there was fresh prey nearby. Moving through the shadows, he found a couple of teenaged boys sitting off by themselves, sharing a joint.</p><p>They looked up when they saw him, their expressions showing first surprise and then fear as he drew closer. Fear that turned to terror when they realized they couldn\u2019t speak, couldn\u2019t move.</p><p>Rhys took what he needed, wiped the memory of what had happened from their minds, then slipped into the shadows, enjoying a mild high from the drug in their blood.</p><p>He had to see Megan. Even knowing that she would recoil from his presence, he had to see her again. She knew him for what he was now, and the knowledge had horrified her. He had seen the revulsion in her eyes before she fled the scene. Not that he blamed her for taking off. Hadn\u2019t he told her to go? Of course, she was a smart girl, and, considering what she had seen, she likely would have run anyway.</p> <p>A thought took him to her house, another to her bedside.</p><p>She slept with a light on. After what she had been through that night, he wasn\u2019t surprised. For a moment, he could only stand there, thinking how beautiful she was, her red gold hair as soft as silk, her skin the color of rich cream, her lips, pink and perfect and slightly parted.</p><p>Curious to know what she dreamed of, he let his mind brush hers.</p><p>She was dreaming that they were walking along the beach arm in arm. In her dream, he wasn\u2019t a vampire.</p><p>\u201cMegan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRhys?\u201d Still caught up in her dream, she smiled\u2014until she opened her eyes and saw him standing beside the bed. Suddenly wide awake, she bolted upright, the sheet clutched to her breasts as if it would protect her, the smile on her face fading, the color draining from her cheeks. \u201cHow can you be here? I thought...that man...he shot you. I saw him drive a stake into your back.\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged. \u201cAs you can see, I\u2019m fine.\u201d He clenched his hands at his sides. He could hear her heart beating wildly, taste the fear that tainted her skin. \u201cDammit, stop looking at me like that!\u201d</p><p>His anger stoked her own. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m scared, but what do you expect? It\u2019s not every day I see a man killed in front of me. Almost killed.\u201d She made a vague gesture with her hand. \u201cWhatever! Why didn\u2019t you tell me what you were? What you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe because I didn\u2019t want to see that look in your eyes.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze slid away from his.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve nothing to fear from me,\u201d he said, his voice gruff. \u201cI only came to make certain you were all right.\u201d</p><p>Still not looking at him, she murmured, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I ran away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you have to be sorry about? I told you to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have stayed.\u201d</p> <p>He laughed softly. \u201cAnd done what?\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him then, her gaze meeting his. \u201cWhat did you do to that man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust exactly what you think I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou killed him.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question. \u201cDid you...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She looked surprised. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer it warm.\u201d His gaze moved to the hollow of her throat. \u201cAnd fresh.\u201d</p><p>If possible, her face went even paler.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t bother you anymore. I just came by to make sure you got home all right. Good-bye, Megan.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t wait for her to reply. Calling on his preternatural power, he vanished from her sight.</p><p>For a moment, he stood on the sidewalk below her window. She was lost to him now, that was for damn sure. He tried to comfort himself with the thought that it was just as well, and failed miserably. He had never intended to fall in love with her. Perhaps he should have told her the truth, he thought, and then shook his head. Had he done so, he would have just lost her sooner. His one regret was that she had seen him at his worst.</p><p>One regret, he thought bleakly. Hell, he had a million of them.</p><p>Muttering an oath, he went in search of prey.</p><p>Chapter 21</p><p>Megan spent Monday morning curled up on the sofa. She felt numb inside, as if her body had lost the ability to feel. She had no appetite, no desire to get dressed. No desire to do anything. Shirl had offered to stay home from work, but Megan had said thanks, but no thanks. All she wanted was to be alone with her grief. Rhys was alive, she thought, and let out a harsh laugh. Not alive, but Undead. Either way, he was lost to her.</p><p>She replayed his last visit over and over again, wishing it had ended differently, wishing...what? That she had asked him to stay? That she had told him his being a vampire didn\u2019t matter? If only it didn\u2019t!</p><p>She blinked back her tears. How could she have fallen in love with a vampire? Let him kiss her? Make love to her? How could she not have known what he was? Maybe she had. Maybe her initial fear and distrust had been some innate sense of self-preservation, a warning she had refused to heed. But honestly, who knew vampires were real? Sure, in the last few weeks there had been stories on the nightly news that hinted at such things, but no one took such stories seriously. You couldn\u2019t believe everything you heard on the news. Vampires terrorizing New York and Los Angeles? Yeah, right. Who could worry about mythical creatures when there were so many real monsters roaming the streets, gunning down innocent women and children, kidnapping college kids while they were on spring break, raping children.</p><p>Heartsick and depressed, she slept most of the day away. But there was no escaping Rhys in her dreams, either...</p><p>He came to her, an apparition dressed all in black, his dark blond hair glowing like a halo in the darkness. His voice whispered over her skin like a caress.</p><p>\u201cMegan.\u201d Just her name, filled with such longing it brought quick tears to her eyes.</p><p>\u201cRhys. I wish...\u201d</p><p>He covered her mouth with his hand. \u201cDon\u2019t say it. I can\u2019t change what I am. I can\u2019t give you the life you deserve. I only wanted to make love to you one last time.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThis isn\u2019t real.\u201d</p><p>His gaze burned into hers. \u201cIt\u2019s as real as you want it to be.\u201d</p><p>And because she wanted to hold him, love him, she closed her eyes and surrendered to his touch. His hands glided over her body, each stroke a symphony played by a master musician. She clung to him, wanting to be closer, closer, to believe it was more than a dream.</p><p>She shivered when his tongue slid along the tender flesh below her ear, moaned softly as his teeth grazed her skin.</p><p>He was biting her! For one endless moment of time, she gave herself up to the sensual pleasure of it. It was, after all, only a dream.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>As from far away, she heard Shirl calling her name.</p><p>With a start, Megan opened her eyes, her heart pounding, her body warm and tingling from his touch.</p><p>Jumping off the sofa, she ran into the bathroom. Holding her hair away from her neck, she turned her head to the side and looked in the mirror, her stomach knotting when she saw the truth reflected in the mirror.</p><p>There, on the left side of her neck, two tiny bites and a single drop of blood.</p><p>\u201cIt had to be a dream,\u201d Shirl said.</p><p>They were sitting at the kitchen table, eating the Chinese takeout Shirl had brought home for dinner.</p><p>Megan pointed at the bites on her neck. \u201cDo these look like a dream to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Shirl leaned forward. \u201cI don\u2019t see anything.\u201d</p><p>Megan frowned. \u201cThere were two bites there just a few minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m sure.\u201d Jumping to her feet, Megan ran into the bathroom and stood in front of the mirror. She turned her head this way and that, but her skin was smooth and unblemished.</p><p>Frowning, Megan went back into the kitchen and resumed her seat. \u201cI was so sure....\u201d She shook her head. Maybe it had been a dream. But what if it wasn\u2019t? \u201cOkay, so I imagined the whole thing. You\u2019re the vampire expert. How can I keep him out of the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, according to lore, you have to rescind your invitation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do I do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to say that you take it back, that he\u2019s not welcome here anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I have to say it to his face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. Just do it.\u201d</p><p>Feeling a little foolish, Megan said, \u201cRhys Costain, I revoke my invitation. You are no longer welcome in my home.\u201d Was it her imagination, or did the house seem to sigh? \u201cHow do we know if it worked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Shirl said, shrugging. \u201cWait and see, I guess.\u201d</p><p>It took all the energy Megan possessed to get up and get ready for work Tuesday night. She didn\u2019t want to go to Shore\u2019s, but she didn\u2019t want to spend another day curled up on the sofa, brooding, either.</p><p>Because it suited her mood, she wore a black sheath to work. Black was the color of mourning, after all.</p><p>And of vampires...</p><p>She shook the thought from her mind. She would not think of him.</p><p>She was surprised when Drexel came into the shop shortly after ten.</p><p>\u201cHey, babe,\u201d he said. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing all right. I\u2019m sorry about Kenny. I know how close the two of you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Ken was with me when we first started.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cBest songwriter I ever knew. We\u2019re gonna miss him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow about you?\u201d she asked. \u201cNo ill effects from the fire?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cMy throat was sore for a few days. Nothing major.\u201d He lifted his arm, which was bandaged from elbow to wrist. \u201cThe burn turned out to be worse than they first thought. Doc says I\u2019ll probably have a nasty scar.\u201d A muscle twitched in his jaw. \u201cBut it could have been worse. Anyway, I came by hoping that dude who was with you might be here. I want to thank him for getting me on that ambulance when he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, he\u2019s not here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, give him my thanks when you see him, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d She blinked away the tears scorching the backs of her eyes. \u201cCan I show you anything tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust your gorgeous self,\u201d he said with a wink.</p><p>Megan shook her head. \u201cTake care of yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too, babe. My proposal still stands, anytime you want to say yes.\u201d</p> <p>For one mad, crazy moment, she was tempted to accept. Why not? Rhys was gone, and she was tired of being alone. Drexel was cute; he was rich; he was famous. If she married him, she could have anything her heart desired\u2014houses, luxury cars, expensive clothes and jewelry. Anything she wanted. Except the man she loved.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going on tour day after tomorrow, but I\u2019ll stop in when I get back.\u201d Leaning forward, Drexel kissed her cheek. \u201cSee you soon, babe.\u201d</p><p>With a farewell wave to Mr. Parker, Drexel left the store.</p><p>Megan stared after him. She had always been fond of him, but there was a subtle difference in their relationship now, born of the fact that they had shared and survived a terrifying experience.</p><p>The rest of the night crawled by. Megan waited on several customers, but she felt as though she was moving through quicksand, as if time itself had altered somehow since that night in the park.</p><p>She was grieving for Rhys as if he had passed away, she thought, or maybe she was mourning the loss of their relationship. But she\u2019d get over it.</p> <p>\u201cAre you all right, Megan?\u201d Mr. Parker asked, coming up beside her.</p><p>She nodded. It wouldn\u2019t be easy, but her heart would heal, in time.</p><p>Rhys stood outside of Shore\u2019s, his presence cloaked from passersby as he gazed through the window, watching Megan move about the store.</p><p>He had tried to stay away, told himself they were both better off. In spite of the lies he had told himself, he had known from the beginning that, sooner or later, she would discover what he was and that knowledge would put an end to their relationship. He just hadn\u2019t expected it to happen so soon, or to hurt so damn bad.</p><p>He stared at her, hungering for her like a starving man deprived of food. He could smell the enticing scent of her hair and skin, hear the siren call of her heartbeat. He felt her lingering horror at discovering what he was, her feelings of confusion and betrayal. He had known she would never be able to accept the truth, yet the knowledge aroused his anger. Damn her! It wasn\u2019t his fault he had been turned into a monster. He understood her feelings, knew she had every right to be afraid of him, to be repulsed by what he was, but it did nothing to ease his anger. He could have drained her dry, turned her, killed her, but all he had done was love her. And he had thought she loved him.</p><p>She loved the man, taunted a little voice in the back of his mind. No woman could love the monster.</p><p>Hadn\u2019t he learned that lesson centuries ago from Josette? He would be wise to remember it in the future.</p><p>For the first time in his long existence, he hated what he was. Monster. There was no escaping it, no point in trying to be anything else.</p> <p>\u201cVampire!\u201d The word hissed between his teeth as he spun away from the window. Driven by a rage that would not be contained, a hunger that would not be denied, he fled into the darkness.</p><p>Chapter 22</p><p>Tom\u00e1s Villagrande strolled down Hollywood Boulevard, bemused by the steady stream of humanity that hurried by, never knowing there was a killer in their midst. The scent of their blood was intoxicating. For a moment, he was tempted to throw off the thin veneer of humanity he wore and let them see him for what he was. He could terrorize the puny mortals around him like a wolf raiding a flock of sheep. He could make a game of it, see how many he could drain in, say, ten minutes.</p><p>Somewhat reluctantly, he shook the thought away. Perhaps another night. For now, he wanted to explore the city. Costain resided here. According to vampire etiquette, Tom\u00e1s knew he should make his presence known to the Master of the West Coast Vampires, and perhaps he would, at some later date. But for now, he kept his presence cloaked, and he would continue to do so until he knew the lay of the land.</p><p>And so he continued to stroll along the sidewalk. How times had changed, he thought. In his day, decent women had dressed demurely and never ventured outside without a chaperone. True, women had bared a great deal of cleavage, but little more. Only the lightskirts had flashed so much skin, behaved so brazenly. A gaggle of teenage girls went by, cell phones pressed to their ears, their rounded arms and flat bellies bared to his gaze, their shorts barely covering their nicely curved bottoms. It made his mouth water just to look at them.</p><p>A couple of teenage boys cruised the boulevard in a silver convertible with the top down, music blaring from the car\u2019s speakers.</p><p>Across the street, a man dressed as a woman waited for the light to change. Farther down the street, Tom\u00e1s saw a woman dressed as a man. Insanity, he thought. What was the world coming to?</p><p>With a rueful shake of his head, he continued to stroll along the city streets, enjoying the cool kiss of the night air, the faint scent of the sea carried to him by an errant breeze.</p><p>And then, as he approached a tall, glass-fronted building, he caught the distinct scent of vampire.</p><p>Chapter 23</p><p>Megan yawned behind her hand as she laid out a new shipment of Armani dress shirts. She had been miserable the last few days, and it was all because of Rhys. Even when she managed to keep him out of her head during the day, he haunted her dreams at night.</p><p>She had just finished ringing up a sale for one of her clients when Mr. Parker came out of his office, his expression grim.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSome man named Greg is on the phone for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreg?\u201d Why on earth would he be calling her at work? \u201cDid he say what he wanted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019d better talk to him.\u201d</p><p>A sudden coldness gripped Megan as she hurried into the office and picked up the phone. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMegan, it\u2019s Greg. I\u2019m at Mercy Arms Hospital with Shirl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hospital! Good Lord, is she...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s unconscious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened? Were you in an accident?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we went out dancing after dinner. She said she wasn\u2019t feeling well, and we decided to come home early. I\u2019d just turned off the freeway when she collapsed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Parker appeared in the doorway when she got off the phone. \u201cBad news?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy roommate, she\u2019s in the hospital,\u201d Megan said, grabbing her coat and her handbag. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI hope she\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will be,\u201d Megan said. She refused to think otherwise.</p><p>She made it to the hospital in record time.</p><p>Shirl was in a private room on the third floor. Greg looked up when Megan entered the room. It was easy to see from the look on his face that their relationship was a lot more serious than Shirl had let on.</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d Megan asked, hurrying to Shirl\u2019s bedside.</p><p>\u201cAbout the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does the doctor say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much at the moment. We\u2019re waiting for the results of some tests.\u201d</p><p>Megan took Shirl\u2019s hand in hers. Even unconscious, her face almost as pale as the pillowcase, Shirl looked beautiful. \u201cShe\u2019s always been so healthy.\u201d Megan looked across the bed at Greg. \u201cExcept for her headaches...\u201d Her breath caught in her throat. \u201cYou don\u2019t think...\u201d Megan couldn\u2019t finish the sentence.</p><p>Feeling suddenly weak, she dropped into the chair beside the bed. All those headaches...In the movies, it always meant something awful, like cancer or a brain tumor. Fear congealed in the pit of her stomach.</p><p>She looked at Greg, seeking hope, but judging from the bleak expression on his face, he was entertaining some pretty morbid thoughts of his own.</p><p>She was surprised that no one told them to leave. Nurses came and went all through the night, their rubber-soled shoes making little or no sound as they took Shirl\u2019s vitals, her blood, changed the IV.</p><p>It was near four A.M. when Megan came awake with a start. For a moment, she forgot where she was, but only a moment. The distinct smell of disinfectant reminded her that she was in the hospital. Blinking the sleep from her eyes, she glanced around the room. Greg slept in the other chair, snoring softly.</p><p>Ignoring the ache in her back and shoulders caused by sleeping in a hard plastic chair, Megan rose. She smiled when she saw that Shirl was awake. \u201cHey, girl, how do you feel? Can I get you anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can get me out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, as soon as the doctors say you can leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Meggie, now, today.\u201d Shirl grabbed Megan\u2019s hand so hard Megan feared the bones might break. \u201cMegan, please get me out of here. I don\u2019t want to die in this place, hooked up to a bunch of machines, tubes everywhere!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShirl, calm down. You\u2019re not going to die.\u201d As gently as she could, she pulled her hand away, then took both of Shirl\u2019s hands in hers. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Shirl lifted a hand to her head. \u201cI have a tumor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t know that,\u201d Megan said, forcing a note of calm into her voice that she was far from feeling. \u201cGreg said they\u2019re waiting for the test results.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Meggie. It\u2019s been there for a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Megan stared at her. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tears welled in Shirl\u2019s eyes and dripped, unchecked, down her cheeks. \u201cI\u2019ve known for over a year. It\u2019s what\u2019s causing my headaches. I never should have gotten involved with Greg.\u201d</p><p>Megan shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d</p><p>Shirl squeezed her hand again. \u201cI\u2019m afraid, Meggie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know. I know. There must be something they can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s inoperable.\u201d Shirl quickly dried her eyes on a corner of the sheet when Greg woke with a low groan.</p><p>Rising, he kissed her cheek. \u201cHey, beautiful, how are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter. I\u2019m going home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? But, the tests...the doctor...\u201d</p> <p>Shirl glanced at Megan. \u201cCould you leave us alone for a few minutes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Megan looked from Shirl to Greg. \u201cI\u2019ll be right outside.\u201d</p><p>Megan paced the hospital corridor, her mind refusing to believe that Shirl was dying. How could her friend have kept such a secret from her? It wasn\u2019t fair. Shirl was young and beautiful, at the top of her career, and in love for the first time in her life. Why had this happened to her?</p><p>When Megan reached the end of the corridor, she blinked away her tears, then started walking back toward Shirl\u2019s room. She bit down on her lower lip when Greg stalked out of the room and headed for the elevators.</p><p>Heaving a sigh, she went to offer Shirl what comfort she could.</p><p>In spite of what everyone, including her doctor had to say, Shirl insisted on checking out of the hospital.</p> <p>At home, Megan tucked Shirl into bed, made sure she was comfortable, and then went to her own room. After undressing, she went into the bathroom, stepped into the shower, and turned the water on full blast so Shirl wouldn\u2019t hear her crying. Shirl was more than her roommate; she was the sister Megan had always wanted.</p><p>Megan stayed in the shower until she had no tears left. After drying off, she pulled on a pair of sweats and went downstairs to fix blueberry waffles for breakfast. She put the plates on a pretty tray and carried it upstairs, only to find that neither of them had any appetite.</p><p>Megan set her plate on top of Shirl\u2019s on the nightstand. \u201cDo your parents know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Megan stared out the window, trying to imagine what it would be like to know your only child was dying. Was Shirl\u2019s mother remembering what Shirl had been like as a little girl, regretting the fact that she hadn\u2019t been a better mother, that they hadn\u2019t spent more time together?</p><p>\u201cI broke it off with Greg,\u201d Shirl said, her voice barely audible. \u201cHe said it didn\u2019t matter, that he wanted to stay with me, but it\u2019s for the best.\u201d</p><p>Megan nodded. What did you say to someone whose time was running out? Everything she thought of sounded trite or silly. Instead, she found herself remembering late night pillow fights and all the times they had shared confidences over a cup of hot chocolate. She was going to miss those times, Megan thought, blinking back her tears.</p><p>Silence hung heavy in the room for several minutes before Shirl said, \u201cMeggie, will you do something for me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course. Anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you get in touch with Rhys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRhys? Whatever for?\u201d Megan asked, and then, as comprehension dawned, she shook her head. \u201cNo, Shirl, don\u2019t even think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the only one who can help me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShirl...there has to be another option. Maybe another doctor would give you a better prognosis. At least get a second opinion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve gone to three different specialists, Meggie. They all say the same thing. It\u2019s inoperable.\u201d</p><p>Megan sighed. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be what he is, Shirl. Believe me, I\u2019ve seen it. It\u2019s not a pretty sight.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI watched him attack a man. I saw him with his mask down, his eyes red and glowing, his fangs stained with blood....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t want to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink of what you\u2019re saying, what you\u2019ll be giving up...\u201d Megan bit down on her lower lip as she realized the futility of that argument.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m giving up death for a new life,\u201d Shirl said. \u201cMy mind\u2019s made up, Meggie. I\u2019ve been thinking about it ever since you told me Rhys is a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you won\u2019t do it, I\u2019ll just go to his club. I know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the reason you broke up with Greg, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Living with someone who\u2019s dying is one thing. Asking him to share his life with a vampire...I couldn\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to tell your parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll worry about it later. I wonder if it hurts\u2014becoming a vampire, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Megan said. Being bitten didn\u2019t hurt. In fact, it felt wonderful, but maybe it was different when you were being...what was the term? Turned?</p><p>\u201cSo, will you contact him for me?\u201d</p><p>Megan nodded. \u201cIf that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>Even though she didn\u2019t agree with Shirl\u2019s decision, Megan couldn\u2019t still the little shiver of excitement that curled in the pit of her stomach at the thought of seeing Rhys again.</p><p>Megan called Mr. Parker that afternoon to ask for the night off. He told her not to worry about it, asked how Shirl was feeling, said to be sure to let him know if there was anything he could do, and hung up.</p><p>Shirl slept most of the day, which left Megan with little to do except think about seeing Rhys again. She grew increasingly nervous as the hours went by, until, finally, it was time to get ready to go. She dressed with care, chiding herself for taking pains with her hair and makeup, but she couldn\u2019t help it. This would probably be the last time she saw him, and she wanted him to remember her at her best.</p><p>Shortly after sundown, she drove to Rhys\u2019s apartment, only to find that he wasn\u2019t home. Returning to her car, she sat there a moment, her fingertips tapping nervously on the steering wheel. Where else would he be? The nightclub, of course.</p><p>Her heart was pounding wildly by the time she pulled into the parking lot of La Morte Rouge. She sat behind the wheel a moment, willing her pulse to stop racing. Was she nervous at going into the club alone, she wondered as she opened the car door, or afraid of seeing Rhys again? Probably both, she decided as she stepped out of the car and locked the door behind her.</p><p>She glanced around as she walked toward the front of the building. The parking lot was nearly empty.</p><p>She hesitated at the entrance. From out here, the place looked closed. What if Rhys wasn\u2019t there? Only one way to find out, she thought, and knocked on the door.</p><p>It opened almost immediately, and she came face-to-face with the same man who had opened it when she\u2019d come here with Rhys. If he recognized her, it didn\u2019t show in his expression.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, miss, the club doesn\u2019t open for another hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see Mr. Costain.\u201d</p><p>He lifted one thick brow. \u201cIs he expecting you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I think he\u2019ll see me.\u201d</p><p>The man looked her over a moment, then said, \u201cOf course. Come in. Please wait here.\u201d</p><p>Standing just inside the door, Megan glanced around. The room was empty save for a red-headed woman seated at the piano, her fingers moving languidly over the keyboard.</p><p>The man returned a few minutes later. \u201cThis way, Miss DeLacey.\u201d</p><p>She wondered how he knew her name as she followed him across the floor and up a short flight of stairs. She hadn\u2019t given it, and Rhys didn\u2019t know she was coming.</p><p>Megan stared at the door in front of her, her heart pounding wildly with the sudden realization that The Red Death wasn\u2019t a Goth club at all. It was a hangout for the Undead.</p><p>She jumped when the door opened.</p><p>\u201cAre you coming in?\u201d Rhys asked. \u201cOr have you changed your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know I was out here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always know where you are.\u201d</p><p>Well, that was disconcerting, to say the least.</p><p>He took a step back. \u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>Feeling like Daniel going into the lion\u2019s den, Megan followed him into the room, which turned out to be a large office.</p><p>He gestured at an overstuffed chair upholstered in dark red velvet. \u201cSit down.\u201d</p><p>She sat, her gaze darting around the room. The walls were papered in a dark red and gold stripe, giving the room the look of an old-fashioned brothel. The floors were polished hardwood. A pair of antique oak filing cabinets stood against one wall. The chair behind the desk was black leather. There were no windows in the room. She thought the state-of-the-art computer and the chrome-and-glass desk looked out of place.</p><p>He sat in his chair, watching her, his face devoid of expression. She couldn\u2019t help noticing he was wearing one of the navy-blue pinstriped shirts he had bought from her.</p><p>She clasped her hands tightly in her lap to keep them from shaking.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he asked, \u201cwhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShirl wants to see you.\u201d</p><p>Megan felt a little thrill of satisfaction. He hadn\u2019t seen that coming.</p><p>\u201cIndeed? What for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wants to be a vampire.\u201d</p><p>Disbelief danced across his features, and then he laughed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Megan said. \u201cShe\u2019s dying.\u201d</p><p>His laughter stilled, and he leaned forward, his arms crossed on the desk. \u201cYou\u2019re serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course! I wouldn\u2019t make jokes about something like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I meant the part about her wanting to be a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s afraid to die.\u201d</p><p>He grunted softly. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has a tumor. In her brain. It\u2019s inoperable.\u201d</p><p>He leaned back in his chair, his elbows resting on the arms, his fingers steepled beneath his chin.</p><p>Megan forced herself to look at him. Forced herself, she thought ruefully. What a lie that was. She couldn\u2019t stop staring at him, couldn\u2019t stop remembering the touch of his hands, his lips, the way his body felt against hers. Couldn\u2019t stop wishing...She slammed the door on her thoughts. He was what he was, and there was no changing it, no wishing away the truth. She had lost him, just as surely as she was going to lose her best friend. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhen does she want to do it?\u201d Rhys asked.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t say. She wants to talk to you first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d He lowered his hands and leaned forward again. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean? I don\u2019t want anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t Shirl come here herself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause...I...because she\u2019s...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you come here?\u201d</p><p>There was no point in lying to him, so she didn\u2019t. \u201cBecause Shirl said she\u2019d come if I didn\u2019t, and she\u2019s sick.\u201d Megan lifted her chin. \u201cAnd because I wanted to see you again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh, the truth at last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t change anything,\u201d Megan said, rising swiftly to her feet. \u201cWhat should I tell Shirl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her I\u2019ll be there tomorrow night. What time is good for you?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cWhenever you can make it. I\u2019ll tell her to expect you. Good night.\u201d</p><p>He was around the desk in the blink of an eye, his arm snaking around her waist, his eyes smoldering with barely suppressed desire as he drew her body up against his.</p><p>\u201cNot so quick, my sweet, we haven\u2019t discussed my fee.\u201d</p> <p>She stared up at him. \u201cYour fee?\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cAre you kidding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want her to pay you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he replied in a voice that was silky smooth. \u201cI want you to pay me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe this!\u201d It had never occurred to her that vampires expected compensation for making other vampires. \u201cIsn\u2019t taking her blood and turning her into a monster payment enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Megan took a deep breath. She didn\u2019t have a lot of money saved. For that matter, neither did Shirl. \u201cHow much do you want?\u201d</p><p>His gaze swept across her lips. \u201cA kiss and a taste,\u201d he murmured. \u201cOne kiss, one taste, freely given.\u201d</p> <p>Revulsion and anticipation warred within her as she stared into his eyes. For Shirl, she thought. You can do this for Shirl.</p><p>\u201cStop lying to yourself,\u201d he said, a hint of anger in his voice. \u201cIt\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne kiss,\u201d she murmured. What could it hurt? Rising on her tiptoes, she pressed her lips to his.</p><p>He quickly took control of the kiss, his tongue sweeping across her lips, his mouth devouring hers as if he were a starving man and she his only hope of survival. She closed her eyes, her arms slipping around his waist, holding on for dear life as he deepened the kiss. A kiss that seemed to last forever, and ended all too soon.</p><p>For a moment, she couldn\u2019t breathe, couldn\u2019t think. She could only stand there, looking up at him, her heart aching for what was lost. And then, with a hand that trembled only a little, she pushed her hair behind her ear.</p><p>\u201cOne taste, freely given,\u201d she whispered tremulously, and closed her eyes.</p><p>He murmured her name, his tongue hot against her skin, unleashing a thrill of anticipation. She felt the gentle, teasing scrape of his fangs along the side of her neck, and then his bite, and then a rush of heat that left her gasping with sensual pleasure. Warmth spread through her whole body, settling deep in the core of her being. She pressed her body against his, driven by an almost desperate urge to be closer, to feel his skin against her own, to give him everything she had to give.</p><p>She was surprised by an unexpected spark of jealousy when she thought of Rhys\u2019s biting Shirl, giving her the same pleasure.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t stifle the soft moan that rose in her throat as he drank from her, or the soft cry of protest when he lifted his head.</p><p>Confused and on the verge of tears, she twisted out of his embrace and ran out of the office, a sharp stab of regret twisting her insides when he made no move to stop her.</p><p>Chapter 24</p><p>Shirl was asleep on the sofa, her cheek pillowed on her hand, when Megan returned home. For a moment, she stared down at her best friend, trying to imagine Shirl as a blood-sucking creature of the night, but she simply couldn\u2019t do it. Shirl hated the sight of blood, especially her own. She was afraid of the dark and slept with a night-light. Hardly vampire material.</p><p>With a sigh, Megan went upstairs to get ready for bed. In the bathroom, standing in front of the mirror, she tried to put herself in Shirl\u2019s place. What if she were dying? Would she grasp at a chance\u2014any chance\u2014to stay alive, no matter what it entailed? Would she do it even if it meant giving up everything she knew and loved and surviving on the blood of others? Would she be willing to take a life to save her own?</p><p>For the first time, she wondered how many lives Rhys had taken during his years of existence? How often did he have to...She frowned. Did he call it eating? Drinking? Where did he spend the day? Did he sleep in a coffin? How long had he been a vampire? Were there other vampires in LA? And if so, how many?</p><p>She thought about what she had read on the Web. Did garlic really repel vampires? What about holy water and crosses? Could he turn into a bat? Why would he want to?</p><p>Feeling a headache coming on, she pressed her fingertips to her temples.</p><p>\u201cForget about Rhys,\u201d she muttered. \u201cWhat are you going to do with a roommate who\u2019s a vampire?\u201d</p><p>In the morning, over breakfast, Megan tried yet again to talk some sense into her friend, but to no avail. Shirl\u2019s mind was made up.</p><p>Megan took a deep breath. She had only one argument left. \u201cHave you thought about the blood thing? Really thought about it? About what you\u2019ll have to do to get it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t have a problem with that? You\u2019re telling me you could kill someone for their blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVampires don\u2019t have to kill,\u201d Shirl retorted, a sharp edge to her voice. \u201cGive it up, Megan. I\u2019ve made my decision.\u201d She paused a moment, then said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Meggie. I didn\u2019t mean to snap at you. I know you don\u2019t approve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your life,\u201d Megan said quietly. \u201cYour decision. I just hope you don\u2019t regret it.\u201d</p><p>Megan was too nervous to go to work that night. She called Mr. Parker to let him know she needed to take another day off, and then spent the morning and early afternoon cleaning the house while Shirl slept. She mopped the floors, dusted the furniture, cleaned the bathrooms, scrubbed the toilets, did the laundry, even baked a cake she was too upset to eat.</p><p>She had hoped keeping busy would take her mind off Shirl\u2019s decision. It didn\u2019t, of course. While cleaning the mirror, she wondered how Shirl would feel when she could no longer look at her reflection and see how beautiful she was. When she took the cake out of the oven, it reminded her that Shirl\u2019s birthday was next month, but if Shirl went through with her insane plan, they wouldn\u2019t be celebrating Shirl\u2019s birthday with her favorite fudge marble cake and chocolate ice cream.</p><p>How did one become a vampire, anyway? Was being bitten the only way?</p><p>After turning off the oven, Megan sat down at the computer, went to Google, and typed in \u201chow to become a vampire.\u201d As always, she was amazed at the number of Web pages that turned up.</p><p>According to one site, there were three ways to become a vampire: you were born that way; another vampire bit you and turned you into one of the Undead; or it happened after you died. She frowned as she read about the last way, wondering if anyone had ever really believed anything so farfetched. For instance, in some places it was believed that if a body was buried face up, it might become a vampire. Improper burial, no burial, the wind, or a shadow falling over the corpse might cause the deceased to rise again.</p><p>According to another site, you might become a vampire if a dog or a cat jumped over your corpse. Russian folklore held that vampires had once been witches.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know much about vampires, but being bitten by another vampire seemed like the most logical way to join the ranks of the fanged and dangerous.</p><p>Shirl woke late in the afternoon. She picked at the lunch Megan prepared for her, then locked herself in the bathroom, saying she wanted her hair and makeup to look perfect when she was turned.</p><p>Feeling like she was trapped in a bad B movie, Megan went into the backyard, where she spent the next two hours pulling weeds and praying that Shirl would come to her senses before it was too late.</p><p>When she went back into the house, Shirl was in the living room doing her nails.</p><p>\u201cAre you going out?\u201d Megan asked, thinking what a silly question it was. Of course, Shirl wasn\u2019t going out.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m just getting ready. I want to look my best when he turns me. Some people believe that however you look when it happens is how you\u2019ll look forever. And I want to look good.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring the knot tightening in the pit of her stomach, Megan nodded, then went upstairs to take a shower. She wanted to look good, too, and the fact that she did irritated the heck out of her. But Rhys would be there soon, and, even though it was over between them, she didn\u2019t want him to see her in a pair of worn jeans with her hair all scraggly and dirt under her fingernails.</p><p>She slipped into a pair of white pants and a blue silk shirt, brushed her hair, applied her makeup, spritzed herself with perfume, and went downstairs.</p><p>\u201cI ordered dinner from all my favorite places,\u201d Shirl said, indicating several covered trays on the coffee table. \u201cFilet mignon, lobster, shrimp, and all the trimmings. Pizza. And half a gallon of chocolate fudge brownie ice cream for dessert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour last meal?\u201d Megan asked, unable to keep the bitterness out of her voice.</p><p>\u201cMeggie...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShirl! Think about what you\u2019re doing! This isn\u2019t right. It isn\u2019t natural.\u201d</p><p>Shirl clapped her hands over her ears. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear it! My mind is made up. You\u2019d do the same thing in my place.\u201d</p><p>Megan started to deny it, then dropped down onto the sofa. She had no idea what she would do in Shirl\u2019s place. She knew what she hoped she would do, but when it came right down to it, there was no way to know until it happened.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Meggie.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Megan surrendered with a nod. \u201cI\u2019ll pour the wine.\u201d</p><p>They had just finished dinner when the doorbell rang.</p><p>Megan didn\u2019t miss the panicked look that flashed in Shirl\u2019s eyes before she blinked it away. Hope flared in Megan\u2019s heart. Maybe Shirl wasn\u2019t as sure about her decision as she thought.</p> <p>Megan took a deep breath before she went to answer the door.</p><p>Rhys was dressed all in black. Fitting, Megan thought, since he was bringing death into the house.</p><p>She stared at him, struck again by the sheer beauty of the man. Unable to think of anything to say, she didn\u2019t say anything at all, just turned on her heel and walked back into the living room. When he didn\u2019t follow, she remembered she had rescinded her invitation.</p><p>She was about to invite him in when Shirl called, \u201cMr. Costain, please come in.\u201d</p><p>Megan felt an odd vibration in the air as he crossed the threshold. Why hadn\u2019t she felt it before?</p> <p>He moved into the living room on silent feet. Watching him, Megan wondered what was different about him. And then she knew. He was no longer hiding the truth of what he was. The supernatural power that was a part of him was a palpable presence in the air. Stunned by the irrefutable truth, she sank down on the chair beside the sofa.</p><p>\u201cPlease, sit down, Mr. Costain,\u201d Shirl invited with a weak smile.</p><p>\u201cNo need to be so formal,\u201d he replied, taking a place on the sofa beside her.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cRhys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s better. Are you sure you want this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you know how it\u2019s done?\u201d</p><p>Shirl clasped her hands in her lap. \u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you done this before?\u201d</p><p>Megan leaned forward, her arms wrapped tightly around her waist, as she waited for his answer. Funny, she had never wondered about that.</p><p>\u201cOnce or twice,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnd were they...\u201d Shirl hesitated a moment, as if searching for the right word. \u201cSuccessful?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAnything else?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWill it hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s quite pleasant, actually. I\u2019ll drink from you. You\u2019ll drink from me. When you wake tomorrow night, you\u2019ll be as I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a question,\u201d Megan said, and felt her breath catch in her throat when Rhys turned to look at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it going to be safe for me to live with a vampire, or do I need to find a new roommate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeggie!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Shirl, but I have to know what to expect.\u201d</p><p>Rhys nodded. \u201cIt might be wise for Shirl to move in with me for a few days, until she becomes accustomed to her new lifestyle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never hurt Megan!\u201d Shirl exclaimed. \u201cShe\u2019s my best friend!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not intentionally,\u201d Rhys said. \u201cBut it\u2019s sometimes difficult for new vampires to control their thirst.\u201d He\u2019d had to destroy the first vampire he\u2019d made for that very reason. She had run amok, killing everything in sight, putting his existence and the lives of everyone she knew in danger. \u201cSo, are you ready?\u201d</p><p>When Shirl didn\u2019t answer right away, Megan felt a rush of hope. Had Shirl finally come to her senses and changed her mind? Hardly daring to breathe, Megan waited for Shirl\u2019s answer.</p><p>Rhys sat beside Shirl, unmoving, patient as only a man who isn\u2019t ruled by time can be.</p><p>\u201cShirl,\u201d Megan whispered. \u201cPlease don\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>A single tear glistened in Shirl\u2019s eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Meggie,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>Megan nodded. She had done all she could. The rest was up to Shirl, but she didn\u2019t have to watch. Rising, she said, \u201cI\u2019ll wait upstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Shirl exclaimed. \u201cI want you to be here.\u201d</p><p>Megan stared at her best friend, horrified by the mere idea. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>When Shirl seemed reluctant to answer, Rhys answered for her. \u201cI think she wants you here in case something goes wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong?\u201d Megan echoed. \u201cWhat could go wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf her will to live isn\u2019t strong enough, she won\u2019t survive the exchange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShirl, is that true? Are you telling me you\u2019re willing to do this when you might die anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the best chance I have,\u201d Shirl replied, her voice barely audible. \u201cPlease stay with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not sure, we can do this another time,\u201d Rhys said.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Shirl said, her voice tinged with desperation. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be now!\u201d She pressed her hands to the sides of her head. \u201cI can\u2019t stand the pain any longer.\u201d She looked at Rhys, her eyes wild. \u201cDo it! Do it now!\u201d</p><p>With a nod, Rhys drew her into his embrace, then gently brushed the hair away from her neck. \u201cRelax, child,\u201d he murmured, his voice soft, soothing. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be afraid of.\u201d He caught her gaze with his as he slid his knuckles down the length of her neck. \u201cThat\u2019s right, just relax.\u201d</p><p>Unable to look away, Megan stared at the two of them. It was almost as if they were making love. As Rhys continued to speak quietly to Shirl, her eyes took on a glazed, faraway look. Her body sagged against his, her head fell back over his arm, her eyelids fluttered down.</p><p>Megan\u2019s heart slammed against her rib cage when Rhys lifted his gaze to hers. Preternatural power crawled over her skin. For a moment, she was tempted to go to him, to throw her arms around him and surrender to the longing she read in his eyes.</p><p>It took all the willpower she had to look away.</p><p>Only to feel her gaze drawn back to the scene before her.</p><p>Rhys\u2019s attention was wholly focused on Shirl now. He stroked his fingers along the length of her neck again; then, bending over her, he sank his fangs into the soft skin of her throat.</p><p>The faint, coppery scent of blood rose in the air.</p><p>Megan\u2019s hands clenched in her lap. She should stop him now, before it was too late. Could she revoke Shirl\u2019s invitation?</p><p>Shirl moaned softly, then went completely limp in Rhys\u2019s embrace.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Megan asked anxiously. \u201cIs she...?\u201d The words stilled in her throat when he lifted his head to look at her. His eyes glowed red. She saw blood on his fangs before he licked it away.</p><p>Feeling light-headed, Megan watched as he bit into his own wrist, then held the bleeding wound to Shirl\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cDrink, Shirl.\u201d His voice was low yet edged with steel.</p><p>With a soft cry, Shirl grabbed hold of his arm and pressed her mouth to the wound.</p><p>Fighting nausea, Megan lurched to her feet. She could feel Rhys\u2019s gaze on her back as she fled the room and staggered up the stairs.</p><p>Safe in her bedroom, with the door locked, she fell across the bed and cried bitter tears for the death of her best friend.</p><p>Tom\u00e1s Villagrande lifted his head, the lovely dusky-skinned woman in his arms forgotten as, somewhere in the heart of the city, Rhys Costain brought a new vampire into the fold.</p><p>Chapter 25</p><p>When she had no tears left, Megan dried her eyes. Admonishing herself to stop being a coward, she went into the bathroom and splashed cold water on her face, then went back downstairs. She had to make sure Shirl was still alive. No, not alive. Undead.</p><p>Rhys looked up when she entered the room. He hadn\u2019t moved. As far as Megan could tell, neither had Shirl. She looked even paler than before. And she didn\u2019t seem to be breathing.</p><p>Megan met Rhys\u2019s gaze. \u201cIs she all right?\u201d she asked anxiously. \u201cIs she...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Rhys replied. \u201cShe\u2019ll sleep tonight and all day tomorrow.\u201d He brushed a lock of hair from Shirl\u2019s cheek. It was an achingly tender touch. And then he looked at Megan. \u201cWhen the sun goes down, she\u2019ll rise as a new vampire.\u201d</p><p>Megan swallowed hard against the bile that burned the back of her throat. A new vampire. Shirl had always been fascinated with the Undead. Maybe this was what she had been searching for her whole life.</p><p>Rhys studied her, one brow raised. \u201cYou don\u2019t approve.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question.</p><p>\u201cOf course not! You\u2019ve turned my best friend into a...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on, say it,\u201d he challenged. \u201cI\u2019ve turned her into a monster, like me.\u201d</p><p>Megan took a step back, as if to distance herself from the truth. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you were thinking it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay out of my head!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could.\u201d He eased Shirl down onto the sofa, then rose, his eyes sparking with anger.</p><p>Power rolled off him in waves. That, combined with the barely suppressed fury in his eyes, frightened Megan to the depths of her being, but she refused to let him intimidate her. Clenching her hands at her sides, she glared up at him, a sinking feeling in the pit of her stomach. What had happened to the man who had once made love to her so tenderly, she wondered, even as an annoying voice in the back of her mind whispered that Rhys Costain wasn\u2019t a man at all.</p><p>\u201cMonster.\u201d He spat the word at her. \u201cIt\u2019s what you see when you look at me now, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She wanted to deny it, but she couldn\u2019t force the words past her lips.</p><p>\u201cDamn you!\u201d Hissing the words, he closed the distance between them quicker than her eyes could follow and pulled her body up against his. \u201cDamn you,\u201d he repeated, but this time, it sounded like a caress.</p><p>He kissed her then, a low growl rising in his throat as his tongue plundered her mouth. There was no gentleness in him, no tenderness.</p><p>She reeled under the assault on her senses\u2014the hard length of his body pressed intimately against hers, the heat of his tongue dueling with her own. His arm was like a band of solid steel holding her prisoner. She whimpered softly, barely able to breathe as his arm tightened around her, pulling her closer still.</p><p>She knew he wanted to hurt her, to prove, in some perverse way, that he was the monster his actions showed him to be. But, monster or not, she clung to him, her body quickly responding to the strength of his arms, the force of his kisses, the way his hand caressed her hair. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rhys muttered something under his breath as he released her, and even though she didn\u2019t recognize the language, she knew he was swearing. Some words sounded the same no matter how you said them.</p><p>Turning away, Rhys scooped Shirl into his arms. \u201cI\u2019ll take good care of her,\u201d he said curtly, and with his gaze riveted on Megan, he vanished from her sight.</p><p>\u201cShow-off,\u201d Megan murmured, and burst into tears.</p> <p>Rhys carried Shirl to his penthouse lair, settled her in his bed, then went out onto the balcony, his thoughts in turmoil. Why had he agreed to turn Megan\u2019s roommate? Had he hoped, in some distant part of his mind, that by saving Shirl he could regain Megan\u2019s affection?</p><p>He snorted with disgust at his own foolishness. If anything, he had caused Megan to hate him all the more. And now he had an unwanted fledgling on his hands.</p><p>The wind stirred, whispering through the trees, sending leaves and debris skittering along the sidewalk.</p><p>And on the freshening wind, Rhys caught the scent of an unfamiliar vampire. Cursing softly, he was about to vault over the railing to the street below when the vampire materialized beside him.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell!\u201d Rhys hissed.</p> <p>Looking faintly amused, the vampire bowed from the waist. \u201cTom\u00e1s Villagrande,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you are Rhys Costain, Master of the City, are you not?\u201d</p><p>Rhys nodded. Tom\u00e1s Villagrande was tall and lean, with dark brown hair and hooded brown eyes. He appeared to be in his late twenties.</p><p>\u201cWhat brings you to my territory?\u201d Rhys asked.</p><p>Villagrande shrugged. \u201cI had a yearning to see the West Coast, to sail the waters of the Pacific.\u201d His eyes turned hard. \u201cDo you have a problem with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you hunt in my territory. You\u2019ve left quite a trail of carnage in your wake. Don\u2019t bring it here.\u201d</p><p>Villagrande drew himself up to his full height.</p> <p>Though Rhys was several inches taller than Villagrande and outweighed him by a good thirty pounds, the other vampire\u2019s preternatural power was a force to be reckoned with. Rhys felt it like a heavy hand trying to crush his own strength, a ponderous weight pushing against his mind. He brought his own power to bear, infusing it with his anger, his frustration.</p><p>Villagrande grinned impudently. \u201cYou are strong,\u201d he said, a hint of admiration in his voice. \u201cAnd stubborn.\u201d He jerked his chin toward the door of the penthouse. \u201cThe woman inside, is she yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in the way you mean.\u201d</p><p>Villagrande grunted softly. \u201cThe young ones. You never know how they\u2019ll turn out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s under my protection, as are all the vampires in my territory. I will not take it kindly if harm comes to any of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need you to tell me how to behave,\u201d Villagrande said with asperity. \u201cI could destroy you with a thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdrianna.\u201d Villagrande spat her name. \u201cI believe she\u2019s hiding somewhere in your territory.\u201d</p> <p>Rhys nodded. There was no point in denying it. \u201cIs she why you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPartly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill looking for retribution?\u201d</p><p>Villagrande\u2019s eyes flickered with surprise. \u201cShe told you?\u201d</p><p>Rhys shrugged. \u201cI like to know what\u2019s going on with anyone who stays in my territory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe took something that was mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a long time ago. Why not forget it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is between me and Adrianna. It doesn\u2019t concern you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything that happens in my territory concerns me. I don\u2019t particularly like Adrianna, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can just waltz in here and take her out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think you can stop me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I hope I don\u2019t have to find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave any corpses in my city. I like it here, and I\u2019m not looking to move any time soon.\u201d</p><p>Villagrande inclined his head. \u201cAs you wish. For now.\u201d And with that begrudging promise, he was gone.</p><p>Rhys muttered an oath. He had lost Megan. He had a fledgling sleeping in his lair. And now the most powerful vampire in the world was stalking the streets of his city. What was Villagrande really doing here? Hard to believe his only reasons for leaving the East were to avenge himself on Adrianna and sail the Pacific.</p><p>He raked his fingers through his hair. He should probably warn Adrianna that Villagrande was in town.</p><p>Pulling his cell phone from his pocket, he punched in her number.</p><p>Lingering on the sidewalk beneath Costain\u2019s lair, Villagrande listened to the conversation between the Master of the West Coast Vampires and Adrianna.</p><p>Avenging himself on Adrianna was the first order of business. He could, as Costain had suggested, forget about seeking revenge. Hell, he couldn\u2019t even remember the face or the name of the long-deceased woman who had been the cause of their feud, but if he let Adrianna\u2019s lack of respect go unchallenged, others might see it as a sign of weakness.</p><p>And then there was the West Coast. He had forgotten the beauty of the Pacific Ocean, the mild climate, the long-legged, tanned California girls. Why visit for a short time when he could just take over the territory? Of course, it might prove a difficult task. Rhys Costain was a force to be reckoned with. He was strong and more powerful than expected, but that would only make the coming battle more challenging.</p><p>As for the woman in Costain\u2019s lair, she excited him, though Tom\u00e1s was at a loss to explain why. He had never seen her. Didn\u2019t know her name. But her scent, the beat of her heart, they called to him in ways he didn\u2019t understand. And since she wasn\u2019t Costain\u2019s woman, taking her shouldn\u2019t be a problem.</p><p>Chapter 26</p><p>Megan woke early after a night plagued with bad dreams. Rising, she pulled on her robe and tiptoed down the hall to Shirl\u2019s bedroom to assure herself that it had all been a nightmare. She would look in Shirl\u2019s room and find her friend asleep in her bed, the covers pulled over her head, her Beauty and the Beast night-light burning.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Megan quietly opened the door. The room was dark. The bed was empty. So, it hadn\u2019t been a dream. Last night, Rhys had turned her roommate into a vampire. And now Shirl was in his lair, sleeping the sleep of the Undead, and when she woke...</p><p>Megan shuddered. She couldn\u2019t help wondering what her roommate would think when she woke tonight and discovered she was really and truly a vampire. Would she regret it, or would she still believe it had been the right decision? What would she think when she couldn\u2019t see her reflection in a mirror anymore? Shirl had always been a little vain about her looks, but then, who could blame her? She was gorgeous. How would she react to the reality of having to drink blood to survive? Granted, Shirl\u2019s former diet had been pretty restricted, but even celery had to be better than blood.</p><p>Megan had done a lot of research on the Undead in the last week or so. She wasn\u2019t sure how much of what she had read on the Web was fact and how much was fiction. But, thanks to Rhys, she knew the blood thing was real.</p><p>Megan shook her head. Her roommate barely weighed a hundred pounds soaking wet. Megan simply couldn\u2019t imagine her petite friend prowling around in the dead of night looking for prey.</p><p>Her mind kept coming back to the fact that Shirl was sharing Rhys\u2019s lair. Was she also sharing his bed? Rhys was an attractive man. Shirl was a beautiful woman.... Megan pushed the troublesome thought from her mind. It was none of her business. She had no claim on Rhys. And Shirl...what was she going to do about Shirl? Was it safe to live with a vampire? Especially a new vampire?</p><p>Shirl woke slowly. She felt funny. Different. Not quite herself. She lifted a hand to her head. Was she dying? Was this what death was like, this sudden clarity of sight and sound? A reminder of the perfection of life before it was snatched away? The room was dark, yet she could see everything clearly\u2014the faint crack in the ceiling overhead; each individual thread in the silk sheet that covered her; the tiny dent on the edge of the antique dresser across from the bed.</p><p>She sat up, feeling slightly disoriented. This wasn\u2019t her room. Where was she?</p><p>She jumped when the door opened and a light came on, then let out a sigh when she saw who it was.</p><p>\u201cRhys.\u201d She blinked at him as everything that had happened the night before came rushing back. She frowned, and then she smiled. \u201cIt worked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it would seem.\u201d He stepped farther into the room, his gaze moving over her. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p><p>She thought about it a moment, then said, \u201cWonderful! My head doesn\u2019t hurt anymore!\u201d Leaping off the bed, she threw her arms around him. \u201cThank you!\u201d she cried exuberantly, and kissed him.</p><p>She was beautiful, her body was pressed against his, and he did what any other man would do. He kissed her back, pretending, for a moment, that it was Megan in his arms. And then he gently pushed her away.</p><p>\u201cNo regrets?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She laughed softly. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, but it\u2019s a little early to tell.\u201d She pressed a hand to her stomach. \u201cI think I\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><p>Rhys nodded. Her eyes had taken on a red hue. \u201cTime for your first lesson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLesson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVampire hunting 101,\u201d he explained. \u201cRule number one. I\u2019m the Master of the West Coast Vampires. You\u2019re my fledgling. This is my territory. As long as you stay here, you do as I say. Got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re learning,\u201d he said, ignoring the sarcasm in her voice. \u201cRule number two. I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s allowed to hunt in this city, and I do it only rarely. Smart vampires don\u2019t hunt where they live.\u201d</p><p>Shirl nodded. That made sense.</p><p>\u201cNumber three. For as long as you exist, there will be a blood connection between us. I\u2019ll always be able to find you, and if you bring trouble into my territory, I\u2019ll destroy you. Got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY...yes.\u201d She hesitated a moment, then asked, \u201cWill you tell me something?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDepends on what you want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been a vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive hundred and twelve years.\u201d</p> <p>She backed away from him and sat down on the edge of the bed. \u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo where?\u201d She glanced around the room, noting the heavy curtains across the window, the fact that there was no mirror over the dresser, the heavy lock on the door.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hungry, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I thought...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat? That I\u2019d feed you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, sort of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a rule, vampires don\u2019t feed off their own kind. A taste now and then is okay, but no more than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She bit down on her lower lip. She had known she would have to drink blood, but she had assumed it would be something she could work up to gradually.</p><p>\u201cSo, are you ready?\u201d He didn\u2019t wait for her reply.</p><p>Shirl gasped when he scooped her into his arms. A kind of dizziness engulfed her, and, when the world righted itself, they were outside a small tavern. She could hear waves in the distance, smell the salty tang of the ocean, hear the conversation coming from inside the bar. \u201cWhere are we? How did you do that?\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged as he set her on her feet. \u201cJust another way of getting around when you\u2019re in a hurry. We\u2019re in Manhattan Beach. When we go into the bar, I want you to look around, find someone who appeals to you, and call him, or her, to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? You mean, just call them? Out loud?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, mentally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not psychic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a vampire. You can pretty much do whatever you want. Come on.\u201d</p><p>Shirl followed him into the tavern. It was nothing like what she was used to. The interior was shabby, the air was stale, heavy with the stink of smoke and sweat. Three young men were playing billiards in the far corner of the room. A woman Shirl realized was a hooker was discussing her price with a nervous-looking, middle-aged man. Several other men and women sat at the bar. A pair of young women stood in front of the jukebox, trying to decide what song to play.</p><p>Shirl pressed her hands over her ears, trying to shut out the cacophony of conversation and thoughts that bombarded her. And the smells! Perspiration, perfume, alcohol, cigarette smoke, soap, and deodorant. It was overpowering. But it was the beating of so many living hearts, the rush of blood through miles of veins, that overrode everything else. She groaned softly. She was hungry, so hungry.</p><p>She glanced at the men and women sitting at the bar. One of the men turned to look at her. He was young, in his midtwenties, with shaggy brown hair, blue eyes, and a mustache. He looked clean and didn\u2019t smell too bad. His name was Don, but people called him Sharkey.</p> <p>Feeling a little foolish, she concentrated on sending him a mental summons. To her astonishment, he stood and walked toward her, his expression somewhat bemused, as if he couldn\u2019t believe what he was doing.</p><p>\u201cHey, beautiful,\u201d he murmured. \u201cWhat\u2019s a gorgeous gal like you doing in a dump like this?\u201d</p><p>Shirl licked her lips. \u201cWould you come outside with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, honey,\u201d Sharkey said with a wink and a smile. \u201cWhat did you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to show you something.\u201d Shirl looked at Rhys. Am I doing this right?</p><p>At his nod, she took Sharkey\u2019s hand and led him outside and around the corner of the building into the shadows beyond.</p><p>When Sharkey noticed Rhys following them, he tried to pull out of her grasp. Shirl didn\u2019t know which of them was more surprised when he couldn\u2019t break her grip.</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d Shirl asked, looking to Rhys for help.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see what kind of vampire you are,\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cJust follow your instincts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVampire!\u201d Sharkey exclaimed. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d He tried again to jerk out of Shirl\u2019s grasp. \u201cDammit, let me go!\u201d</p><p>Shirl gazed deeply into his eyes. \u201cBe quiet and hold still!\u201d she said angrily, and when he complied, she looked over at Rhys again, waiting for his approval.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing just fine.\u201d</p><p>Shirl swallowed hard. Pain gnawed at her insides, a horrible twisting pain worse than anything she had ever known. Worse, even, than the headaches that had driven her to this. She took a deep breath, her gaze drawn to the pulse throbbing in the hollow of the man\u2019s throat. She could smell his fear. And his blood. And suddenly he wasn\u2019t a man anymore, he was prey. The hunger raged inside her. Desperate to end it, she pulled the man into her arms, felt an ache in her gums as her fangs extended.</p><p>Fangs.</p><p>Vampire.</p><p>Bending the man back over her arm, Shirl lowered her head to his neck. You can do this. She was surprised at how quickly and easily her fangs pierced his flesh. She had expected the act to be abhorrent, the taste disgusting. How could she have been so wrong? Nothing in all the world had ever tasted so wonderful or satisfied her so completely.</p><p>Rhys licked his lips as the scent of fresh, hot blood rose in the air. \u201cEnough, Shirl,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>She lifted her head, her narrowed eyes as red as the blood on her lips.</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>Stop, now? Was he mad? She wanted more, and when she finished with this man, she wanted another. And another. She glared at Rhys, and then she lowered her head to the man\u2019s neck again.</p><p>\u201cEnough, dammit!\u201d Rhys said. \u201cAny more, and you\u2019ll kill him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I do.\u201d Before she realized what was happening, Rhys snatched the man from her grasp, and then slapped her across the face. \u201cI said enough!\u201d</p><p>Stricken, she stared at Rhys, horrified by what she had almost done. She didn\u2019t want to kill anyone. And yet she wanted more. She wanted it all.</p><p>\u201cYou will listen to what I say,\u201d Rhys said angrily. \u201cAnd you will do what I say, or I will destroy you. I warned you once. I\u2019ll have no killing in my territory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she murmured contritely, and then she looked up at him. \u201cHow can you stop when they taste so good?\u201d She licked the blood from her lips. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me it would taste so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want to be a monster, that\u2019s fine with me. But not in my town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>He grunted softly. \u201cYou can control it if you want to. It won\u2019t be easy at first, but you can do it. Now, you need to lick the wounds in his neck to seal them, then tell him to go back to the bar and get something to drink. And, most importantly, you must always remember to wipe the memory of what\u2019s happened from his mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do that? Erase his memory? How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoin your mind with his. You\u2019ll know what to do.\u201d</p><p>Rhys watched Shirl carefully. He\u2019d had his doubts about how well she would adapt to becoming a vampire, but she seemed to be one of those who accepted the Dark Gift without a qualm. Sometimes he wondered if some people were predestined to join the ranks of the Undead.</p><p>He watched Sharkey stagger around the corner. The man would never know it, but he\u2019d had a close encounter with death that night.</p><p>The thought had barely crossed his mind when the scent of another vampire reached his nostrils, and Tom\u00e1s Villagrande strolled into view.</p><p>\u201cYou!\u201d Rhys hissed. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaking in the sea air,\u201d Villagrande replied.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. You followed us. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to meet the newest member of our community,\u201d Villagrande said, smiling at Shirl. \u201cAnd one of the loveliest, I might add.\u201d</p><p>Shirl smiled uncertainly before murmuring, \u201cThank you.\u201d She took a step closer to Rhys. She didn\u2019t know who the stranger was, but she knew instinctively that he was an old vampire. Old and dangerous. His power washed over her.</p><p>Tom\u00e1s reached for her hand. Bending over it in an old-world bow, he said, \u201cTom\u00e1s Villagrande, at your service.\u201d</p><p>Feeling totally out of her element, Shirl said, \u201cI\u2019m pleased to meet you, Mr. Villagrande.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, my dear Shirley, call me Tom\u00e1s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough of your smooth talk, Villagrande,\u201d Rhys said irritably. \u201cI have a lot to teach her before the sun comes up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed?\u201d Tom\u00e1s smiled at Shirl again. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to learn how to be a vampire, why not learn from the oldest of our kind? I can teach you things he does not yet know.\u201d</p><p>Shirl looked at Rhys. What should I do? Villagrande frightened her, yet she was drawn to him on some deep primal level that she didn\u2019t understand. Was it just the overwhelming sweep of his preternatural power? Or something more mundane, like the fact that he was quite remarkable-looking. Sort of the way she imagined a Barbary pirate might look. Rhys, tell me what to do.</p><p>He shook his head, the movement almost imperceptible. This is something you\u2019ll have to decide for yourself, but I would advise you not to go with him.</p><p>\u201cThank you for the offer,\u201d Shirl said, \u201cbut I think I\u2019ll stay with Rhys.\u201d</p><p>Irritation flashed in Villagrande\u2019s eyes. With an obvious effort, he reined in his anger. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t regret it.\u201d</p><p>Shirl flinched. Had he just threatened her? In an effort to placate him, she murmured, \u201cPerhaps another time.\u201d</p><p>But it was too late. He was already gone.</p><p>Shirl looked up at Rhys. \u201cI think we could have handled that better,\u201d she said, her expression pensive.</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s old, isn\u2019t he? Older, even, than you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. No one knows just how old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could feel his power. It was...scary.\u201d Scary, and exhilarating.</p><p>Rhys grunted softly. There wasn\u2019t much on this earth that scared him, but Tom\u00e1s Villagrande was at the top of the list.</p><p>Chapter 27</p><p>Megan spent all of Saturday, Sunday, and Monday worrying about Shirl. Was her friend truly a vampire now? How was she handling it? Megan hadn\u2019t decided if having a vampire for a roommate was a good idea, but Shirl was still her best friend, and she was concerned about her welfare. Time and again, Megan picked up her cell phone and dialed her roommate\u2019s number, but there was no answer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>By Tuesday afternoon, when Shirl still hadn\u2019t called, Megan\u2019s worry for her friend bordered on anger. Shirl must know that Megan would be worrying, wondering. The least she could do was call, and if, for one reason or another, Shirl couldn\u2019t make one lousy phone call, then Rhys should have done it.</p><p>Megan arrived at Shore\u2019s early that night, glad to have an excuse to get out of the house and mingle with people who didn\u2019t have fangs, drink blood, or sleep in coffins.</p><p>At midnight, force of habit had her glancing at the front door. She shook her head, wondering how long it would take her to stop expecting Rhys to show up.</p> <p>At 12:05, he strolled into the store with Shirl on his arm.</p><p>Megan stared at Shirl. Her friend had always been beautiful but now...Megan shook her head. Impossible as it seemed, Shirl was even more gorgeous than ever. The changes were subtle. Anyone who hadn\u2019t known Shirl before wouldn\u2019t be aware of them, but they were there. Her skin was a little more translucent, a little paler. Her hair was thicker and more lustrous. And she possessed an almost tangible aura of seductive power that hadn\u2019t been there before.</p><p>But it was Rhys who held Megan\u2019s gaze. He wore a long-sleeved black silk shirt open over a blood-red T-shirt, and a pair of snug black jeans. He reminded her of a wild jungle cat, lean and lithe. She couldn\u2019t take her eyes off of him.</p><p>\u201cMegan!\u201d Shirl hurried toward her, moving with the same fluidity that Megan had noticed in Rhys.</p><p>Feeling like the ugly duckling welcoming the swan, Megan forced a smile. \u201cHi.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHi?\u201d Shirl repeated with a frown. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should anything be wrong?\u201d Megan tried to mask her anger behind a smile, and failed. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you called me? I\u2019ve been worried sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Shirl said. \u201cI guess it was thoughtless of me, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter now.\u201d Megan glanced at Rhys, then back at Shirl, and couldn\u2019t help feeling...what? Jealous? That was ridiculous, and yet, like it or not, she felt like an outsider, as if they had joined an exclusive club to which she could never belong.</p><p>She was relieved when a man entered the shop, breaking the awkward silence between them. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re all right. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have a customer.\u201d</p><p>Relief turned to regret as she watched Rhys and Shirl leave the store.</p> <p>When Megan got off work that night, Rhys was waiting for her in the parking lot. She couldn\u2019t stifle a rush of pleasure at seeing him standing beside her car.</p><p>\u201cMegan, we need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Shirl?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI sent her back to my place.\u201d</p><p>She folded her arms and lifted her chin. \u201cWhat do you want to talk about?</p><p>\u201cYou. Me. Us.\u201d</p><p>Taking a tight rein on her tumultuous emotions, she said, \u201cThere is no us.\u201d</p><p>Her heartbeat slammed into overdrive when he took a step toward her. \u201cIsn\u2019t there?\u201d He placed his hand on her breast. \u201cI can feel your heart beating for me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I? Tell me you don\u2019t want me. Say it out loud, and you\u2019ll never see me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRhys, I don\u2019t need this right now. Please, just go away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay you don\u2019t want me, and I\u2019m gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, I want you! Are you happy? But it doesn\u2019t change anything.\u201d</p><p>He moved still closer. Too close. Memories of the times they had made love flashed across her mind. She wished she could go back in time, to the days before she knew what he was, when ignorance had, indeed, been bliss. But there was no going back. No changing what he was, or what he had done to Shirl.</p><p>Blinking back her tears, she turned her back to him and unlocked the car door. \u201cI have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit, Megan, don\u2019t do this.\u201d He put his hand on the top edge of the door so she couldn\u2019t open it. \u201cAt least give us a chance.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you found out what I was, I told myself it was for the best, that you were better off without me. That it would never work between us. But now...dammit, Megan, I\u2019m begging you. Stay with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to, but I can\u2019t. I\u2019m afraid. Afraid of what I\u2019ve seen. Afraid of what you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t change that.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him over her shoulder, her eyes brimming with tears. \u201cBut you can change me. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m really afraid of.\u201d</p><p>Placing his hands on her shoulders, he turned her around so she was facing him again. \u201cWould you believe me if I swore that I will never do that to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit!\u201d He raked his hand through his hair. \u201cMegan, what can I do? What can I say to change your mind?</p><p>Her tears came faster now, rolling unchecked down her cheeks. What did she want? How could she trust him? How could she let him go? He was right. She wanted him. She couldn\u2019t fight him anymore, couldn\u2019t fight the longing of her own heart. With a sigh, she rested her forehead against his chest, felt her tears start again as his arms closed lovingly around her. Right or wrong, for better or worse, this was where she wanted to be.</p><p>Placing a finger beneath her chin, he tilted her head up, then brushed her tears away. \u201cCan I drive you home?\u201d</p><p>With a nod, she handed him the keys to her car.</p><p>She was acutely aware of his nearness on the way home. His presence filled the car, or maybe it was her increased awareness of his power. She had always thought he was just exceptionally handsome, but after seeing the subtle changes in Shirl, she knew the flawless perfection of his face and form were a by-product of being a vampire.</p><p>When they reached her house, Rhys parked the car in the driveway, then came around to open her door.</p><p>Megan felt suddenly shy as they walked up to the porch. He unlocked the door and followed her inside. She dropped her handbag on the sofa table; he tossed her keys on top, then drew her into his arms.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cMore than you can imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it okay if I kiss you?\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly, amused that he would ask. Taking him by the hand, she led him to the sofa, pulled him down beside her, and kissed him.</p><p>His arms went around her once more, drawing her body against his. With a sigh of contentment, she closed her eyes and leaned into him, hungry for his touch, for his kisses. They could never have a normal life together and she knew it, but it didn\u2019t matter. He was here now, and she intended to savor every moment she could. And when it was over...She shook the thought away. She wouldn\u2019t worry about that now. It felt too good to be in his arms, to feel his body against hers, to hold him and taste him.</p><p>When they parted, Rhys leaned back against the sofa. Utterly breathless, Megan snuggled against him. She glanced at the fireplace, thinking how cozy a fire would be. She sat up, startled, when fire sprang to life in the hearth a moment later.</p><p>Beside her, Rhys laughed softly.</p><p>\u201cDid you do that?\u201d Megan asked. It was a silly question. Who else could have done it?</p><p>\u201cYou wanted one, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but...You could have warned me,\u201d she said, resting her head on his shoulder. \u201cWhat other tricks can you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDogs do tricks,\u201d he said, sounding offended.</p><p>\u201cWell, what do you call it, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s power, my sweet. Vampire power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now Shirl has it, too.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question, but a statement of fact. \u201cI don\u2019t think I want her as a roommate anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been expecting that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea, either. She\u2019s not sure she can control herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she\u2019s going to stay with you?\u201d Megan didn\u2019t like that arrangement in the least.</p><p>\u201cNo. She\u2019s going to find her own place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? How\u2019s she going to pay for it?\u201d Shirl had made good money as a model, but she had never saved any.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got a job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can she model now? She can\u2019t work during the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe called her agent and told him she\u2019s come down with some rare disease and that her doctor advised her to stay out of the sun.\u201d</p><p>Megan frowned. \u201cI thought vampires couldn\u2019t be photographed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was true in the old days, but everything changed with the advent of digital cameras.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess a lot of things have changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept the way I feel about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRhys...what are we doing? This can\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but I can\u2019t seem to stay away from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Megan, you tempt me in so many ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me,\u201d she whispered. \u201cShow me, show me, show me....\u201d</p><p>Falling back on the sofa, he drew her down on top of him, his mouth claiming hers in a kiss that was gentle and desperate at the same time. She kissed him back with the same intensity, refusing to worry about what the future might hold. They were together now, and that was all that mattered.</p><p>She moaned softly when he rolled onto his side, then sat up, drawing her with him. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s late. You need to get some sleep, and I need to feed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d His words brought reality crashing down on her. Had he been an ordinary man, she could have fixed him a sandwich, but, in this case, she was the soup de jour.</p><p>He stood, then lifted her to her feet. \u201cSee me out?\u201d</p><p>With a nod, she linked her arm with his and walked him to the door, then stood on tiptoe to kiss him good night. She was tempted to ask him to stay, to make love to her until dawn, but it didn\u2019t seem wise to take a hungry vampire to bed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He grinned at her. \u201cSmart girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill I see you tomorrow night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCount on it.\u201d He kissed her again; then, whistling softly, he walked down the porch steps and vanished into the darkness.</p> <p>\u201cI guess that\u2019s just another one of his vampire tricks,\u201d she muttered, \u201clike starting fires out of thin air and reading my mind.\u201d</p><p>In the distance, she heard the sound of his laughter.</p><p>Chapter 28</p><p>Tom\u00e1s Villagrande prowled the street below Rhys Costain\u2019s lair. The vampire wasn\u2019t home, but Tom\u00e1s wasn\u2019t interested in Costain at the moment. It was the woman, Shirl, who held his attention. Her scent tickled his nostrils and teased his desire. He had not made love to one of his own kind in years, and the idea of making love to a vampire as young and as beautiful as Costain\u2019s fledgling aroused him as nothing had in centuries.</p><p>Standing under the balcony, he called her name ever so softly, knowing that, with her preternatural power, she would hear him.</p> <p>A moment later, she appeared at the railing.</p><p>Tom\u00e1s smiled up at her. \u201cCome, take a walk with me.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. Moonlight danced in the soft waves of her long silver-blond hair. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? It\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust you.\u201d</p><p>His laughter filled the night. \u201cI mean you no harm, child.\u201d In the blink of an eye, he was on the balcony, his fingers wrapped around her wrist. \u201cAnd if I did, you couldn\u2019t stop me.\u201d</p> <p>Shirl stared at him in astonishment. She hadn\u2019t even seen him move. \u201cWhat do you want with me?\u201d</p><p>He ran his fingers through her hair. \u201cYou\u2019re incredibly lovely. I\u2019m rich and bored. To quote an old saying, I think we could make beautiful music together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, but no thanks. I\u2019m happy where I am.\u201d</p><p>He jerked his chin toward the penthouse. \u201cWith Rhys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith myself. I always work solo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the fun in that? You\u2019re a new vampire. I\u2019m an old vampire and rather jaded. I want to see the world fresh through your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure there are other new vampires who would love to go out with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you.\u201d His grip tightened on her wrist. \u201cI can show you the world. Give you anything you want. Teach you how to use your new powers. Teach you things Rhys doesn\u2019t know. Things he may never know. Why learn from one of the Indians when you can learn from the chief?\u201d He smiled as he released her wrist. Lifting her hand to his lips, he ran his tongue over her palm. \u201cI can make all your dreams come true.\u201d</p> <p>Shirl stared at him, a momentary tingle of fear spreading through every nerve and fiber of her being, but it quickly faded under the weight of his preternatural power, ancient power that wrapped itself around her and made her hungry for more.</p><p>A slow smile spread across Villagrande\u2019s face. \u201cSo,\u201d he said, placing her hand on his arm in gentlemanly fashion. \u201cShall we go?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 29</p><p>Megan had just finished dinner and was thinking about getting ready for work when the doorbell rang. She frowned on her way to answer it, wondering who it could be. She wasn\u2019t expecting anyone. Least of all, \u201cGreg!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Shirl here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Would you like to come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shoved his hands in his pockets. \u201cDo you know where I can find her? I called the hospital but they said she\u2019d checked out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t know where she is,\u201d Megan said.</p><p>Greg frowned. \u201cI thought she was sick. At death\u2019s door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was, but I guess you could say she had a rather miraculous recovery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened? Did they find a cure? Is she going to be all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really can\u2019t say, I mean...well...\u201d Megan stared at him, wishing she could just tell him the truth. \u201cAll I know is that she isn\u2019t sick anymore, and she\u2019ll probably have a nice long life.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, then said, I guess you know she broke it off with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, me too. I was hoping to change her mind. Is there someone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I know of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like she was just stringing me along,\u201d he said, his voice bitter. \u201cI should have known a girl like that would never stay with a lug like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Megan said again. She couldn\u2019t help thinking that she sounded like a parrot that only knew two words, but what else could she say? She couldn\u2019t tell Greg the truth.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI hope she\u2019ll be happy,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I bothered you.\u201d</p><p>Megan stared after him as he turned and walked away. Poor guy. With a shake of her head, she closed the door. She stood there a moment, thinking how unfair life was.</p><p>She was about to go upstairs to take a quick shower when the doorbell rang again. Thinking Greg might have returned, she opened the door.</p><p>\u201cShirl!\u201d Megan experienced a moment of fear and confusion when she saw her friend on the front porch. Clad in an off-the-shoulder white sweater and a pair of slinky black pants, Shirl looked even more exotic and exquisite than usual.</p><p>\u201cHi, Meggie,\u201d Shirl said, brushing past her. \u201cI\u2019ll only be a minute. I just came by to get my things.\u201d She tossed her handbag and coat on the sofa.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be relieved to know I\u2019m moving out.\u201d</p><p>Megan started to deny it, then decided against it. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Please, she thought, please don\u2019t let her be moving in with Rhys.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to live on a yacht.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA yacht! You know someone with a yacht? Someone willing to share it with a vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, his name is Tom\u00e1s Villagrande, and he\u2019s the most remarkable man I\u2019ve ever known. I was afraid of him when I first met him, but now...he\u2019s simply amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you said about Greg,\u201d Megan reminded her. \u201cHave you already forgotten him? He was here a few minutes ago looking for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Happiness flared in Shirl\u2019s eyes for a moment, then was quickly gone.</p><p>\u201cI thought you loved him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. I did. But he could never have given me the kind of life I wanted.\u201d Shirl paused a moment, her expression melancholy, and then she shrugged. \u201cAnd even if he could, it would never work out between us now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you said to him the last time you saw him, but he looked crushed when he left here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell him the truth, did you?\u201d Shirl asked sharply.</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Shirl said, obviously relieved. \u201cCome upstairs with me. We can talk while I pack.\u201d</p><p>Megan stared after Shirl, then followed her up the stairs. \u201cSo, who is this guy, Tom\u00e1s? What does he do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a vampire,\u201d Shirl said, an unmistakable note of excitement in her voice. \u201cThe oldest vampire in the world.\u201d She pulled a suitcase from the top shelf of her closet and started throwing clothes into it. \u201cHe\u2019s very powerful and very rich.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he know Rhys? Are they friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey know each other.\u201d Shirl moved to the dresser, quickly taking things from one drawer after another. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they\u2019re friends. Somehow, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d She pulled another suitcase from the closet and began filling it with shoes and handbags.</p><p>\u201cAre you leaving L.A.?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Tom\u00e1s says he wants a change of scene,\u201d Shirl replied airily. \u201cHe\u2019s thinking of staying here for a while.\u201d</p><p>Megan didn\u2019t know much about the intricacies of vampire politics, but she remembered reading online that there could be only one Master Vampire in the city, and right now, that was Rhys. If Tom\u00e1s was the oldest vampire in the world, was he also a Master Vampire? Did that automatically come with age? Would Rhys have to leave LA if Tom\u00e1s decided to stay? Did vampires fight over territory? The article she\u2019d read hadn\u2019t mentioned that.</p><p>Shirl closed both suitcases with a flourish, then glanced around the room. \u201cI guess that\u2019s everything but my cosmetics.\u201d She picked up a small bag and went into the bathroom.</p><p>Megan followed her, then stood in the doorway, watching as Shirl filled the bag with enough lipstick, rouge, powder, and eyeliner to last an ordinary woman a lifetime. \u201cHow do you put your makeup on when you can\u2019t see yourself in a mirror?\u201d</p><p>Shirl shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s what makeup artists are for. My agent wasn\u2019t very happy when I told him I could only work nights, but, oh, well\u2014\u201d She laughed softly. \u201cI used to worry about what I\u2019d do when I started to look older, but since I can\u2019t see my reflection anymore, that\u2019s not going to be a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have mirrors in dressing rooms,\u201d Megan said. \u201cWhat are you going to do about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t figured that out yet. But I will.\u201d</p><p>Megan grunted softly. Shirl was tall and willowy, her skin smooth and clear, her hair thick and lustrous. She would look exactly the same next year, and every year for the rest of her life. \u201cWhat are you going to do when people start to notice that your appearance never changes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can always attribute my youthful appearance to good genes and Botox. Look at Dick Clark. He looked the same for years. Anyway, Tom\u00e1s said I don\u2019t have to work unless I want to. He\u2019s going to show me the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s wonderful, I guess, but isn\u2019t all this kind of sudden?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so,\u201d Shirl replied with an airy wave of her hand, \u201cbut things are different now. He said he\u2019s going to make me his queen!\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Megan tapped her fingernails on the edge of the door. If Shirl was going to be a queen, then Tom\u00e1s must plan to be the king, but king of what? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe has big plans.\u201d Shirl glanced around the room. \u201cDo whatever you want with the rest of my stuff. Keep it, sell it, donate it to charity. Whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re happy, then?\u201d Megan asked. \u201cHappy with the way things turned out? Happy being a vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than you can imagine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t bother you...the blood part?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d She moved toward Megan. \u201cCome give me a hug. I\u2019ve got to go.\u201d</p><p>Fighting the urge to turn and run, Megan put her arms around Shirl.</p><p>\u201cMy, but you do smell good,\u201d Shirl murmured.</p><p>Megan forced herself to stay calm. She had seen enough nature films to know that running from a predator only excited them more.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d better go,\u201d Shirl said.</p><p>\u201cLet me help you with your suitcases.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly,\u201d Shirl said with a laugh. \u201cI could carry all of them, and you, down the stairs with no trouble at all.\u201d She picked up her suitcases and a couple of hat boxes and glided toward the door.</p><p>Megan followed her to the head of the stairs, then stood watching as Shirl collected her handbag and coat and walked out of the house.</p><p>Only after the door had closed behind her former best friend did Megan run downstairs to turn the lock.</p><p>\u201cHe said he\u2019s going to make her a queen?\u201d Rhys shook his head. \u201cHow the hell\u2019s he going to do that?\u201d</p> <p>Megan shrugged. \u201cHow should I know?\u201d</p><p>Rhys had picked her up after work, and now they were sitting at the bar in his club. There were only two other people in the place\u2014a man and a woman slow dancing in the middle of the room. She wondered if they were both vampires.</p><p>\u201cWhat else did she say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh, she said that I smelled good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe got that right,\u201d he said with a wry grin. \u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething about living on a yacht and staying in California...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on a minute. Villagrande\u2019s planning to stay here, in LA?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so. She said he wants a change of scene,\u201d Megan replied, and then frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s not good, is it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. Dammit!\u201d He slammed his fist on the bar top hard enough to draw the attention of the other couple, who took one look at his face and quickly went back to minding their own business.</p><p>\u201cShirl\u2019s changed,\u201d Megan said. \u201cShe seems more, I don\u2019t know, avaricious. She always liked nice things, but now...it\u2019s different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes becoming a vampire brings out the best in people, and sometimes the worst.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did it do for you?\u201d Megan asked curiously.</p><p>\u201cIt brought out the worst in me.\u201d His knuckles glided over her cheek. \u201cBut you bring out the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlatterer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d Leaning forward, he kissed her lightly. \u201cLet\u2019s go someplace where we can be alone. I want to make love to you until the sun comes up....\u201d He went suddenly still, his body tense, his eyes narrowing.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Megan asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d Taking her by the hand, he pulled her to her feet. \u201cI need to take you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRhys, what\u2019s wrong? You\u2019re scaring me.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNot now. Something\u2019s come up. I need to take care of it right away.\u201d He hurried her out to the parking lot, then thrust his keys into her hand. \u201cDo you mind driving yourself home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I guess not, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He opened the door for her, then brushed a kiss across her lips. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that was odd,\u201d Megan muttered as she watched him walk away, noting again that he seemed to just vanish into the darkness.</p><p>It took only moments for Rhys to reach Adrianna\u2019s lair. The smell of death was strong, even from a distance. As he drew closer, he caught the scent of another vampire. Villagrande.</p><p>Rhys materialized inside Adrianna\u2019s lair, a string of curses rising in his throat when he saw what was left of her. There were only a few ways to destroy a vampire\u2014a wooden stake through the heart, prolonged exposure to sunlight, beheading. And perhaps the worst and most excruciating of all\u2014fire. It was the latter method Villagrande had chosen.</p><p>Rhys shuddered as he stared at the ashes scattered across the gold-veined marble floor. By sunrise, they would be gone. He had never cared for Adrianna, and she had never liked him, but even if he had wanted to destroy her, he would never have done it like this. It was a cruel thing for one vampire to do to another, he thought, and then frowned. Had Villagrande destroyed Adrianna as an act of vengeance, or was it a warning?</p><p>Rhys stood in the center of the meeting room, his gaze moving slowly from the face of one Council member to the other.</p><p>Rupert cleared his throat. \u201cSo, she\u2019s dead? You\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>Rhys nodded. \u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see the body?\u201d Nicholas asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat was left of it.\u201d</p><p>Seth Adams swore under his breath. \u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d</p><p>Rhys began to pace the floor. \u201cI wish I knew.\u201d</p><p>Stuart Hastings glanced around the room, his expression hopeful. \u201cNow that he\u2019s settled his score with Adrianna, maybe he\u2019ll go back where he belongs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a possibility,\u201d Rhys said. \u201cOr maybe it\u2019s just the beginning.\u201d As succinctly as possible, he relayed what Megan had told him earlier.</p><p>\u201cIf he plans to make your fledgling a queen, he must plan on becoming a king,\u201d Julius remarked, looking pensive.</p><p>Winchester looked up from his cell phone, his brow furrowed. \u201cKing? King of what?\u201d</p><p>Rhys came to an abrupt halt. \u201cThat\u2019s the question, isn\u2019t it? King of what? The city? The States? The whole damn planet!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe couldn\u2019t do that, could he?\u201d Adams asked. \u201cI mean, he\u2019d have to defeat every Master Vampire in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not possible, is it?\u201d Nicholas asked. \u201cAnd if he did, where would that leave the rest of us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not paying allegiance to any king!\u201d Julius brought his fist down on the arm of his chair so hard that the wood cracked. \u201cHell,\u201d he muttered with a rueful grin, \u201cit\u2019s bad enough that I have to listen to Costain.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas laughed, then fell silent.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any answers,\u201d Rhys said. \u201cI called you here tonight to let you know what was going on and to warn you to be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are we supposed to protect ourselves?\u201d Winchester asked. \u201cNone of us are strong enough to defeat him.\u201d</p><p>Rhys shook his head. As long as humans didn\u2019t invite the Undead into their homes, they were safe behind their thresholds. Rhys didn\u2019t really understand why thresholds repelled vampires; he only knew that it worked. In a world of supernatural power, thresholds possessed a strength all their own created by the owner\u2019s sense of belonging, of love and family and shared experiences. Unfortunately, vampire thresholds had no such power. If Villagrande came calling, there was no way to keep him out.</p><p>\u201cSafety in numbers, maybe,\u201d Adams suggested. \u201cIt worked during the war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might be worth a try,\u201d Rhys said, though he didn\u2019t think the Council would go for it. Vampires were notoriously distrustful of their own kind, jealous of their hunting grounds. \u201cYou can all stay here if it\u2019ll make you feel better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Winchester asked. \u201cAre you gonna stay here with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. If Villagrande\u2019s out to take over my territory, you guys should probably stay as far away from me as you can. Maybe you should all take a vacation to the East Coast for as long as he\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want us to leave you here alone?\u201d Rupert asked.</p><p>Adams frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe needs to stay here,\u201d Julius said. \u201cHe\u2019s the only one who has a chance against Villagrande.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope.\u201d Rhys slapped his hands against his thighs. \u201cUnless anyone has anything else to say, this meeting is over.\u201d</p><p>Rhys didn\u2019t hang around to see what the members of the Council decided. He had a sudden need to see Megan, to hold her close while he still could because, unless he was badly mistaken, the preternatural crap was about to hit the fan.</p><p>Megan woke to someone quietly calling her name. She smiled as she recognized the soft, seductive voice.</p><p>\u201cRhys.\u201d She murmured his name as she sat up and turned on the light. \u201cWhat are you doing here at this time of the morning?\u201d she asked, glancing at the clock on the nightstand. \u201cIt\u2019ll be dawn soon.\u201d</p><p>He sat on the edge of the bed and slipped his arm around her waist. \u201cI needed to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>She smothered a yawn behind her hand. \u201cIs there anything I can do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this about Shirl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a way.\u201d Leaning forward, he inhaled her scent, then kissed her cheek.</p><p>\u201cRhys, you\u2019re scaring me. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat vampire your friend is tangled up with\u2014Tom\u00e1s? I think he\u2019s after my territory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to fight him for it, are you? I mean...are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sure as hell hope not.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him, her gaze searching his. \u201cYou can beat him, can\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...don\u2019t you have the same powers he does? I mean, aren\u2019t all vampires created equal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. There are a number of variables involved in becoming a vampire. The most important thing is who sired you. If you\u2019re made by one of the old ones, you automatically inherit some of his power. The longer you exist, the stronger you get, mentally and physically.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWho made you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I never knew her name, or how old she was. She found me one night and took me to her home. I didn\u2019t know what she was. She said she was going to give me a gift, and that she was going to destroy herself when the sun came up.\u201d He paused, remembering. \u201cI was young. She was beautiful. We made love all that night, and then, just before dawn, she turned me. When I woke the next night, she was gone. She left me a note telling me what I had become and what I needed to do to survive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know who made Villagrande?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. Nobody knows who made him, or how old he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s older than you?\u201d</p><p>Rhys nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnd that makes him stronger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou never told me how old you are,\u201d Megan said, momentarily distracted by Rhys\u2019s mention of age.</p><p>\u201cSure I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me you were twenty-five. Is that the truth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose to it. I was a week shy of my twenty-first birthday.\u201d</p><p>Megan groaned softy. \u201cYou\u2019re only twenty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re twenty-nine. It doesn\u2019t bother me. Don\u2019t let it bother you.\u201d</p> <p>He was right. There was no point in worrying about it, especially now. \u201cSo, you\u2019re in danger?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, as if it didn\u2019t concern him in the least, but she sensed the tension in him, knew he wasn\u2019t as confident as he wanted her to believe.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you involved in this.\u201d</p><p>Reaching up, she drew his head down and kissed him. \u201cI\u2019m already involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVillagrande is ruthless, and he plays for keeps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does he want with Shirl?\u201d</p><p>Rhys traced the curve of her cheek with the tip of one finger. \u201cWhat does any man want from a beautiful woman?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t change the subject.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what Villagrande wants. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s planning. I only know I\u2019ve got a bad feeling about the whole thing. It might be wise for us to stay apart for a while. I don\u2019t want him finding you through me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! How can you suggest that when we just got back together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMegan, I\u2019m only thinking of your safety.\u201d</p><p>With a toss of her head, she exclaimed, \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of him!\u201d</p><p>That foolish declaration scared him more than anything else. \u201cWell, I am. One more thing. I want you to change the locks on the doors first thing in the morning. If Shirl comes here again, I want you to revoke her welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why? Oh! Because she\u2019s with him now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight the first time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she can invite him inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou catch on quick, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think she\u2019d let him hurt me, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry.\u201d</p><p>Megan nodded, amazed at how quickly her life had been turned upside down yet again.</p><p>Chapter 30</p><p>Upon rising the next evening, Rhys went to his club to mull things over. He nodded at several of the regulars, noted that most of the rooms were full.</p><p>Sitting at the bar, he ordered a glass of vampire wine. He sipped it slowly, his thoughts turned inward. There was no doubt that Villagrande posed a threat, but until the other vampire made a move, Rhys didn\u2019t know how big that threat was.</p><p>If Villagrande intended to take over the West Coast, then Rhys had two options. He could stay and fight, or he could surrender and move on. The first option would most likely end in his destruction; the second would destroy his pride.</p><p>And then there was Megan. He didn\u2019t want her caught up in the middle of things. He didn\u2019t know much about Tom\u00e1s Villagrande except that he could be charming when it suited him. But the charm was only an act. Villagrande was a predator without equal, callous, cruel, and totally merciless. Adrianna was a prime example of Villagrande\u2019s ruthlessness. The fact that he would avenge himself on her over something so trivial only proved how brutal he could be.</p><p>Rhys dragged a hand over his jaw. Most vampires were coldhearted killers. Hell, he had done his share of killing in the past and would likely do so again. He was a predator. Hunting was second nature to his kind.</p><p>A deep breath filled his nostrils with Megan\u2019s scent. It clung to his clothes, his skin. Brave little mortal, he thought in amusement, declaring she wasn\u2019t afraid of Villagrande. If she knew just how cold and calculating his kind could be, she would run screaming from his presence.</p><p>Rhys drained his glass. Until he knew what Villagrande had in mind, he would stay close to Megan. He would guard her house while the sun was down, keep watch outside of Shore\u2019s whenever she was there, see that she made it safely home after work. Later tonight, before he sought his lair, he would return to her home and set wards around it to reinforce the power of the threshold.</p><p>He looked up when Veronique draped an arm over his shoulders. She was a comely young woman, with long blond hair and hazel eyes. Her slender figure was sheathed in a clingy black knit dress that left little to the imagination. If he\u2019d had a favorite among the women who came to the club, it would have been Veronique.</p><p>She smiled at him, a come hither smile that few men\u2014living or Undead\u2014could resist.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since we shared a room.\u201d She had a soft, sexy voice that conjured images of sweaty bodies entwined together. Bending down, she ran her tongue around the inside of his ear. \u201cIt\u2019s hours until dawn.\u201d</p><p>With a throaty growl, Rhys pulled her down onto his lap. He kissed her, a careless touching of his lips to hers. A kiss that meant nothing. \u201cNot tonight, my sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even a taste?\u201d she asked, pouting.</p><p>\u201cWill that make you happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make me happy, mon coeur. I\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>Rhys shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ve been busy.\u201d</p><p>She knew better than to question him. Instead, she lifted her hair from her neck, then tilted her head to the side in silent invitation.</p><p>And because he was fond of her, because he was thirsty, he lowered his head and took what she so freely offered.</p><p>Chapter 31</p><p>Shirl ran alongside Tom\u00e1s, thrilling to the speed and power of her new body. When he jumped over an eight-foot fence, she followed him effortlessly. When he scurried up the side of a building as agile as a spider, she did likewise. When he jumped from the roof of the building to the one across the alley, she leaped after him, laughing as she did so. There was nothing to be afraid of. She was practically indestructible. Her headaches had disappeared. She was never tired. She had the strength of twenty men. Every sense was clearer, sharper. Oh, yes, she loved being a vampire. It was like being Wonder Woman, Superwoman, and Catwoman, all rolled into one.</p><p>Of course, there were times when she missed her favorite foods, when she yearned to bask in the sun, but Tom\u00e1s had assured her that her longing for such things would lessen with each passing night until they ceased to matter at all. And she believed him.</p><p>Tom\u00e1s jumped from the roof to the street below and once again, Shirl followed him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve worked up an appetite,\u201d he remarked. \u201cHow about you?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, anticipation rising at the thought of hunting the night. It was exciting, searching for prey, chasing them down, feeling their fear, listening to the frantic beating of their hearts as they pleaded for help, for mercy. Tom\u00e1s was a merciless hunter. He never left his prey alive.</p><p>Shirl hadn\u2019t yet taken a life. She had been tempted, but she couldn\u2019t quite bring herself to do it. But she would, because Tom\u00e1s expected it of her.</p><p>The beaches along the coast were his favorite hunting grounds, not only because he loved the sea, but because the ocean made it easy to dispose of the bodies if he was so inclined. They had hunted Manhattan Beach, Marina Del Ray, Laguna, Venice, and Santa Monica. Tonight, he took her to the Hermosa Pier. It was a popular night spot due to its many restaurants, bars, and nightclubs. There were usually long lines on the weekends. Shirl had been a frequent visitor in the past, and she hadn\u2019t been above using her celebrity to get to the head of the line.</p><p>It took only moments to get from the city to the beach. Tom\u00e1s agreed to spend a few minutes walking along the shore before they went in search of prey.</p><p>After removing her shoes, Shirl waded into the water. She had always loved the beach, the feel of the warm sand between her toes, the whisper of the waves rolling in. Now, with her heightened senses, it was even better. She laughed softly as the waves lapped at her ankles. The air was filled with the bouquet of sand and salt and seaweed. The evening breeze caressed her cheeks and danced in her hair.</p><p>She paused as a whiff of prey chased everything else from her mind.</p><p>Tom\u00e1s had smelled it, too. A man and a woman were stretched out on a blanket just a few yards away, so wrapped up in each other they were unaware that they were no longer alone on the beach.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll race you!\u201d Shirl cried, and took off running.</p><p>In spite of her head start, Tom\u00e1s beat her. He was already bent over the woman\u2019s neck when Shirl reached the blanket.</p><p>She smiled down at the man, who was looking on in horror. Mesmerized by Tom\u00e1s, the man was unable to move.</p><p>His eyes grew wide with fear when Shirl lifted him to his feet as though he weighed no more than a child.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid,\u201d she cooed. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you.\u201d And so saying, she gathered him into her arms, the hunger pounding through every fiber of her being in time to the frantic beat of his heart.</p><p>Looking over the man\u2019s head, she smiled at Tom\u00e1s.</p><p>\u201cTake him,\u201d Tom\u00e1s said. \u201cYou\u2019ll never know what it\u2019s truly like to be a vampire until you\u2019ve made your first kill.\u201d</p><p>Shirl licked her lips. The urge to drain her victims dry was always there when she fed, but so far, she hadn\u2019t succumbed to it. She wasn\u2019t sure why, but it was a line she was reluctant to cross. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you a vampire or not?\u201d Tom\u00e1s challenged. \u201cSooner or later, you have to let go of your old notions of right and wrong. You\u2019re a predator now. He\u2019s prey. Take him!\u201d</p><p>Shirl gazed into the frightened eyes of the man caught in the web of her embrace. She knew Tom\u00e1s was watching her. How could she disappoint him again?</p><p>Experiencing a moment of regret, she smoothed the man\u2019s hair from his brow, then glanced at the woman on the blanket. Was she his girlfriend? His wife? Did they have children waiting for them at home? Feeling the weight of Tom\u00e1s\u2019s gaze, she thrust the troubling questions from her mind.</p> <p>After a murmured, \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she lowered her head, sank her fangs into the man\u2019s neck, and drank.</p><p>It was intoxicating, the taste of his blood, the thrill of power that moved through her as she subdued his struggles with her superior strength.</p><p>Chapter 32</p><p>Rhys didn\u2019t have to wait long to discover Villagrande\u2019s intentions. He had spent the evening with Megan, kissed her good night, and tucked her into bed a little after 1 A.M. He was outside, taking a turn around the house, when his cell phone rang.</p><p>\u201cCostain? It\u2019s Nicholas. Winchester has been destroyed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWinchester wanted to watch the football game tonight, so the two of us went to his place. We were playing poker later when Villagrande showed up. He destroyed Winchester before I realized what was happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe needed a messenger boy. He told me to tell you he\u2019s taking over the West Coast. He said you can either swear allegiance to him or he\u2019s going to destroy the rest of us, one by one. And then you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the rest of the Council?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere, at the meeting house. We\u2019re all here. What are you going to do about Villagrande?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wish I knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of us are strong enough to take him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Have you told the others what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. I called you first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do with the body?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI left it where it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStay there until you hear from me. No one\u2019s to leave the house, understood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t say anything until I get there.\u201d Muttering an oath, Rhys ended the call. He lingered on the porch for several minutes, his brow furrowed. He needed to dispose of Winchester\u2019s body, and then he should probably meet with the Council members and let them know what was going on.</p><p>\u201cDammit!\u201d Rhys dragged a hand through his hair. He had to decide what he was going to do. Villagrande had laid down an unmistakable challenge, and it was up to Rhys to answer it.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s it gonna be?\u201d he muttered. \u201cStay and fight? Or tuck your tail between your legs and run like a damn dog?\u201d</p><p>He grunted softly. Why hadn\u2019t he thought of it before? There was a third option, and one he might have to use if things got any worse.</p><p>Chapter 33</p><p>Erik Delacourt frowned when his cell phone rang. When he read the time, he knew it couldn\u2019t be good news.</p><p>Daisy looked up from the book she was reading, a question in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Rhys.\u201d Erik mouthed the words before he answered the phone. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m having a little trouble with Villagrande,\u201d Rhys said. \u201cI could use some backup from someone I can trust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVillagrande!\u201d Erik exclaimed. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s after the West Coast.\u201d</p><p>Erik uttered a short, pithy curse. \u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe killings across the country?\u201d Erik asked. \u201cWere they...?</p><p>\u201cYeah. You\u2019re lucky he didn\u2019t get hungry in Boston. He made his way here one body at a time. Earlier tonight, he killed a Council member.\u201d Rhys didn\u2019t mention Adrianna. That feud had been between her and Villagrande, and Villagrande had the right to settle it as he saw fit, even if Rhys disagreed with his methods.</p><p>Erik swore again. \u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now I\u2019m only concerned about one thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that would be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA woman.\u201d</p><p>Erik stared at the phone, wondering if he\u2019d heard right. \u201cA woman? You mean, a mortal woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she in danger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I don\u2019t want to take any chances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe means a lot to you.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a question. And Rhys didn\u2019t answer. \u201cI was wondering if you\u2019d come and work some of your black magick on her house. I\u2019m not sure a threshold, even one I\u2019ve warded, is strong enough to keep Villagrande out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think it\u2019ll come to a fight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sure as hell hope not. I don\u2019t think I could take him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be there first thing tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I\u2019ll owe you one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Erik said, chuckling. \u201cLet\u2019s just hope you\u2019re around to pay up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was that all about?\u201d Daisy asked after he ended the call.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember Tom\u00e1s Villagrande?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could I forget him?\u201d</p><p>Erik grunted softly. Not so long ago, Villagrande had kidnapped Daisy\u2019s father and brother. He remembered it as if it had happened yesterday. He had tracked Daisy\u2019s father and brother to Villagrande\u2019s yacht....</p><p>Going below, Erik followed the vampire\u2019s scent into a stateroom where he found the two O\u2019Donnell men lying on the floor, bound and apparently under some kind of preternatural enchantment. He was moving toward them when he realized he was no longer alone.</p><p>Erik whirled around, fangs extended, and came face-to-face with one of his kind. Clad in a pair of black trousers and a loose-fitting white shirt, the vampire was tall and lean and looked to be in his late twenties, though his aura was much older.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d the vampire asked. His voice was mild, though his eyes blazed red.</p><p>\u201cI know these two,\u201d Erik said, gesturing at Daisy\u2019s father and brother. \u201cThey\u2019re not to be harmed.\u201d</p><p>The other vampire lifted one brow. \u201cIndeed?\u201d</p><p>Erik nodded.</p><p>\u201cThey violated my lair. They tried to destroy me. I am within my rights to do with them as it pleases me. And it pleases me to kill them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t allow you to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo? Who are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cErik Delacourt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know me?\u201d Erik asked.</p><p>\u201cI have heard of you. It is said you are a close friend of Costain\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Erik nodded, wondering if that was good or bad. \u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTom\u00e1s Villagrande.\u201d</p><p>Erik swore under his breath. Villagrande was the Master of the East Coast Vampires, and was even older than Rhys. It was rumored among the ranks of the Undead that Villagrande had been one of the first of their kind, that it was Villagrande who had bequeathed the Dark Gift to Dracula himself. Erik didn\u2019t know if that was true, but Villagrande\u2019s preternatural power was unmistakable.</p><p>Villagrande folded his arms over his chest. \u201cWhy do you care if these two live or die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re related to someone I hold dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat does change things, does it not?\u201d Villagrande mused aloud. \u201cAnd yet the fact remains that they are mine.\u201d</p><p>Tension thrummed through Erik as he summoned his power. If the other vampire wanted a fight, so be it, although pitting his strength against that of a much older vampire seemed like suicide.</p><p>\u201cThis someone you hold dear, is it a woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. And is she young and beautiful beyond compare?\u201d</p><p>Erik nodded even as he wondered what game Villagrande was playing.</p><p>\u201cYou are in love with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn overrated emotion to be sure,\u201d Villagrande remarked, his voice melancholy. \u201cYet I confess that I, too, have been caught in that snare from time to time. Tell me, are you willing to challenge me in combat to save these two?\u201d</p><p>Erik swore inwardly. He had hoped it wouldn\u2019t come to that, but he couldn\u2019t go back to Daisy and tell her he had failed. Better not to return at all. \u201cIf I have to.\u201d</p><p>Villagrande stroked his chin as he contemplated Erik\u2019s decision. \u201cShe means that much to you, this woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd more.\u201d</p><p>Villagrande laughed softly. \u201cI do not wish to kill you. You have trouble enough. Take them and go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like that.\u201d Villagrande smiled, showing a hint of fang. \u201cNever let it be said that Tom\u00e1s Villagrande stood in the way of true love. As for your inept friends here, I am surprised they have survived as long as they have. They should wake in half an hour or so. You might tell them to be more careful in the future,\u201d he said, and with a wave of his hand, he vanished.</p><p>\u201cSo, what did Rhys have to say?\u201d Daisy asked.</p><p>\u201cIt seems Villagrande is planning a takeover of the West Coast,\u201d Erik replied, and quickly relayed what Rhys had told him over the phone.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that about a woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think our Mr. Costain has fallen in love,\u201d Erik said with a grin.</p><p>\u201cNo way!\u201d</p><p>Erik nodded. \u201cI think he\u2019s in love big-time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, we\u2019re going to California?\u201d Daisy remarked.</p><p>\u201cLooks that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait. I\u2019m anxious to meet the woman who finally captured his heart. And maybe,\u201d she said, her eyes twinkling, \u201cwe\u2019ll even find time for a midnight stroll on the beach.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter 34</p><p>\u201cRhys!\u201d Megan pressed a hand to her heart. She hadn\u2019t anticipated finding him waiting for her in the garage. \u201cWhat are you doing here? I didn\u2019t expect to see you until later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d drive you to work tonight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to take your car. I left mine at home.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him curiously. He wore a black long-sleeved shirt over a white T-shirt, black jeans, and boots. His hair gleamed like dark gold in the glow of the overhead light. Dark and dangerous, she thought, no doubt about it. \u201cWhat aren\u2019t you telling me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVillagrande\u2019s on the rampage again. He killed one of my vampires earlier tonight. It isn\u2019t safe for you to be alone outside of your house.\u201d He paused a moment, then decided she needed to know it all. \u201cAnd maybe not inside.\u201d</p><p>Megan felt a cold chill at the mention of Villagrande\u2019s name. She had told Rhys she wasn\u2019t afraid of the other vampire, but it had been nothing but bravado.</p> <p>Rhys opened the passenger door for her, and she got into the car. She had once thought her life completely boring. And then she met Rhys.</p><p>He slid behind the wheel, switched on the engine and the lights, hit the garage door opener, and backed out of the driveway. \u201cHave you heard from Shirl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Do you think she knows what Villagrande is planning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d He pulled onto the street.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should just stay home tonight,\u201d Megan suggested, and hated how cowardly that sounded. And yet, she didn\u2019t have the physical strength to fight off a vampire, even if she knew how. She didn\u2019t have any super powers. And she was pretty sure a can of pepper spray wouldn\u2019t be much of a deterrent.</p><p>Rhys slowed the car. \u201cDo you want to go back home?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. No. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s up to you.\u201d</p><p>Megan tapped her foot on the floorboard, then blew out a sigh. \u201cMr. Parker\u2019s expecting me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my brave girl,\u201d Rhys murmured, and hoped neither of them would regret it.</p><p>Things were quiet at the store that night. Megan was ever aware that Rhys was just outside, watching her every move. She assured herself she was perfectly safe, that Rhys wouldn\u2019t let any harm come to her, and yet she felt herself tensing every time a man she didn\u2019t recognize entered the shop.</p><p>She was relieved when quitting time came.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she asked when they were in the car on the way home, \u201cwhat are you going to do about Villagrande?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve called in some outside help.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally? Who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cErik Delacourt and his wife, Daisy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they vampires, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Delacourt and I go back a long way. His wife\u2019s only been a vampire a short time.\u201d He grunted softly. \u201cShe used to steal vampire blood and sell it on the Net. Her brothers were hunters. The younger one was killed by a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she still wanted to be one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly. I destroyed the last vampire who wanted to take over the city. Mariah wasn\u2019t nearly as strong as Villagrande, or as up front about it. She offered a reward for my head. I took hers instead. Delacourt, Daisy, and her brother, Alex, all had a hand in it. Apparently Mariah had a boyfriend. He went after Daisy and almost killed her. Delacourt brought her across to save her life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t really life,\u201d Megan murmured, then bit her tongue, hoping she hadn\u2019t hurt his feelings.</p><p>\u201cMaybe not, but she seems damn happy with the way things turned out. I think you\u2019ll like her.\u201d</p><p>Megan shook her head. Not long ago, she hadn\u2019t believed vampires existed. How times had changed. Her former roommate was a vampire. She was in love with a vampire. And now she was going to meet two more, and possibly one that wanted to kill her.</p><p>Suddenly, her old, boring life didn\u2019t seem half so bad.</p><p>And when Rhys showed up at her door the next night with two vampires in tow, Megan began to wonder if her life would ever be normal again.</p><p>Erik Delacourt was long-legged and broad-shouldered. He could have been the poster boy for vampires, she mused, with his thick black hair and striking black eyes. He appeared to be in his thirties, but with vampires, you never knew how old they really were. His wife, Daisy, looked like she was in her midtwenties. She had heavily lashed green eyes and long, reddish-brown hair. Megan thought she looked more like a country girl than a former Blood Thief turned vampire.</p><p>Megan invited the newcomers into the house. After Rhys made the introductions, Erik and Daisy sat on the love seat, holding hands, while Megan and Rhys shared the sofa.</p><p>One thing about vampire guests, Megan thought as she tried to relax, she didn\u2019t have to worry about offering them refreshments. And then she grimaced because, among less friendly vampires, she would have been considered the snack.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we should have had this meeting somewhere else,\u201d Daisy said quietly. \u201cI don\u2019t think Megan\u2019s very comfortable, having us here.\u201d</p><p>At Daisy\u2019s remark, Rhys ran his knuckles lightly over Megan\u2019s cheek. \u201cDo you want us to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not,\u201d she said quickly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve nothing to fear from us,\u201d Erik assured her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried,\u201d Megan said, surprised to find that it was true.</p><p>\u201cRhys has asked me to come here and use my witchcraft to add a protective spell to your house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a witch, too?\u201d Megan asked, unable to hide her astonishment. Mortals and vampires and witches. Oh, my.</p><p>Erik nodded, his eyes twinkling with amusement.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of spell?\u201d Megan asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing too complicated. It will repel any unwelcome visitors from entering your house. And since I don\u2019t know how powerful Villagrande is, it will also keep him from materializing inside, uninvited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure it will work?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cGuaranteed. Of course, I won\u2019t do it without your permission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got it.\u201d</p><p>Erik smiled at her. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of it later tonight.\u201d</p><p>Megan nodded. At this point, she would take all the protection she could get. Since vampires were real, who knew what other mythological creatures might be stalking the shadows?</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Erik said to Rhys, \u201cdo you have any plans for besting this interloper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. You\u2019ve met him. Do you think I\u2019ve got a chance against him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve felt his power, and it\u2019s stronger than anything I\u2019ve ever come up against. I guess it all depends on how badly you want to remain Master of the City.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Rhys muttered. \u201cThat\u2019s the real question, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just leave?\u201d Daisy asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s so special about LA?\u201d</p><p>Erik and Rhys exchanged glances.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than that,\u201d Rhys said. \u201cIf I leave, it\u2019s like admitting I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with being afraid?\u201d Megan asked.</p><p>Erik and Rhys exchanged glances again.</p><p>Megan looked at Daisy. \u201cMen,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re all the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it,\u201d Daisy said, grinning. \u201cMan or vampire, it doesn\u2019t matter. You should meet my brother, Alex. He\u2019s Mr. Macho personified.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just about male pride,\u201d Rhys said irritably. \u201cIn the human world, it doesn\u2019t make much of a difference if you\u2019re a coward. In my world, it\u2019s a sign of weakness, and like the song says, only the strong survive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that settles it, then,\u201d Erik said. \u201cIf he wants a fight, we\u2019ll give it to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no \u2018we,\u2019\u201d Rhys said emphatically. \u201cI only asked you here to help fortify Megan\u2019s house.\u201d He took Megan\u2019s hand in his. \u201cAnd to look after her, if anything happens to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that!\u201d Megan exclaimed. \u201cNothing\u2019s going to happen to you.\u201d</p><p>Rhys squeezed her hand. \u201cI hope not, but I have to know you\u2019ll be okay, just in case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a spell that might protect her,\u201d Erik remarked.</p><p>\u201cAre you talking about the same one you used against me?\u201d Rhys asked. It had been the first time since he\u2019d become a vampire that his powers had failed him. He didn\u2019t know what kind of spell Erik had concocted, but it had seemed as if an invisible barrier had surrounded him, trapping him inside. If Erik had wanted to take his life, Rhys wouldn\u2019t have been able to stop him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the same type of spell, but instead of rendering Megan helpless and immobile, it would repel Villagrande\u2019s power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it will protect me, you should use it on Rhys, too,\u201d Megan said.</p><p>\u201cProbably wouldn\u2019t hurt,\u201d Erik said. \u201cOf course, I\u2019d have to beef it up for it to work against Villagrande.\u201d</p><p>Rhys shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re not using it on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Megan asked.</p><p>\u201cThe odds of beating Villagrande in a fair fight are pretty slim,\u201d Erik remarked. \u201cBut you know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I know it! Dammit!\u201d Rhys raked his fingers through his hair.</p><p>\u201cHonor among vampires? Is that it?\u201d Megan asked in disbelief. \u201cVillagrande wants to kill you. You said yourself he\u2019s stronger than you are. What have you got against leveling the playing field, so to speak?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s cheating. No one on the Council is going to respect me if they find out I used black magick to immobilize my enemy so I could destroy him.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s like shooting him in the back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a good idea to me,\u201d Daisy muttered.</p><p>\u201cI guess it would, to a former hunter,\u201d Erik said good-naturedly.</p><p>\u201cHold on a minute!\u201d Megan said. \u201cI don\u2019t mind your working your hocus pocus on my house, but I don\u2019t think I want anybody working black magick on me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t black magick,\u201d Erik said. \u201cJust a little witchcraft.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head emphatically. \u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMegan, my love,\u201d Rhys said, \u201cdon\u2019t be stubborn.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d she retorted. \u201cYou are.\u201d</p><p>Rhys blew out an exasperated sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s different with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, you two,\u201d Erik said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t getting us anywhere. We can take the matter up again tomorrow. I\u2019ll go out and put the wards on the house, and then I need to find a place where Daisy and I can spend the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can stay in my penthouse, if you like,\u201d Rhys offered. \u201cI\u2019ll be staying here.\u201d</p><p>Megan looked at him, obviously surprised by this bit of news, but she didn\u2019t object.</p> <p>Erik nodded. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Rising, Rhys pulled Megan to her feet. \u201cI\u2019m going to go let them in, and then I\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>Rhys drew her into his arms and kissed her soundly, then kissed her again, more tenderly. \u201cI won\u2019t be gone long.\u201d</p> <p>He followed Erik and Daisy outside, stood with Daisy while Erik cast a protective spell around the house. Supernatural power electrified the air. Rhys swore softly as it danced over his skin like thousands of tiny shocks, raising the short hairs along his arms and the back of his neck.</p><p>\u201cThat spell we talked about for Megan,\u201d Rhys said when Erik finished casting the protective wards on Megan\u2019s house. \u201cCan you work it on her without her knowing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, that won\u2019t be a problem. The only thing is, I don\u2019t know if I can make it strong enough to repel Villagrande.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust do your best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Megan said...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind what she said. Just do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. I\u2019ll come back and take care of it later tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Guess I owe you another one.\u201d</p> <p>It took only minutes for the three of them to transport themselves to Rhys\u2019s penthouse. Rhys let Erik and Daisy in, invited them to make themselves at home, then quickly returned to Megan\u2019s. She opened the door before he rang the bell.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d he demanded angrily. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlood bond,\u201d she reminded him with a saucy grin. \u201cI knew it was you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink you\u2019re pretty smart, don\u2019t you?\u201d he muttered as he closed and locked the door.</p><p>She stood on her tiptoes, pulled his head down, and kissed him. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be morning soon,\u201d she said, nipping at his lower lip. \u201cDo you want to stand here and argue until dawn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Swinging her into his arms, he carried her swiftly up the stairs and down the hall to her bedroom. \u201cI think I can find a better way to pass the time.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 35</p><p>\u201cWhat about Megan?\u201d Shirl asked as she slid under the covers beside Tom\u00e1s. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to her?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged negligently. \u201cI have no quarrel with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s in love with Rhys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s unfortunate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why you want to rule the West Coast,\u201d Shirl said, frowning. \u201cI\u2019d be perfectly happy to live in New York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll understand, in time.\u201d Villagrande stroked her hair, a faraway look in his eyes. \u201cWhen you live for hundreds of years, you can\u2019t help becoming bored now and then. I\u2019ve grown weary of the East, so I\u2019ve decided to stay here a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why does Rhys have to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaster Vampires don\u2019t share their territory.\u201d</p><p>She considered that a moment before asking, \u201cWhat if he won\u2019t leave?\u201d</p><p>The sudden narrowing of Villagrande\u2019s eyes gave her all the answer she needed.</p><p>Shirl rested her head on his shoulder. She was intrigued by Tom\u00e1s, awed by his power, addicted to his lovemaking. He had taught her much about being a vampire in the last few days, had regaled her with stories of his past. He had traveled the world many times, seen everything there was to see. It was almost impossible to comprehend just how old he was. He wasn\u2019t sure exactly when he was born, but he had known ancient kings and queens, fought in many battles in many countries, both on land and sea, visited America before the white man came.</p><p>Living with him was exhilarating, fascinating. And a little frightening. He had been a vampire for so long, he seemed to have forgotten that he had once been human. After eons of being a vampire, he viewed mankind as nothing more than prey, to do with as he wished. He drank from the males. Dallied with the females. Sometimes he toyed with them before taking them. But he always killed them in the end.</p><p>She had disappointed him the other night. He had urged her to make her first kill, and even though she had wanted to please him, she hadn\u2019t been able to do it. The fact that he killed indiscriminately frightened her. Would she one day be as cold and callous as he was? He had no friends that she knew of. He had lived alone on his fancy yacht for decades before she met him. Thinking of friends brought Megan to mind again. Though she refused to admit it, she missed Megan\u2019s friendship more than she would have thought possible.</p><p>Thoughts of Megan faded into the distance when Tom\u00e1s reached for her. Shirl had been intimate with only two men in her lifetime, but they both paled beside him. She wondered how many other women he had loved.</p><p>She had asked him once, and he had laughed. It was the first time she had heard him laugh with such open amusement. When she had insisted on knowing what was so funny, he had patted her on the head as if she were a little girl who had asked a silly question.</p><p>\u201cAh, my sweet innocent,\u201d he had replied, still grinning. \u201cDo you really expect me to remember after so many years?\u201d</p><p>Now, as his hands moved masterfully over her body, she didn\u2019t care if he had made love to one woman or a million. It didn\u2019t matter. Nothing mattered but the touch of his hands deftly arousing her, the painful pleasure of his fangs against her skin, the unequaled delight of his flesh melding with hers.</p><p>She clung to him, never more vitally alive than when Tom\u00e1s made love to her. With her enhanced senses, she was acutely aware of everything around her\u2014the tangy scent of the salt air, the gentle rocking of the boat, the sound of waves lapping against the hull. But, most of all, she was aware of the man who brought her to fulfillment again and again before the rising sun chased the moon and stars from the sky.</p><p>Chapter 36</p><p>When Megan woke in the morning, she was alone in bed. She frowned, wondering when Rhys had left, and where he had gone. After inviting Daisy and Erik to stay at his penthouse, Rhys had indicated he would be spending the day at her place. Had he changed his mind and decided to go home?</p><p>Sitting up, she hugged Rhys\u2019s pillow to her chest, then buried her face in its softness, inhaling his unique scent. He had never stayed over. Why not, she wondered, then shook her head. How could she be so obtuse? He obviously didn\u2019t want her to see him while he was at rest. She wondered if there was some kind of vampire law that prohibited vampires from spending the daylight hours with mortals? She shook her head. That sounded preposterous, even to her. So, what reason could there be? Was it because he looked dead when he slept?</p><p>The thought made her shudder. She hadn\u2019t given much thought to that part of being a vampire. She knew they took their rest during the day, but she had assumed they slept like everyone else. Did he dream?</p><p>Did he wear pajamas? Somehow, she didn\u2019t think so, but if he did, she was certain it would be bottoms only. Black silk.</p><p>Did he sleep in a coffin? She had been to his penthouse, seen his bedroom. No sign of a coffin there, but that didn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t have one stashed away somewhere else.</p><p>Shaking off her morbid thoughts, she went into the bathroom to shower and get dressed.</p><p>Megan had just finished breakfast when a delivery man arrived with a single, perfect red rose in a smoked crystal bud vase. She didn\u2019t have to read the card to know it was from Rhys, but of course, she read it anyway. It said simply, \u201cI love you. RC.\u201d</p><p>An hour later, another delivery man showed up on her doorstep bearing two red roses in a blown glass vase with a card that said, \u201cI\u2019m counting the hours until I can see you again. RC.\u201d</p><p>She received four red roses and a heart-shaped balloon an hour later. The note said, \u201cI\u2019m thinking of you. RC.\u201d</p><p>She was waiting at the door when the next delivery arrived. Eight perfect red roses in an elegant silver vase, and a heart-shaped box of Belgian dark chocolates. The note said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to kiss the chocolate off your lips. RC.\u201d</p><p>An hour later, she received sixteen long-stemmed blood red roses in a Waterford crystal vase. The card read, \u201cSee you soon, my love. RC.\u201d</p><p>Whether she was changing the sheets on her bed or mopping the kitchen floor, Megan couldn\u2019t stop smiling. He loved her. She laughed softly as she stuffed a load of towels into the dryer. Sure, he was a vampire, but no relationship was perfect. They still had a lot of issues to discuss and decide, but she was confident they could work things out. And if they couldn\u2019t...? She shook her doubts aside, determined to ignore the negative and focus on the positive.</p><p>Megan had just finished clearing the dinner dishes when the doorbell rang. She glanced around the living room as she went to answer the door, thinking the room looked like a florist shop that specialized in exquisite red roses.</p><p>She smiled as she started to open the door and then, without knowing why, she hesitated, her hand on the latch. \u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me, Shirl. Why won\u2019t my key work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI changed the lock,\u201d Megan said, and then, taking a deep breath, she added, \u201cYou\u2019re not welcome here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeggie, what are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but you can\u2019t come in.\u201d Megan closed her eyes against a sudden rush of tears. Shirl had been her best friend for years. And then she frowned, certain that Shirl wasn\u2019t alone. She could almost taste the preternatural power coming from the other side of the door, power far too strong to belong to a fledgling vampire. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMeggie, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re doing this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you alone?\u201d</p><p>There was a brief pause before Shirl said, \u201cOf course I\u2019m alone.\u201d</p> <p>A peek through the peephole showed that Shirl was lying. A tall man clad in a dark green shirt, brown pants, and boots stood off to the side.</p><p>\u201cVillagrande.\u201d The name whispered past Megan\u2019s lips. According to Rhys, Villagrande was the oldest vampire in the world. What was he doing here?</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d His voice was deep, tinged with an accent Megan didn\u2019t recognize</p><p>She took a step backward, discomfited by the knowledge that he had heard her murmur his name. Taking a deep breath, she looked through the peephole again, watched as he reached for the door handle. What was he doing? He couldn\u2019t enter without an invitation. Could he? Maybe the rules no longer applied when a vampire was as old as he was.</p><p>She waited, hardly daring to breathe, as his hand curled around the doorknob.</p> <p>There was a flash of bright white light, a crackle like static electricity, followed by a sharp curse from Villagrande.</p><p>Megan recoiled. And then she grinned. It was obvious that whatever magical whammy Erik Delacourt had placed around her house was working perfectly.</p><p>Her grin faded as quickly as it had come. Rhys would be arriving soon to take her to work. What would happen if he showed up while Villagrande was still there? Would they battle it out on her front porch?</p><p>When she looked through the peephole again, Shirl and Villagrande were nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Rhys swore softly when Megan told him what had happened with Shirl earlier that evening.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think he came here?\u201d It was a question she was reluctant to ask because she was sure she wouldn\u2019t like the answer.</p> <p>\u201cCould be a lot of reasons,\u201d Rhys said. \u201cMaybe he just wanted to see where you live. Maybe he was looking for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou left out the most logical reason,\u201d Megan said. \u201cThat he wanted to use me to get to you.\u201d</p><p>Rhys nodded. He hadn\u2019t wanted to suggest that, but he should have known Megan was smart enough to reach that conclusion on her own. Just as surely as there was crap and corruption in Washington, he was sure that had been Villagrande\u2019s motive.</p><p>\u201cAt least Erik\u2019s magick spell worked,\u201d Megan said, looking on the bright side. \u201cYou should have seen the way Villagrande jumped when he tried to open the door. It was almost comical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Sorry I missed that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you spend the day?\u201d she asked, unable to stay her curiosity any longer.</p><p>\u201cAt my club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you stay here?\u201d</p> <p>The wary look in his eyes warned her not to pursue the subject, making her think she had guessed right earlier. He didn\u2019t want her to see him when he was at rest. But why?</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she asked, going back to their original conversation, \u201cwhat do we do now?\u201d She tried to keep her voice even, but she wasn\u2019t completely successful.</p><p>Rhys was tempted to take Megan to his lair, but in the long run, he thought she would be safer here. He was about to tell her so when his cell rang. He answered it with a curt, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d Rupert said, his voice equally curt. \u201cThe meeting house is on fire. I\u2019m afraid Adams didn\u2019t make it out. I think he was the only casualty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe scattered. I\u2019m in Phoenix. I don\u2019t know where the others have gone.\u201d</p><p>Rhys swore softly. He had told the Council to stay together, thinking there would be safety in numbers. He didn\u2019t often make mistakes, but he\u2019d miscalculated badly this time.</p><p>\u201cI want you to get in touch with the others,\u201d Rhys said. \u201cTell them to head for the Midwest. When you get there, get in touch with Volger. Tell him I\u2019m calling in the favor he owes me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVolger, right. What are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Just do as I say. I\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d Rhys disconnected the call without waiting for a reply.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Megan asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVillagrande burned down a house I own. One of my vampires was destroyed in the blaze.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d Shivering, Megan wrapped her arms around her waist. Being burned alive had to be the most horrible way to die. Thinking about the vampire who had perished in the fire brought back the horror of the inferno at Drexel\u2019s concert and reminded her of how lucky she was to still be alive.</p><p>\u201cI need to go check out the house,\u201d Rhys said. \u201cMake sure Adams was the only casualty.\u201d</p><p>Megan looked up at him, her gaze searching his face. \u201cDo you think that\u2019s a good idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not, but I\u2019m going anyway. You stay here. Keep the door locked. Don\u2019t talk to anyone. Don\u2019t let anyone but me inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her, hard and quick, and then he was gone amidst a flurry of sparkling silver motes.</p><p>Megan shook her head. Just when she thought she had seen all his spooky tricks, he did something totally unexpected.</p><p>Rhys materialized at the end of the street. The fire department was still at the scene. The acrid stink of burnt wood and smoke hung heavy in the air, along with a smell that Rhys recognized as vampire remains.</p><p>He made his way closer to the house, mingling with a handful of curious neighbors. Standing there, he listened to the conversations around him.</p><p>\u201cWe never saw anybody in the house,\u201d a man remarked to one of the firemen. \u201cAnd we never saw any lights....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we did,\u201d the woman said. \u201cBut it flickered, you know, like candlelight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right,\u201d the man agreed, as if it wasn\u2019t very important. \u201cWe never saw anybody around during the day, though. If it wasn\u2019t for the cars we saw parked in the driveway now and then, and the fact that a gardener came to mow the lawn, we would have thought the house was haunted....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonder how it started...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never saw a house go up so fast,\u201d muttered a tall, dark-haired man clad in gray sweatpants. \u201cYou\u2019d have thought it was made out of flash paper. Strangest thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>A woman holding a baby nodded. \u201cWhoosh!\u201d she said. \u201cJust like that, it was gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard a scream,\u201d said an elderly woman in a bright pink bathrobe. \u201cIt was horrible. Gave me the shivers, it did.\u201d</p><p>When the firemen started packing up, Rhys went around to the back of the house. Closing his eyes, he opened his senses. Adams had died in the hallway. There was no way to tell if Adams had been destroyed by Villagrande or by the flames, but he was the only casualty. Villagrande\u2019s scent was strong here in the backyard. And Shirl\u2019s, too. Had she participated in starting the fire, or had she merely been an observer? Not that it mattered. As far as Rhys was concerned, she was equally culpable in Adams\u2019s destruction.</p><p>Sifting through the ashes, he found himself wondering what type of incendiary material Villagrande had used to start the fire. It was obvious that the blaze had burned hot and fast. The only thing left intact was a small portion of the brick fireplace. Rhys muttered an oath as he dusted off his hands. Either someone had stolen the sword he had kept over the fireplace, or it, too, had perished in the blaze.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Rhys slid a glance at the vampire who had materialized beside him. \u201cVillagrande happened.\u201d</p><p>Erik\u2019s gaze swept over what was left of the house. \u201cHe\u2019s not fooling around, is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know I was here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe went by Megan\u2019s. She wouldn\u2019t let us in, and she wouldn\u2019t talk to us. I left Daisy there to keep watch while I followed your scent here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of my vampires perished in the fire. That\u2019s three of mine he\u2019s destroyed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to keep pushing until you quit the field or you agree to meet with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was at Megan\u2019s earlier tonight. Shirl tried to get her to open the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe plays dirty, Rhys. You know that.\u201d</p><p>Rhys nodded. Foolish as it seemed, he had expected better from the oldest vampire in the world. Then again, maybe playing dirty was how you survived long enough to become the oldest vampire in the world.</p><p>\u201cYou know you can\u2019t beat him on your own,\u201d Erik said quietly.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve already had this discussion,\u201d Rhys said curtly. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more to be done here. I\u2019m going back to Megan\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Without waiting for a reply, he dissolved into mist.</p><p>Erik was right behind him.</p><p>Daisy was waiting for them on the front porch of Megan\u2019s house. Erik kissed his wife on the cheek while Rhys knocked on the door.</p><p>When there was no reply, Rhys called, \u201cMegan, it\u2019s me. Open up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do I know it\u2019s you?\u201d</p><p>Hearing the teasing tone of her voice, he said, \u201cI could tell you how many times we made love last night.\u201d</p><p>Soft laughter rose in the air as she unlocked the door. \u201cIs nothing sacred?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much.\u201d Rhys stepped into the entryway, followed by Daisy and Delacourt. Erik locked the door behind them.</p><p>Rhys took Megan in his arms. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cDid you find any more...anyone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Adams was the only fatality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do now?\u201d</p><p>Rhys kissed the tip of her nose. \u201cWe aren\u2019t going to do anything. This is between me and Villagrande and no one else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you say that?\u201d Megan exclaimed. \u201cShirl and Villagrande were both here, trying to get in. I\u2019m pretty sure they weren\u2019t just stopping by for a cup of coffee. I mean, Shirl lied to me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got a point,\u201d Erik said.</p><p>\u201cA darn good one, I\u2019d say,\u201d Daisy added.</p><p>With a shake of his head, Rhys pulled Megan into his arms. \u201cAll right, you foolish woman. What do you think we ought to do?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLeave town,\u201d Megan said quickly.</p><p>Rhys looked at Daisy. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree with Megan. There\u2019s a whole world out there. Why shed blood over a few acres?\u201d</p> <p>Erik laughed at her quick reply.</p><p>Rhys snorted softly. \u201cFor the last time, I\u2019m not slinking out of town like some whipped cur.\u201d</p><p>Megan exhaled sharply. \u201cYou and your silly pride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes it\u2019s all a man\u2019s got to call his own,\u201d Rhys said quietly.</p><p>Erik nodded. \u201cBetter to go out with a bang than a whimper, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Rhys said.</p><p>And that, Megan thought glumly, was that.</p><p>Chapter 37</p><p>On Monday night, Rhys thanked Erik and Daisy for their help. Megan had expected them to be anxious to return to Boston, so she was surprised when Daisy said she wanted to stay for another week or so.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been to Beverly Hills yet,\u201d she explained with a sidelong glance at Erik.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be broke by the time I get her out of those shops,\u201d Erik complained, but he was smiling when he said it.</p> <p>Daisy just grinned. \u201cLet\u2019s go find a nice hotel,\u201d she suggested. She gave Megan a hug and Rhys a kiss on the cheek, then with a final wave, she and Erik left the house.</p><p>The next few days passed peacefully enough. Rhys continued to drive Megan back and forth to work. He kept watch from outside while she was at Shore\u2019s, and slept by her side until dawn.</p><p>Megan hadn\u2019t heard anything more from Shirl. In spite of everything, Megan missed her roommate. Good friends were hard to find. She wondered if they could ever be friends again now that Shirl had been turned and she was living with Villagrande. She still had a faint hope that it might be possible once Shirl learned to control her thirst. After all, Megan thought, who was she to judge Shirl\u2019s choice of men when she, herself, had a vampire lover?</p><p>As far as Megan knew, Rhys hadn\u2019t heard from Villagrande. She couldn\u2019t decide if that was good or bad.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he changed his mind,\u201d Megan suggested when Rhys drove her to work on Saturday night.</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s still here. He\u2019s up to something, I just don\u2019t know what.\u201d Rhys drummed his fingertips on the steering wheel. Villagrande had threatened to destroy the members of the Vampire Council one by one and then come for Rhys. But he seemed to have backed off since destroying Adams. Maybe it was only a reprieve while Villagrande dallied with Shirl. Or maybe Megan was right and Villagrande had indeed had a change of heart.</p><p>When they reached Shore\u2019s, Rhys parked the car, then walked Megan across the parking lot to the back entrance.</p><p>\u201cDo you really think it\u2019s necessary for you to stay here every night?\u201d she asked. \u201cI mean, it must be terribly boring, watching me all night long.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d He slipped his hands around her waist and kissed the tip of her nose. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anything else I\u2019d rather do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime doesn\u2019t have the same meaning for me that it does for you,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>She supposed that was true. What were a few wasted hours when he had centuries ahead of him?</p><p>He kissed her again, then opened the back door. \u201cSend a smile my way now and then.\u201d</p><p>It was near the end of her shift when Mr. Parker poked his head out of the office, a sour expression on his face. \u201cPhone for you.\u201d</p><p>Megan nodded. Mr. Parker was a sweetheart about most things, but the one thing he frowned on was personal calls at work, so Megan always kept her cell phone off.</p><p>Mr. Parker left the office, giving Megan her privacy.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMegan, it\u2019s Shirl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShirl, this is a surprise. Is everything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, do you still like being...\u201d Megan paused and peered out the door to make sure no one could overhear her conversation. \u201cA vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful, Meggie. I wish you\u2019d think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? No way!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll keep hoping. Think how much fun we could have. We could room together again.\u201d</p><p>And hunt together. Megan frowned. Had Shirl spoken those words aloud?</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s so much to do,\u201d Shirl was saying. \u201cSo much to see. Everything is new and exciting. Megan, you can\u2019t believe how wonderful it is. I have so much energy, and I\u2019m never tired, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re happy. Are you still with Villagrande?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but he scares me a little. He can be really intense at times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he still planning to take over Rhys\u2019s territory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. He\u2019s out of town right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? Where did he go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told me but I don\u2019t remember,\u201d Shirl said. \u201cHe said he had some kind of vampire business to take care of. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d consider getting together tomorrow night, maybe go see a movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you still don\u2019t trust me.\u201d</p><p>Megan stared into the distance. Neither one of them had family nearby and so, in good times or bad, they had always turned to each other. She remembered the fun times, the silly times, all the laughs they had shared. And the sad times, when they had comforted one another. Once, she would have trusted Shirl with her life. But now...how could she, when her roommate was so changed?</p><p>\u201cMegan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I trust you when you lied to me the other night?\u201d</p><p>Shirl was quiet for a long moment, so long that Megan wondered if she was still on the line.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t help it,\u201d Shirl said. \u201cTom\u00e1s told me to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you do everything he says?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t talk anymore. I have to get back to work. Why don\u2019t you call me tomorrow night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Shirl agreed.</p><p>Megan felt a twinge of guilt when she heard the disappointment in Shirl\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cI miss you, girlfriend,\u201d Shirl said quietly.</p><p>\u201cI miss you, too. Good night.\u201d</p><p>Megan hung up the receiver, then stood there, replaying the conversation in her mind, until Mr. Parker knocked on the door.</p><p>\u201cYou through in here?\u201d he asked. \u201cClark\u2019s out front waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>With a nod, Megan pasted a smile on her face and went out to wait on her least favorite client.</p><p>Later that night, on the way home from work, Megan told Rhys about her conversation with Shirl. \u201cI told her to call me tomorrow night.\u201d She looked at Rhys and shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said Villagrande\u2019s out of town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Is that important?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Did she say how long he\u2019s going to be gone or where he was going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. So, do you think I should see her?\u201d</p><p>Rhys pulled into the driveway and killed the engine. \u201cWhat does your gut tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I miss my friend, but I don\u2019t know if I trust the vampire. What should I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t trust her, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now, I don\u2019t trust anyone.\u201d</p><p>Megan heaved a sigh. \u201cI think I have to see her.\u201d</p><p>Rhys nodded. He wanted to see Shirl, too. He was beginning to think bringing her across had been a mistake. \u201cWhatever you decide, I\u2019ll be there with you. Wait here.\u201d</p><p>As he had every night, Rhys got out of the car, his senses probing the night. Only when he was certain that Villagrande hadn\u2019t been there did he pull into the garage.</p><p>Inside the house, Megan turned on the lights, dropped down on the sofa, and kicked off her shoes.</p><p>Seeing the look on her face, Rhys sat beside her. \u201cGive me your foot.\u201d</p><p>She turned sideways on the sofa and obligingly placed her left foot in his hand. She sighed as he began to massage her ankle. \u201cThat feels wonderful.\u201d She closed her eyes, reveling in the soothing touch of his hands.</p><p>A few minutes later, he lifted her other foot.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in the wrong business,\u201d she murmured. \u201cYou should be a masseur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that right?\u201d His hand moved up, his fingers kneading her calf.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you an hour to stop that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly an hour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m easy,\u201d she said. \u201cTake two.\u201d</p><p>His hand slid farther up her leg, stroking the tender flesh of her inner thigh. \u201cTwo hours should be just about right.\u201d And so saying, he swung her into his arms and carried her swiftly up the stairs to her room.</p><p>The light came on, seemingly of its own accord, as he laid her on the bed. His clothing disappeared as if by magic, and then he stretched out beside her, his hands and lips teasing, touching, tasting, as he undressed her.</p><p>She clung to him, every nerve humming with anticipation, her heart beating in time with his, her hands restless as she caressed him in return.</p><p>\u201cOpen to me, Megan.\u201d His voice washed over her, softly entreating. He was asking for more than her physical surrender. Wanting to please him, she lowered every inhibition, letting their minds merge so that each caress was shared. She knew his thoughts, sensed his pleasure when she rained kisses on his cheeks, his neck, his chest. She experienced his desire, so different from her own, and yet the perfect complement to hers.</p><p>She writhed beneath him, lost in his touch, yearning for more, more. She cried his name as he rose over her, his eyes dark, glowing with need, with a craving she would never understand or share.</p><p>\u201cLet me.\u201d His voice was ragged with longing, with a need she couldn\u2019t begin to imagine.</p><p>And because she loved him, because she wanted to please him, she turned her head to the side, giving him access to her throat. She moaned softly when he bit her, the faint sting swallowed up in the sensual pleasure that exploded through her as his body melded with hers. The sheer wonder of it was almost more than she could bear as she experienced his climax as well as her own. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Drifting, floating somewhere between worlds, she ran her hands over his shoulders and down his arms, marveling at the latent strength that flexed beneath her questing fingertips. His hair, soft and silky, brushed her cheek as he lowered his head to kiss her, a long, slow kiss that had her wanting him again.</p><p>\u201cSo soon?\u201d He nuzzled her neck, his tongue hot against her cooling flesh.</p><p>\u201cOnly if you want to.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSilly question,\u201d he murmured, and then he was moving inside her again, carrying her away to heights only he could climb, evoking sensations only he could arouse.</p><p>He was gone in the morning, but she was used to that by now. At loose ends, nervous at the thought of seeing Shirl later, Megan did something she hadn\u2019t done in months. She went to church.</p><p>Not wanting to talk to anyone, she arrived a few minutes late. Slipping into the back row, she closed her eyes and listened to the choir. They were singing \u201cCome, Thou Fount of Every Blessing,\u201d which was one of her favorite hymns. The words soothed her.</p><p>When the hymn ended, the reverend began to preach. He spoke of the resurrection, when the soul and the body would be reunited, never to be separated again. Did vampires have souls? Or did the soul leave the body when a person was turned? But that didn\u2019t seem right. Wasn\u2019t it the soul that kept the body alive? What happened to vampires when they were destroyed? She knew Rhys had killed to survive. Would he find forgiveness in the next life? And what about hunters? If vampires didn\u2019t have souls, was killing them a sin?</p><p>Megan pressed her hands to her temples. Maybe coming to church hadn\u2019t been such a good idea after all.</p> <p>When the service was over, she went for a walk in the park across the street from the church. Here, with the touch of the sun on her face and a gentle breeze stirring the leaves on the trees, it was hard to believe that vampires were real, or that anyone would choose to become one. And yet, Shirl didn\u2019t seem to have any regrets. Was it that easy to go from human to vampire? To exchange warm sunny days for endless night? To give up strawberry sundaes and bread fresh from the oven for a warm liquid diet? To give up the chance to marry and have children and grandchildren and instead, live long enough to watch everyone you knew and loved pass on?</p><p>Driving home from the park, she thought about Rhys. He had lived alone for centuries. When you had no family, no one to share your life with, what was the point in living at all?</p><p>Overcome by a sudden longing to hear her mother\u2019s voice, Megan called her parents when she reached home. She felt better as soon as she heard her mother\u2019s \u201chello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom, it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMegan! Is something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not. I know I haven\u2019t called in a while. I\u2019m sorry. I just wanted to say hi and see how you are.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re fine,\u201d her mother said, relief evident in her tone. \u201cYour dad\u2019s been very busy with the Boy\u2019s Club. It\u2019s fund-raising time, you know. We\u2019ve hardly been home at all this last month or so.\u201d Megan\u2019s father was Ways and Means Chairman of a local organization that supported a homeless shelter for teenage boys. \u201cSo, how are you doing, Meg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good. Busy at work, as usual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Shirl?\u201d</p><p>Megan hesitated before saying, \u201cShe\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her hello for me. Listen, sweetie, I hate to cut this short, but your dad\u2019s waiting for me out in the car. We were just leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay, Mom. I didn\u2019t want anything special. I just wanted to say hi. Give my love to Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. Come see us when you can. We miss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss you, too. Love you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLove you more, sweetie. Bye.\u201d</p><p>Megan sighed as she closed her phone. She really needed to call home more often. It grounded her in a way nothing else could, reminded her that, no matter what other craziness was going on in her life, there were two people in the world who loved her unconditionally.</p><p>It was near dusk when Megan\u2019s cell phone rang. Caller ID showed it was Shirl. After taking a deep breath, Megan answered.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Shirl asked, getting right to the point. \u201cWhat have you decided?\u201d</p><p>Memories of good times, shared times, flashed through Megan\u2019s mind. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come over later? Say around seven thirty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good! I\u2019ll see you then.\u201d</p><p>Doubts assailed Megan as soon as she ended the call. Was she making a mistake? How could she trust Shirl as long as Villagrande was in the picture? Still, she felt she owed it to Shirl and the friendship they had once shared to give her friend one more chance.</p><p>She managed to shake off her melancholy mood before Rhys arrived that evening. As always, when she knew he was coming, she dressed with care. Tonight, she wore a pair of slinky black pants and a hot pink, off-the-shoulder blouse.</p><p>Rhys whistled softly when he saw her. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to seduce me, babe, you wore the right thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe later,\u201d Megan said. \u201cShirl\u2019s coming over in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can wait,\u201d he said with a wicked grin. \u201cJust don\u2019t make me wait too long.\u201d</p><p>The gleam in his eyes sent a rush of heat to every nerve ending in her body, then the fire pooled low in her belly. She went willingly into his arms, lifting her face for his kiss, a long, slow kiss that left her senses reeling.</p><p>He kissed her again, then jerked his chin toward the stairs. \u201cI\u2019ll be up there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to hide. I mean, Shirl will know you\u2019re here, won\u2019t she? Can\u2019t you sense each other?\u201d</p><p>Rhys shook his head. \u201cI can shield my presence from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore vampire magick?\u201d Megan muttered.</p><p>With a grin, he chucked her under the chin. \u201cShe\u2019s here.\u201d Rhys kissed Megan on the cheek, then went up the stairs, moving so fast he was little more than a blur.</p><p>A moment later, the doorbell rang.</p><p>Megan took a deep breath. When she had talked to Shirl on the phone earlier, inviting her over had seemed like a good idea.</p><p>Now, she wasn\u2019t so sure.</p><p>Chapter 38</p><p>Forcing a smile she was far from feeling, Megan invited Shirl inside.</p><p>As she followed Megan into the living room, Shirl asked, \u201cIs Rhys here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d</p><p>Shirl made a vague gesture with her hand. \u201cHis scent...I can smell it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not surprised.\u201d Megan sat on the sofa and crossed her legs. \u201cHe\u2019s here every night. He\u2019ll probably come by later.\u201d</p><p>Shirl dropped into the chair across from the sofa. Megan fought off a twinge of envy. Shirl looked radiant. She wore a strapless white sundress and three-inch heels. Her pale complexion made her blue eyes and pink lips seem more pronounced; her luxurious silver-blond hair fell over her shoulders in a riot of waves.</p><p>Amazing what vampire blood could do, Megan thought. Too bad you had to become one of the Undead to enjoy the benefits.</p><p>Shirl smoothed a nonexistent wrinkle from her skirt with one pale hand. \u201cHas Rhys said anything about my being with Tom\u00e1s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s customary for fledglings to stay with their makers, so...\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI just wondered how he felt about my leaving.\u201d Shirl leaned forward, her gaze intense. \u201cI really wish you\u2019d join us, Meggie. I would have done this years ago if I could have,\u201d she said exuberantly, and then laughed softly. \u201cOf course, I didn\u2019t know vampires really existed back then. It\u2019s so amazing! It\u2019s a high unlike anything you can imagine. I can have any man I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you don\u2019t want Greg anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMortals and vampires don\u2019t mix. You\u2019ll never understand Rhys, or truly be his, until you\u2019re one of us. Greg was nice, and we had fun together, but now I can have as many men as I like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing new about that,\u201d Megan remarked. Men had always flocked around Shirl. What man over puberty and still breathing could resist a gorgeous cover model?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s different now. It\u2019s part of being a vampire. We all have it. It\u2019s some kind of supernatural glamour that makes us irresistible to mortals. When I see a man I want, all I have to do is call him, and he comes running.\u201d</p><p>Part of being a vampire, Megan thought. They all have it. Was that why she was so attracted to Rhys? Had he worked some kind of vampire mojo on her? Was she really in love with him, or was he manipulating her emotions for his own amusement? And how would she ever truly know?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not thinking of turning Greg, are you?\u201d Megan asked.</p><p>Shirl\u2019s brow narrowed in a frown, and then she shook her head. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think he\u2019d make a good vampire. He\u2019s too...oh, I don\u2019t know, too moral. Too rigid. Maybe you and Rhys and me and Tom\u00e1s could get together some time,\u201d she said, brightening.</p><p>\u201cShirl, you do know that Tom\u00e1s is planning to take over the West Coast, don\u2019t you? I hardly think Rhys is in the mood to socialize with him.\u201d</p><p>Shirl leaned forward, her gaze focused on Megan\u2019s face. \u201cIs Rhys going to give Tom\u00e1s what he wants?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you came here? To find out if Rhys is going to surrender?\u201d</p><p>Shirl\u2019s eyes grew wide. \u201cOf course not, Meggie. How could you even think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s time for you to go. Rhys will be here soon.\u201d</p><p>Shirl rose elegantly, effortlessly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you can\u2019t see things our way, Meggie, truly I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, too,\u201d Megan said. Rising, she pointed at the door. \u201cPlease leave now. Your invitation is rescinded.\u201d</p><p>Megan watched in astonishment as Shirl left the house; it was almost as if a giant hand had pushed her out the door.</p><p>Megan was trying to process what had happened when she sensed Rhys behind her.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t come here because she missed me,\u201d Megan said without turning around. \u201cShe just came to find out what you were going to do.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rhys slid his arms around Megan\u2019s waist and pulled her back against him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said I\u2019d never understand you unless I became a vampire. She said she can have any man she wants, that she can manipulate them.\u201d Megan paused and then, before she could change her mind, she asked the question that was bothering her. \u201cIs that what you\u2019re doing with me? Are you playing with my emotions?\u201d</p><p>Rhys grasped her shoulders and turned her to face him. \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow can I be sure that what I feel is real?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019ll just have to trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s easy for you to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMegan, do you seriously think I\u2019d be happy making love to a woman who was little more than a robot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, when we make love, I feel what you feel....\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2019ve taken your blood, not because I\u2019m deliberately influencing you.\u201d He smiled down at her. \u201cYou like it, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She felt a rush of heat flood her cheeks. \u201cYes, it\u2019s wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you once I\u2019d never do anything you didn\u2019t want me to do. It was a promise I didn\u2019t make lightly. And one I intend to keep.\u201d</p><p>How could she doubt him when he looked at her like that, his gaze open and honest? \u201cI believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we could go upstairs, and I could prove it to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019d like that.\u201d Megan was reaching for his hand when the doorbell rang. Frowning, she glanced over her shoulder. \u201cYou don\u2019t think Shirl\u2019s come back, do you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s Erik and Daisy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are they doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly one way to find out.\u201d</p><p>With Rhys at her heels, Megan went to invite his friends inside.</p><p>\u201cSorry to bother you,\u201d Erik said when they were all seated in the living room, \u201cbut we found the body of a young woman not far from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRecently drained,\u201d Daisy added with a grimace.</p><p>\u201cIt has Villagrande\u2019s stink all over it,\u201d Erik added.</p><p>\u201cI guess that means he\u2019s back in town,\u201d Rhys muttered. \u201cDammit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t mean to spoil your evening,\u201d Daisy said, \u201cbut we thought you ought to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Rhys said. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re leaving for home tonight,\u201d Erik said. \u201cDaisy\u2019s dad called earlier. Her mother is in the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope it\u2019s nothing serious,\u201d Megan said.</p><p>\u201cShe took a tumble down the porch stairs and broke a few ribs and her left leg,\u201d Daisy said. \u201cMy dad assured me that she isn\u2019t seriously hurt, but...\u201d Daisy shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be all right, but I need to be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Megan said.</p><p>\u201cBe careful, you two,\u201d Erik said. He slipped his arm around Daisy\u2019s shoulders. \u201cIf you need us, all you have to do is call.\u201d</p><p>Rhys nodded. A moment later, Erik and Daisy took their leave.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you looking so pensive about?\u201d Rhys asked when they were again seated on the sofa and alone.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking about what Daisy said, about being sure her mother will be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think Daisy would turn her mother into a vampire if her injuries were life-threatening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I doubt it. It\u2019s my understanding that, except for her own daughter, Irene O\u2019Donnell doesn\u2019t have much love for vampires. I guess you can\u2019t blame her, since vampires turned her daughter and killed her youngest son. Last I heard, Daisy\u2019s surviving brother, Alex, was on an extended vacation, one he paid for with my money,\u201d Rhys added.</p><p>\u201cYour money?\u201d Megan exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s a long story, but he had a hand in finding a traitor who had put a two-hundred-thousand-dollar reward on my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo hundred grand! Wow. He must have wanted you dead awfully bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe,\u201d Rhys said.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to her?\u201d Megan asked. Then, seeing the merciless look in his eyes, she said, \u201cNever mind, I don\u2019t want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Rhys said, his voice suddenly low and seductive, \u201cwhere were we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you were about to prove that my feelings for you are my own,\u201d she said, and then murmured, \u201calthough I don\u2019t know how you can do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy. We\u2019ll go upstairs and get undressed. I\u2019ll lie on your bed, with my eyes closed. And anything that happens after that will be all your idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She slid her hand under his shirt and raked her nails over his chest. \u201cSo, if I don\u2019t want you to touch me, you won\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat seems unlikely,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d Her fingers curled in the hair on his chest. \u201cIf I say I just want to go to sleep, then that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do, right?\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cIf that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers trailed downward, sneaking beneath the waistband of his jeans. \u201cAnd if I want you to spend the night and the day in my bed, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMegan...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaving you spend the day with me is the one thing I know is my own idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cI\u2019ll spend the day here if that\u2019s what it takes to convince you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s what I want,\u201d Megan said, even as fresh doubts assailed her. Did she really want to see him when he was at rest? What if he looked gross? What if he turned into some shriveled-up, disgusting, gray-skinned corpse?</p><p>The thought had barely crossed her mind when Rhys burst out laughing. \u201cShriveled-up, disgusting, gray-skinned corpse?\u201d He spoke through gales of laughter. \u201cIs that what you think?\u201d</p><p>She started to yank her hand from inside his jeans, but he was too fast for her. When his hand covered hers, she looked up at him. \u201cI take it you don\u2019t look like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRecently made vampires look dead when they\u2019re at rest. I merely look like I\u2019m asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why haven\u2019t you ever stayed the day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a quirk of mine, a holdover from when I was first made. It\u2019s a matter of trust. New vampires are vulnerable when they\u2019re at rest, so I never spent the day anywhere but in my own lair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re not a new vampire anymore, so I guess you don\u2019t trust me.\u201d</p><p>Releasing her hand, he kissed her cheek, then swung her into his arms and carried her swiftly up the stairs. \u201cDidn\u2019t I already say I\u2019d spend the day here? If that\u2019s not trust, honey, I don\u2019t know what is.\u201d</p><p>When she would have spoken again, he silenced her with a kiss that burned every other thought from her mind. His mouth was still fused with hers as he lowered her to the bed and undressed her, though how he managed to remove her clothing and kiss her at the same time, she could never remember.</p><p>Moments later, he stretched out beside her, as naked as she, the length of his body pressed intimately against her own. His skin was cool against hers but she hardly noticed. She was on fire for him, desperate for his touch, for that moment when their bodies melded together, two halves now whole, two hearts beating as one.</p><p>She closed her eyes as he whispered love words in her ear. The warmth of his voice washed over her, arousing her still further. She raked her nails down his back, her hips lifting to receive him.</p><p>\u201cMegan.\u201d His voice near her ear was filled with silent entreaty.</p><p>A low moan rose in her throat as she turned her head to the side, giving him access to her throat, not caring whether he took a taste or took it all if he would just satisfy the ache that burned through her with every breath.</p><p>She sobbed his name at the touch of his fangs, moaned with indescribable pleasure as he moved deep inside her, carrying her away to that place where nothing existed but the two of them.</p><p>Megan slept until almost noon the next day and woke with a smile on her face as she recalled the night past. She flung one arm out to the side, and nearly jumped out of bed when she realized she wasn\u2019t alone. Her momentary panic disappeared when she saw Rhys lying beside her, his body covered by the sheet from his waist down. How could she have forgotten his promise to spend the day in her bed?</p><p>Propped up on one elbow, she stared at the vampire sleeping only inches away. Would he know if she touched him? She stared at him for several seconds, then ran her forefinger, ever so lightly, over his chest. \u201cSuch a nice chest,\u201d she murmured, and then grinned. \u201cThank goodness he isn\u2019t gray and shriveled-up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou forgot disgusting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Startled, she reared backward. \u201cYou\u2019re awake!\u201d she exclaimed, and then frowned. \u201cHow can you be awake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush, woman. I need my rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re awake!\u201d Sort of, she thought, since his eyes were still closed.</p><p>\u201cOld ones, like myself, can move about during the day, if necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why haven\u2019t I ever seen you when the sun\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a vampire,\u201d he replied, his voice thick with sleep. \u201cI prefer the night. And being in the sun for more than a short time is...unpleasant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill it bother you if I take a shower?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said with a faint smile, \u201cbut if you wait until later, I\u2019ll wash your back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an offer I can\u2019t refuse,\u201d Megan said with a grin. Kissing him lightly on the cheek, she slid out of bed, slipped into a pair of sweats and a T-shirt, and went downstairs.</p><p>Going into the kitchen, she stood there a minute, trying to decide if she was in the mood for breakfast or lunch. In the end, she decided on a fried egg sandwich and a glass of grapefruit juice.</p><p>After breakfast, she tidied up the kitchen, then stood at the sink, staring out the window. The day stretched before her. She didn\u2019t feel like shopping or cleaning house. And with Villagrande prowling around, it probably wasn\u2019t safe to stray too far from home, anyway. She mulled over what Rhys had told her. If he could be active during the day, Villagrande probably could, too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After a moment\u2019s indecision, she fixed a tall glass of iced tea, grabbed her sunglasses, plucked the latest Dean Koontz from the coffee table, and went outside to read. Of course, with her head filled with images of the sexy vampire in her bed, and that same sexy vampire washing her back\u2014and perhaps the rest of her, as well\u2014she couldn\u2019t really concentrate on the story.</p><p>With a sigh, she put the book aside and seriously contemplated her future. Should she stay with Rhys? Or end their relationship before it went any further? Did she want to spend her life with a man who would never grow old? A man who couldn\u2019t give her children? Did she want to live without him? Should she try? What were the chances that she could find a man she would love as much as she loved Rhys?</p><p>She sipped her iced tea as she tried to imagine finding a man who could take Rhys\u2019s place. Of course, it would be impossible. No mortal man could ever compete with a vampire\u2019s supernatural abilities or paranormal charisma. Rhys was like a rare vintage wine, unique and unforgettable. Compared to him, any other man would seem like cheap ale.</p> <p>Of course, she could be taking a lot for granted. Maybe Rhys didn\u2019t want to spend the next thirty or forty years with her. And why would he? Why would any young man want to stay with a wrinkled old woman? Sure, he might stay with her for ten or fifteen years, but after that, he would surely want a younger woman, one who could make love all night long.</p><p>Megan shook her head. Why was she doing this to herself? There could be no happy ending for the two of them. Pairing a vampire and a mortal was like pairing a lion and a lamb. Sooner or later, the lamb was going to get hurt.</p><p>Shaking off her troubling thoughts, she spent the next couple of hours working in the yard, which had been badly neglected lately. She pulled weeds, trimmed the rose bushes, watered the grass.</p><p>Deciding she needed a break, she went into the house and fixed another glass of tea, then returned to the backyard. Standing in the shade, she sipped her drink, her thoughts again drawn to the man sleeping in her bed.</p><p>Her gaze followed her thoughts, and she glanced up at her bedroom window. Impulsively, she set her glass on the patio table and went inside. She hesitated at the bottom of the staircase, took a deep breath, and slowly climbed the stairs. She had seen him earlier, but he hadn\u2019t really been asleep.</p> <p>She paused outside the door, her hand on the knob. Another deep breath, and she opened the door as quietly as she could and peeked inside.</p><p>Rhys lay on his back, one arm folded behind his head, the other resting on his chest. She stared at him for several moments. Was he breathing?</p><p>Curious, she tiptoed into the room and stood beside the bed. The phrase as still as death whispered through the back of her mind.</p><p>She was about to turn away when his hand clamped around her wrist.</p><p>Megan gasped. She hadn\u2019t even seen him move, but he was awake now, staring up at her, his eyes narrowed.</p><p>Muttering \u201csorry,\u201d he released her, then sat up. \u201cIs anything wrong?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. No, I was just...\u201d she shrugged, \u201ccurious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d His gaze probed hers. \u201cWere you repulsed by what you saw?\u201d</p><p>Megan shook her head. \u201cNo, but you weren\u2019t breathing.\u201d She stared at his chest. He was breathing now.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to breathe,\u201d he said. \u201cI do it when I\u2019m awake because it makes me less conspicuous. But when I sleep there\u2019s no need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Just when she thought she knew it all, there was more creepy stuff to learn. It made her wonder once again if they could make things work between them. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I disturbed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d He held out his hand in invitation. \u201cAs you can see, I\u2019m wide awake now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She frowned, and then she saw the evidence of his desire beneath the sheet. \u201cOh! Now? In the daytime?\u201d</p><p>He arched one brow. \u201cWith you, anytime.\u201d</p> <p>Laughing, Megan peeled off her clothes and crawled under the sheet. Doubts be damned, Rhys was here now, and she wanted him. And if he broke her heart later, then, so be it. Maybe it was time to live in the moment, to grab happiness with both hands while she could and stop worrying about the future. After all, she reminded herself, life was uncertain, and no relationship was perfect.</p><p>But he was, she thought, from the top of his head to the soles of his feet. Wrapped in his arms, she kissed and caressed him with an abandon she had never felt before, no doubt because now, for better or worse, she had tied her future to his. He must have sensed the change within her because his kisses grew longer, deeper, as his hands stroked her flesh.</p><p>She whispered, \u201cI love you,\u201d when he rose over her.</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you,\u201d he said, his voice a throaty growl in her ear. \u201cBe mine forever, Megan, my love. Say you\u2019ll marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>He reared back, a look of surprise on his face.</p><p>She grinned at him. \u201cDidn\u2019t expect me to say yes, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, not without taking a few days to think it over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you mean it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, but\u2014are you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery sure,\u201d she murmured, and pulled him closer, linking her arms around his neck as his body merged with hers, his movements strong and slow, arousing her until she writhed beneath him, her mind empty of everything but her need for Rhys.</p><p>She felt his fangs at her throat. Her body arched upward, the pleasure of his bite sweeping her over the edge. She sobbed his name, her nails digging into his back as wave after wave of sensual heat flowed through her.</p><p>Sated, she closed her eyes, felt herself smiling as she curled up against him. He loved her. They were going to be married.</p><p>She was on the brink of sleep when Rhys jackknifed into a sitting position. \u201cDammit! He\u2019s struck again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Megan blinked up at him.</p><p>\u201cThat bastard, Villagrande. He\u2019s killed another of my people.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly wide awake, she sat up, clutching the sheet to her breasts. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>He raked his fingers through his hair, then gained his feet. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just know.\u201d There was no way to explain it, but he knew Hastings had been destroyed, his existence snuffed out at Villagrande\u2019s hand only moments ago. Pacing the floor, he muttered, \u201cThat makes four.\u201d Dammit! Why hadn\u2019t Hastings stayed with the others?</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do now?\u201d</p><p>Rhys paused in front of the window. Drawing the curtains aside, he stared out into the gathering darkness. \u201cI\u2019m going to give him what he wants.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 39</p><p>It was nearing nine o\u2019clock that night when Megan got out of the shower. Glancing at the clock, she decided there was no point in getting dressed. Instead, she pulled on her bathrobe, then went downstairs. Since she was too hungry to cook anything that took more than a few minutes, she settled for scrambled eggs, toast, and orange juice.</p><p>It had been an exhausting day, what with working in the yard and then making love to Rhys, not once but three times. Tugging her bathrobe around her, she smiled at the memory, then yawned behind her hand. He might be inexhaustible, but she wasn\u2019t! Not only that, but she hurt in places that had never hurt before. And in some places she hadn\u2019t even known she had, she thought, amused. But it was a pleasurable kind of pain, a reminder of the most wildly erotic, passionate afternoon of her life.</p><p>A day she would never forget because Rhys had proposed to her and she had said yes. She smiled as she recalled how she had said yes without a second thought, and how surprised he had been when she accepted. She was getting married. All she had to do was name the day and decide whether she wanted a big church wedding with all the trimmings. Or a small, intimate ceremony. Or if they should just elope.</p><p>Her smile faded as she recalled Rhys\u2019s anger and distress when he sensed that another of his vampires had been destroyed by Villagrande. Had Rhys meant it when he said he was going to give Villagrande what he wanted? And what, exactly, did that mean? She was sorely afraid there might be more to it than just leaving the city.</p><p>With a sigh, she rinsed her dishes and put them in the dishwasher, then stood at the sink staring out into the darkness.</p><p>Rhys had gone out, but he would be back soon. She was thinking about slipping into a sexy black nightgown she had bought on a whim and never worn when the doorbell rang. Wondering who it could be, she drew her robe around her and went to the door.</p><p>Looking through the peephole, she saw her former best friend standing alone on the front porch. But it wasn\u2019t surprise that had Megan gasping. It was the blood dripping down Shirl\u2019s face and neck, the complete lack of color in her face.</p><p>Without thinking of the consequences, Megan opened the door and reached for her friend. Shirl staggered forward, then came to an abrupt halt at the threshold.</p><p>Megan tugged on her arm, frowning, and then, after muttering \u201cShirl, come in,\u201d she helped her friend inside and guided her to the sofa. \u201cShirl, what happened to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTom\u00e1s...he got angry with me because I refused to try to trick you into coming to the boat. He beat me and drank from me and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to be all right? What can I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could use a glass of wine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Megan hurried into the kitchen, her thoughts tripping one over the other as she opened a bottle of wine and pulled a glass from the cupboard. Shirl needed to get away from Tom\u00e1s, she thought as she filled the glass. But that wasn\u2019t all. Shirl needed fresh blood to heal her wounds and a place to stay. Maybe Rhys would know what to do.</p><p>Megan was still weighing possibilities when she returned to the living room, only to come to an abrupt halt when she saw Tom\u00e1s Villagrande standing in front of the hearth, a smirk on his face.</p><p>Feeling betrayed, Megan looked at Shirl, who had miraculously recovered. \u201cHow could you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve no time for this,\u201d Villagrande said.</p><p>Before Megan could respond, he was at her side, his arm snaking around her waist. She stared up at him, a hard, cold knot of fear forming in her stomach as his gaze trapped hers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His eyes grew darker, more intense. He whispered one word. \u201cSleep.\u201d</p><p>And the world went black.</p><p>Megan woke slowly. Her first thought was to wonder why the room was rocking back and forth. Were they having an earthquake? She took a deep breath, and her nostrils filled with the scent of the ocean. It took her a moment to realize she was on a boat.</p> <p>A boat? Frowning, she tried to sit up, only then realizing that her hands were tied behind her back. A quick glance showed she was lying on a narrow bunk. In the dim light of a hanging lamp, she could see that the floor was highly polished. A patch of sky sprinkled with stars was visible through the porthole across from the bunk. How long had she been unconscious? How had she gotten here?</p><p>Fear hit her then, hard and quick, in the pit of her stomach. Feeling as though she was going to be sick, she rolled onto her side as the memory of what had happened came rushing back. Shirl had come to the house with some phony story, and Megan had swallowed it hook, line, and sinker. And then Shirl had invited Villagrande inside, and he had hypnotized her or something.</p><p>Where was he now? And what was he going to do with her? Nothing good, she was sure of that. She told herself there was nothing to worry about. Rhys would find her.</p><p>And then she gasped. Of course, that\u2019s why Villagrande had kidnapped her. Because he knew Rhys would come after her.</p><p>But maybe she was worrying for nothing. Rhys had said he was going to give Villagrande what he wanted, so maybe there was nothing to fear. If Rhys wasn\u2019t going to fight Villagrande for control of the city, then the conflict should be over.</p> <p>So why didn\u2019t that make her feel any better?</p><p>Her heart skipped a beat when the cabin door opened. A moment later, Shirl came into view looking as long-legged and gorgeous as always. Tonight, she wore a pair of skintight white pants and an emerald green silk shirt.</p><p>Megan glared at her. It was hard to remember that Shirl had once been her best friend. They had shared a home, laughter and tears, their secret hopes and dreams. Looking at Shirl now, all Megan saw was a stranger. Rhys had told her that becoming a vampire brought out the best or the worst in people. It had definitely brought out the worst in her former best friend.</p><p>Shirl moved closer to the bunk. \u201cWould you believe me if I said I was sorry?\u201d</p><p>Megan struggled into a sitting position. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it, Meggie. I have to do what he says.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe promised not to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you believed him?\u201d Megan asked incredulously.</p><p>\u201cMeggie, you\u2019re my best friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen untie me and let me go. There\u2019s no need for any of this. Rhys isn\u2019t going to fight your lover for the city. He\u2019s going to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Rhys tell you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Where\u2019s Villagrande?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe went hunting.\u201d A dreamy smile played over Shirl\u2019s lips. \u201cHe loves to hunt when the moon is full. I don\u2019t know why.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you go with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went earlier. Sometimes he likes to hunt alone.\u201d Shirl lifted one shoulder and let it fall, as if it was of no concern whether he hunted alone or not, but she couldn\u2019t disguise the petulant tone in her voice.</p><p>Megan shook her head. \u201cI look at you and I hear you, and I can\u2019t believe what I\u2019m hearing. You talk about hunting as if it\u2019s nothing at all. Have you forgotten that you were once human? That all you wanted was to live a normal life? And now you\u2019re no better than he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you feel that way,\u201d Shirl murmured.</p><p>\u201cThen let me go! If there\u2019s any humanity left in you, let me go before it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll only find you again,\u201d Shirl murmured, sounding both resigned and proud at the same time. \u201cNo matter where you go, he\u2019ll find you. You can\u2019t hide from him. You can\u2019t fight him. He\u2019s not only immortal, Meggie. He\u2019s invincible. And some day, I\u2019ll be just like him.\u201d</p><p>Megan closed her eyes as Shirl\u2019s words crushed her only hope of escape. She didn\u2019t know what Villagrande had done to Shirl, but it was obvious he owned her, body and soul. Megan had a terrible suspicion that Shirl would kill her without a qualm if Villagrande said the word. And that was the scariest thought of all.</p><p>Rhys whistled softly as he made his way back to Megan\u2019s house. If he had known what spending the day in Megan\u2019s bed would lead to, he would have done it a hell of a lot sooner, he thought, and then swore softly. He would have to be more considerate of Megan in the future. He had behaved like a rutting bull. She hadn\u2019t complained, but in the future, he needed to remember that she didn\u2019t have the same strength and stamina that he did. Had it been up to him, they would still be in bed, but she had needed rest and nourishment, and so he had told her he needed to feed and left the house.</p><p>He had contacted Nicholas earlier and learned that the three remaining Council members were staying in one of Volger\u2019s lairs in Blue Grass, Iowa, and that several of Volger\u2019s vampires, along with a few trusted humans, were also on the premises to keep an eye out for Villagrande. Rhys had snorted when he heard the name of the town. Blue Grass had a population of just over a thousand; twenty-five percent of the residents were under the age of eighteen. And then he had grinned inwardly. Julius had always had a taste for young blood.</p><p>As for Hastings, no one knew where\u2019d he gone. According to Nicholas, Hastings had been there one night and the next he was gone. The general consensus was that he\u2019d headed back to Medford and Villagrande had found him there.</p><p>\u201cStupid,\u201d Rhys had muttered. If Hastings had just stayed put, he\u2019d still be alive.</p><p>Nicholas had added that they were all getting antsy and wanted to know when they could return to their own lairs.</p><p>Rhys had assured Nicholas it would be soon, and hoped that was the truth. As for himself, he hated to leave LA, but what the hell, the world was a big place. He hadn\u2019t been to Italy in a while. He wondered if Megan had ever been to Naples or Sicily, and then frowned. He was taking a lot for granted. True, she had said she would marry him, but that didn\u2019t mean she wanted to quit her job or leave the country. For that matter, they hadn\u2019t set a date for the wedding, either. He didn\u2019t know if she wanted a big wedding or if she would be content with something more intimate, say just the two of them. One thing he did know\u2014she was going to make a beautiful bride.</p><p>A glance at the sky showed it was almost eleven. Smiling, he quickened his step, eager to see her again.</p><p>He knew, before he opened the front door, that she was gone. A single, indrawn breath told him what had transpired. Oh, not the details, but Shirl\u2019s scent was strong in the air, as was Villagrande\u2019s. Rhys didn\u2019t know how the other two vampires had managed to penetrate the protective wards and spells that had been placed on Megan\u2019s house, but that didn\u2019t matter. All that was important now was that Villagrande had Megan.</p><p>Rhys swore a vile oath as he stepped back and slammed the door. Dammit! So much for Erik\u2019s protective magick! Why the hell hadn\u2019t it worked? And where was Megan?</p><p>He followed her scent until it disappeared and then, closing his eyes, he took several slow deep breaths and opened his senses, homing in on the blood bond that connected them.</p><p>It drew him unerringly down the coast toward San Diego.</p><p>Speeding through the night faster than the human eye could follow, he prayed he wasn\u2019t too late.</p><p>Chapter 40</p><p>Megan didn\u2019t hear him coming, but she knew when Villagrande boarded the ship. It was as if a dark shroud settled over the craft. Evil slid along her skin and crawled inside her like some loathsome insect. She knew, somehow, that when she had seen him before, he had been masking his true self, and that what she sensed now was the real Tom\u00e1s Villagrande. Had he been masking his true nature from Shirl? Or was she so infatuated with his supernatural power and his promises that she had turned a blind eye to the truth of what he was?</p><p>He appeared beside the bunk between one heartbeat and the next. Eyes red, fangs bared, he was a nightmare come to life.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d Moving closer to the bunk, he swept his gaze over her. It made her feel dirty, defiled. \u201cIt\u2019s time for dinner.\u201d</p><p>Megan stared up at him. Heart pounding, body trembling uncontrollably, she couldn\u2019t think, couldn\u2019t speak. Like a fox helplessly caught in the jaws of a trap, she could only stare up at him while a voice in the back of her mind whispered that this was what death looked like.</p><p>Thoughts flew through her mind like leaves in a wind storm. She would never see her parents again. Never see Rhys. Never be a bride. Darkness swirled at the edge of her consciousness, and she prayed she would pass out before Villagrande sank his fangs into her throat. What if he didn\u2019t intend to kill her? What if he turned her into a vampire? For a fleeting moment, she thought she would rather be a vampire than die so horribly, but then Villagrande grinned at her and she knew she\u2019d rather be dead than become what he was.</p><p>His fangs lengthened. Gleaming. Bright white. She took a deep breath as fear coiled deep in the pit of her stomach. She tried to look away from his hellish gaze, but like a rabbit mesmerized by a snake, she could only lie there, waiting for death to strike.</p><p>Megan tensed when Villagrande lowered his head to her neck, but then a curious thing happened. As soon as his fangs touched her skin, a shower of bright golden yellow sparks exploded between them. Villagrande reared back, a vile curse issuing from his lips.</p><p>Startled, Megan cried out, her whole body tensing in fearful anticipation as the fiery embers rained down on her face and neck, but there was no pain. The bright yellow sparks vanished when they touched her skin.</p><p>Villagrande wasn\u2019t so fortunate. The embers burned his skin wherever they touched, leaving raw, red patches.</p><p>He reeled backward as Shirl burst into the cabin. \u201cTom\u00e1s, what\u2019s going on...?\u201d</p><p>She had scarcely uttered the words when Rhys appeared behind her in the doorway. His eyes took on a warm red glow when he saw Villagrande, and, before Megan could move or speak, Villagrande and Rhys were on each other. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With her hands still bound behind her back, Megan struggled to sit up as the two vampires battled each other. The smell of blood and scorched flesh mingled with the scent of sea and salt, making her stomach churn.</p><p>Villagrande hurled Rhys against the wall with such force, Megan was surprised the wood didn\u2019t crack from the impact. With a feral cry, Rhys sprang to his feet and lunged at Villagrande, his hands like claws, his fangs dripping blood.</p><p>It was a battle unlike anything she had ever seen. Like two superheroes, they flung each other to and fro, fangs and claws rending preternatural flesh that healed almost instantly. Blood splattered on the walls, the ceiling, the deck.</p> <p>As blood sprayed over her face and robe, Megan cowered against the bed, praying that Rhys would be the victor even as she wondered how much more punishment he could take.</p><p>She let out a cry as Shirl struck Rhys from behind, opening a gash in the back of his head and knocking him off balance. Springing forward, Villagrande seized Rhys by the nape and slammed him to the floor, facedown; then, straddling his back, Villagrande grasped a handful of Rhys\u2019s hair, jerked his head backward and buried his fangs in the side of Rhys\u2019s neck.</p><p>Megan glanced at Shirl, but one look at Shirl\u2019s face, contorted with bloodlust, banished all thought of asking for help. Her former friend\u2019s eyes burned with excitement as the scent of Rhys\u2019s blood filled the air.</p><p>Megan swallowed the bile rising in her throat. Rhys had told her that vampires rarely fed on other vampires, but Villagrande drank for what seemed like forever, then rose gracefully to his feet.</p><p>Moving toward a small desk, Villagrande picked up a long wooden letter opener and tossed it to Shirl. \u201cFinish him and throw him overboard.\u201d</p> <p>Shifting his focus to Megan, Villagrande lifted a hand to his face, his fingers gingerly probing his scorched flesh. He glared at her for a long moment; then, muttering, \u201cThis isn\u2019t over,\u201d he stalked out of the cabin.</p><p>Shirl stared after Tom\u00e1s and then, to Megan\u2019s astonishment, Shirl laid the stake aside and sank her fangs into Rhys\u2019s throat.</p><p>Megan stared at Rhys. She had to do something, but what? Clinging to the faint hope that the blood bond she shared with Rhys would somehow give her the strength she needed, she struggled against the rope that bound her wrists.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know whether it was the adrenaline coursing through her body, the power of her connection to Rhys, or if the ropes hadn\u2019t been as tight as she\u2019d thought, but one last desperate tug, and her hands slipped free.</p><p>Moving as silently as she could, she tiptoed toward Shirl. Sending a quick prayer winging toward heaven, Megan grabbed the letter opener and plunged it into Shirl\u2019s back, aiming for her treacherous heart.</p><p>The wood slid through skin and flesh and muscle as easily as a needle through cloth.</p> <p>Shirl toppled onto the cabin floor without a sound.</p><p>Megan didn\u2019t waste time wondering if Shirl was dead. Surprisingly, she didn\u2019t care one way or the other.</p><p>Kneeling beside Rhys, she shook his shoulder, gently at first, and then more vigorously. \u201cRhys! Dammit, Rhys, I need you to get us out of here. Now!\u201d When he didn\u2019t speak, didn\u2019t even twitch, she shook him again, harder. \u201cRhys! Don\u2019t you dare be dead!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m already dead,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Relief washed through her when he rolled onto his back, but only for a moment. He was badly hurt. His face was swollen and discolored; blood seeped from the gash in the back of his head, staining the floor beneath him.</p><p>\u201cRhys, we need to go, now.\u201d Knowing that Villagrande could return at any moment, she glanced warily at the door.</p><p>\u201cI need...blood.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him, then sighed in resignation. She was the only game in town. Rolling up her sleeve, she offered him her wrist.</p> <p>His gaze met hers for stretched seconds, and in his eyes she saw regret for what he was asking of her, and gratitude for her willingness to give it to him.</p><p>She turned her head away as he drew her arm to his mouth. He drank greedily, the pull of his mouth on her skin both repellant and oddly sensual. He had tasted her before, but this was different. This wasn\u2019t an act of love but survival.</p><p>A growl rose in his throat and then, abruptly, he pushed her away.</p><p>Megan watched the red fade from his eyes, the bruises vanish from his face. Moments later, he was standing over her, as silent and still as a statue. The hair raised on her arms as he drew on his preternatural power.</p><p>\u201cHang on,\u201d he said, and lifted her into his arms.</p><p>Weak from the loss of blood, she rested her head on his shoulder and closed her eyes, her stomach roiling as the world spun out of focus. There was a dizzying sensation of movement, as if she were on an out-of-control roller coaster, a rush of wind in her ears, an overwhelming sense of disorientation, and then nothing.</p><p>When her stomach and the world stopped spinning, she opened her eyes. And frowned. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoston!\u201d She sagged against him. \u201cWhat are we doing here?\u201d</p><p>Rhys jerked his chin toward the house behind them. \u201cThis is Erik\u2019s place.\u201d</p><p>The house was small and square, with a red brick chimney, bright yellow shutters, a white picket fence, a security screen door, and white bars over the windows, upstairs and down.</p><p>The front door opened before Rhys knocked, and Erik peered out at them, a comical look of surprise on his face. \u201cWhat the hell! What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooking for a place to spend the day,\u201d Rhys muttered. \u201cCan you put us up?\u201d</p><p>Rhys could almost see the wheels turning in the other vampire\u2019s head as Erik glanced from Rhys to Megan and back again. Megan looked weak and pale, and he knew Delacourt was wondering if Rhys had started to bring Megan across and then changed his mind.</p><p>\u201cSure, come on in.\u201d Erik stepped aside, then closed and locked the door before following Rhys and Megan into the living room. \u201cSit down and tell us what happened. Daisy, why don\u2019t you get Megan a glass of wine?\u201d</p><p>With a nod, Daisy disappeared into the kitchen.</p><p>Rhys eased Megan down on the sofa, then slipped his arm around her shoulders. Her head fell back, and her eyelids fluttered down. It worried him that she looked so pale. Had he taken too much?</p><p>Erik lifted one brow. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVillagrande kidnapped Megan. I almost got there too late. I owe you a big one. If it wasn\u2019t for that spell you worked on Megan, I think he would have killed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe looks half-dead now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI needed blood. Villagrande beat the crap out of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>Rhys ran his knuckles lightly over Megan\u2019s cheek. \u201cI was going to let the bastard have the city,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cbut I never got a chance to tell him so.\u201d</p><p>Daisy glanced at the glass in her hand, then looked at Rhys. \u201cShould we wake her up?\u201d</p><p>Rhys shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you should let her rest,\u201d Erik remarked. \u201cShe looks exhausted.\u201d</p><p>Megan stirred in Rhys\u2019s embrace. \u201cI\u2019m thirsty.\u201d</p><p>Rhys took the glass from Daisy and held it to Megan\u2019s lips. \u201cHere you go, love.\u201d</p><p>Megan looked up at him, a half smile on her face as she murmured, \u201cWine is supposed to be good for the blood.\u201d</p><p>Rhys shook his head, amazed that she could find humor in the situation, then muttered, \u201cJust drink it.\u201d</p><p>Megan drained the glass, then curled up against his side and closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019ll be all right once she\u2019s had some sleep.\u201d Daisy took the glass from Rhys and set it on a side table.</p><p>Rhys nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make up the bed in the guest room,\u201d Daisy said. \u201cShe\u2019ll be comfortable there. You\u2019re welcome to share our lair in the basement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m staying with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think that\u2019s wise, all things considered?\u201d Erik asked.</p><p>\u201cProbably not, but I\u2019m not leaving her alone again. If Villagrande finds us, he\u2019ll have to go through me to get to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like he already did that once,\u201d Erik remarked with a wry grin. \u201cAre you planning to give him a second chance?\u201d</p><p>Rhys glared at Delacourt.</p><p>Daisy placed her hand on her husband\u2019s arm. \u201cI\u2019m not sure you\u2019re helping.\u201d She looked at Rhys. \u201cYou don\u2019t think Villagrande will come here, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if he does, it\u2019ll be three against one. Four, when Alex gets home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he still spending my money?\u201d Rhys had paid Alex O\u2019Donnell two hundred thousand dollars for his help in locating Mariah. He had learned later that Alex had split the money with Daisy.</p><p>\u201cJust as fast as he can,\u201d Daisy said with a grin. \u201cOr he was. He\u2019ll he home from his honeymoon tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe got married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast month. They\u2019ve been touring Spain but they\u2019ll be home soon. I\u2019ll have Megan\u2019s bed made up in two shakes.\u201d</p><p>A short time later, Rhys carried Megan up the stairs. He waved Daisy away when she offered to help get Megan into bed. \u201cThanks, but I can do it.\u201d</p><p>Megan muttered something incoherent as Rhys eased her out of her bathrobe, noticing for the first time that it was stained with blood. Not all of it was his. He could smell Villagrande on her. \u201cWhat\u2019d you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need a shower. I feel dirty.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. If she hadn\u2019t suggested it, he would have. The sooner they washed Villagrande\u2019s stink off of her, the better. \u201cWait here, I\u2019ll turn the water on.\u201d</p><p>Grunting softly, he went into the bathroom and turned on the taps. Standing there, waiting for the water to get hot, he tried to understand how she must feel, but couldn\u2019t. He had killed when necessary and never lost any sleep over it. He knew he had a reputation for being a hard-ass, and sometimes he was, although since Megan had entered his life, he seemed to have lost a little of his edge.</p><p>\u201cNothing like the love of a good woman,\u201d he muttered as he tested the water. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When it was warm enough, he walked Megan to the shower, closed the door after her, then turned his back, giving her some privacy. He probably should have left the room, but he wasn\u2019t leaving her alone as long as Villagrande was a threat.</p><p>It took him a minute to realize she was standing under the spray, crying. Well, who could blame her? She\u2019d been through hell tonight.</p><p>Undressing, he opened the shower door, stepped inside, and gathered her into his arms. He held her until the water started to cool, then took the soap and scrubbed her from head to foot. When he was done, he turned off the water, then wrapped her in a towel and carried her into the bedroom.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cNothing for you to be sorry for.\u201d He cursed his body\u2019s instant reaction to hers as he dried her off. It was all he could do to keep from seducing her. Like the lust for blood, battle often aroused his baser instincts. Reining in his desire, he slipped the nightgown Daisy had provided over Megan\u2019s head, then tucked her into bed.</p><p>\u201cYou could have been killed,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cGet some sleep, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou need the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t leave me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He wiped a lock of damp hair from her brow. \u201cYou\u2019ll feel better in the morning.\u201d</p><p>She looked doubtful, but obediently closed her eyes.</p><p>In minutes, the slow, steady beat of her heart told him she was asleep.</p><p>He switched off the bedside light, then sat beside her, staring into the darkness. Dawn was only a few hours away.</p> <p>He was leaning against the headboard, his eyes closed, when Megan bolted upright. \u201cRhys! Rhys!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, her eyes wild, then slumped back on the pillow. \u201cI was having a nightmare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShirl\u2019s really dead, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Rhys nodded. Guilt was an emotion he rarely suffered, but it flayed him now. Because of him, Megan had killed her best friend. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He blew out a breath. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will be. I couldn\u2019t let her destroy you, and...\u201d Her fingers worried the edge of the blanket. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t really Shirl that I...\u201d She couldn\u2019t bring herself to say the word killed out loud. \u201cVillagrande twisted her thinking somehow. Or maybe it was just what you said before, that being a vampire brings out the best or the worst in people. I guess in her case it brought out the worst. And being with Villagrande didn\u2019t help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should hate me.\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes widened. \u201cWhy? It wasn\u2019t your fault. It was mine. I\u2019m the one who asked you to turn her. Or maybe it was Shirl\u2019s fault. She begged me to ask you. None of us knew it would end like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI put too much faith in Erik\u2019s magick,\u201d Rhys muttered. \u201cI never should have left you alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault. Erik\u2019s magick worked just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how...?\u201d Rhys looked at her, his eyes narrowed. \u201cTell me you didn\u2019t invite Villagrande inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d Megan said, scowling at him. \u201cShirl tricked me. She came to the house, all bloody and pale, and told me Villagrande had beat her up\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she invited him in,\u201d Rhys finished for her. He brushed a lock of hair from her brow. \u201cIt\u2019s over now.\u201d Sitting on the edge of the bed, he drew the covers over Megan, then kissed her cheek. She was too good for him by half, her heart too pure, too forgiving.</p><p>\u201cStay with me and keep the nightmares away?\u201d she asked sleepily.</p><p>Nodding, he took her hand in his, his heart aching with tenderness. Foolish girl, didn\u2019t she know he was the biggest nightmare in her life?</p><p>He sat beside her, watching as sleep claimed her again. He had come close to losing her tonight. Too damn close.</p><p>In spite of the fact that she was human and he wasn\u2019t, he had hoped they could have a life together. He should have known better. Relationships between vampires and mortals never ended well. Every minute he spent with Megan put her life in danger. Even if he managed to destroy Villagrande, which seemed doubtful, he had other enemies who wouldn\u2019t hesitate to use her to get to him.</p><p>If he had never turned Shirl, Megan\u2019s life might not be in danger now. But Megan had found the courage to destroy Shirl and save his life, and Villagrande wasn\u2019t one to forgive and forget.</p><p>Adrianna was proof of that.</p><p>He dragged a hand through his hair. He didn\u2019t know how he would be able to leave her when this was over, didn\u2019t know if he wanted to go on existing without her. But he couldn\u2019t go on putting her future at risk. She deserved to live a long and happy life surrounded by people who loved her. Getting out of her life was the best thing he could do for her.</p><p>But first, he had to destroy Villagrande. It was the only way to protect Megan.</p><p>And when it was done, he would tell her good-bye.</p><p>Chapter 41</p><p>Megan woke slowly, certain that something was wrong. And then, between one breath and the next, memory came flooding back. She had killed her best friend last night. She remembered it all now, the horrible encounter with Villagrande on the boat, then traveling, vampire-style, to the Delacourt house in Boston.</p><p>But all of that was swallowed up in a wave of guilt and grief. Shirl was dead. The words repeated in her mind over and over again. Shirl was dead. It hadn\u2019t been a nightmare. She had plunged a wooden stake into her friend\u2019s back and pierced her heart.</p><p>Megan bit down on her lower lip as hot tears stung her eyes and cascaded down her cheeks. Conscious of Rhys sleeping beside her, she tried to muffle her sobs, but it was no use. Memories of the fun she and Shirl had once had swam to the surface of her mind. She remembered all the good times they\u2019d had visiting their favorite day spa, going to the movies and shopping, the shared confidences, the foolish hopes and dreams they had confessed to each other late at night in front of the fire, Shirl\u2019s excitement when she was accepted by the top modeling agency in the city.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she murmured. \u201cOh, Shirl, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d She glanced at Rhys. If she had never met him, Shirl might still be alive. Yet, even as the thought crossed Megan\u2019s mind, she knew it wasn\u2019t true. As cliche as it sounded, Shirl had had a date with death. Becoming a vampire had just postponed it a few weeks. Maybe you couldn\u2019t cheat death. Maybe, when it was your time to go, the Grim Reaper would find you one way or another....</p><p>Megan shook the morbid thoughts from her mind, then used a corner of the sheet to wipe away her tears. What was done was done, and there was no going back. Shirl had changed once she became a vampire, and not for the better. Megan had been forced to make a choice last night. She hadn\u2019t had time to think it over or to weigh the consequences. Her best friend had been about to kill Rhys, and Megan\u2019s heart had made the decision.</p><p>Trying to ignore the guilt that still gnawed at her, Megan slid out of bed, turned on the bedside lamp, and glanced at her surroundings. The curtains, a pale sage green, matched the walls. The ceiling was white, the floor was polished hardwood. The furniture looked like antique mahogany. The bathrobe and gown she had worn the night before were nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Feeling the need to relieve herself, she went into the bathroom and closed the door. Clean towels had been laid out, as well as two bathrobes, a pink one for her, a black one for Rhys. A pair of toothbrushes, still in the packages, and a new tube of toothpaste sat on top of the towels. Megan couldn\u2019t help grinning. It had never occurred to her that vampires brushed their fangs.</p><p>After brushing her teeth, she wrapped up in the fluffy pink bathrobe and tiptoed down the hall toward the stairs.</p><p>She passed two doors, both closed. Were Erik and Daisy sleeping in twin coffins behind one of them?</p><p>Belting the robe tighter, Megan made her way down the stairs. She wandered through the house\u2014living room, family room, dining room, bathroom, laundry room. Daisy\u2019s taste ran to bright colors. There was nothing out of the ordinary, nothing to indicate that a pair of vampires lived in the house and yet, even though Megan was sure it was only her imagination, the rooms seemed eerily silent.</p><p>\u201cLike a tomb,\u201d she muttered. Which she supposed it was, since there were three of the Undead resting here.</p><p>She paused in the kitchen doorway, wondering what the odds were of finding anything to eat in the refrigerator. Moving across the floor, she reached for the handle, then hesitated, hoping it wasn\u2019t filled with bottles of blood. After taking a breath, she opened the door, and breathed a sigh of relief. Inside, she found bacon, a dozen eggs, a carton of butter, a package of Swiss cheese, another of ham, and a quart of milk. She found small jars of mayonnaise, ketchup, and mustard on the counter, along with a loaf of bread, a small frying pan, and a spatula.</p><p>Daisy was indeed a good hostess. She had obviously gone to the store late last night so Megan would have the fixings for breakfast this morning and lunch later in the day.</p><p>Concentrating on the task at hand, Megan fried bacon and scrambled eggs for breakfast. She ate in the living room. In an effort to keep her grief at bay, she focused her thoughts on Daisy Delacourt, wondering how long she had been a vampire and whether she missed being mortal. If it wasn\u2019t for the blood thing and not being able to be outside during the day, being one of the Undead might not be so bad. Not so bad? What was she thinking? Vampires killed people. Being Undead made formerly normal, fun-loving young women like Shirl into monsters....</p><p>Megan set her plate on the coffee table as fresh tears scalded her eyes. She cried for what she had done, for what Shirl had become, and for Shirl\u2019s parents, who would never know what had happened to their daughter. She cried because she loved Rhys with all her heart, because she wanted to be with him for the rest of her life, and because she was sorely afraid she was going to lose him.</p><p>Gradually, her tears subsided. Depressed and lethargic, she curled up on the sofa and fell asleep.</p><p>When she woke, the sun was going down. Feeling stiff, she sat up and stretched her arms over her head. She heard the faint sound of hushed voices from the next room. Her ears perked up when someone\u2014Daisy?\u2014mentioned her name. Megan frowned. Why were they talking about her? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rising, she tiptoed toward the door. She didn\u2019t approve of eavesdropping, as a rule, but desperate times called for desperate measures.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think she\u2019ll be safe without you?\u201d Daisy\u2019s voice, her tone slightly impatient.</p><p>\u201cHe could have killed her,\u201d Rhys said. \u201cHe damn near got me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cListen,\u201d Erik spoke up. \u201cBetween us, we can look after her. We\u2019ll get Alex to come and stay here during the day. Daisy\u2019s dad, too, if necessary. With all five of us guarding her, she should be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what if she isn\u2019t? How am I supposed to live with myself if she gets killed because of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that serious, huh?\u201d Erik asked, a note of wry amusement in his voice.</p><p>\u201cI asked her to marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Daisy exclaimed. \u201cDid she say yes?\u201d</p> <p>Megan had had enough. Before Rhys could reply, she stepped into the room. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask the prospective bride?\u201d</p><p>They all turned to look at her.</p><p>\u201cEavesdropping, were you?\u201d Rhys asked.</p><p>\u201cHow else am I going to find out what\u2019s going on around here?\u201d She marched toward him. \u201cJust going to walk out on me, were you?\u201d She stabbed a finger at his chest. \u201cDon\u2019t I have anything to say about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMegan...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re worried about me. I\u2019m worried, too. And scared to death. But I don\u2019t think your leaving will make me any safer. Villagrande has a score to settle with me, too, remember? His last words were \u2018this isn\u2019t over.\u2019 Sure sounds like a threat to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI agree with Megan,\u201d Erik said.</p><p>Rhys swore softly. \u201cI was going to give him the city,\u201d he muttered. \u201cNone of this was necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t matter now,\u201d Daisy said. \u201cSounds like Villagrande\u2019s after both of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, it\u2019s settled then.\u201d Erik took Daisy by the hand. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse us, we need to go out for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t be long,\u201d Daisy called over her shoulder.</p><p>After Delacourt and Daisy left the house, Rhys pulled Megan into his arms. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I got you involved in all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRhys, stop blaming yourself. I\u2019m with you because I want to be. Every relationship has its problems.\u201d</p><p>He snorted softly. \u201cIs that what you call Villagrande? A problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, a mighty big one, and...oh! I need to call Mr. Parker and tell him I won\u2019t be in tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr any night, as long as you\u2019re in danger,\u201d Rhys said, reaching into his pocket. \u201cHere, use my phone.\u201d</p><p>Megan stared at the BlackBerry in her hand, noting, absently, that it was top of the line. But that was immaterial at the moment. Once again, her life had been turned upside down because of Rhys Costain. This time, it could cost her her job. Being a glorified saleswoman wasn\u2019t the greatest job in the world, but she enjoyed working at Shore\u2019s, and she got along well with Mr. Parker. Still, business was business. How much time could she take off before he decided to let her go?</p><p>\u201cMegan?\u201d</p><p>She looked up at Rhys, nodded, and punched in Mr. Parker\u2019s private number.</p><p>Chapter 42</p><p>Shoulders hunched, Tom\u00e1s Villagrande sat atop the Hollywood sign, letting the cool air soothe the burns scattered over his face, hands, chest, and shoulders. His clothing had been no protection against the hellish embers that had burned through cloth and skin alike. He hadn\u2019t hurt so badly in centuries, and it was all that red-haired tart\u2019s fault. Once his initial pain and anger had subsided, Tom\u00e1s realized his power had been kept at bay by some supernatural spell. The woman wasn\u2019t a witch, which begged the question: Who had worked the enchantment? And the only logical answer was Erik Delacourt.</p><p>Tom\u00e1s swore softly. Not long ago, he had done Delacourt a favor by sparing his life. And then, in an uncommon burst of charity, he had spared the lives of Daisy\u2019s father and brother, as well.</p><p>\u201cJust goes to show you,\u201d Tom\u00e1s muttered. \u201cSooner or later, every good deed comes back to bite you in the ass.\u201d</p><p>He lifted a hand to his face, grimacing as his fingers encountered puckered flesh. What foul curse had Delacourt conjured, Tom\u00e1s wondered, that prevented his injuries from healing overnight?</p><p>Yes, Delacourt had much to answer for.</p><p>And then there was the matter of Shirl\u2019s destruction. It surprised him to realize that he missed her. He had been drawn to her from the first moment he saw her, captivated by her ethereal beauty. She had enjoyed being a vampire, reveled in her preternatural power. He had been charmed by her exuberance when she was on the hunt, puzzled by her reluctance to take a life.</p><p>And now the lovely Shirl was gone, her existence snuffed out before he had fully savored her. Before he had tired of her. The tart would pay for that, too, he mused, though he wasn\u2019t sure what form his vengeance would take. A life for a life? Perhaps.</p><p>Or perhaps he would destroy Costain and make the whore his slave, subject to his every whim. He would humble her, degrade her, until she had no will of her own, and then, when she no longer amused him, he would drain her dry and toss her aside, an empty husk.</p><p>But first, he had to find her.</p><p>Chapter 43</p><p>Mr. Parker assured Megan that her job would be waiting for her when she returned to LA. She had told him a crisis had arisen in her family and that she hadn\u2019t had time to call him before she left town. She had been grateful when he didn\u2019t ask for details.</p><p>She\u2019d no sooner ended the call than a booming male voice yelled, \u201cHey, Daisy Mae, we\u2019re back!\u201d and a tall, athletic young man with dark brown hair and brown eyes strolled into the living room, his arms filled with gaily wrapped packages. \u201cWait until you see what I brought you from Spain....\u201d</p><p>His voice trailed off, and he came to an abrupt halt when he saw Megan and Rhys. Exclaiming, \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d he glanced around the room; then, eyes narrowed, he glared at Rhys. \u201cWhere\u2019s my sister, vampire?\u201d</p><p>Rhys grinned at the other man. \u201cHow\u2019s it hanging, hunter?\u201d</p><p>Megan studied the man. It could only be Daisy\u2019s brother, Alex.</p><p>He dropped the packages on the sofa. \u201cEx-hunter. I\u2019m a married man now. Just got home from my honeymoon, as a matter of fact.\u201d He glanced at Megan, then looked back at Rhys. \u201cSo, are you going to introduce me to this pretty woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMegan, this is Daisy\u2019s brother. Alex, this is Megan DeLacey.\u201d</p><p>Stepping forward, Alex shook Megan\u2019s hand. \u201cPleased to meet you. Why don\u2019t we sit down? So,\u201d Alex said when they were all seated, \u201cwhat brings the two of you to Boston?\u201d</p><p>As succinctly as possible, Rhys told Alex about Villagrande.</p><p>\u201cDamn!\u201d Alex leaned back in his chair. \u201cDid you have to antagonize the baddest badass vamp of them all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my idea.\u201d Rhys lifted his head, his nostrils flaring. \u201cYour sister\u2019s home.\u201d</p><p>Rhys had no sooner spoken the words than Daisy and Erik materialized in the living room.</p><p>\u201cAlex!\u201d Daisy cried, and threw herself into her brother\u2019s arms. \u201cWelcome home. Where\u2019s Paula?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dropped her off at her parents\u2019 house. She couldn\u2019t wait to tell them the good news. She\u2019s pregnant!\u201d</p><p>Megan had expected Daisy to look happy; instead, a sudden sadness flitted through her eyes.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful,\u201d Daisy murmured. \u201cIt\u2019ll be nice to have a baby in the family.\u201d</p><p>Megan frowned, puzzled by Daisy\u2019s reaction. And then she understood. Daisy was a vampire. She would never have a child of her own.</p><p>When the awkward moment passed, Rhys, Erik, Daisy, and Alex tossed around ideas on how best to protect Megan and destroy Villagrande.</p><p>\u201cDoes he know you\u2019re here?\u201d Alex asked.</p><p>Rhys shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. But he\u2019s tasted my blood. He shouldn\u2019t have any troubling finding us.\u201d</p><p>Alex grunted softly. \u201cI\u2019d like to have seen that spell you mentioned in action.\u201d He looked at Erik. \u201cWhere\u2019d you find it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn an ancient grimoire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know it would work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t. I layered it into another spell, just in case. I think it was the combination of the two that caused the damage Megan told us about.\u201d</p><p>Alex chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m all in favor of anything that\u2019ll repel vampires. Present company excepted, of course,\u201d he added with a wry grin.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Rhys muttered.</p><p>\u201cSo, Erik,\u201d Alex said, \u201cmaybe if you ramped up that hellfire spell, it would destroy Villagrande.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Erik replied. \u201cAnd maybe it would destroy Rhys, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to avoid that, if possible,\u201d Rhys said.</p><p>Alex yawned behind his hand. \u201cThis isn\u2019t getting us anywhere. I\u2019m gonna go get my wife, take her home, and make love to her all night long. My wife,\u201d he repeated with a grin. \u201cI like the sound of that.\u201d Rising, he kissed Daisy on the cheek, cuffed Erik on the shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you guys tomorrow night. If I come up with anything before that, I\u2019ll give Megan a call.\u201d</p><p>Rhys sat on the foot of the bed, watching Megan sleep. She seemed to grow more beautiful with every passing day, or maybe it was just that he loved her more every time he saw her. And she loved him. That was the most remarkable part. In spite of the fact that he had not only complicated her life but put her in danger, she still wanted to be with him.</p><p>\u201cRhys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was. Come to bed. It\u2019s lonesome without you.\u201d She turned the light on when he started to undress.</p><p>He paused in the act of removing his shirt, one brow arched as he looked at her. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWatching you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve seen me undress before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, sue me. I like to watch.\u201d</p> <p>With a shake of his head, he shrugged out of his shirt and tossed it on a chair and then, ever so slowly, he unbuckled his belt and let it fall to the floor. With his gaze locked on hers, he toed off his boots and kicked them aside.</p><p>Megan sat up, grinning, as he pulled off his socks and threw them at her, one by one.</p><p>\u201cAre you watching?\u201d he asked, his voice dripping with sexual innuendo.</p><p>She nodded, her grin fading as he unfastened his jeans, then made a production of slowly lowering the zipper, sliding the jeans down over his hips, kicking them out of the way.</p><p>Clad in nothing but a pair of black silk briefs, he moved toward the bed. His feet made no sound on the hardwood floor as he stalked toward her, lithe and dangerous as a jungle cat.</p> <p>She laughed when he growled low in his throat.</p><p>\u201cJungle cat, eh?\u201d he mused.</p><p>\u201cStop reading my mind. It isn\u2019t fair!\u201d</p><p>He slid under the covers beside her and drew her into his arms. \u201cAre you sure you want me to stop? If I did, I wouldn\u2019t know how much you like it when I touch you here...\u201d His hand caressed the sensitive skin of her inner thigh. \u201cOr kiss you there...\u201d Bending his head, he brushed his lips across her breast.</p><p>Megan sighed as the heat of his mouth warmed her skin.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re overdressed,\u201d he murmured, and in a blur of movement, he removed her nightgown and tossed it on the floor. \u201cThat\u2019s better.\u201d</p> <p>She looked up at him, marveling anew at how remarkable he was. He was a man like no other she had ever known, a creature of myth and legend, and she loved him more than life itself. Wanted him beyond words. Locking her arms around his neck, she whispered, \u201cWhat am I thinking now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall I tell you?\u201d He nuzzled her breast. \u201cOr show you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard?\u201d She slid her hand down his hard, flat belly, her fingertips tracing the narrow line of hair that disappeared beneath his briefs. \u201cActions speak louder than words.\u201d</p><p>Chuckling softly, he wrapped his arms around her. \u201cAh, fair lady, my only purpose in life is to fulfill your every wish, your every desire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you\u2019d stop talking and kiss me.\u201d</p><p>The words had scarcely left her lips when his mouth covered hers. He kissed her slow and deep and then, with a low growl, he rained kisses along her neck and the valley between her breasts before returning to her mouth. His tongue sought hers, an intimate caress that spread through her like lightning.</p><p>He kissed her until she could hardly catch her breath and then he drew back, a wicked grin curving his lips. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to faint on me, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly,\u201d she retorted, and then she frowned. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve actually made women swoon?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShall I show you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d she said primly.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to stop now, are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope not.\u201d She tugged at the waistband of his briefs. \u201cWho\u2019s overdressed now?\u201d</p><p>He was out of them in an instant, boldly displaying the evidence of his desire. \u201cWhat now, my lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I have to tell you everything?\u201d With an exaggerated sigh, she flung her arms out to her sides, a smile playing over her lips. \u201cJust do what you do best.\u201d</p><p>His gaze moved quickly to the pulse throbbing in the hollow of her throat.</p><p>\u201cI give you leave to taste,\u201d she said, her voice a whisper. \u201cBut only a taste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, my lady. I will do my best to obey.\u201d Gathering her into his arms, he kissed her again, his mouth hot against her skin as he caressed her, his hands and lips arousing her until her whole body thrummed with need.</p><p>Megan murmured his name, her pleasure increasing when she felt the prick of his fangs at her throat, and then she was lost, floating in a world without time, without boundaries, where nothing existed except the two of them. It was a sensation like no other, and, for that one moment, when her desire melded with his, she didn\u2019t care if he took one sip or if he took it all, as long as they were bound together, body and soul. As long as she was a part of him.</p><p>Rhys made love to her all night long, every kiss, every caress branded in his mind, memories he would carry with him for the rest of his existence when, at last, he told her good-bye.</p><p>Chapter 44</p><p>As so often happened after a marathon night of lovemaking, Megan woke with a smile on her face. She was getting good at judging the time, she mused as she sat up, stretching. Without checking her watch, she knew it was late afternoon. A rush of tenderness engulfed her when she looked at Rhys, lying peacefully beside her. Was there ever such a lover as he? Tireless, inventive, always careful to see to her pleasure before his own.</p><p>Leaning down, she kissed his cheek ever so lightly, then slid out of bed. He didn\u2019t stir, but she wasn\u2019t surprised. Surely even a vampire needed his rest after a night such as they had shared.</p><p>She was wishing for a change of clothes when she glanced toward the closet. The door was open, and when she looked inside, she found some of her own clothes hanging there. Bless the man. Sometime in the wee small hours of the morning he had gone to her house and raided her closet.</p><p>Humming softly, she pulled a sweater and a pair of jeans from the hangers. Wondering if he had thought to bring her clean underwear, she opened one of the dresser drawers and found a week\u2019s worth of bras and panties. Carrying her clothing into the bathroom, she closed the door and turned on the shower.</p><p>Sometime later, her hair freshly washed and her teeth brushed, she dressed and went downstairs. All that loving had left her famished, and she raided the refrigerator, munching on a handful of blueberries while she debated what to have for breakfast. In the end, she cooked a waffle and two strips of bacon, and washed it all down with a glass of orange juice. After cleaning up the kitchen, she poured herself a cup of coffee and carried it into the living room.</p><p>Curling up on the sofa, she sipped the coffee, wondering how long it would be until she could go home again. She refused to think that Rhys might lose the battle with Villagrande. Instead, she skipped ahead to the time when the fight was over and Rhys was the victor. He had asked her to marry him, and she had said yes. Sitting there, a cup of coffee in her hand and the sun shining brightly, she let herself think about the kind of wedding she wanted. Something simple yet elegant. Of course, it would have to be in the evening. Refreshments would be light, since the groom and his guests wouldn\u2019t be eating.</p><p>Better to just elope. They could go to Vegas and get married there. Erik and Daisy could stand up with them, and when it was done, Megan could call her parents and tell them the good news. Her mother would be hurt, perhaps angry, that her only daughter had eloped, but in the long run, it would be easier than trying to explain why she wasn\u2019t having a big wedding with six bridesmaids, an orchestra, and a sit-down dinner.</p><p>Megan blew out a sigh. She should call her parents. Still, she hesitated as she imagined telling them she was getting married. What could she say? Hi, Mom. Dad. Guess what? I\u2019m in love with a vampire and as soon as he destroys the bad guy, we\u2019re getting married.</p><p>Megan chewed on her thumbnail. How could she explain why Rhys never went out in the sun or why he didn\u2019t eat? How long could she make excuses for his odd behavior before her parents got suspicious?</p><p>When the trouble with Villagrande was over, she would have to go up to Redding and spend a few days with her folks. After all, news like this really should be related in person, at least the part about getting married. The vampire part would have to wait.</p><p>A subtle shift in the atmosphere told her that the sun was going down, and the vampires were rising. She knew Rhys would be the first to appear. She could sense his presence in her very bones, and even as she tried to understand how that could be, he was there, striding toward her. And she was smiling, her heart lifting at the sight of him.</p><p>She went into his arms gladly, a warm sense of contentment and belonging sweeping over her as he drew her close. His lips moved in her hair, his breath warm as he whispered that he loved her.</p><p>\u201cI knew you were coming,\u201d she said, her voice muffled against his chest. \u201cEven before I saw you, I knew you were nearby. How is that possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the blood link we share. It grows stronger every time you share your blood with me.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him. \u201cAm I going to turn into a vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, love. Not unless you want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you love me more if I was like you?\u201d</p><p>Hope sparked in the depths of his eyes. \u201cMegan!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get any ideas!\u201d she said, pushing him away. \u201cI didn\u2019t say I wanted to be a vampire. I just wondered if you\u2019d love me more if I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you more every day.\u201d He drew her into his embrace once more. \u201cMortal or vampire, it doesn\u2019t matter to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ll grow old...\u201d</p><p>Rhys covered her mouth with his hand. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d At any rate, he wouldn\u2019t be there to see it. If he were an honorable man, he would tell her now that he intended to leave her as soon as Villagrande had been taken care of, but he didn\u2019t want to face the consequences. He knew she would object, perhaps strenuously. She might insist on going home, and he couldn\u2019t allow that. Better to say nothing, he decided, and enjoy whatever time together they had left.</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry,\u201d Daisy said, entering the room, \u201cwe didn\u2019t mean to interrupt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a bed upstairs, you know,\u201d Erik said, his voice tinged with amusement.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d Rhys retorted good-naturedly. \u201cLike you never kissed Daisy in the living room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, not when we had company,\u201d Erik said, winking at Daisy. \u201cWe\u2019re going out for\u201d\u2014he glanced at Megan and grinned\u2014\u201ca bite, you should excuse the expression. We won\u2019t be gone long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want anything from the store?\u201d Daisy asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMaybe some chocolate ice cream,\u201d Megan said. \u201cAnd a box of brownie mix.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could I have forgotten chocolate!\u201d Daisy exclaimed with a grin. \u201cIt\u2019s a staple in every woman\u2019s diet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBehave yourselves while we\u2019re gone,\u201d Erik said. Taking Daisy by the hand, they vanished from sight.</p> <p>\u201cI wish I could just disappear like that,\u201d Megan exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cI can arrange it. Just say the word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to nag me about becoming a vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould it help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m happy just as I am, thank you very much.\u201d And so saying, she flounced into the kitchen and poured herself a glass of grapefruit juice.</p> <p>Rhys followed, of course. Standing in the doorway, he couldn\u2019t help admiring her softly rounded buttocks, the curve of her breasts, the way her hair framed her face. The flowery scent of her perfume mingled with her own unique scent, teasing his senses. How was he ever going to let her go?</p><p>Seeing him, Megan lifted the glass in a silent toast. \u201cI like eating and drinking too much to give it up. And even though you won\u2019t admit it, you must miss it. How could you not?\u201d</p><p>He snorted softly. \u201cAfter five centuries, I don\u2019t remember what any of it tastes like.\u201d</p><p>She leaned back against the counter. \u201cDid you miss it after you were first turned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. The scent of cooked meat was nauseating. Fruits and vegetables held no appeal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you drink wine. Red, of course.\u201d</p> <p>He chuckled softly. \u201cYes, the redder the better. It\u2019s the only thing I can drink.\u201d Seeing her look of wry amusement, he added, \u201cOther than the obvious, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Turning toward the sink, she rinsed out the glass and put it in the dishwasher. The machine must have come with the house, she mused, since she couldn\u2019t think of any reason why vampires would need a dishwasher or any other appliances, for that matter. Facing Rhys again, she said, \u201cI wonder why you can drink wine.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI have no idea.\u201d He didn\u2019t tell her that, among vampires, it was a common practice to add a little fresh blood to the fruit of the vine.</p><p>\u201cAre you going out later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Closing the distance between them, he drew her into his arms. \u201cI fed earlier.\u201d Before Megan came into his life, he had only fed once a week or so, sometimes less. The hunger, insatiable and irresistible in new vampires, burned less hot with each passing year, though there were circumstances that sparked that primal need. Lovemaking was one of them. Unwilling to put Megan\u2019s life at risk, afraid of losing control when they made love, he was careful to feed each night.</p><p>Megan locked her hands around his neck; then, rising on her tiptoes, she kissed him because he was so close, because she couldn\u2019t be near him and not want him. Because she loved him.</p><p>She was startled when, with a low growl, he crushed her body against his. His tongue plundered her mouth, hot and wild, as he backed her up against the wall, sending waves of sensual heat to her very core. Suddenly desperate to have him, she wrapped her legs around his waist, a groan rising in her throat.</p><p>\u201cNow, Rhys,\u201d she said, gasping. \u201cNow!\u201d</p> <p>Muttering an oath, he dragged his mouth from hers and set her on her feet just as Erik walked through the back door carrying a sack of groceries. Daisy and Alex were right behind him.</p><p>A rush of embarrassment heated Megan\u2019s cheeks when Erik said, ever so dryly, \u201cI knew we should have knocked.\u201d</p><p>Megan kept her back to the others. How was she ever going to face these people again?</p><p>\u201cNothing to be embarrassed about, Megan,\u201d Erik said cheerfully as he set the bag on the counter. \u201cSex is a fact of life, you know. We all do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she replied, her voice muffled against Rhys\u2019s chest, \u201cbut not in someone else\u2019s kitchen.\u201d Not in front of two vampires and a man she had only met once before.</p><p>Glancing over Megan\u2019s shoulder, Rhys said, \u201cYou wanna give us a few minutes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Daisy said, and followed her husband out of the room.</p><p>\u201cYou might want to put that ice cream away before it melts,\u201d Alex said as he sauntered toward the door. \u201cThere\u2019s enough sexual heat in here to melt iron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that was humiliating,\u201d Megan remarked as she put the ice cream in the freezer. Delving into the sack again, she saw that Daisy had thoughtfully included a can of whipped cream and a jar of hot fudge.</p><p>\u201cIt could have been worse,\u201d Rhys said with a grin.</p><p>Tossing a bag of cookies into the cupboard, she muttered, \u201cI suppose.\u201d Five minutes later, and they would have been caught in the act.</p><p>Laughing softly, he took her by the hand. \u201cCome on, darlin\u2019, you can\u2019t hide in the kitchen forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanna bet?\u201d Reluctantly, she accompanied him into the living room.</p><p>Erik, Daisy, and Alex were sitting on the sofa. Avoiding their eyes, Megan sat on the love seat. Rhys sat beside her.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he said, \u201cwhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe ran into Alex at the market. I think you should hear what he has to say.\u201d The seriousness in Daisy\u2019s tone told Megan it could only be bad news.</p><p>Rhys leaned forward. \u201cSpit it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t had any vampire trouble since you left town,\u201d Alex said. \u201cUntil last night. I met a friend of mine who\u2019s a hunter. He said an entire family was found drained of blood out on Centre Street.\u201d Alex took a deep breath. \u201cThe youngest victim was only six months old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s awful!\u201d Daisy exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cDamn right,\u201d Erik said.</p><p>Megan stared at Rhys. A muscle worked in his jaw, his hands were clenched. \u201cDo you know who did it?\u201d he asked, his voice grim.</p><p>Alex shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. But it was clearly a vampire. He didn\u2019t bother to make it look like anything else.\u201d</p><p>Rhys stood. \u201cI need the address.\u201d</p><p>Megan sprang to her feet. \u201cYou\u2019re not thinking of going there!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to know if it\u2019s Villagrande.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could it be?\u201d she asked. \u201cHow could he know where we are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have known leaving LA would be a waste of time,\u201d Rhys said quietly, almost as if he was talking to himself. \u201cVillagrande\u2019s the oldest of our kind. We\u2019ve been kidding ourselves, thinking we could hide from him. I have a feeling he\u2019s there, waiting for me.\u201d</p><p>Megan grasped his arm. \u201cYou can\u2019t go. I won\u2019t let you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I can talk to him, tell him to keep LA.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what if that\u2019s not enough anymore?\u201d Erik glanced at Megan.</p><p>She knew what he was thinking. It wasn\u2019t just about territory now. Villagrande was angry because she had destroyed Shirl.</p><p>\u201cIf he wants a life for a life,\u201d Rhys said, \u201cI\u2019ll give him mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Fear for Rhys, fear for her own life, leeched the strength from Megan\u2019s legs, and she dropped down on the love seat. \u201cI\u2019m the one who killed Shirl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t open to discussion, Megan,\u201d Rhys said, his voice gruff. \u201cI told you before, this is between Villagrande and me. No one else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know you can\u2019t face him alone,\u201d Erik said. \u201cHell, I\u2019m not sure the five of us together can beat him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s so old,\u201d Daisy remarked, a note of awe in her voice. \u201cWho knows, maybe he is indestructible.\u201d With a shake of her head, she murmured, \u201cMaybe he really is immortal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly one way to find out,\u201d Alex said with a cocky grin.</p><p>\u201cThe address,\u201d Rhys said, his voice sharp. \u201cI want it now.\u201d</p><p>With an apologetic glance at Megan, Alex gave Rhys the street address.</p><p>Before she could beg him not to go, Rhys was gone. Springing to her feet, she cried, \u201cErik, you\u2019ve got to go with him! Please! You said it yourself, he doesn\u2019t stand a chance alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right,\u201d Alex said, pumping his arm in the air. \u201cErik, let\u2019s you and me go kick some vampire ass.\u201d</p><p>Megan sighed and glanced at her watch. It seemed like Rhys, Erik, and Alex had been gone for hours.</p><p>She was about to ask Daisy how she could appear so calm when her husband might be fighting Villagrande at that very moment, when Daisy suddenly rose to her feet.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Megan asked, her mind filling with horrible possibilities.</p><p>\u201cI thought I heard Erik calling me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would he do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe something\u2019s gone wrong.\u201d Daisy moved toward the front door. \u201cErik?\u201d</p><p>Rising, Megan walked up behind Daisy. \u201cI don\u2019t hear anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s calling me,\u201d Daisy said, her brow furrowing.</p><p>\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he come inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s badly hurt. He...oh, no!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Megan asked anxiously. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMegan, I\u2019m so sorry. He said Alex is badly hurt and...and Rhys is dead.\u201d</p><p>Megan pressed her hand to her chest as the room began to spin. Rhys was dead...dead...dead. \u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it....\u201d</p><p>A high-pitched cry came from outside. Shouting Erik\u2019s name, Daisy opened the door and dashed out into the night.</p><p>Megan started after her, only to come to an abrupt halt as a dark shape filled the doorway.</p><p>Before her mind could register what she was seeing, pain exploded through her head and everything went black.</p><p>Chapter 45</p><p>Rhys stood in the shadows on Centre Street, his senses reaching out toward the brown-and-beige, two-story Colonial house. The yard was well kept, the lawn green, with a few shrubs in front. Five steps climbed to the front porch. Rose bushes grew on either side of the stairs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The stink of death shrouded the place. Under the stench of fear and blood, the unmistakable smell of vampire lingered in the air. A distant part of his mind wondered how Villagrande had gained entrance to the house.</p><p>A thought carried Rhys into the living room. He wouldn\u2019t have been able to enter the house uninvited if the family had still been alive, but murder had been done here, destroying the threshold\u2019s basic protection. He had no need of an invitation. And no need to wonder further how Villagrande had gained entrance. The blood splattered on the floor inside the entryway told the tale. Someone had unwittingly invited Villagrande inside. And died because of it.</p><p>Rhys moved silently through the dark rooms, following Villagrande\u2019s trail. The vampire had struck the four other members of the family while they slept, as evidenced by the blood-stained sheets and blankets carelessly tossed over the bodies.</p><p>Rhys lingered in the nursery where the last murder had occurred. The room was decorated with fairy wallpaper and pictures of Tinker Bell. The baby had died last. A Tinker Bell quilt, bright with blood, covered the dead infant. A Peter Pan lamp stood on the dresser beside a framed photo of a woman holding a baby. The mother and child? The woman was young and pretty, with dark brown hair and hazel eyes. The baby was rosy-cheeked and blue-eyed.</p> <p>Rhys swore softly. He had done some pretty despicable things in the course of his existence, but he had never killed an infant. Would he do such a thing if he existed as long as Villagrande? Would he view mortals as nothing but prey, his to do with as he pleased? The thought brought him up short and with it came the realization that he was close to feeling that way now. Or he had been, until Megan had come into his life. She had reminded him of how frail mortals were, how tenuous and precious their hold on life.</p><p>Megan. Needing to know she was all right, he closed his eyes, concentrating on the bond between them, and felt nothing. Only two things could prevent him from linking with her; she was either unconscious, or dead.</p><p>Before he could determine which, he sensed Villagrande\u2019s approach. An instant later, the vampire materialized in the room. Preternatural power radiated from him, enhanced by the fresh blood he had recently consumed.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Tom\u00e1s said. \u201cWe end it, now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat have you done with Megan?\u201d</p> <p>A smile that was pure evil spread across Villagrande\u2019s face. \u201cYou\u2019ll never know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit, where is she? What have you done to her?\u201d He couldn\u2019t ask the question uppermost in his mind. Couldn\u2019t ask if she was dead, afraid that saying it aloud might make it so.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Villagrande spread one hand over his heart. \u201cI\u2019ve done nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play games with me, you bastard. Where is she?\u201d</p><p>Villagrande rocked back on his heels. \u201cShe killed Shirl. She wounded me. I will have my revenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Dammit, if you want a life, take mine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI intend to.\u201d</p><p>Rhys glared at the other vampire, his mind racing. How had Villagrande managed to bypass the safeguards on Delacourt\u2019s house? And having done so, what had he done to Erik, Daisy, and Alex? Had he destroyed them all?</p><p>The thought had scarcely crossed his mind when Erik and Alex appeared in the room.</p><p>Villagrande looked at them and laughed. \u201cThree against one, Costain? Hardly sporting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to have to fight you,\u201d Rhys said. \u201cTake the West Coast. Take my life. Just spare Megan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late to make deals.\u201d Villagrande\u2019s gaze swept over the three of them. \u201cYou have all defied me,\u201d he declared imperiously. \u201cAnd the penalty is death.\u201d And with that ultimatum, he sprang toward Rhys, fangs bared, hands transforming into lethal claws.</p><p>Baring his own fangs, Erik leaped onto Villagrande\u2019s back, but Villagrande shook him off, like a pit bull shaking off a rat. Erik slammed into Alex, and the two of them sailed through the air, a tangle of arms and legs as they hit the wall, hard.</p><p>Rhys charged toward Villagrande, the only thought in his mind to destroy the vampire who threatened Megan\u2019s life. They came together in a furious rush. Villagrande\u2019s power lashed out at Rhys with the force of a tornado.</p> <p>Rhys was hardly aware of the pain as Villagrande\u2019s teeth and claws savaged his neck and chest. The physical pain was as nothing compared to the ache in his heart at the thought that Megan might be dead. If she was dead, it was all his fault. He never should have drawn her into his life.</p><p>He knew a moment of respite when Erik leaped into the fray again, momentarily drawing Villagrande away.</p><p>Alex crawled toward Rhys, his left arm dangling uselessly at his side. Holding out his good arm, he said, \u201cDrink.\u201d</p><p>Rhys didn\u2019t argue. With a low growl, he buried his fangs in the other man\u2019s wrist. He didn\u2019t have time to take much, but even a little helped. He spared hardly a glance for Delacourt, who lay facedown on the floor. There was no time to worry about Delacourt, no time to think of anything but his own survival. He refused to believe Megan was dead. She was out there, somewhere, and she needed him. It was that thought that gave him the strength to meet Villagrande\u2019s next attack.</p><p>They battled in silence, fangs and claws shredding cloth and flesh alike. The air was thick with preternatural power and the coppery scent of blood.</p><p>Breathing hard, Rhys fell back. Blood flowed freely from numerous bites and gashes on his face, neck, chest, and back.</p><p>With his heightened senses came an increased ability to feel pain and he felt it now with every movement he made, felt his strength ebbing. Wounds that should have healed quickly continued to bleed; the more blood he lost, the weaker he would become. His whole body screamed in protest when he moved.</p><p>Villagrande stared at him, a smug smile on his face. He had won, and he knew it.</p><p>Rhys took a deep breath. He couldn\u2019t lose. If he did, it was like signing a death warrant for Delacourt and Alex, although he wasn\u2019t sure if Delacourt was even still alive. Alex lay slumped in the corner, his pale face streaked with blood.</p><p>Dammit, he couldn\u2019t quit now. Summoning Megan\u2019s image, Rhys gathered what strength he had left. He was about to charge Villagrande when Daisy and Megan materialized in the room.</p><p>Rhys swore, his overwhelming relief at seeing Megan alive warring with his anger at Daisy for bringing her here.</p><p>Villagrande looked at the two women, then threw back his head and laughed. \u201cCostain and Delacourt for dinner,\u201d he crowed. \u201cAnd two plump females for dessert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that right?\u201d Megan exclaimed. \u201cWell, eat this!\u201d Pulling a stake from the folds of her skirt, she sprang forward, the stake aimed at Villagrande\u2019s chest.</p><p>Daisy was moving, too. Taking a bottle from her pocket, she threw the contents in Villagrande\u2019s face.</p><p>Rhys knew a moment of hope. Was it possible that Daisy and Megan had accomplished what he couldn\u2019t? But no. With a roar of pain and outrage, Villagrande backhanded Daisy, sending her flying across the room. Her head struck a corner of the dresser, and she crumpled to the floor beside her brother.</p><p>In a move faster than the eye could follow, Villagrande grabbed the stake from Megan\u2019s hand. He tossed it aside; then, grabbing Megan by the throat, he lifted her off her feet. \u201cPerhaps I\u2019ll have dessert first,\u201d he said with a growl.</p><p>There was a sudden rush of movement as Erik regained consciousness. A wild cry rose in his throat when he saw Daisy sprawled on the floor, her hair stained with blood from a gash on the back of her head.</p><p>Villagrande dropped Megan and spun around to face Delacourt.</p><p>And in that one instant, when Villagrande was distracted, Rhys snatched the hawthorn stake from the floor and drove it into the vampire\u2019s back. It sliced through Tom\u00e1s Villagrande\u2019s ancient preternatural flesh like a hot knife through butter, piercing his black heart. Blood fountained from the wound in a crimson arc, spraying over the room\u2019s inhabitants, as well as the walls, the ceiling, and the floor.</p><p>Villagrande turned on Rhys with a scream of rage, his eyes as wide and red as the depths of hell. And then, as if someone had jerked his legs out from under him, he toppled to the floor and lay still.</p><p>Megan ran toward Rhys, her face fish-belly white. \u201cIs he dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d Rhys murmured.</p><p>And even as he spoke the words, Villagrande\u2019s body began to shrink in on itself, the flesh melting away, the bones disintegrating, until there was nothing left but dust.</p><p>\u201cHoly crap!\u201d Cradling his broken arm, Alex limped over to stand beside Rhys. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAshes to ashes, dust to dust,\u201d Megan whispered, and buried her face against Rhys\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>He ran his hand up and down her back. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will be.\u201d Rhys glanced over his shoulder to where Delacourt was kneeling beside Daisy. \u201cHow is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Daisy said. \u201cAlex, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, other than my wounded pride, my sprained ankle, and my broken arm, yeah, I\u2019m okay.\u201d He looked at his sister, at Erik, and at Rhys, then looked at Megan. \u201cI\u2019m thinking, as the only two humans in the room, that we should make ourselves scarce for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked, frowning, and then, suddenly aware that all three vampires needed blood, she said, \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Rhys glared at Alex. \u201cDo you really think we\u2019d feed off you?\u201d</p><p>Alex snorted. \u201cDelacourt\u2019s done it before. And I seem to remember you gnawing on my arm just a few minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t feeding,\u201d Rhys said, scowling.</p><p>\u201cAll right, that\u2019s enough,\u201d Daisy said, pushing herself to her feet. \u201cThis is what we\u2019re going to do. We\u2019ll transport Megan and Alex to the nearest hospital. Megan will stay with him while the rest of us go and, uh, get cleaned up. And then we\u2019ll meet back at the hospital. All right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho put you in charge, Daisy Mae?\u201d Alex asked.</p><p>\u201cHave you got a better idea?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, I guess not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s settled then,\u201d Daisy said. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Megan looked up at Rhys. \u201cYou can drink from me if you want.\u201d</p> <p>Rhys shook his head. \u201cI need more than you can spare.\u201d He ran his knuckles over her cheek. \u201cWhat happened? I couldn\u2019t sense you anywhere. I thought...\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cI thought you were dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re fine,\u201d Daisy said, smiling. \u201cIt\u2019s the zombies that are dead. I think Villagrande sent them after us, maybe just to keep us out of the way, or maybe...\u201d She shrugged. \u201cWho knows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the zombies?\u201d Megan asked.</p><p>Daisy looked at her as if she wasn\u2019t very bright.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs soon as they were out of the way, I grabbed you and transported us here and that, as they say, is that.\u201d</p><p>Alex cleared his throat. \u201cDo you think you two could reminisce about that later? I\u2019m in a bit of pain here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Rhys muttered. He glanced at Erik and Daisy. \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he said, and wrapping his arms around Megan, he transported the two of them to the hospital.</p><p>Moments later, Erik, Alex, and Daisy materialized beside them.</p><p>Daisy smiled at her brother. \u201cMake up a good story,\u201d she said. \u201cYou used to be aces at that when we were kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he muttered. \u201cCatch ya later.\u201d</p> <p>Megan looked up at Rhys. \u201cBe careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. Ask the doctor to check you over while you\u2019re in there.\u201d</p><p>She rubbed her hand over his cheek. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Come on, Alex,\u201d she said, slipping her arm around his waist, \u201clet\u2019s go get you patched up.\u201d</p><p>Rhys shook his head as he watched Megan help Alex up the driveway toward the emergency room entrance. She was quite a woman.</p><p>\u201cCostain?\u201d</p><p>He answered Erik without taking his gaze from Megan. \u201cNot now.\u201d</p><p>Erik took Daisy\u2019s hand in his and gave it a squeeze. \u201cWe\u2019ll meet you back here in, oh, say, half an hour, all right?\u201d</p><p>Rhys nodded, his attention still on Megan. No matter how long he lived, he knew he would never see her like again. She was everything a man could want in a woman\u2014kind, caring, with a loving heart and a generous nature, and he knew that, from this night on, his existence would never be the same. Leaving her would be the hardest thing he had ever done, but it was best for both of them. When he was gone, her life would go back to normal and so, he thought glumly, would his.</p> <p>He watched her until she was out of sight, and then he melted into the darkness, where he belonged.</p><p>Chapter 46</p><p>Feeling chilly, Megan wrapped her arms around her middle. It had been a heck of a night. Alex hadn\u2019t wanted to stay in the hospital, but the doctor had insisted. In addition to his broken arm and sprained ankle, Alex had two broken ribs and a possible concussion.</p><p>Rhys had told her to have the doctor check her over, too, but there had been no need for that as far as she was concerned. She didn\u2019t have any broken bones, and there was no cure for the nightmares she was likely to have.</p><p>Tapping her foot, she glanced up and down the street. Where was Rhys? Hadn\u2019t he and the others agreed to meet back here in half an hour? Had she been mistaken? Or maybe it had just taken them longer to get cleaned up. Cleaned up, indeed. She knew what that meant. They had all gone to feed. Good grief, she was hanging out with vampires. Megan shook her head. After all she had seen and heard, did Daisy really think she was such a nervous Nelly that she couldn\u2019t handle the truth?</p><p>Megan scrubbed her hands up and down her arms as a chill wind blew down the street. Of all the times to be without a cell phone, she thought impatiently, and then lifted a hand to her head. She had a bump the size of a goose egg where the zombie had hit her. She was, she thought, lucky to be alive.</p><p>She almost jumped out of her skin when Daisy and Erik appeared seemingly from out of nowhere. Even in the faint glow of the lights that lined the driveway, Megan could see that they had both fed and fed well.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Rhys?\u201d Daisy asked, glancing around. \u201cI thought he\u2019d be back by now.\u201d</p><p>A horrible sense of foreboding settled over Megan. Closing her eyes, she tried to find the bond she shared with Rhys, but there was nothing there. Only emptiness.</p><p>When she opened her eyes, the look on Erik\u2019s face, the pity in his eyes, turned her stomach cold.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said, putting his arm around her. \u201cWe\u2019ll take you home.\u201d</p><p>Before Megan realized what was happening, she was standing in her own living room.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you sit down?\u201d Erik suggested. \u201cDaisy, would you bring her a glass of water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want a glass of water or anything else,\u201d Megan said, her voice brittle. \u201cI just want to know what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you sit down?\u201d Erik repeated.</p><p>Megan sat on the edge of the sofa, her hands tightly folded in her lap. \u201cHe\u2019s left me, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Erik nodded. \u201cI\u2019m afraid so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why? It\u2019s over. Villagrande\u2019s not a threat anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s afraid for you,\u201d Erik explained. \u201cAfraid of what might happen in the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, just like that, it\u2019s over?\u201d</p><p>Erik\u2019s gaze slid away from hers.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t he come and tell me all this himself?\u201d</p><p>Erik shrugged. \u201cThat should be obvious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never took him for a coward,\u201d Megan said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he was only thinking of you,\u201d Daisy said. \u201cYou\u2019ll always be in danger as long as your life is tied up with his. It\u2019s one of the reasons vampires rarely get involved with mortals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that right?\u201d Megan asked, her anger rising. \u201cThen how do you explain the two of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said rarely, not never. It happens from time to time. But such pairings aren\u2019t usually successful unless...\u201d Daisy looked at Erik and smiled.</p><p>\u201cUnless the mortal becomes a vampire,\u201d Megan said. \u201cIs that what you\u2019re trying to say?\u201d Rhys had left her. She couldn\u2019t think about it anymore, not now, when the hurt was so fresh. And so she changed the subject. \u201cWhy did Villagrande send zombies after us tonight?\u201d Zombies. Megan shook her head. Even now, it was hard to comprehend.</p><p>\u201cFor no good reason, I\u2019m sure.\u201d Erik smiled at his wife. \u201cWhatever his reasons, I guess he underestimated your powers.\u201d</p><p>Daisy made a face at him. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I was so stupid. As soon as I went outside, I knew I\u2019d made a mistake. While I was dispatching one of the zombies, the other one got inside and knocked Megan unconscious. By the time I got back in the house, the zombie had Megan slung over his shoulder and was heading for the back door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe such creatures exist,\u201d Megan said.</p><p>\u201cOh, they exist all right,\u201d Erik said. \u201cBut they\u2019re not too bright.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you...? Never mind,\u201d Megan decided. \u201cI don\u2019t want to know.\u201d Zombies had once been human. Did they return to normal when whoever held them in thrall released them? Or did they remain mindless creatures with no will of their own?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s late,\u201d Daisy said, patting Megan\u2019s hand. \u201cYou should get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>Sleep? After the last few days, she didn\u2019t think she would ever get another peaceful night\u2019s sleep. And even as the thought crossed her mind, she was yawning.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll stay until morning, if you don\u2019t want to be alone,\u201d Erik offered.</p><p>The idea was appealing. But rather than seem cowardly, Megan shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ll be all right, but thank you, both of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got our number,\u201d Daisy said, giving Megan a hug. \u201cCall if you need us.\u201d</p><p>Megan nodded. She started to rise, intending to walk Daisy and Erik to the door, but they were gone in a swirl of twinkling blue and dove gray motes before she gained her feet.</p><p>\u201cA neat trick,\u201d she murmured, and burst into tears.</p><p>Thursday morning dawned cold, gray, and gloomy, the perfect setting for Megan\u2019s misery. She had cried most of the night, hadn\u2019t slept more than an hour or two at most, which explained why she woke with a headache and eyes that felt like they were filled with sand.</p><p>It seemed strange to wake in her own bed in her own room. Strange to know she was alone in the house. The nightmare was over. Tom\u00e1s Villagrande had been destroyed. Erik and Daisy had returned to Boston. And Rhys...? Where was he? Knowing it was useless, she tried to open the link between them, but it was like trying to call a number that had been disconnected. No one was there.</p><p>Rising, she stepped into her slippers and plodded downstairs to make a pot of coffee. When it was done, she sat at the table staring into her favorite Grumpy coffee cup and wishing she could just disappear. How was she supposed to go back to her old, boring life after having known Rhys? Yes, he was dangerous. Yes, being around him was risky. But as scary as it had sometimes been, being with him had made her feel vibrant and alive. And she loved him as she would never love anyone else.</p><p>She carried her coffee cup into the living room and switched on the TV. Talk about a vast wasteland. Did anyone even watch TV in the morning? There was nothing on but black-robed judges trying to look important while they ruled on mundane cases, cheerful talk show hosts who discussed even more mundane topics, ubiquitous soap operas, and mindless cartoons. Where had all the good shows gone?</p><p>She refilled her cup twice and then, deciding she couldn\u2019t just sit around in her pj\u2019s and mope all day, she called Mr. Parker and told him she was back in town and that she would be at work that night. Early.</p><p>It turned out to be the best decision she could have made. Mr. Parker was genuinely happy to see her again. Being back at work, talking to people who didn\u2019t drink blood or disappear in the blink of an eye helped to ground her in the real world again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Shore\u2019s was having its once-a-year sale, which meant they were even busier than usual, for which Megan was grateful. She didn\u2019t have any time to think of anything\u2014or anyone\u2014else.</p><p>It was after eleven when Drexel swaggered into Shore\u2019s. Clad in a fluorescent pink shirt, black velvet vest, and skintight black pants, he was a sight to behold. His face lit up brighter than his shirt when he saw Megan.</p><p>\u201cBabe!\u201d he exclaimed as he wrapped her in a bear hug. \u201cI\u2019m so glad to see you!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks, Drexel. I missed you, too,\u201d she said, and meant it. \u201cHey, I thought you were going on tour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe cut it short.\u201d</p><p>Extricating herself from his embrace, she asked, \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust my head. Ever since the fire, I\u2019ve been having trouble performing on a stage unless it\u2019s outside. My shrink says it\u2019ll pass, in time. He says I should take a vacation, so that\u2019s what I\u2019m gonna do. So, I need some new threads, something hip but subdued, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure we can find something that will work.\u201d</p> <p>Ninety minutes and nine thousand dollars later, Drexel pulled her into another exuberant hug. \u201cThanks, babe. Just seeing you makes me feel better.\u201d He smiled at her, though it didn\u2019t quite reach his eyes. \u201cSo, babe, have you decided to marry me yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrexel...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you think I\u2019m too young and that I\u2019m just kiddin\u2019 around, and that I don\u2019t really mean it, but if you say yes, I\u2019ll make you the happiest woman in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sweet, really, but I wouldn\u2019t be good for you or anyone else right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened, Megan? Some guy hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a way.\u201d Lifting a hand, Megan caressed his cheek. \u201cIf I was going to marry anyone, it would be you.\u201d</p> <p>He laughed at that. \u201cI\u2019ll hold you to it,\u201d he said, and kissed her on the cheek. \u201cSee you soon.\u201d</p><p>Megan stared after him as he left the shop. Maybe she should marry Drexel. He wouldn\u2019t ask much of her, and it would be nice to share her life with someone so uncomplicated, someone who adored her....</p><p>Good grief, what was she thinking? Drexel was nineteen years old. Did she have some kind of perverse weakness for younger men? Rhys might be an old vampire, but physically he was still on the shy side of twenty-one.</p><p>Pain stabbed at her heart when she thought of him. Young or old, right or wrong, she missed him more than she would have thought possible. Why was it, when she had finally met the perfect man, it turned out he wasn\u2019t really a man at all?</p><p>She blinked away her tears as a new customer stepped into the shop. Grateful for the distraction, she hurried toward him.</p><p>The first two weeks without Rhys were the hardest. She went to work early. She offered to come in on her nights off and help Mr. Parker take inventory. She decided to paint her kitchen, and spent a day looking at color swatches before choosing a pale yellow. When that was done, she threw herself into redecorating her bedroom. She painted the walls a pale, pale lavender. Painted the trim and the ceiling white. She bought a new white quilt and a lavender dust ruffle for her bed, then added several throw pillows in varying shades of lavender and purple. She bought new white curtains, and ordered new carpeting, recovered the seat cushion on the desk chair to match the dust ruffle. And when she was finished, she hated it because she couldn\u2019t imagine Rhys being comfortable with all that lavender.</p><p>The next day, she painted the room sky blue, traded the lavender dust ruffle for a white one, exchanged the lavender and purple pillows for blue, and threw her paint roller away.</p><p>Later, standing in the doorway admiring her handiwork, she decided she was going insane.</p> <p>\u201cDefinitely insane,\u201d she muttered, \u201cwhen you worry that a man you\u2019re never going to see again might not like lavender.\u201d</p><p>With a shake of her head, she went in to shower and get ready for work.</p><p>Rhys stood outside Shore\u2019s, avidly watching Megan\u2019s every move. He was jealous of every man who entered the store and talked with her, heard her voice, shared her laughter. It was all he could do to keep from charging in and breaking the neck of the handsome young man she was currently assisting.</p><p>Hands clenched, he took several deep breaths. He had known it would be hard to stay away from her, known he would miss her, but the reality was far worse than anything he had imagined. Standing there, cloaked in the shadows of the night, he decided he was a damn fool; worse, he was a glutton for punishment. He had shared her bed, tasted her blood, asked her to marry him, all the while knowing that they could never have a life together.</p><p>He swore softly. Even with walls and windows separating them, he could detect the flowery perfume of her hair, the warm, womanly scent that was uniquely hers. And her blood...Damn! The vibrant, coppery scent aroused vivid images in his mind\u2014images of the two of them in bed, her body writhing beneath his, her voice crying his name. He licked his lips, remembering the sweet taste of her life\u2019s blood on his tongue, the way it had flowed into him, warming all the cold places in his body as her loving acceptance had warmed the dark, empty hollows of his soul.</p><p>\u201cMegan.\u201d Her name slipped past his lips, as soft and fervent as a prayer.</p><p>Megan glanced at the clock. Almost midnight. Most people called it the witching hour, but at one time, it had been the vampire hour. Unable to help herself, she glanced toward the door, but there was no sign of her vampire. Her vampire. If only that were still true.</p><p>\u201cMiss?\u201d</p><p>She turned, forcing a smile as a tall, good-looking man came toward her. \u201cDo you have this in a size forty-four?\u201d he asked. \u201cI couldn\u2019t find one on the rack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we might have one in the back. Just let me...\u201d Whatever she had been about to say fled her mind with the overwhelming feeling that she was being watched. Pivoting on her heel, Megan stared at the front window, but could see nothing more than a few cars parked at the curb and the lights from the restaurant across the street. But that sense of being watched persisted.</p><p>\u201cMiss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She glanced at her customer, her mind blank. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I...What were you looking for?\u201d</p><p>He held up the navy blazer. \u201cYou were going to see if you had this in my size.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d With a last glance at the front window, Megan went to check the back room.</p><p>The rest of the night went by quickly. Megan couldn\u2019t stifle a sense of disappointment when Mr. Parker locked up after their last client departed. Knowing it was foolish, she still found herself hoping that Rhys would be waiting for her when she went out to her car. She should be used to it by now, but she hated going home to an empty house.</p><p>Thoughts of going home brought Shirl to mind. Thinking of her former best friend brought the sting of tears to her eyes. She quickly wiped them away before Mr. Parker could see them. The last thing she wanted to do was explain why she was crying. She could hardly tell Mr. Parker the truth, and she wasn\u2019t in the mood to think up a plausible lie.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Mr. Parker said, coming up behind her. \u201cIf we do this well tomorrow night, I guess Mary Lou will get that cabin in Big Bear after all.\u201d</p><p>Mary Lou was Mr. Parker\u2019s wife. She was fifteen years younger than he was. They had been married for twelve years, had two sets of twins, and seemed very happy together. Megan couldn\u2019t help envying them.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Mr. Parker said, as he did most every night. \u201cI\u2019ll walk you out.\u201d</p><p>With a nod, Megan grabbed her coat and handbag.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I ever realized just how valuable you are to the business,\u201d Mr. Parker remarked as he unlocked the back door. \u201cTwo of our best customers said they wouldn\u2019t be back until you were. I\u2019d hate to think what would happen if you quit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t see that happening anytime soon,\u201d Megan said. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake care.\u201d</p><p>Megan waved at him; then, with a sigh, she unlocked her car and slid behind the wheel.</p><p>A scream clawed its way out of her throat when she realized she wasn\u2019t alone. \u201cRhys!\u201d She pressed a hand to her thundering heart. \u201cGood Lord, are you trying to scare me to death?\u201d</p><p>She took several slow, deep breaths, her fear quickly replaced by the sheer joy of seeing him again. Her heart did a little somersault when she saw that he was wearing clothes she had sold him. He was as breathtakingly handsome as always, and she reveled in the sight of him.</p><p>After the first rush of happiness, anger reared its ugly head. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d think that would be obvious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d She clasped her hands in her lap to keep from reaching for him. \u201cWhy is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re upset with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUpset? Why on earth would I be upset?\u201d She could hear her voice rising, but she couldn\u2019t help it. What right did he have to leave her without so much as a word of good-bye and then just reappear as if nothing had happened?</p><p>\u201cMegan...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you please get out of my car?\u201d When he didn\u2019t move, she wondered if cars were like houses. Could she rescind her invitation?</p><p>His gaze moved over her face, as warm and tangible as a caress. \u201cThat\u2019s not what you want.\u201d</p><p>She glared at him. \u201cQuit. Reading. My. Mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, I\u2019m sorry, okay? I shouldn\u2019t have taken off the way I did. I know that.\u201d He raked his fingers through his hair. \u201cDammit, Megan, I couldn\u2019t look in your eyes and tell you good-bye. Leaving you was hard enough as it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaisy told me you left because my life would be in danger as long as you and I were together. So, what\u2019s changed? You\u2019re still a vampire, and I\u2019m still human, and unless you\u2019ve figured out a way to become human again...\u201d Her voice trailed off. \u201cPlease, Rhys, just go away. I can\u2019t do this again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMegan.\u201d He caressed her cheek, ever so lightly. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go on without you. I was alone for a long time and content to be so, until I met you. I\u2019m in love with you. That hasn\u2019t changed, and it never will. I know you love me. I know it\u2019s risky for you to stay with me, but maybe if we leave LA, go to a small town where there aren\u2019t any other vampires...\u201d He shrugged. \u201cMaybe we could start over, pretend we\u2019re like any other couple.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was tempting, so tempting. But what if it didn\u2019t work out? Did she want to try again? Risk her heart again?

How could she resist the love she heard in his voice, the longing in his eyes? She had agreed, perhaps rashly, to marry him not long ago. Did she still want that? Did she really want to spend her life with a man she would never understand? Did she want to give up the chance to have a family and live a normal life?</p><p>He was reading her mind again. She could see it in the clenching of his hands, the tightening of his jaw.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I bothered you,\u201d he said, his voice tight. \u201cIt won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, her heart pounding. He was leaving. What if she never saw him again? Did she want to spend the rest of her life without him?</p> <p>Preternatural power filled the air, and she knew that in moments he would vanish from her sight.</p><p>\u201cGood-bye, Megan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She grabbed his arm, realizing in that moment, when he was about to leave her, perhaps forever, that she couldn\u2019t live without him. \u201cDon\u2019t go!\u201d</p><p>She frowned as a slow smile spread across his face. Pulling her hand away from his arm, she glared at him. \u201cThat\u2019s so unfair!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I hate you! You were reading my mind again, weren\u2019t you? You knew I wouldn\u2019t let you go!\u201d</p> <p>Chuckling softly, he reached for her, but she pulled away. \u201cNo, not until you promise to stop reading my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do better than that,\u201d he said, still grinning. \u201cI\u2019ll teach you how to block me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a way to do that?\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me that before?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cBecause I like reading your mind,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI like knowing what you\u2019re thinking about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, can you read everybody\u2019s mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much. In the beginning, it took a lot of concentration to block them all out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan all vampires do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs far as I know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo, how do I block you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to erect a barrier around your mind. Visualize it as a brick wall, or a dam, or some other structure that\u2019s solid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that works?\u201d she asked skeptically.</p><p>\u201cIt takes a lot of practice, but that\u2019s the only way I know.\u201d Seeing the look of concentration on her face, he took her hands in his and gave them a gentle shake. \u201cDo you have to try it now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what do you say we go to your place? I\u2019ll grovel at your feet until you forgive me, and then we can indulge in some hot make-up sex.\u201d</p><p>Megan laughed as she fumbled with her keys. \u201cYou\u2019re incorrigible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d His hand curled over hers. \u201cLeave your car here. I\u2019ve got a lot of groveling to do, and I want to get to the huggin\u2019 and kissin\u2019 before dawn.\u201d</p><p>Before she had time to say ah, yes, or no, they were in her bedroom. Rhys was sitting on the foot of the bed, and she was on his lap.</p><p>\u201cVampires,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Rhys fell back on the mattress, carrying her with him. When they landed, they were lying face-to-face. \u201cBe honest, would you have me any other way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She might wish for him to be human, but if he was, he wouldn\u2019t be the Rhys she had fallen in love with.</p><p>\u201cYou promised to marry me, remember?\u201d His hand slid slowly up and down her back, a gentle caress.</p><p>\u201cHmm, I\u2019m not sure that promise is still valid, since you went off and left me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her body closer to his. \u201cI want you.\u201d</p><p>She could feel the hard evidence of that want against her belly.</p><p>\u201cAnd you want me.\u201d His voice was a low purr in her ear.</p><p>\u201cAre you reading my mind again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I can smell it on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cannot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a sweet, musky scent, guaranteed to drive a man wild.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cAre you wild?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, you\u2019d better believe it.\u201d He bared his fangs. \u201cWant me to show you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Grandma, what big teeth you have.\u201d</p><p>He leered at her. \u201cThat ain\u2019t all that\u2019s big.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna show me that, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill I like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never had any complaints.\u201d Rhys swore softly when she went suddenly quiet. Damn. He didn\u2019t have to read her mind to know she was wondering how many women he had known, how many he had loved. He hoped she wouldn\u2019t ask, but since she was a female, it was inevitable.</p><p>\u201cRhys?\u201d</p><p>He blew out a sigh. Here it comes.</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you something? You don\u2019t have to answer if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can ask me anything.\u201d He was only surprised she hadn\u2019t asked before.</p><p>\u201cHave there been a lot of...Never mind. I don\u2019t think I want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only been one other woman who ever meant anything, Megan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you love her very much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I did. I was a young man, a young vampire back then. I\u2019m not sure how much of what I felt for her was love, and how much was lust, but it was nothing compared to what I feel for you. So, are you still willing to marry me, pretty Megan?\u201d</p><p>Cupping his face in her hands, she closed her eyes and whispered, \u201cRead my mind.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 47</p><p>Megan turned slowly in front of the triple mirror. The dress, long and off-white with fitted sleeves and a square neck edged with lace, made her feel like a fairy-tale princess. What would Rhys think of it?</p><p>They hadn\u2019t talked about when or where they would get married. Hadn\u2019t decided whether to run away to Vegas or stay in town and have a judge perform the ceremony. Either way, she was going to be ridiculously overdressed. Still, a girl only got married for the first time once, and she had always dreamed of a dress exactly like this.</p><p>It was a little after four when she left the bridal shop, the wedding gown in hand. After laying the dress in the backseat of her car, she walked across the street to 31 Flavors and ordered a hot fudge sundae with extra whipped cream and a cherry. Tonight, she and Rhys had a lot to talk about. When and where to get married. Who, if anyone, to invite to the ceremony. Where they would live. As for what would happen when the difference in their ages became impossible to ignore, she refused to think about it. She loved Rhys, and he loved her, and that was all that mattered.</p><p>Megan was smiling when she left 31 Flavors. Humming softly, she started across the street toward her car.</p><p>A loud screech of brakes was her only warning. She screamed once. And then everything went black.</p><p>Rhys jackknifed into a sitting position, Megan\u2019s scream still ringing in his ears, but when he tried to link his mind to hers, he found only emptiness.</p><p>Stone-faced, Evelyn DeLacy stood at her daughter\u2019s bedside, one of Megan\u2019s hands held tightly in her own. George stood on the other side of the bed, tears streaming down his cheeks. Evelyn tried not to look at her husband, tried not to hear his sobs. She had to keep her emotions under control. If she didn\u2019t, she knew she would shatter into a million pieces and, like Humpty Dumpty, they would never be able to put her back together again.</p><p>A drunk sixteen-year-old boy driving a stolen car had hit Megan as she crossed the street. Megan had been in surgery for seven hours. The doctors had told Evelyn and George that if Megan survived the next twenty-four hours, there was a chance that she would recover, though it was unlikely she would ever walk or use her left arm again.</p><p>Evelyn didn\u2019t care about that or anything else. All she wanted was for Megan to wake up. Tears stung the backs of her eyes as she gazed at her daughter\u2019s battered face, at the casts on her legs and arm, at the bandages that covered numerous wounds, at the tubes and wires that hooked her to beeping machines.</p><p>As she brushed a lock of hair from Megan\u2019s brow, Evelyn murmured a silent prayer, asking, begging, for a miracle.</p><p>She looked up, startled, as a tall man with dark blond hair and impenetrable dark brown eyes appeared in the doorway. Something about him made her take several steps forward, putting herself between the stranger and her daughter\u2019s bed. \u201cMay I help you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Rhys paused in the doorway when he realized Megan wasn\u2019t alone. He had been so intent on getting to her, he hadn\u2019t bothered to scan the room for anyone else. There was no doubt that the stranger was Megan\u2019s mother. She was a pretty woman with reddish-brown hair and blue eyes. The man was tall with brown hair just going gray at the temples. His eyes were the same shade of brown as Megan\u2019s.</p><p>Rhys inclined his head slightly in the woman\u2019s direction. A quick search of her mind told him her name was Evelyn. The tearful man standing across from her was Megan\u2019s father, George.</p><p>Rhys stepped farther into the room. \u201cI\u2019ve come to see Megan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you a friend of hers?\u201d Evelyn asked.</p><p>\u201cYou could say that.\u201d</p><p>George DeLacey wiped his eyes, his narrow gaze assessing as he looked Rhys up and down. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRhys Costain.\u201d</p><p>George shook his head. \u201cShe never mentioned you.\u201d</p><p>Rhys looked past Megan\u2019s parents to where she lay, a slim, pale-faced figure swathed in bandages. He had followed the scent of her blood to this place. Try as he might, he had been unable to link with her mind. The thought that she might never regain consciousness frightened him in ways nothing else ever had.</p><p>He took a deep breath. \u201cI just want to see her,\u201d he said quietly. Nothing they said or did would stop him, but he would try to get their permission first. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Evelyn and George exchanged glances, then George nodded almost imperceptibly.</p><p>\u201cAlone,\u201d Rhys said.</p><p>George shook his head. \u201cNo way.\u201d</p> <p>Swallowing his irritation, Rhys moved toward the bed. \u201cWhat do the doctors say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing very hopeful,\u201d George replied, his voice thick. \u201cEven if she wakes up, she won\u2019t walk again.\u201d</p><p>Rhys took one of Megan\u2019s hands in his. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was out shopping for a wedding dress. A drunk driver hit her when she was crossing the street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn jail.\u201d</p><p>Rhys nodded. If Megan died, all the cops in the world wouldn\u2019t be able to protect the kid who had done this to her.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know our daughter?\u201d Evelyn asked.</p><p>\u201cWe met at Shore\u2019s. We\u2019ve been dating for several months.\u201d Rhys swallowed hard. \u201cI asked her to marry me, and she said yes.\u201d</p><p>George and Evelyn exchanged glances again. George looked incredulous.</p><p>\u201cShe never told us,\u201d Evelyn murmured. She looked at her husband. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t she tell us?\u201d she asked, and burst into tears.</p> <p>George put his arm around his wife\u2019s shoulders and guided her, gently, toward a chair. When she was seated, he knelt beside her.</p><p>Rhys moved swiftly to Megan\u2019s side. Taking her hand in his, he tried once again to join his mind with hers. It hadn\u2019t worked from a distance; he prayed it would work now. Megan? He squeezed her hand, silently willing her to respond. Megan, can you hear me?</p><p>\u201cDammit, Megan,\u201d he whispered urgently. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to hear me!\u201d</p><p>But silence was his only answer.</p><p>Rhys wandered the dark streets, heedless of where his feet carried him. Nothing mattered now but Megan. Four days had passed since the accident, and she was still lost to him, locked in a coma. He had gone to see her every night. Her parents no longer questioned his right to be there. Not wanting Megan to be left alone, her mother and father were taking turns staying at her bedside. Evelyn stayed during the day, George at night. Rhys arrived at the hospital late at night, after exhaustion and worry had taken their toll and her father finally succumbed to sleep.</p><p>And now Rhys again stood at her bedside. Unmindful of her father, asleep in a chair, Rhys held Megan\u2019s hand, speaking softly of his love for her, of the life they would have together if she would only awaken. Even though he wasn\u2019t sure she heard him, he went on, reminiscing about the nights they had spent together, the times they had made love.</p><p>\u201cMegan, my sweet.\u201d His fingertips brushed her cheek, traced the curve of her lips. Her face was as pale as the pillowcase beneath her head, her skin as cool as his, her breathing shallow. How much longer would she lie there, unmoving and unaware, before he lost her for good?</p><p>His gaze moved to her throat, to the pulse slowly beating there. If he brought her across, would it restore her to good health?</p> <p>Or condemn her to spending an eternity in the horrible state she was now in?</p><p>And how was he to know?</p><p>Three long weeks passed. Fear and concern for Megan drew Rhys and her parents together. Rhys found himself genuinely liking George and Evelyn. They were good, honest people, openly expressing their gratitude to the doctors and nurses caring for their daughter. Rhys knew they were naturally curious about the man who claimed to be engaged to Megan, but their questions were tactful, and they didn\u2019t pursue subjects he was reluctant to discuss.</p><p>He knew they wondered why he always arrived after dark, even on the weekends, why he never went for coffee with George or accepted any of the donuts or homemade treats Evelyn sometimes brought to the hospital to share with the staff. He considered telling them what he was but, in the end, years of discretion kept him silent. It was one thing for Megan\u2019s parents to think of him as somewhat mysterious, another entirely for them to know the truth.</p><p>George and Evelyn spent hours talking to Megan or reading to her. A radio played constantly in the background in the belief that it might stimulate a response.</p><p>Rhys continued to speak to her as well, sometimes vocally, sometimes mentally, but there was no response. She didn\u2019t speak, didn\u2019t open her eyes, didn\u2019t move. Some of the bandages had been removed, revealing ugly bruises on one side of her face and along her right arm.</p><p>Earlier that night, the doctor had called Megan\u2019s parents into his office. Curious to hear what the physician had to say, Rhys had dissolved into mist and followed them. The news hadn\u2019t been good. As gently as possible, the doctor had explained that, with every passing day, it became more unlikely that Megan would regain consciousness. He also advised them that there was a possibility she would regain consciousness but be in a vegetative state, meaning she would have lost all cognitive neurological function. She could be awake and appear normal, but if the cognitive part of her brain ceased to function, she would be unable to respond to her surroundings.</p><p>Distraught, Evelyn had sobbed, \u201cIt would be better if she died! She wouldn\u2019t want to live like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always a chance she\u2019ll wake and regain all her faculties,\u201d the doctor said. \u201cBut I thought you should be prepared for the worst as well.\u201d</p><p>With a nod, George led Evelyn out of the doctor\u2019s office.</p><p>Rhys had been back at Megan\u2019s bedside when they entered her room.</p><p>He was there now, his hand lightly stroking her brow. It was almost two in the morning, and the hospital was quiet save for the soft shushing of rubber-soled shoes as the night nurses checked on their patients, and the ever-present wheezing and beeping of life-support machines. Megan\u2019s father slept in one of the chairs, his brow furrowed with worry even in sleep.</p><p>As he had every night, Rhys tried to connect with Megan\u2019s mind. Tonight, fear and a sense of doom caused by the doctor\u2019s gloomy prognosis drove him to persist longer than usual. Intent on the task at hand, he did not notice as the minutes and hours passed, until he felt the warning tingle that signaled the rising of the sun.</p><p>He was about to kiss her good-bye when her voice sounded in his mind.</p><p>Rhys?</p><p>Megan! Hope flared in his heart and soul. Megan, can you hear me?</p><p>Where am I? Where are you? It\u2019s dark, so dark.</p><p>Heat from the rising sun prickled along his skin. Moving quietly, he went to the window and closed the blinds. Open your eyes for me, Megan.</p><p>I can\u2019t. What\u2019s wrong with me? Am I dying?</p><p>No, love, you\u2019re in a coma.</p><p>Then how can we be talking?</p><p>I don\u2019t know. I want to try something.</p><p>What?</p><p>I\u2019m going to give you some of my blood.</p><p>He smiled faintly as he sensed her revulsion. It might help heal you.</p><p>Afraid she would object, he didn\u2019t wait for a reply. He bit into his wrist, and, after gently parting her lips, he held his arm over her mouth and let a few drops of his blood trickle onto the back of her tongue, hoping they would slide down her throat.</p><p>He would have given her more, but a nurse chose that moment to pause outside the door.</p><p>Turning his back to the nurse, Rhys closed the wound in his wrist, bid the nurse good night, and left the room.</p><p>Outside, he took a quick moment to admire the sunrise before willing himself to his penthouse.</p><p>He was back at the hospital at sundown the following night. Earlier that day, he had touched Megan\u2019s mind. Even though she hadn\u2019t answered, he had assured her that he loved her, missed her, would see her soon. He was whistling softly when he arrived at the hospital, unable to contain the hope that his blood had worked a miracle, that he would walk into Megan\u2019s room and find her sitting up in bed, smiling and happy.</p><p>But such was not to be. Even though she was now breathing on her own, Megan lay as before, pale and unmoving. George and Evelyn stood together at her bedside. The weeks had taken their toll on Megan\u2019s parents. Her father\u2019s hair had turned completely gray; deep lines of worry bracketed his mouth. Her mother, too, had aged in the last month. Evelyn never smiled now; the dark shadows under her eyes were evidence of sleepless nights and anxious days.</p><p>Two to four weeks, the doctor had said. If Megan didn\u2019t come out of the coma in that time, the odds were she would lapse into a vegetative state and never recover.</p><p>Taking her uninjured hand in his, Rhys bent down, his lips brushing her cheek, her eyelids, the pulse beating in the hollow of her throat.</p><p>\u201cFear not, my love,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI won\u2019t let that happen to you.\u201d She didn\u2019t respond, of course, and because he wanted her to know he was there, he reached for the link between them; he found only emptiness.</p><p>In that moment, he made up his mind. No more waiting. No more hoping and praying for a miracle that might never come. Tonight, he would bring her across. But not here. If it worked, she would wake with a ravenous thirst. It wasn\u2019t something doctors or nurses were equipped to handle, nor was it something he wanted her parents to see.</p><p>He glanced at George and Evelyn. It would be cruel to take Megan away without warning them beforehand. They had suffered enough.</p><p>His decision made, he closed the door to Megan\u2019s room. \u201cGeorge, Evelyn, why don\u2019t you sit down? I have something to tell you.\u201d</p><p>They exchanged glances, then sat side by side, holding hands. Evelyn\u2019s cheeks were damp with tears. George looked mildly curious.</p><p>Rhys dragged his fingers through his hair. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how to say this except to say it straight out. I\u2019m a vampire.\u201d</p><p>Evelyn blinked at him.</p><p>\u201cThis is no time for jokes,\u201d George said angrily. \u201cMy daughter is dying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look like I\u2019m joking?\u201d</p><p>Clenching his fists, George started to rise. There was no doubt in Rhys\u2019s mind that the man was looking for any excuse to hit something. He had been through hell in the last month, and, up to now, he had managed to hold it all together.</p><p>Drawing on his preternatural power, Rhys forced the man back into his chair.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell!\u201d George exclaimed. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, I\u2019m a vampire. Do you need more proof?\u201d And so saying, Rhys bared his fangs and unleashed the monster within him. He knew what they saw. He had seen enough of the Undead to know that his face took on a hardness no human\u2019s ever wore, that his eyes were blood red. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Evelyn opened her mouth to scream, but no sound emerged.</p><p>George stared at him. \u201cWhy are you telling us this? Are you going to...\u201d His face paled.</p><p>With a shake of his head, Rhys retracted his fangs and willed the beast back inside. \u201cI\u2019m telling you because I\u2019m going to take Megan to my place. I\u2019m going to bring her across. I think it\u2019s the only way to save her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou want to turn my daughter into a vampire?\u201d George shook his head emphatically. \u201cI won\u2019t hear of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeorge, let him do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you out of your mind, woman?\u201d George exclaimed. \u201cHe wants to make her into a monster!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to lose Megan.\u201d Evelyn turned pleading eyes on Rhys. \u201cDo it. If it will bring Megan back to us, do it.\u201d</p><p>George brought his fist down on the arm of the chair. \u201cDammit, Evie, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying!\u201d</p> <p>But Evelyn wasn\u2019t listening to her husband. Her gaze was focused on Rhys. \u201cPlease,\u201d she said, \u201csave her for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best, but there are no guarantees.\u201d</p><p>Evelyn bit down on her lower lip, obviously disturbed by the implication that something might go wrong. And then she squared her shoulders. \u201cYou\u2019re our only hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMegan wouldn\u2019t want this,\u201d George said. \u201cAnd if she knew what you were, she wouldn\u2019t want you, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knows.\u201d</p><p>George stared at him, all the fight gone out of him.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m taking her out of here tonight,\u201d Rhys said quietly. \u201cI want you to go talk to her doctor and tell them you\u2019ve decided to take her home to die. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll try to talk you out of it. Just stand firm. Sign whatever papers you have to.\u201d</p><p>George nodded, though it was clear from the look on his face that he was against it.</p><p>\u201cWhen that\u2019s done, I think the two of you should go home. There\u2019s nothing else you can do here.\u201d</p><p>Evelyn clutched her husband\u2019s arm, her expression growing even more anxious. \u201cBut you\u2019ll bring her to us, after? You swear it?\u201d</p><p>Rhys nodded. \u201cWhen she\u2019s ready to see you, I\u2019ll bring her home. You have my word on it.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 48</p><p>After the necessary papers were signed, Megan was wheeled out to the curb to a waiting ambulance. Once the nurse who had accompanied Megan returned to the hospital, George dismissed the ambulance. Evelyn sobbed quietly as she kissed Megan\u2019s cheek.</p><p>Rhys lifted Megan from the gurney. \u201cWe need to go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRemember your promise,\u201d Evelyn said. Sobbing now, she kissed Megan\u2019s cheek.</p><p>George stared at Rhys. \u201cI don\u2019t care who you are. I don\u2019t care what you are.\u201d His voice broke.\u201d If anything happens to my daughter...\u201d</p><p>Rhys nodded. \u201cI hear you.\u201d</p><p>Since George and Evelyn knew what he was, there was no need for subterfuge. Rhys removed the casts from Megan\u2019s legs, then willed the two of them to his penthouse.</p><p>Doubts plagued him as soon as he laid her on his bed. What if it didn\u2019t work? What if he took too much and killed her? What if his blood brought her out of the coma but left her body unable to move, her mind unable to function?</p><p>Sitting on the edge of the bed, he ran his knuckles along her check. She was cold. Cold and unresponsive.</p><p>Guilt burned through him. No matter how you sliced it, this was all his fault. If he had stayed out of her life, she wouldn\u2019t have been looking for a wedding dress on that fateful day, wouldn\u2019t have been crossing the street at just that moment. Wouldn\u2019t be lying here, more dead than alive.</p><p>His fingertips slid down the side of her neck to rest in the hollow of her throat. He could feel the faint beat of her heart, hear the sluggish flow of blood wending its way through her veins, the labored sound of her breathing.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re gonna do it,\u201d he muttered, \u201cyou\u2019d damn well better do it before it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>Murmuring, \u201cForgive me for breaking my promise, my love, but I can\u2019t let you go,\u201d he drew her into his lap and brushed the hair away from her neck.</p><p>He didn\u2019t realize he was crying until the red of his tears dripped onto her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cForgive me,\u201d he said again, and lowered his head to her throat.</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond when his fangs pierced her skin.</p><p>He drank, and her blood was warm and sweet and more satisfying than anything he had ever known.</p><p>He drank until the spark of life within her guttered and then, biting into his own wrist, he held it over her mouth, lightly stroking her throat in an effort to make her swallow.</p><p>\u201cDrink, my love,\u201d he pleaded. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to drink.\u201d</p><p>Nothing. No movement, no fluttering of her eyelids, no change in her breathing or heartbeat.</p><p>\u201cMegan!\u201d</p><p>His blood dripped into her mouth, slid down her throat.</p><p>Slowly, so slowly that at first he thought he was imagining it, her skin grew warmer, color returned to her cheeks, her heartbeat grew stronger, steadier.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it! Come on, darlin\u2019, fight!\u201d</p><p>When she swallowed, he placed his wrist closer to her mouth. Relief poured through him when her hand came up, grasping his wrist to hold his arm closer.</p><p>\u201cMegan.\u201d Murmuring her name, he caressed her cheek with his free hand. \u201cDrink, Megan. Take as much as you want,\u201d he said fervently. \u201cAs much as you need.\u201d</p><p>Megan reached upward. It was like rising from the bottom of a deep, dark pit with nothing to guide her. She had no recollection of how she had fallen, no explanation for the pain that engulfed her, no memory of anything but a shadowy figure with blazing red eyes....</p><p>\u201cRhys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>She tried to open her eyes, tried to follow the sound of his voice, but the smothering darkness dragged her down again.</p><p>\u201cFight, Megan! Come on, love. Come to me.\u201d</p><p>His voice rang in her mind. Rhys. If she could find him, if she could just touch him, everything would be all right.</p><p>She struggled through the thick blackness, clawing her way toward his voice, and slowly, ever so slowly, the inky blackness faded to a dark gray that gradually grew lighter even as her body felt lighter, almost weightless.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s it. Come to me, Megan, my love. I\u2019m here, waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRhys!\u201d She fought her way toward him until, with a final burst of energy, she opened her eyes. \u201cRhys!\u201d she cried. \u201cOh, Rhys, I had the worst nightmare! I tried and tried to wake up, and I couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Gathering her into his arms, he murmured, \u201cI know, love.\u201d He rained featherlight kisses on her cheeks, her chin, the tip of her nose.</p><p>\u201cWhy is my arm in a cast? What are all these bandages? Why am I wearing a hospital gown?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you remember what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I...\u201d She stared at him as if seeing him for the first time, then frowned. \u201cYou look different somehow.\u201d Turning her head slowly, she scanned the room. \u201cEverything looks different.\u201d She wrinkled her nose. \u201cSmells different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMegan\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happened to me? Why is everything so strange? Why do I feel so funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne thing at a time, love. You were hit by a car. You\u2019ve been in a coma for almost a month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA coma!\u201d She stared at him, disbelief in her eyes, and then shook her head in denial. \u201cNo, it was just a bad dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how do you explain the cast and the bandages?\u201d</p><p>Confusion flickered in the depths of her eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, you\u2019ve been in a coma. The doctors weren\u2019t hopeful that you\u2019d recover. They said there was a good chance you\u2019d be in a vegetative state for the rest of your life, and if you recovered, you\u2019d never walk again.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. \u201cIf I was as bad off as all that, why aren\u2019t I still in the hospital?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMegan, wiggle your toes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy parents must be worried to death. Good Lord, what must they think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey know everything. I spent the last few weeks at the hospital with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>Rhys nodded. \u201cWhen we realized you weren\u2019t going to recover, I told them what I was\u2014\u201d</p><p>Megan\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told them I was going to take you out of the hospital and bring you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they agreed?\u201d she asked skeptically.</p><p>\u201cMegan, wiggle your toes.\u201d</p><p>With an exasperated sigh, she stretched her legs out and wiggled her toes. \u201cHappy now?\u201d</p><p>Uttering a wordless cry, he cradled her to his chest, a silent prayer of thanks rising in his heart.</p><p>It took him a moment to realize she had gone rigid in his embrace.</p><p>\u201cYou turned me, didn\u2019t you?\u201d she asked, her voice brittle as memories of Shirl and how her friend had changed after being turned jumped to the forefront of her mind. \u201cThat\u2019s why I feel so funny, isn\u2019t it! How could you do such a thing without asking me?\u201d She pushed off his lap, then stood staring down at him. \u201cHow could you?\u201d she repeated, her voice sharp with accusation and anger. \u201cYou promised...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you rather be back in the hospital, unconscious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not, but...\u201d She glanced around the room, only then realizing she could see everything clearly even though the lights were off. She could smell the oil and gasoline from a passing truck, the scent of garbage from somewhere down the street, the hint of rain in the air.</p><p>Maybe she wasn\u2019t a vampire. There were all kinds of stories about people waking from comas with abilities they hadn\u2019t had before.</p><p>Turning on her heel, she walked out onto the balcony. She couldn\u2019t be a vampire, didn\u2019t want to believe it was true. But why would Rhys lie?</p><p>\u201cVampire.\u201d She grimaced as she murmured the word. Was that why she felt so strange, so unsettled? So empty inside? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re hungry,\u201d Rhys said, coming up behind her. \u201cYou need to feed.\u201d</p><p>Feed? Visions of a cheeseburger and a chocolate malt rose in her mind, and with it the knowledge that she would never again enjoy any of her favorite foods. She was a vampire now. No more onion rings. No more spaghetti and meatballs. No more hot, fresh bread from the bakery. No more lemon meringue pie. And even as the thought crossed her mind, she realized she had no desire for any of the foods she had once loved.</p><p>Vampire. She repeated the word in her mind. Vampire. Vampire.</p> <p>She was hungry, and she was a vampire.</p><p>Hungry vampires didn\u2019t eat hamburgers and French fries.</p><p>They drank blood.</p><p>\u201cMegan?\u201d</p><p>She turned, ever so slowly, to face him. \u201cI\u2019m a vampire.\u201d</p> <p>He nodded. \u201cHate me if you like. Destroy me if it will make you happy. But I can\u2019t be sorry for what I\u2019ve done.\u201d He smiled faintly. \u201cI couldn\u2019t bear to think of the world without you in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said my parents know everything. Does that mean they knew what you were planning to do?\u201d</p><p>He nodded again.</p><p>\u201cAnd they didn\u2019t care?\u201d she exclaimed incredulously.</p><p>\u201cThey believed it was the only way to save you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never see them again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course you will. I promised to take you home when you were ready, but there are a few things you need to learn first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike how to...to hunt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t think I want to learn. I don\u2019t think I want to be a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid there\u2019s no going back.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, trying to determine how she felt. She should be angry or sad or curious or something. But she didn\u2019t feel anything. Only a strange kind of numbness. Maybe it wasn\u2019t surprising, since she was no longer human. \u201cI don\u2019t want this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but why don\u2019t you give it a try before you make up your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like buying a new dress,\u201d she said bitterly. \u201cI can\u2019t take it back if it doesn\u2019t fit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBeing a vampire isn\u2019t all bad. I know you\u2019re worried about the blood part. You\u2019re probably thinking it\u2019ll be repulsive and you won\u2019t be able to do it. But trust me, it won\u2019t be as bad as you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it that easy for you to accept being a vampire? One day you were human, and the next you weren\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. I wasn\u2019t particularly happy with it at first, but I knew it couldn\u2019t be undone and so I decided to make the best of it. And I\u2019ve never been sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never wanted to be human again? Not once in five hundred years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d It wasn\u2019t entirely true. Not long ago, he had thought he would gladly give up being a vampire to spend one mortal lifetime with this woman. But now that she was nosferatu, they could have many lifetimes together, if she would accept what had happened and move on. He held out his hand. \u201cCome hunting with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if being a vampire brings out the worst in me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know? I don\u2019t want to be like Shirl!\u201d Her eyes grew wide as a new thought occurred to her. \u201cShe was like Villagrande\u2019s slave. He told her to kill you, and she would have done it. She would have killed me if he\u2019d told her to. It was like he was her master and she didn\u2019t have any will of her own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a strong vampire,\u201d Rhys said quietly. \u201cAnd she was new. It was easy for him to influence her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a strong vampire,\u201d Megan retorted. \u201cAnd I\u2019m new.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. The difference is, I love and respect you. I\u2019m not looking for a sex slave or a sycophant. I just want to make this as easy for you as I can.\u201d Once she had accepted being a vampire, he would take her to meet what was left of the Council so they would know she was under his protection. He had contacted them soon after Villagrande had been destroyed and informed Rupert, Nicholas, and Julius that he was staying on the West Coast. Odd, that the three who had been with him the longest had survived the latest conflict.</p><p>\u201cSo, what do you say?\u201d he asked. \u201cAre you ready to go out and face the world?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but let\u2019s get it over with.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t admit it to Rhys, but she couldn\u2019t deny that she was curious. Of course, Rhys being Rhys, he was probably reading her mind even now.</p><p>If she decided to stay with him, she was going to have to practice blocking him or she would never have any privacy, she thought irritably, and then frowned.</p><p>If she stayed with him.</p><p>That was the sixty-four-thousand-dollar question, wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>After removing the cast from Megan\u2019s arm and the last of the bandages, they made a quick trip to Megan\u2019s house. There, she changed into something a little more appropriate than an open-in-the-back hospital gown, and then Rhys took her hunting down by the beach.</p><p>Megan felt surprisingly calm as they strolled along the boardwalk, perhaps because none of it seemed real. This had to be a continuation of her nightmare, some sort of extended fever dream, and she would soon wake up in her own room, in her own bed.</p><p>She followed Rhys into a small tavern, stood near the entrance as he studied the men and women inside. When he asked her which patron she fancied, she pointed at a young man with black hair and dark blue eyes. Moments later, Rhys left the tavern, and the young man followed him down the street into the shadows. Megan trailed behind them. Rhys hadn\u2019t spoken to the man or signaled to him in any way that she had seen; nevertheless, the man followed at his heels like a well-trained puppy. When Rhys came to a stop, the young man stopped, too.</p><p>Rhys looked at her over the man\u2019s head; then, slowly and deliberately, he bit the man\u2019s neck.</p><p>The coppery scent of fresh blood wafted through the air, warm and fragrant. The smell teased Megan\u2019s nostrils, bringing the world around her into sharp focus, and her hunger with it. The numbness that had gripped her, the odd sense of unreality, all faded away, and she wanted nothing more than to take the young man in her arms.</p><p>She looked askance at Rhys, who nodded once.</p><p>And Megan took the dark-haired man into her embrace, lowered her head to his neck, and drank his life\u2019s blood as if she had been doing it for years.</p><p>\u201cWill I be able to be awake during the day, the way you are?\u201d Megan asked.</p><p>\u201cNot at first,\u201d Rhys replied, \u201cbut soon.\u201d He had been surprised at how quickly and efficiently she had fed the first time. Now, walking back to his penthouse, he wondered at the wisdom of bringing her across. The thought of losing her had been more than he could bear, but now, with his head clearer, he couldn\u2019t help thinking about Shirl. He hadn\u2019t made many mistakes in his life as a vampire, but turning Shirl was right up there in the top two.</p><p>They walked in silence for several moments before Megan declared, \u201cI\u2019m going back to my place.\u201d</p><p>A number of responses chased themselves across his mind, and then he shrugged. \u201cIf that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to try to talk me out of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m through making decisions for you.\u201d</p><p>Megan blinked at him, not at all sure she liked this new side of him. At best, she had expected an argument; at worst, she had thought he would tell her outright that she was staying with him, like it or not.</p><p>\u201cA few things you need to remember,\u201d he said, his voice cool. \u201cYou need to be inside before the sun comes up. Your preternatural instincts will tell you when you\u2019re in danger. You\u2019ll need to feed every night for the first year or so. If you kill anyone\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to do that!\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIt happens sometimes, especially with the newly turned. They can\u2019t always control their hunger. So, like I was saying, if you kill anyone in my territory, be sure to dispose of the body.\u201d</p><p>His territory. How had she forgotten that Rhys was the Master of the City? Among the West Coast vampires, his word was law.</p><p>\u201cYou need to meet the members of the Vampire Council,\u201d Rhys said. \u201cI\u2019ll arrange it for tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>When he came to a stop, she realized they were in front of her house. She had been so stunned by what he was saying, she hadn\u2019t paid any attention to where they were. In a distant part of her mind, she was amazed that they had covered so much ground in such a short time, and that, in spite of the long walk, she wasn\u2019t the least bit tired.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve rented a house near the beach,\u201d he said, and rattled off the address. \u201cBe there tomorrow around midnight.\u201d</p><p>Megan crossed her arms, her chin jutting out defiantly. \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t want to meet the Council?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe there, or I\u2019ll come and get you.\u201d</p><p>Forcing as much sarcasm as she could into her voice, she muttered, \u201cYes, Master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd don\u2019t you forget it.\u201d</p><p>With a huff, she turned on her heel and walked up the driveway.</p><p>Rhys stifled the urge to call her back. She had every right to be angry with him. Dammit! He could compel her to return, force her to stay with him, but that wasn\u2019t what he wanted. He loved her, and although she might not want to admit it now, she loved him.</p><p>Whether they spent their future together or not was up to her.</p><p>Chapter 49</p><p>Aware of Rhys\u2019s gaze on her back, Megan went up the stairs and into the house, then slammed the door behind her. She knew it was childish, but she felt better for it. Then, unable to help herself, she hurried to the front window and peered out at the sidewalk. There was no one there. She couldn\u2019t help feeling hurt that he had let her go so easily. Oh, she knew she had made him angry, but what had he expected? One day she was trying on wedding dresses and the next thing she knew, she was a vampire.</p><p>Vampire.</p><p>Undead.</p><p>Creature of the night. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She licked her lips, remembering how enjoyable it had been to feed off the dark-haired man, amazed by how natural it had seemed, how good he had tasted. She should have been repulsed by what she had done; instead, she was eager to go out and do it again. What if she went to visit her parents and all she wanted to do was snack on them? What would they think when they saw her, when they knew what she was? Would they be horrified? Or overcome with guilt for agreeing to let Rhys turn her into a monster?</p><p>But she didn\u2019t feel like a monster. She felt the same as always, only better.</p><p>What was she going to do about Rhys? He had asked her to marry him, but she had been mortal at the time. Was his proposal still valid now that she was dead?</p><p>Not dead. Undead.</p> <p>She blew out an impatient sigh. Whatever she was, she felt more vital and alive than ever before. Stronger mentally and physically. More sure of herself.</p><p>She lifted a hand to her face. Did she look the same? Shirl had looked the same, and yet not. Her hair had been more lustrous, her eyes more intense, her skin almost luminous. None of the changes had been blatant, but they had been there.</p><p>Just her luck, Megan thought ruefully. She probably looked better than she ever had but, being a vampire, she would never be able to see for herself.</p><p>Filled with a sudden nervous energy, she dived into a frenzy of housework, vacuuming the rugs, changing the sheets on her bed. Moving into the kitchen, she stared at the refrigerator for a moment and then, taking a deep breath, she opened the door.</p><p>Megan had expected to find a gallon of sour milk and a crisper filled with spoiled produce; instead, the refrigerator was empty. That was odd, she thought, then realized that while she had been in a coma, her parents had probably stayed here. Her mother must have cleaned out the fridge and watered the plants.</p> <p>Murmuring, \u201cOh, Mom,\u201d she sat on one of the kitchen chairs and burst into tears. How was she ever going to face her parents? How could she ever trust herself to be with them? What if she went to see them and they were repulsed by what she was, or, worse, afraid of her? But they hadn\u2019t been afraid of Rhys, not if what he said was true.</p><p>Her sobs came harder, faster. She cried for her lost humanity, for the children she would never have, the suntan she wouldn\u2019t get next summer, all the chocolates she would never eat.</p><p>She grabbed a towel and wiped her face, stared at the faint streaks of red on the towel, then, with her finger, she wiped a tear from her eye. It was red. But of course it was. She was a vampire now. Fighting a rush of hysteria, she went to the sink and splashed cold water on her face. So, she was a vampire. Time to stop feeling sorry for herself and look on the bright side. She would never get sick. She would never have to worry about getting old and wrinkled and helpless. But even that had its drawbacks. All the people she knew would age and die\u2014her parents, Mr. Parker, Drexel, all of her other clients. Sooner or later, they would all be gone.</p><p>All but Rhys...</p><p>He loved her.</p><p>She loved him.</p> <p>He was a vampire.</p><p>She was a vampire.</p><p>There was no reason for them to be apart now. Whatever danger she might have faced as his mortal companion no longer existed.</p><p>She sat there, thinking about her future, until a rather unpleasant tingle skittered down her spine. She knew instinctively that it was almost dawn.</p><p>She checked all the doors and windows to make sure they were locked, closed the curtains in her bedroom, then changed into her nightgown and climbed into bed, her heart pounding.</p><p>Lying on her back, she stared up at the ceiling. What would it be like when she was compelled to sleep during the day? Was it like death? A cold knot of fear formed in the pit of her stomach. What if she didn\u2019t wake up again?</p><p>Megan, close your eyes and relax.</p><p>The sound of Rhys\u2019s voice calmed her immediately. His thoughtfulness made her love him all the more. In spite of everything, he hadn\u2019t left her to face her first day as a vampire alone.</p> <p>Megan came awake as the sun went down. For a moment, she lingered under the covers. The Dark Sleep really was like death, she thought. Judging from the unrumpled blankets on her bed, she hadn\u2019t moved at all once she closed her eyes. Nor had she dreamed.</p><p>Throwing the covers aside, she went into the bathroom to shower. Emerging some fifteen minutes later, she pulled on her bathrobe, then sat on the edge of the bed. What did vampires do to pass the time?</p><p>Feeling at loose ends, she found her cell phone, took a deep breath, and called her parents. As soon as she heard her mother\u2019s voice, she knew everything would be all right. Vampire or not, her parents loved her. Nothing would change that. She talked to her mom and then her dad, and then her mom again. After assuring her mother that she was fine and promising to see them soon, Megan ended the call, had another good cry, and went out to try hunting solo.</p><p>At eleven thirty, Megan stood in front of her closet, her foot tapping impatiently as she went through her clothes. Nothing suited her mood. And then, on impulse, she reached into the back and pulled out a dress she had bought on a whim but never worn. Removing the plastic, she held it up. It was perfect. A pair of three-inch black heels and her grandmother\u2019s antique pearl necklace completed the outfit.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t go wrong with basic black and pearls,\u201d she muttered, and left the house.</p><p>She arrived at the address Rhys had given her ten minutes late, on purpose. It was a small act of defiance, but it made her feel better.</p><p>The house was small, the wood siding weathered and gray. A white picket fence surrounded the yard. Lights glowed from behind the curtains in the front window. The scent of sea and sand was strong, accented by the sound of waves endlessly rushing to the shore.</p><p>An inhaled breath told her Rhys was inside the house, and that he wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>Gathering her courage, she stepped through the gate and walked along the crushed shell path to the front door.</p><p>It opened before she knocked, and Rhys stood there, his dark blond hair gleaming in the lamplight.</p><p>Taking a step back, he said, \u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>She followed him into the living room. Two black leather sofas faced each other in the middle of the room. There was no other furniture. A tall man with wispy gray hair and blue eyes stood next to the fireplace. A man who appeared to be in his twenties slouched on one of the sofas, regarding her through slitted brown eyes. A red-and-black snake tattoo adorned his left arm. A third man, with black, slicked-back hair and a thin mustache, reminded her of an old-time matinee idol. He sat on the other sofa, his ankles crossed, a faint smile on his handsome face.</p><p>Rhys gestured at the gray-haired man. \u201cMegan, this is Nicholas. The man who looks like Valentino is Rupert...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m Julius.\u201d The tattooed man eyed her as if she was a bowl of cream and he was a hungry cat.</p><p>Rhys glared at Julius before returning his attention to Megan. \u201cI\u2019ve told them that you\u2019re mine and as such, you\u2019re under my protection, and by my law, theirs as well.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, unsure of what to say, then murmured, \u201cPleased to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dear, the pleasure is all mine,\u201d Nicholas said. Coming forward, he bowed over her hand.</p><p>Rupert and Julius exchanged glances; then, as if pulled by the same string, they rose and offered her their hands.</p><p>\u201cNice to have a pretty woman on the Council,\u201d Julius remarked with a smile just short of a leer.</p><p>\u201cYes, indeed,\u201d Rupert agreed.</p><p>Megan looked at Rhys askance. He hadn\u2019t said anything about her being a member of the Council. Good grief, she had only been a vampire for one day.</p><p>Rhys shrugged, then turned his attention to the others. \u201cThat\u2019s all. I just wanted you to meet Megan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure,\u201d Nicholas said, and vanished.</p><p>\u201cCiao, baby,\u201d Julius murmured, and he, too, disappeared from sight.</p><p>\u201cIt was nice to meet you, Megan, my dear,\u201d Rupert said. \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll meet again soon.\u201d</p><p>Megan nodded, but before she could think of anything to say, Rupert was out the door, leaving her alone with Rhys. Suddenly nervous, she rubbed her hands up and down her arms. Why had she worn this come-and-get-me dress? Tight and black, it outlined her every curve.</p><p>\u201cYou look lovely,\u201d Rhys said quietly.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cI\u2019m...I...\u201d She looked up at him. He had always known what she was thinking, why wasn\u2019t he reading her mind now?</p><p>\u201cThe meeting is over,\u201d he said formally. \u201cThank you for coming.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, mute. If she didn\u2019t say something, do something, she had the feeling she might never see him again.</p><p>She cleared her throat. Squared her shoulders. And blurted, \u201cYou promised to marry me not long ago, Mr. Costain. Do you intend to renege on that promise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMegan...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d She spoke quickly, before her courage could desert her. \u201cAnd I know you love me.\u201d</p><p>He regarded her silently, one brow raised, for several moments.</p><p>Megan resisted the urge to wring her hands as she waited for him to say something, anything, to break the tension between them.</p><p>And then the corner of his mouth twitched. \u201cReading my mind, are you, Miss DeLacey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe turnabout is fair play, Mr. Costain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed? What am I thinking now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing I would dare repeat,\u201d she replied with mock horror.</p><p>Laughing, he pulled her body against his and kissed her, long and hard. \u201cIf you think that\u2019s bad, just wait until I get you home.\u201d</p><p>Home, she thought, as he swept her into his embrace and kissed her again. Home wasn\u2019t a house with a roof and four walls; it was here and now, in the arms of the man she loved.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Megan glanced over her shoulder. \u201cHow do I look?\u201d</p><p>Evelyn DeLacey blinked back a tear as her daughter pirouetted in front of her. \u201cBeautiful,\u201d she murmured. \u201cLike a fairy-tale princess.\u201d The dress looked as if it had been made for her, simple yet elegant with its fitted sleeves and square neckline edged with delicate lace. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful!\u201d Megan exclaimed, and then, seeing the tears in her mother\u2019s eyes, she whispered, \u201cMom, please don\u2019t cry. I\u2019m happy, truly I am.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Evelyn forced a smile as she blinked back her tears. Her daughter, her only child, was a vampire, and in a few minutes, she would be married to a vampire. But, vampire or not, Megan was here, as loving and happy as always, and for that Evelyn would be forever indebted to her future son-in-law. And even though it certainly wasn\u2019t the kind of life she would have wished for Megan, Evelyn couldn\u2019t deny the proof of her own eyes. Megan had never looked happier. And Rhys adored her, anyone could see that.</p><p>There was a knock on the door, and then George peeked inside. \u201cEverybody ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, dear,\u201d Evelyn said. She hugged Megan, then left the room to take a seat in the living room with the others.</p> <p>\u201cSo,\u201d George said, his voice gruff with emotion, \u201cthis is it, the big day.\u201d</p><p>Megan nodded, suddenly too choked up to speak as she recalled a night a year or so ago when she and Shirl had talked about weddings and promised to stand up for each other when the time came.</p><p>George cleared his throat. \u201cYou look beautiful, princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Daddy, so do you.\u201d Standing on tiptoe, Megan kissed her father\u2019s cheek. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>George blinked back a tear as he placed her hand on his arm. \u201cOkay, sweet pea, here we go. I hope that man of yours knows how lucky he is.\u201d</p> <p>Megan\u2019s heart fluttered with excitement as they walked down the short hallway that led into her parents\u2019 living room. They had decided on a small wedding, just the immediate family and a few close friends. She winked at Daisy and Erik, who were sitting beside Alex and Paula, nodded at Mr. and Mrs. Parker, smiled at Drexel, who made a sad face in return. And then she saw Rhys. Clad in a black tux from Shore\u2019s, he stood next to the minister in front of the flagstone fireplace.</p><p>As she moved toward him, Megan overheard several of her friends remarking on what a hunk Rhys was, whispering how lucky she was to have him. She couldn\u2019t have agreed more.</p><p>He smiled at her then, a slow, sexy smile that released a million happy butterflies in her stomach. Her heart swelled with love, and she knew, deep inside, that choosing to stay with Rhys had been the right decision.</p><p>When the minister asked if she would have Rhys Costain as her husband for the rest of her life, Megan smiled inwardly, thinking that the minister had no idea just how long that might be.</p><p>Moments later, her husband swept her into his arms and claimed her lips with his in a long, slow kiss that turned her legs to jelly and set her blood on fire, and she knew without a doubt that no matter what the future held, she would face it unafraid as long as Rhys stood beside her.</p><p>Smiling, she looked up into his eyes. \u201cAnd just like in the fairy tales,\u201d she murmured, \u201cthey lived happily ever after.\u201d</p>  </body></html>"]
