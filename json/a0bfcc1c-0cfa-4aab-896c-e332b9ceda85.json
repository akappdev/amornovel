Although 36 was the highway that ran across the mountains from Red Bluff to Fortuna, it was mostly two lane. She put her cherry-red Jeep SUV in Park and stepped out of the vehicle. The rain had finally stopped, giving way to a bright summer sun, but the road was wet and splattered with muddy puddles. She peered way up the road to see a man wearing a bright orange vest holding a stop sign toward a long string of cars, closing both lanes. The turnoff to her Uncle Walt\u2019s would be on the other side of the next hill.</p><p>She picked her way around puddles to the truck parked in front of her, intending to ask the driver if he knew what was going on. When she got to the driver\u2019s window she smiled. \u201cWell, hey, Doc.\u201d</p><p>Doc Mullins looked out the open window. \u201cHey, yourself, little girl. Up here for a weekend of riding?\u201d he asked with his usual grumpy tone.</p> <p>\u201cNot this time, Doc. I sold my mother\u2019s house in Bodega Bay,\u201d she said. \u201cPacked up the bare essentials and am moving in with Uncle Walt for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPermanently?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. For a few months, though. I\u2019m still in transition.\u201d</p><p>Doc\u2019s grimace melted slightly, but only slightly. \u201cOnce again, condolences on your loss, Shelby,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope you\u2019re doing all right with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter all the time, thanks. My mom was ready to go.\u201d She tilted her head up the road. \u201cHave any idea what\u2019s holding us up here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSoft shoulder gave out,\u201d he said. \u201cI passed it on my way to Valley Hospital. Dumped half this lane down the hill. They\u2019re repairing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuardrails would be nice,\u201d she observed.</p><p>\u201cOnly around the tight curves,\u201d he said. \u201cOn a straightaway like this, we\u2019re on our own. Damn lucky a car or truck didn\u2019t go with that soft shoulder. It\u2019s going to be like this the next few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce I get to Walt\u2019s, I\u2019m not planning to be on this road again, for a while anyway,\u201d she said with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you planning, if I might ask?\u201d Doc said, lifting one of his bushy eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cWell, while I\u2019m visiting the family, I\u2019ll be making applications to schools. Nursing,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cA fairly obvious choice for me after taking care of my mother for years.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAch, just what I need,\u201d he said with his usual scowl. \u201cAnother nurse. Drive me to drink.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him. \u201cAt least we won\u2019t have to drive you far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s just what I mean. Another impertinent one, at that,\u201d he clarified.</p><p>She laughed again, loving this ornery old guy. Shelby turned, Doc leaned out of his window and both of them watched a man approach from the truck that had stopped behind Shelby\u2019s Jeep. He walked toward them. His hair was shaved down in that military fashion she\u2019d been accustomed to all her life; her uncle was a retired army general. A black T-shirt was stretched tight over broad, hard shoulders, his waist narrow, his hips slim and legs long. But what fascinated her was the way he came toward them, with an economy of movement. Deliberate. Confident. Cocky. His thumbs were hooked into front pockets and he sauntered. When he got closer, she could see his very slight smile as he looked at her, or looked her over, to be more precise. Sizing her up with glowing eyes. In your dreams, she thought, which caused her to smile back.</p><p>As he passed her Jeep, he glanced inside at all the packed-up boxes, then continued to where she was standing beside Doc\u2019s open window. \u201cThat yours?\u201d he asked, jutting his chin toward the Jeep.</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you headed?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cVirgin River. You?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe same.\u201d He grinned. \u201cAny idea what\u2019s going on up there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCollapsed shoulder,\u201d Doc said with a grunt. \u201cThey have us down to one lane for repairs. What\u2019s your business in Virgin River?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have some old cabins along the river there.\u201d He glanced between them. \u201cYou two live in the town?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI have family there,\u201d Shelby said. She stuck out her hand. \u201cI\u2019m Shelby.\u201d</p><p>He took her small hand. \u201cLuke. Luke Riordan.\u201d He turned toward Doc, putting out his hand again. \u201cSir?\u201d</p><p>Doc didn\u2019t extend a hand, but rather gave a nod. His hands were so twisted with arthritis, he never risked a handshake. \u201cMullins,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDoc Mullins has lived in Virgin River all his life. He\u2019s the town doctor,\u201d Shelby explained to Luke.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, sir,\u201d Luke said.</p><p>\u201cAnother jarhead?\u201d Doc asked, lifting one white, spiking eyebrow.</p><p>Luke straightened. \u201cI beg your pardon,\u201d he said. \u201cArmy. Sir.\u201d Then he looked at Shelby. \u201cAnother marine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few of our friends who work in town are marines. Retired or discharged. Their friends come around sometimes\u2014some of them are still active or in the reserves,\u201d she explained. \u201cBut my uncle, who I\u2019ll be living with for a while, was Army. Retired.\u201d She grinned. \u201cYou won\u2019t stand out that much with your hairdo. I don\u2019t know what it is with you guys and the buzz cuts.\u201d</p><p>He smiled patiently. \u201cWe\u2019ve never been checked out on those dryer things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Blow-dryers. Right.\u201d</p><p>As they waited in their stalled lane, the second lane was opened up to let a big yellow school bus pass. Judging by the number of vehicles waiting in their lane, they weren\u2019t going anywhere anytime soon, so there was no great rush to get back to their cars. They remained standing on the road, which ended up being a big mistake for Luke. As he saw the bus barreling down the other lane, Luke also noted a sizable puddle in front of it. He quickly put himself between Shelby and the bus, pressing her up against Doc\u2019s open window. With a hand on each side of her, he covered her with his body, barely in time to feel the splat from the puddle against his back.</p><p>Shelby stifled a chuckle. Macho man, she thought with some humor.</p><p>Luke heard downshifting, then the squeal of brakes. \u201cJesus,\u201d he muttered as he backed off the girl and glared after the bus.</p><p>As Luke turned and scowled at the bus, the driver leaned out the window. A round-faced woman in her fifties, rosy cheeked with a cap of short dark hair, grinned at him. She grinned! \u201cSorry, buddy,\u201d she said. \u201cCouldn\u2019t hardly help that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could if you went a lot slower,\u201d he yelled back at her.</p><p>To his astonishment, she laughed. \u201cAw, I wasn\u2019t going too fast. I got a schedule, y\u2019know,\u201d she yelled. \u201cMy advice? Stay out of the way.\u201d</p><p>His scalp felt hot under his short hair and he really wanted to swear. When he turned back to Shelby and Doc, he found her smiling behind her hand and Doc\u2019s eyes twinkling. \u201cYou got a little splatter on your back there, Luke,\u201d she said, trying to keep control of her lips.</p><p>Doc\u2019s face was the same\u2014cranky and impatient, but for the glittering eyes. \u201cMolly\u2019s been slinging that big yellow tube around these mountains for thirty years now, and ain\u2019t nobody knows these roads better. Guess she didn\u2019t see a pothole this once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not even September yet!\u201d Luke protested.</p><p>\u201cShe drives year-round,\u201d Doc said. \u201cSummer school, special programs, athletics. Always something going on. She\u2019s a saint\u2014you couldn\u2019t pay me enough to do that job. What\u2019s a mud puddle here and there?\u201d Then the old doctor put his truck noisily in gear. \u201cOur turn coming up.\u201d</p><p>Shelby jogged back toward her Jeep. Luke started to walk back toward his truck, which pulled a camper. Then he heard Doc, shouting at his back, \u201cWelcome to Virgin River, son. Enjoy yourself.\u201d And it was followed by a cackle.</p><p>Shelby McIntyre had been fixing up her deceased mother\u2019s house for months, but she\u2019d been able to drive up to Virgin River from Bodega Bay nearly every weekend through the summer to ride. And her Uncle Walt had paid many a visit to her to oversee renovation work that he\u2019d personally contracted. By the end of summer Shelby had roses on her cheeks. She had rolled up her shorts and her legs were tanned. Her thighs and butt had developed firm riding muscles and her eyes sparkled with health. It had been years since she\u2019d benefited from that type of regular exercise.</p><p>But when she pulled up in front of Walt\u2019s house now, in mid-August, it was a completely different feeling. The house was sold, her belongings were in the back of her Jeep, and at the age of twenty-five, she was embarking on a brand-new life. She gave the horn a toot, got out of her Jeep and stretched. In just moments, Uncle Walt came out the front door, stood there with his hands on his hips, a big grin on his face. \u201cWelcome back,\u201d he said. \u201cOr should I say, welcome home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey there,\u201d she said, walking into his arms. Walt was six feet with thick, silver hair, dark bushy brows and shoulders and arms like a wrestler\u2019s. He was a powerfully built man for just over sixty.</p><p>He hugged her tight. \u201cI was just about to go to the stable and saddle up. You too tired? You hungry or anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m dying to get on a horse, but I think I\u2019ll pass after riding in a Jeep for over four hours,\u201d she said.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cBackside pretty well broken in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOhhh,\u201d she said, rubbing her butt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just riding down along the river for an hour or so. Vanni\u2019s down at the new construction, getting in Paul\u2019s business, but she\u2019s going to be back in time to cook you a nice welcome-home dinner.\u201d</p><p>Shelby looked at her watch. It was only three-thirty. \u201cTell you what\u2014I\u2019m going to run into town while you go for your ride and Vanni inspects her new house. I\u2019ll say hi to Mel Sheridan and see if I can talk her into a beer to celebrate my change of residence. I\u2019ll be back in time to help with the horses before dinner. Should I get this stuff out of the Jeep first? Take it inside?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHoney, leave it be, no one\u2019s gonna bother it. Paul and I will unload you before supper.\u201d</p><p>She grinned at him. \u201cLet\u2019s make a date for tomorrow morning. We\u2019ll have that ride together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood deal. No trouble closing on the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a little more emotional than I expected. I thought I was ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegrets?\u201d</p><p>She turned her large hazel eyes up to his face. \u201cI cried for the first fifty miles,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then I started to get excited. I\u2019m sure about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said, giving her a squeeze. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust for a few months. Then I\u2019m going to travel a little and get a head start on school. It\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve been a student.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife here is usually pretty laid-back. Take advantage of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2014\u201d she laughed \u201c\u2014when you\u2019re not having shoot-outs or forest fires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, hell, girl, we want to keep things interesting!\u201d He walked her to her Jeep.</p><p>\u201cWait for me to get back to muck the stalls and feed the horses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnjoy a little girlfriend time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s something you haven\u2019t had enough of the past few years. You\u2019ll have plenty of horseshit to muck while you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Uncle Walt,\u201d she said and laughed. \u201cI won\u2019t be too long.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her forehead. \u201cI said, take your time. You took good care of my sister. You\u2019ve earned piles of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you in a couple of hours,\u201d Shelby said, heading for town.</p><p>Luke Riordan pulled into Virgin River, his Harley strapped into the back of his extended-cab truck, pulling his small camper. It had been seven years since he\u2019d seen this town and there had been a few changes. The church was now boarded up, but what he remembered as an old, abandoned cabin in the center of town was renovated, had cars and trucks parked around the front porch, and an Open sign in the window. It looked like some construction was under way behind the cabin; it was framed for an add-on. Since he was considering a renovation project of his own, he wouldn\u2019t mind having a look at what had been done to this place. He parked off to the side, out of the way, and got out of the truck. He went into the camper and changed out of his muddy shirt before going inside. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The August afternoon was warm, with a cool, refreshing breeze; the night would be chilly in the mountains. He hadn\u2019t been out to the house he planned to live in, which had been vacant for a year. If it was uninhabitable, he had his camper. He took a deep breath. The air was so damn clean, it stung the lungs. Such a huge change from the deserts of Iraq and El Paso. Just what he\u2019d been needing.</p><p>He walked into the renovated cabin and found himself in a good-looking little country bar. He stood just inside the door and looked around appreciatively. The hardwood floors gleamed, hot embers glowed in the hearth, hunting and fishing trophies hung mounted on the walls. There were about a dozen tables and a long, shiny bar behind which there were shelves full of liquor and glasses surrounding a stuffed king salmon that must have weighed about forty pounds at the catch. A television, mounted high in a corner, was tuned to national news, the volume turned down. A couple of fishermen, identifiable by their khaki vests and hats, sat at one end of the bar playing cribbage. A few men in work shirts and jeans were having drinks at a nearby table. Luke looked at his watch: 4:00 p.m. He walked up to the bar.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I get you?\u201d the bartender asked.</p> <p>\u201cA cold draft, thanks. This place wasn\u2019t here the last time I was through town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been away a while then. I\u2019ve been open more than four years now. I bought it and turned it into this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you did a helluva job,\u201d he said, accepting the beer. \u201cI\u2019m going to be doing some remodeling myself.\u201d He stuck out his hand. \u201cLuke Riordan,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cJack Sheridan. Pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bought some old cabins along the Virgin that have been sitting empty and going downhill for years now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThose old Chapman cabins?\u201d Jack asked. \u201cThe old man died just last year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d Luke said. \u201cI was back here hunting with one of my brothers and a couple of friends when we first saw them. My brother and I thought the location, right on the river, might be worth some money. We noticed the cabins weren\u2019t in use and wanted to buy \u2019em and fix \u2019em up for a quick resale, turn \u2019em fast and make a couple of bucks. But old Chapman wouldn\u2019t even listen to an offer....\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would have left him homeless,\u201d Jack said, giving the bar a wipe with a cloth. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have had too many options, and he was all alone.\u201d</p><p>Luke took a drink of his icy beer. \u201cExactly. So we bought the whole property, including his house, and told him he could stay there, rent free, for life. It turned out to be seven years.\u201d</p><p>Jack grinned. \u201cSweet deal for him. Smart deal for you. Property doesn\u2019t come available around here that often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could see right off the land under those cabins was worth more than the buildings, right on the river like that. I haven\u2019t been able to get back here since, and my brother has only been up here once, just to have a look\u2014he said nothing had changed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat held you up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said, scratching the stubble on his chin. \u201cAfghanistan. Iraq. Fort Bliss and a few other places.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArmy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Twenty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did twenty in the Marine Corps,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI thought I\u2019d come up here and serve up a few drinks, fish and hunt for the next twenty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Sounds like a good plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy plan got derailed by a cute little nurse midwife by the name of Melinda.\u201d He grinned. \u201cI would\u2019ve been fine, but that woman does something to a pair of jeans that ought to be against the law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat so?\u201d Luke asked.</p> <p>\u201cAnyone can go fishing,\u201d Jack said with a satisfied smile.</p><p>Luke didn\u2019t mind seeing a man happy with his life. He smiled back. Then he asked, \u201cDid you do most of this work yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost. I got some help, but I like taking credit where I can. This bar is a custom job, delivered to me finished. I installed the shelves and laid the hardwood floors. I didn\u2019t trust myself with the plumbing and I screwed up the wiring enough to have to hire someone, but I\u2019m good with wood\u2014I managed to add a large one-room apartment onto the back to live in. My cook, Preacher, has it now and is adding on again\u2014his family\u2019s growing, but he likes living at the bar. You going to work on those cabins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to look at the house first. Chapman was already pretty old when we bought the whole business\u2014that house probably needs work. And I have no idea what shape the cabins are in, but I don\u2019t have anything better to do right now. Worst case, I can fix up the house and live in it for a while. Best case, I can renovate the house and the cabins and put \u2019em on the market.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your brother?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cStill active. Sean is stationed at Beale Air Force Base in the U-2. It\u2019s just me for now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do for the army?\u201d Jack asked him.</p><p>\u201cBlack Hawks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShew,\u201d Jack said, shaking his head. \u201cThey go in some real hot spots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it. I came out the hard way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou drive one in?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cHell, no,\u201d he said indignantly. \u201cI had to be shot down.\u201d</p><p>Jack laughed. \u201cMan. At least you got your twenty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t even the first time,\u201d Luke said. \u201cBut in a moment of sheer genius, I decided it should be the last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething tells me we\u2019ve been in some of the same places,\u201d Jack said. \u201cMaybe even at around the same time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaw some combat, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfghanistan, Somalia, Bosnia, Iraq. Twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMogadishu,\u201d Luke confirmed, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we left you boys in a mess. I hated that,\u201d Jack said. \u201cYou lost a lot of brothers. I\u2019m sorry, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was bad,\u201d Luke agreed. What started out as a relief mission sanctioned by the UN ended in a horrible uprising after the Marine Corps was pulled out and the army was left behind. Somalian warlord Aidid launched an attack that left eighteen U.S. Army soldiers dead and over ninety wounded in a bloody conflict. \u201cOne of these days, Jack, we\u2019ll get drunk and talk about the battles.\u201d</p><p>Jack reached out, grabbed Luke\u2019s upper arm and said, \u201cYou bet. Welcome to the neighborhood, brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, tell me where to go for a night out that might include women, who to call if I need help with the house or cabins and what hours I can get a beer here,\u201d Luke said.</p><p>\u201cBeen a long time since I\u2019ve been looking for women, buddy. The coastal towns have some nice spots\u2014try Fortuna or Eureka. There\u2019s the Brookstone Inn in Ferndale\u2014nice restaurant and bar. Old-town Eureka is always good. Then for something a little closer, there\u2019s a little bar in Garberville with a jukebox.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI remember seeing one or two pretty girls there. And I have just the guy for you if you need help with the remodel. A buddy of mine just moved a part of his family\u2019s construction company down here from Oregon and he\u2019s doing Preacher\u2019s add-on. He helped me finish my house. He\u2019s a helluva builder. Let me go get one of his cards.\u201d</p><p>Jack went into the back and hadn\u2019t been gone a minute when two women came into the bar and almost gave Luke a heart attack. A couple of pretty blondes, one in her thirties with curly golden hair and the other, much younger, with an unforgettable thick, honey-colored braid that hung down her back to her waist. The girl from the roadside; the one he saved from a muddy bath\u2014Shelby. Both of them were wearing tight jeans and boots. The golden girl had on a loose-knit sweater, while Shelby wore the same crisp white shirt from earlier, sleeves rolled, collar open and tied at the waist. He tried not to stare, but he couldn\u2019t help looking at them, though they hadn\u2019t noticed him at all. His immediate thought was that he wouldn\u2019t have to go as far as Garberville. They jumped up on bar stools just as Jack came from the back.</p><p>\u201cHey, baby,\u201d he said, leaning across the bar to the older of the two women, kissing her. Ah, Luke thought, those would be the illegal jeans that keep him from fishing. What man wouldn\u2019t give up fishing to spend more of his time with a woman like that? \u201cMeet a new neighbor. Luke Riordan, this is Mel, my wife, and Shelby McIntyre\u2014she has family here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPleasure,\u201d he said to the women.</p><p>\u201cLuke here owns those old Chapman cabins on the river and he\u2019s thinking of renovating. He\u2019s ex-army, so we\u2019re gonna let him stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelcome,\u201d Mel said.</p><p>Shelby said nothing. She smiled at him, letting her eyelids drop a bit. He judged her to be about eighteen, just a girl. In fact, if she\u2019d been any older, he might\u2019ve gotten a phone number out there on the muddy road. Eureka or the Brookstone couldn\u2019t beat this, though both these women were obviously completely off-limits\u2014Mel was Jack\u2019s woman and Shelby appeared to be a teenager. A very sexy teenager, he thought with a slight flush of warmth. But their appearance held promise. If two such beautiful women could be found in a little bar in Virgin River, there had to be a few more scattered around these mountains.</p><p>\u201cHere you go,\u201d Jack said, sliding a business card across the bar. \u201cMy buddy Paul. Right now he\u2019s also building a house for my younger sister, Brie, and her husband next door to us. Plus one for himself and his wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy cousin,\u201d Shelby said.</p><p>Luke lifted his eyebrows in question.</p><p>\u201cWell, Paul\u2019s married to my cousin Vanessa. They\u2019re staying at my Uncle Walt\u2019s and I\u2019m staying with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want a beer, Mel?\u201d Jack asked his wife. \u201cShelby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a quick soda with Shelby, then I\u2019m going home to relieve Brie of the kids so she can have dinner with Mike,\u201d Mel said. \u201cI just wanted to swing through and tell you where I\u2019ll be. I\u2019ll feed the kids and put them to bed. Will you bring us some of Preacher\u2019s dinner when you come home later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe happy to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m going home to help with the horses,\u201d Shelby said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll have a beer first.\u201d</p><p>Well, at least she was twenty-one, Luke found himself thinking. Unless Jack had some very relaxed age standards in this little neighborhood bar, which was entirely possible.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d probably better get going\u2014\u201d Luke said.</p><p>\u201cHang around,\u201d Jack said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have to go, five o\u2019clock usually brings out the regulars. Perfect opportunity to meet your neighbors.\u201d</p><p>Luke looked at his watch. \u201cI guess I can hang out a while.\u201d</p><p>Jack laughed. \u201cBuddy, the first thing that\u2019s gonna go is that watch.\u201d Jack put a beer in front of Shelby, a cola in front of his wife.</p><p>Luke talked with Jack a while about the renovation of the bar while the women were occupied with their own conversation. Not ten minutes had passed when Jack said, \u201cExcuse me, I\u2019m going to walk my wife out,\u201d and Luke was left at the bar with Shelby.</p><p>\u201cI see you changed clothes,\u201d Shelby said to him.</p><p>\u201cUm, that was pretty necessary. The schoolmarm got me good.\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly. \u201cI never thanked you. For saving my blouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thanks necessary,\u201d he said, sipping his beer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen those cabins,\u201d Shelby said. \u201cI like to ride along the river. They look pretty awful.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised to hear that. With any luck, they\u2019re not beyond hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were built a long time ago when people used quality materials,\u201d she said. \u201cI learn these things from my cousin\u2014some of these old houses are built like brick shit\u2014Um. Well. So, do you expect your family to join you here?\u201d she asked him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He grinned into his beer. And the question, so quick and to the point, surprised him. He lifted his eyes from his beer and looked at her. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a mother and brothers scattered around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo wife?\u201d she asked, one corner of her mouth tilting upward along with the slight lift of one pretty brow.</p><p>\u201cNo wife,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cAw. Too bad,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to feel sorry for me, Shelby. I happen to like it this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSolitary kind of guy, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Just an unmarried kind of guy.\u201d He knew this was his cue to ask her if she was attached to someone special, but it was irrelevant. He wasn\u2019t going there. And while he knew getting to know her better probably wasn\u2019t wise, he put an elbow on the bar, leaned his head on his hand, met her eyes and said, \u201cJust visiting, huh?\u201d</p><p>She took a drink of her beer, nodding.</p> <p>\u201cHow long are you in town for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s still kind of up in the air,\u201d she said. Jack was back behind the bar and Shelby put down her glass, still half-full, and a couple of dollars on the bar. \u201cI\u2019d better go take care of those horses. Thanks, Jack.\u201d</p><p>Jack turned toward her. \u201cShelby, why don\u2019t you just ask for half a beer?\u201d he said.</p><p>She shrugged, smiling. She put out her hand to Luke. \u201cNice seeing you again, Luke. Later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said, taking her hand. As she left, he watched her walk out. He didn\u2019t want to do that, but the view was impossible to resist. When he looked back at Jack, Jack grinned, then got busy behind the bar.</p><p>Before seven o\u2019clock Luke had met Preacher\u2014or John to his wife and young stepson. He met Paige, Preacher\u2019s wife, and Jack\u2019s younger sister Brie and her husband, Mike. He saw old Doc Mullins again and passed the time with some of his new neighbors. He feasted on some of the best salmon he\u2019d ever eaten, heard some local lore and was already feeling like one of the gang. While he was there others passed through for dinner and drinks, greeting Jack and Preacher like old pals.</p> <p>Another couple entered and Luke was introduced to Paul Haggerty, the builder, and his wife, Vanessa. \u201cJack gave me a call,\u201d Paul said. \u201cHe tells me we have you as a new neighbor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s optimistic,\u201d Luke said. \u201cI haven\u2019t been out to the property yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that your camper out there?\u201d Paul asked.</p><p>\u201cAs a precaution,\u201d Luke said with a laugh. \u201cIf the house isn\u2019t habitable, I won\u2019t have to sleep in the truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe sure and let me know if you need me to look at any of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate that. More than you realize.\u201d</p><p>Luke found himself staying at the bar far later than he had intended. In fact, when Jack\u2019s friends were saying good-night, he was still there, having a cup of coffee with Jack. These seemed like nice people, though he was a little shell-shocked by the women. He could accept the idea that Jack had found himself a young beauty right in Virgin River, but it seemed they were everywhere. Shelby, Paige, Brie and Vanessa were all damn sweet-looking. He held out great hope of landing himself at least a little diversion in the next town over.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to want to meet Paul\u2019s father-in-law, Walt,\u201d Jack said. \u201cHe\u2019s retired army.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Luke asked. \u201cI think Shelby mentioned that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree-star. Nice guy.\u201d</p><p>Luke groaned in spite of himself. He actually dropped his head. And apparently Jack was reading him.</p><p>\u201cYep. Shelby\u2019s Uncle Walt,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cShelby. The eighteen-year-old?\u201d</p><p>Jack chuckled. \u201cShe\u2019s a little older than that. But I admit, young. Looker, though, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>That was impossible to miss, Luke thought. \u201cI took one look at her and felt like I was going to get arrested,\u201d he said, making Jack laugh. \u201cHow much more dangerous could she be, huh? Young, sweet and living with a three-star.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jack laughed. \u201cBut hell, she\u2019s all grown up now. Grew up fine, I\u2019d say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m not getting near that,\u201d Luke said.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>Luke stood up, put money on the bar, put out his hand and said, \u201cThanks, Jack. I really didn\u2019t expect this kind of welcome. I\u2019m glad I shot through town before going out to the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet us know if we can do anything to help. Nice having you with us, soldier. You\u2019re going to like it here.\u201d</p><p>Two</p><p>It was typical of the Sheridans to have their dinner together at the bar, often with friends and family, and then Jack would load up his little family and send them home so Mel could put the children to bed while he stayed on, serving until closing. On this particular night, Mel had hurried home to relieve Brie of babysitting. Jack snuck out of the bar a little early and brought their dinner home.</p><p>It could still amaze him, the satisfaction he felt when he went home to his family. Three years ago he was a single man, living in a room built onto his bar, completely disinterested in a domestic tether like this. Now he couldn\u2019t imagine any other kind of life. He kept thinking that the strength of his feelings for his wife should settle into a kind of complacency by now, and yet his passion for her, the depth of his love, only grew by the day. She had wound her sweet love around his heart and owned him, body and soul. He didn\u2019t know how he\u2019d lived so long without it; didn\u2019t know why other men evaded it, and he finally understood his friends who\u2019d lived this life for years.</p><p>It was nothing fancy: a meal at the kitchen table, some conversation about the building at the bar, the new guy in town, Shelby\u2019s return for a nice long visit while she applied to colleges. But for Jack it was the most important part of his day, that time he had Mel all to himself, the kids tucked in for the night.</p><p>When the dishes were cleaned up, Mel headed for the shower first. Jack brought in logs and laid a fresh fire in the master-bedroom hearth\u2014the nights were already getting brisk. Fall came early in the mountains. When that was done, he went around the house collecting trash to take to the town Dumpster in the morning. He pulled off his boots by the back door and as he passed the laundry room, he tugged off his shirt and socks and left them on the washer. By the time he got back to his bedroom, the shower had stopped running. He hung his belt in the closet and went to the master bath.</p><p>As he stood in the doorway, he caught Mel in front of the mirror, quickly pulling her towel closed over herself. She had a guilty look on her face as she met his eyes in the mirror. \u201cMelinda, what are you doing?\u201d he asked, unzipping his jeans to take them off and take a shower of his own.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she said, averting her eyes.</p><p>He frowned and stepped toward her. He lifted her chin and looked into her eyes. \u201cWere you covering up? In front of me?\u201d he asked, astonished.</p><p>\u201cJack, I\u2019m going to pot,\u201d she said, cinching the towel tighter.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, laughter in his voice. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cMy boobs are drooping, my butt fell into my thighs, I have a potbelly, and if that\u2019s not bad enough, I\u2019m so covered with stretch marks, I look like a deflated balloon.\u201d She put a hand against his rock-hard chest. \u201cYou\u2019re eight years older than I am and you\u2019re in perfect shape.\u201d</p><p>He started to laugh. \u201cI thought you were trying to cover a tattoo or something. Mel, I didn\u2019t have two children, a year apart. Emma\u2019s only a few months old. Give yourself a little time, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it. I miss my old body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh-oh,\u201d he said, putting his arms around her. \u201cIf you\u2019re thinking like that, I\u2019m not doing my job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s true,\u201d she said, laying her head against the soft mat of hair on his chest.</p><p>\u201cMel, you are more beautiful every day. I love your body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what it was...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. But it\u2019s better,\u201d he said. He tugged at the towel and she hung on. \u201cCome on,\u201d he said. She let go and he pulled it away. \u201cAh,\u201d he said, smiling down at her. \u201cThis body is amazing to me\u2014incredible. More lush and irresistible every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t mean that,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cBut I do.\u201d He leaned down and touched her lips with his, one hand on her breast, the other moving smoothly down her back and over her bottom. \u201cThis body has given me so much\u2014I worship this body.\u201d He lifted her breast slightly. \u201cLook,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t bear it,\u201d she complained.</p><p>\u201cLook, Mel. Look in the mirror. Sometimes when I see you like this, uncovered, I can\u2019t breathe. Every small change just makes you better, more delicious to me. You can\u2019t think I\u2019d have anything but complete admiration for the body that gave me my children. You give me so much pleasure, sometimes I think I might be losing my mind. Baby, you\u2019re perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m twenty pounds heavier than when you met me,\u201d she said.</p><p>He laughed at her. \u201cWhat are you now? A size four?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything. It\u2019s much more than a four. We\u2019re headed for double digits...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod above,\u201d he said. \u201cTwenty more pounds for me to gobble up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I just keep getting fatter and fatter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you still be in there? Because it\u2019s you I love. I love your body, Mel, because it\u2019s you. You understand that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I had an accident that blew my legs off, would you stop loving me, wanting me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not! That\u2019s not the same thing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not our bodies. We\u2019ve been lucky with our bodies, but we\u2019re more than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was my butt in a pair of jeans that got your attention....\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy love for you is a lot deeper than that, and you know it. However\u2014\u201d he grinned \u201c\u2014you still knock me out in those jeans. If you\u2019ve gained twenty pounds, it went to all the right places.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking\u2014tummy tuck,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat nonsense,\u201d he said, leaning down to cover her mouth in a bold and serious kiss. His hands were moving up and down her bare back and before seconds had passed, she was losing herself in his touch. \u201cThe first time we made love, I thought it was the best love I\u2019d ever had. Ever. The best experience of my life. I really didn\u2019t think it could get better\u2014but it does. Every time, richer and deeper than the time before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to stop eating Preacher\u2019s fattening food,\u201d she said, but she said it a little breathlessly. \u201cI\u2019m going to insist he start making salads.\u201d</p><p>He took her hand in his and put her palm against his belly, sliding it down. \u201cI\u2019m not going to have time for that shower,\u201d he said, his voice husky. His lips went to her neck. \u201cUnless you want to get back in, with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know how much I wanted you that first night?\u201d he whispered against her cheek. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted you more every night since. Come on,\u201d he said, bending and lifting her into his arms. \u201cI\u2019m going to show you how beautiful you are.\u201d He carried her to the bed, laid her softly on the sheets and knelt over her, an arm braced on each side. \u201cWant me to light the fire?\u201d he asked with a chuckle.</p><p>She ran her hands down over his narrow hips, sliding his jeans lower. \u201cJack, if you start to find me unattractive, will you tell me? Please? While there\u2019s still time for me to do something about it?\u201d</p><p>He covered her mouth, kissing her deeply. \u201cIf that ever happens, Melinda, I\u2019ll be sure to tell you.\u201d He kissed her again. \u201cGod, you taste good.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t taste bad,\u201d she whispered, letting her eyes fall closed.</p><p>\u201cAny special requests?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cEverything you do is special,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll just do everything....\u201d</p><p>When Luke pulled up to the house and cabins in the dark of night, he used a big flashlight to illuminate them. The electricity had been shut off last year when old Mr. Chapman passed. All he could really make out was a house black as pitch and a few cabins with peeling shingles and some boarded-up windows. A closer inspection had to wait until morning.</p><p>But the sound of the rushing river was awesome. What a great locale this was for the time being. He remembered how much he\u2019d liked this place the first time he\u2019d seen it\u2014the sound of the river, the owls, the wind through the pines making that whistling sound, the occasional bark of a goose or quack of a duck. Although it was cold, he pulled out extra blankets and planned to sleep with one of the camper\u2019s windows open so he could hear the river and the wildlife.</p><p>At the first light of morning, he pulled on his jeans and boots and went outside to a morning that was just turning pink, the air crisp and damp. Just down the bank he could see the river rushing over natural waterfalls where, in fall, the salmon would be jumping upstream to spawn. On the opposite side of the river were four deer having a drink. And\u2014unsurprisingly\u2014the house and cabins looked like hell. What a pimple on the face of this beautiful landscape.</p><p>Exactly what he expected. A lot of work ahead, but great potential. They could sell it right now for the value of the land, or he could improve the structures and get a much better price. And he needed something constructive to do while he plotted his next move. He could scout around for a helicopter flying job. There were news choppers, medical transport, private industry. He took a deep breath. But for right now, this little piece of river land was perfect.</p> <p>He went first to inspect the house. The porch out front was nice and big, but would have to be reinforced, sanded and stained or painted. The door was stuck and he had to force it, splintering some of the rotting wood around the jamb. Of course the place was filthy\u2014not only had it not seen a good cleaning in a long while before Mr. Chapman\u2019s death, in the year since, a couple of animals had burrowed in and taken roost. He heard the sound of scurrying, saw footprints on the dusty floor, and the countertops suggested a menagerie. The place would be full of mice, raccoons, maybe opossums. Hopefully the bear didn\u2019t have a den in here. He\u2019d be sleeping in the camper for a while.</p><p>It didn\u2019t have a good smell, either. Everything was left as it was the day Mr. Chapman passed\u2014the bed was even mussed as though he\u2019d just gotten out of it. Dirty clothes littered the floor, there was rotten and petrified food in the kitchen, all the furniture was still in place. Nasty, musty, stained furniture that was on its very last legs. The appliances also seemed to be about a million years old and the refrigerator had never been cleaned out before the electricity was shut off. It was completely destroyed by odors that would have to be blasted out.</p><p>Right inside the front door was a decent-size living room with a good-looking stone hearth. To the immediate left was a large, empty dining room separated from the kitchen by a breakfast bar that was sagging. The kitchen was big enough for a table and four chairs or, better still, a butcher-block island.</p><p>Straight ahead was a short hall\u2014on one side a big bathroom with a clawfoot tub, on the other, a utility room. Straight ahead was a bedroom. No walk-in closet here\u2014this was an old-fashioned house. The old man had left large, man-size bureaus and wardrobes. The bed was a big, wooden four-poster. Luke didn\u2019t much like the furniture, but he thought since it was solid, heavy, durable ash, it was probably valuable.</p><p>He made a U-turn and went back to the living room. There he found a staircase to the second floor. He went up cautiously, not sure of the reliability of the steps. Plus, it was dark up there. If he remembered, there were two good-size bedrooms and no bath. More scurrying. He ran back down the steps. He could look up there after the exterminator had paid a visit.</p><p>Standing in the living room, he did a mental inventory. The good news was, it didn\u2019t appear the place had to be gutted and completely remodeled to make it livable. The bad news was, what had to be done was going to be expensive and time consuming. Everything but the ash bedroom furniture needed to go away. Far away. It wasn\u2019t even up to secondhand standards. The floors would have to be sanded, the cupboards torn out and replaced, new countertops would have to be installed, the old wallpaper stripped, windowsills, doors, frames, baseboards sanded and stained, or maybe just replaced.</p> <p>But first, the amount of trash hauling and pest removal was going to be a giant pain in the butt. At least this was work he could do, with the help of an exterminator. He\u2019d inspect the roof later.</p><p>He walked out of the house and pried open the door to the first cabin. More of the same. The furniture was rotting, the floor was covered with debris. The cabins were all one-room efficiencies that hadn\u2019t been used in years, so the small stoves and bar-size refrigerators were outdated and probably didn\u2019t work. He was good with wood and paint, but he didn\u2019t trust himself with gas and electricity. He was looking at six empty cabins, all in need of new hot-water heaters, stoves, refrigerators and furniture. He\u2019d have to get up on the roofs and see how they had held up through the years, but from where he stood, it looked as though the shingles were mostly missing or rotting. And the wood on the outside of the cabins, all in need of scraping, sanding and painting. Every window would have to be replaced.</p><p>He did a mental calculation. It was nearly September. From January to June, before the summer people came for camping and hiking, things were slow and wet around this part of the world. If he could get the house and cabins in shape by spring, he could put them on the market or open them up for rent to vacationers. If it turned out he was bored with the mountains by then, he\u2019d lock the whole business up and make tracks to either San Diego, where his brother Aiden was stationed and there was plenty of beach and swimsuits, or to Phoenix, where his widowed mother lived and would be forever grateful for his presence. He could always chase a flying job if he wanted to.</p><p>He unhooked the camper from the truck, unloaded his Harley from the truck bed and parked it up on its stand in front of the house. He grabbed a pair of work gloves, broom and shovel from the bed of the truck, got his toolbox out of the trailer and began scooping out the house. He could at least fill the back of the trunk with trash and, on his way to Eureka to have the utilities turned on, hire an exterminator and rent a big Dumpster; he could also dispose of a big load at the dump.</p><p>By noon he had a huge pile of trash in front of the porch. He got to work on loading the trash into the back of the pickup. The bright afternoon sun had warmed up the air and he was sweating like a farmhand, so he took off his shirt. He was just hefting a big three-legged overstuffed chair into the back of the truck when he spotted her. Holding it over his head, he froze.</p><p>She was sitting in the clearing astride a big American paint. She smiled at him. Pure, innocent honey. Luke couldn\u2019t move. The horse was beautiful, at least fifteen hands. She was wearing khaki shorts, rolled up high on her tanned thighs, a pair of what appeared to be laced hiking boots with white socks rolled over the tops, a white short-sleeved T-shirt and a khaki fishing vest. With that long, pale blond braid down her back and a Stetson on her head, she could be fifteen, tiny and built solid. The thought that she looked like a statutory offense came instantly to mind and he felt every day of his thirty-eight years.</p><p>The horse danced and pawed at the ground, snorted and reared his head, but this little girl in the saddle didn\u2019t even notice. She handled him with ease and finesse.</p><p>\u201cI just had to see this for myself,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re doing it. You\u2019re at work on this mess. Wow,\u201d she laughed. \u201cLooks like you\u2019re going to be busy.\u201d</p> <p>He tossed the chair in the back of the truck and took a rag out of his pocket to mop his sweating face. \u201cMaybe you can\u2019t see the potential here,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to impress you, in that case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m already impressed,\u201d she said. \u201cIt looks like a monumental job. Where I grew up, there were a bunch of old cabins just like this, out on the beach. I was a teenager. They were almost never in use and the local kids used to sneak in. To smoke pot and...other stuff. Then one day they were gone. Razed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you were a teenager,\u201d he said, shoving the rag back into his pocket. \u201cLast week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she laughed. \u201cI\u2019m talking ten years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn which case, you don\u2019t age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just ask?\u201d she challenged him.</p><p>\u201cOkay. How old are you? Exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty-five. And you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne hundred and ten.\u201d</p><p>She laughed again. When she did, she threw her head back and that braid rippled down her back. \u201cYeah, I thought you were probably really old. How old?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirty-eight. Pretty well out of your range.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat depends,\u201d she said with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cOn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn whether I have a range.\u201d</p><p>Oh God, he thought weakly. She liked him. Not a little teasing, but private flirting, just between the two of them. Luke was a man with few scruples and even less control. It wasn\u2019t a good idea for her to do this. She was too alluring for her own good. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty good with that horse. He\u2019s a beautiful paint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChico,\u201d she told him. \u201cAll little boy. Uncle Walt adopted him as colt\u2014you\u2019d think he\u2019d be better behaved. You know your horses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve flown over a lot of horses running wild in the desert. Incredible creatures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ride?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t been on a horse in years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fish?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWhen I get a chance. You hunt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cI\u2019d never shoot anything. But I shoot skeet, and I\u2019m good, too. Lately I garden and babysit. And I read a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he asked, stepping toward her.</p><p>\u201cIn Virgin River? I came to spend some time with my family for a while before going back to school. Uncle Walt, Vanessa and Paul, my cousin Tom\u2014he\u2019s at basic training, soon to have leave\u2014they\u2019re my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cHere. Checking me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet over yourself, I\u2019m checking out the cabins,\u201d she said, returning the smile. \u201cI rode here a few times last summer. I really thought these cabins would disappear someday. Wouldn\u2019t it be easier to build new ones?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might be easier, but it wouldn\u2019t be cheaper. And I was looking for something to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? You get fired from your job or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI retired from the army.\u201d</p><p>Her eyebrows shot up. \u201cLike my uncle!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not like your uncle. Like a warrant officer, helicopter pilot. Jack said your uncle is a retired three-star. A whole different thing, kid.\u201d</p><p>She grinned at him, but her cheeks took on a little flush. \u201cJust remember, he\u2019s retired. He really isn\u2019t in charge anymore.\u201d</p><p>He took note of the pinkened cheeks. She wanted to do this, obviously, this flirting. But it wasn\u2019t natural for her, he could see that. He could make it easier for her. He knew how to calm a woman down, put her at ease. In fact, he enjoyed it.</p><p>He was having an attack of pure lust and he told himself to nip it in the bud. She said twenty-five, but he thought there was a good chance in any bar other than Jack\u2019s, she\u2019d be carded. He grabbed his shirt off the porch railing to shrug into it.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that,\u201d she said. \u201cNot for me\u2014I\u2019m not staying. Just dropping by to see your project, that\u2019s all. I was in the neighborhood.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He chuckled and pulled on the shirt, but he left it unbuttoned. \u201cYeah. We\u2019re neighbors,\u201d he said, smiling up at her. \u201cI should be getting back to work, unless there\u2019s something you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be seeing you at Jack\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly place in town to get a beer, so I\u2019m sure you will.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell then. Good luck here,\u201d she said, lifting the reins. Chico reared, ready to be set free. \u201cLater,\u201d she yelled, leading her gelding away and out of the clearing to the river\u2019s edge. Luke watched the sight of her departure. Once she was through the trees, she kicked her horse into a run. She got low in the saddle and made that braid ride out behind her, she went so hard and fast. I\u2019m in for it now, Luke thought.</p><p>He watched her tiny, young butt move with the horse, confident in the saddle. Sweet heaven, what am I thinking? he asked himself. What am I feeling? She couldn\u2019t possibly know what a trim little beauty on a big horse did to him! This was almost the hugest mistake he\u2019d ever considered. But he couldn\u2019t escape the fact that he\u2019d like to get his hands all over her. He began to pray that he\u2019d have both intelligence and restraint where this one was concerned. But it would be a first.</p><p>Shelby rode back to her Uncle Walt\u2019s and all the way she was thinking how Luke might think she\u2019d been flirting, but he was absolutely not her type.</p><p>Shelby was totally focused on her plans. While waiting for acceptance to a school, she\u2019d travel some. Alone. She remembered the exhilaration of flying off to the East Coast or Europe to spend a couple of months with her cousins during summer. But she\u2019d never seen the Caribbean islands, Mexico, Italy, France or Japan. She\u2019d like to take a cruise, then a vacation\u2014maybe in Italy, the south of France or Cabo San Lucas. After she\u2019d had a nice little break to recharge, she would get herself set up at school, find a part-time job and take a few classes before her degree program officially began in the fall. Just to get herself back in the study groove.</p><p>But maybe she\u2019d have herself a little adventure in there somewhere. Maybe on her cruise, on one of her trips.</p> <p>Not with this kind of man, of course. He was too mature, for one thing. One look convinced her\u2014he knew everything about men and women, while she knew very little. He looked a little dangerous and very, very physical. Scary. He had that warrior appearance, complete with tattoos.</p><p>The sight of him bare-chested had rattled her, but the big horse beneath her had given her plenty of confidence. His shoulders were so large, strong and muscular, and he had a barbed-wire armband tattooed on his rippling left biceps. His belly was flat and hard with a trail of chest hair that disappeared into his jeans. The stubble along his jaw made his grin a little taunting and definitely naughty; it had made her shiver. And he had an aura of carelessness. He would take a bite of her, then pitch her out, forgetting her before morning.</p><p>But while Shelby had looked him over, everything inside her had grown warm. Something about him, a forbidden quality, was absolutely delicious. Even the damn dirt looked good on him. Despite her common sense, she wondered, wouldn\u2019t that be interesting? And her very next thought was, no, no, no, not him! My adventure will come in a polo shirt, cheeks as smooth as a baby\u2019s butt, styled hair, no tattoos and hopefully an advanced degree. Not some scary Black Hawk pilot who has a Ph.D. in one-night stands!</p><p>Mel stormed right into the bar\u2019s kitchen. Preacher had his hands in the sink, his back to her. \u201cHey, Preach,\u201d she said. But he didn\u2019t turn around. \u201cPreach?\u201d she asked again. Nothing. \u201cJohn!\u201d she yelled.</p><p>He jumped in surprise, turned toward her and pulled earplugs out of his ears. \u201cWhoa, Mel,\u201d he said. \u201cYou snuck up on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, not exactly,\u201d she said. \u201cI yelled.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, well, after a while all that noise makes my head pound. I\u2019d just go fishin\u2019, but I have things to do here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d she said, sitting on the stool at his work island. \u201cWe have to talk, you and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>She took a breath. \u201cI\u2019ve gained twenty pounds since I came here. Almost ten pounds a year. By the time I\u2019m forty, I\u2019ll weigh two hundred pounds.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. He wasn\u2019t sure what he was supposed to say. Finally he smiled a small smile and said, \u201cWell, good for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is not good!\u201d</p><p>He almost jumped at the angry tone in her voice. Then he frowned.</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d she said, \u201cyou have to start doing some cooking that isn\u2019t so fattening. Understand?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo one\u2019s ever complained about the cooking before, Mel. It tastes good...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know\u2014but you\u2019re cooking for men with real physical lives. Except you\u2014you stand in the kitchen all day and I know you sample everything. I don\u2019t know how you keep from getting fat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI clean a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cI lift weights\u2014but not as much with two kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, you have a lot of muscle, and that eats up calories. Women don\u2019t have that kind of muscle, John. You have to stop using so much cream and butter, that sort of thing. It\u2019s unhealthy anyway\u2014not good for weight, cholesterol and blood pressure, not good for the heart. Make some salads, more vegetables not swimming in butter. I can\u2019t be the only person in this town who\u2019s getting fat on your food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSalads?\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t usually make a lot of salads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know this,\u201d she said wearily. \u201cBut we need to make a couple of changes. Just minor changes. Buy some low-fat, whole-wheat bread for sandwiches. Don\u2019t do pastas, breads and potatoes at every meal. Make salads, stock fresh fruit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of fruit around here,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, and it\u2019s all in the pies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have pie almost every day,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cYou love my pies. You more than anyone, I think.\u201d</p><p>She scowled, then grimaced. \u201cI\u2019m going to stop doing that. Listen, can you make some lighter meals available, please? Or else I\u2019m not going to be able to eat here all the time. I\u2019ll have to pack a lunch, make my own dinner at home. This madness has to stop. I can\u2019t keep gaining weight like this. I am not going to be fat!\u201d</p><p>Preacher tilted his head. \u201cJack complaining about the way you look?\u201d he asked cautiously.</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d she said in frustration. \u201cHe thinks I\u2019m perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re paying attention here. I have to go on a diet. You want me to write down what I need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said unhappily. \u201cI think I\u2019ve got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. That\u2019s all I wanted. I need a little help here, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe want you happy,\u201d he said, caution in every word.</p><p>\u201cIt would make me happy.\u201d She slipped off the stool. \u201cThanks, that\u2019s all I wanted to talk to you about.\u201d</p><p>After she left, Preacher stood in his kitchen for a long time, thinking. Then he went out back where the men were at work. He spotted Jack standing in what used to be his bedroom, talking with Paul. They both wore hard hats while Preacher\u2019s head was bare. He waited. Finally Paul and Jack turned to look at him and Paul sighed and shook his head dismally; he took two giant steps away, grabbing a hard hat and handing it to Preacher.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you again,\u201d Paul said. \u201cYou don\u2019t come out here without protection for your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right,\u201d Preacher said, putting it on. Too small, it sat high on his head.</p><p>\u201cYou have the biggest head out here,\u201d Paul said. \u201cWe\u2019re framing the second story. You\u2019re an accident waiting to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I get it. Listen,\u201d Preacher said, turning his attention on Jack, \u201cMel was just here. She\u2019s complaining about the food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Jack answered. \u201cMel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. She says my food is making her fat.\u201d</p><p>Jack chuckled. \u201cOh, that. Yeah, she\u2019s making noises about that. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t make it sound like I shouldn\u2019t worry about it. She was pretty much loaded for bear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe had two babies in fourteen months, plus a hysterectomy. And\u2014she doesn\u2019t like to be reminded about this\u2014she\u2019s getting older in spite of herself. Women get a little thicker. You know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour sisters,\u201d Jack said. \u201cIt\u2019s all women ever worry about\u2014the size of their butts and boobs. And thighs\u2014thighs come up a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe yelled at me,\u201d he said, still kind of startled. Paul laughed and Jack just shook his head. \u201cDid you tell her that?\u201d Preacher asked. \u201cAbout women getting thicker with age?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look like I have a death wish? Besides, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s getting fat\u2014but my opinion about that doesn\u2019t count for much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wants salads. And fresh fruit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow hard is that?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cNot hard,\u201d Preacher said with a shrug. \u201cBut I don\u2019t stuff that pie down her neck every day.\u201d</p><p>A sputter of laughter escaped Paul, and Jack said, \u201cYou\u2019re gonna want to watch that, Preach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wants me to use less butter and cream, take a few calories out of my food. Jack, it isn\u2019t going to taste as good that way. You can\u2019t make sauces and gravies without cream, butter, fat, flour. People love that stuff, salmon in dill sauce, fettuccine Alfredo, stuffed trout, brisket and garlic mash. Stews with thick gravy. People come a long way for my food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know, Preach. You don\u2019t have to change everything\u2014but make Mel a little something, huh? A salad, a broiled chicken breast, fish without the cream sauce, that kind of thing. You know what to do. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. You don\u2019t think she wants everyone in this town on a diet? Because she says it\u2019s not healthy, the way I cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. This is a phase, I think. But if you don\u2019t want to hear any more about it, just give her lettuce.\u201d He grinned. \u201cAnd an apple instead of the pie.\u201d</p><p>Preacher shook his head. \u201cSee, I think no matter what she says, that\u2019s going to make her pissy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said it\u2019s what she wants, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay the force be with you,\u201d Jack said with a grin.</p><p>Three</p><p>The first couple of weeks in Virgin River, Shelby had to make some adjustments she hadn\u2019t expected. At the Booth household she was part of a family\u2014an active, busy, very present family in which she was the fifth member. It was a new experience.</p><p>When Tom came home from boot camp shortly after her arrival, for ten days of leave before going to West Point, the family grew again. Vanni and Paul brought the baby into their room and Shelby took the combination guest room/nursery so Tom could have his room back. And, if Tom wasn\u2019t missing from the household, his girlfriend, Brenda, was present with him\u2014they were inseparable. The Booth house was spacious, but Shelby felt they were packed in like sardines. She was used to having a lot of space in her tiny Bodega Bay house with just her mother. Periods of solitude. Quiet. There was no solitude now unless she went for a ride. And invariably, someone wanted to go with her.</p><p>There was a new development that took Shelby by complete surprise; she never even smelled it in the wind. Vanni whispered it to Shelby one night when Tommy was with Brenda and Walt was heading out the door. He said he was going for a beer, but Vanni said, \u201cBeer, my eye. I\u2019ll bet he\u2019s going over to see Muriel and that beer takes a long time to drink. We won\u2019t see him for dinner.\u201d Then she winked. \u201cDaddy\u2019s got a woman.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo way!\u201d Shelby said.</p><p>\u201cBelieve me,\u201d Vanni grinned. \u201cI suspected they were getting to be more than just neighbors, but then you arrived and Tom came home on leave, and he\u2019s been sticking around a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know her?\u201d</p> <p>Vanni smiled. \u201cEver see that movie Never Too Late?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Shelby said, perplexed. \u201cI loved that movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuriel St. Claire. She played the new divorc\u00e9e.\u201d</p><p>Shelby gasped. \u201cShe\u2019s here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe bought the ranch downriver a little over a mile. She retired to Virgin River, is done making movies and is restoring the house herself. I\u2019ve only seen Muriel and Dad in the same room three times\u2014they\u2019re playing it real cool. But let me tell you\u2014their eyes twinkle when they\u2019re together. I\u2019ve asked Dad if we can have her to dinner soon and he says he doesn\u2019t mind an evening away from the house now and then. He also says there\u2019s plenty of time for that. I think he\u2019s trying to keep her to himself. I\u2019d bet my life something hot\u2019s going on there, but neither of them will fess up. The second I ask questions, he clams right up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUncle Walt has a woman?\u201d Shelby asked in shock. \u201cA famous actress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it took him a long enough. I don\u2019t think it even crossed his mind after my mother died, five years ago. It\u2019s high time. Everyone needs someone. Age certainly has nothing to do with it. But I wish they\u2019d loosen up. I\u2019d like to hear about all the famous people she knows.\u201d</p><p>Now they all had a special someone, her young cousin, even her Uncle Walt.</p><p>As a teenager, Shelby had been in most ways a typical girl, if a little on the shy side. She got good grades, had girlfriends, was active in school activities. She\u2019d had a nice little part-time job at the library after school and had even gone through a few boyfriends. She went to games, slumber parties, dances. Her friends tended to run in a pack more often than as dating couples; some had high-school boyfriends who were serious, but most of them, including Shelby, were damn happy if they had dates to the homecoming dance or the prom.</p><p>She might\u2019ve been a little more cautious than the average teenage girl\u2014her mom had been very honest about her accidental pregnancy at the age of eighteen, her short marriage that had become a nonevent as she was divorced when Shelby was just a baby. No way Shelby was letting something like that happen to her. She knew she\u2019d be a late bloomer.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t thought it would be quite this late....</p> <p>Shelby was only nineteen when the life typical of a girl her age halted and a whole new set of responsibilities took over. Uncle Walt had been more than willing to cover the cost of nursing-home care for his sister, but Shelby had said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to be an issue for long. In fact, much sooner than I like to think about, she\u2019ll be gone. She gave me her whole adult life, always putting me first. If I don\u2019t give her a few years of mine, the rest of my life won\u2019t matter a damn.\u201d</p><p>Then it was over and time to think about what was ahead for her. Before Vanni had even uttered those words about Uncle Walt, Shelby had been thinking, I want to join the ranks of women my age, women who are my friends, both old and new, and have what they have\u2014the relationship building, romantic and physical love, idealism and passion and even the struggles. She wanted all of it. She was due. She wanted to be whole.</p><p>She wanted a man.</p><p>Walt gave a couple of taps on Muriel\u2019s guesthouse door, then pushed it open. Muriel had fixed up the old bunkhouse to live in while she worked on the larger house. Unlike most of the times he called on her, finding her in her work clothes and waiting for him to arrive before cleaning up, she was not only showered and changed, but had set a small table with plates and utensils and a candle in the middle. He smiled and handed her a sack of takeout from Jack\u2019s bar, then bent to scratch behind the ears of two excited Labs, Luce and Buff. \u201cLooks like a celebration,\u201d he said, indicating the table.</p><p>\u201cIt is. I finished the floors upstairs. One coat of paint in the bedroom and hall and I could live there if I wanted to. And yesterday I bought a pie safe for the dining room. I found it up near Arcata at this little antique shop. It\u2019s big\u2014I can\u2019t get it out of the truck bed, so I parked it in the barn. Maybe you\u2019ll help me tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>She looked in the sack. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrisket, steamed red potatoes, green and wax beans.\u201d</p> <p>She inhaled. \u201cPie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course pie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you tell your daughter and your niece you were going?\u201d she asked, tilting her head and smiling at him.</p><p>\u201cI told them I was going out for a beer,\u201d he answered. And grinned.</p><p>\u201cWalt,\u201d she admonished. \u201cDon\u2019t you think you\u2019re having a little too much fun with this? I bet you\u2019re not fooling anyone. Besides, I\u2019m not sure how I feel about being hidden like this.\u201d</p><p>He got a startled expression on his face. \u201cMuriel, I\u2019m not hiding you. Not at all! And I did have a beer, while I waited for the food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why haven\u2019t you invited me to dinner with the family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to come over for dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalt, I\u2019m not going to let you get away with this. Remember, I know what I\u2019m doing, I know about men. You\u2019re not moving forward, you\u2019re not backing off. I\u2019m more than happy to be your good friend, as long as nothing\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>He looked down briefly. \u201cAll right,\u201d he said uneasily. \u201cYou caught me. I\u2019m enjoying the hell out of this, Muriel. The riding, the dinners here with you, even when I\u2019m helping you paint or sand or move furniture. But...I\u2019m waiting for you to say something very Hollywood to me, like, I find romantic relationships pedestrian and beneath me. And I\u2019m dreading it.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him. \u201cWhat\u2019s this? Isn\u2019t this a relationship? And I\u2019m enjoying it, too. Besides, that\u2019s not what they say in Hollywood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do they say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s almost always in newsprint, right near the grocery checkout stand, and it usually sounds something like, St. Claire Caught In Sordid Affair. Or, St. Claire\u2019s Husband Seen With Swimsuit Model. Or hooker.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cOr something equally gauche.\u201d But he had such a soft expression on his hard, handsome face, it startled her eyes open wide. She put the take-out sack on the table and her hands on her hips. \u201cOh Jesus, you think I\u2019m letting you come over and pester me all the time because you\u2019re the only available man in my age group!\u201d</p><p>He lifted one black bushy brow. \u201cBut am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so irrelevant! Chasing a good-looking thirty-year-old was never beneath me!\u201d</p><p>She made him laugh. That was the linchpin\u2014she always made him laugh. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t surprise me. Not that there are many of those, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalt, for God\u2019s sake, I have my own transportation if Virgin River isn\u2019t amusing enough for me.\u201d She stalked over to him, put her arms on his shoulders, got up on her toes and laid a lip-lock on him that shocked his eyebrows up high and his eyes round. But she kept at him until he finally put his big arms around her slim body, pulled her hard against him, let his lips open, opened hers and experienced, for the first time since they met almost three months ago, a wholly passionate, wet, deep kiss. It was fantastic. Delicious. And long. When he finally relaxed his arms a bit, she pulled back and gave him a whack in the chest. \u201cNow stop being a fool or you\u2019re going to mess this up. I\u2019ll come to dinner Friday night. You cook. I\u2019ll bring wine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine,\u201d he said a little breathlessly. \u201cDinner. With the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot because I\u2019m getting ready to propose, but because I\u2019d like to know your family. And more to the point, they\u2019d like to know me, to be sure you\u2019re in no danger.\u201d She went to the sack and began removing cartons, placing them on the table.</p><p>\u201cDo you suppose we\u2019ll be doing that again?\u201d he asked. \u201cThat kind of kissing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeats the hell out of those little pecks and pats, don\u2019t you think?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI have to agree with that, yes,\u201d he answered. Leave it to some aging starlet to bring a tough old general to his knees. In fact, he thought he felt his knees wobbling and a slight vibration under his skin. Given a little more time, he was going to feel something else; something he didn\u2019t feel all that often, but often enough to know it still worked.</p><p>\u201cMaybe after brisket. I\u2019m a little annoyed with you at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShame,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m completely happy with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have to make the first move,\u201d she complained. \u201cJesus. Men. They\u2019re either too ambitious or not ambitious enough.\u201d Her phone rang and she said, \u201cExcuse me one second.\u201d</p><p>He listened to her side of the conversation. \u201cHmm...Well, much as I appreciate you keeping me in mind, it would take something monumental to pull me back into films.... A year from now? We\u2019ll see what you have a year from now, Mason. But really, I\u2019m not going back to Los Angeles for some shitty little supporting role in a B movie\u2014I\u2019m having too much fun. And I have horses and dogs\u2014they don\u2019t transport all that easily. No, it\u2019s not about the horses and dogs, it\u2019s about being retired from acting, and not convinced you have a worthwhile project where I\u2019m concerned. Fine, fine\u2014send the script and I\u2019ll look at it, but I highly doubt it\u2019s going to change my mind, so be prepared for that. Yes, Mason\u2014you, too.\u201d She hung up.</p><p>Walt had an unpleasant look on his face. \u201cYou mind if I ask...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMason. My agent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd ex-husband? Fifteen years older than you? Isn\u2019t he getting close to retirement himself...at seventy-one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d never know it. The man\u2019s going to be dancing on my grave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrying to get you to come back?\u201d Walt asked.</p><p>\u201cTrying to get me to work. And I\u2019m not inclined to do that....\u201d She looked at Walt and for just a second frowned at his frown. Then she laughed. \u201cOh, Walt, are you worried? Relax. He calls almost every day. He sends scripts sometimes\u2014nothing but junk. But Mason has always been one to throw everything he has at the wall to see what sticks.\u201d She walked up against him and rubbed her hands over his chest. \u201cReally, he\u2019d have to come at me with something as good as Cat on a Hot Tin Roof or Gone with the Wind to even get my attention.\u201d She smiled at him. \u201cNow, can we please have some of Preacher\u2019s brisket? You\u2019ve been a little high maintenance tonight. Not like you. And I\u2019m starving!\u201d</p><p>He ran his big rough hands through her soft blond hair. \u201cYou\u2019re starving? When we met, you didn\u2019t eat anything but celery and hummus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. And hanging out with you is starting to show on my rump.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks damn fine to me, Muriel. Light the candle and load up your plate.\u201d And he smiled.</p><p>A few days later, Vanessa and Shelby were in a fever of excitement as they tidied the house for their famous dinner guest. They would have her captive, to ask all the movie-star questions they were kicking around, trying them out on each other. They wanted the scoop, but didn\u2019t want to be a tabloidlike invasive. Of course, they wanted to know things like, who was the sexiest man you ever slept with?</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t ask that!\u201d Shelby said with a gasp.</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Vanessa agreed. \u201cTry to think if there\u2019s a way to ask her which big Hollywood hunk turned out to be the biggest dud?\u201d</p><p>Giggles erupted from both of them.</p><p>Walt listened to a lot of this from the kitchen. He had insisted he was cooking\u2014it was what he had promised Muriel. And he found himself wondering about the answer to those questions, himself. Vanessa and Shelby shouldn\u2019t ask, but given time, he might. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tom, who had only a couple more days of leave before West Point, brought Brenda. They arrived just minutes before Muriel, and once Brenda got with Vanni and Shelby, the level of excitement rose again.</p><p>When Muriel stepped into his house, she handed over two bottles of wine. Then she turned to find herself being stared down by three very expectant, excited, flushed female faces. She laughed. \u201cWell, now, before you get started, I don\u2019t kiss and tell.\u201d</p><p>Three pair of cheeks flamed, but they also melted into laughter.</p> <p>Things went easy after that. They sat together at the big dining-room table and had wine and hors d\u2019oeuvres and Hollywood questions. Vanni, Brenda and Shelby could give as good as they got\u2014they shared all the Virgin River gossip from as far back as they could remember or had heard. The thing was, if these young women had been true stargazers, they would know that Muriel only told stories that had already been reported and were common knowledge. She was crafty\u2014she\u2019d been down this road before. Her lifestyle was fantasy for the civilians. But she was being completely honest, she didn\u2019t kiss and tell. She knew things the Enquirer would pay good money for. It was in the vault of her memory.</p><p>As far as she could tell, all the Virgin River stories, from hot romances to fights, deaths, despair and victories, were real. \u201cAnd one of the most talked-about romances in town at the moment is between a certain very popular, accomplished high-school senior and a West Point cadet,\u201d Vanni said, lifting an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Brenda said in shock. \u201cPeople talk about us?\u201d</p><p>Everyone laughed that she could be so naive.</p><p>\u201cDo they say anything bad?\u201d she wanted to know, and they laughed harder.</p> <p>Finally it was Muriel who said, \u201cOf course not, Brenda. You\u2019re the darling couple. Everyone roots for you to make it through West Point and college, staying together. You seem perfect for each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d she asked, lifting her head, straightening her neck proudly. It was quite something at seventeen to be complimented by someone like Muriel St. Claire.</p><p>Although they were at it till quite late, through coffee and cheesecake, eventually the evening had to come to a close. Walt and Muriel insisted on doing the dishes together. \u201cIt\u2019s what Muriel promised, since she\u2019d donate a kidney before she\u2019d actually consider cooking,\u201d Walt said.</p><p>And once they were alone in the kitchen, he came up behind her at the sink and kissed her neck. \u201cYou handled that whole interrogation beautifully. Classic recon\u2014evasion, resistance, escape. We could have used you in the army.\u201d</p><p>She turned in his arms. \u201cWhat I did for a living was much more dangerous. But I agree with you, I am good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s get this kitchen cleaned up so I can follow you home, spend a little time away from the kids.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can get into that idea,\u201d she said, grinning.</p><p>At the other end of the house, Tom led Brenda out the front door, pulled her into his arms, making her giggle. He covered her lips in a passionate kiss and against them asked, \u201cHow does it feel to be the pretty half of the darling couple?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t think about it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt reminds me, we only have two more days together before you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we better get alone. How about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, please. The sooner the better.\u201d</p><p>And in the family room, in front of the fireplace, Paul sat in a large leather chair with Vanessa on his lap. She ran her fingers around his ear and put little kisses on his temple. They could hear the general and Muriel laughing in the kitchen, the sound of Tom\u2019s little truck firing up in the driveway as he took his girlfriend away. \u201cHow\u2019s the countdown on the house?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working as fast as I can. I can\u2019t wait until we have our own place.\u201d He kissed her lightly on the lips. \u201cAs soon as I get a little caught up on the building, let\u2019s sneak up to Grants Pass and not tell anyone we\u2019re there.\u201d</p><p>She giggled. \u201cPaul, all we have to do is park the baby with your mother. No one will bother us if she has her hands full of little Matt. We can do whatever we want.\u201d</p> <p>He growled and nuzzled her neck. \u201cIs there any question in your mind about what I want?\u201d</p><p>She sighed, snuggling closer.</p><p>Outside the great room on the deck, hearing the laughter in the kitchen, the engine of the little truck, the smooching in front of the fire, Shelby looked up at the cool, early-fall sky. She tried to imagine her mother\u2019s face amidst the stars, the way she looked before she got sick\u2014so energetic, so pretty and full of good humor and sass. As she so often did, she transported her thoughts to her mom.</p><p>I wish you could have been at the table with us tonight; it was so fun. Everyone was laughing, poking fun, telling jokes, gossiping. They were all so loud. And seeing Walt with a woman\u2014it\u2019s so different than the way he was with Aunt Peg. More playful. He\u2019s happy, Mom, having fun like I never thought he could. And Muriel, for a famous person, she\u2019s so silly, so funny. And you should see Vanni and Paul together. There were times I worried so much about Vanni, after losing first her mom and then her young husband\u2014I was afraid she\u2019d never be truly happy again. Paul is such a blessing to her, to the whole family. And I know that Tom and Brenda think only about how difficult it\u2019s going to be for them to be apart, but just the way they look at each other... Ahhhh, it reminds me a little of all those chick flicks we watched together. Man oh man, there\u2019s so much love in the air around here. Really, I didn\u2019t think this little town could hold so much life, so much romance. I\u2019m so lucky to have this place, to be here with my family....</p><p>Sometimes, even with all these people around, I still miss you so much....</p><p>Sometimes I\u2019m still so lonely....</p><p>Do you think my turn will ever come? I wonder that all the time.</p><p>Mel Sheridan had worked with Doc Mullins for over two years and in that time had married Jack and produced two children. The job hadn\u2019t been easy, Doc being a cantankerous sort, but they had developed a close working relationship and a very special friendship. They didn\u2019t agree on all that much, but they understood each other quite well. She was all about following the legal statutes to the letter while he was more concerned with being sure his people, his town, got by as well as they could, regardless of little things like laws. Getting down to it\u2014Doc Mullins would risk anything to see his job was done, and done well.</p><p>Mel came to realize he\u2019d probably delivered most of the town; at least everyone under forty. He\u2019d been so much more than just a doctor here. He was the backbone of this town; their confessor, friend and healer. He didn\u2019t have any other family. Virgin River was his family.</p><p>And Mel and Doc, while neither of them was the least sentimental, had come to love each other. There was a grudging mutual respect\u2014he maintained he didn\u2019t need some uppity nurse to get the job done, while she chided that he was so stubborn and difficult he could make those asshole surgical residents she\u2019d worked with in Los Angeles look like a bunch of candy asses. It was true love.</p><p>He didn\u2019t see her as a daughter nor did she see him as a father figure, but he did regard her children as one might grandchildren. He never said as much, but the twinkle in his eyes when he picked one of them up was enough. And it filled her heart with pride and affection.</p><p>Mel was at the clinic first thing in the morning, leaning up against the kitchen sink sipping a cup of coffee, when he limped into the room. \u201cMorning,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cMorning, sunshine,\u201d she said with a grin. \u201cHow\u2019s the arthritis today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorst day of my goddamn life.\u201d He reached into the cupboard over the sink and grabbed a bottle of anti-inflammatory capsules, shaking a couple out.</p><p>\u201cWorse than yesterday, which was the worst day of your goddamn life?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He turned to look at her and lifted one white, bushy brow. \u201cYes,\u201d he said, swallowing the pills without water.</p><p>\u201cHmm, sorry then,\u201d she said. \u201cMust be awful. Say, listen\u2014I\u2019ve worked out a couple of things with Shelby. She\u2019s going to do some babysitting. She\u2019s a godsend, really. Brie\u2019s getting pretty pregnant and though she loves keeping the kids for me on Wednesdays, I think it\u2019s a good idea to spell her, let her contemplate her uterus and her own bundle of joy. Plus, Shelby loves hanging around here. So we\u2019ll let her help out here, watching kids, assisting in exams, learning the workings of a country clinic. She\u2019d get to see a side of medicine that\u2019s not limited to caring for someone who\u2019s terminal. She\u2019s so anxious to pitch in. How\u2019s that sound to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe babysitting will help you,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll ever have enough work here to ask her to pitch in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But she has time on her hands. And nursing is different than caregiving. I realize it\u2019s not the experience she\u2019ll get when she\u2019s finally in school, but it\u2019s something. You can always loosen up and tell her stories of country doctoring\u2014she\u2019d love that. And when I have patients, I\u2019ll have her with me. Plus, I enjoy her company. She\u2019s sweet and sharp. I think of her as kind of a prot\u00e9g\u00e9e. I\u2019ve never had one of those before. I\u2019ve always been one.\u201d She grinned at him.</p><p>\u201cMelinda, we\u2019re going to bore her to death,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou can always teach her to play gin. Maybe you can find a girl you can actually beat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I think about one more woman around here, it gives me heartburn,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be having so much heartburn, especially with your gallbladder gone. Maybe it\u2019s acid reflux. Are you having pain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAch,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m seventy-two with arthritis. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI think we should check it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBah,\u201d he scoffed. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m old, that\u2019s all. I\u2019ve been ridden hard and put up wet.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him. He hadn\u2019t changed much in her two years there. He was using his cane a great deal more these days\u2014the arthritis was wearing him down. He was an old seventy-two\u2014his life had not been an easy one. He\u2019d worked his way through college and medical school with no help from family and spent the next forty-five years caring for the needs of a town single-handedly, with only the most rudimentary equipment, and with no liability insurance. When she had lifted her eyebrows at that, shocked, he merely shrugged and said, \u201cWe don\u2019t sue each other here. At least not over medical aid.\u201d</p><p>Doc had never married, had no children, and had told Mel there was no extended family. Mel had a great deal of affection for him, even if he did ruffle her feathers from time to time. He had, indeed, been ridden hard.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s acid reflux, they have some really good stuff for that now,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI know this, Melinda. I\u2019m a doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd not just any doctor,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cThe biggest pain-in-the-ass doctor in three counties. Suit yourself.\u201d And then she thought of something. \u201cYou know, you could ask Preacher to come up with some meals that don\u2019t stir up that heartburn so much....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I do that? He\u2019s a dream in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve asked him for some low-fat meals. He was very agreeable, for Preacher. I\u2019ve put on some weight since I got here.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his glasses to his forehead and peered at her lower half. \u201cHmm,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou did not just do that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I say a word?\u201d he asked, letting his glasses drop into place. She hmmphed and crossed her arms over her chest, glaring at him. \u201cQuit complaining about your weight,\u201d he said, rubbing a hand over his big belly. \u201cAt least you have the advantage of giving birth to most of yours.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She lifted a mean little eyebrow. \u201cYou could give up that whiskey you have at the end of every day. That might help with the heartburn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMelinda,\u201d he said gravely, \u201cI\u2019d rather have needles in my eyes.\u201d</p><p>Four</p> <p>It didn\u2019t take Luke long to make enough adjustments so he could sleep in a real bed, in a real house, make use of a real shower. First, the exterminator plugged holes and placed traps. Luke did some serious clearing of trash and cleaning. Then there was a new mattress-and-box-spring set and a working refrigerator, both of which he could transport in his truck and move with a dolly. A couple of weeks made all the difference. But every day was long and dirty. His muscles ached. There was an endless amount of work to be done.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t yet five when he was showered and headed for a beer and some of that excellent food at Jack\u2019s. He\u2019d only been there a minute, waiting for someone to come from the back to serve him, when Mel struggled into the bar, baby against her chest, toddler in hand, diaper bag slung over her shoulder. Right inside the door, the toddler took a tumble down onto his knees and sent up a wail. \u201cOh, punkin,\u201d she said. She spied Luke and said, \u201cOh, Luke, here.\u201d She thrust the baby into his hands so she could stoop to lift up the boy. \u201cOh, you\u2019re okay,\u201d she said, brushing off his knees. \u201cDon\u2019t cry now, you didn\u2019t even break the floor. It\u2019s okay.\u201d She was just about to stand, when she heard her husband\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cMel,\u201d he said.</p><p>She looked up from the floor. Jack was behind the bar. He inclined his head toward Luke with a smile on his face. Luke was holding the baby out in front of him at arm\u2019s length, a startled expression on his face while Emma kicked her little legs and squirmed.</p><p>Mel burst out laughing, then covered her mouth. She rose and went to him, taking the baby. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Luke,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been such a long time since I\u2019ve been around a man who didn\u2019t know exactly what to do with a baby.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have much experience with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay\u2014my mistake.\u201d She couldn\u2019t help but laugh again. \u201cThe first day I met Jack, there was a newborn at the clinic and he scooped her up like an old pro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I was an old pro, Mel,\u201d Jack said, coming around to the front of the bar. \u201cFour sisters, eight nieces and one on the way,\u201d he told Luke.</p><p>\u201cProlific family,\u201d Luke observed. \u201cI don\u2019t know much about babies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re looking to learn babies, this is the place,\u201d Mel said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there are any virgins left in Virgin River. The birth rate around here is on the rise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe and babies\u2014incompatible. And I like it that way.\u201d</p> <p>Jack crouched in front of the bar. \u201cCome on, cowboy,\u201d he said, holding out his big hands to David. \u201cCome to Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDa!\u201d David cried, waving his chubby arms and toddling at high speed toward Jack.</p><p>Jack hoisted the boy up onto his hip and went back around the bar. \u201cWhat\u2019s your pleasure?\u201d he asked Luke.</p><p>\u201cCold draft?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotcha,\u201d he said, expertly drawing a beer one-handed. He put it on the bar. \u201cHow\u2019s the house look?\u201d</p><p>Luke picked up the beer, much happier holding that than a baby. \u201cLike a train wreck. A complete disaster. I should probably have just put a match to it.\u201d He took a long pull. \u201cBut, I have the trash out of the house and I\u2019ve cleaned it up enough to sleep and shower in there. I\u2019ve started clearing out the cabins. I\u2019m going to have to ask Paul for some advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may have already gathered Paul is a great guy to work with if you want to do a lot of it yourself. He can step in and get the things done that are outside your expertise. Wish I\u2019d had him around when I was working on the bar.\u201d</p><p>With precision timing, Paul came in for a beer, still dusty in his work clothes. Right behind him, old Doc Mullins limped in and joined the men at the bar, raising one finger to Jack to set him up a whiskey, and Jack immediately knew exactly what he wanted. A few neighbors arrived, taking tables. The bar had settled into a nice little family watering hole with everyone knowing their places, relaxing into an end-of-day libation before dinner.</p> <p>Paul inquired about the house and cabins and Luke said, \u201cI\u2019m going to ask you to take a look, but first I have to finish clearing the trash out of the cabins. I got a Dumpster from Eureka and hired an exterminator. If you saw them now, you\u2019d run for your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t scare easy,\u201d Paul said. \u201cBut you go for it. I\u2019m ready when you are.\u201d</p><p>Luke tried not to watch the door. He had told himself for two weeks he wasn\u2019t coming here to see her. He came to Jack\u2019s because the people and the atmosphere were just what he was looking for in a small, friendly country bar. The men were good-natured and helpful, the women impossibly beautiful. The fact that he kept imagining her in his mind atop that big horse, the braid standing out as she rode, well...that was just that guy thing. He couldn\u2019t help it.</p><p>Jack leaned on the bar and said in a low voice, \u201cSome of my boys are coming in a few weeks to catch a piece of hunting season.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack,\u201d Mel said from across the room. \u201cNot again!\u201d</p><p>He ignored her while Paul chuckled. \u201cShe thinks we torture the deer,\u201d Jack explained, his voice normal again. \u201cShe loves to see the boys, but hates that we hunt. Why don\u2019t you buy yourself a deer tag and license. Join us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan,\u201d Luke said.</p><p>\u201cLuke, I had high hopes for you,\u201d Mel shot across the room.</p><p>\u201cRun by the bank and make a withdrawal,\u201d Paul advised. \u201cThere will be poker.\u201d</p><p>Luke grinned. \u201cDeal me in.\u201d</p><p>An old woman with muddy rubber boots, wiry white hair and big black-framed glasses came into the bar and jumped onto a stool beside Doc. Jack said, \u201cLuke, meet Hope McCrea, town busybody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. McCrea,\u201d he said politely.</p><p>\u201cAnother jarhead?\u201d she asked Jack.</p><p>\u201cNo, Hope. We\u2019re letting some army in here, as long as there aren\u2019t too many of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do anything special?\u201d she asked him point-blank.</p><p>\u201cSpecial?\u201d Luke returned, tilting his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for a teacher and a preacher for the town,\u201d she answered. \u201cBad hours, low pay.\u201d She lifted her finger to Jack, who set up her drink. \u201cDream jobs.\u201d</p><p>He laughed at her. \u201cI sure can\u2019t fill either of those slots.\u201d</p><p>Then she came in. The girl. Luke gulped. He felt a shimmer all the way to his knees. She wore her hair unbound and he saw that it was full and springy, something a man could get his hands all tangled up in. He had a mental image of his large hands on her slim hips. She had a fresh face. Except for something shiny on her lips, she appeared to wear no makeup, but she didn\u2019t need any. When she saw him, she lowered her lashes briefly, but smiled. Demure. Vulnerable and in need of a strong man. Oh, crap.</p><p>Then stepping into the bar right behind Shelby was a tall, broad-shouldered, silver-haired man of about sixty. Not exactly Daddy, but close enough. It hit Luke in the pit of his stomach. He came instantly to his feet\u2014force of habit. He knew a general when he saw one\u2014in or out of uniform.</p><p>With one hand on Shelby\u2019s shoulder, Walt extended the other toward Luke. \u201cThis must be the new guy. Walt Booth. How you doing, son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir,\u201d Luke said, taking the hand. \u201cLuke Riordan. Pleasure to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt ease,\u201d he said with a quick smile. \u201cWelcome. Jack, how about a beer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d he said, fixing one right up.</p><p>Shelby gently tugged Paul out of the way so she could have the stool next to Luke, causing Paul to lift his eyebrows curiously. But Luke wasn\u2019t sitting. At least not until the general did. He hadn\u2019t been out of the army quite long enough to relax about things like rank. He did glance at her, however, and she smiled at him, her eyes glittering slightly, maybe enjoying his obvious tension around her uncle. What he noticed was how rich and sultry her hazel eyes were. And he thought, oh God, I have to get beyond this. There were fifty things about the stirring he felt every time he saw her that were all wrong. He didn\u2019t get into things like protective, high-ranking uncles and innocent young women who were clearly looking for true love.</p><p>Luke didn\u2019t fall in love. He\u2019d been in love once, when he was much, much younger, and it had left a hole in his heart big enough to drive a tank through. The experience left him a man who couldn\u2019t form attachments; he was a dabbler, a player, not the kind of man who settled down. He never stayed in one place, nor with one woman for long.</p><p>This young Shelby was so transparent, she left little doubt as to what she wanted. Needed. She\u2019d like to wrap her emotions around a man and tether him right up against her heart, breaking him in half. Then, in making his getaway, he\u2019d hurt her bad. Annihilate her. Leave her young, tender heart in shreds and spoil everything for the guy who might come along later to do right by her.</p><p>The general finally sat and made army small talk. They went over their various commands and combat tours, and all the while he spoke with the general, he could smell Shelby\u2019s sweet fragrance. It was swirling around his head, confusing him, addling his mind.</p><p>When Walt finally turned his attention to Doc and Hope, Luke felt Shelby\u2019s breath soft on his cheek as she leaned toward him and asked, \u201cHave you made much progress on the house and cabins?\u201d</p><p>He wanted to be hardened toward her, oblivious to her, even cruel and indifferent would work, but when he turned to look at her, his eyes warmed because she melted him into soup. \u201cAs much as possible. I have a place to live that\u2019s not on wheels. It\u2019s going to be a bigger job than I thought. What have you been doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been helping Mel with the kids while she works, sometimes helping her with patients. I ride, babysit Vanni and Paul\u2019s little one, keep an eye on Uncle Walt... Hardly anything, really. I should come over and help you haul trash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s miserable work. Way too dirty for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could just watch,\u201d she said, and smiled so prettily that his heart almost fell out of his chest.</p><p>\u201cIf you do that, Shelby, I won\u2019t get anything done. You\u2019re a distraction.\u201d</p><p>She looked completely surprised. \u201cHow nice of you to say that,\u201d she said. She briefly covered his hand atop the bar with hers, and a sizzle shot through him at her merest touch. Damn, he thought, I\u2019m in serious trouble. He wasn\u2019t sure what he feared most: never having more of her or repercussions from the general if he ever did. \u201cIsn\u2019t this the greatest place?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cVirgin River?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, that. But Jack\u2019s. This little piece of town. I love dropping in here and always seeing a friendly face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been here a few times over the past couple of weeks and haven\u2019t seen your friendly face,\u201d he said, then silently cursed himself. Don\u2019t push this, he warned himself.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cMy cousin Tom was home on leave. We came in a couple of times, but mostly it was all about family. Quite a crowd at my uncle\u2019s, with all of us and then Tom and his girlfriend. He\u2019s gone to West Point now, so I imagine I\u2019ll be around more often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you like Jack\u2019s,\u201d he observed.</p><p>\u201cI grew up in a small town on the coast\u2014way bigger than this, but still cozy. There was this old dive called the Sea Shack\u2014nets and shells on the walls, lots of locals, but also bikers and tourists. You could always count on some of the same people being there. You never had to worry that you\u2019d be alone.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhere?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cBodega Bay, south of here. While this is all redwoods, deer and bear, Bodega Bay is ocean, fishing boats, some rocky cliffs above the sea, whales and dolphins.\u201d</p><p>He leaned his head on his hand, being hypnotized slowly. Thoroughly. He imagined her on the beach; the bathing suit would be very, very small. \u201cIt sounds great,\u201d he said. \u201cIs that home for you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mother passed away last spring, left me the house and I sold it.\u201d</p><p>He was momentarily surprised. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThank you. So, I won\u2019t be staying in Virgin River\u2014I\u2019m going to college, finally. This is just a vacation. While I\u2019m hanging out here, I\u2019m also applying to schools.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long is this vacation?\u201d he asked in spite of himself.</p><p>\u201cA few months, probably. After the first of the year, I plan to take a couple trips\u2014I\u2019m surfing the Net, looking at package deals. Then decide on the college and go find an apartment, get a part-time job, take some classes to get back into the rhythm. But I\u2019m hanging around to see Tom again. He\u2019ll have leave over the holidays.\u201d</p> <p>Walt interrupted them by getting Luke\u2019s attention. \u201cWhat\u2019s this Jack says? You have a brother in Black Hawks, too? Is the whole family crazy?\u201d</p><p>Luke turned toward the general and hoped it didn\u2019t show in his eyes that he was over the edge in lust. \u201cLighten up, sir,\u201d he said. \u201cAt least it\u2019s not tanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoy, I happen to like tanks.\u201d</p><p>When Luke left the bar, he drove straight to Garberville, when what he really wanted was sleep. His body was bone tired, but his brain was working overtime. And there was one part of his anatomy that was a little too alert for its own good. He hadn\u2019t had a reaction like this in a long, long time and coincidentally, the last time had also been from a general\u2019s daughter. It was years ago, and he\u2019d been unusually smart\u2014he walked away and never looked back. She had been a prison sentence waiting to happen.</p><p>He was trying to drive the thoughts of that sweet young thing from his mind; he\u2019d like to stop the hot little darts from shooting through his body.</p><p>He had no trouble finding the local bar\u2014a little hole in the wall that actually made him feel overdressed and totally military with his close-cropped hair and pressed shirt. There were a lot of men in plaid or chambray shirts, long hair, ponytails, mustaches and beards. It looked packed; plenty of cars and big trucks parked around outside.</p> <p>The place was full at nine o\u2019clock. He made his way inside, finding a stool at a very crowded bar in a noisy room. He ordered a shot of whiskey and a beer. Time to settle everything down and stop thinking about the girl. By the time he\u2019d left Jack\u2019s he had started having visions of putting his hands on her and being shot by her uncle.</p><p>He threw back the shot and nursed the beer. Good move, Riordan, he lectured himself. Move to a new little town where the same dozen or so people meet at the same little watering hole a couple of nights a week and within twenty-four hours get the instant hots for the one woman to be avoided at all costs. But lust was a beast in him and he was impossibly attracted to her.</p><p>He understood very well that touching her wasn\u2019t the problem. They were all grown-ups, not teenagers. He could seduce Shelby, get her in his bed, enjoy her and be enjoyed by her, and there wouldn\u2019t be too much trouble. He got the impression the general and Paul actually liked him. What would come after would create trouble\u2014he would fail to get serious, move on, make her cry. He\u2019d get into her without falling in love when she was a young woman clearly designed for true love, for permanence. And that would have a bad ending\u2014with him it wasn\u2019t just a premonition, it was destiny. He hadn\u2019t been able to feel anything like what Walt Booth would want for his niece in over a dozen years.</p><p>After about twenty minutes passed, another beer was put in front of him and he looked up at the bartender. \u201cThe ladies across the bar,\u201d he said.</p><p>Luke hadn\u2019t even noticed anyone else. His mind had been on exactly one sweet thing. He glanced up and felt his lips lift in a slight smile. \u201cThank them,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019d like to know if you want to join them for a drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, I\u2019m going to have to leave pretty soon,\u201d he said. But he was thinking, that\u2019s more my speed. Some good old-fashioned, all-American, slutty girls, hanging out in the bar and buying drinks for strange men.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d think that over,\u201d the bartender said, lifting an eyebrow.</p> <p>\u201cYeah?\u201d He grinned. \u201cWhy not,\u201d he said. He put some money on the bar to pay for his drinks and, lifting the beer, walked to the other side.</p><p>There were three of them. One in each flavor\u2014a redhead, blonde and brunette. They seemed to be in their late twenties and headed for sloshed. \u201cLadies,\u201d he said. \u201cThanks for the beer. Having girls\u2019 night out?\u201d</p><p>Giggles all around. \u201cWell, not anymore,\u201d one of them said. They parted seats so he could have the middle stool.</p><p>\u201cYou ladies from town?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019re from Garberville,\u201d one of them said. \u201cHow about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just passing through,\u201d he lied. \u201cI have some property on the river. I thought about some hunting. Fishing.\u201d</p><p>They were named Luanne, Tiffany and Susie. They were secretaries and had been in the bar since happy hour, and there didn\u2019t seem to be a designated driver among them. Two were divorced and one, Luanne, claimed to have never married. They were wearing their out-to-be-seen bar clothes: short denim skirts to show off their long legs, heels, fitted tops that accentuated cleavages. They had high, perky boobs and fluffy hair. In spite of himself, he briefly considered how much sexier Shelby was in her jeans and boots, her white shirts with rolled-up sleeves and fresh face, leaving everything to the imagination.</p><p>He learned they\u2019d all grown up in the area, so he asked about their favorite nightspots. He admitted to being recently discharged from the army after flying helicopters for a long time, but avoided the topic of any kind of combat. These girls weren\u2019t that interested in international events and after he said he\u2019d been last stationed in Texas, they didn\u2019t push him for details. They wanted to know more expedient things: Was he married? Would he be here long?</p><p>Within ten minutes Luanne had her hand on his knee under the bar. He almost jumped in surprise. Then she slid it along the inside of his thigh and he grabbed her wrist. \u201cI\u2019d like to be able to stand up from the bar, Luanne,\u201d he said. And she thought that was very funny.</p><p>That\u2019s when he knew\u2014if he wanted to unload some tension, it wouldn\u2019t be hard to negotiate. Embarrassingly, it wasn\u2019t exactly a rare move for him. He briefly considered this alternative, but very briefly. He just couldn\u2019t get into the idea.</p><p>As if a pact had been arranged, the girlfriends, Tiffany and Susie, wandered off, ostensibly headed for the ladies\u2019 room, except Luke noticed they were sidetracked at other tables in the bar and didn\u2019t return. They were leaving Luke and Luanne alone to proceed. He tried carrying on a conversation with Luanne, who seemed only able to talk about her secretarial job, clothes and girlfriends. She had a very annoying hair-tossing habit. Every few seconds she flapped that fluffy mane over her shoulder.</p><p>He had to remove her hand from his thigh another time. He leaned toward her and whispered, \u201cListen, you don\u2019t want to get me stirred up. All right?\u201d</p><p>And, leaning far too close and brushing her cheek against his, she said, \u201cWhat if I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be a mistake. I\u2019m not exactly available.\u201d Then he wondered why the hell he said that. He was worse than available, he was verging on desperate.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t exactly care,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He was not in the best shape for this kind of horseplay. He excused himself and said he\u2019d be right back, leaving her at the bar. Whew, he thought, headed for the men\u2019s room. There was no safe place, he realized. He wasn\u2019t safe with Shelby, wasn\u2019t safe away from her. This Luanne was more his type\u2014she looked like lots of mindless sex with no attachments. One small problem\u2014she just didn\u2019t do it for him. And the more she came on to him, the less she appealed to him. The guilelessness of the general\u2019s niece had already spoiled him for a nice, uncomplicated one-night stand. He decided that rather than go back to the bar, he\u2019d slip out the back way.</p><p>He came out of the bathroom and found himself in an instant body slam against the wall in the narrow, dim hallway. Luanne had him pinned. \u201cWhoa,\u201d he said, hands up as though he was being arrested to keep from touching her.</p><p>She lifted her sultry, half-drunk eyes up to his face, smiled a lopsided smile and cleverly tucked something into the front pocket of his jeans. From his vantage point he was looking down at an impressive cleavage and two very healthy breasts pressed against him. It distracted him for a minute\u2014he loved breasts. He often thought that if God had given him breasts, he wouldn\u2019t be able to keep his hands off himself. He\u2019d be seen walking around town with his palms pressed over his own chest.</p><p>She had her arms around him in the dark hallway that led to the restrooms, pressing him against the wall. A man walked past them, glanced at them, smiled slightly and moved on. Luanne stood on her toes and pressed her lips against his. Holy shit, he thought, his groin beginning to tighten. With her arms around him, she pulled him around and into the ladies\u2019 room. He found himself pushed up against the sink while she flipped the lock on the door. She accomplished this with such deft skill, it was clear she\u2019d done it before.</p><p>Again, embarrassingly, it wasn\u2019t his first time for this, either. He couldn\u2019t remember ever being appalled, though. Last he could remember, this was about the time he\u2019d pull a condom out of his pocket and just go for it. It had been quite a while since he\u2019d been with a woman; it wouldn\u2019t take long. She was willing. She was past willing\u2014she was obnoxious. He slipped his hand down to his pocket to see what she\u2019d put in there. He pulled out something soft and lacy. A very tiny pair of panties. Red and black. And off. \u201cYou\u2019re fucking kidding me,\u201d he muttered, stuffing it back in his pocket.</p><p>\u201cDoes it look like I\u2019m kidding?\u201d she said sloppily.</p><p>He put a hand against her black hair. \u201cLuanne, this isn\u2019t going to happen. I\u2019m not doing this here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to go somewhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, baby. We\u2019re not going anywhere. I\u2019m not tapping this tonight,\u201d he said, giving her hip a little pat.</p><p>\u201cI bet I can change your mind.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNah. Not gonna happen. Want to let me out of the ladies\u2019 room, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? I don\u2019t usually get turned down.\u201d</p><p>Fantastic r\u00e9sum\u00e9, he thought. He felt a slight chuckle escape. \u201cTwenty reasons, kid. You\u2019re drunk, you\u2019re out of control, you don\u2019t know me and I don\u2019t know where you\u2019ve been. But I suspect\u2014lots of places.\u201d He put his hands on her upper arms and firmly but gently pushed her back. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t do this. You could get hurt.\u201d</p><p>He moved past her and unlocked the door. When he opened it there was a matronly woman waiting to get inside. He nodded. \u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d he said. He brushed past.</p><p>Luke moved, not slowly, to his truck, hoping to clear the parking lot before he found himself assaulted by a pantyless Luanne in the dark of night. Despite his better judgment, if she followed him, he was afraid he\u2019d have a momentary lapse and get under that short skirt. Hmm. He\u2019d never been afraid of something like that before. When he was on the road, he opened his window and let a little piece of red-and-black lace fly.</p><p>Then he stopped at a store on his way home to buy a six-pack of beer. He was going to have to avoid Jack\u2019s for a while. Until his brain disengaged from his nether parts. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dinner with the Booths had gone so well while Walt\u2019s son, Tom, was on leave, Muriel was invited back the next week. She had secret hopes it would be a regular event. It was lovely. Muriel pulled her truck up to her little bunkhouse after the next such dinner. She\u2019d left a light on for the dogs and could hear them barking before she even had her truck door closed. This is the family I come home to, she thought. Buff, only a few months old, had to be kept in the kennel when she was away from the house; he was still full of all that destructive puppy stuff and for Labs it was almost an art form. Luce was safe on her own now at almost two, but she spent most of that time right up against the kennel, watching over Buff.</p><p>She released the puppy from his kennel in the corner and got down on the floor to scratch and cuddle and play.</p><p>She had the most wonderful time with Walt and the kids. They were energizing. So full of life and laughter, despite the fact that each one of them had been through some incredibly tough times. Obviously Walt treasured his family, that was without question. They were fantastic fun. But did he know how remarkable they were? she wondered.</p> <p>They wanted to know how she got into movies. \u201cIt was a ridiculous accident,\u201d she had told them. \u201cI was about fourteen when I was chosen from my freshman class to appear in a public-service commercial. This agent appeared and talked my parents into letting me try out for a part in a movie. For a fourteen-year-old with virtually no experience or training, I lucked out and did well. Then there was a slightly larger part, then slightly larger, and I grew. By seventeen I was rushing through my senior year to finish all my classes ahead of time so I could be in another movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t your parents freak out?\u201d Vanessa asked.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have those kind of parents. They were amazed it was happening for me. I was making money and making film-industry waves\u2014Hollywood focus has always been on the new entrant, the incredibly young wannabe. But\u2014at twenty-one I married my agent, who was thirty-six. That almost sent my father to the moon. But he was a tough country rancher; he came around. Life was different back in these hills in my younger years. With common country folk, when a fifteen-year-old girl was keeping company with a guy over thirty, the girl\u2019s father got them married. Today\u2014he\u2019d have the guy arrested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you married to him long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive years,\u201d Muriel said. \u201cHe\u2019s still my agent of record. And friend.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut why didn\u2019t you stay married?\u201d Shelby asked.</p><p>Muriel shrugged. \u201cHe didn\u2019t really love me like I wanted to be loved. I wanted a home, a family, a life. Roots. He wanted an Oscar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive me for being completely uninformed,\u201d Vanessa said, \u201cbut did you get the Oscar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was nominated three times,\u201d she said. \u201cI was robbed.\u201d</p><p>And never got the family. Or the marriage that would have the kind of commitment and devotion that, even in the absence of children and Oscars, could have sustained her. After getting to know Walt\u2019s family, she thought that even if she\u2019d had the chance for a family, there was no way she could have produced such strong, independent, well-adjusted adults. Not in her line of work.</p><p>So she ruffled the ears and necks of her two Labs, cooing to them, kissing them, telling them she loved them.</p> <p>And then she heard an engine. A truck engine. The vehicle stopped, the door slammed and booted feet landed on the porch. All these sounds were familiar. There was a knock. Wasn\u2019t this unexpected.... \u201cCome on in, Walt.\u201d</p><p>He stood in the door frame in his suede jacket, jeans, hat. He looked at her on the floor with her pups and smiled. The dogs abandoned her to rush to him, weaving in and out of his long legs, Buff jumping on him. She\u2019d have to break him of that before it got out of control, she thought.</p><p>\u201cAny chance you brought more of that delicious dessert with you?\u201d she asked, getting up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAre you looking for coffee?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt would keep me up,\u201d he said, tossing his hat in the chair and reaching out a hand to pull her to her feet. \u201cCome here.\u201d He pulled her against him. He ran a hand down her cheek and along her jaw. \u201cWhere do the dogs sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the bed with me.\u201d She laughed, tilting her head up to him. She wondered if he knew how good-looking he was. And how solid; a man you could hold on to confidently. He didn\u2019t waver, not literally, not figuratively. She liked that in a man.</p><p>\u201cThink they\u2019d be okay on the floor one night?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou making that move, Walt?\u201d He kissed her in a way that should have sufficiently answered the question.</p><p>\u201cMuriel, I\u2019m sixty-two years old. I didn\u2019t see this coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you afraid of us becoming an item?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirl, I\u2019ve been dressed down by a president. You can\u2019t scare me with a little gossip. What worries me is that you\u2019ll find me old.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him. \u201cYou\u2019re just a few years older than I am. And you\u2019re almost irresistibly handsome.\u201d</p><p>One black brow shot up. \u201cYou find me handsome?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cAnd sexy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now. That so? Muriel, I want to touch every part of you. And then I want us to watch the sunrise together.\u201d The dogs were whirling around their legs, wagging, butting, trying to get someone to play. \u201cYou might have to do something about these animals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll settle down in a minute,\u201d she promised. \u201cBut don\u2019t you.\u201d</p><p>Five</p><p>On what had lately become a fairly typical afternoon, Shelby, Mel and Doc were having a game of gin at the kitchen table in the clinic while the babies napped. Doc wasn\u2019t doing much better against Shelby than he had over the last couple years playing Mel. These women were wiping him out. \u201cI think I\u2019ve gone through my retirement. You\u2019re ruthless females.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I remember you winning a couple of hands last week,\u201d Mel said.</p><p>\u201cBah,\u201d he said, struggling to his feet. He grabbed his cane and hobbled out of the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything I can do around here that would help you two more than being a third hand in a card game?\u201d Shelby asked. \u201cNeed someone to organize charts? Clean up a drug cabinet or treatment room? Inventory? Lab or supply run?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow is appointment day and I have three prenatals and four Pap smears. Since you\u2019re working here, you can assist. How does that sound?\u201d Mel asked.</p><p>\u201cLike a very slow day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe thing about country medicine is that it runs hot and cold,\u201d Mel said. \u201cThis town is so small that days, sometimes weeks, go by without anything exciting. Then everyone will pass around a virus and they\u2019re all hacking up a lung, and while they\u2019re doing that, everyone else is having an accident or going into labor. You have to be ready for everything, and nothing.\u201d</p><p>Shelby never tired of Mel\u2019s stories drawn from her nursing career, from the wild days of big-city emergency medicine, to the transition to small-town doctoring. For Shelby, working in a hectic urban E.R. sounded exciting, though she wondered if she\u2019d really enjoy living in a big city. But being a nurse in a town as little as this didn\u2019t seem to have enough jazz for her. More and more she thought she might end up in an emergency or operating room in a place like Santa Rosa\u2014something between big and small. Or perhaps Eureka or Redding.</p><p>\u201cHaving come from a big-city hospital, there was one thing about small-town medicine that took me by surprise,\u201d Mel said. \u201cIn no time at all, your patients are your friends. If there\u2019s some intervention you can\u2019t get to them in time, you feel not only that you\u2019ve failed a patient, but let down a friend. For example, hardly any of the women in this town had been having regular mammograms, and when I finally got a nonprofit foundation to bring a portable X-ray unit to Virgin River to examine the women over forty, one of my best friends was diagnosed with aggressive, advanced breast cancer. She died\u2014and I keep kicking myself for not getting the thing done sooner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must feel you can never do it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the contrary,\u201d Mel said. \u201cI feel I have to think of everything, and I must do it all. To many of these uninsured rural women, Doc and I are all they have. These Pap smears\u2014I\u2019ve cajoled almost every one of them. I call them, I push them, I get them in here and charge only lab costs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an easy thing to let slide, I guess,\u201d Shelby said.</p><p>\u201cBut you wouldn\u2019t let it slide,\u201d Mel said.</p><p>\u201cWell, that hasn\u2019t exactly been a priority the last few years,\u201d Shelby said with a laugh. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been meaning to talk to you about that....\u201d</p><p>Mel\u2019s back stiffened instantly. \u201cHow long might you have let that go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t had one,\u201d Shelby said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an extremely low risk,\u201d she said. Then she lowered her eyes. \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex.\u201d</p><p>Mel sat forward. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of unusual. At your age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t had a boyfriend. Oh, I dated a little in high school, but not seriously. I\u2019m the product of an accidental pregnancy and my mom raised me alone. If we hadn\u2019t been lucky enough to have Uncle Walt, life would have been a terrible struggle for us. My mom always felt so guilty about that, about taking all his help. I was scared to death of something like that happening to me. Mostly, I was afraid of disappointing my mom and my Uncle Walt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were very cautious....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes. And I was shy. And then I became nearly a recluse, taking care of my mom. The only men I came into contact with were married doctors, male nurses or hospice volunteers. And here I am, probably your first twenty-five-year-old virgin.\u201d She made a face. \u201cPlease, I really don\u2019t want the whole town to know I\u2019m a helpless, recovering introvert who lived with her mother for twenty-five years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShelby, you know everything in this clinic is confidential\u2014you took the oath when you decided to help out here. Besides, what you did for your mom gets nothing but admiration around here,\u201d Mel said. \u201cIt was very selfless. And if you don\u2019t mind me saying so, you seem quite sure of yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I got over a lot of that shyness while I was taking care of her. I had to be assertive to be sure she was getting what she needed medically. Once you learn to stand up to a highfalutin neurologist, you can handle the bag boy at the grocery store just fine. I\u2019m not crippled by shyness anymore, just a newcomer into the big, free world,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to be unprepared....\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t want the first thing inside you to be a speculum, but you should be examined. There are other concerns\u2014not just cervical cancer. There\u2019s uterine cancer, ovarian cancer. And then you should be protected. Ready. When that time comes, you shouldn\u2019t have too much to be worried about\u2014I can\u2019t imagine you still have a hymen with all that riding....\u201d</p><p>Shelby sighed. \u201cI wonder if it will ever happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll happen.\u201d Mel smiled. \u201cLet me ask you something\u2014how important is it to you that the first time be noticeably the first time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a big issue with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I can get you through an exam without changing the whole landscape too much.\u201d Mel took a breath. \u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d she asked squeamishly.</p><p>Mel nodded. \u201cGet naked. I\u2019ll meet you in the exam room. You know where the gowns are.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later Mel let herself into the exam room to find Shelby seated on the table. \u201cTake a deep breath,\u201d Mel said, smiling. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be fine.\u201d She helped to ease Shelby into the position, keeping a hand on each thigh so she wouldn\u2019t slide too far. \u201cThe good news is, I have really small hands.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank God for that, huh?\u201d</p><p>Mel chuckled and took her stool, snapping on the gloves. She selected a speculum, then selected a smaller one. \u201cEasy does it,\u201d she said, slipping it in. \u201cWell, here\u2019s a surprise. Hymen is still partially intact. After all that riding, I\u2019m amazed.\u201d She collected the Pap smear and removed the speculum. \u201cI was able to slip past it with the swab, but what\u2019s left of the hymen might be sacrificed when I palpate the uterus and check your ovaries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has to go sometime,\u201d Shelby said. \u201cI was sort of hoping to lose it the way the other girls do.\u201d</p> <p>Mel chuckled. \u201cThis is going to work out better for you. We\u2019ll get everything checked out and find you a dependable pill. No shocking surprises for you, Shelby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA twenty-five-year-old virgin. How often do you see that outside a convent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the first,\u201d Mel said, standing. She gently palpated the uterus. \u201cSince you don\u2019t have any symptoms or problems, I\u2019m not going to stretch my hand in there any farther today. Your periods are regular?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExtremely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo pain between periods?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all good, Shelby.\u201d She pulled off her gloves. \u201cI usually do the breast exam first, but under the circumstances I wanted to get the pelvic out of the way. Let\u2019s have a look,\u201d she said, pulling the gown to one side, then the other to gently examine her breasts for lumps.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you up on the birth control pills, even though I don\u2019t have any use for them at the moment,\u201d Shelby said.</p><p>It would be unethical for Mel to ask Shelby if she had someone in mind for that position. Another handicap of being a small-town practitioner\u2014seeing the hot little glances exchanged in a neighborhood bar. \u201cWell, I think it\u2019s healthy to have a sex life with a responsible partner,\u201d she finally said. \u201cI think it\u2019s unhealthy to have an unplanned pregnancy. Choose very carefully. Be prepared. Play it smart,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s one more thing. I probably don\u2019t have to lecture on this, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCondoms,\u201d Shelby said. She smiled and a flush reached her cheeks. \u201cI should probably have some of my own, in case...\u201d</p><p>Mel patted her hand. \u201cI love having beautiful, intelligent women for patients. Get dressed and I\u2019ll round you up some supplies.\u201d</p> <p>Shelby was leaving the clinic for the day when something caught her eye. She made a U-turn and went right back inside. \u201cMel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d Mel said, looking up from the computer. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there some old guy living in the boarded-up church?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome and look,\u201d Shelby said.</p><p>Mel walked out on the porch and looked across the street. Slumped in the doorway wearing a ragged coat, baggy men\u2019s pants and boots, Cheryl Chreighton. \u201cMy God...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Shelby asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I first got to town, I met Cheryl. She\u2019s an alcoholic and young, only about thirty years old. I was determined to find a way to get her into some kind of treatment, but she disappeared. We haven\u2019t seen her in about a year. I could have asked around more, but... Well, I didn\u2019t pursue her because she wasn\u2019t my patient. And I was pregnant, then pregnant, then...\u201d She sighed. Then had two babies and a hysterectomy, she thought. It was hard enough to keep up with the patients in her actual care. Cheryl might not be a patient, but still, a resident of the town. And Mel couldn\u2019t stand the idea of a thirty-year-old woman being the town drunk. It ate at her. She should get a second chance.</p><p>And she was back.</p><p>Luke stayed away from Jack\u2019s for a while; stayed away from Shelby. He hoped he\u2019d forget about her, but lust has a life of its own. He thought about her, then damned himself for being an idiot. But, nonetheless, she preoccupied his thoughts. And while she rested in a sweet place in his mind, he made progress on his house and cabins and drank his own beer.</p><p>The army delivered his household goods, things that had spent almost as much time in storage while he was in barracks or out of the country as in a home.</p><p>Luke had owned a duplex in El Paso, renting the other half to another G.I., which he sold upon discharge from the army. He didn\u2019t have a lot of furniture, which turned out to be a good thing, but what he had was quality stuff. He had decided to put his big, old-ash bedroom furniture in one of the upstairs rooms. He had a plush velour L-shaped sectional, an extra-large chair and an upholstered piece that doubled as a coffee table or bench\u2014a little something to put your feet up on. He kept a tray on the ottoman to rest a glass or cup on. He put everything in the living room and covered the furniture with sheets until the sanding, painting and staining could be completed.</p><p>There was a nice Pottery Barn dining set that was perfect in the dining area; a dark, square table and eight chairs\u2014a real good poker table. He could get matching bar stools, but he planned to rebuild the breakfast bar first. The kitchen looked a lot better with new appliances, but it would really shape up when the countertops and cupboards were replaced. He made a trip to Home Depot in Redding to place his order\u2014he could install everything himself. While he was there, he bought the stain, varnish and large area rugs for the hardwood floors.</p><p>Among his household goods were kitchenware, linens, stereo, large-screen TV for which he had a satellite dish on order, tons of tapes, DVDs, books, CDs. Not many clothes; he\u2019d been in uniform a long time. His closet had always been pretty lean and functional, which suited him fine.</p><p>He was ready to venture back to Jack\u2019s. There was a part of him that hoped she wouldn\u2019t be there so he could be at peace with his decision to stay away from her. Another part wanted her there, within reach, because the decision just didn\u2019t seem final.</p><p>She did something to him. At first he figured the attraction stemmed from being in this little town with so few options, but then he remembered Luanne and that bar in another town and realized it wasn\u2019t quite that. Even if Luanne hadn\u2019t appealed, it was very likely a more alluring woman would come along. Usually if he got the hots for a woman he shouldn\u2019t be around, it didn\u2019t exactly take an act of Congress for him to move on to someone who didn\u2019t jam him up so bad. Whatever it was about Shelby, he was having a damn hard time letting go of it.</p><p>But he just wasn\u2019t done with her. Not hardly.</p><p>Luke was just coming out of the shower at the end of a long workday when he happened to see a figure pass too closely to the house. The river was far enough away so that people walking, fishing or jogging there should not come so close. With a towel wrapped around his waist, he looked out the bedroom window. Nothing. He went through the living room to the kitchen and looked out the dining-room window. There was a large boy or man digging through his Dumpster. He was heavy and slightly humped. He\u2019d heard there were transients living in the forest. He could have yelled at him to get out of there, but what did it hurt, him digging through the trash? He wasn\u2019t making a mess or anything. Besides, with the threat of bears, he didn\u2019t leave food scraps out there.</p><p>The man turned and Luke nearly jumped back in surprise. He couldn\u2019t be sure of his age, but two things were glaringly obvious. He had Down syndrome. And a big, nasty black eye.</p><p>Luke stayed out of sight. He didn\u2019t want to frighten him.</p><p>An hour later he was leaving the house for an early-evening beer at Jack\u2019s and as he went down the driveway to the road, he saw the door to cabin six slowly swing closed. The farthest cabin from the house.</p><p>So. He had a tenant.</p><p>Luke had been putting in some real long, solitary days. Nothing was going to fix him up better than a cold beer and a little company. When he walked in, Jack welcomed him like an old friend. \u201cHey, man. Haven\u2019t seen much of you lately. How\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDirty and ugly.\u201d Luke grinned. \u201cBut I\u2019m making incredible progress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah. What\u2019s Preacher got cooking tonight?\u201d Luke asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got some venison stew going back there,\u201d Jack said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the best I\u2019ve ever tasted. You staying for dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have to now,\u201d Luke said.</p><p>By the time Luke was halfway through his beer, Paul walked in, still dirty in his work clothes. He looked down at one upturned boot and walked back outside. The banging that could be heard in the bar was Paul kicking the porch steps, knocking the dried mud off his boots. Then he was back, up on a stool beside Luke.</p><p>\u201cHow you doing, Luke?\u201d Paul asked.</p><p>\u201cPretty good. I was planning to give you a call. Can I get you to send someone out to look at a couple of things? I need to have a professional examine the roofing on the house and cabins and check wiring for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe glad to. In fact, I\u2019ll do it myself. Jack,\u201d he said, lifting a finger. A cold beer instantly appeared in front of him. \u201cHow\u2019s tomorrow afternoon? Say, around five, when I\u2019m wrapping it up out at the houses and we still have light?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d Luke glanced over his shoulder a couple of times. He hadn\u2019t seen her in too long. He hoped she\u2019d stay away, prayed she\u2019d be there soon. \u201cYou staying for dinner?\u201d he asked Paul.</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d he said, taking a deep drink. \u201cA beautiful redhead\u2019s cooking for me tonight. And if there\u2019s a God, the general has other plans.\u201d</p><p>The bar filled up, some neighbors, a few fishermen and a small gang of young hunters wandered in. Luke had a second beer, opting to wait on the stew a while, and then it happened. She finally came in. He had just about convinced himself he was going to escape temptation tonight. But no, it was going to be worse than usual. Tight jeans, silky blouse under a denim vest, all that hair unbound and flowing free, begging to be crumpled up in his hands.</p><p>She came right up to the bar. Paul dropped an arm around her shoulders immediately. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, kiddo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so much,\u201d she said. \u201cHey, Luke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, yourself,\u201d Luke said.</p><p>\u201cGetting any better out at your cabins?\u201d Shelby asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m heading home,\u201d Paul said, draining his beer. \u201cComing home for dinner?\u201d he asked Shelby.</p><p>\u201cUncle Walt\u2019s out for the evening,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I have dinner right here. Luke looks lonely,\u201d she said with an impish smile. \u201cI\u2019ll be home later.\u201d</p><p>Paul kissed her forehead and said, \u201cGod bless you. And God bless Muriel.\u201d And he was gone so fast it made Shelby laugh.</p><p>\u201cDo you think he could be any more obvious?\u201d she asked Luke.</p><p>\u201cMuriel?\u201d Luke asked.</p><p>\u201cA beautiful neighbor lady moved in, right across the pasture. Uncle Walt\u2019s been tied up a lot of evenings ever since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Luke asked, eyes widening slightly. The general was into a woman?</p><p>She leaned her elbow on the bar, her head against her hand. \u201cYou don\u2019t mind a little company, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I think I\u2019m going to have to shove off...\u201d</p><p>Then Jack was standing in front of them, obviously hearing that last comment. \u201cI thought you were staying for dinner? Beer, Shelby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said. When the beer was delivered and Jack gone again, she said, \u201cYou were going to stay till I got here? That\u2019s not very flattering.\u201d</p><p>A little embarrassed, he said, \u201cI guess I could manage dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t put yourself out,\u201d she said. \u201cI can find someone to have dinner with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, this\u2019ll work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t come here every night, so I thought maybe we just missed each other. But I asked Jack\u2014you haven\u2019t been around for a beer at all. A couple of weeks, I think....\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Eleven days, he thought miserably.</p><p>\u201cAnd you were going to make a break for it once I showed up. I hadn\u2019t even considered you were avoiding me. Do I make you nervous or something?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWhew,\u201d he answered, shaking his head. \u201cI haven\u2019t been out of the army long enough to get over that rank thing. Your uncle\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIsn\u2019t anywhere in sight,\u201d she said, cutting him off. \u201cIs it just my uncle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a pretty girl, Shelby,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you\u2019re just a girl. Puts me on edge, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell then, we\u2019re even,\u201d she said. He gave her a perplexed look and she said, \u201cYou\u2019re a good-looking guy, obviously been around a lot more than I have, and you\u2019re older. Scary.\u201d</p><p>He laughed at her candidness. \u201cThere you go\u2014like water on a grease fire. Let\u2019s play it safe, huh? Now tell me about your day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing to tell. Besides, this is interesting. I\u2019d like to know what\u2019s going on here. So, it\u2019s pretty much that I\u2019m a lot younger than you are. Or you just don\u2019t like me.\u201d And then she blushed, which made him squirm. It obviously took guts for her to push on this issue. But she wanted to know. So he decided to tell her.</p> <p>\u201cYou know what it is, Shelby,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re young and tender. A sweet young thing. I\u2019m hell on sweet young things.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him. \u201cI bet anything you usually find a way to get past all that.\u201d</p><p>Well, she didn\u2019t scare easy, Luke realized with some admiration. And here was what had him screwed up\u2014it wasn\u2019t just that he had taken one look at her and felt that familiar tug of lust. Sounded like maybe the same thing had happened to her. Except that she had feelings deep enough to fall into and drown, and his feelings were all superficial, physical. Once his lust had been satisfied, he wouldn\u2019t have much left for her. She\u2019d end up sorry. He had always been able to avoid things like this, but this one, she was real tough on the nerves. It was going to be torture, just holding back. And it could be suicide, giving up the fight.</p><p>\u201cI just wish your Uncle Walt was a retired master sergeant,\u201d he said.</p><p>Luke usually confined his prowling to a town or two over so when the affair had run its course, he didn\u2019t keep bumping into the woman again and again. Or her uncle. Before crawling between the sheets, he\u2019d always give them \u201cthe talk\u201d: he didn\u2019t fall in love; wasn\u2019t interested in long-term deals or commitment. He had his reasons, serious and personal reasons, for believing that a serious relationship wasn\u2019t possible for him.</p><p>He wondered how Shelby would take to \u201cthe talk.\u201d Given her age, she would probably cry.</p> <p>He had been attempting to give not touching her a try, but just sitting next to her, having a beer, smelling her sweet scent and looking into those large hazel eyes, it was increasingly apparent he was destined to fail. It was just a matter of time; maybe a matter of hours.</p><p>\u201cWell, I admit, you\u2019re not exactly what I have in mind, either. I was thinking around twenty-six, more hair, polo shirt, or maybe a sharp, crisp, white button-down,\u201d she said, and then she grinned at him.</p><p>He was totally shocked. He\u2019d spent all this time fighting the attraction and she had something else in mind anyway? \u201cI\u2019m too old for you, plain and simple,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>\u201cProbably, but there don\u2019t seem to be many single men around. You kind of stand out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should throw your net wider,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cUntil I do, let\u2019s not get ridiculous. It\u2019s a beer and some dinner. It doesn\u2019t really matter how old we are or who my uncle is.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. Sometimes she seemed a little older than twenty-five. She was awfully bright. Quick. Usually the problem with girls her age was they were dimwits. Not this one. She was honest and direct. Luke respected that. \u201cYou\u2019ve been riding,\u201d he said. \u201cYour cheeks are sunburned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery day. Sometimes twice a day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow long have you been riding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince I was real young. I\u2019m Uncle Walt\u2019s only sister\u2019s only child, and my parents were divorced when I was just a baby, so my uncle kind of took me under his wing. He taught me\u2014he thought it would build my confidence to learn to handle big animals. It turned out I only got more confident around big animals.\u201d She shrugged and looked down. \u201cI used to be real timid.\u201d</p><p>The memory of seeing her on that big American paint came to mind. \u201cYou\u2019re sure not timid on that horse,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not so timid with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019ve worked through a lot of that. I don\u2019t know very much about you besides that you flew helicopters in the army. What about your family? All I know is you have a brother in Black Hawks in the Middle East.\u201d</p><p>Luke\u2019s dad had been a hardworking teamster, an electrician, and while he was a good provider, there hadn\u2019t been a great deal left over for things like college educations. There were five boys to raise and educate. \u201cI was the oldest and first one in. It wasn\u2019t a hard decision for me\u2014I always liked the idea of the army. It was a place for me to show my stuff\u2014and I did fine. Loved the challenge. Colin followed me\u2014into the army out of high school, into Warrant Officer School and the Black Hawks. Aiden upped it a notch\u2014went into college ROTC and got a navy scholarship for med school. Don\u2019t ask me how\u2014but Sean scored an Air Force Academy slot and got into the U-2. Sean is the brother who went in on the cabins with me. Paddy\u2014Patrick\u2014got into the Naval Academy and F-18.\u201d He smiled because her mouth had dropped open.</p><p>\u201cHoly crap, there are five of you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. He thought he was going to have to sit on his hand to keep from touching her hair. \u201cProlific Irish family. Sean and Patrick and their jets\u2014they think faster is cooler. But they think that because they\u2019ve never been in the Black Hawks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFaster, higher and maybe safer,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cPossibly.\u201d He laughed.</p><p>\u201cHow many times have you crashed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never crashed,\u201d he said, straightening proudly. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been a damn good target three times. Mogadishu, Afghanistan and Iraq. I\u2019m all done getting shot out of the sky. Right now, I want my most dangerous experience to be hammer versus thumb.\u201d</p><p>They talked about building for a while, about the plans he had for the cabins. He would concentrate on the exteriors while the weather was still nice and when it cooled off and the Pacific winds brought the wet and cold, he could work inside. \u201cChapman left the house a wreck, but the structure seems sound. It\u2019s going to take some doing to get it right. It\u2019s small, but big enough for me. And if a brother or two shows up, there\u2019s room. But this is temporary for me. By the time the work is done, I\u2019ll be looking for a flying job\u2014rescue or news chopper, or maybe even private industry. But chopper jobs are pretty tight, so it\u2019s good I have something to keep me busy while I check out the job market.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere will you go?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m flexible,\u201d he said with a shrug.</p><p>She learned the brothers were close\u2014when they were in the same part of the world, they got together. His father was deceased, but his mother was in Phoenix and they met there regularly. And each of them was willing to travel if there was a chance to meet. When she asked if he had a lot of nieces and nephews, he said, \u201cAll single. No kids anywhere.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t tell him a whole lot about herself, just that she was finally ready to get on with her education, that she would be applying for degree programs. \u201cI have my tuition money set aside from the house sale. I\u2019d like to take a couple of trips first, maybe a cruise, since I can\u2019t get back to full-time school till next fall anyway. I\u2019m pretty nervous about that, it\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve been a student.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll kick ass,\u201d he said, taking curious pride in her ambition.</p><p>\u201cFor now, I\u2019m just hanging out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor how long?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She answered with a shrug. \u201cTill the first of the year, anyway, that\u2019s the plan. There\u2019s not too much for me to do except help everyone out, and I\u2019m already getting a little bored.\u201d</p><p>He made her laugh, put her at ease. She had a second beer and he had another. \u201cYou about ready for some dinner?\u201d he finally asked her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starving,\u201d she said.</p><p>By the time Jack put stew in front of them, many of the locals were leaving, but there were still a few fishermen, so there was no hurry for Luke and Shelby to clear out.</p><p>They asked Jack for coffee and talked for another hour before Shelby looked at her watch and said, \u201cDo you think I\u2019ve given the lovebirds enough time alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the look on Paul\u2019s face, there isn\u2019t enough time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it.\u201d She stood up and slipped a hand into her jeans\u2019 pocket.</p><p>\u201cNah, Shelby. Let me,\u201d Luke said. He pulled out his wallet and put some bills on the bar.</p><p>\u201cCareful, Luke,\u201d she teased. \u201cIf you buy my dinner, I\u2019ll think you like me.\u201d</p><p>He put a hand on the small of her back. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem,\u201d he said. \u201cI do.\u201d He was past the jitters about her age, her uncle. He was moving on this. And when it was over, he was going to be shot, he was pretty sure. But he was into her; she had him. He hoped his death would be quick and painless.</p><p>An excited shiver ran through her as she preceded him out the door. When she got outside, she stopped on the porch and looked up at the clear, cool sky, peppered with a million stars. The wind through the pines made a whirring sound; an owl occasionally hooted.</p><p>Luke moved behind her and, with his arms around her waist, drew her back against him. She let her eyes softly close, enjoying the feeling of his sturdy body so close to hers. He nuzzled her hair and despite the noise of the wind through the pines, she heard his breath as he inhaled. Then she felt him move her hair aside; his lips and tongue were on her neck. \u201cHmm,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s nice. Real nice.\u201d Then she felt him sucking and she tilted her head to one side to give him more of her neck.</p><p>That tilt of the head, that was more invitation than Luke usually required. He pulled her away from the bar\u2019s front door to the edge of the porch, to a dark corner. He\u2019d begun feeling light-headed just from the sensation of her neck against his lips. Her soft, sweet fragrance swirled around him and he wanted to take her somewhere, undress her, taste the rest of her body.</p><p>He faced her and looked down into her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sure this is a huge mistake,\u201d he said in a throaty whisper.</p><p>She rubbed her hands up and down his upper arms and just smiled that soft, sweet, beguiling smile.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pretty irresistible, Shelby. And I never did have much willpower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m kind of new at this flirting with dangerous older men,\u201d she said. \u201cIs this where I apologize?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew at it?\u201d he asked. \u201cI think you might be a natural. It\u2019s working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe I have more social skills than I thought,\u201d she said with a laugh. There was no maybe about it\u2014she had made a sudden and crazy decision. She wasn\u2019t going to wait for the younger, more stylish man. The very thing he was warning her to be careful about, she decided, would work to her advantage. He was experienced. He knew what he was doing. She needed that. His arms around her and his lips on her neck felt wonderful. He would do nicely.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what it means to get mixed up with someone like me?\u201d he asked, his voice husky.</p><p>\u201cDanger? Heartbreak?\u201d She took a breath. \u201cAdventure? You don\u2019t scare me as much as I scare you, Luke.\u201d</p><p>He slowly lowered his lips to hover over hers. \u201cYou sure about this?\u201d he asked. \u201cBecause I think you know where all this flirting is headed. I\u2019m no kid. This is headed someplace real naked.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t get ahead of yourself,\u201d she said with a weak whisper. \u201cI\u2019m not taking my clothes off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet?\u201d he asked, his lips so close to hers she could feel his breath in her mouth, warm and sexy.</p><p>\u201cMaybe never,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he whispered back. \u201cI like that word, maybe.\u201d Then he lowered his lips to hers and pressed against them softly. He ran his hands up her sides, catching her under the arms and stretching them out, bringing them around his neck, showing her how to hold him. His arms went around her waist and he pulled her against him, kissing her more deeply. He could feel her firm breasts against his chest and he\u2019d like nothing so much as to lower his lips to one, but this was not a woman to ravage. This was a woman to lead. Besides, Jack\u2019s front porch was not the place. For the things he wanted to do, they needed to be assured of more privacy. He opened his lips, sucking at hers. And she opened hers, letting her tongue make a gentle, silken swipe of his mouth, bringing a deep and passionate groan from him. He ran a hand down over her bum and pulled her hard against him. He was already aroused; she just knocked him out.</p><p>Something like a whimper came from her as she pressed herself against him, opening her lips more to admit his tongue. His kiss was hot, wet, deep and long. He had been right about one thing\u2014she could mold her small body against him in a way that made him think he might go completely crazy. The one thing that helped him keep his sanity was the belief that when this was finally consummated, it was going to be sweet. And good. For both of them.</p><p>\u201cI have a feeling I\u2019m not what you were expecting,\u201d she whispered against his lips. \u201cI\u2019m not very experienced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already know that,\u201d he said. \u201cI am.\u201d He kissed her again, holding her tight, and he felt a slight trembling in his arms. He pulled away from her lips, still holding her small bottom and pushing her hips against him, and whispered, \u201cYou\u2019re right, Shelby. You\u2019re pretty much all surprises.\u201d</p><p>She expelled a small huff of air, smiled and said, \u201cYou have no idea.\u201d</p> <p>He ran a hand along the hair at her temple. \u201cShelby, how does a young woman as beautiful and sweet as you not have a man in her life?\u201d</p><p>She glanced down briefly. \u201cThere was no time for that. My mom... She was completely dependent on me.\u201d She looked up into his eyes. \u201cI took care of her. That was my full-time job. Until she died.\u201d</p><p>He was stunned speechless for a moment. \u201cFor how long?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>\u201cFive years or so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Shelby...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was my choice. It\u2019s what I wanted.\u201d</p> <p>He leaned toward her and pressed his lips tenderly against her head. \u201cNot many people would do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, probably more than you think.\u201d</p><p>He was surprised at how much that moved him, touched him. He lifted her chin with a finger and brushed his lips across hers again. He threaded his hand under her thick mane of hair at the back of her neck and put soft kisses on her mouth and temples and eyes. Then her lips again. And he said, \u201cNo. Only a certain kind of person takes on something like that. Your kind of person.\u201d This young woman was every beautiful thing he\u2019d ever imagined, from her body to her spirit. He gave her lips another light kiss. \u201cI\u2019m going to put you in your car now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems like maybe you changed your mind about this...this flirting....\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. He wished he could. He knew he should. But he hadn\u2019t. When the time was right for her and the tension gave way to need, when there was no more maybe about it, she was going to come to him, soft and willing, and he was going to make long, slow, fabulous love to her\u2014damn the consequences. And he would be sure she\u2019d have no regrets about the experience. It wouldn\u2019t be too fast and it wouldn\u2019t be too soon\u2014and it would be exquisite. It wasn\u2019t a good idea, but it was the only idea he had.</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a one-track mind.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him. \u201cBig surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore this goes any further, we\u2019re going to talk about some things,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExpectations. Needs. You have to know what you could be getting yourself into. While there\u2019s still time for you to come to your senses.\u201d</p><p>She put her hand against his cheek. \u201cI look forward to that.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a brief kiss and said, \u201cCome on. Time for you to go home.\u201d</p><p>Six</p><p>Shelby wasn\u2019t quite ready to leave Luke; she was in the mood for more of that kissing and touching. But, sensing he was right to put a little space between them if she wasn\u2019t ready to go further, she let him put her in her Jeep and went home. She let herself into Walt\u2019s house and found it dimmed and quiet. A light was left on for her in the great room and Uncle Walt\u2019s big Tahoe was missing from the driveway. It was only ten, but there was no doubt in her mind that Vanni and Paul had turned in the minute the baby was asleep.</p><p>She was too stirred up for sleep. She pulled off her boots, built a fire, pulled the throw from the couch around her shoulders and curled up in the big leather chair near the hearth. She hugged herself dreamily.</p><p>Only about fifteen minutes had passed when Vanni came out of her bedroom wearing her robe and furry slippers. She smiled at Shelby, then went to the other chair facing the hearth, kicked off her slippers and pulled up her bare feet, tucking the robe around her legs.</p><p>\u201cDid I wake you?\u201d Shelby asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t asleep.\u201d</p><p>Shelby laughed conspiratorially. \u201cDid I disturb you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. In fact, I was thinking about you, wondering when you\u2019d get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you staying awake for me? To be sure I get in safely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Vanni said. Then she laughed and said, \u201cYes. Paul said you stayed at the bar to have dinner with Luke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And not only did Paul come home and report on me, every person there glanced at us as they left Jack\u2019s. Good thing I\u2019m not trying to get away with anything, huh? Good thing I\u2019m not fifteen, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think maybe Luke\u2019s a little too old for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is. And he\u2019s made it real clear that I\u2019m too young for him.\u201d Then she laughed softly. \u201cOh brother, he doesn\u2019t know the half of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I grew up around soldiers. Honey, they have some real rough edges. It\u2019s the nature of the beast. The life they lead, the things they\u2019re required to do, it puts them on the tough side of life. They harden up, you know? They can become insensitive, brash and... Well, they learn how to live in the moment, without looking back, if you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you say that about Uncle Walt? Jack or Paul?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThey\u2019re pretty special men.\u201d She was quiet for a moment and then said, \u201cYou\u2019ve been locked in with your mom for so long, you practically missed the real beginning of young womanhood. And now when you could really use a mom to talk to, she\u2019s gone. Maybe you and I should go over a few things. About men. About relationships.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Vanni\u2014you\u2019re worried about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it. I know how old you are. But I also know how inexperienced you are.\u201d</p><p>But he\u2019s experienced enough for both of us, she almost said. \u201cYou know, you can\u2019t have the kind of talk with me as you would with a thirteen-or sixteen-year-old girl. True, I haven\u2019t been around, but I\u2019m not ignorant. While I was housebound, postponing my life, I still had books and television. I might not have experienced much firsthand, but I\u2019ve been watching from the sidelines. I\u2019ve witnessed women\u2019s romantic problems from Scarlett O\u2019Hara to Anna Karenina. And that\u2019s not even taking into account prime-time TV. But you go ahead, Vanni,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cAnything you think I should know\u2014lay it on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like him,\u201d Vanni said.</p><p>\u201cI do. I didn\u2019t expect to, but I just can\u2019t help it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you know exactly what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cNo. I know what I\u2019d like to do, but I\u2019m such a clumsy novice, it\u2019s amazing he\u2019s not bored to death by me. I\u2019m a twenty-five-year-old going through puberty. When I was supposed to be learning these things in high school, I was too shy. I was afraid to flirt, afraid the boys would laugh at me. I could have learned a little later, when I was older and braver, but I was busy.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cSo here I am. Trying this out for the first time. With a guy whose first time probably came before I was born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to be hurt,\u201d Vanni whispered. \u201cYou\u2019re the sweetest, kindest person I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanni, I barely know Luke Riordan, but it\u2019s real clear he\u2019s not my knight in shining armor. He\u2019s done everything he can think of to discourage me, but let\u2019s be honest\u2014this was no frontal attack from him. He admitted he\u2019s avoided me because of my age. The coward.\u201d</p><p>Vanni laughed at her.</p><p>\u201cWhen you get down to it, my first choice was a completely different kind of man. Closer to my age, less seasoned, someone who doesn\u2019t come right out and promise to ravage you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Vanni sat up straight, eyes very large. \u201cHe said that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in so many words, but I got the message.\u201d A wonderful shiver passed through her. \u201cBesides, even if I found myself attracted to a younger man, he\u2019d still be more experienced than me, he might even be divorced with kids. There are a couple of things I know about Luke, though. He might be a little on the rugged side, but he\u2019s actually very tender. Gentle. Patient.\u201d Her eyes glistened when she looked at her cousin. \u201cHe kissed me,\u201d she whispered secretively. \u201cI\u2019ve never been kissed like that. It was unbelievable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhew. Really?\u201d</p><p>Shelby nodded. \u201cYou just can\u2019t imagine how good he is at it. Shew. But don\u2019t worry\u2014I told him I wasn\u2019t taking my clothes off. I wanted to, though. Boy, did I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShelby!\u201d Vanni said, stunned.</p><p>\u201cWell, I did, but the porch at Jack\u2019s bar didn\u2019t seem the place. Plus, it\u2019s pretty cold. I mean, I wasn\u2019t cold\u2014Luke was wrapped around me like a straitjacket.\u201d</p><p>Vanni giggled in spite of herself.</p><p>\u201cAnd he likes me. He hates that he likes me\u2014Uncle Walt has him scared to death. And you know what? I love that in spite of that he can\u2019t resist. Do you have any idea what that means to someone like me?\u201d</p><p>Vanni was quiet for a long moment. Finally, she said, \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have that talk. It would be nice to have someone to talk to about this. About where it\u2019s going, which I think I\u2019m pretty clear about. Can you do that without telling Paul all my personal business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Vanni said with a smile. \u201cMen don\u2019t care about these things anyway. Where should we start?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we start with you telling me about your first experiences with this,\u201d Shelby suggested.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Vanni said, looking into her lap for a second. \u201cFirst of all\u2014I wasn\u2019t shy in high school. Or in college. Or while I worked with the airline....\u201d</p><p>Shelby giggled. \u201cOh God, this is going to be delicious! I can\u2019t wait!\u201d</p><p>Luke was up early the next morning, as was usual for him. But this morning he had a mission in cabin six. He got out the bread, mayonnaise and mustard, bologna and cheese and made a half-dozen sandwiches. He wrapped them, put them in a sack and grabbed a big bag of chips and two canned sodas. The sun was just coming up when he pushed open the cabin door.</p><p>The man was curled up on a broken-down sofa in the corner in a big, chubby ball, sleeping, his jacket spread over his body. He rested his head on an arm. Luke crouched down beside him, but the guy didn\u2019t move a muscle. He was pretty filthy; Luke wondered how long he\u2019d been homeless. He gave his shoulder a little shake and the man\u2019s small eyes opened slowly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He rolled slightly, rubbed his eyes and scrambled into a sitting position.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been sleeping in here?\u201d Luke asked.</p><p>He shrugged. He yawned. \u201cA couple nights,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI brought you something to eat,\u201d Luke said, handing him the bag.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any more money,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s free. It\u2019s from my kitchen and I\u2019m sharing with you. What\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cArt,\u201d he said, opening the bag and digging out a sandwich. He nearly stuffed the whole thing into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cSlow down,\u201d Luke said and laughed. \u201cWho hit you, buddy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe din\u2019t mean it,\u201d he said, chewing and gulping. \u201cHe said he din\u2019t mean it.\u201d</p><p>The guy was starving. \u201cWho didn\u2019t mean it?\u201d Luke asked.</p><p>\u201cStan,\u201d he said. He made a final gulp and reached into the bag for another. \u201cMy boss at the grocery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Where are you from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEureka,\u201d he said, unwrapping another sandwich. \u201cI came through the big trees. I like \u2019em. The big trees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe redwoods. You walked all that way?\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged and swallowed. \u201cI hitched some. You\u2019re not supposed to hitch, you know. Then I walked through the big trees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThrough the grove, huh?\u201d Luke said. \u201cYeah, they\u2019re nice. How old are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirty. My birthday is in November. Then I\u2019m thirty.\u201d He dived into another sandwich.</p><p>\u201cYour parents live in Eureka?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cMy mom\u2019s gone now. I have a group home, but if I stay there I have to work at the grocery. For Stan.\u201d</p><p>Luke was still crouched, sitting on the heel of his boot. He\u2019d only known one kid with Down\u2019s while growing up\u2014a neighbor kid. He\u2019d been younger\u2014his brother Sean\u2019s age\u2014and Luke and his brothers all looked out for him. No one dared give him any trouble\u2014they\u2019d have to answer to the scrappy Irish Riordan boys. He was the sweetest kid on earth; Luke had learned they had a reputation for being the gentlest-natured people alive. But this guy\u2019s boss had slugged him in the face. Now, why would a person do something like that? So Art is on the run from an abuser. Wouldn\u2019t his caretaker be onto that? Make that right? Unless the caretaker was also abusive...</p><p>Luke thought about calling someone, get this guy some help. But he only thought about it for five seconds. He couldn\u2019t have some agency toss this guy back into a group home where he was mistreated. \u201cYou need a job where nobody hits, buddy?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged and chewed.</p> <p>\u201cI could use some help. Maybe if I let you have a place to sleep while I\u2019m working around here, you could do some chores for food and clothes and stuff. Any interest in that?\u201d Art nodded without making eye contact. \u201cCan you count?\u201d</p><p>Art looked up, swallowed and said, \u201c\u2019Course I can count. I\u2019m not stupid.\u201d</p><p>That made Luke smile. \u201c\u2019Course you\u2019re not. Okay. I can let you sleep in the trailer a few nights till we get a cabin straight for you. There\u2019s some plumbing that works in the trailer. I\u2019ll find you a sleeping bag and something clean to wear. How\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>He gulped down the last of his sandwich. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke,\u201d he said, standing up.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Luke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re done eating there, go down to the camper and wash up. The water\u2019s not real hot, but I\u2019ll get you a bar of soap and a couple of towels. I\u2019ll meet you down there in a little while, how\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Luke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a roof and a bed. We\u2019ll get a cabin in shape for you so you have a little more room, but the trailer\u2019s not so bad. It\u2019s better than this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Luke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Art.\u201d</p><p>Luke went back to the house and dug around in his things. Luke was a big guy, but his waist was trim, so nothing of his would fit Art. He finally settled on a bathrobe he never wore, and with towels, soap, pillows and a sleeping bag, he went back down to number six. It was empty. He hoped Art hadn\u2019t panicked and run, because the guy needed a little assist.</p><p>But Art had gone, as he was told, to the trailer. The shower, barely warm and tiny as hell, was running. Luke knocked on the door. \u201cArt? Hey, Art?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I hand you over some soap? Leave you a bathrobe and some towels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t. You put on this bathrobe and I think I\u2019ll wash these clothes for you. They\u2019re nasty, Art.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re dirty,\u201d Art corrected.</p><p>They were way past dirty. Luke handed a bar of soap into the shower and left the towels and robe hanging on the hooks right outside. Then he gingerly plucked the clothes off the floor and, leaving the shoes, carried them to his house. But before he entered, he changed his mind. They were so awful and probably infested, he didn\u2019t even want them in his washing machine. They were also threadbare, the underwear gray...yet the bruise was new. Suddenly Luke realized this was how Art had been dressed in the group home. So, Luke dug around in his toolbox for a tape measure and went back to the trailer. He walked in to find Art in his blue terry robe. Art jumped in surprise.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Luke said. \u201cI looked at your clothes and they seem to be in bad shape. I don\u2019t have anything that will fit you, but since you\u2019re going to work for me, I\u2019m going to buy something in your size. Any chance you know your size?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s forty, Art?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cOkay, no problem. Let me measure your waist. I bet it\u2019s your waist. But I\u2019ll need\u2014\u201d He stopped. He couldn\u2019t measure the man\u2019s inseam. Art had asked not to be looked at and Luke had a momentary concern that maybe something uncomfortable, if not horrible, had happened to him. He\u2019d measure the inseam of the discarded pants. That would do.</p><p>Art stood still for him while he put the tape measure around his waist. Forty\u2014the guy was fairly competent. Time would tell how competent, but Luke had made his decision. He was going to give him a chance to not be homeless or beaten. He\u2019d work out the details later.</p><p>\u201cWhat size are your shoes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen,\u201d Art said. \u201cWide. Very wide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Here\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do. I\u2019m going to get you some clothes because yours are ruined. Then I\u2019m going to make sure you have dinner. And tomorrow we can talk about your chores. Can you stay here, inside, until I get back? It\u2019ll be more than an hour.\u201d</p><p>He looked at the rolled-up sleeping bag on the bed in the trailer. \u201cCan I open that? It\u2019s okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Have a nap if you want to.\u201d Luke smiled at him. \u201cYou look good all cleaned up. How long you been on the road, buddy?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. But it couldn\u2019t have been too long\u2014the bruise was still fresh. He must have had some rough experiences in a short time to get so filthy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back. Stay inside. I don\u2019t want you scaring anybody in your bathrobe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your bathrobe,\u201d Art said. He was clearly very literal.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m giving it to you, pal. I never once put it on. I think my mother gave it to me. I think she gives me one every Christmas. Maybe she\u2019s trying to keep me from walking around naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother\u2019s gone now.\u201d</p><p>Luke reached out and squeezed his upper arm. \u201cYeah, you told me that. I\u2019m sorry, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a group home. But I don\u2019t want to have that job anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand, Art. You don\u2019t have to do that job. No one on this job will hit you. You clear on that?\u201d</p><p>He smiled a small smile. A small, tired, hungry, beaten-down smile. \u201cClear. Luke.\u201d</p><p>Two hours later, Art had new clothes. Functional clothes. Loose blue jeans and soft denim shirts, new tighty-whities and clean socks, new tennis shoes\u2014black, because his chores would get him dirty. He also had a toothbrush, paste, comb, disposable razor and shaving cream. Luke made him a hamburger for dinner, made sure he knew where everything was in the trailer. Then he observed the shaving to be sure Art handled the razor safely. \u201cYou\u2019ll be okay here by yourself tonight?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI like it,\u201d Art said. \u201cI wished it was mine when I first saw it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat right? You won\u2019t run off, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m helping you now, Luke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got you some bottled water and a few protein bars in case you get hungry before morning. If you have a problem, you know where I am. I\u2019m in the house. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, sitting on the small bed and circling his chubby knees with his arms, rocking.</p><p>\u201cYou need anything else, Art?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you first thing in the morning, then. We\u2019ll have some breakfast together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Thanks. Luke.\u201d</p><p>Luke went back to his house. He was staying in tonight, in case Art needed anything, even though it meant not running into Shelby. He felt briefly disappointed; another fifteen or twenty minutes of feeling her pressed up against him, kissing him, that wouldn\u2019t hurt. But now he had another project, one he hadn\u2019t prepared himself for. If Art proved at all competent, it could turn out to be a good decision for both of them. If Art needed more assistance than Luke could provide, he could find him some help. But for now, at least he\u2019d found a home for one of his mother\u2019s many bathrobes.</p><p>A couple of days later, Shelby rode Chico into the clearing that fronted Luke\u2019s cabins and stopped before getting too close. She had saddled and pulled Plenty along. The September afternoon was pleasant and sunny and she could see that Luke was crouched atop one of the cabins tearing off rotting shingles. Although it was cool enough for her to need a jacket, his broad sunburned bare back was facing her\u2014it was a very enjoyable sight and she drank it in, silent. Then Plenty whinnied and Luke glanced over his shoulder. He stood and carefully turned toward her, balanced on the sloping roof. A smile found its way to her lips. What a sight he was, bare-chested, whiskers on his cheeks and chin, wearing jeans and a tool belt. She briefly wondered what it was about a tool belt... What was it she had said about the guy she had in mind? Clean-shaven, starched and pressed, polo shirt...? Nah....</p><p>\u201cLooks like you lost a rider,\u201d he called down to her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for a rider,\u201d she said. \u201cWant to take a break? See if you can sit a horse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this a test of some kind?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll still like you if you fall off.\u201d</p><p>He came down the ladder, grabbing his shirt off the lower rung and shrugging into it. It hung open and her eyes stayed riveted on that tool belt. His hands were on the buckle to remove it, but they didn\u2019t move. When she lifted her eyes to his, she found him grinning. Caught. What the hell? she thought, smiling back.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in a couple of days. Are you avoiding me again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should, but I haven\u2019t been. I\u2019ve had stuff going on. Does the general know you\u2019re doing this?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course. They\u2019re his horses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Shelby,\u201d he said, sounding a little miserable. He took off the tool belt and buttoned up his shirt. \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said, \u2018You be careful of that Black Hawk pilot. They have a reputation for abusing women.\u2019\u201d</p><p>He shoved his shirt into his pants. \u201cGod,\u201d he moaned. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go away and leave me alone before you get me shot.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She laughed. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say that. He said, \u2018Be sure to tell Luke that Plenty nips and bolts.\u2019 So\u2014Plenty, short for Plenty of Trouble, nips and bolts. You\u2019ll have to pay attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBolts?\u201d he asked a little nervously.</p><p>\u201cNot usually with a rider. But if you get off, keep the reins. She can be a handful when she acts up, but she\u2019s a pretty good ride.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAw, man. I have a feeling this is going to be humiliating. Where are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about upriver a ways to check out the turning leaves?\u201d she asked. \u201cThink you can handle that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give it a go,\u201d he said. \u201cBe with you in a minute.\u201d He walked down to the first cabin and stuck his head inside. Art was doing exactly as he\u2019d been asked, sweeping debris into a nice neat pile in the middle of the cabin that had been emptied of furniture. \u201cHey, Art,\u201d Luke said. \u201cI\u2019m going to be gone a little while. You\u2019ll be okay, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Art said, not looking up from his job.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you know when I\u2019m back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay. Luke,\u201d he said.</p><p>Luke went back to Shelby and the horses, cautiously giving Plenty\u2019s neck a slow stroke. She pulled her lips back as if she\u2019d like to bite him, but she managed to control herself. \u201cYou have anything with you? Like a gun?\u201d he asked Shelby.</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBear. They\u2019re still out. Fishing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I have some repellent. Plus, I\u2019m really fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He grinned. \u201cI saw that the last time you were here. I\u2019m not. I\u2019m just hoping I can stay in the saddle.\u201d He went to his truck and pulled his Remington .338 rifle out of the rack. \u201cI\u2019ll feel a little better if I don\u2019t have to rely on you to protect me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNinny,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty, but way more gun than you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt makes me feel manly,\u201d he said.</p><p>By the time he was tying his rifle onto the saddle straps, Art was standing in the doorway of the cabin, watching them, broom in hand. \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d Shelby asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you in a minute,\u201d he answered, swinging into the saddle. \u201cLead the way.\u201d</p><p>He followed her to the river and as they rode away from the cabins, Luke said, \u201cThat guy, his name\u2019s Art. I found him camped out in one of the cabins\u2014filthy, hurt and on the run. So he\u2019s working for me in exchange for food and a decent place to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s staying with you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. I put him in the camper while we get one of the cabins fixed up enough for him, which is why I haven\u2019t been at the bar in a couple of days\u2014I wanted to make sure he was all right on his own. All he needs is hot water, cereal in the morning, bologna-and-cheese sandwiches for lunch, dinner and something soft to lie on. The guy\u2019s pretty incredible. He\u2019s not fast, but he\u2019s careful and he tries real hard. Turns out to be a good helper, but let\u2019s keep it quiet that he\u2019s here until I figure out what he\u2019s up against. Okay? I don\u2019t know exactly who he\u2019s running from, but he doesn\u2019t want to go back. Someone gave him a black eye. He doesn\u2019t have family anymore.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him in surprise. \u201cYou\u2019re protecting him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe was digging through my trash, like he needed something,\u201d Luke said with a shrug. \u201cI didn\u2019t go out of my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could\u2019ve told him to take off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, no reason for that. He has Down syndrome\u2014just a plain old good-hearted soul. But if some asshole who hits him is looking for him, I don\u2019t want word to leak that he\u2019s hiding out here. Not till I figure out what to do about his situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, you try to hide the fact that you\u2019re nice,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s natural for you to be kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNowww,\u201d he warned. \u201cYou\u2019ll ruin my reputation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t even established one yet,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one knows quite what to make of you.\u201d She lifted her chin, looking up at the tall pines, the enormous sequoia, the clear, bright sky. Interspersed were oak and madrone with leaves turning yellow and orange. \u201cIs this awesome or what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome,\u201d he agreed. \u201cHow does it compare to living down the coast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo far, a wonderful change.\u201d She looked over at him and her eyes glittered. \u201cI see great potential for this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlaying with me again,\u201d he teased. \u201cDon\u2019t you worry that you\u2019re biting off more than you can chew, little girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He groaned. \u201cI know I am.\u201d And she laughed at him.</p><p>As they rode up the river into the hills, Luke couldn\u2019t help but find the horse a good diversion, a real pleasant experience. As long as Plenty was beside Chico and not behind him, there were no bad manners, like nipping. They talked only a little while they rode, and after about twenty minutes along the river, Shelby stopped Chico at the base of a trail that rose steeply into the hills. It was marked with well-worn trail that led to a plateau. \u201cThink you can do that?\u201d she asked. \u201cThe view from up there is pretty awesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can give it a try,\u201d he said. \u201cLet me go first so this horse doesn\u2019t bite Chico\u2019s behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d she said.</p><p>The trail was wide enough for an easy ride, made up of switchbacks that went right, then left, then right again in a zigzag that took the strain out of the climb. It took about twenty minutes to get to the top and once there, the valley opened up in front of them, the river behind them, and what looked like a vineyard was spread out below. He took a deep breath and admired the scenery. He could see a number of hiking trails and a couple of old, abandoned logging roads that had probably been used in years past for the harvesting of lumber.</p><p>Shelby came up alongside and inhaled in much the same way, experiencing the view. They could see for miles over the tops of the ponderosa and fir. She pulled off her hat and shook out that single braid, letting the fall breeze cool her.</p><p>They sat for a long time, saying nothing. Minutes passed and then Luke heard a sound. There was a rustling and not exactly a growl but something like a deep whine. A mewling. He looked to his right and saw that at the base of a tree a large bear cub rolled around playfully. Even though the cub was probably four months old and good-sized, he was still just a kid. \u201cShit,\u201d he said. \u201cOh shit.\u201d Where there was a cub, there was always a mother. And sure enough, coming at them from the left was Mama. They had somehow inadvertently gotten between the cub and the mother. And damn, Mama was big.</p><p>\u201cDown, down, down,\u201d he said to Shelby. \u201cYou go first,\u201d he said, backing out of her way.</p><p>Shelby took off for the trail that led down the hill, Luke close on her heels, but moving at such a quick pace that Plenty didn\u2019t have the opportunity to nip at Chico. Bears have front legs shorter than their back legs and it was a bad idea to run up a hill or on level ground or, God forbid, up a tree, but if you traveled downhill, they were at a disadvantage. Ten or twenty feet and they\u2019d trip and roll. But bears could get up a hill with those short front legs faster than any man. Or any horse carrying a man.</p><p>Shelby whacked Chico with the end of her rein and Luke dug his heels into Plenty. He hoped he could stay astride\u2014he wasn\u2019t nearly the horseman Shelby was. And it wasn\u2019t a straight shot down\u2014there were all those switchbacks to traverse. Behind them, Mama let go with a huge and frightening growl. If she got close, he hoped he could level the rifle in time. While Shelby and Luke had to make use of the switchback trail, Mama Bear was making a straight line down, through the trees and shrubs.</p><p>Ahead of him, he saw Shelby managing Chico with one deft hand, her other reaching behind her for the repellent spray. It occurred to him to get back a little, in case she decided to use it and he caught the drift downwind. But getting away was the first priority\u2014he didn\u2019t want to have to shoot the mother of a cub.</p><p>About twenty feet into their descent, it happened. The bear stumbled over her short front legs, curled into a huge furry ball and began to roll out of control. Both Shelby and Luke pulled back on the reins and watched her roll right by them and down about twenty more feet. \u201cStay,\u201d Luke said softly. He pulled the rifle off the saddle ties and had it at the ready.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t shoot her,\u201d Shelby pleaded.</p><p>\u201cOnly if I have to,\u201d he said. \u201cEasy does it.\u201d</p><p>Mama recovered, shook herself off, stood at full towering height, treated them to her meanest snarl and scrambled up the hill in the other direction, back to her cub at great speed, avoiding them.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d\u2019ya say we get the hell out of here?\u201d he suggested.</p><p>Shelby whacked Chico on the butt and urged him forward, and to Luke\u2019s amazement, he heard her laughter ring out as she descended. He was right on her heels, keeping up with her pretty well for someone who was reluctant to put down a rifle that was longer than his arm.</p><p>When they got to the bottom, she didn\u2019t slow down. She put her heels to her mount and flew down the riverside, laughter echoing through the tall trees as she drove the horse. Even Plenty\u2019s Arabian heritage wasn\u2019t helping Luke keep up with that paint. There weren\u2019t any people along the river, but he couldn\u2019t help but wonder what an onlooker might think, him chasing her with a rifle in his hand. But she was laughing wildly. Shelby had hunkered down in the saddle and showed her stuff; she was amazing. Lightweight, skilled, unafraid and fleet. She raced all the way back to the cabins and once there, her cheeks flushed, eyes aglitter, she grinned victoriously as he came into the clearing.</p><p>Luke learned something that moment that he hadn\u2019t expected. This was a young woman who liked an adventure. She liked speed. A little bear scare lit her up brighter than the sun, that was for sure. Now, he didn\u2019t kid himself that he knew everything about women, but he knew when to pay attention. Shelby was suddenly more alive than she\u2019d been all afternoon. It turned him on almost unbearably.</p><p>\u201cThat was fun,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, once the bear was gone. You\u2019re a show-off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are very few places where I\u2019m able to show off,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m good on a horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you are,\u201d he agreed. He brought Plenty up next to her so that he was facing Shelby. \u201cCome here,\u201d he said.</p><p>He moved forward and she met him willingly, leaning toward him. He tilted his head and pressed her lips for a brief, sensuous kiss. Luke moved over her mouth slowly, deeply. Each kiss put him closer to the very thing he thought was the worst idea he\u2019d ever had, and the most fated. He slipped an arm around her waist and held her; she put her arms on his shoulders. When he left her lips, he said, \u201cYou\u2019re killing me. Come inside with me for a few hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not yet,\u201d she said. Then she shrugged. \u201cSorry if I\u2019m teasing you.\u201d</p><p>He pulled away and dismounted. \u201cShelby, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re sorry. I think you\u2019re in control here, trying to make me sorry,\u201d he said, but he couldn\u2019t help smiling.</p><p>\u201cSee you tonight. For a beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d she laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s not possible I\u2019m more brave than you. You\u2019ve been in combat how many times?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is so different. This is a small town. You\u2019re a general\u2019s only niece.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said, taking Plenty\u2019s reins with a naughty grin. \u201cMan up.\u201d</p><p>Luke manned up enough to get himself to that little bar five nights running. When the general was with his niece, Luke shoved off before dinner to bring Art and himself some of Preacher\u2019s fixings, including pie, which Art lived for. When Shelby was alone, he stayed. It had been about a hundred years since he\u2019d played kissy-face with a girl without groping her, but he was able to do that with Shelby and even look forward to it. It wouldn\u2019t be much longer before he pressed the suggestion of more, the talk, and finally the event, the thought of which sent sparks shooting through his body. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>During the days, he worked hard. He always made sure Art was set up for eating reasonably good food\u2014his cereal and fruit for breakfast, his sandwiches for lunch and at least a microwavable TV dinner that included vegetables for supper when Luke was absent for the evening.</p><p>Almost a week had passed since the bear scare. Luke had since pushed all the furniture into the dining room of his house and was now sanding hardwood floors in the living room. He\u2019d just started thinking about a shower and a refreshing beer at Jack\u2019s with Shelby, hopefully accompanied by a few meaningful kisses, when he heard the blast of a horn. He turned off the sander and went to the porch. His brother Sean pulled right up to the porch and jumped out of his Jeep SUV, all grins and a bright eyes. Luke frowned. This wasn\u2019t at all what he had in mind.</p><p>\u201cHey, buddy,\u201d Sean called. \u201cWassup?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI snagged a few days out of the squadron and thought I\u2019d pleasure you with my company. Have a look at what you\u2019ve got going on here.\u201d</p><p>All Luke could think about was how much longer it would be until he could be alone with Shelby. \u201cGood,\u201d he said without enthusiasm. \u201cThat\u2019s good. Why didn\u2019t you call?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when do I call? You leaving town or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. Just put in a long day...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGet cleaned up. Let\u2019s go over to the coast. Have a couple, see if we can find a couple.\u201d</p><p>Code for couple of beers, couple of girls. \u201cGo ahead, buddy. I\u2019m not into that tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when? Come on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just going into town for a beer. There\u2019s a little bar there. Nice little family place. You can come with me or go to the coast on your own. Or there\u2019s a closer place you can try\u2014a bar in Garberville. I\u2019ve seen girls there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds really exciting. What are you, getting old?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>Luke frowned. This was not great timing. He was getting close to closing the deal with a twenty-five-year-old beauty and who shows up but the younger brother who is all of thirty-two. The hotshot spy-plane pilot. Younger, better-looking, plenty of money, exciting life. An officer. The general would no doubt prefer that. He looked Sean up and down\u2014he was tan, had dark blond hair, a dimpled bad-boy smile and no shortage of lines for picking up women. Good lines; Luke had actually borrowed some of them.</p> <p>\u201cYou are not happy to see me,\u201d Sean said. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou going to work while you\u2019re here?\u201d Luke asked testily.</p><p>\u201cIn daylight. When the sun goes down, I\u2019d like to enjoy myself a little. I sense that\u2019s going to be a problem around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight, I\u2019m going to Jack\u2019s. We\u2019ll talk about tomorrow night tomorrow,\u201d he said, heading for the house.</p><p>\u201cShew,\u201d Sean said, annoyed. \u201cThis is going to be wonderful.\u201d Just then Art stepped into the doorway of cabin number three with his broom. \u201cUm, who is that?\u201d Sean asked Luke.</p><p>\u201cArt, come here, buddy,\u201d Luke called. Art walked down toward the porch. \u201cArt, this is my brother Sean. Sean, this is Art. He\u2019s helping out around here. He\u2019s sleeping in one of the cabins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Sean said, putting out a hand.</p><p>\u201cHey. Sean,\u201d Art said, shaking his hand. Then Art turned and went back to the cabin he was sweeping up.</p> <p>\u201cLuke, what\u2019s going on around here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust getting the job done, pal. Art turned up looking for a place to stay and he works hard all day long for room and board. But we\u2019re not telling anyone he\u2019s here. He\u2019s going low profile for now. On the run from a bad group home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Mary and Joseph,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>Forty minutes later Luke and Sean were in Luke\u2019s truck, on the way down the river to the town. When Luke pulled up in front of Jack\u2019s, he saw General Booth\u2019s Tahoe parked there, and hoped Shelby was inside with him. He put the truck in Park, but before turning off the ignition, he said to his brother, \u201cIf you get a whiff of anything in there that has my scent on it, back away. If you touch it, you\u2019re a dead man.\u201d</p><p>Sean grinned. \u201cOkay, now I\u2019m catching on. Oh man, this is going to be fun.\u201d He jumped out of the truck and bounded up the stairs, clearly dying of curiosity.</p><p>Luke was right behind him, but almost plowed into him. Sean stopped short right inside the door. Walt and Shelby were sitting up at the bar and both turned at the sound of someone entering. Luke put a firm hand, a reminder, on Sean\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHoly shit,\u201d Sean whispered. Luke gave his shoulder a little shake and pushed him forward.</p><p>\u201cGeneral Booth,\u201d Luke said. \u201cShelby McIntyre. Meet my brother Sean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir,\u201d Sean said. \u201cMiss.\u201d</p><p>Standing behind him as he was, Luke couldn\u2019t see Sean\u2019s dimpled grin, but knew it was huge. It made Luke\u2019s frown a little deeper. God, he thought, why couldn\u2019t I have had sisters?</p><p>Jack put up a couple of beers and Sean began to entertain himself at Luke\u2019s expense. \u201cSo, I invited my brother to go over to the coast to have a beer, check out the women, and what does he tell me? Not interested in doing that\u2014he wants to go to this little bar in Virgin River. But he doesn\u2019t tell me why. What an incredible coincidence that you happen to be here, Miss McIntyre.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him, finding him darling and playful, two things Luke definitely was not. \u201cPlease, it\u2019s just Shelby. He knew I\u2019d be here. It\u2019s almost a standing date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it, now? Is there another one of you at home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid not,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I understand there are more brothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAiden, Colin and Paddy. But I\u2019m the richest and most handsome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the biggest pain in the ass,\u201d Luke inserted.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you fall in the pack?\u201d Shelby asked.</p><p>\u201cNumber four. Luke\u2019s the oldest.\u201d He looked over his shoulder at Luke. \u201cHe\u2019s very old, you know. And I think my family and your family were at war for thousands of years,\u201d he teased. He sipped his beer. \u201cYeah, the McIntyre-Riordan wars. Sure am glad that\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd none of you married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt last count, two of them tried it and blew it. They insist it wasn\u2019t their fault,\u201d he said, grinning.</p><p>Luke was going to take him home and beat the shit out of him.</p><p>But Shelby was loving it. The sly grin on the general\u2019s face was unmistakable and the amused crinkle at the corners of Jack\u2019s eyes suggested he was getting too big a kick out of this as well.</p><p>And right on cue, the others began to file into the bar. Luke dutifully introduced everyone to Sean. After a few minutes Sean leaned across the bar and said to Jack, \u201cLook at these women, man. What is this place? Stepford?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll taken, buddy. Unless you can get this fresh young thing away from your older brother.\u201d</p><p>The general and Sean carried on a lengthy conversation about the Riordan boys. \u201cHow\u2019d you get an entire military family?\u201d Walt asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, sir,\u201d Sean answered. \u201cNo imagination, I guess. Luke went first, right out of high school, but he scored a warrant officer promotion, flight school, and made it look fun. Big Irish-Catholic family like ours with a Da who\u2019s an electrician, he wasn\u2019t sending the lot of us to college, so we had to come up with alternate plans. ROTC, military scholarship, active duty\u2014whatever. But it turns out I like the life.\u201d</p><p>Then Shelby told Sean about merely being here for a visit, and for the first time Luke had a catastrophic thought\u2014what if he wasn\u2019t quite ready for her to leave when she decided to go? He\u2019d spent so much mental energy on the disaster that would befall him when he was through with her, it hadn\u2019t occurred to him it might just go the opposite way.</p><p>If Luke was quieter than usual, it could be explained by the fact that Sean never shut up. That, and the fear he was losing a major chance with Shelby to this upstart who would be gone in a few days. A few long days.</p><p>Tables were pushed together as those present collected for dinner, and Sean grabbed the chair next to Shelby\u2019s, entertaining her, making her laugh. Luke didn\u2019t make her laugh so much. He wasn\u2019t the comedian Sean was to start with, plus he was sulking. Sean stole the show. So after the plates were picked up, Luke stepped outside into the cool fall night.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t out there long before she joined him. She gave him a little smile and shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019re so unhappy,\u201d she said, humor in her voice.</p><p>\u201cI hate him,\u201d Luke said miserably.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be so cranky. I like your brother.\u201d She got a little closer to him. \u201cYou\u2019re the jealous type, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d he grumbled. Truthfully, he was feeling old. Feeling thirty-eight, soon to be thirty-nine. Feeling less educated than Sean, boring and retired.</p><p>\u201cSeems a little ridiculous for you to be jealous when you keep telling me I\u2019m making a big mistake flirting with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was going to stop saying that pretty soon,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t exactly fooled,\u201d she said. \u201cYou tell me that and then rattle my bones with a kiss that goes all the way to my belly button. You\u2019re kind of obvious, Luke.\u201d Shelby did something that a year ago, even a month ago, she couldn\u2019t envision. But she\u2019d had a couple of glasses of wine and Sean had made her laugh the night away even if Luke had not. She walked right up to him and put her arms around his waist. His arms went instantly around her. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since you kissed me like that. Couple of days,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>Finally, after all this time, he smiled. \u201cBelieve me, I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now you\u2019re in a bad mood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has nothing to do with kissing you. Kissing you is good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not try that again? See if it\u2019s still good?\u201d</p><p>His arms tightened around her. \u201cWhat about the general?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cIt would probably thrill him. He\u2019s been awful worried about my arrested development. I\u2019m sure he thinks I\u2019m pathetic and manless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPathetic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr manless,\u201d he said, covering her mouth in a powerful and deep kiss, a possessing kiss. He moved over her mouth and her lips opened for him. It briefly ran through his mind that he had to have her this minute, but first he should remind her, she couldn\u2019t count on him for the long haul. At best, it would be a fling. A fabulous, satisfying fling. Instead of talking to her about that, he received her small tongue into his mouth and moaned his pleasure. He didn\u2019t want it ever to end and he concentrated on making it the longest kiss in history, hoping to get caught, hoping everyone would go on notice\u2014this was his girl. His woman. He could feel her firm breasts pressing against his chest and knew nothing would feel quite so good as to have one in his hand. At length, he released her lips. But didn\u2019t let them get too far.</p><p>\u201cYour brother is very cute,\u201d she said against his lips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take him home and beat the shit out of him.\u201d</p><p>It made her giggle to hear that. \u201cWould you two like to go for a ride tomorrow?\u201d she asked. \u201cWe have another good riding horse. A beautiful Appaloosa named Shasta. All spotty and gentle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want him to go anywhere with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke,\u201d she scolded.</p><p>\u201cSeriously. I want him out of here. I have things to do with you.\u201d He shrugged his shoulders. \u201cRiding and beers and dinner and...stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better be patient,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHow patient?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She gave him a peck on the lips. \u201cHow long will Sean be here?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSeriously, I\u2019m going to kill him and hide the body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d she demanded, though she smiled.</p><p>\u201cHe says a few days. But he doesn\u2019t know about his impending murder.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow about tomorrow morning? After it warms up a little bit. Come to my house and we\u2019ll ride along the river.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you really want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it would be very neighborly of me.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cAll right. But don\u2019t laugh at his jokes. It makes me crazy.\u201d</p><p>Seven</p> <p>Walt gave Shelby and Luke a little time alone on the bar\u2019s porch. Not too much time, though. He walked outside noisily. He briefly glared at Luke, just to see if he could make him tremble in guilt and fear. To Luke\u2019s credit, he didn\u2019t. But he did pull his arm from around Shelby\u2019s shoulders slowly, reluctantly. So, there it was. Walt had suspected.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m headed out,\u201d Walt said. \u201cComing now or later, Shelby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with you, Uncle Walt.\u201d</p><p>On the way home Walt said to Shelby, \u201cI bet those Riordan boys were a handful to raise.\u201d Shelby only sighed. Dreamily, Walt thought.</p><p>Once Shelby was dropped off at home, Walt said he\u2019d be going over to Muriel\u2019s place for a nightcap. He had a couple of things in the Tahoe already\u2014a surprise for Muriel.</p><p>He loved that Muriel knew the sound of his Tahoe engine, his boots on the wooden planks of her porch, his knock. \u201cCome on in, Walt.\u201d It gave him a crazy lift, that there couldn\u2019t possibly be any other caller. He walked in, shifted his stuff to under one arm so he could greet the pups, who would not leave him alone until they had a piece of him. She was wearing a comfy sweat suit, sitting on her bed, what looked suspiciously like a script in her lap and her reading glasses balanced on her nose. \u201cWhat have you got there?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cA little entertainment I didn\u2019t want to get into alone.\u201d He put a portable DVD player beside her on the bed along with four DVDs he\u2019d gone to a great deal of trouble to find. Not so many of her films were available on DVD.</p><p>She fanned through them. \u201cOh, Walt!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d Then she flipped one aside. \u201cNot this one. I\u2019m naked in this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuriel, I\u2019ve seen you naked. It\u2019s a brilliant sight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but you\u2019ve only seen me naked in the dark while we\u2019re trying to keep the dogs off the bed. In this I\u2019m naked with an actor, a director, an entire film crew and I think everyone from janitorial to the roach coach that brings lunch.\u201d</p><p>He sat on the edge of the bed. \u201cIs that hard to do? Get naked like that?\u201d</p><p>She made a face. \u201cYou won\u2019t get this, but it\u2019s easier for me to do that than it was to get naked in front of you. I couldn\u2019t care less what those people think of me\u2014it was just work. It was right for the script or I would have declined.\u201d She shrugged and added, \u201cPlus, my parents were dead.\u201d</p><p>He put a little kiss on her lips. \u201cIt was hard to take your clothes off for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI wanted to live up to your expectations. I\u2019m getting better at it since you decided to be insatiable. Are you sure you\u2019re sixty-two? You certainly haven\u2019t slowed down much.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI feel twenty years younger with you. And you not only lived up to my expectations, you pretty much blew my mind.\u201d He picked up the rejected DVD. \u201cLet\u2019s watch this one first.\u201d</p><p>It made her laugh.</p><p>\u201cIs that a script?\u201d he asked, glancing at the sheaf of pages she held.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s crap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Muriel, you have to start coming to Jack\u2019s for dinner with us. It\u2019s getting more interesting by the day. You wouldn\u2019t want to miss it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d she asked, sitting up and crossing her legs in front of her.</p><p>\u201cMy innocent little Shelby has picked out a man. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s made a rash choice, he\u2019s too much for her\u2014a thirty-eight-year-old roughneck who flew Black Hawks for almost twenty years. He looks like he could take apart a big gang of Huns with his bare hands. But when he looks at her, sins of many varieties glitter in his eyes. And I scare the hell out of him\u2014a thing of beauty. Well, tonight he showed up with his younger brother, who was a surprise visitor\u2014better-looking, funnier, a lot more socially acute, more sure of himself around Shelby...\u201d He laughed. \u201cAlmost caused the roughneck to take his own life. You don\u2019t want to miss too much more of this stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShelby picked out this guy?\u201d she asked. \u201cThis older guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, there was no question about it. I suspect it was almost the second she saw him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s a roughneck. How do you feel about that?\u201d</p><p>Walt leaned over and took off his boots. He straightened and looked at her with those scary general\u2019s eyes. \u201cIf he does anything to hurt her, I\u2019m going to kill him.\u201d</p><p>Muriel shook her head and pulled the DVD out of the sleeve and loaded it in the portable player. \u201cShelby must be very grateful,\u201d she said facetiously.</p><p>He climbed up next to her, leaning back against the wall, stretching out his long legs, shooing first Buff and then Luce off the bed. \u201cI think she\u2019s secretly enjoying his fear. I can\u2019t wait for this movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a chick flick,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cClint Eastwood\u2019s in it,\u201d he said, settling back. \u201cI like Clint Eastwood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t like him in this. He\u2019s romantic. He doesn\u2019t blow anyone\u2019s brains out or say \u2018Make my day\u2019 even once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you took your clothes off in front of him. I want to see the look on his face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Muriel said, \u201cif you look very closely you might see an expression that approaches oblivion. He\u2019s seen a huge number of actresses in the nude, and remains very much in control of his emotions. He wasn\u2019t tempted in the least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor fool.\u201d Walt pushed Play.</p><p>\u201cAre you determined to watch this?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is going to bore me to death,\u201d she said tiredly, leaning back against her pillows and yawning.</p><p>\u201cWant me to wake you up for the naked part?\u201d Walt asked her.</p><p>\u201cWake me up when you\u2019re naked,\u201d she said, yawning again.</p><p>Mel received a very important phone call at the clinic. She hung up, took a deep breath, looked at her watch: 10:00 a.m. She picked up the phone and called Shelby, but there was no answer at the ranch\u2014they could be out riding. She called Brie. \u201cHi. I need a sitter. I can try to find Jack if you\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just saw him leave the bar in his truck,\u201d Brie said. \u201cI\u2019ll come and get the kids, how\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I have an errand and could be a few hours.\u201d</p><p>After hanging up, she went into Doc Mullins\u2019s office. \u201cI did it,\u201d she said. \u201cI got a county rehab placement for Cheryl Chreighton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you manage that?\u201d he asked, impressed in spite of himself.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy. I had to make a hundred phone calls. It would have been infinitely easier if she had committed a crime and could blame it on booze. She could have gotten treatment in sentencing. This was way harder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe have any idea you did this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to give her time to think about it. She\u2019d just get drunk and change her mind. But if I blindside her, get her over there and they dry her out and get her in the program, she has a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly one,\u201d he stressed.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll never be able to pull that off again if she relapses. So\u2014I\u2019m going over there. I\u2019ll take your truck and leave you the Hummer for patients.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack\u2019s truck would be a better ride,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t do that,\u201d she insisted. Jack and Cheryl had history. There was a time, long before Mel, that Cheryl had a fierce and embarrassing crush on Jack, and Jack had to put her down rather harshly. \u201cI can\u2019t get Jack or even his truck involved. It might send the wrong message. Besides, I keep reliving that nightmare of riding to the hospital in the back of your pickup with a patient, holding a bag of Ringer\u2019s over my head. I\u2019ll take your truck and leave you the Hummer,\u201d she said, holding out her hand for the keys.</p><p>\u201cGood luck,\u201d he said, handing them over.</p><p>After Brie had taken the kids back to her RV, Mel drove a few short blocks to the house she now knew to be the Chreightons\u2019. It was in disrepair, which several of the houses on this block seemed to be. People tended to get used to things like peeling paint, sagging roofs. Plus, this was not a family with money. No one worked but Dad, and he only worked when there was work, piecemeal, probably with no benefits.</p><p>She knocked on the door and it was a long time before a morbidly obese woman answered. She had never seen Cheryl Chreighton\u2019s mother before, which in a town this size was incredibly strange, but it was apparent why\u2014the woman had probably not been out of the house for many months, perhaps years. She had a cigarette in her yellowed fingers and a frown on her face. She answered the door with a barking hack. Mel gave her time to catch her wheezing breath.</p><p>\u201cIs Cheryl at home?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name is Mel Sheridan,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m the nurse-practitioner and midwife. I work with Doc Mullins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one,\u201d she said, looking Mel up and down. \u201cJack\u2019s woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s me. So. She here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleeping it off,\u201d the woman said, turning to waddle back into the house, leaving Mel to follow.</p><p>\u201cCan you get her up for me?\u201d Mel asked, letting herself in despite the lack of invitation.</p><p>\u201cI can try,\u201d she said. Mel followed the woman into the little kitchen, which was obviously where she had set up camp. There was a collection of newspapers and magazines, stained coffee cups and empty Coke cans, an overflowing ashtray, an opened box of doughnuts, a small TV sitting on the counter. Mrs. Chreighton went into a room off the kitchen, a crude add-on in the back of the house. The door didn\u2019t close, didn\u2019t seem to have a mechanism for closing\u2014there was a hole where the doorknob should be.</p><p>Mel heard her in there, yelling, \u201cCheryl! Cheryl! Cheryl! There\u2019s some woman here to see you! Cheryl!\u201d After a bit of that, there was some muffled protest. Mrs. Chreighton came back into the kitchen, went back to her chair, which sagged under her weight.</p><p>It was a household of addiction, Mel thought. Mom is hooked on food and cigarettes, Cheryl\u2019s hooked on alcohol, and Dad\u2019s drug of choice was anyone\u2019s guess. He was probably hooked on these two women and their problems.</p><p>Cheryl appeared in the doorway of her bedroom, wearing yesterday\u2019s clothes, straggly hair hanging in her face, her eyes swollen and barely open. Mel took a breath. \u201cGot a minute?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d Cheryl asked.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s step outside and talk,\u201d Mel said. She walked out the front door, leaving Cheryl to follow. Mel stood on the sidewalk in front of the house until Cheryl came out and stood on the front step. \u201cHow drunk are you right now?\u201d Mel asked her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d she answered, rubbing her fingers across her scalp, threading fingers through her limp and greasy hair.</p><p>\u201cYou have any interest in getting sober? Staying sober?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do sometimes. I don\u2019t drink a lot of the time...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can get you in treatment, Cheryl. Get you detoxed and cleaned up and in a program. You\u2019d get twenty-eight days of sobriety therapy and a real good chance of going straight, off the booze. But you have to decide right now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is your one shot, Cheryl. I\u2019ll take you, check you in. The county will pick up the tab, but you only get this one chance. If you say no right now, that\u2019s it. That\u2019s all I can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho told you to do this?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo one told me. I thought you could use a little help, so I found it for you. All by myself. And no, I haven\u2019t even mentioned it to Jack. You could try this. You know you can\u2019t do it on your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ask my mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t asked anyone. You\u2019re over twenty-one, aren\u2019t you? You want help? Go shower and pack a bag\u2014you don\u2019t need much. They have washers and dryers. Clean sheets and towels. Healthy food. And a lot of people just like you who are trying to sober up. It\u2019s hard for everyone, but they\u2019re the experts and if anyone can help you, they can.\u201d</p><p>She looked at her feet, her dirty, unlaced boots. \u201cI get the shakes real bad sometimes,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cJust about everyone does. They have medicine to get you through the first days.\u201d Mel looked at her watch. \u201cI\u2019m not hanging around while you think about it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere is this place?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cEureka.\u201d</p><p>Cheryl shuffled her feet a little bit. Finally she lifted her head. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cFine. Go shower and pack. I\u2019ll be back for you in thirty minutes.\u201d</p><p>She came back and picked up Cheryl, who carried her belongings in a brown grocery bag. She had cleaned up; her hair was washed but only towel dried. She probably didn\u2019t own a blow-dryer. She smelled of soap and a touch of liquor\u2014a little nip to help her get into the truck, Mel suspected.</p><p>\u201cDid you tell your parents where you\u2019re going?\u201d Mel asked.</p> <p>Cheryl shrugged. \u201cMy mom. I told my mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd is she glad you\u2019re going?\u201d</p><p>Cheryl shrugged. She looked away from Mel as she answered. \u201cShe said it\u2019s probably a waste of time and money.\u201d</p><p>Mel waited for Cheryl to look back at her. Then she said, \u201cNo. It\u2019s not.\u201d She took a breath. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s get going.\u201d</p><p>They didn\u2019t talk much on the long drive to Eureka, but Mel did learn that Cheryl had been at a cousin\u2019s house in some other mountain town for the past year until her father brought her home. And Cheryl had had some delusional and grandiose aspirations\u2014she\u2019d wanted to join the Peace Corps, travel to foreign lands, be a nurse, a teacher, a veterinarian. Instead, she drank her dreams away. She didn\u2019t have any friends in Virgin River anymore, just her mother and father.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me anything you don\u2019t feel like talking about,\u201d Mel began, \u201cbut I\u2019m curious. I know you don\u2019t go to Jack\u2019s. How did you manage to get liquor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Cheryl started. \u201cThere\u2019s a liquor store in Garberville, but usually my dad would get me something to keep me from driving his truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. I understand,\u201d Mel said.</p> <p>\u201cI try to stop all the time,\u201d Cheryl said. \u201cBut if I get shaky and crazy, my dad takes care of it. Just enough to get me straight.\u201d</p><p>So Dad was the enabler, Mel thought.</p><p>The aftercare was going to be a huge problem, Mel realized. Because Cheryl had nowhere to go but back home to her parents, who seemed unable to support her in getting healthy. That would have to be her sponsor\u2019s challenge\u2014maybe they would find a place for her in Eureka where she could work, live, go to meetings, get a grip on sobriety before landing back in Virgin River, doomed.</p><p>It was late afternoon by the time Mel got back to town. She went into the clinic to give Doc his keys.</p><p>\u201cMission accomplished?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAll taken care of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour husband\u2019s been looking for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSwell. What did you tell him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you were on a mission. A medical mission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet that thrilled him. I guess I\u2019ll go tap-dance around Jack and grab the kids from Brie. I\u2019m going to call it a day, Doc.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll phone you if anything exciting pops up.\u201d She turned to leave and he called her back. She turned to him. \u201cThat was a good thing you did. I don\u2019t like her chances, but that was a real good thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Doc.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll my years here, all my years watching her go downhill, I never gave her that much hope. Glad someone did. Glad you did.\u201d</p><p>She felt a small smile come to her lips.</p><p>Over the course of the previous three days, Luke had taken Sean over to the Booth house for a couple of morning rides. He hadn\u2019t done it for Sean, certainly. But for Shelby, because it made her happy to have someone with whom to share the rides. And although it irked Luke, she found Sean amusing.</p><p>The rest of the time Luke and his brother worked together. They finished the floors in the house, then concentrated on cabin number one for Luke\u2019s new tenant.</p><p>\u201cWe should have this ready for you in a couple of days, Art,\u201d Luke told him. That put Art in a fever of excitement, that he was going to have his own little house. \u201cEver had your own house before?\u201d Luke asked him.</p><p>\u201cBy myself?\u201d Art asked. \u201cNot by myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink you\u2019re ready for your own little house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d he said with a nod.</p><p>\u201cSo let me ask you, Art\u2014at the group home, who did the laundry?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged and said, \u201cWe had to sign up for it.\u201d</p><p>Luke was perplexed. \u201cSign up? I don\u2019t get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the clipboard,\u201d Art said impatiently. \u201cYou have to sign up on the clipboard when you want to use the washer and dryer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding? So you did your own?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did our own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did you have other chores at the group home?\u201d Sean asked him.</p><p>\u201cMake the bed, put away the clothes, keep a neat room. Dishes. Vacuum. Bathroom cleaning.\u201d</p><p>Luke lifted a brow. \u201cI think you are ready for your own house. With some OJT on the washer...\u201d</p><p>Art frowned. \u201cOJT?\u201d</p><p>Sean slapped him on the back. \u201cOn-the-job training, buddy. Come with me. I\u2019m going to show you how to scrape the dead paint off the outside of this cabin so we can prime it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOJT?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>When Art was settled into his chore outside, Sean went inside and asked Luke, \u201cWhat are you going to do with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe just got here, Sean. He just needs to feel safe right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to get attached to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Luke shrugged. \u201cLook, the guy had a job. And from what he says, he took care of himself. Sounds like all he needs is a little supervision. Since I\u2019m not going anyplace, what\u2019s it hurt if he just hangs out here?\u201d</p><p>Art stuck his head in the door. \u201cSean? Can I have some more OJT?\u201d</p><p>Luke looked at his brother. \u201cHe\u2019s going to get attached to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be here long enough.\u201d</p><p>Between the three of them, they managed to get a lot done. At the end of the day, Luke fixed Art a grilled cheese and some soup and then, at Luke\u2019s insistence, he took Sean to Jack\u2019s for dinner again. Shelby and her uncle, as well as Muriel, the Booths\u2019 new neighbor, were there. Before leaving, he was briefly and wonderfully in possession of her lips. But Sean, unfortunately, had nothing to do with his lips but talk.</p><p>The next day Sean said, \u201cTonight we\u2019re going over to the coast or at least Fortuna. I\u2019m only here another day and I\u2019m tired of entertaining your girlfriend for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not my girlfriend, but I\u2019m tired of you doing that, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet you\u2019ve already got a girl someplace else\u2014a girl with girlfriends. Do a brother a favor and make a call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing that, man. You go. Knock yourself out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is your deal, Luke?\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath. They had managed not to talk about this, though it was as obvious as a punch to the gut. \u201cYou know what my deal is, Sean. And I don\u2019t need you to jam me up right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Luke. You can pick up your threads when I\u2019m gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot interested. I have things on my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2014Shelby things. Since we can\u2019t share the girl, let\u2019s go find some action. Besides, her uncle is watching her like a hawk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working that angle,\u201d Luke said. \u201cBrother, you have to get out of my way here. I have things to do with the girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are heading for something not so good,\u201d Sean said. \u201cShe\u2019s young and innocent, anyone can see that. She\u2019s sweet. And she\u2019s got that look\u2014like she\u2019d bruise easily. You\u2019d better think about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s under control,\u201d he said. But it wasn\u2019t. He felt about as far from control as he ever had. There was just no way in hell he could stop this now. He was like a runaway train where Shelby was concerned.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s vulnerable. Maybe needy,\u201d Sean stressed.</p><p>Luke knew this. Ordinarily twenty-five wasn\u2019t too young, but Shelby, despite everything, seemed much more tender than the average twenty-five-year-old woman. Maybe it was the fact that she\u2019d spent the years from nineteen to twenty-four held hostage, taking care of her mother, and had limited worldly experience. And he was more than a little aware of her vulnerability, that soft underside that a man like Luke, with his careless ways, could damage. And yet, even knowing all that, he wasn\u2019t having any success at cooling himself down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have to go pick up some supplies,\u201d Luke said. \u201cI\u2019m going to get a hot-water heater and new sink for Art\u2019s cabin. You do whatever you want and tonight I\u2019ll take you out to a nice dinner, not at Jack\u2019s,\u201d Luke said, because he wasn\u2019t in the mood for any more of Sean\u2019s interaction with Shelby. \u201cBut I\u2019m not interested in women. We\u2019ll take two cars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan,\u201d Sean said. \u201cA pathetic plan, but a plan...\u201d</p><p>It was executed in exactly that way. They had a steak dinner at the Brookstone in Ferndale and while Sean retired to the bar, Luke headed home. Sean returned to Luke\u2019s in the early morning. He was smiling privately and there was no question he was more relaxed than when Luke left the bar the night before. The Riordan men carried the tension of abstinence in their necks and shoulders.</p><p>Luke was surprised he could still turn his head.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind me saying so, I\u2019ve never seen you like this,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>Sean rolled his eyes. \u201cOh, brother. You\u2019re going after the baby and you are so tight you\u2019re going to grind your molars flat. Not only isn\u2019t she good for you, you\u2019re poison for her.\u201d</p><p>It occurred to Luke to try to explain that he hadn\u2019t been able to think of anything else for weeks, and he couldn\u2019t remember when that had happened to him last. That when he got his arms around her, he was out of his head. But he\u2019d been running with his brothers a long time and they were all the same with women\u2014fast and loose. They didn\u2019t get like this.</p><p>Sean put a hand on Luke\u2019s shoulder and gave it a squeeze. He shook his head almost sadly. \u201cGood luck with this, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\u2014it is what I think. You\u2019re so into this woman, you\u2019re done for. I can\u2019t wait to see how this turns out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Me, too.\u201d</p><p>Eight</p><p>The last weekend in September, Jack\u2019s bar had to be closed because Jack, Preacher, Paul, Mike and their wives were all going to Grants Pass, Oregon, for the wedding of one of their boys. Joe Benson, marine and architect who designed all their houses and had worked with Paul for years in Oregon, was getting married. It was no coincidence that Joe was marrying one of Vanni\u2019s best friends from flying days\u2014they had met in Virgin River when Nikki was visiting Vanessa. Their wedding brought together a few of the available marines, but was a small flight-attendant reunion as well. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For a wedding that was thrown together in just over a month, it was beautiful and classy. Unlike those casual, low-key Virgin River weddings, this one was held in a charming downtown chapel with a fancy reception dinner and dance in the city\u2019s prestigious Davenport Hotel\u2019s ballroom. It was loaded with tuxedos and limousines, not to mention some amazing floral arrangements and a dinner menu that impressed even Preacher. Nikki had been Vanessa\u2019s maid of honor twice, and Vanni was happily returning the favor. Also with them were their other two best friends, Abby and Addison.</p><p>When the four women started flying together, Abby and Addison had shared an apartment in L.A., while Nikki and Vanni had been roommates in San Francisco. The four of them bid all their trips together so that for three or four days every week, they had layovers in the same cities, at the same hotels. They had shopped together, partied together, gotten each other through a bunch of rotten boyfriends, kept each other afloat through the rough times, laughed through the good times. Now, with Nikki\u2019s marriage, all four would be wed.</p><p>But Vanessa asked Addison, \u201cIs Abby a little too quiet?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe won\u2019t talk about it, but her husband has been on the road with his band since right after they were married...which has to be about a year ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could tell it was a bad situation,\u201d Vanni said. \u201cDoes he go home at all? Does she go to him?\u201d</p><p>Addison shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. It\u2019s like pulling teeth to get her to say anything at all about him. And of course, she\u2019s here alone.\u201d</p><p>Abby and her husband wed after a very short courtship and almost immediately Ross disappeared, along with Abby\u2019s flush of romance and happiness. She grew evermore silent and distant.</p><p>\u201cAbby, are you all right? Is everything okay with Ross?\u201d Addison asked her in a whisper.</p> <p>\u201cShh,\u201d Abby said. \u201cThis is Nikki\u2019s day. I don\u2019t want to talk about that stuff now.\u201d</p><p>Abby held it together pretty well, smiling for the pictures, raising her glass at the toast, but she disappeared from the reception at about the time the dancing started. Addison and Vanessa noticed at once. They talked about going after her, talking her through a bad patch. But in the end they decided to leave her be. She hadn\u2019t wanted to talk about whatever was going on with her marriage, especially not at one of her best friend\u2019s wedding. Maybe she just needed a good, strong, cleansing cry without a bunch of girlfriends in her business.</p><p>The Steak House in the Davenport Hotel was one of the nicest restaurants in Grants Pass and a favorite of Dr. Cameron Michaels\u2019. Once a month he had dinner with his partners and their spouses and quite often, they chose this restaurant. He shared a practice with one female and two male pediatricians, all excellent doctors, all married. As had become typical lately, Cam didn\u2019t have a date. He could\u2019ve found a woman to accompany him. Women liked going out with him, and his partners were always offering fix-ups. There were plenty of pretty nurses signed up to take on that duty.</p><p>But he was thirty-six and heartsore. He\u2019d been looking for the right woman for a long time, though it appeared he wasn\u2019t going to find her. He had even felt himself beginning to fall in love with the beautiful Vanessa a few months ago and it had stung pretty bad when she let him know she\u2019d given her heart to another man. She not only loved someone else, she married him immediately. Last spring; not all that long ago.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t carrying a torch, he even admired the man she married\u2014Paul Haggerty. He was a good man, strong and decent. The problem Cam was having wasn\u2019t a broken heart so much as a tired one. He was a good-looking guy\u2014dark hair and heavy brows over blue eyes, dimples, a bright smile. He was successful, masculine but tenderhearted\u2014women were drawn to him. By now he should have found a woman he was just as drawn to. He wanted to fall in love; he wanted to love someone deeply enough to make her his wife. He was a family physician and pediatrician\u2014having a wife and kids would mean a lot to him.</p><p>The women who fell for him were always the wrong ones. Plenty of the young mothers who brought him their children fixed big, vulnerable, doe eyes on him; young, pretty, married women. He was in the market for a wife, not an angry husband coming after him.</p> <p>He\u2019d had a couple of serious relationships that hadn\u2019t lasted long. There had been a lot of women to fill the time\u2014brief, superficial affairs. Frankly, he could have a woman whenever he wanted one, but he was so tired of that long string of meaningless relationships, weary of the nurses\u2019 jokes about the playboy pediatrician and exhausted from looking.</p><p>So he remained the solitary seventh wheel, lately refusing his friends\u2019 offers of blind dates and introductions. He had grown bored with it all and realized his failure to hook up had put him in a real mood. And sex without any feelings of involvement left him empty inside. He was better off alone.</p><p>When dinner with his partners was over, he watched them go off together, home to their marriage beds and children while he would go to his too-large, too-quiet house.</p><p>The prospect had him feeling gloomy enough to go to the hotel bar for a nightcap. It was late and the bar was nearly deserted; it seemed most of the hotel guests were caught up in a loud and annoyingly happy wedding reception in the ballroom. At the bar, he asked for a Chevis, neat. He didn\u2019t feel like a drink so much as he didn\u2019t want to go home yet, so he spent more time staring into it than sipping. Thirty minutes passed and he still had most of the drink in his glass when he started thinking about facing the loneliness of his house. He stood and pulled out his wallet to put a bill on the bar when he noticed her. A woman sitting at a small table in a dark corner. Also staring into a drink, also alone.</p><p>Cam thought about talking to her, but reminded himself how these encounters usually played out. He didn\u2019t feel like another empty connection or worse, finding someone he liked and being let down. But she was pretty and looked a little sad...</p><p>The bartender wandered over. \u201cAnything else, Doc?\u201d he asked Cam.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. She been here long?\u201d he asked, tipping his head toward the table in the corner.</p><p>\u201cLonger than you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlone?\u201d</p><p>The bartender shrugged. \u201cCouldn\u2019t tell you. I guess.\u201d</p><p>Oh, what the hell... Cameron put down the bill and picked up his drink. He wandered over to her table. As he looked down at her, she lifted soft brown eyes to him. She had that classic, sophisticated look, her shiny ash-blond hair curled under on her shoulders. High cheekbones, oval face, arched brows the identical shade as her hair, and a sweet pink mouth. But she didn\u2019t smile. \u201cCan I buy you a drink?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just having seltzer,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d be very good company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no prize tonight either, which is why I was killing time in the bar. I bet we\u2019ll be able to tell in five minutes if we\u2019re just two miserable people.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders gave a little lift with a silent huff of laughter.</p><p>\u201cMay I sit down?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cReally, I think I\u2019d rather be alone...\u201d she said.</p><p>He sat down across from her anyway and said, \u201cYou sure I can\u2019t get you something a little stronger? Something tells me you could use it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You should really go.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled lightly. \u201cMan, I thought I was in a bad mood,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re working up a good funk. What\u2019s wrong, kiddo? What happened?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cCould we please not do this? I\u2019m not in the mood to be picked up or talk about my troubles, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cI won\u2019t pick you up or ask you about your troubles.\u201d He finished the last swallow of his drink and got up. Cameron went to the bar and ordered another Chevis and a champagne cocktail, returning to her table. He put the cocktail in front of her and took his seat again.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cChampagne cocktail. I figured you for something sweet and sexy.\u201d</p><p>Her smile was mocking. \u201cGreat line,\u201d she said facetiously.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He smiled. \u201cYou obviously need a few lessons in how to feel sorry for yourself. You don\u2019t do it with seltzer, for one thing.\u201d</p><p>She lifted the glass and took a sip.</p><p>\u201cThere you go,\u201d he said, smiling again. He reached across the small table and placed his hand over hers. \u201cSure you don\u2019t want to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d she said, removing her hand. \u201cYou want to talk? Let\u2019s talk about you. You said you\u2019re in a bad mood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough. I was out to dinner with friends and when they left the restaurant, I decided I wasn\u2019t ready to go home. See, I screwed up\u2014I bought this house. Nice house, but way too big. Way too quiet and empty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuy furniture,\u201d she said.</p><p>He grinned at her. \u201cIt\u2019s full of furniture, ah...what\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>Abby thought for a second, trying to decide if it was a good idea to get that familiar. She glanced away from him, toward the bar, then back. Finally she said, \u201cBrandy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, Brandy. I\u2019m Cameron. Friends call me Cam. I have plenty of furniture. That\u2019s not what\u2019s missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it. You\u2019re looking for a woman. There must be something in the Yellow Pages...\u201d</p><p>That made him laugh. He picked up his drink and had a sip. \u201cNo, Brandy. In fact, that\u2019s about the last thing I\u2019m after tonight.\u201d He leaned back in his chair. \u201cWell, I take that back, maybe that\u2019s what I am looking for. But it\u2019s not what you think. I\u2019m not looking for a date. I\u2019ve had more than enough dates. I\u2019m kind of amazed to find myself thirty-six and still single.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even close,\u201d he said.</p><p>She tilted her head to one side, looking at his face. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t tell you. I have a good job, good friends, nice big house, I brush and floss...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not that bad-looking,\u201d she said. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have any trouble finding a woman who\u2019d want to marry you, spend your money.\u201d The corners of her mouth lifted slightly.</p><p>\u201cAmazing. You don\u2019t look like my mother, but you sure just sounded like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an escaped convict? Serial killer or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Grants Pass?\u201d he asked, laughing. \u201cYou can hardly get away with unpaid parking tickets in this town. Nah, I\u2019m boringly law abiding. I don\u2019t even speed.\u201d</p><p>Abby lifted her drink to her lips. \u201cI think you were right about the seltzer,\u201d she said. \u201cNot a great pity drink.\u201d She took another sip. \u201cHow long has it been since you were, you know, involved?\u201d</p><p>He slipped over into the chair next to her instead of across. \u201cHmm. Long,\u201d he said. \u201cI was working up a pretty good crush a few months ago, but before I could close the deal, she married someone else. Real fast. He\u2019d been on her mind the whole time I was staging my seduction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said. \u201cBroken heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all. We weren\u2019t involved. I was hoping to get involved, but once it was over I could see that it never really got started. She wasn\u2019t into it at all. How about you? How long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d she said, lowering her eyes and shaking her head. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty hard to say. I think maybe we have that in common\u2014I was involved. He wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He touched her hand again and this time she allowed it. \u201cJust break up?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. It was over quite a while ago. He\u2019s been with someone else for at least six months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet you\u2019re hurting?\u201d Cameron asked her.</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cI was just at a wedding. Weddings are awful places for women alone. It works great in the plot of chick flicks because it\u2019s tragically funny.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou look like you might\u2019ve just escaped from a wedding,\u201d he observed.</p><p>\u201cJust the thought of the bride throwing that bouquet and knowing I was qualified to line up with the single women to catch it sent me running for the bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo lick your wounds with a seltzer? Thank God I came along.\u201d He turned around, caught the bartender\u2019s eye and lifted a couple of fingers. \u201cTell me about the wedding,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d she said, lowering her head to rest it wearily in her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause there was enough true love in that room to make a person throw up.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cThat right? You represent the bride\u2019s side or the nauseating groom\u2019s side?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBride\u2019s,\u201d she said, laughing in spite of herself.</p> <p>The bartender brought them two more drinks.</p><p>\u201cTrying to get me drunk?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m trying to get you over the hump. You\u2019re sad. And a woman as beautiful as you has no business being sad. Drink it. It\u2019s going to make you feel better.\u201d He grinned. \u201cOr at least stupider.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him. \u201cYeah. Like that\u2019s possible...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese bad nights, I\u2019ve had a ton of them,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it just feels like things work out for everyone else. But if I was trying to get you drunk, you\u2019d be drinking the Chevis and I\u2019d be drinking the champagne. That\u2019s Kool-Aid. You\u2019ll be fine. I, however, am slowly becoming pain free. Tell me about it. The wedding. Come on, make me laugh.\u201d</p><p>She took another sip, getting to the bottom of her first drink and sliding the glass away from her. \u201cWell, let\u2019s see. They met five months ago when they had this passionate first date or something, then didn\u2019t see each other for two months, then got back together. They\u2019ve been a couple for two or three whole months. Both of them claim it was love at first sight. They can hardly keep their hands off each other. There was enough steam in that room to make my hair go straight.\u201d</p> <p>If that wasn\u2019t disgusting enough, she told him, the whole reception was loaded with longtime girlfriends of hers who were madly in love with wonderful, loving, sexy men whom they\u2019d found in the most unexpected places. She, however, had had lousy luck with the opposite sex. Since about the fourth grade.</p><p>That got them started, talking and laughing about the worst dates and relationships imaginable. They went over the disastrous dates, hookups that looked like they might turn into stalkers, their most embarrassing setups. For a while it was like horror-dating one-upsmanship, but it began to put them both in a better mood. Someone to find the humor in all of it helped. It seemed they were two people who just never scored good partners at all. He was thirty-six and she was thirty-one and neither had found the right one. While they talked, he occasionally held her hand, the hand that rested on the table. With either of them hardly aware, more than an hour had passed, and it had passed with some laughter and pleasure, surprising her more than him. He lifted two fingers; two more drinks were delivered.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of odds do you give them?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe bride and groom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the last person you should ask about that,\u201d she said. \u201cTurns out I\u2019m not much of a judge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoin the club,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, I wish them the best.\u201d He grinned at her. \u201cAnd I wish you the best, Brandy. This thing you\u2019re going through\u2014it\u2019s going to pass. Just looking at you, talking with you through a couple of drinks, you\u2019re going to land on your feet, find the right guy. Tell me something. What\u2019s a woman like you looking for in a guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we talking about a date? Or something more than that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about both?\u201d he said. \u201cStart with the date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, in a date\u2014good manners. That\u2019s my only requirement for an evening out, as long as the guy is likable and I have an attraction. For the rest, I have this list. There are ten things, ranked.\u201d</p> <p>He burst out laughing. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not,\u201d she said indignantly. \u201cMy Aunt Kate told me a long time ago, make a list. She\u2019s always right about everything, so I made a list. It\u2019s a great list. There\u2019s one problem. Sometimes I lie to myself about whether he\u2019s got list qualities. When I do that, I pay. Big.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gotta know, Brandy. Give me the list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. It\u2019s very private.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d Cam said. \u201cI might need a list. Maybe that\u2019s my problem\u2014no list. Tell me about it. I promise, I won\u2019t tell a soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said reluctantly, \u201cI might get some of the order mixed up. Four through seven are kind of interchangeable. And I can\u2019t talk about number one, you\u2019ll just have to let that go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNumber two is humor. Then honesty. He has to be committed. Trusting. Tidy. Not anal and fussy, just not an unbearable slob. Good-looking\u2014I mean to me. Not necessarily a hottie hard-body, but a man I find attractive, you know? And bear in mind, I think Liam Neeson is hot,\u201d she added, making Cam laugh. \u201cHe has to like children. I know it\u2019s the kiss of death to say that to a new boyfriend, so I try to keep it to myself, but I want children. At thirty-one, I don\u2019t have all that much time left. He should make a decent living. And find me irresistible.\u201d</p><p>He sat back in some surprise. \u201cThat\u2019s a very good list. A well-thought-out list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. I put a lot of time into it.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. If he were to make a list, that one would suffice. In fact, he couldn\u2019t think of a thing on that list he couldn\u2019t fulfill, if the woman found him attractive, that is. And yet, he was still alone. \u201cA perfect list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI consider those things the basics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so where were the men in your life falling short?\u201d</p><p>She took a thoughtful sip of her drink. \u201cHmm,\u201d she hummed. \u201cFrankly, in the children and finding me irresistible departments. A little bit in the tidy area. And so far the men I thought were trusting simply didn\u2019t give a crap. And that commitment thing? I\u2019ve run through a long line of cheaters. Which I guess implies they were also dishonest.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cThis isn\u2019t Kool-Aid. I\u2019m a little light-headed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. That\u2019ll get your mind off the wedding. So, Brandy, have you compared your counter-list to your list of requirements? You\u2019re falling for handsome, funny men who make plenty of money and are good at number one.\u201d He smiled at her shocked expression\u2014his deduction was completely accurate. \u201cI\u2019m way smarter than I look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not at all drunk. That was sharp.\u201d</p><p>His smile vanished and he looked into her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m really glad you didn\u2019t wait for the bouquet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I am, too,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful when you laugh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re coming on to me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was subtle before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had at least three drinks,\u201d he said. \u201cMy subtlety is out the window.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was wine with dinner.\u201d</p><p>He lifted her hand, turned it over and pressed a small kiss onto her wrist. The look on her face was one of surprise, maybe apprehension. She started to pull her hand away, but he held it. He slipped his other hand up her arm to cup her elbow and put his lips softly against the inside of her elbow. When he lifted his head and connected with her gaze, he found those warm brown eyes had grown darker. He put a hand on her waist and pressed his lips softly to her bare shoulder; he heard her inhale slowly. He leaned closer, his lips hovering just above hers. He could feel her breath on his mouth. \u201cBrandy,\u201d he whispered. She made a small sound as her eyelids slowly fell and he pressed his lips gently against hers. Her lips trembled beneath his so he pressed a bit more firmly, but he didn\u2019t hold them long. When he pulled back he said, \u201cI have excellent manners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem to,\u201d she agreed. \u201cI must be drunk. I\u2019m kissing a stranger in a bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019ve gotten to be pretty good friends,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know each other\u2019s darkest, most embarrassing secrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know each other well enough to be kissing in a bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d he said. \u201cDid I mention I\u2019m staying here tonight? I probably shouldn\u2019t be driving. I\u2019m going to check in and then come back here. We could have a drink or seltzer together, or I could take you upstairs, if you want to. We could watch a movie or something. Talk. Have drinks and not worry about anything. Whatever you like. Be less alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be completely nuts,\u201d she said. \u201cYou do this sort of thing a lot?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNot in years. When I was younger, I was game for a lot of stupid things, but then eventually you grow up a little. Something like this didn\u2019t occur to me when I came over here, bought you a drink. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re lying,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd, it\u2019s not a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling the truth. I\u2019m not drunk, but I shouldn\u2019t be driving. I\u2019m getting a room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when you come back and I\u2019m not here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be playing it smart, I guess. But don\u2019t go. Wait for me and if you\u2019d rather not go upstairs, let\u2019s stay here a while longer, close the place down, then I\u2019ll get you a cab, just to be safe. I like you. We\u2019ll just sit here, talk. Laugh. Maybe kiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a bar?\u201d she asked, but she smiled.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cLook around. There\u2019s no one here,\u201d he said. He gave her hand a squeeze and stood from the table. He leaned toward her and let his lips graze her cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back. Wait for me\u2014I\u2019m not going to force you to go upstairs, you\u2019re completely safe.\u201d He jerked his head over his shoulder toward the bartender. \u201cHe\u2019s watching, and he knows me\u2014I\u2019m certainly not going to drag you out of here.\u201d He smiled. \u201cLike I said, I have very good manners.\u201d</p><p>He left the bar and did exactly as he said he would, checking in to the hotel. It was late, there was no one else around the registration desk and it took just minutes. They gave him a king-size bed in a no-smoking room with a Jacuzzi tub and a wet bar. He asked for a shaving kit and when he popped the lid on the little cardboard box, he found the essentials\u2014disposable razor, shaving cream, toothpaste, brush, comb, condoms. Then he walked back to the bar and looked in. Of course, she was gone, as any woman with an ounce of sense would be. He was thoroughly disappointed; he shouldn\u2019t have left the bar so soon, alone. But he should have expected this\u2014he knew in five minutes she was intelligent and classy; such a woman wouldn\u2019t go to a stranger\u2019s hotel room.</p><p>But he had hoped she\u2019d stay in the bar a while longer.</p><p>Cam could have canceled the room and gone home once he saw that his lame attempt at getting a funny, sexy, beautiful stranger into his hotel room had been rebuffed, but he wasn\u2019t on call and didn\u2019t have to work in the morning. He decided to take the room anyway, maybe turn on a movie and fall asleep here, rather than listen to the deafening silence in his too-big house. He walked toward the elevators and there, standing right in front of them, beautiful in a soft, gold silk cocktail dress, was the perfect stranger. Brandy. His eyes glowed with warmth. He could feel his smile reaching all the way into his chest.</p><p>Cameron walked toward her and took her hand in his. He leaned down and put a soft kiss on her forehead. The elevator doors opened and he pulled her inside, taking her gently into his arms. \u201cYou\u2019re trembling,\u201d he whispered. \u201cAre you scared?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTo death,\u201d she said. \u201cI never intended to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be scared. I\u2019d love it if you came with me, but you certainly don\u2019t have to,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThis could be the biggest, stupidest mistake of my life.\u201d Then she laughed. \u201cOr at least the second biggest,\u201d she added softly.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see, it\u2019s all right. I don\u2019t want a woman who doesn\u2019t want me. We already know we have plenty to talk about....\u201d He lifted her chin and gently touched her lips with his in a very soft, brief kiss. He kissed her once more, lightly, playing against her lips. \u201cYou can change your mind and leave anytime. You won\u2019t get any trouble from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if it\u2019s the biggest mistake of your life?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried. You\u2019re beautiful and sweet and I like you. I don\u2019t care.\u201d He kissed her again, a little more deeply. Then the doors opened and he led her to the room. Once inside, he tossed aside the shaving kit and put his hands on her face, threading his fingers into her hair, pulling her gently to his mouth. He moved over her lips sensuously, tugging at them with his, running his tongue around them. When her tongue joined his in play, he groaned his pleasure and pushed his tongue in to taste the inside of her mouth; she tasted like champagne and strawberries. Then he felt her tongue enter his mouth, slipping around. Heaven. He couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>\u201cScotch,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI can change that taste to Crest, if you\u2019d like me to,\u201d he offered.</p> <p>\u201cI like scotch,\u201d she said, leaning in to his kiss again. \u201cYou taste good.\u201d</p><p>He wrapped his arms around her. \u201cGod,\u201d he whispered against her lips. \u201cI feel better already. How do you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrazy. Completely crazy,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he agreed, laughing. \u201cThis is pretty crazy. But I like it so far.\u201d</p><p>She molded herself against him, her arms going around his neck to hold him. She felt his hand glide down her back, over her butt to rest there and pull her closer still. His arms were strong, firm, but not confining. She could have wriggled out of his grasp without the slightest struggle. Instead of feeling frightened, she began to feel secure. Loved. Of course she knew it wasn\u2019t love\u2014it was nothing more than human contact. But while her life was spiraling out of control, this handsome stranger felt like an anchor.</p><p>The one thought that came to mind should have brought her to her senses, catapulting her out of these arms, this room. But the opposite happened. She remembered she had a husband. And a prenuptial agreement in which she promised fidelity. In the event of divorce, she would not receive alimony if she had been unfaithful during the marriage. Of course, he had made no such promises and had been living with another woman for six months. He\u2019d asked for the divorce nine months ago, but she hadn\u2019t signed the papers or told any of her friends.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t care about alimony; her heart was in shreds. No amount of money would put it back together again.</p><p>She pushed against Cam. \u201cThis is wrong,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of things, honey, but it\u2019s not wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re single, consenting adults and we\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d she said.</p><p>He was frozen for a second. \u201cOkay, this sure feels consensual, so I\u2019m guessing you mean you\u2019re not single.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and her eyes glistened.</p><p>\u201cOh, boy,\u201d he said, backing up a little bit, though he couldn\u2019t seem to let go of her completely. \u201cI hope he\u2019s not standing outside that door with a big gun...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been living with another woman for six months. He served me nine months ago. I\u2019ve been putting off the inevitable. Not because I want him back, but because...\u201d She looked down. \u201cI should have known better than to marry him in the first place. And I never saw myself as divorced after just months of marriage. Abandoned, after a few weeks of marriage...\u201d</p> <p>He looked down at her, sympathetic. \u201cAw, Jesus... No wonder you\u2019re feeling all broken up inside. I\u2019m sorry, honey. That\u2019s a little worse than some lousy fix-ups, that shouldn\u2019t happen to anyone. I noticed you\u2019re not wearing a wedding ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had it on at the wedding, in front of my friends. By the time I got to the bar, I had decided\u2014enough is enough. I can\u2019t stand this anymore, this pretending. It\u2019s in my purse. I\u2019m sorry I misled you. It\u2019s not your problem. I should be going now\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax. Ordinarily I\u2019d run like hell from a married woman, but I\u2019m not exactly cuckolding the son of a bitch. Stay. Put the whole thing out of your mind for a while.\u201d And then he pulled her to him and kissed her again, deeply.</p><p>She swayed in his embrace, letting her hands run over his back while losing herself in his mouth, in his deep kiss. His hands on her were large, tender and confident, his chest hard against her breasts. She felt a tingling pull between her legs and knew she was going to cross the line, let it happen. She needed to feel something; she\u2019d been in pain or numb for too long. And before morning, she\u2019d be gone. She\u2019d go home and sign the papers and get to work on putting her life back together. It was time to move on.</p><p>She met his kiss with hunger that was so real, so hot and bold, she almost forgot everything that had landed her in that bar, feeling sorry for herself. They consumed each other for a minute, then two, then four, completely lost in kisses so strong and penetrating her knees grew weak. She was beginning to feel again, feel something good.</p><p>Then she kicked off her shoes. She was staying.</p><p>Taking her hand, he led her to the bed where he sat on the edge, looking up at her. He gave her hand a gentle tug, bringing her down on his lap. His arms around her waist, hers around his neck, they were lost in deep, wet kisses that lasted forever. She felt his hand brush against her breast and it sent shivers rippling through her. He held her there, his hands on her waist while her hands moved behind her neck to the zipper of her dress, slowly inching it down. He lifted his hands to meet hers, pulling the zipper the rest of the way. She pulled the soft, gold silk forward, off her shoulders and down until it fell to her waist, leaving her only in her small, lacy bra. \u201cGod, you\u2019re beautiful,\u201d he whispered, burying his face in satin and lace, kissing her through the undergarment.</p><p>She held his face against her, resting her cheek against his soft hair. \u201cI\u2019ve lost my mind,\u201d she said against his ear. She slipped her hands down and began to work the buttons on his shirt, opening it, sliding her hands across his hard, hairless chest. \u201cI\u2019ve completely lost my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can stop,\u201d he said. \u201cIf this isn\u2019t what you want, all you have to do is say so. As a courtesy, you might want to say so pretty soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop,\u201d she said. Beneath her, through the sheer fabric of a silk dress and small, thin panties, she could feel him growing hard against her, and pleasure shot through her as she moved against him.</p><p>With his hands on her bottom, he pulled her against him, his erection still tucked into his pants. She pressed herself harder into his lap, causing him to growl deep in his throat. He claimed her mouth once more as he made the bra disappear, crushing her breasts against his bare chest. Her breasts felt heavy and needy and she was already starting to ache in the place that had gone empty and unsatisfied for so long. All she could think about was feeling good, feeling loved, feeling full.</p><p>Cameron reclined on the bed, lowering her carefully beside him. He kissed her as he filled his hands with her breasts. He lowered his lips to her nipples to kiss then run a tongue over each one, then gently suck, drawing a low, wonderful moan of pleasure from her. Back on her lips, feeling her tongue come into his mouth, it was his turn to moan. She was so delicious. Her mouth was slick velvet and he made a long, slow sweep of the inside.</p><p>He ran a hand over her hip and down, slipping it under her dress. Then he pulled the dress down and she lifted her hips to help. It went down over her knees and she kicked it off into a pile of golden silk on the floor. There was just the tiniest pair of panties underneath and he placed a gentle hand over her soft mound. \u201cI want to get past these panties. Tell me it\u2019s okay,\u201d he said, his voice raspy.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He slipped his hand inside the fabric. \u201cYou\u2019ve been hurting for a while, haven\u2019t you, baby?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t spoil this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk about what I can do to help,\u201d he said, tugging off her panties and parting her legs with his hand. His long, gentle fingers reached until he found the place that was dark and wet and it made him groan softly, deeply. He slipped lower. He found the hard, sensitive knot with his fingers and she gasped; he covered her opened mouth with his and went to work on that vulnerable little spot. Instant response\u2014he loved it. He pulled her tongue into his mouth as he slid a finger inside her, letting his thumb make slow circles around her clitoris. \u201cGod,\u201d she said, pushing against his hand.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re perfect,\u201d he whispered against her lips. \u201cGo ahead, sweetheart. Take it\u2014it\u2019s free. Feel better.\u201d</p><p>Her hips began to rock against his hand and he sank his finger deeper while his thumb pressed harder against her. He moved over that tender little knot and in no time at all her hips rose, her breath caught and her entire bottom clenched, bathing his hand in the most wonderful spasms. Instant orgasm. And a powerful one that held her in its possession for a long, shuddering moment until she fell back into his embrace. He stilled his hand, but didn\u2019t remove it. He just kissed her little gasping lips, soft and sweet and slow, sensuously sucking on them while she caught her breath. And finally, as her breathing normalized, he slowly pulled his hand away.</p><p>\u201cI think you needed that,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOhhhh,\u201d she answered.</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I have a pretty good idea,\u201d he said with a soft laugh.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you do that?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cThat was what you needed. Anything more has to be what you want. I\u2019m not going to take advantage of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou about ready to let me out of my pants?\u201d</p><p>She ran her hands down his chest to his belly. Her hands went to his belt, unbuckled it, undid the button on his pants and slid down the zipper.</p><p>\u201cGod bless you,\u201d he said in a grateful breath. She took him in her hand and he trembled involuntarily, it felt so good. \u201cBrandy, I have to get protection for us. Give me a second.\u201d He went quickly for the shaving kit, kicking off his shoes as he returned. He grabbed a condom out of the box, let his shirt fall from his shoulders and dropped his pants, getting rid of them. Sheathed and ready, he knelt on the bed. He leaned over to press his lips against hers and said, \u201cAnything you want. Any way you say. It\u2019s still your turn.\u201d</p><p>She answered by opening up to him. He knelt between her legs and gently filled her with his aching erection, pushing inside slowly. She moved with him, arching against him, and he groaned with the effort it took to hold back. It had been a very long time for him, which had the disadvantage of making him a less than astonishing lover. He struggled, and welcomed the struggle. Making this a night of no regrets for her was all that mattered. He was in some kind of trance, amazed by how pure and right she felt, how familiar, like he\u2019d been in this place before. The way she met him, thrust for thrust, was natural and felt as though they\u2019d practiced this coupling for years.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t remember feeling like this before and he wondered if he\u2019d just lost his mind. Then he thought, is it possible there really is one true mate for every man? For every woman? Do you search for years and then stumble onto the right one? The one who smells, tastes and feels perfect? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He pushed deeply, moving in long slow strokes, listening to the little purrs and sighs that told him he was on the right spot. Her hips began to move in rhythm with his and then as her pace picked up, he pushed harder, faster, deeper. He was hanging on for dear life, giving her a chance to grab on to another orgasm before he\u2019d let himself cash in. It didn\u2019t take her long; she was sexually charged. She lifted her hips against him, her breath caught and he felt her close around him, pulsing. \u201cOh, yeah,\u201d he whispered. With a shudder, he let go, joining her in a thundering climax.</p><p>As she collapsed beneath him, he held her, running his hands over her soft body in a tender caress while she recovered. He was reluctant to let go of her, reluctant to leave her body. He stayed there for a long time, holding his weight off her slender frame, and finally he slipped out, but he kept his arms around her for a while longer.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, honey?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cHmm. Okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d I score on number one?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She chuckled softly in spite of herself. \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned, it\u2019s a mistake to praise a man\u2019s performance in bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were wonderful,\u201d he said. \u201cPhenomenal. Like a furnace, a blast furnace. Hot and strong. God. I thought I was going to faint,\u201d he said.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cYou weren\u2019t too bad.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks. Just out of curiosity, why is it number one?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI guess I couldn\u2019t think of a compromise. This is an awful important part of being a couple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d he agreed. He kissed her cheek and said, \u201cExcuse me for just a minute.\u201d He withdrew to the bathroom. When he came back, he was wearing a frown and a towel around his hips. He sat on the bed beside her. \u201cBrandy, I have to tell you something. The condom\u2014it broke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d she said in a weak breath.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay\u2014I\u2019ll tell you exactly what to do. I\u2019m a doctor. There\u2019s emergency birth control for exactly this kind of problem. If you\u2019ll see your doctor on Monday, he or she can prescribe something to prevent a pregnancy. If you can\u2019t get an appointment, you can come to my office Monday and I\u2019ll write you a scrip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on the pill,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s a relief,\u201d he said. \u201cDamn, I\u2019m sorry, honey. We should sue the hotel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be all right, won\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be fine. I take real cautious care of myself\u2014you haven\u2019t been exposed to anything.\u201d He brushed the hair back from her brow. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. The last thing I wanted was for you to be worried about anything. Especially now that I know everything you\u2019ve been through.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cAren\u2019t you worried that you\u2019ve been exposed to something? You don\u2019t know me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can take care of my concerns.\u201d He smiled. \u201cI get a real good deal on lab tests, if I feel they\u2019re in order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo reason you should believe me, but it was necessary for me to be completely checked over after my... After he moved out. Quite a while ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for telling me that, Brandy.\u201d He lowered himself to the bed and gathered her up in his arms. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re all right, that\u2019s all that concerns me right now. As far as I\u2019m concerned, you have everything on the list covered. Very nicely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis should never end,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to,\u201d he said, kissing her neck. \u201cGod knows, I don\u2019t want it to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it will,\u201d she said, a hint of sadness in her tone.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s up to you. I\u2019d like to know more of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to think about that,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou think,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll try to offer incentives.\u201d His hands began to move and she moaned, instantly responsive to his touch. He was on the rise again, and it was obvious against her thigh.</p><p>She said, \u201cDo you think the next condom will hold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it much matters. Now.\u201d</p><p>It was a very long time before they slept. He made love to her again and again, each time sweeter, more satisfying than the time before. It shouldn\u2019t have been so effortless, so right, but it was. For someone who had been tense and frightened, she had shed her inhibitions quickly and unfolded at his touch, responding to him with a heat and passion that surprised and thrilled him. The level of physical intimacy was greater than he expected, more profound than he\u2019d imagined. He\u2019d had his share of one-night stands, but he couldn\u2019t remember one that felt like this. He wanted more of this woman, and not just more of her in bed.</p><p>In the morning, early, when the sun was barely up, she was awake and touching him. \u201cI have to go now,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d he said, reaching for her. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>She ran a hand along the hair at his temple. \u201cIt was a beautiful night, but I have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to see you again,\u201d he said. \u201cTell me how to get in touch with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy life is so messed up right now,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to understand that much, or last night couldn\u2019t have happened...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of a little mess...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me go and do the things I have to do, straighten things out a little, then get in touch with you. Can you do that?\u201d</p><p>He kissed her deeply. \u201cI think if we spent more time together, we could fall in love. I want to know if that could happen. I have a real good feeling about us.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help but laugh at him. \u201cCameron, you picked me up in a bar...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. What a piece of luck. When does something that great happen? I don\u2019t want to let you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to try to keep me from leaving, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not, but I\u2019d like to call for breakfast. If you won\u2019t stay, I at least want to see you again. Take you out, talk to you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrite down your number. Or give me a business card,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cTell me your last name. Give me a number if not an address. You know you don\u2019t have to be afraid of me.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and put a soft hand against his cheek. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that I feel in control right now. Please understand?\u201d</p><p>He thought briefly, then smiled at her. He gave her a little kiss and got out of bed. He found her bra and panties on the floor and picked them up to hand to her. His trousers were flung across a chair and he slipped into them, sans underwear, while she put on her dainties. Then he held her soft, gold dress for her and helped her into it, turning her around to zip up the back. Next he pulled his wallet from his back pocket, flipped it open and produced a business card. \u201cI want you to feel safe and in control, just like you were last night. All night. Go ahead, have me checked out.\u201d He pressed it into her hand.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019ll want to have me checked out,\u201d she said with a soft smile.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cI\u2019m going to let you tell me everything you want me to know. That\u2019s a better place to start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me wait too long, Brandy,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if I can\u2019t see you until you get your affairs in order, I\u2019d like to talk to you. Just touch base, that\u2019s all. Let me know you\u2019re okay. I promise, I\u2019ll be patient for the rest.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and said, \u201cSure. How could I not?\u201d</p><p>Nine</p><p>October flew into the mountains and in the first couple of weeks provided a rainbow of color around Virgin River. Mel, Jack and their friends had been back from Joe\u2019s wedding in Grants Pass for two weeks and fall was crisp in the air, the nights cold and the hillsides in full autumn bloom, fiery-colored leaves scattered amid towering green pines.</p><p>Doc was at the computer behind the reception desk when Mel came in from the kitchen. \u201cKids are settled into naps,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlaying around,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to ask you\u2014any word on Cheryl Chreighton?\u201d</p><p>Mel shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s confidential treatment. If Cheryl didn\u2019t put us on the list to call her, we can\u2019t get through, can\u2019t get information. I called to ask how she was doing and was told I wasn\u2019t on her list\u2014which tells me she\u2019s probably still there. I could go speak to her mother, but I don\u2019t know about that. Her mother is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not well, and she\u2019s not the least neighborly,\u201d Doc said. \u201cMean as a snake, if you ask me. If I were Cheryl, the mother wouldn\u2019t be on my list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was going to say exactly that, but much more nicely,\u201d Mel said, smiling. Doc seldom minced words. \u201cAre you going to be around for an hour or two?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her over the top of his specs. \u201cLooking to get out of here for a while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to put you out, but they\u2019re asleep in the kitchen...\u201d</p><p>Doc looked back at the computer. \u201cI\u2019ve never been put off by the children. That\u2019s some of your best work.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t agree, I\u2019d get a little pissy that you don\u2019t give me half that much credit for my actual practitioner work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour head is big enough,\u201d he barked. \u201cGo. Take a break. I\u2019ll holler when they wake up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? Because if your arthritis or acid reflux is bothering you at all...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much bothers me besides you,\u201d he said. \u201cTell Jack it\u2019s getting time to get on that river.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s on the porch at the bar, tying off flies. I think he\u2019s way ahead of you.\u201d</p><p>When it wasn\u2019t appointment day at the clinic, Mel took the kids with her to work. Because David was getting around much faster and fussier, he spent a lot more time with his father than her. Jack would take his son with him on errands to buy supplies for the bar or even keep him in the backpack while he served, but he would have his early-afternoon bottle with his mom at the clinic, then a nap in the playpen kept in Doc\u2019s kitchen. Emma, after nursing, would have her nap at the same time as her brother in the little Port-a-Crib, also in the kitchen.</p><p>Of course, Doc was more than happy to comfort, change and jiggle Mel\u2019s kids. He adored them. He grumbled a little about babysitting, but he never once refused. In fact, if she tried to get someone else to stand in, he seemed disappointed. Maybe offended, as if he\u2019d been considered too old.</p><p>This was just such a typical day, a beautiful mid-October afternoon. Mel left the sleeping kids in Doc\u2019s charge at about one-thirty and found Jack on the porch of his bar, tying off beautiful, feathery flies. Fishing season was starting to get good\u2014the fall was excellent for salmon, sturgeon and trout. Jack was an amazing angler.</p><p>\u201cThings have been really interesting in your little bar,\u201d Mel said.</p><p>\u201cA little tense and steamy.\u201d He laughed. \u201cThink someone should take Luke aside and warn him about this place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d finally learned your lesson,\u201d she teased him. \u201cYou\u2019ve been in the business of almost every romantic relationship in this town....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but this one\u2019s different. The second Shelby saw him, it was a target lock on. She wants him. Can you see the struggle on his face? He\u2019s getting lines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, what\u2019s that about?\u201d Mel asked. \u201cShe\u2019s adorable. You\u2019d think he\u2019d be thrilled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the first night he met her he said he took one look at her and thought he was going to be arrested. He might be having a little trouble with her age.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPhooey,\u201d Mel said. \u201cThere\u2019s quite a nice difference in our ages.\u201d She grabbed his thigh. \u201cI\u2019m catching up with you, however.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen there\u2019s the general,\u201d Jack said. \u201cKind of intimidating...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Walt\u2019s a pussycat,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think he likes Luke. They have the army in common.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLuke\u2019s either going to give in or explode,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know he hasn\u2019t? Given in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you taken a good look at him? At his posture, his eyes? Believe me, he\u2019d be a lot looser. He hasn\u2019t unloaded in a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack!\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAnd the funny thing is, Shelby\u2019s downright serene,\u201d Jack said, completely ignoring his wife\u2019s scold. \u201cShe\u2019s a very unusual woman.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you looked at yourself in the mirror when it\u2019s been a long time for us?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt\u2019s all over your face when you need to be taken care of.\u201d He grinned at her.</p><p>\u201cIt is not!\u201d she said, giving him a whack on the arm. But she laughed at him, and secretly knew he was right. She also knew why Shelby didn\u2019t look that way. Shelby, virginal, hadn\u2019t been satisfied by a man yet; she didn\u2019t ache with longing for her lover. \u201cIt\u2019s hardly ever been a long time for us,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>\u201cWhich is how I like it,\u201d he said. \u201cThen take the general,\u201d he said. \u201cTalk about a satisfied man...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t possibly know that. Walt neither looks nor acts any differently than he ever did,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cThe general looks like a beautiful woman moved in next door and he\u2019s doing his best to be a good neighbor. He\u2019s got a twinkle in his eye and a very sly grin.\u201d</p> <p>Mel turned toward him and narrowed her eyes. \u201cDo you really think you know what facial expressions correspond exactly to a man\u2019s getting laid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cIn fact, I consider myself something of an expert.\u201d</p><p>She sat with him for an hour, talking mostly about the new budding romances. In fact, a lot of people were preoccupied with that. No one knew what was going on outside the bar, but Shelby and Luke were there frequently for a beer, sometimes dinner as well, and they were inseparable. They tended to look at each other as though they\u2019d been waiting days to be together just for that little while.</p><p>By contrast, the general was seen around town a little less, leaving people to wonder if he wasn\u2019t spending that time with the movie star down the road.</p><p>It was three o\u2019clock when the empty school bus barreled through town, Molly headed for her pickups. Like all little towns in the area, she had kids at elementary, middle and high schools to gather up at the end of the school day and bring back to town. It was a long day for the farm and ranch kids whose parents drove them into town to meet the bus in the morning, picking them up in the afternoon. As she passed the bar, she gave the bus horn a blast and waved at Mel and Jack on the porch.</p><p>\u201cThat woman is going to heaven,\u201d Mel said. \u201cMy idea of hell is being trapped in a school bus full of noisy, bratty kids twice a day. I don\u2019t know how she does it.\u201d</p><p>Mel glanced at her watch; you could set it by Molly\u2019s bus run. Her kids were due to wake from their naps and she ambled across the street to the clinic. Her pace was leisurely; it was a perfect autumn day. When she neared the porch, she heard her children crying. In itself, that wasn\u2019t a bad sign\u2014they could be just waking up. But Doc would usually alert them if he knew they were nearby. Absent that, he would comfort the little ones.</p><p>Something was wrong. She knew it at once, felt it in her gut, and ten steps before Doc\u2019s porch she broke into a dead run. Up the steps, through the door, and what she saw threw her into a panic. Doc was sprawled, facedown, on the floor. Little Emma, only five months old, was right beside him, lying on her back, her face red with pain or fear or both. David, still in his playpen in the kitchen, was screaming loudly.</p> <p>She honestly didn\u2019t know who to reach for first, Doc or Emma. Emma was crying, so she was at least conscious, while Doc was motionless. She did what her instincts seemed to always urge her to do\u2014she turned at the opened front door and screamed, \u201cJaaaacccckkkk!\u201d</p><p>He had seen her break into a run up to the porch and inside. He was already on his way. By the time she screamed for him, he was there, totally in tune with her, sensing her. When she saw him coming, she lifted Emma right into his arms. Then she went to Doc, tucking his left arm to his side so she could roll him onto his back and into a supine position. \u201cSee if Emma\u2019s all right,\u201d she shouted to Jack. \u201cHe might\u2019ve dropped her as he fell.\u201d</p><p>When she got Doc on his back, his eyes were open and sightless. She checked him quickly\u2014no pulse, no breath. \u201cOh, goddamn,\u201d she said right before starting cardiopulmonary resuscitation. She began by tilting his head back, made sure his airway was clear and blew into his lungs twice\u2014two long breaths. Next she pressed the crossed palms of her hands on his sternum to try to get his heart started and asked Jack, \u201cIs she okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d Jack said helplessly. \u201cShe\u2019s pissed off but not bruised or bleeding.\u201d</p><p>Mel covered Doc\u2019s mouth with hers and blew into his lungs again. Then, during thirty more cardiac compressions, she asked. \u201cAny lumps on the head?\u201d</p><p>Jack ran a hand over Emma\u2019s smooth, bald head. \u201cDon\u2019t see anything.\u201d</p><p>Mel finished pumping and went for the respiratory inflations again. Then, breathless, she said, \u201cCheck David, and if he\u2019s okay, call someone. Mercy Air,\u201d she said. \u201cI need the defibrillator. I need my bag.\u201d</p><p>Jack bolted for the kitchen. David was standing in his playpen, screaming. The second he saw Jack his cries turned to little gasps and he reached a hand toward him. \u201cDa!\u201d he yelled. \u201cDa!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang in there, buddy,\u201d Jack said, laying Emma in her crib. He ran back to the front of the clinic, found Mel\u2019s bag behind the reception desk and placed it beside her, open. Then he ran to the treatment room, grabbed the case that held the defibrillator and took it to her. By the time he got back, she had ripped Doc\u2019s shirt open.</p><p>\u201cAw, Jesus, Doc,\u201d she groaned, breathing into him again.</p><p>Jack was picking up the phone when he heard the sound of heavy, running footfalls and Preacher stopped short in the opened doorway. He took a quick look, assessed and ran into the clinic, kneeling opposite Mel. She was counting. \u201cI can help,\u201d he said, brushing her hands away to take over the chest compressions.</p><p>Mel immediately flipped open the defibrillator case and turned on the switch. The portable defibrillator was the same as the type carried on commercial air carriers with patches as opposed to paddles. She put the patches on Doc\u2019s chest and said, \u201cPay attention for the shock, Preach.\u201d The machine purred and a mechanical voice came from it. Assessing patient. Stand by. Clear for shock. \u201cClear!\u201d Mel said. Preacher pulled back his hands and Mel pressed the button, delivering the jolt. She felt for a pulse. No response. \u201cDammit, Doc,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Mel dug around in her bag while Preacher pushed air into the old man\u2019s lungs, then resumed compressions. She started an IV quickly and attached a bag of Ringer\u2019s, holding it high. It was taken out of her hands by Jack, automatically assisting. She then examined the labels of two vials and drew two syringes. She added epinephrine to the IV. Next, the atropine.</p><p>Jack was beside her, crouched, holding the Ringer\u2019s over his head. \u201cAirlift\u2019s on the way. I called Shelby to help. And June Hudson in Grace Valley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all you can do,\u201d Mel said, taking the bag of Ringer\u2019s. \u201cBring me an IV stand from the treatment room so you can take care of the kids.\u201d When he returned and hung up the bag, she switched on the machine again. \u201cShocking, Preach.\u201d The mechanical voice alerted them. Assessing patient. Stand by. Clear for shock. \u201cClear!\u201d Preacher pulled back his hands and Mel pressed the button again. Doc\u2019s body arched with the jolt.</p><p>Mel put the stethoscope in her ears, listening to his chest. \u201cJesus, Doc, don\u2019t do this,\u201d she said. \u201cGod, I need you!\u201d She brushed Preacher\u2019s hands away and began her own chest compressions. \u201cBreathe for him on thirty\u2014two big breaths,\u201d she told Preacher. \u201cTen, eleven, twelve...\u201d</p><p>Mel wasn\u2019t even aware that the kids had stopped crying. Jack stood behind her, holding them both against him. Mel tried another eppie, shocked him twice more, listened to his chest. He was completely unresponsive. By the time she could hear the sound of rotor blades, tears were running down her cheeks, falling onto Doc\u2019s chest, and she wouldn\u2019t stop compressing. Preacher sat back on his heels. \u201cDon\u2019t stop!\u201d she barked at him. Slowly, the big man leaned forward and put two more useless breaths into the old man.</p><p>\u201cHow can you do this?\u201d Mel cried to the lifeless form beneath her hands.</p><p>Paramedics ran into the clinic and took their places on either side of Doc, scooting Preacher and Mel out of the way. They rushed through a quick assessment while Mel rattled off what drugs had been administered, how many times she\u2019d used the defibrillator. The electrodes for a portable electrocardiogram were attached to his chest as compressions were continued.</p><p>Mel backed away and came up against Jack and the kids. He held one on each hip. She turned against his chest. He can\u2019t just die like that, she thought in despair. David had been crying so hard that his breath came in jagged little hiccups of emotion and he buried his wet face in his father\u2019s shoulder. Mel took Emma into her arms, looked her over briefly to be sure she was all right, then her attention was again focused on the paramedics\u2019 resuscitation.</p><p>Minutes passed as they worked on him. Shelby arrived, running up the porch steps and into the clinic. \u201cTake the baby,\u201d Jack said. \u201cWe found her on the floor beside Doc. I think he might\u2019ve dropped her as he fell. Neither one of us has had a chance to undress her and look her over closely, but she seems okay.\u201d</p><p>Shelby took the baby out of the reception area and a few minutes later she was back, holding a now-quiet baby against her shoulder. \u201cI took all her clothes off and she seems to be fine. No bumps or marks or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe might\u2019ve felt it coming and laid her on the floor,\u201d Mel said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t on top of her.\u201d She turned her watery eyes up to Jack. \u201cWhich could\u2019ve killed her.\u201d</p><p>Jack squeezed her shoulder.</p><p>After twenty minutes, one of the paramedics sat back on his heels and looked at Mel over his shoulder. \u201cAny idea if he has a DNR?\u201d which stood for do not resuscitate.</p><p>\u201cWe never talked about it,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s flat, Mel. We\u2019re gonna have to pronounce,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Mel shouted, taking a step forward.</p><p>Jack hung on to her shoulder, preventing her from going any farther. \u201cMel, he\u2019s gone. He\u2019s been gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said more quietly, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have any response. We haven\u2019t had any,\u201d the man said. \u201cWho\u2019s your coroner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re working on him,\u201d she sniffed. \u201cIf it\u2019s not a homicide, Doc handles it, signs a death certificate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s pumped full of drugs and electricity, ma\u2019am,\u201d the other paramedic said. \u201cWould you like us to transport?\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a breath. \u201cTake him to Redding for an autopsy. I have to know what happened to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am. But I bet we know.\u201d</p><p>She was shaking her head. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have heart problems.\u201d</p><p>The paramedic stood up. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s the thing. You can treat heart problems. You just can\u2019t make it through a massive coronary, fatal stroke or aneurysm if you don\u2019t know the problem exists. I have some paperwork. Stay right here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The first paramedic went back to the chopper while the second began packing up their things. Mel went to Doc, knelt beside him and gently closed his eyes. She pulled the electrodes from the defibrillator off his chest and then, absently, affectionately, flattened out his sparse, white chest hair. She ran her fingertips across his wild white eyebrows, smoothing them. She leaned down to him and put her lips against his forehead, her tears dropping there. \u201cYou are such a pain in the ass,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHow dare you leave me like this?\u201d She rested her cheek briefly against his head. He was already growing cold.</p><p>When the paramedics took his body out, she followed. A small crowd had gathered outside, waiting. Some of her friends\u2014Paige and Brie, Connie and Ron, Lydie Sudder, and others. She looked at them and a large tear ran down her cheek. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I tried. I really tried.\u201d</p><p>And then Jack was beside her, pulling her in close.</p> <p>The night of Doc\u2019s death, after Jack had helped settle the kids into bed, he went to the kitchen and poured himself and his wife each a short snifter of brandy. He went back to the great room where Mel was curled into the corner of the couch in front of the fire. He put the drinks on the side table and sat in the big leather chair, opposite her. \u201cCome here, baby,\u201d he said, holding up an arm.</p><p>She unfolded from the sofa and went to him, settling onto his lap. He handed her a brandy, then with one arm around her back, he picked up the second for himself.</p><p>\u201cHe was ready,\u201d Jack said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to let him go gracefully, so he can watch over the town from a higher place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m having a real hard time,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI know. That\u2019s why we have each other.\u201d He sipped from his glass. \u201cWe have to remember who Doc was and what he\u2019d expect of us. He\u2019d want to be toasted, thanked kindly for his good work and sent off with a minimum of sentiment. He was a tough old codger. He never liked mush.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wish I\u2019d told him I loved him,\u201d she said, misting up.</p><p>Jack chuckled. \u201cHe knew you loved him, but if you\u2019d tried that sop on him, he would have barked your head off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard for the town to say goodbye,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cEven so, he\u2019s moved on, and so will we.\u201d He pressed his lips to her temple. \u201cCall the hospital tomorrow, Mel. Tell them an autopsy isn\u2019t necessary. Let\u2019s not carve him up. There isn\u2019t anything more we need to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to know if I could have saved him,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cWhat would he say about that?\u201d Jack asked her quietly.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019d say, \u2018Don\u2019t waste your breath.\u2019\u201d She turned her head, looking at Jack, and a large tear spilled down her cheek. Jack pressed his lips against it.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to do. To go through his things.\u201d Then very softly she asked, \u201cWhat are we going to do without a doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have Shelby to help out for a while. And we\u2019ll get looking. Tomorrow morning, I\u2019ll go to the clinic with you and we\u2019ll have a look at his personal effects, see if he left any kind of journal or last wishes. We\u2019ll make arrangements and let this town say goodbye to an old friend as soon as possible, so we can all heal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she said. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t want us to carry on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without you,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He smiled sweetly. \u201cYou\u2019d be miserable.\u201d He touched his glass to hers. \u201cTo Doc,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cTo Doc. The biggest pain-in-the-ass country doctor in three counties.\u201d She hiccupped. \u201cGod, I\u2019m going to miss him.\u201d</p> <p>Although Mel and Doc had never discussed what would become of the clinic should something happen to him, he had no intention of leaving the town or his nurse midwife in dire straights. In documents dated shortly after Mel had married Jack two years before, Doc had willed the clinic, free and clear, to her in a living trust that would bypass probate. It was funny to think of him doing something so savvy, so modern; impossible to think of him hiring a lawyer. Also, in the top desk drawer, in plain sight if she\u2019d ever bothered to look, was an old, worn bankbook. Doc had been squirreling away little bits of money over forty-five years\u2014and about a year before his death, he had put Mel\u2019s name on the account. While she thought she had signed documents so that he could payroll her, she\u2019d unknowingly provided her signature to the account. He should have taken a big Alaskan fishing trip instead, because Mel had plenty of money. But Doc wouldn\u2019t indulge himself any more than he\u2019d leave town for more than a day or two. Still, she was incredibly touched. Without ever saying a word and in fact being somewhat stingy with his praise, he had seen her as a partner within six months of her arrival in Virgin River.</p><p>He left a request\u2014not even a letter, but a few sentences in his cramped old hand, tucked into the bankbook\u2014that he be cremated and his ashes sprinkled in the Virgin River. Mel called Harry Shipton, the preacher from Grace Valley, and arranged to have him say a few words when they scattered the ashes at the widest curve in the Virgin. Notices were posted in the bar and at Valley Hospital.</p><p>Four days after his death, Mel and Jack closed the bar and the clinic and drove to the river where, it should not have surprised them, they could hardly get down the road. Hundreds of people from Virgin River, neighboring towns and medical staff who worked at Valley Hospital, had gathered on both sides of the river. As they walked toward the river there was a pickup parked in their path, the bed of the truck filled with flowers\u2014gladiolas, carnations, baby roses, daisies and mums. A man handed Mel and Jack long stalks of flowers to hold.</p><p>June Hudson from the Grace Valley clinic, her husband, Jim Post, and her father, the Grace Valley doctor before June took over, Elmer Hudson, stood at the river\u2019s edge beside John Stone, June\u2019s business partner, and Susan, his wife. Mel went to stand by them, accepting and giving hugs and condolences. \u201cIf you need any help in the clinic, Mel, John and I can probably lend a hand,\u201d June said.</p><p>\u201cThanks. I might have to send patients your way for a while. I don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to do for a doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots of little towns around here make do without one\u2014patients just drive a little farther. Meanwhile, they still have you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at these people,\u201d she said, tearing up a little. \u201cYou\u2019d think a man as crotchety as Doc wouldn\u2019t be able to draw a crowd like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s always been cranky, too,\u201d Elmer Hudson said. \u201cIn my case it came with age, but Mullins was in a piss-poor mood since I met him forty years ago.\u201d</p><p>Mel felt a huff of laughter escape through tears. \u201cMy first night in Virgin River, he pulled my car out of a ditch. My brand-new BMW convertible. His first tender words to me were, \u2018That piece of crap isn\u2019t going to do you much good around here.\u2019\u201d She shook her head. \u201cDamn, I\u2019m going to miss that old man. He was like a grandfather to the kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I go, I want at least this many people at my funeral, plus twenty, just to show him up,\u201d Elmer Hudson said. He looked at his daughter. \u201cHire \u2019em if you have to, June.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Dad,\u201d she said.</p><p>Harry Shipton walked to the edge of the river. The crowd parted so that he could pass. Dressed in a simple light blue chambray shirt and khaki pants, holding his bible, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re gathered here today to say goodbye to a good friend. Doc Mullins served the medical needs of Virgin River and beyond for more than forty years, and from what I\u2019m told by people who knew him longest, he never worried about whether he\u2019d get thanked or paid. All that mattered to him was that his town, his family, have whatever medical attention he could provide. He saved lives, nurtured the sick, brought new life into the world and gently closed the eyes of the ones who passed. Let us pray.\u201d Heads bowed as he recited the prayer of Saint Francis of Assisi, then the Twenty-third Psalm, and finally the Lord\u2019s Prayer.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s quite a bit more that could be said about our friend Doc, but I\u2019m a little afraid a lightning bolt might strike us down if we get too fussy. Doc appreciated a few things in life\u2014he liked some honest, direct words, hard work, good friends and a shot of decent whiskey at the end of the day.\u201d He accepted the urn that contained Doc\u2019s ashes and sprinkled them over the water. The ashes were followed by a shot glass of amber liquid\u2014a little Jack Daniel\u2019s. \u201cGo with God, old friend. Peace and love.\u201d</p><p>When the ashes began to float downstream, flowers were tossed from the banks to escort his final passage. Slowly, perhaps reluctantly, people began to turn away from the river.</p><p>And then Jack opened up the bar for anyone who wanted to raise a glass to their departed friend.</p><p>With the people in town saddened by the passing of their old doctor, it was a welcome diversion for everyone to look forward to Jack\u2019s marine friends\u2019 arrival a couple of weeks later. They always caught the end of deer-hunting season. It wasn\u2019t a complete squad, especially since the full throng had just been to Virgin River in late July, lending a hand when a forest fire threatened the town. Josh and Tom from Reno arrived. Joe Benson and his new wife, Nikki, came down from Grants Pass and stayed at the general\u2019s house with Vanni and Paul. With Mike Valenzuela, Preacher and Jack, that left only Corny and Zeke missing.</p><p>One person who was anticipating their visit but still a bit too preoccupied to take her usual full pleasure was Mel. With Shelby\u2019s help, she had been simultaneously running the clinic, making house calls and sorting through Doc\u2019s papers and personal effects. More than forty years of accumulation was taxing and emotional. She was clearing out his room, giving away his clothes, books and furniture, and preparing his bedroom as either a guest room or quarters for a new doctor, if one could ever be found.</p><p>She missed him so much. Once she and Doc had their little kinks ironed out, she had begun to cherish his grumpy frowns and had found humor in his cantankerous behavior.</p><p>Finally she heard the honking of a horn and lifted her head from her chore of reading through Doc\u2019s old calendars. \u201cThey\u2019re here,\u201d she said to Shelby.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d the younger woman asked.</p><p>\u201cThe boys. Jack\u2019s squad. We\u2019re done for today. We need their laughter. Trust me.\u201d And with that command, Mel snatched up the baby and Shelby grabbed David. They made their way across the street to the bar.</p><p>They were barely in the door when Mel found herself instantly whirled around by Tom Stephens, while Josh immediately grabbed David out of Shelby\u2019s arms and hefted him into the air to check his weight.</p><p>\u201cShelby, meet Josh Phillips,\u201d Mel said a little breathlessly. \u201cHe\u2019s a paramedic from Reno. And this wild man is Tom Stephens, a news chopper pilot from the same place.\u201d</p><p>With an arm around her shoulders, Tom said to Mel, \u201cI know you\u2019ve had a bad couple of weeks, sweetheart. Anything I can do to make it better?\u201d</p><p>She patted his chest and said, \u201cJust miss him with me, Tom. That\u2019s all we\u2019re left with right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, baby\u2014you know no one wanted to see the old boy go. I bet wherever he is, the fishing\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiven his surly behavior, the fish might be fried where he is,\u201d she joked. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here. We need some of what you boys have. This bar has been really quiet. Well, except for the pounding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we don\u2019t exactly specialize in quiet.\u201d He laughed and took Emma out of her arms. \u201cLet\u2019s have a look at our girl. Whoa, she\u2019s putting on some weight. Thank God, she looks like you, Mel. I\u2019d hate for her to have a face like the ugly mug you married.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI think he\u2019s very handsome,\u201d she said.</p><p>The alarm of their arrival had somehow been sounded, probably by Jack from the phone in the kitchen. It brought out Mike, Preacher, and from the general\u2019s house, Walt, Joe and Paul. By five o\u2019clock the men had all gathered and the neighbors were starting to show their faces\u2014the Carpenters, Connie and Ron of the corner store, Joy and Bruce, Harv, the county lineman, Hope McCrea and finally, Muriel St. Claire.</p><p>Mel\u2019s delight wasn\u2019t as pure as it might have been ordinarily, but her mood was lifted by their presence. At a little after five, Luke Riordan made his appearance and Mel noticed that Shelby\u2019s eyes took on a very familiar glow. The early-evening gatherings at the bar had been extremely subdued since Doc\u2019s passing; even Shelby grieved. But with the presence of the marines, everything seemed just a little bit better.</p><p>Luke was welcomed by the brothers and drawn in with friendly approval. The conversation quickly turned to missions and commands as they compared notes, trying to figure out if they had mutual friends or had served in common battle arenas at the same time. Then more women began to arrive and Luke watched curiously as the men greeted each one as if she could be a sister or girlfriend. When Paige came out of her quarters with the new baby, the tot was passed around from man to man, each of whom took her close and affectionately, praised her beauty and snuggled her like any fond uncle might. Her son, Christopher, was soon riding on various shoulders while Paige was being embraced.</p> <p>Brie came in from the RV behind the bar, her home until her house was finished, and damned if each one of those men didn\u2019t have his hands all over her belly like he\u2019d been the one to put that baby in there. After a quick feel, they\u2019d compliment Mike on his excellent potency. \u201cYou got her cooking a good one here, brother,\u201d Josh said. \u201cBaby, you are more gorgeous than ever!\u201d said Tom.</p><p>Then came Vanessa and Nikki and the whole process was repeated again, with bone-rattling hugs and sloppy kisses. It was a whole new experience for Luke. Even in his own family of biological brothers, he hadn\u2019t seen anything like it. But it interested him, the way these men behaved toward each other\u2019s women, as though it was expected. As if they idolized each other\u2019s wives as much as their own, treating them with a fondness that was hardly superficial; an intimacy that was at once deep and completely respectful. The trust was implicit; the affection appeared genuine. The security they felt in their relationships was obvious.</p><p>Luke had never lived in this kind of world.</p><p>Preacher was poaching fish, steaming rice and vegetables, putting out snacks. The man\u2019s typically serious expression had turned happy and his grin was bigger than Luke had ever seen. Drinks and food were served, the noise grew louder as the evening grew later. Then slowly, the women began to disappear to take care of their children.</p><p>Luke had gratefully allowed himself to be pulled into the brotherhood. It scratched an itch he\u2019d had for a while; he\u2019d been missing his own military brothers. But when he noticed that the women had begun to depart, he stole a glance at Shelby. Mel had put on her jacket and with Jack\u2019s help with the children, she made her way out of the bar, leaving Shelby momentarily alone.</p> <p>Their relationship had just started heating up when Doc died. In the couple of weeks since he\u2019d had his arms around her now and then, but she only laid her head on his chest and sighed heavily, tired and sad. The load of Doc\u2019s passing had been heavy, both emotionally and workwise. It derailed what would have been a serious seduction from him.</p><p>Luke went to her before she could leave or get caught up in conversation with someone else. When he approached her it gave him a lift to see her smile.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen as much of you as I\u2019d like,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a difficult time. Are you doing okay?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cBusy. I\u2019ve gotten a lot done without you to distract me. Tell me about you.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cWe\u2019ve been going through Doc\u2019s things. It hasn\u2019t been easy for Mel. I think her heart is breaking, but she\u2019s so strong.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow about your heart?\u201d he heard himself ask.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t as close to him as Mel was. I gather their relationship was intense, humorous, conflicted but trusting. They gave each other so much crap, it wouldn\u2019t be obvious at first sight\u2014but they loved each other. She\u2019s been telling me stories about him for days on end\u2014about him going into the backwoods to camps full of transients who could be dangerous, trying to help them without worrying about his own neck. About the way he used to bend the rules to be sure everything would work out for his town, his people. Really, he was an icon. I\u2019m learning a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re tired,\u201d he said, running a finger along her soft cheek.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard work. I don\u2019t know what Mel would do without me right now, lucky I happen to be here. How\u2019s the house coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe roof leaks, Paul\u2019s going to be coming back out to help,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cBut I\u2019ve sanded and varnished the floors, textured and painted the walls, put in new doors, windows and baseboards in the house, installed new cupboards and countertops. The porch is solid and the cabins all have new roofs, thanks to crews Paul could give me.\u201d His grin became wider. \u201cI can have a fire at night and the bathroom is functional, though I have to do a lot in there to make it nice. Art has a good little home next door. He\u2019s real proud of that. It\u2019s the first time he\u2019s ever had his own house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen we get through Doc\u2019s things, I\u2019ll come check it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need some time, you and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would feel good. But there\u2019s hunting...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s hunting,\u201d he confirmed. \u201cThen hunting will be done and we\u2019ll think of something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve committed to Mel and the clinic every week-day,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for your loss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen follow me out on the porch,\u201d he said. \u201cLet me get my arms around you for a minute before you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the best part of my day,\u201d she said, walking out the door with him, arm in arm.</p><p>When all the women had gone, the cards and cigars came out. The tables were pushed together and hands were dealt. Luke pulled up a chair and eagerly accepted a fat cigar. Everyone sat down except Jack. \u201cI\u2019m going home, guys,\u201d he said. \u201cMel told me to stay, but she\u2019s going through a hard time since Doc...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d someone said.</p><p>\u201cThe girl\u2019s hurting,\u201d said someone else.</p><p>\u201cTell her we love her,\u201d a third chimed in. \u201cThis crap\u2019s hard on the heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell her,\u201d Jack said. \u201cShe\u2019s real tough, but there are times that me being around helps. Four a.m.?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cFour a.m. Loaded,\u201d Preacher said.</p><p>\u201cListen, if I\u2019m not here...\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cNo need to explain, buddy,\u201d Paul said. \u201cMel comes first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe hates it when I shoot at animals. And ordinarily, I\u2019d shoot at them anyway...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo explanation necessary, Sarge,\u201d Joe said. \u201cThis is one of those times...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t burn the place down,\u201d Jack said, going for his jacket.</p><p>A few tense and disappointing weeks passed for Cameron with no word from Brandy after their night together. Story of my life, he thought. It seemed that every time he found a woman who came to life in his arms, a woman he could fall in love with, she disappeared before he could grab hold of her.</p><p>He went back to the Davenport when the same bartender was on duty. Cameron didn\u2019t know the bartender\u2019s name, but the latter addressed him personally. \u201cHow you doing, Doc? Get you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I sure hope so. You remember the woman I met here a few weeks ago? I haven\u2019t been in here since then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVaguely,\u201d he said with a shrug that was very telling. Cameron was sure he remembered exactly, as the bar had been nearly empty, but it was his job not to see things.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to find her. I didn\u2019t get her name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Doc. Neither did I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, how\u2019d she pay for her drink before I got here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSigned for it. She was a guest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God! Can you go through your receipts? Anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d he said gravely, \u201cwould get me fired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said she was at a wedding. What are the chances I can find out what wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe manager might give you the names on the billing. There was a marquee up in the lobby. Last names won\u2019t tell you anything much, but I bet if you called the newspaper, you could find out if they published an announcement.\u201d</p><p>That was Cameron\u2019s next quest, and it proved easy enough. Of course it didn\u2019t turn up any information about the woman to end his search, but he managed to learn it was the Jorgensen-Benson wedding, Joe Benson being an architect in Grants Pass.</p><p>He went to Joe\u2019s firm, handed him a business card and said, \u201cI met one of your wedding guests in the bar at the Davenport the night of your wedding. Her name was Brandy and I didn\u2019t get a last name. I\u2019d like to ask her out. Can you help me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrandy? I don\u2019t know anyone by that name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure? Beautiful woman, about five-three, dark blond or real light brown hair and large, dark eyes. Thirty-one, wearing a gold dress...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuddy,\u201d he laughed. \u201cYou just described half the women at the wedding. The bridesmaids wore gold. My wife was a flight attendant and the place was crawling with gorgeous women about that age. How\u2019d you lose track of her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to know,\u201d Cameron said, looking down briefly. \u201cTurns out I\u2019m not real slick with women anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoc, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll keep your card and ask my wife. Will that help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot enough, but I\u2019ll take it. Did most of the people at your wedding come from Grants Pass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, as a matter of fact\u2014most came from out of town. My family is here but Nikki\u2019s family is from San Francisco. And her girlfriends are from everywhere. Literally.\u201d</p><p>Cameron was quiet for a minute. \u201cShe and I really hit it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet you didn\u2019t get her name and number?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>Cameron laughed without humor. \u201cShe asked that I let her get in touch with me. And she hasn\u2019t. I have no idea why. Really, it was...\u201d He gulped. \u201cI have no idea why,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>Joe put his hands in his pockets, looked down and shook his head. \u201cBelieve me, pal. I feel your pain. I\u2019m just not sure I can help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ll ask your wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in touch,\u201d Cameron said.</p><p>A few days later he called Joe only to be told that Mrs. Benson had no friends at the party named Brandy. The description of the woman he was looking for could match three of her girlfriends, all married.</p><p>The possibilities were endless. She made up her name, maybe she\u2019d had a fight with the husband, it could be a real complicated divorce. Or maybe she was rethinking the divorce. Or he was. If he had a brain, that SOB wouldn\u2019t let her go.</p><p>Whatever the truth was, she didn\u2019t intend to get in touch, or she would have.</p><p>That\u2019s it, Cameron said to himself. I\u2019m through. I\u2019m done. No more talking to pretty, lonely girls in bars.</p><p>He realized this did nothing to put him in a carefree mood. One of his partners remarked that he\u2019d seemed depressed lately. He brushed him off, saying it was nothing, but he knew what it was. She had disappeared into thin air. He kept asking himself why. Everything he remembered about that night told him they had a chance together. He had concentrated on treating her as though she was the most special human being alive, and in fact, it hadn\u2019t taken any effort. She had been. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>One evening when he was the last to leave the medical practice he took it upon himself to tidy up the waiting room. Toys and magazines were scattered everywhere and their current receptionist didn\u2019t do a very good job of straightening up at the end of the day. With just another fifteen minutes, he could have it cleared out so the housekeeping staff could do a thorough cleaning. After stowing away the toys, he began to stack the children\u2019s books and magazines for the parents.</p><p>And there she was\u2014her face stared back at him from a little corner photo on the cover of People magazine. He sat heavily in a child-size chair in the waiting room, staring. If it wasn\u2019t her, it sure looked like her. Kid Crawford Divorces Third Wife.</p><p>He read the story. Oh, it was her. Kid Crawford, a notorious rock star, had chosen for his third wife a flight attendant he\u2019d met while traveling. They\u2019d been married less than a year. He did some math\u2014she had said she\u2019d been served divorce papers nine months before, which made their actual marriage somewhere less than three months. Ouch. Given the source of his current sulk, he could well imagine how tough that would be on the ego. No wonder she was depressed.</p> <p>There were more pictures in the body of the story, plus pictures of his first and second wives and the new girlfriend, who he had reportedly lived with for six months prior to his divorce. Perhaps the hardest thing to accept was that this classy young woman, so squeaky clean and sweet, had been married to this awful, bearded, greasy guy in torn jeans, dark glasses, gaudy tattoos and chains.</p><p>This would explain her pain and loneliness. He took the magazine with him to Joe Benson\u2019s architectural firm. Joe stood, stretching out a hand. \u201cHey, Doc. Sorry, I don\u2019t know anything more to tell you about the mysterious wedding guest.\u201d</p><p>Cameron flashed the magazine. \u201cDo you know her?\u201d he asked.</p><p>The look on Joe\u2019s face said it all. He couldn\u2019t reel in the expression to cover it.</p><p>\u201cAbby,\u201d he finally said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Doc. I had a feeling it might be her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you wouldn\u2019t have told me.\u201d</p><p>Joe shrugged. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do that, Doc. To tell the truth, I sympathize with you, I really do. But you have to be careful about making women vulnerable to men you don\u2019t know. And even though I\u2019m sure you\u2019re sterling, I don\u2019t know you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAccording to my wife, Abby\u2019s had a real bad year. I\u2019d hate to complicate it further.\u201d Joe tapped the magazine. \u201cIt\u2019s been just awful.\u201d</p><p>Cameron frowned and shook his head. \u201cHow\u2019d she end up with a loser like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he\u2019s a loser, but this is all theatrics. He doesn\u2019t look like this. I\u2019m sure half his fans wouldn\u2019t even recognize him. His name is Ross and I\u2019ve never met him, but my wife was at their little secret wedding and she says he\u2019s a good-looking, clean-cut, charming kind of guy. Except not for long, I guess.\u201d</p> <p>Cameron hung his head for a second, taking it in. \u201cGotcha. You still have my card?\u201d he asked, digging in his back pocket for his wallet.</p><p>Joe held up a hand. \u201cI\u2019ve got it,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIf you could just get word to her that I\u2019d like to hear from her sometime....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could try that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t hear from you, I\u2019ll consider the matter closed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019ll ask my wife to get in touch with her.\u201d</p><p>A couple of days went by with no phone call and he knew\u2014there wouldn\u2019t be one. If she had any interest, this was a good time for her to reach out to someone who cared about her, wanted to begin a relationship that wasn\u2019t like this loony rock-star thing. He forced himself to accept the facts\u2014it was a one-night stand. It was over.</p><p>Ten</p> <p>Abby MacCall Crawford, aka Brandy one time only, had had a very simple plan when she returned to L.A. from the wedding in Grants Pass. She was going to sign the divorce papers, be free in two shakes and work on rebuilding her life. After all, her marriage to Ross Crawford had been over almost as soon as it began and while technically she\u2019d been Mrs. Crawford for nine months, he\u2019d lived with another woman for over six and she hadn\u2019t seen him or talked to him in ten. This should be a mere formality. Long overdue.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t going to be that easy for Abby.</p><p>First of all, she had to hire a lawyer because there were \u201cterms\u201d in Ross\u2019s settlement offer. Her husband had run up some impressive bills on credit cards, most of them during their separation, and she was stuck for her half, even though her income wasn\u2019t a tenth of his. Just negotiating the amount down to a third of what Ross demanded cost her huge attorney fees and still left her with a bill she could never pay. And she was asking herself for the millionth time how she\u2019d gotten herself in this mess.</p><p>Ross Crawford had swept her off her feet with his practiced flirtations and she had fallen hard and fast. He was a musician, the bass guitarist in a band that had several popular albums out. She had met him on the airplane. His appearance in first class was so different from the one he presented while onstage. He was clean-cut in his khakis and crisp white shirt, his hair neatly cropped, face clean shaven, smile dazzling. He had such charisma, such humor! Onstage he wore ripped jeans, chains, and affected a scruffy three-day growth of beard that he only let grow out before he performed, and long shaggy hair that wasn\u2019t his. She knew the band; it made her laugh to think it was the same man. Abby fell in love with a semifamous rock star and even saw her own face on the cover of a tabloid more than once.</p><p>When she met him, Ross had been returning to Los Angeles after being in drug treatment, a secret carefully guarded from the public. But the secret wasn\u2019t that Ross had used drugs, but rather that he\u2019d stopped; there was a certain druggie mystique about rock stars that made them seem more edgy and dangerous, more popular. The fact he was in recovery didn\u2019t deter her from seeing him; she was proud of him. He went to meetings every day and couldn\u2019t talk about anything but his program. His sincerity was riveting. The other guys in the band didn\u2019t use, he said. In fact, they were the ones that did the intervention, demanded the life change if he was going to stay with them. He spoke the gospel; he was clean as a whistle, proven by regular urine tests. He wanted a stable life, a wife, a family, something genuine to come home to.</p><p>Abby had married him too quickly because she was with him every day and night anyway. After only a few weeks of marital bliss, Ross was back on tour with the band. The daily phone calls lasted only a couple of weeks and though she could arrange her flying schedule around his tour pretty easily, he told her he was just too busy with the band, rehearsals, travel and grueling performances. But she knew\u2014he started using again right away. She could hear it in his voice\u2014first the slur of alcohol, then the sharp euphoria of cocaine as well. Then he stopped picking up her calls; she went straight to voice mail.</p><p>Her own naivete had so embarrassed her that for weeks that turned into months she tried pretending everything was all right, that it was simply difficult being separated while he was on tour with the band. Then his picture started appearing in the media with other women. Then his lawyer called her; she was served papers. Ross had never bothered calling, himself. By the time she gathered with some of her girlfriends at Nikki\u2019s wedding in Grants Pass, everyone knew it had fallen apart long ago and she was faced with their pity. So she had slipped away from the reception before it was over, then out of town first thing in the morning.</p><p>A turning point for her had been a night of wonderful love in the arms of a stranger. It had been a complete accident. When he left her in the bar to book a room, she had no intention of spending the night with him. She got up from her table and went to the elevators to go to her own room. But when he saw her there, thinking she was waiting for him, the look on his face was so sweet and sexy, she melted. When he took her hand and pulled her carefully into his arms, the need to be held and treated with love surpassed any common sense she might\u2019ve possessed.</p><p>At the time she was glad to have had that night. Something about it showed her that life wasn\u2019t over, that after the divorce was final she might actually find happiness someday. It had been her intention to just go back to work, careful not to allow herself to get close to any flirtatious passengers, and go about the business of recovering from the shattered expectations she had had of love. Then she would start anew. When the divorce and her recovery were complete, she thought she might get in touch with that beautiful stranger and maybe get to know him better.</p><p>But in the chilly days of late October, her divorce still not final, she was sitting in her doctor\u2019s office, tears pouring down her cheeks. \u201cI just don\u2019t see how this could have happened. I\u2019ve been on the pill forever and never before...\u201d</p><p>Dr. Pollock took her hand in both of his. \u201cI can tell you exactly how,\u201d he said. \u201cYou were taking antibiotics for an ear infection and it rendered your oral contraceptive ineffective. Didn\u2019t they warn you about that at the clinic? When they prescribed the antibiotic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey might have,\u201d she said with a sniff. In fact, who knows what they said? There were many colliding facts\u2014one, she had to have something to heal her ears\u2014she was flying after all. When she realized she couldn\u2019t clear her ears without pain and would be on duty in three days, she went to the airline\u2019s outpatient clinic right away. If they\u2019d said anything about her birth control being useless to her, she wouldn\u2019t have given it a thought\u2014she wasn\u2019t making use of her birth control. Her husband was gone; his lawyers had called her every week about that divorce. And then, a handsome young doctor had found her sad and lonely in a hotel bar, bought her a couple of champagne cocktails, led her upstairs and made incredible, unforgettable love to her.</p><p>A complete stranger. She had become pregnant by a complete stranger.</p><p>\u201cDear God,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d she wept.</p><p>\u201cYou have a few options,\u201d her doctor said. \u201cBut you should make a decision about whether to continue the pregnancy as soon as possible. The longer you put it off, the more complicated it gets.\u201d</p><p>It briefly crossed her mind to get in touch with Cameron Michaels. Nikki had called her to ask her if she\u2019d met the man; he\u2019d gone to Joe\u2019s office, looking for a way to get in touch with a woman who fit her description. Abby played dumb; she wasn\u2019t about to tell even her closest friends what had happened before she had a plan. \u201cGee,\u201d she\u2019d said to her friend, \u201cI ran into a couple of real nice guys in the hotel bar, but that name doesn\u2019t ring a bell.\u201d</p><p>Now it was too late. Now if she saw him again, he\u2019d know he had fathered her child and she\u2019d be stuck with him for life, if only as the baby\u2019s father. And what if she learned she didn\u2019t want a permanent relationship with him? She couldn\u2019t take the risk. That he had been perfect that one night didn\u2019t mean anything! Even Ross had been perfect longer than that!</p><p>Then everything had become a horrible mess; as if the divorce wasn\u2019t enough, being followed constantly by people with cameras, hungry for the ugly details, made it so much worse. Ross had made himself excellent tabloid fodder.</p><p>And then there was that other sticky thing\u2014the prenup. Ross\u2019s attorney would begin sending her a settlement every month\u2014ten thousand dollars\u2014predicated on her fidelity during their marriage. When she signed the agreement, it seemed almost silly\u2014if she promised to be completely faithful during her marriage, he would pay her that amount in the event of divorce, up to the date of her remarriage. Rich guys had to make deals like that\u2014so short-term wives didn\u2019t walk away with millions. She hadn\u2019t expected to be a short-term wife.</p><p>If her pregnancy became obvious, it was possible Ross or his legal beagles would be able to prove she\u2019d had sex with another man more than a month before the divorce was final. To give up the alimony was nothing to her; she didn\u2019t care about that. But the bills Ross had left her with were huge. Cheating him out of alimony wasn\u2019t on her mind, but those bills that claimed more than forty grand owing were his, not hers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She could have this baby if she could find a way to conceal her pregnancy, or at least the time of conception. She had left Grants Pass, returned to Los Angeles, called a lawyer and signed the papers within a couple of weeks\u2014but it was another month before she was a single woman\u2014and a good OB could determine the due date extremely closely with the use of an ultrasound. Any doubt would send her to court, which would cost even more. Abby wasn\u2019t a millionaire rock star, she was a flight attendant whose income was completely eaten up by her living expenses, her savings and equity in her small town house zapped by legal fees. She\u2019d have to go into deep cover; she couldn\u2019t even return to her family in Seattle to wait out the delivery.</p><p>She decided quickly. She was going to give birth, but no one would know about it until it was over and the baby, hopefully, a few months old at least.</p><p>When Paul Haggerty decided to relocate part of his construction company to Virgin River from Grants Pass, his mother\u2019s only requirement was that he bring the grandchildren back to visit once a month. The only child since his union with Vanessa so far was little Matt, her son from her previous marriage, but to Marianne Haggerty, little Matt was as much her grandson as if he was Paul\u2019s very own. And for Vanessa, these little trips to Paul\u2019s family were a delightful respite. In fact, she used the trip to make sure Mattie had at least an afternoon with his biological grandparents, Carol and Lance Rutledge, as well.</p> <p>On this particular early-November weekend, Matt wasn\u2019t finding the visit quite as enjoyable as usual. He\u2019d been teething and had developed diarrhea and a bad cold. When, on Saturday morning, a scary-sounding cough settled into his chest, Vanni and Paul were strongly considering a trip to the emergency room.</p><p>But Paul wanted the baby treated by a doctor he knew he could trust. On impulse, he picked up the phone and called Cam. \u201cIt\u2019s Paul Haggerty, Cameron. Hey, man, I\u2019m real sorry to bother you at home, but we\u2019re visiting my folks here in town and the baby\u2019s sick. He\u2019s got a fever, diarrhea and an awful thick cough. Any chance you\u2019re on call? Or maybe you could recommend someone for us to take him to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not busy, Paul. Bring the baby over to the office and let\u2019s have a look,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cI\u2019ll be there in half an hour to unlock the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, man, you don\u2019t know how much I appreciate this. I think Vanni\u2019s getting herself worked up. Hell, what am I saying\u2014I\u2019m getting worked up.\u201d</p><p>Cameron beat them to the peds office and when Vanni and Paul arrived with the baby, Vanni was tearing up from worry. \u201cHey now,\u201d Cameron said, dropping an arm around her shoulders. \u201cLet\u2019s not get all upset until we know what to get upset about, huh? Hey, big fella,\u201d he said, taking the baby out of her arms. \u201cWow, you\u2019ve just about doubled in size!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCameron, I don\u2019t know how to thank you,\u201d she said. \u201cI was doing fine until he started coughing.\u201d Right on cue, Mattie let go with a large, deep, gravelly cough that turned him red in the face.</p><p>Cameron put the baby on the exam table and listened to his chest first. He took his temperature, looked in his ears and throat, and palpated his chubby little body. \u201cIs he still on the breast?\u201d Cameron asked.</p><p>\u201cA couple of times a day. Maybe three\u2014morning, afternoon nap, bedtime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do\u2014he\u2019s not going to love this. This could be croup. At least bronchitis. His color is still good and he isn\u2019t having trouble breathing, but that crowlike barking cough is a dead giveaway. I\u2019ll need an X-ray, but I\u2019ll call ahead for you\u2014I don\u2019t want him sitting around a roomful of sick people, or infecting a roomful of people with sprained ankles. I\u2019m going to give him antibiotics and a little oxygen before you leave here, and a nice big dose of baby Tylenol for the fever. You\u2019re going to have to keep him on clear liquids\u2014Pediolyte works. No breast milk, no formula, no juice, no food. Antibiotics tend to cause diarrhea and you\u2019ve already got some of that going on\u2014we don\u2019t want to aggravate it. When you get home, I want you to spend a lot of time in a steamy shower to loosen up his chest. Do that as often as you can stand it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWatch him closely. If he has trouble breathing at all or if his color takes on a bluish tint, call me to meet you in the E.R.\u2014I\u2019ll give you my cell number. But I think we caught it in time. Lots of clear liquids, Vanni. Tylenol every four hours. Do you know what to do if he spikes a high fever?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCool bath?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNot cold, not warm. Tepid,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t leave him in there long, just give him a nice dunk, run a cloth over his little body and dry him off. He\u2019s only 101.4 now, before the Tylenol\u2014not scary high for his age. If he gets close to 103, call me immediately. You should be able to keep it under control with regular Tylenol.\u201d</p><p>Cameron dosed the baby from his drug cabinet. Then he hooked up the oxygen and, holding the baby on his lap, managed to get the cannulas in the baby\u2019s nostrils despite his squirming. He held him while the oxygen drifted in and the baby calmed in his experienced hands. \u201cWhen are you planning to head back to Virgin River?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were going to go tomorrow afternoon,\u201d Paul said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like you to stick close until it\u2019s clear he\u2019s recovering. You don\u2019t want to be out on the road and have this thing rear its ugly head. I can\u2019t think of anything more likely to bring that on than hours on his back in a car seat. Attacks of croup tend to come in the night\u2014you might not get much rest tonight or tomorrow night. Can you shoot for Tuesday for going back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do whatever you say,\u201d Paul said, slipping an arm around Vanni\u2019s waist.</p><p>\u201cOkay, if you don\u2019t have to bring him back to me before, let me take a look at him, listen to his chest, on Tuesday morning. If it sounds good, you can hit the road. You should probably have Doc Mullins take a look when you get back to Virgin River. He\u2019s probably treated a bucketful of croup in his years there.\u201d</p><p>Paul and Vanni exchanged shocked looks, then turned those very expressions back to Cameron. \u201cJesus, Cameron, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI guess you\u2019d have no way of knowing\u2014Doc Mullins died a little over a month ago.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Cameron asked, surprised. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Paul shrugged. \u201cNot entirely sure. Mel found him facedown on the clinic floor and tried to revive him with CPR, but he never came around. The new baby, little Emma, was lying on the floor right next to him, like maybe he\u2019d been holding her when he had a heart attack or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Jesus,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cThat\u2019s awful. Emma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Thank God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the town holding up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKinda shaky,\u201d Paul said. \u201cMel\u2019s doing her best at the clinic. Vanni\u2019s cousin Shelby has been visiting for a while now and she\u2019s going in to the clinic every day to help out with the kids, patients and paperwork. Docs Stone and Hudson from Grace Valley are taking the patients Mel can\u2019t cover. But just going through Doc\u2019s stuff\u2014over forty years\u2019 worth\u2014has really taken its toll on Mel. She\u2019s grieving and overworked\u2014and little Emma is barely six months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least she\u2019s got Shelby. For now,\u201d Vanessa said. \u201cBut Shelby is just visiting. She was planning to leave after the holidays. God, Cameron, I\u2019m sorry we didn\u2019t think to call you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you, Vanni?\u201d Cameron said. \u201cI met the man once, talked with him for less than an hour. I got a big kick out of him in that short time and it was obvious he was a crackerjack small-town doc who cared about his people. Besides you two, we didn\u2019t have any mutual friends. But damn, that\u2019s a great loss for Virgin River.\u201d Matt had drifted off in his arms and was breathing well, coughing less with the oxygen. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry to hear about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMel has advertised for a new doctor for the town, but who\u2019d want to come to a town that size? I have no idea what the pay is\u2014I guess it\u2019s whatever you get. I know Mel and Jack put a lot of produce, wine and meat in the bar from patients paying with what they get off the land.\u201d</p><p>Cameron chuckled. \u201cSounds kind of nice, actually. It\u2019s gotta beat wrangling with the insurance companies.\u201d</p><p>Paul laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s not a problem in Virgin River. Not many folks have medical coverage.\u201d</p><p>Cameron put the stethoscope in his ears and listened briefly to Matt\u2019s chest. \u201cThat\u2019s a little better,\u201d he said. He held the baby a while longer. \u201cPlease give my condolences to Mel,\u201d he said. His eyes focused on the baby, he said, \u201cDoc was a little snarly, but I bet he had a heart of gold.\u201d Then he looked up at Vanessa and Paul and gave a little smile. \u201cHow are you two getting along?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI\u2019m building in Virgin River. I\u2019ve got a house under construction for Vanni in addition to a couple of other properties.\u201d He kissed her temple. \u201cI think Vanni can convince you she didn\u2019t make a big mistake on me.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at Paul, confirming that she was happy. \u201cWe\u2019re still living with Dad,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the house will be ready before Christmas\u2014and it\u2019s on Dad\u2019s land so we\u2019ll be close, but not too close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re starting to think about the next baby,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou should. Get \u2019em while you can,\u201d Cameron said.</p><p>\u201cPaige delivered last summer, a little girl. Brie\u2019s due around Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey just keep coming,\u201d Cameron said, shaking his head with a chuckle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard Virgin River is a fertile place,\u201d Vanni said, laughing.</p><p>\u201cYou fish, Cameron?\u201d Paul asked.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t done much but doctor in a long time,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cCome on down and fish,\u201d Paul invited. \u201cTake a couple of days. I\u2019ll take you out to the Virgin. The salmon are starting to run. The sturgeons fat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds nice. You fishing a lot?\u201d Cameron asked.</p><p>\u201cNah. I\u2019ve got houses going. But if you come down, I\u2019ll knock off for a couple mornings\u2014I have good supervisors now. Or I\u2019ll send Jack out there with you. Jack loves any excuse to get out on the river.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about that,\u201d he said. He pulled the cannulas out of the baby\u2019s nose. \u201cOkay, now hear me on this, Vanessa. No matter how much he fusses, only clear liquids. If we don\u2019t treat the diarrhea along with the upper-respiratory problems, he\u2019ll dehydrate. And get in the steam, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, taking the baby from him. \u201cWhat do we owe you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d Cameron laughed. \u201cHow about a day out on the river?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal,\u201d Paul said, smiling. He stuck out his hand. \u201cYou came in real handy, buddy. I can\u2019t tell you how much we appreciate this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you called me. This little guy needs to feel better.\u201d</p><p>Cameron Michaels didn\u2019t call anyone in Virgin River. He had three days off and just drove down. He went first to the clinic, walked in and found Mel at the computer. \u201cHey,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she returned, standing up from the desk. \u201cWhat brings you down here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if Paul or Vanni mentioned, I just heard about Doc. I had a few days off and wanted to deliver my condolences in person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. He\u2019s a hard one to lose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your search for a new doctor coming?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo response,\u201d she said with a shrug. \u201cBut that\u2019s not a surprise\u2014we barely started looking. Plus, Hope\u2019s been looking for a doctor to help Doc for years and no one ever responded. I was the closest thing and honestly, if I hadn\u2019t had special circumstances, I might not have considered Virgin River, either.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCan I ask\u2014about the special circumstances?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said. \u201cHow about a cup of coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be great,\u201d he said with a smile.</p> <p>\u201cSit tight, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>Shelby was in the kitchen, sitting at the table sorting some paperwork while the kids slept\u2014one in a playpen, one in a portable crib. Mel poured coffee and invited Shelby to join them in Doc\u2019s office so as not to wake the children. Once there, she introduced them, and Cameron expressed his condolences again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been boring Shelby with stories from my years in L.A.,\u201d Mel said. \u201cI was widowed when I met Jack. My husband was an E.R. doctor. We worked together for years before he was killed. I was looking for a new start, out of L.A. I found Virgin River at the nurses\u2019 registry where I\u2019d placed my r\u00e9sum\u00e9. I came here, sight unseen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd found it perfect for you?\u201d Cameron asked.</p><p>\u201cFar from it,\u201d she said. \u201cThe town was misrepresented, the pay miserable, the cabin that was to be my rent-free home was a falling-down hovel\u2014but just as I was running for my life, a baby was abandoned on Doc\u2019s porch and I stayed a while.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI became attached in no time. Then I fell in love with Jack. Now I\u2019m committed. Medicine here is a whole new scene from what I was used to in the city. It\u2019s like taking care of family. These people are my friends. And of course, if Jack is here, I\u2019m here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut what\u2019s it like doctoring here?\u201d Cameron asked.</p><p>\u201cWe have to be inventive and flexible. Boy,\u201d she said, laughing, \u201cwe could sure use a pediatrician, couldn\u2019t we, Shelby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoy howdie, as Mel would say. The babies are flowing into this town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like our chances of getting a new doctor, and I\u2019ll be honest\u2014I lose a lot of sleep over that. I don\u2019t want to be their only resource if something big happens, like a bad MVA,\u201d Mel said. \u201cSorry, Shelby,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s a motor vehicle accident.\u201d Looking back at Cameron, she said, \u201cOr some hunting accident. But this is no place for a doctor to prosper financially. A lot of our patient fees come from services and produce from ranches, farms and vineyards. More food than I could ever eat, less cash than it takes to get by. I\u2019ve written a grant proposal to cover malpractice insurance. The county is covering mine\u2014they see the merits of having a certified midwife around here. And if you can believe it, Doc was never covered. Never sued, never covered. He always figured if someone got pissed off and put him out of business, so be it.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful that if a physician can be found, the county will step up. I\u2019ve been contacting medical schools\u2014offering a place for a brand-new family-practice resident to practice rural medicine\u2014he or she could intern here under John Stone or June Hudson. If you know anyone...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll talk it around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do when I lose Shelby.\u201d</p> <p>Cameron looked at the younger woman.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here temporarily,\u201d Shelby said. \u201cI cared for my mother who suffered from ALS for a long time and now, before I move on to my own nursing college, I\u2019m staying with my Uncle Walt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalt Booth?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. I\u2019m Vanni\u2019s cousin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom Bodega Bay,\u201d he said. \u201cYeah, your name was mentioned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding? You know them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was introduced,\u201d he said simply. \u201cNice people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can help Mel for a while longer, but I\u2019ve been sending out my applications. Nursing is kind of a natural progression for me, given my years as a caregiver. It\u2019s going to be hard,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been out of school and work for years.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut what you have done is extraordinary,\u201d Mel said, grabbing her hand.</p><p>\u201cGood luck with that,\u201d Cam said. \u201cSo Mel\u2014how are you getting by now? With the patients?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now, I send a lot of them to Grace Valley and sometimes either June Hudson or John Stone will spend a half day up here, taking patients,\u201d Mel said.</p><p>\u201cThis is a helluva nice place to live,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s gorgeous. But a person has to make a living. What are you doing here, besides offering condolences?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Paul and Vanni had a sick baby while they were in Grants Pass and Paul offered me a day on the river as payment for my services. Problem is, I didn\u2019t tell them I was coming, so I\u2019m not going to hold him to it. I thought I\u2019d see how you\u2019re doing and make a house call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard about Mattie\u2019s croup,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cFortunately, he did well on antibiotics, snapped right out of it. Any chance I could get a tour of your clinic?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou bet. It\u2019s a pretty functional little place,\u201d Mel said with a touch of pride. She stood up. \u201cRight this way, Doctor.\u201d The first thing she did was open the refrigerator and show him that they kept as much blood and plasma on hand as food, something he seemed to get a kick out of. Shelby returned to her paperwork in the kitchen while Mel showed Cameron the exam room and the treatment room. In Doc\u2019s old office there were some boxes stacked in the corner. \u201cPersonal items of Doc\u2019s,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sending that stuff back to his college library. Come on upstairs.\u201d</p><p>She showed him the only hospital room in town, the roomy bathroom and Doc\u2019s old bedroom, completely vacant and freshly painted. \u201cDoc\u2019s furniture was almost as old as he was,\u201d she said. \u201cI gave it away and will buy new. If we don\u2019t get a doctor, it\u2019ll make a decent place for me to sleep when we have a delivery here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice little operation,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cBut how do you make ends meet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s not too hard for me. Jack has income\u2014he\u2019s retired military and the bar won\u2019t make us rich, but it brings in money. I have savings and no longer draw a salary. The clinic is mine now, thanks to Doc\u2019s generosity in his trust. It\u2019s free and clear. The uninsured patients are almost always able to cover the cost of lab work, X-rays and drugs, and then we get a twenty-dollar bill here and there. Patients on subsistence\u2014welfare or Medicaid\u2014their fees are paid. People around here are very grateful and they do their best\u2014there\u2019s often cash in the Christmas card. The most important thing is we never lose money. And all the equipment is paid for. In fact, once Jack had the bar open, he gave Doc almost all his meals. Jack does that\u2014the forest-fire fighters, the police, the game warden or rangers, Jack serves them for free when they\u2019ve been working here. The sheriff\u2019s deputy and his boys drop by for a gratis meal now and then. We have a highway patrolman who visits. Anyone who serves the needs of the town gets served by Jack and Preacher.\u201d</p><p>Cameron laughed and shook his head. \u201cHow can they afford to do that?\u201d</p><p>Mel grinned. \u201cWhen the patients bring in produce as patient fees, it goes straight to Preacher\u2019s kitchen where we eat it later. The people in town don\u2019t just bring stuff when they\u2019re sick\u2014they bring what they can spare continually, sort of like keeping us on retainer. A bushel of apples, several quarts of berries, huge sack of tomatoes, bushel of green beans... Preacher bakes and cans and freezes and loves every second of it. A big patient fee could be as much as a half calf. Or a few months of cream. And besides, Jack has everything he needs, Cameron.\u201d Then she got a little more serious. \u201cThe first night I landed in this town, I saw Jack as the owner of a bar and restaurant. It didn\u2019t take me long to learn he\u2019s so much more than that. He does a little of everything, from car and truck repair to building. He never goes for supplies without checking with a half-dozen little old ladies or postpartum mothers to see what they need. And if I\u2019m delivering a baby\u2014Jack is up all night, in case I need something. I hate that he hunts, but when he hunts, we enjoy some of the best venison dishes you can imagine. And most of the fish served in the bar, he and Preacher and maybe even Mike catch in the river. It all evens out.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cThis is a very simple place, Cameron. Sometimes if feels more like a commune than a town. But Jack... Ask anyone\u2014 Jack is at the center of this town, taking care of the people here.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI bet if I ask, they\u2019ll say you are, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do my best. The women\u2014they\u2019re my specialty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t take you long to fall in love with the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s rewarding,\u201d she said. \u201cI took home a pretty nice paycheck from the hospital in L.A., and I had some very challenging work there, but L.A. is a damn expensive place to live. I\u2019m not sure I was further ahead with that big salary. As long as the clinic can feed me and cover the cost of my gas, it doesn\u2019t need to provide me with much else. And I feel a lot better about what I\u2019m doing here. These people really need me.\u201d</p><p>He just looked at her for a moment, silent. \u201cYou\u2019ve found your niche,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI have. I have everything.\u201d Then she laughed. \u201cExcept a doctor. I could sure use a doctor. It\u2019s a small town, but we need medical service.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think maybe I envy you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not surprised.\u201d She smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s a different kind of life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I can only imagine.\u201d He squeezed her arm. \u201cWell. I should check in at the Booth house. Let them know I\u2019m here. You having dinner at the bar tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m there at five. Just for an hour or so. It\u2019s waterfowl hunting now, so Jack stays late and I go home to put the kids to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you at five,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cAnd again, I\u2019m sorry for your loss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said, sticking out her hand. \u201cHe was a pain in the butt, but God, I miss him.\u201d</p><p>Cameron went out to the Booth household, but found no one was home. He looked first in the stable, then drove out to the house under construction. There was a lot of activity around it, so he walked up the plank that led through the front door and found Paul in the center of the great room, hands on his hips, looking around the nearly finished room. \u201cHey,\u201d Cameron said.</p><p>Paul turned. \u201cCam! What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a couple of days and really felt the need to express my condolences to Mel. I realize I didn\u2019t give you any notice, so I don\u2019t intend to hold you to that offer of fishing.\u201d</p><p>Paul stuck out his hand. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. I can snag a morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, don\u2019t worry about it, plenty of time for us to go fishing. I have to talk to you about something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, pal. What\u2019s on your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m about to do something pretty crazy. And I can\u2019t do that unless you\u2019re real clear\u2014this has nothing to do with Vanessa.\u201d</p><p>The children were napping in the clinic, Shelby was at the bar getting a soda and Mel was sitting on the front-porch steps when Bruce brought the mail. \u201cAny specimens for Valley Hospital today?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d she said, leafing through the mail.</p><p>\u201cGreat. I get to knock off early. Have a nice day.\u201d</p><p>Mel stood, pulled her sweater tighter around her and walked inside. The sun was out today, but it was getting darn cold. She found an envelope from Cameron Michaels and tore it open. Her first thought was that he was such a class act\u2014it was probably a letter of condolence or a thank-you note. She pulled out a couple of pages, stapled together. At the top, in italics, it read: R\u00e9sum\u00e9 for Cameron Michaels, M.D., ABFM, ABP. Her mouth hung open.</p><p>She read through his credentials. He was board certified in family medicine and pediatrics with years of experience\u2014a dream doctor. Her mouth hadn\u2019t quite closed when she picked up the phone and dialed his office in Grants Pass. When he said hello, she said, \u201cHave you lost your mind?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He laughed. \u201cProbably. But just so you know I\u2019m not completely insane, I thought I\u2019d give you a year. I\u2019ll know in a few months if it\u2019s working for me, so I won\u2019t leave you high and dry. I\u2019ve taken a leave from my practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Cameron, don\u2019t you have a home there? Attachments?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate that house\u2014it\u2019s already on the market. If I come back here, I\u2019ll be looking for something much different.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut what about friends? Family? Special... You know... Cameron, isn\u2019t there a woman in your life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing to hold me here, Mel. And I can bring my own bedroom furniture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve talked about the pay...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat really isn\u2019t my first concern. I\u2019ll live at the clinic, take my meals at the bar, and I know you\u2019ll be fair with the salary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly crap,\u201d she said. \u201cIs this really happening?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cListen, Mel, I need a change. A temporary if not permanent one. If you find me qualified, I\u2019ll see you right after Christmas.\u201d</p><p>She was speechless for a minute. Then she said, \u201cHo-ho-ho.\u201d And he laughed.</p><p>Eleven</p><p>The cold and windy days of November made way for an unseasonably warm, clear Saturday with a bright sun\u2014a perfect day for Luke to work on the outside of his house or cabins. Or a perfect day for something else.</p><p>He put on his leather chaps, donned a well-worn leather bombardier\u2019s jacket over his sweater and checked on Art to be sure he had enough to do to keep him busy most of the day. Shelby should be getting a day off from the clinic. It was still early when he took his Harley down the road to the general\u2019s house. He went to the door with the rider\u2019s helmet in his hand. Shelby answered in her jeans and sweater, stocking feet, hair loose. \u201cWanna try my ride for a change?\u201d he asked her. \u201cIt\u2019s not too cold today.\u201d</p><p>She looked around him. \u201cOn that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust you and me, Shelby. Want to take a chance?\u201d</p><p>She gave him a soft smile. \u201cAm I safe with you on that thing?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He presented the rider\u2019s helmet. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll drive carefully. You should get a jacket and something to wrap around your neck. Boots and gloves. And you might want to tie up your hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not,\u201d she said. \u201cCome in while I get ready.\u201d</p><p>He stepped into the house and looked around, impressed. The general had done a good job remodeling this place for his retirement. He heard a baby fussing down the hall in the direction Shelby had gone. Luke walked across the great room to the large picture window and looked across the general\u2019s land. The horses were in the corral and not too far in the distance was the home under construction that Paul was building for himself and his wife. There was still a lot of construction mess around the building, but it looked close to finished from the outside. He also saw what looked like a gravestone atop a small rise not far from the stable. He had no idea what that was about.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Luke.\u201d</p><p>He turned to see Vanessa behind him, baby on her hip. \u201cHey,\u201d he said. \u201cLooks like the house is coming along great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be in before Christmas, hopefully. You should come out and take a look at it sometime. Paul\u2019s a genius.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your place coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than I expected,\u201d he answered. \u201cI\u2019m taking Shelby out for a ride on the Harley. The general will be okay with that, won\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShelby\u2019s a big girl,\u201d Vanessa said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cReady,\u201d Shelby said, popping into the room. She had put on a tan suede jacket with fringe on the underside of the arms, fringe that would slap in the wind. \u201cThis will be warm enough, won\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her; she was so damn pretty. \u201cYou should be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea when I\u2019ll be back,\u201d she told Vanessa. \u201cI hope no one needs me for anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been working so hard, just go. Enjoy yourself,\u201d Vanni said. \u201cAnd be careful on that thing.\u201d</p><p>She has no idea how right she is to warn Shelby, Luke thought. The danger is not on the motorcycle.</p><p>Shelby tucked her braid into the helmet and climbed on behind him. She wrapped her arms around his waist and off they went, down the road toward the highway and up through the redwoods. It was cold back in the tallest trees, but when they broke through, he drove into the sunny foothills, up on some of the craggy knolls where sheep grazed. The bike always made Luke feel exhilarated; the cold wind on his face refreshed and energized him.</p><p>Luke liked the feeling of her small arms holding him; a cross-country ride with those arms around him was definitely better than one alone. Sometimes she laid her head against his back while he drove them into the country, past the vineyards that lay fallow in winter, past orchards naked of their fruit. The hills were brown now, but in spring this place would come alive in stunning green. When the weather warmed, he\u2019d like to take her to the coast and across the craggy headlands above the ocean. Would she be here in the spring? he found himself wondering. Would he?</p><p>They had been riding for a little over an hour when he took the bike up a dirt road that wound around a small hill where livestock grazed. He parked the Harley there, swung his leg over and raised it on the stand. He pulled off his helmet and reached for hers. She took it off and her braid tumbled down her back. Putting one helmet on each of the two handlebars, he mounted the stationary bike backward to face her. Her cheeks were flushed from the cold wind and her eyes glowed. He reached his hands behind her knees and pulled her toward him, draping her legs over his thighs. Then, with his arms around her waist, he leaned toward her, pressing his lips softly to hers. She leaned into his kiss, opening her lips for him at once, so trusting. Besides a few stolen kisses outside Jack\u2019s, they had had little contact lately. The demands on Shelby\u2019s time had been heavy since Doc\u2019s death.</p><p>\u201cHow do you like the bike, Shelby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love it,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou like to go fast?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI\u2019ve always been so cautious,\u201d she said. \u201cIt feels good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been trying not to take you too fast,\u201d he said, and his voice had gone husky, like brushed velvet. He ran a hand down her back, down her long braid. He pulled her mouth against his and, with a big hand against the back of her head, he kissed her more thoroughly. She melted to him, her arms going inside his jacket and round to his back, holding him closer, her small tongue slipping into his mouth. His world tilted. He probed inside her mouth in a strong kiss, pulling her more tightly against him, until she was straddling his lap. He filled his hands with her butt and held her tight, feasting on her sighs and moans. He rocked her pelvis against him and he became aroused instantly. If they didn\u2019t have the barrier of jeans between them, this thing he\u2019d been trying to talk himself out of would be done. \u201cAw, Shelby,\u201d he whispered against her lips. He released her mouth. \u201cListen, we have to talk.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cSure. I\u2019ve been expecting this. The talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShelby, you should run for your life, I\u2019m not kidding. I\u2019ve never been reliable where women are concerned. And I\u2019m not real well fixed with brakes, either. God, I really don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to scare me again, Luke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m trying to scare you. Warn you. Use your head, Shelby. You\u2019re young, you\u2019re sweet, and I\u2019m just an irresponsible, horny bastard. You\u2019d be making a mistake, getting mixed up with me.\u201d</p><p>She traced his ear with a finger. \u201cWell, Luke, I\u2019m already a little mixed up with you. And you got yourself mixed up with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShelby, I\u2019m temporary at best. I\u2019m not staying here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, neither. Is that it?\u201d</p><p>He sighed and shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve been known to run through women like sharks run through scuba divers. I wouldn\u2019t be good for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sleeping with a lot of women right now?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t been with a woman in so long, he had a hard time remembering the last one. That fact alone made him even more vulnerable to Shelby\u2019s incredibly seductive charm. \u201cThere has been only one woman on my mind. My brain is like a frickin\u2019 missile and if you don\u2019t move out of the target, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to end up doing some things you might hate me for later. And then your Uncle Walt is going to shoot me.\u201d</p><p>It only made her chuckle. \u201cDo you always warn your women not to get involved with you before you swoop down and devour them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever. That could keep me from getting laid. But I worry about you. You need to fall in love, I can smell it on you. And I don\u2019t fall in love. I don\u2019t put down roots and I don\u2019t make commitments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know something, Luke?\u201d she asked, smiling. \u201cI think maybe you\u2019re more worried you might fall in love with me than the other way around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, you shouldn\u2019t think like that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just said maybe. It\u2019s not like I expect it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to travel and go to school. You\u2019re going to fix up your cabins and sell them. You\u2019ve been very clear. You\u2019ve warned me a hundred times. And now, I\u2019m just warning you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want a fling? With a guy like me? Who\u2019s too old for you?\u201d</p><p>She just laughed and he wanted to shake her. \u201cYou are pretty old,\u201d she said. \u201cPretty soon, all these long warnings won\u2019t even be necessary.\u201d She tilted her head back and laughed.</p><p>His hands on her fanny, he pulled her against him and rocked her gently. He looked into her eyes and his were as hot as pokers.</p><p>\u201cOh. Apparently, you\u2019re not too old yet,\u201d she said, leaning toward his mouth for another kiss, drawing a deep, miserable groan from him.</p><p>\u201cYou should take this a lot more seriously. My track record isn\u2019t good. I\u2019ve been with a lot of women, and never for long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Luke. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re very dangerous,\u201d she said, but her voice was filled with humor. \u201cI just can\u2019t find it in me to discourage you. I love the way you kiss me.\u201d She moved her pelvis against his. \u201cAnd this...? Hmm. I don\u2019t know what to make of this.\u201d</p><p>He swooped over her mouth again, with heat and power. Again, her arms went around him. The taste of her mouth was so delicious it almost sent him reeling out of this world. For all his talk about his many women and his failure to make anything stick, he couldn\u2019t remember feeling a rush like this with anyone. He\u2019d been turned on before, stirred up almost to the breaking point, but this thing that was happening to him with Shelby was so intense, it was just about driving him out of his mind. He hung on for dear life, devouring her mouth for two minutes, then four, the sensation of her firm young breasts boring into his chest even through his sweater was getting him high.</p><p>She met him all the way, holding him, purring softly against his mouth, joining in his tongue play, sending thrill after thrill vibrating through him. All trepidation and shyness on her part was gone. He was getting damn uncomfortable. Still, he kissed her a while longer.</p><p>\u201cDammit, Shelby,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd warned me and warned me and warned me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be with a serious young man who will protect you and take care of you, not someone like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe someday. Right now, I just have one requirement. One woman at a time, that\u2019s all I ask. I\u2019m not looking to join a harem. Can you do that?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI\u2019m doing it. I don\u2019t even have to try. You\u2019re the only woman I want. And I\u2019m starting to want you real damn bad.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind that, you know,\u201d she said, gently trailing the backs of her fingers along his rough cheek.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better think about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t thought about anything else. And you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, running his hand over her shoulder and down to her hand, lacing his fingers in hers. \u201cHere are your choices. Try to be smart. I can take you home now, or take you home with me. Because we either have to stop this here and now, or get it done.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him. She leaned toward him and pressed her lips softly against his. \u201cLet\u2019s get it done,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Luke pulled the bike up in front of his house, dismounted and put it up on its stand. He took her helmet from her and hung it on the handlebar. Then he put his lips against hers as he lifted her off the bike and into his arms. He carried her inside, threw the latch and moved quickly and impatiently toward the bedroom.</p><p>His brain was numb; all he could think was that soon he would be cured. Once he had her, he\u2019d be over the insanity. But in spite of his desperation, he was determined that it wasn\u2019t going to be too fast. It was going to be slow and sweet and he was going to make her feel so good, she\u2019d faint. Then he\u2019d be cured.</p><p>He sat her gently on the bed. He let his jacket drop from his shoulders and took hers, tossing them into the chair in his room. He unfastened his chaps and drew off his boots. Kneeling on the floor in front of her, he slowly pulled off her boots and carefully drew her sweater over her head, placing small kisses on her chest, shoulders, breast, neck. She trembled and he pulled her into his arms for a moment, reminding himself to take his time, take it slow, reassure her that he wasn\u2019t going to be the shark right now.</p><p>Her bra disappeared and his tongue brought her nipples to life, hardening them into peaks. He gently pushed her back onto the bed and unsnapped her jeans, giving them a tug. She lifted her fanny to give assist and they slid down and off. He was left to view an incredible body, naked but for a tiny, transparent wisp of sheer fabric that barely covered her below the waist. He ran a finger slowly under the elastic.</p><p>He made fast work of his own clothes, getting down to his boxers. Leaning over her, he began to place kisses all over her body, from her neck to her knees. Then he slid over her, his thighs on her thighs, chest to breasts, devouring her mouth. He heard her moan, felt her arch toward him, and his erection was throbbing against her belly. He nibbled at her lips and said, \u201cYou have about ten seconds to change your mind.\u201d He looked into her soft, hazel eyes and saw her give a small smile and shake her head. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d he asked, wondering what the hell he would do if she tried to stop him now. He was like a runaway train, the blood roaring in his brain.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a condom, Luke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on that,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>He ditched the boxers and grabbed a condom from the nightstand. He thought abstractly that it was strange he kept them there when he never brought women home. He had never liked having women in his nest. But Shelby was here, and it seemed perfectly natural. He had the condom on in record time, but his hands on her were slow. He tugged off that tiny wisp of lace; he thought he heard a tear as he was getting it off. He might owe her a pair of panties. Running a hand down her belly, over her pubis and lower, he nudged her legs apart and massaged her, paying special attention to the small, erogenous knot in the middle, a contact that caused her to moan and push against his hand. He let his fingers move lower and dip in, finding her wet and ready to go. And he was ready to give her the ride of her life.</p><p>Easy, he told himself. It has to be good for her. He held himself over her and gently probed, pressing himself toward her. He found the path and moved farther as she lifted her hips up, but he met with resistance. He pushed a little, gently, but she was tight. Maybe he hadn\u2019t taken enough time getting her ready for this. He looked into her eyes and brushed back her hair. \u201cHoney, you\u2019re awful small.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t okay; he spent a little more time stimulating her while he kissed her, making sure she was slick and aroused. He wasn\u2019t sliding in even though she was ready. He didn\u2019t want to force it. There shouldn\u2019t be any discomfort with this. It should all be good.</p><p>She put her palm against his cheek. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Luke. Just do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s not right,\u201d he said, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the first time,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Instinctively, he drew back. It almost deflated him, he was so stunned. \u201cThat\u2019s not possible,\u201d he said in a breath. \u201cYou\u2019re twenty-five!\u201d But she only nodded her head, letting her eyes gently close. When she did that, she squeezed out a couple of tears that ran into the hair at her temples and it tore at his heart. How does a woman this beautiful, this sexy, remain a virgin? was all he could think.</p><p>He found himself gently kissing those tears. \u201cAw, Shelby. This isn\u2019t good.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she whispered again. \u201cIt\u2019s time. I want it to be you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I already made you cry and I haven\u2019t even done anything yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke, I swear, I\u2019m ready,\u201d she said. She reached a small hand down between their bodies and took hold of him, causing him to inhale sharply. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting a long time for this to happen. Please don\u2019t make me wait any longer.\u201d</p><p>On the upside, news that she was intact held the advantage of helping him slow down. Way down. In fact, it nearly rendered him incapable of proceeding. But he was mad for her and decided to explore the explanations later and for now, take good care of her. \u201cOkay, baby,\u201d he said, placing soft kisses on her lips. \u201cI\u2019m going to make this all right. I\u2019ll try to make it nice for you. Trust me and let me do the work, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she answered.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t exactly an expert on the female body, but he knew one or two things. He wasn\u2019t going to get inside her without pain unless she was real soft and loose, and there was only one way to ensure that. He kissed his way down her body until he got to the center and once there, he worked that erogenous spot with his tongue. He groaned in pleasure; she was sweet, intoxicating. Her hands gripped his shoulders as she squirmed beneath him, making small noises that convinced him he was on the right track. He slid his hands up her ribs to her breasts and gently kneaded them, softly running his thumbs over her nipples. Her sighs became pants, which became little cries, and he buried himself in her until he felt the quivering turn to clenching spasms. She dug her fingers into his shoulders and clamped her knees against him, locking him there while she reached a powerful orgasm that seemed to hold on to her forever. He didn\u2019t move until it finally set her free and she collapsed beneath him.</p><p>Then he rose slowly, a bit reluctantly, kissing his way up her body until he reached her lips. \u201cBetter,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cI want the rest,\u201d she begged breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting there, sweetheart. We need to take a little time with this.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a few moments of gentle kisses before letting his fingers wander south. What he hadn\u2019t expected was for his whole objective to change, from dying to get inside her to free himself of the insatiable craving, to wanting to make this memorable for her, do right by her, especially if this was, insanely, her first time. He found what he knew he would between her legs\u2014her tissues were plump, soft, damp and loose.</p><p>When he sensed she had mostly recovered, he let his fingers work that precious little knot, getting her stirred up all over again. When she started to make eager noises and move against his hand, losing herself in the sensations, he gently positioned himself to slowly enter her. He rose above her and watched her face, prepared to stop the second she winced or gasped or showed signs of discomfort. No way he could hurt her. There was still some resistance, but not nearly what he had felt before. A woman\u2019s body was miraculous; nothing like a thundering climax to open her up. He moved carefully, just a little bit at a time, until he made his way inside, filling her. He was still, letting her get used to the sensation of having him inside her, and soon he saw her slow, satisfied smile shape her lips.</p><p>\u201cYou should have told me,\u201d he said between soft kisses.</p><p>\u201cYou would have run for your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might have been better prepared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt turns out you were prepared enough. And I want to know about this. I want you to show me.\u201d</p><p>He began to move, deep, slow, even strokes, watching her face, taking pleasure in her sweet smile. He reached down and pulled her legs up, bending them at the knees, then his hands went to her hips. \u201cMove your hips a little, honey. Help me find the right spot. We have to find it together....\u201d</p><p>He kissed that gasping mouth, again and again. She moved around a little, then suddenly she threw her head back and muttered, \u201cOh God, oh God, oh God, oh God.\u201d</p><p>He smiled down into her eyes. \u201cThere you go,\u201d he whispered. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about. The love spot,\u201d he said against her lips. He matched his movements to hers, apace with her. He chuckled, a deep lusty sound. \u201cThat\u2019s my girl. You know what you want, don\u2019t you, baby?\u201d he asked her in a hoarse whisper.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cOh, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered. \u201cOh God...\u201d</p><p>Soon the little murmurs once again became more passionate and his strokes faster and deeper. The tempo increased and her hips lunged toward him until finally she lifted her pelvis against him, instinctively digging her heels into the bed for traction to push against him and the storm took her on another frenzied ride. She froze, gasped and closed around him with a heat so intense and power so strong, his brain froze. Again, it held her in its grip for a long, wondrous moment, a pleasure so blinding and spasms so fierce that they pulled his climax out of him. He thought he might lose his mind, it was so good. He\u2019d never felt anything quite like it.</p><p>\u201cOh! Luke!\u201d she cried in a passionate whisper. The sound of his name on her lips made his experience even more incredible.</p><p>And then she drifted slowly back to reality in his arms, and he found this to be the most tender part. He held her, ran his hand over her soft, perfect body in long, slow caresses while she caught her breath and calmed.</p><p>Something happened to him. The tension was gone, the physical relief was welcome, but he wasn\u2019t completely satisfied. He didn\u2019t want to leave her body. He found himself thinking, I\u2019m in a place no one has ever been, and it\u2019s the sweetest place imaginable. The thing he usually did to prove he knew how to treat a woman right, holding her for a long, precious moment after the lovemaking, he was doing now because he simply couldn\u2019t let her go. When he thought about her leaving his bed, it made him feel empty inside. Holding her, kissing her, touching her, felt right. Perfect and normal.</p><p>At long last she let out a deep, satisfied sigh.</p><p>Reluctantly, he let himself slip out of her body. He braced his head on a raised hand and looked down at her, idly toying with the hair at her temple. \u201cWas that everything you thought it would be?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, man,\u201d she said, her voice quivering with a small laugh. \u201cNow I know what the girls have been talking about. It\u2019s even better than I imagined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, even if I can believe you haven\u2019t had sex before, it\u2019s going to be damn hard to convince me you\u2019ve never had any kind of orgasm. I started having mine at twelve, all by myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been there. But there\u2019s a definite difference between that and this. Whew.\u201d</p><p>His lips found her neck, shoulder, ear. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to help me understand this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not interesting, Luke. You already know, if you think about it. My mom. She got sick when I was eighteen. I never left her for long.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI got out a little with friends, but I never got involved with any guys. I even had some dates, some very dull dates. The last couple of years were all about helping my mom to the end.\u201d She touched the short hair over his ear. \u201cI\u2019m a late bloomer, huh?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He looked down at her, shaking his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know how it\u2019s possible. Is everyone in Bodega Bay blind? You just about sent me into a coma the first night I saw you. They should\u2019ve been beating down the door...\u201d</p><p>She stroked his face. \u201cThis is a whole new world for me, Luke. To have this kind of freedom. To think about myself. To flirt with a man.\u201d She smiled. \u201cA dangerous man.\u201d Then her smile faded. \u201cSomething like this couldn\u2019t have happened while I worried whether my mom was okay at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is new territory for me, Shelby. I never would have planned this.\u201d</p> <p>She grinned. \u201cIs that so? I suspected that, which is why I decided not to mention it. Until it was too late for you to turn back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get into things like this. There are a hundred reasons why I shouldn\u2019t be in bed, naked, with you right now.\u201d He pressed a soft kiss to her temple. \u201cA hundred and one, now that I know you\u2019re a virgin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas,\u201d she corrected. \u201cNo one had ever been inside me, and you\u2019re... Shew.\u201d She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m what?\u201d he asked, running a hand along the hair over her ear.</p><p>She laughed softly. \u201cI admit I don\u2019t know much about men, but I suspect you\u2019re a little more blessed than the average guy. Plus, you\u2019re amazing. I\u2019ve always heard the first time is uncomfortable.\u201d She smiled. \u201cThat was great.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think if I\u2019d known, I would have moved away. Left town for good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really glad you didn\u2019t. It was perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was pretty perfect. But damn, girl. I\u2019ve never done that before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thirty-eight. You\u2019re the first virgin I\u2019ve ever been with. Why did you cry?\u201d</p><p>She dropped her lids. \u201cIt\u2019s a little embarrassing, being this old and...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAw, baby,\u201d he said, kissing her closed eyes. \u201cIt was sweet. Sweeter than anything I\u2019ve ever experienced.\u201d</p><p>He rolled onto his back, looking at the ceiling. Crazy thoughts began filling his head, chief among them was that he couldn\u2019t imagine there ever being another man in her life, in her body. He\u2019d never had such possessive, proprietary feelings. He wasn\u2019t sure if this was because it was Shelby, or because she\u2019d never been touched inside until he claimed her. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you,\u201d he said. \u201cIt shakes me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed,\u201d she said with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious, Shelby. I\u2019m wanting you again. I don\u2019t want you to leave this bed.\u201d</p><p>She rolled over onto her stomach and raised herself up on her elbows. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to go home eventually. Before there\u2019s a search party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will shoot anyone who touches that door,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t move. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d He slipped off the bed and headed for the bathroom to get rid of the condom.</p><p>As he walked back into the room, she got her first sight of a naked man in full form. She smiled. He was so beautiful. It was so awesome to have a gorgeous, lusty man walk toward her. He stretched out beside her, pulling her against him again, placing a gentle palm over her soft mound. \u201cHow does it feel? Down here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLush,\u201d she said, snuggling closer.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a little blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. No surprise. Nothing to worry about,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAre you sore?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. She felt him against her thigh. Growing. \u201cAm I going to be able to walk out of here?\u201d she asked, humor in her voice.</p><p>He covered her lips with his. \u201cNot soon,\u201d he whispered. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m going to be good to you.\u201d</p><p>Luke took her home in the truck. The motorcycle would have been too hard on her tender parts. When he pulled up in front of the general\u2019s house, she leaned toward him. He cradled her jaw in his big hand and pulled her lips to his. They were all going to know. Her face was branded with his love. Her cheeks were aglow, chafed from his beard. Her lips were bruised bright pink from hours of kissing and the look in her eyes reflected a whole afternoon of the finest love he\u2019d ever made. \u201cYou should hide all the guns and sharp objects,\u201d he whispered against her mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou worry too much,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m an adult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen am I going to see you again?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cSoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to keep you flat on your back for a month.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him. \u201cLuke, don\u2019t ever let anyone tell you you\u2019re not romantic.\u201d She gave him a peck on the lips and got out of the truck to go inside.</p><p>No one seemed to be around, which suited her. She really didn\u2019t feel like walking into dinner in progress with Vanni, Paul and Uncle Walt. In fact, there was no activity in the kitchen and she wondered if everyone had gone to Jack\u2019s. She went to her room, pulled off her jacket and boots and flopped on the bed. She stared at the ceiling dreamily. After about ten minutes, she heard a door open down the hall. Vanessa, looking sleepy, peeked into Shelby\u2019s room. \u201cI thought I heard someone come home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think anyone was here,\u201d Shelby said.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Vanni said through a yawn. \u201cMatt\u2019s having an extra-long nap and I kind of shared it with him.\u201d She rubbed her eyes, then looked at Shelby. \u201cOooohh,\u201d she said. \u201cIt happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd happened and happened and happened,\u201d Shelby said and laughed as she kicked her legs on the bed.</p><p>Vanni came into the room and sat on the side of her bed. \u201cWelcome aboard,\u201d she said with a soft smile. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I\u2019ve had sex all afternoon with a brand-spanking-new vagina. I might have to take a long soak in the tub.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndescribable. Like I\u2019ve never really been alive before today. Vanni, he was so good to me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t falling in love with him, are you?\u201d Vanni asked. \u201cBecause I get a sense about Luke, that he might go a little hard on the heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he gave me that talk. He doesn\u2019t like to commit or get tied down.\u201d She laughed again. \u201cThe least of my worries,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOh, baby, see\u2014I was afraid of that. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re up to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanted me to be a virgin forever? If he makes me cry, I\u2019ll get over it, but I have to tell you, he doesn\u2019t treat me like a man who\u2019s going to break my heart. Besides, if he does, haven\u2019t you and I already been through way worse and recovered?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we sure have,\u201d Vanni said. \u201cHe treated you right, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone and ruin his reputation, but he\u2019s the sweetest man I\u2019ve ever known. He\u2019s afraid Uncle Walt is going to shoot him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy sure worries the boys.\u201d Vanni laughed, remembering when Paul was afraid of the same thing.</p><p>\u201cWhere is everyone?\u201d Shelby asked.</p><p>\u201cPaul\u2019s not home from work yet and I don\u2019t know where Daddy is. I\u2019m thinking of starting dinner. Have any ideas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said, sitting up. \u201cI\u2019m going to soak in the tub for an hour, and then I\u2019m going back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it. I just have to. You and Paul are great company, but I want to be next to that man.\u201d She grinned. \u201cYou think Uncle Walt will have a fit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, he may not even be home himself,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty savvy about this kind of thing. He didn\u2019t say too much when Paul was sneaking down the hall into my room. You slip out if you want to. I\u2019ll handle the home team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Vanni,\u201d she said.</p><p>She had to go back. Not for more sex; she couldn\u2019t take any more. She wanted to know how he\u2019d receive her. Would she be welcome? Was he done with her now, at least for today? She had many curiosities about his world\u2014he warned her not to count on him, then treated her like a queen. He hadn\u2019t promised to love her, but he said such tender, lovely things to her\u2014that she was beautiful, that he\u2019d never had a sweeter experience, that he didn\u2019t want her to leave. Could he say those things and not care?</p><p>After a long soak, she went to the kitchen where Vanni was at the stove and Matt was in his high chair. Paul sat at the kitchen table with the newspaper spread in front of him. He was still in his dusty work clothes; she\u2019d been tying up the bathroom. He looked up at her and his smile of greeting changed slowly into a look of surprised recognition, his mouth open slightly. She must be beaming.</p><p>She poked through the wine rack and pulled out a bottle. \u201cThink Uncle Walt can part with this?\u201d she asked Vanni.</p><p>\u201cSure. Take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t wait up,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cShelby,\u201d Paul said. He stood up from the table and went to her, draping an arm around her shoulders. \u201cYou know if you need anything, anything at all, you can call me.\u201d He dropped a kiss on her brow.</p><p>\u201cWow. There aren\u2019t many secrets around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one said anything,\u201d Paul said. \u201cNo one had to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid anyone warn Vanni when you were sneaking into her bed at night?\u201d she asked softly. \u201cPaul, he\u2019s wonderful, but I\u2019m not naive. I understand what kind of man he is.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cRight now, he\u2019s what I want. And he\u2019s very good to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d better be. You can tell him, if he isn\u2019t, he\u2019ll answer to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to have to tell him that.\u201d She rose on her toes and kissed his cheek. \u201cNow let me be. I have a man in my life. At last.\u201d Maybe not for long, she reminded herself. But at the moment\u2014a good man.</p><p>Okay, the joke\u2019s on me, Luke thought.</p><p>Shelby had left his bed and he\u2019d taken her home at about four o\u2019clock and he had hated it. He was not nearly ready to let her go. Far from cured of her, he wanted her more than ever. And not just her body, all of her\u2014her sweet laugh, her soft mane of hair, her gentle and secure way of dealing with him and everything else in her life. He had warned himself not to get involved with someone so innocent and it had turned out he was the innocent\u2014not prepared to feel such a rush of emotion. Every time he remembered her voice whispering, \u201cShow me, Luke. I want to learn what makes you feel good,\u201d it sent a ripple of desire shooting through him that almost overpowered him, leaving him weak in the knees.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t gone to Jack\u2019s for his beer tonight. He didn\u2019t feel like being around anyone, unless it was Shelby. Right now when he thought of her, his eyes steamed with lust. He felt electric shocks soar through his whole body. He couldn\u2019t be in the same room with her and keep his hands to himself. So he\u2019d stayed home to feel those things in private, undistracted.</p><p>He went to Art\u2019s cabin and helped him fix some chicken and dumplings with vegetables out of a can. They talked for a while about what they\u2019d do around the cabins in the morning, then Luke went back to the house. He made himself a sandwich, drank a beer, took a shower, content to be alone. His mind was whirring with the memory of holding her, touching her silky skin, feeling her warm, fragrant breath against his chest. He could still smell her, taste her, even after the beer.</p><p>He had never felt like this before in his life. Never.</p><p>Wearing just a pair of jeans, no shoes or shirt, he sat on the sofa in his small living room in front of the fire, feet up on the ottoman, holding a beer by the neck of the bottle, thinking of nothing but her awesome body, her luscious lips, and all too often, the way he felt inside her. Had he warned her to be careful of him, that he was a heartbreaker? Jesus, he was an idiot was what he was. Thinking there would never be a woman he\u2019d want to hang on to. Thinking he\u2019d take his taste and move on. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He heard an engine and headlights bounced through the front window. He stood up, holding his breath. For a moment he was sure Walt had come for him; come to work him over for touching Shelby. He heard a soft knock at the door. When he opened it, she stood there, a backpack slung over one shoulder and that alluring smile on her lips. He felt his chest expand in ways he didn\u2019t recognize and knew that his eyes had grown molten and dark.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here,\u201d she said.</p><p>He opened his arms and she stepped into his embrace. \u201cWhere did you think I\u2019d be?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She looked up at him. \u201cOut for the evening? Prowling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, you worked all the prowl out of me this afternoon.\u201d He pushed the door closed without letting go of her.</p><p>\u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t have come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I might\u2019ve had a little too much of a good thing. I\u2019m spotting and I\u2019m sore,\u201d she said.</p> <p>He ran a hand across her cheek, lifted her chin and placed a soft kiss on her lips. \u201cI\u2019ll just hold you. We wouldn\u2019t want to do any damage. I\u2019m sorry if I made you sore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t so much you as the newness, Luke. You were careful. But I just wanted to feel your arms around me some more.\u201d She laughed and buried her face in his chest. \u201cI wanted to smell your chest.\u201d</p><p>A deep sigh escaped him and he tightened his arms. He was just beginning to admit it to himself\u2014he was in love with her. Totally gone. \u201cWhere does your family think you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith you. For the night, if you want me to stay.\u201d</p><p>He held her away from him and frowned. \u201cYou told them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that all right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t care who knows\u2014but what about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have to tell anyone,\u201d she said. \u201cPaul and Vanni took one look at me and told me to be careful. They all think I\u2019m so fragile and you\u2019re a rogue. I\u2019m not.\u201d She smiled. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>He pulled the backpack off her shoulder and put it on the breakfast bar. \u201cI was hard on you earlier, Shelby. Trying to push you away, trying to scare you. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cLuke, I had made up my mind. Couldn\u2019t you tell?\u201d</p><p>It was just beginning to dawn on him. \u201cWhen did you decide?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cNot right away. I had to get to know you a little. And\u2014\u201d she laughed \u201c\u2014there was that tool belt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had a job for me to do, didn\u2019t you, Shelby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d She smiled. \u201cIt had to be someone irresistible and experienced.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSometimes I don\u2019t think. I can be insensitive. Careless with feelings,\u201d he said. \u201cWeren\u2019t you afraid I might hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for one second,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cI brought a bottle of wine...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll open it for you, pour you a glass and finish my beer.\u201d He took her jacket, hung it on the back of a chair and started to unbutton her shirt. \u201cLet\u2019s get into bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not kidding,\u201d she said. \u201cI may have overdone it. See, I shouldn\u2019t have come...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to feel you against me. I just want to touch you a little. I\u2019m not going to do anything that will make you sore. I want to get you better.\u201d He kissed that delicious mouth. \u201cYou might need a few days, but I don\u2019t want to be away from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut won\u2019t that just make it too tempting? Naked in the bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. You\u2019re important to me. I\u2019m going to take good care of you.\u201d He opened her shirt and lowered his lips to her breast.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d she said in a breath. \u201cIt might be too tempting for me.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his head and smiled into her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, honey. I know how to take care of that.\u201d He turned her toward the bedroom. \u201cI\u2019ll bring you a glass of wine.\u201d</p><p>Luke was locked in an incredible dream, with ecstasy overpowering him. His entire body was quivering wildly, madly, as the woman in his dream worked on him. He was close, ready to let himself go in a climax so huge it would rock the bed. The sound of his own groan woke him and he realized it was not a dream. He looked down at that honey-colored head of hair and gasped. \u201cShelby!\u201d He reached down, grabbed her shoulders and pulled her up toward him. \u201cShelby, come here.\u201d He pulled her face up to his. \u201cHoney, what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurt me? Sweet Jesus!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never done that before, so I wasn\u2019t sure...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doing it now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve never slept with a man before and you were keeping me awake, poking me in the back.\u201d She smiled at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t hesitate to take care of me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShelby, do you realize what almost happened?\u201d</p><p>She smoothed her hands over his chest and gave his lips a little tug with hers. \u201cI\u2019m inexperienced, Luke, not ignorant.\u201d</p><p>He caught her to him, holding her close. \u201cAw, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas I awful? Maybe you should tell me what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwful?\u201d He laughed. \u201cI almost lost it in my sleep!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat means it was okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that. This is all so new for you...\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cTurns out it feels almost as good to please you as it does to be pleased by you.\u201d She gave him a little kiss. \u201cRelax.\u201d And she slid down his body. Her lips brushed against his belly and he shuddered involuntarily. His head dropped back and he groaned. In one day, his life had changed too much to comprehend. No way he could deserve this woman and her unselfish passions. In no time his world exploded and he saw stars. Then he felt tears in his eyes and knew it wasn\u2019t from the orgasm.</p><p>She slid up and lay atop his body. She pecked at his lips. \u201cI think you liked that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d he said, unable to catch his breath. \u201cI\u2019m dead, that\u2019s what. And against all odds, I was sent to heaven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat good, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot just that. Everything. I\u2019ve never had a day like this in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you had lots of days like this,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNever. Baby, never. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to wake up.\u201d He brought her mouth onto his and kissed her deeply, holding her tightly against him. He hadn\u2019t expected the most mind-blowing sex of his life and the sweetest woman on earth dishing it out.</p><p>\u201cAnd I think now I might be able to get a little sleep,\u201d she said with a soft laugh. Then, with her lips against his ear she whispered, \u201cLuke, thank you. You\u2019ve made it all so wonderful, so good. Hold me,\u201d she said. \u201cLet me fall asleep against you, in your arms.\u201d</p><p>He held her there, like that, stretched over his body, her head resting against his shoulder. She might weigh a hundred and ten pounds to his one-eighty, and she fit against his chest perfectly. He ran his hand down her back and over her soft bottom, stroking her, listening as her breathing evened out, as she sighed in her sleep.</p><p>This is the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to me, he thought. I hope I don\u2019t screw it up.</p><p>Twelve</p><p>Walt went to the stable in the early morning and found Shelby there, mucking out a stall. He jumped in surprise when he saw her. \u201cMorning,\u201d she said brightly.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you get here?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cNot that long ago. Maybe a half hour. It was such a beautiful morning, I decided to come right down here, see what I could get done. Then I\u2019ll shower off the stable and have some breakfast.\u201d</p><p>He stepped toward her, frowning. \u201cShelby, you weren\u2019t home last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean this morning, don\u2019t you? Because you weren\u2019t home last night, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShelby\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was with Luke. But just in case you wondered or were worried, I told Vanni where I was going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll night?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAll night,\u201d she said firmly, giving her chin a lift. He was quiet for a long time, looking at her from under those fierce, hooded brows. Finally she leaned on her shovel and met his eyes fearlessly, stare for stare. \u201cYou have something you want to say to me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go for a short ride...talk about some things...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to pass on the ride, Uncle Walt. I have some things I\u2019d like to do this morning. But we can take a few minutes for you to get this off your chest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where to start.\u201d His expression softened. \u201cShelby, honey\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalt,\u201d she said, purposely omitting the Uncle. \u201cLet me help you, because we\u2019re going to get this over with quickly. I like him. He\u2019s very nice to me. I haven\u2019t been impetuous\u2014I gave Luke a lot of thought. There\u2019s no question in my mind\u2014he\u2019s a good man. I know he comes off looking like a reckless tough guy, just like a lot of the men in this town at first glance, but he\u2019s not that way with me. He\u2019s very thoughtful and considerate. He\u2019s real worried about you, however.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t dislike the man. It\u2019s just that I don\u2019t know him real well. And I know a lot about men like Luke, I\u2019ve commanded hundreds of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean men like you and Luke\u2014soldiers. Men who fight battles, go to war, get a little roughed up, seem to manage on very little conscience...\u201d He hung his head briefly. \u201cYou can thank Vanni for already having this conversation with me\u2014about soldiers, how they\u2019re trained, how they live, that edgy, son-of-a-bitch personality they learn in the army. You have a little of that in you, too, don\u2019t you, Uncle Walt? Covering up your softer feelings? Being hard and resilient and not letting yourself feel guilty about the damage you have to inflict? I suppose it goes with the territory.\u201d She stepped closer to him. \u201cI spent a lot of years around you when I was growing up. I saw young G.I.s shake in their boots when you walked past them, but you always treated Aunt Peg and Vanni like precious jewels. And just like you, Luke has a sweet side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promised your mother I\u2019d look out for you, watch over you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so you are,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019d be more comfortable with me right now if I\u2019d stayed home and waited for some nice young man from church to come by the house and ask your permission to take me out for a buggy ride\u2014but it\u2019s not going to be like that, thank God. I was attracted to Luke Riordan almost right away. The attraction is mutual. I\u2019m having a romance, Uncle Walt. At last, I\u2019m having a romance. I\u2019m way overdue\u2014and you\u2019re not going to make me feel guilty or make him nervous. I appreciate your concern, but it\u2019s up to me.\u201d</p><p>Whew, Walt thought, resisting the urge to take a step backward. \u201cIf I\u2019m concerned, it\u2019s only because... Aw, honey\u2014I just want you to be happy... I don\u2019t want you to be hurt. You might be getting in over your head....\u201d</p><p>She took another step toward him, looking up at him. There was absolute conviction in her eyes. \u201cYou thought I\u2019d save myself for marriage?\u201d she asked, lifting one eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a lot of things, but I don\u2019t think anyone could accuse me of being foolish or old-fashioned.\u201d She just tilted her head, questioning him. \u201cOr impractical,\u201d he added grudgingly.</p><p>She laughed at him, though softly. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure Luke\u2019s going to hurt me,\u201d she said. \u201cRegardless, there isn\u2019t much anyone can do about that. I don\u2019t know if you can understand this, but I\u2019m glad that I can finally take my romantic lumps just like all the other girls have.\u201d She looked up at him earnestly. \u201cWhy does everyone think I\u2019m such a wuss? You think the last five years have been easy? You think it doesn\u2019t take a brave girl to spend the night with a man when my overprotective uncle might be at home, pacing, loading his shotgun? Believe me, even if Luke Riordan breaks my heart, it\u2019s going to be a lot easier in the end than some of the stuff I\u2019ve been through the last few years. This is a new adventure for me\u2014and you\u2019re not going to bully me out of it. Man, if anyone\u2019s earned the right, it\u2019s me!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd all your plans?\u201d he asked. \u201cTravel? School? A new life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s ridiculous to even ask,\u201d she said. \u201cWomen don\u2019t have to choose between a relationship and education, Uncle Walt. I don\u2019t have to give up anything.\u201d</p><p>Walt reached out a hand and lifted her thick braid off her shoulder, caressing it between his thumb and forefinger. \u201cI\u2019m not here to bully you, and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re a wuss. In fact, I think you\u2019re pretty tough stuff. I guess I need to assure myself you\u2019re wise to this. Sometimes these adventures can scar the heart.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of that,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be the first. Vanni said her heart was broken a hundred times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer mother handled most of that,\u201d Walt said with a shrug. \u201cYou\u2019re stuck with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a bad guy to be stuck with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust be careful.\u201d He reached out and touched her cheek softly. \u201cI keep forgetting how strong willed you are. Luke Riordan might be sorry he got himself into this...this...\u201d</p><p>\u201cRomance,\u201d she finally supplied. \u201cReally, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re having such a hard time with this. I\u2019m seeing someone, Walt, just like you are. It\u2019s not as if he\u2019s married or a priest or anything.\u201d She lifted one eyebrow at him. \u201cEveryone in this family has someone, even eighteen-year-old Tom. You\u2019d better get used to the idea I\u2019m no different than anyone else.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a little different,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cBetter, probably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhooey. I just want to be normal. Are you going to behave yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you getting at?\u201d</p><p>She crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cYou know exactly what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to be sure you\u2019re all right,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re a grown woman. If you\u2019ve made up your mind, I\u2019ll just hope all this works out for the best.\u201d He leaned down and kissed her forehead. \u201cAre you going to be home tonight?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI sincerely hope not,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know.\u201d</p> <p>Luke was up on the ladder, scraping old chipped paint off the eaves of number three when the general\u2019s Tahoe pulled up to his house. He had been expecting this, but he wasn\u2019t sure how it would happen, or when. Luke climbed slowly down the ladder. He tucked in his shirt and mopped his face with a rag.</p><p>\u201cLuke,\u201d the general said. He did not extend his usual hand.</p><p>\u201cSir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy niece hasn\u2019t been home until morning the last few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t armed, are you, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew where she was, of course. She was considerate enough to tell the family so we wouldn\u2019t worry. But I thought you and I should have a little talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead, sir,\u201d Luke said. He hoped it didn\u2019t show that his stomach was twisting. Not because he was afraid of the general\u2014he knew Walt wouldn\u2019t really shoot him\u2014but because he was afraid of the general somehow convincing Shelby she was making a big mistake. He\u2019d barely gotten into this with her; he was a long way from being ready to give her up.</p><p>Walt\u2019s cheeks darkened with a ruddy stain as he said, \u201cShe\u2019s been with you every night and she hasn\u2019t been riding. I don\u2019t know what to think\u2014that she\u2019s not sitting a horse.\u201d</p> <p>Luke looked down and found his own cheeks warming. \u201cSir, I can honestly say, I haven\u2019t ever been this uncomfortable in my life...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe says her back\u2019s bothering her...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen maybe her back\u2019s bothering her...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want something understood. Shelby might seem shy and sometimes not real sure of herself, but she\u2019s very stubborn. She does as she pleases. She always has. She might go at it quietly, but once she\u2019s decided, that\u2019s it. I tried like hell to talk her out of putting her life on hold to care for her mother. Midge could have gone into a nursing home, at least at the end. But I didn\u2019t make any headway because Shelby\u2019s mind was made up.\u201d He took a breath and shook his head. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure getting involved with you was the best idea, even though I don\u2019t dislike you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want her involved with me either, sir. But as you say, she\u2019s stubborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that gets us straight to the point\u2014I can\u2019t accuse you of coercing my niece or taking advantage of her. I was more than a little aware that she had you in her crosshairs, and I could see she was hell-bent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems you\u2019re right, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt appears the die is cast. She\u2019s made herself clear\u2014she plans to spend a good deal of time under your roof. When she\u2019s here, Riordan, you\u2019d better be a gentleman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely, General.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be curious to know what kind of plans you have where my niece is concerned,\u201d Walt said.</p><p>\u201cDue respect, sir, it would be wrong for me to discuss any plans with you before talking to Shelby. And at the risk of being indelicate, Shelby and I have barely\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll do,\u201d he said, holding up a hand. \u201cI know how that sentence was going to end. Leave it at that.\u201d</p><p>Luke took a breath. \u201cWhat I meant to say is\u2014we\u2019re just getting to know each other.\u201d Luke stepped forward. \u201cSir, I\u2019ve probably been around more than a father or uncle would prefer, but I\u2019d like you to know that Shelby is treated with absolute respect when she\u2019s with me. I consider it my responsibility to see she\u2019s protected, that she\u2019s safe with me. I treat her with great care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou damn sure better. I love that girl. She\u2019s very special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. Very special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not an idiot about relationships, son. I have two kids who have been through a few\u2014my daughter has already buried a husband at her young age...\u201d</p><p>That grave, Luke thought. He would have to remember to ask Shelby about it. Luke had assumed Paul was Vanessa\u2019s first husband.</p><p>\u201cI understand things don\u2019t always go smoothly,\u201d Walt was saying. \u201cSometimes these things don\u2019t work out, I\u2019m not naive about that. This thing with you and my niece, it\u2019ll either be a lasting thing or not\u2014that\u2019s yet to be seen. But if you do anything terrible to her...\u201d He sucked in his breath. \u201cYou know what I\u2019m talking about?\u201d</p><p>Luke frowned. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I do...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou abuse her, hit her, cheat on her and give her something, treat her with cruelty, or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake!\u201d Luke said, cutting him off and stiffening indignantly. \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about? What kind of man do you think I am?\u201d</p><p>Walt shrugged and said, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t have any reason to suspect you of foul behavior, yet, but after all, I\u2019ve seen a lot. I\u2019ve had a lot of different kind of men in my command. I thought we should understand each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe understand each other! I wouldn\u2019t do things like that to any woman! Jesus!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, then. Because I\u2019d have to kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d have to let you!\u201d Luke said passionately. He took a breath. \u201cDue respect, I\u2019ve known a real horseshit general or two. Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI felt the need to clear the air on a couple of issues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsider it cleared!\u201d He rubbed a hand along the back of his neck.</p><p>\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t come here to try to talk you out of seeing my niece. Given the situation with her mother passing not too long ago, I feel a little more protective than Shelby is comfortable with. I didn\u2019t think it would hurt for you to know\u2014I have limits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I,\u201d Luke said calmly but vehemently.</p><p>\u201cThen I guess we\u2019re clear.\u201d He turned as though he would go.</p><p>Luke watched his departing back and in a split second thought about how he\u2019d feel if he had to turn Shelby over to some guy.</p><p>\u201cSir,\u201d Luke called. When the general turned back, Luke said, \u201cNow that we\u2019ve faced off on this and both hold Shelby\u2019s well-being as the most important thing, I\u2019d like you to know some things. Shelby could do a lot better than me, we both know that. I didn\u2019t mislead her, I avoided her and discouraged her. I\u2019ve been completely honest with her; I\u2019m not a good catch and I\u2019m not looking for a permanent relationship. I\u2019m sure Shelby had no trouble believing that. But it\u2019s not my intention to treat her badly. Jesus, she\u2019ll get the best I have. If it\u2019s any comfort, my mother would kill me if I ever abused a woman. If she failed to kill me, my brothers would do the job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Walt said, a smile tugging at his mouth. \u201cI can appreciate a close family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might be a scoundrel, but I\u2019m a fairly civilized scoundrel.\u201d Luke stuck out his hand. \u201cI wish we could be friends. For Shelby, at least.\u201d</p><p>Walt hesitated, but he took Luke\u2019s hand. \u201cBehave decently,\u201d Walt said.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Luke said. \u201cYou, too.\u201d</p><p>After putting in a long day of work on the cabins, Luke went to his house as the sun was lowering in the sky. He laid a fresh fire in the hearth and took a shower. Just as he was getting out, he heard his front door open. Wrapping a towel around his waist, he left the bathroom in time to see Shelby coming in with a brown sack. \u201cWow,\u201d she said, looking at him. \u201cHow\u2019s that for timing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatcha got there?\u201d he asked, hands on his hips.</p><p>\u201cWhen I left the clinic, I stopped by the bar and got us some dinner so we could stay in tonight. I\u2019m tired. I brought some pie so Art can have dessert with us if he wants to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll want to. Art has never turned down a slice of pie.\u201d</p><p>She looked down his body and laughed. \u201cLuke,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cI don\u2019t even have my jacket off and you\u2019re popping out of your towel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell then, take your jacket off,\u201d he said. \u201cWill dinner keep for a little while?\u201d</p><p>She put the sack on the table, shrugged out of her jacket and walked into his arms. \u201cI put in a long day and the clinic was busy\u2014I\u2019ve been around babies and sick people. Can you give me some time to freshen up?\u201d</p><p>He gently touched her lips with his. \u201cSure. Help yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be too long,\u201d she said, slipping past him and into the bedroom to take off her boots and clothes.</p><p>Luke went into the kitchen and peered into the sack of take-out dinner. He pulled out the pie and put it in the fridge, then sniffed the remaining contents. It smelled delicious, but Preacher never put together a mediocre meal. He got down a couple of plates, pulled some flatware out of the drawer and opened two beers. Then he heard water running in the tub and headed toward the bathroom. He caught the scent of something feminine. Shelby had brought a couple of her things with her a few nights before\u2014shampoo and lotion and such. He told her to leave it\u2014something he\u2019d never invited a woman to do before. Things like that always made him claustrophobic, but this time it made him feel extremely good, as though he wouldn\u2019t have to release her too soon. As if holding her shampoo and lotion hostage meant she would stay with him for a while.</p><p>He entered the bathroom just in time to see her lowering herself into the tub. Her long hair was pinned up on her head and there were bubbles. It was in his mind to pass her a beer and sit on the closed toilet lid to talk with her while she was in the bath, but then another thought was inspired. Luke had never in his life even contemplated a bubble bath. He put the beer on the sink, dropped his towel and got in.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to make a flood!\u201d she said with a laugh. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis tub isn\u2019t quite big enough,\u201d he complained, sitting to face her, the faucet jabbing him in the back. He pushed his long legs past her hips, lifted her legs to drape them over his thighs and pulled her toward him, into his arms.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re acting crazy,\u201d she said, laughing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m impatient,\u201d he said, his lips on her neck. \u201cI can hardly get through the day, waiting for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not quite freshened up yet,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help with that,\u201d he said, picking up the soap. He ran the soap smoothly over her shoulders, down her back, over her breasts, under her arms, bringing low, delighted hums from her when he lathered her up. Then he took the face cloth and gently rinsed her. \u201cI want to tell you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother one of those talks? More conditions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I visited a clinic in Eureka. Right after our first night together. I had a screening for STDs. To be sure, though I was already pretty sure. I wanted you to know that despite my shady past, I\u2019m okay. You\u2019re not in any danger that I\u2019ll pass anything to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw,\u201d she said, pulling him closer, chest to chest. \u201cThat was thoughtful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo one\u2019s ever been inside you before me,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to keep you completely safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got the results just in time. I don\u2019t have a condom in this tub,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there\u2019s that other matter...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on the pill. I took care of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t think about your concerns\u2014I was handling mine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood news to me,\u201d he said. Then, after leaning in for a deep kiss, he said, \u201cI meant to tell you another thing\u2014your uncle visited me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did? He shouldn\u2019t have done that. What did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat he knew where you\u2019ve been every night. And that he didn\u2019t much like the fact that you weren\u2019t able to ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d she moaned.</p><p>\u201cIt was by far one of the worst moments of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Luke. I\u2019ll talk to him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t. We worked it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said, pulling her close him and gently rocking her against him. \u201cI refused to explain, he threatened me with dire consequences if I abused you or treated you cruelly, I tried to reassure him that I can be civilized if I concentrate, and in the end, we actually shook hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d she said. \u201cLuke, Uncle Walt and I already had our standoff about this. He told me to be careful of you and I told him he wasn\u2019t going to bully me out of whatever relationship I chose. He promised to behave himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou stood up to him?\u201d Luke asked, smiling. \u201cYou defended me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that surprise you? That I can stand up for myself? Really, does everyone think I\u2019m a spineless little twit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, you\u2019re just too sweet. And Walt wanted to be sure you\u2019re safe with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell him the truth? That I\u2019m not? That you\u2019re dangerous and wicked and a real shark with women?\u201d she asked playfully, tugging at his lower lip with her teeth.</p><p>\u201cNo one has to know, do they?\u201d he asked her. \u201cThat I was the first one to\u2014\u201d</p><p>She leaned back, looking at him. \u201cWhy? Do you want it to be a secret?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like it if that belonged to us. You and me. Private. Personal. It\u2019s so damn special.\u201d He grinned. \u201cI\u2019ve never had an experience like this in my life,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve had a ton of experience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ve never had any,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ve never been with anyone like you,\u201d he told her. \u201cYou\u2019re amazing. You drive me crazy. You\u2019ve got me playing house, for Christ\u2019s sake. I don\u2019t do things like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee? I tried to warn you. Maybe I should have given you the talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I never saw that coming,\u201d he said. \u201cYour uncle also wanted to know what plans I had with you. I told him that was for me to talk with you about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke, you shouldn\u2019t lie...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t. Right now I plan to make love to you till you beg me to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw. Well, that\u2019s today. You\u2019ll probably be tired of me in two weeks. Remember, you don\u2019t stay involved for long.\u201d</p><p>He ran a hand down her chest, over a breast, down to place a palm over her soft mound. \u201cHow are you down here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot sore? We getting you healed up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been very considerate. I didn\u2019t know I could function on so little sleep, but I happen to like it.\u201d She laughed. \u201cMore than I thought I would. I never thought I\u2019d be back every day. I guess I\u2019m being a real pig about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead. Be a pig about it. I can take it.\u201d He rubbed her gently. \u201cYou\u2019re opening up. Blossoming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p><p>He lifted her and brought her neatly onto his lap, slipping inside without difficulty. \u201cGod,\u201d he whispered. \u201cSweet heaven.\u201d Then with his mouth drawing on her nipple, his finger massaging her and his hips gently pumping, he loved her deeply and smoothly. She held his head against her breast and rocked with him, making all the wonderful little noises he\u2019d grown to love. In a few short and breathless minutes, she had risen to that pinnacle of pleasure that caused her insides to tighten and pulse. She pulled his head harder against her and he pushed more deeply inside, letting himself go in a blast of heat that blinded him for a moment. He clung to her, panting. Recovering. Wanting the moment never to end.</p><p>And then he heard her giggle. \u201cSomeone\u2019s going to have to wipe up the floor...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke Riordan, you\u2019re in a bubble bath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, breathless.</p><p>\u201cWhat would people think? Big, tough, womanizing Black Hawk pilot, in a bubble bath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better not tell or you\u2019ll be punished,\u201d he said, still catching his breath.</p><p>She giggled again. \u201cThat might be interesting. I never know what you\u2019ll come up with next.\u201d</p><p>Late in the night, long after dinner and some time in front of the fire, Luke was lying in bed, his head propped on a hand, staring down at the sleeping form of Shelby. She was curled on her side, her beautiful, smooth back and perfect bottom against him, and he could see her profile. She slept like a baby, content, peaceful and drunk on sex.</p><p>He had known from the moment he saw her that she was dangerous, but he\u2019d had no idea how lethal. She had pulled feelings to the surface that he thought he\u2019d been in control of and now it was here\u2014he felt it all and he was completely lost. Terrified. He adored her. He couldn\u2019t stand the thought of this ending.</p><p>He had felt something almost this deep and powerful once before, when he was much younger. He had been twenty-four when he found the beautiful, raven-haired Felicia. In her arms, in her body, he had come to life. He\u2019d never fallen so hard before, and certainly not since. He had been surprised by the passion and commitment he felt, but he let it sweep him away. He loved her hard for a year, and then he had to leave on a mission. He went to Somalia. When the conflict was at its worst, it was her face in his mind that helped him get through, gave him purpose, something strong and powerful to fight for. He had pledged his life to her; he was going to love her till the day he died.</p><p>When he got home he found out it had all been a lie; she had never been his. She\u2019d been unfaithful since before he left; she cut him loose the first day he was back. It had been an ugly, bitter parting that left everyone scarred\u2014mostly him.</p><p>To say his heart was ripped apart didn\u2019t touch it. For a couple of years at least the pain was so bad he thought it might kill him. When the pain stopped, he was empty inside. He made a firm resolution: that would never happen to him again. His involvement with women was purely recreational from that point on. He wasn\u2019t about to be vulnerable to a woman, open himself to that kind of pain.</p><p>Yet beside him, all gentle and sweet, was an incredible woman. He wanted to pull her into his arms, tell her how much he loved her, how far he\u2019d go to make her happy, beg her to either change her plans or include him.</p><p>But he wouldn\u2019t. It was too risky. Another deal like the last one would kill him. He wouldn\u2019t give his heart.</p><p>The problem was, without meaning to, without wanting to, he had.</p><p>Walt Booth had watched the evolution of Muriel\u2019s renovation for almost six months; he\u2019d helped with some of it, but she was extremely protective of her work and wanted to be able to take credit for doing it herself. As he witnessed, he learned a few things. One\u2014gutting and remodeling, upgrading, modernizing, might be expensive, but it was easy. And such houses, like his, were a dime a dozen. All you needed was money and a builder. What Muriel was doing\u2014restoring it to its former pristine beauty\u2014was an art. Well\u2014it was largely restored. She had new appliances and wasn\u2019t about to be sitting on spindly settees or sleeping on a hundred-year-old mattress. She couldn\u2019t wait to get her flat-screen TV, stereo and DVD equipment, all of which would be kept in antique wardrobes.</p><p>It was mid-November when she called him and said, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m babysitting while Vanni runs into town. She\u2019ll be back soon. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to come over,\u201d Muriel said. \u201cAs soon as you can.\u201d</p><p>She never had to ask him twice. When he pulled up, she was all bundled up and standing on the porch of the big house, waiting. Her hands were plunged into her pockets, she was stamping her booted feet and her breath was swirling in steam around her.</p><p>He got out of the Tahoe. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d he asked, walking toward her.</p><p>Her face lit up in that brilliant smile of hers. \u201cMatter? God, nothing! Walt\u2014it\u2019s done. Done.\u201d</p><p>Muriel had the upstairs finished to her satisfaction at least a couple of months ago, but she\u2019d never moved out of the refurbished bunkhouse; she hadn\u2019t wanted to move that furniture out and live in a mostly empty house when she was perfectly comfortable where she was. She just kept working away.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReady,\u201d he said.</p><p>She swung open the front door and he was standing right in a living room\u2014no fancy foyers in old farmhouses. The dark wood floor gleamed; the baseboards and crown molding were the same dark, varnished color. She\u2019d needed his help to lift the heavy sections of crown molding, but she\u2019d fit it herself, using her very own circular saw. The walls, textured by her own hand, were painted green. The banister had been stained and varnished to match the walnut trim and molding, and the wall of the open staircase was a dark beige, the ceilings a lighter beige. Straight ahead, the same color scheme as the living room, the dining room was framed by a walnut arch. She must have recently installed the sheer, lacy curtains that were pulled back from the windows. The hearth was framed in the original, thick dark wood mantel.</p><p>The kitchen was bright yellow, some of it papered in a design of old-fashioned yellow roses. The cupboards and counters were the originals, sanded and stained, but she\u2019d pulled the cupboard doors apart and installed dark glass panels to replace the old, buckling wood. The sink and appliances were new white, but she kept the sink pump handle right where it was. She\u2019d even sanded and stained the windowsills and frames. And the light fixtures that hung over the kitchen, dining room and breakfast nook were rewired antiques. There was a door to a pantry and a door to the cellar.</p><p>\u201cYou are amazing,\u201d he said.</p><p>The upstairs was equally impressive\u2014the shining hallway floors, three bedrooms all painted different colors, a bath much too small and compact for a movie star down the hall from the largest bedroom. No master baths or walk-in closets here. But every detail of the original house was polished, varnished, painted, papered. It was beautiful. It looked like a museum piece. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis will be my room, at the top of the stairs,\u201d she said. \u201cI bought a bunch of quilts, but I bought them from a real quilter, so I\u2019m only cheating a little bit. And throw pillows in petit point\u2014actual antiques. I\u2019ve been collecting them for years. I have a new floral-print duvet and matching sheets\u2014I bought ten extra top sheets. Instead of wallpaper in here, I\u2019m gluing sheets to a couple of walls. And I have old pictures of my parents and grandparents and great-grandparents to hang on the staircase wall. We have some Native Americans way back in the family tree and, remarkably, have some pictures of them. I also have a couple of old country watercolors I picked up years ago and took special care to preserve for this moment.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and chuckled. \u201cThis is not how a woman nominated for Oscars is supposed to want to live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhooey. There\u2019s a lot more to me than Oscars. Though I have to admit, it really pisses me off that I never got one.\u201d She smiled up at him and put her arms around his waist. \u201cI\u2019ve had some special pieces of furniture in storage. The movers are coming tomorrow. Will you stay with me when the bed\u2019s made up?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI will gladly stay with you in your flowery bedroom. And if I ever get rid of my houseful of offspring, you will stay with me in my bold and manly master bedroom with convenient master bath and big doorless shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d She grinned.</p><p>\u201cMuriel, this house... It\u2019s beyond my wildest expectations. You\u2019re gifted. Your talent is unsurpassed. I just can\u2019t express how impressed I am. And proud. I\u2019m just so proud of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. I\u2019m proud of me, too. We should have a drink and cigar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never have thought to bring cigars,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cNot to worry. I bought us a bottle of Pinch and box of cigars. I\u2019ll leave all the lights on in the house. We\u2019ll sit on the bunkhouse porch, freeze to death, have a scotch and a Cuban and stare at the house. Is that brownish-lavender porch the best?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCubans? You have Cubans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. You don\u2019t think Mike V. will arrest me, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he finds out, it\u2019ll be tough to keep the local marines off your porch.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled. \u201cI want to have a housewarming after the furniture is in and pictures hung. Do you think anyone would come?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re Muriel St. Claire. I think the whole town will come.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d she asked, surprised. \u201cThat would be so wonderful.\u201d Then her brow wrinkled as she thought it over. \u201cWhat will I do for food?\u201d</p><p>Luke and Shelby fell into the nice little pattern of new lovers, with Shelby sleeping over almost every night. Then she would start her day real early, going first to Walt\u2019s stable to help with the horses, maybe have a ride and breakfast with him, shower and grab a change of clothes. Next she\u2019d go to town where her main industry was keeping Mel\u2019s professional life manageable. She helped in the clinic, sorted and filed, watched the kids. Luke marveled at her energy, her industry.</p><p>Luke and Art worked together on the cabins every day and Luke took great pride in the fact that Art was quite functional. He wasn\u2019t a gourmet cook, but he could warm a nourishing dinner in the microwave a few nights a week, eating with Luke and Shelby the other nights. He showered and shaved daily, took good care of his teeth, laundered his clothes, fixed his bed every morning. Luke had stocked his cupboards with decent food and nontoxic cleaning supplies. Art had fruit to add to his breakfast and lunch. He kept his bathroom and little kitchen spotless with spray cleaner.</p><p>Art was absolutely competent to live on his own, as long as he had someone trustworthy nearby in case he needed advice or ran into a problem, or maybe to remind him of things like, \u201cTime to wash the sheets and towels, Art.\u201d Luke told him that when the cabins were finished, Art could be the custodian. He\u2019d make sure the trash was handled, that things were tidy, and they\u2019d work together on upkeep, cleaning, yard maintenance, whatever needed fixing or painting.</p><p>\u201cDo you miss your old friends at the group home?\u201d Luke asked him.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI miss Netta and Payne,\u201d he said. \u201cI miss my mom.\u201d Then he smiled. \u201cBut I like it here by the river. I like my own house where I don\u2019t have to sign up to use the washer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing a great job for me, Art. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Luke,\u201d he said, beaming proudly.</p> <p>At the end of her day, Shelby would either meet Luke at Jack\u2019s or pick up dinner and go straight to his house. They were together every day. They were outed. They were a couple and everyone in town knew it.</p><p>This was something Luke hadn\u2019t thought about, this couple status. But the price of holding her through the night was this public recognition. People were nice enough not to make too many invasive comments, though there were lots of jokes about the water in Virgin River. It seemed plenty of men had made their way to the little town looking for peace and quiet, maybe some hunting and fishing, and found themselves tethered to a woman. Luke was able to chuckle and ignore them because it gave him strange satisfaction to be connected to her in this way; he was oddly content to be able to put his arm around her in public, to not worry about being caught kissing on the porch. Shelby had him so loose and relaxed, he wasn\u2019t likely to complain.</p><p>When it was obvious to the whole town that Luke and Shelby were together, it was time to bring Art out of the closet, introduce him around, give him a chance to make friends, even if they were only casual friends. Art had been out at the cabins less than two months and of all the residents of Virgin River, only Shelby and Paul had seen him, knew about him. They\u2019d been cooperative about staying quiet while Luke had been paying attention to newspapers, radio and TV to see if Art was being looked for. There didn\u2019t seem to be any missing persons bulletins.</p><p>Art already loved Shelby. If she had a short day at the clinic and the weather was nice, she would ride over to the cabins with Plenty in tow and put Art on the horse. He was like a one-hundred-and-ninety-pound ten-year-old and the guy\u2019s sheer thrill with it made Luke laugh until he had to turn away to not offend. Luke started to take Art to the bar once in a while to buy him a cold drink, maybe dinner with Shelby. It held positively no surprise that he was accepted very kindly.</p><p>It was seeing Art on that horse that prompted Luke to buy some fishing gear for the man, an inexpensive rod and reel he could keep in his cabin. He taught Art to drop a line first. Casting was more of a challenge, but Art loved learning new things. The river was close enough for Art to get in a little fishing when he wasn\u2019t working. He took to it right away. It made Luke happy to see the big guy wander down to the river on his own, independent and content.</p><p>There was a small town party out at Muriel St. Claire\u2019s house that Luke, Shelby and Art attended together. It was newly remodeled, or as the general insisted on pointing out, restored. Indeed, it looked like a brand-new hundred-year-old house. Even the pictures, which she insisted were of family members, were antique. The oldest were tintypes. Besides a modern sectional and chair, everything was vintage, even the huge, antique wardrobe that concealed her TV and stereo equipment.</p><p>Luke was astonished by the work she\u2019d done, impressed, but some of the townfolk, especially the women, were looking for something a lot more Hollywood. Most of them already had all that old stuff\u2014it had been passed down from generation to generation and they took it for granted. Of course, their old stuff hadn\u2019t been pampered and restored like Muriel\u2019s, but they were small-town folk and lusted after more modern furnishings. What they wanted to know was, had she dated Clint Eastwood or Jack Nicholson? When she replied she hardly knew them, though she\u2019d been in films with them, they seemed disappointed in her. For a movie star, she wasn\u2019t all that provocative.</p><p>At least a hundred people wandered through her open house and she beamed every time surprise was expressed that she would prefer this old farmhouse to a big marble palace in Hollywood.</p><p>Life was exactly as he liked it. Being a man, he wasted no time thinking deeply about it; feelings weren\u2019t exactly something men spent a lot of time pondering. All he wanted was for nothing to change.</p><p>To that end, he called his mother and explained that he wouldn\u2019t be able to come to Phoenix for Thanksgiving. It turned out it would only be Sean this year anyway; Colin was in Iraq, Paddy out to sea and Aiden was pulling call at the hospital over Thanksgiving to get Christmas off. His mother was disappointed; she hadn\u2019t seen him since August. So he told her about Art. Of course, Maureen Riordan told Luke to bring Art with him. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can do that, Mother,\u201d Luke said. \u201cHe\u2019s on the run from a group home because someone abused him. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m not breaking the law by giving him shelter, but I don\u2019t think it would be a good idea to take him out of state. At least not until I\u2019ve had a chance to get his situation sorted out a little, which is going to take some investigating and probably legal help. It\u2019s just one Thanksgiving. I\u2019ll probably see you at Christmas. Be a big girl. Don\u2019t nag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t nag,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOh, you nag.\u201d He laughed. \u201cThere\u2019s no mercy in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to be alone on Thanksgiving,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine, Mother. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>But Luke wasn\u2019t going to be alone. He was going to the general\u2019s house, and he was bringing Art. The invitation had come through Shelby and he recognized right away that it was mandatory. He\u2019d rather not get any more enmeshed with the family, but it was impossible to avoid. When it came to living in a place like Virgin River, you were enmeshed the day you hit town. It was all right\u2014a holiday dinner wasn\u2019t too much to ask. Art was welcome and Luke happened to like the general and the Haggertys. He couldn\u2019t deny that if Shelby had been his young cousin or niece, he might feel just as protective as they did, yet they\u2019d managed to act as though they respected her choice and treated him fine.</p><p>Just as he was coming to accept it all, Luke\u2019s well-organized life was derailed by a phone call from his brother Sean.</p><p>\u201cSo, you put in a no-show for the turkey,\u201d Sean said. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with that? You\u2019re stateside, you\u2019re not that far away....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have things to do here, Sean,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I explained to Mother\u2014I can\u2019t leave Art and I can\u2019t take him on a trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I heard. And that\u2019s your only reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, as if he did know what else. \u201cWell then, you\u2019ll be real happy to hear this\u2014I\u2019m bringing Mother to Virgin River for Thanksgiving.\u201d</p><p>Luke was dead silent for a moment. \u201cWhat!\u201d Luke nearly shouted into the phone. \u201cWhy the hell would you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you won\u2019t come to Phoenix. And she\u2019d like to see this property you\u2019re working on. And the helper. And the girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t doing this to me,\u201d Luke said in a threatening tone. \u201cTell me you aren\u2019t doing this to me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, since you can\u2019t make it to Mom\u2019s, we\u2019re coming to you. I thought that would make you sooo happy,\u201d he added with a chuckle in his voice.</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have room for you. There\u2019s not a hotel in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lying sack of shit. You have room. You have two extra bedrooms and six cabins you\u2019ve been working on for three months. But if it turns out you\u2019re telling the truth, there\u2019s a motel in Fortuna that has some room. As long as Mom has the good bed in the house, clean sheets and no rats, everything will be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. You come,\u201d Luke said. \u201cAnd then I\u2019m going to kill you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?

Buy a big turkey, huh?\u201d</p> <p>Luke was paralyzed for a moment. Silent and brooding.</p><p>He had lived a pretty wild life, excepting that couple of years with Felicia, when he\u2019d been temporarily domesticated. He\u2019d flown helicopters in combat and played it loose with the ladies, taking whatever was consensually offered. His bachelorhood was on the adventurous side. His brothers were exactly like him; maybe like their father before them, who hadn\u2019t married until the age of thirty-two. Not exactly ancient, but for the generation before theirs, a little mature to begin a family of five sons. They were frisky Irish males. They all had taken on a lot: dared much, had no regrets, moved fast.</p><p>But one thing none of them had ever done was have a woman who was not a wife in bed with them under the same roof with their mother.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thirty-eight years old and I\u2019ve been to war four times,\u201d he said to himself, pacing in his small living room, rubbing a hand across the back of his neck. \u201cThis is my house and she is a guest. She can disapprove all she wants, work her rosary until she has blisters on her hands, but this is not up to her.\u201d</p><p>Okay, then she\u2019ll tell everything, was his next thought. Every little thing about me from the time I was five, every young lady she\u2019d had high hopes for, every indiscretion, my night in jail, my very naked fling with the high-school vice-principal\u2019s daughter.... Everything from speeding tickets to romances. Because that\u2019s the way the typical dysfunctional Irish family worked\u2014they bartered in secrets. He could either behave the way his mother expected, which she considered proper and gentlemanly and he considered tight-assed and useless, or he could throw caution to the wind, do things his way, and explain all his mother\u2019s stories to Shelby later. Including the story about Felicia.</p> <p>It really didn\u2019t make sense for Luke to expect his mother to be a prude. She was obviously much too with it for that. She was a beautiful, statuesque sixty-one-year-old woman who\u2019d been widowed at fifty-three when Luke was only thirty, and remained single and devoted to her military sons. She still had her hair dyed the flaming red of her youth. With some ambivalence, he sometimes wished his mother would find a romantic interest that would take her mind off her boys and their personal lives.</p><p>Maureen Riordan was smart, energetic and funny. She was fearless; despite her commitment to her Catholic faith, she had some rebellious ideas. After five sons in ten years, the priest had told her to keep the faith and reject birth control, and she had told him to do something to himself that was never again repeated. But there hadn\u2019t been a sixth child. Getting down to it, she didn\u2019t have that many flaws\u2014just this rigid set of principles she could be coerced into being quiet about if her demands were met. And there was her relentless dissatisfaction with her sons\u2019 inability to marry successfully and bring her grandchildren. That was getting real old.</p><p>The boys ranked thusly: Luke, Colin, Aiden, Sean, Patrick. Ages thirty-eight to thirty, down the line. All bachelors. Maureen might be getting a little bewildered and desperate.</p><p>As it stood, they had a firm family law that had evolved through bitter fights\u2014no one told embarrassing or family secrets to newcomers without paying, and paying dearly. Frankly, Luke thought the story about his mother standing up to the priest about birth control was hilarious\u2014but she didn\u2019t find it funny. And a trade was a trade. He could keep her quiet by respecting her principles and not telling stories on her. He could keep his mother\u2019s mouth shut by not sleeping with Shelby while she was in town. For five nights.</p><p>He was going to have to kill Sean.</p><p>\u201cShelby?\u201d Luke began while she relaxed in his arms in the aftermath of yet another amazing sexual experience. \u201cThere\u2019s a complication with Thanksgiving.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHmm?\u201d she asked sleepily.</p><p>He took a breath. \u201cMy brother Sean is coming. And bringing my mother.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head. \u201cWonderful,\u201d she said, smiling, lying back down.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not wonderful,\u201d he said miserably.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Luke? That\u2019s not bad news. I\u2019d be so happy to meet your mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but... See, she\u2019s a little on the rigid side...\u201d</p><p>Shelby laughed again. \u201cOkay. Like Uncle Walt doesn\u2019t get a little stiff? We\u2019ll just set two more places. It could be fun. Stiff Uncle Walt and rigid... What\u2019s your mom\u2019s name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Maureen, but we\u2019re not going to do that. We\u2019re not getting them all together, like one big happy family. You know how I feel about stuff like that. I don\u2019t like setting up those kind of expectations.... This isn\u2019t... This can\u2019t be...\u201d</p> <p>She laughed some more. \u201cWill you please stop being so paranoid? It\u2019s not an engagement party, it\u2019s Thanksgiving. We bring together people who are important to us. You\u2019re also bringing Art\u2014and he certainly doesn\u2019t complicate the whole family thing. My God, Luke. Lighten up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt screws up my head, thinking about getting our families together. Maybe you\u2019ve accepted me the way I am, but I\u2019m not convinced your uncle has. And I know my mother hasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s not an issue. That would be their problem. We\u2019ve been over this\u2014I know you pretty well, despite your efforts to be my greatest mystery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do, huh? Still, this whole family thing... It\u2019s not what I had in mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat you had in mind was picking up a girl from out of town, having her in your bed at night and far away the rest of the time, with no connection to your day-to-day life. Unfortunately, we\u2019re from the same town right now. And we have all the same friends.\u201d</p><p>How did she know that? he wondered. He had never explained what he\u2019d originally hoped this would be.</p><p>\u201cBut if you\u2019ll just relax, everything will be fine,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re all good friends and neighbors. Let me ask you\u2014would your mother mind coming to our house as opposed to having a nice private turkey with you, your brother and Art?\u201d</p><p>He was quiet a moment and then said, in a pout, \u201cNo. She\u2019d love it.\u201d</p><p>She giggled. \u201cOh, I see. You\u2019re afraid she\u2019s going to like me....\u201d</p><p>\u201cShelby, stop it. You know what my problem is with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess your problem is with your mother, because I certainly haven\u2019t given you any trouble. You and I\u2014we knew what we were getting ourselves into. I have plans, you have plans, this is temporary. Isn\u2019t that what you said? Temporary. So. It\u2019s just a couple of families getting together for Thanksgiving.\u201d She grinned at him. \u201cI like Sean. He\u2019s cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s an ugly, stupid asshole.\u201d</p><p>Shelby laughed at him. \u201cThere is going to be one inconvenience,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYeah? What\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to be able to spend the night with you while your mother\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>He propped up on an elbow and looked at her. \u201cYou\u2019re not?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s a little old-fashioned, but that\u2019s a bit too much for me. She\u2019s your mother. I can\u2019t stay here any more than I can bring you to my house while my Uncle Walt is down the hall. I hope you understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Shelby, they know we\u2019re...what we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quite the same thing,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not doing it under the same roof with them. Maybe if we actually lived together, as in set up housekeeping, changed addresses, etcetera. But no\u2014we\u2019re a dating couple having sex. I\u2019m not doing that with your mother in the same house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you can\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. I can\u2019t. Out of respect. That\u2019s just it. I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s staying five nights,\u201d he said, running a hand along the hair that fell over her shoulder. \u201cFive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess you\u2019ll be some kind of maniac by the time she leaves. Maybe I can get Mel to prescribe something so you don\u2019t go out of your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you want?\u201d he asked. \u201cFor us to be apart for five nights?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to be, Luke. We all have our ground rules. Now I want you to relax. It\u2019s just dinner. It\u2019ll be fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said.</p><p>There were two reasons he hadn\u2019t been able to think of a way to explain why he couldn\u2019t cross that line with his mother, either. He was stunned that Shelby hadn\u2019t used the opportunity to pull him into a more serious relationship. And, he didn\u2019t want to sound like a wussy mama\u2019s boy.</p><p>But, he thought, it\u2019s not supposed to be like this. This isn\u2019t the way women acted. She was too cool. It was almost as though she wasn\u2019t madly in love with him. She was deliberately passing up an opportunity to trap him.</p><p>Muriel and Walt spent a whole day driving through the mountains, looking for garage sales and antique shops. He\u2019d never in his life done anything like this. Nor had he ever cooked for a woman or helped her restore a house.</p><p>She was folding and refolding a Garberville newspaper in her hands. \u201cOkay, there\u2019s a barn sale up the next road about a half mile....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can you possibly need from a barn sale?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I\u2019ve explained fifty times, you just never know. I once bought an incredible hundred-and-fifty-year-old pine dry sink from a barn sale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour house doesn\u2019t seem to need more furnishings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this is what I do! Like some women drink martinis, I shop for antiques and collectibles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou also drink martinis.\u201d</p><p>She grinned at him. \u201cI pride myself in being well rounded.\u201d</p><p>He pulled off to the side of the road. He turned and looked at her, resting the wrist of his left arm on the steering wheel. \u201cMuriel, have you had invitations for Thanksgiving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAre you going south for the holiday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t decided,\u201d she said. \u201cA few friends were very thoughtful to think of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMind if I ask? What friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one you know, Walt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust the same...\u201d</p><p>She took a breath. \u201cSusan Sarandon extended an invitation to join her family. Lovely family. Love those kids. My friend George has reservations at a nice restaurant for a few friends\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeorge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a boyfriend. Clooney, George Clooney. Very nice man. Very attached at the moment and a tad young for me. He\u2019s dating a woman in her thirties, I could be her mother. I actually met George many years ago through his aunt Rosemary. And there was a call from an old, old friend\u2014Ed Asner. He has a small family gathering at his house. And of course Mason would like me to join him and his fourth wife and her grown children and grandchildren.\u201d She chuckled. \u201cWe\u2019re so modern, aren\u2019t we? The ex-wife is invited to dinner all the time. Of course, twenty percent of me is very appealing to her, I\u2019m sure.\u201d When Walt looked perplexed, she laughed. \u201cHis commission, Walt. That\u2019s what he gets when I work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. So, where are you going?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. Why?\u201d</p><p>He was a bit uncomfortable. He looked away briefly. \u201cWe\u2019re hosting Luke Riordan and his family. If you\u2019d like to join us, that would be wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalt?\u201d</p><p>He turned back toward her, meeting her eyes, her smile. \u201cWhat?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you hoping I\u2019ll decline?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t even look me in the eye when you asked me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said. \u201cSorry. It\u2019s just that, I know you want to keep us...casual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did I say that?\u201d she asked with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cWhen you said you\u2019d been married five times and were done with that shit. I believe that\u2019s a direct quote.\u201d</p><p>That amused her. She reached over and put a hand on his thigh. \u201cWalt, it would take a lot to get me to ever consider marriage again. I\u2019ve been through the wringer on marriages. I say \u2018I do\u2019 and there\u2019s a cosmic explosion turning fabulous, sexy men into incorrigible animals or complete idiots. I\u2019m cursed\u2014I wouldn\u2019t do that to anyone. But I\u2019m not avoiding a good relationship. And this seems as though it\u2019s shaping up to be a very good relationship. I\u2019d love to join you for Thanksgiving dinner. But since we both know my limitations, I\u2019ll be in charge of cleanup.\u201d</p><p>His black brows lifted and he smiled. \u201cReally?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not Susan Sarandon or George Clooney for one thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr Ed Asner, who is very special to me. But you are Walt Booth, and you rank right up there. But be careful, Walt. People will think we\u2019re serious.\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her. \u201cAt the risk of scaring you to death, I\u2019m very serious about you, Muriel. And a good relationship is exactly what I\u2019m in the market for. That, and a decent dishwasher.\u201d</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>When Sean and Maureen arrived late Tuesday afternoon, Luke was ready for them. The house was cleaned from top to bottom and, though there was still a lot of renovation to complete, the walls were textured and painted, the floors sanded, stained and varnished and the kitchen rebuilt. His furniture was good stuff\u2014it made the place look better. He would put his mother in his room and his brother upstairs. Since there was no furniture in the second upstairs bedroom, he\u2019d take the couch. He had logs in the fireplace, wine chilling in the refrigerator, steaks to put on the small grill he\u2019d purchased...and he\u2019d told Shelby she would meet Maureen Wednesday night because he\u2019d want a little time to visit with his mother first. That wasn\u2019t the reason, of course. He could have asked Shelby to come over right after she finished in town on Tuesday, but that might look eager, and Maureen didn\u2019t need any encouragement.</p> <p>Much as he resented the intrusion, he was actually thrilled to see his mom. He figured in about two days he\u2019d be less thrilled, but when she stepped out of Sean\u2019s SUV, he beamed. Damn, she sure didn\u2019t look sixty-one and on both blood pressure and cholesterol medication. And you\u2019d never take her for a woman who\u2019d been a stay-at-home mom raising five very high-maintenance sons. She looked sophisticated even though she wore jeans, boots and a leather jacket. The thing that really melted him was his mother\u2019s smile, her eyes. Her smile was so stunning and bright; she had large, strong, white teeth. And Luke couldn\u2019t remember a time her green eyes hadn\u2019t sparkled; now they crinkled just a little bit in the corners when she grinned.</p><p>\u201cLuke! Honey!\u201d she called, running up onto the porch and embracing him.</p><p>He held her in his arms for a long minute. \u201cHow you doing, Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t get here fast enough, that\u2019s how.\u201d She held him away from her. \u201cYou look okay. I was afraid you\u2019d be thin and pale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, why would I be thin and pale?\u201d he asked. He glanced over her shoulder to see Sean struggling with multiple suitcases from the back of the SUV. \u201cJesus, how long are you staying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust until Sunday\u2014but it was hard to know what to bring for a place like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you just brought everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny,\u201d she said. \u201cSo where is Art? And Shelby?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShelby?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI heard all about her from Sean. Pretty little thing, the only niece of a general, young, great on a horse, crazy about you, etcetera...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, she\u2019s not here. She\u2019s at home. I asked her to come over tomorrow night to meet you and we\u2019ve been invited to her uncle\u2019s house for Thanksgiving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said, sounding disappointed. \u201cI was looking forward to cooking for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can do that,\u201d he said hopefully. \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019d understand\u2014we don\u2019t see each other that often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. I have plenty of time to cook and leave you leftovers. And what are we to bring to Shelby\u2019s family for the meal?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. It might not take two days for that excitement to wear off, after all. \u201cWine. I bought it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to take something else,\u201d she said. \u201cPies, beans, bread, something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me get the luggage, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. And then show me this wonderful place.\u201d</p><p>Luke went down the steps while his mother went directly into the house to look around. There\u2019s one thing about having five boys with a strict father\u2014Maureen was not to insult them by lifting a finger while they were around, except in domestic ways. They wouldn\u2019t let her haul groceries or luggage while any of them were present. So Luke went to the back of the SUV where Sean was unloading way too many suitcases for five nights. \u201cYou\u2019d think she was taking a fricking cruise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour death is going to be slow and painful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, come on! What\u2019s up your butt now? You had plenty of time to get used to the idea. And she\u2019s thrilled to be here, you can see that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told her all about Shelby? I didn\u2019t even tell you what was going on with Shelby! Can\u2019t you ever keep your mouth shut about anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon\u2014I fly a spy plane. I have a very large security clearance. I told her about Shelby to piss you off.\u201d He grinned. \u201cDid I hear right? We\u2019re going to the general\u2019s for dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to me carefully, because if you screw this up I really will kill you. She\u2019s young and inexperienced, not my type, I\u2019m too old for her and it\u2019s not serious. Her uncle is trained in hand-to-hand combat and he doesn\u2019t like that she likes me. It\u2019s not the usual thing, so just keep your big mouth shut. You hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhew, this is making you testy,\u201d Sean said with a smirk. \u201cThat means it\u2019s heating up. Where\u2019s Art?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn his cabin. I\u2019ll go get him as soon as we get these bags in the house.\u201d Luke hefted two. \u201cJesus, where did she think she was going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe plans to be at her best for your new friends. You know, you could have avoided all this by just going to Phoenix for two days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to avoid you for years, but you just won\u2019t go away,\u201d Luke grumbled. \u201cThis was your idea and you know it. Don\u2019t screw with me.\u201d</p><p>Sean stiffened. \u201cIn three seconds we\u2019ll be back twenty years, rolling in the dirt. Let\u2019s not do this to her, huh? She really gives a shit what\u2019s happening with you. I don\u2019t, but she does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAch,\u201d Luke said, hefting a couple more bags. He took them up on the porch and said, \u201cPut her stuff in my room. You\u2019re upstairs. I\u2019m going for Art.\u201d He went down the steps to the cabin next door.</p><p>Luke gave two taps and opened the door. Art was sitting on the edge of his bed, made up tidily every morning, just waiting. He was all cleaned up, his sparse hair slicked back and wearing the new pants that Luke had purchased for him. His hands were clasped in front of him and he seemed to be terrified. \u201cArt?\u201d Luke asked.</p><p>\u201cAre they here now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re here. You ready to come say hello?\u201d</p><p>He stood up nervously and rubbed his palms down his trousers. He nodded too vigorously.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? It\u2019s just Sean and my mother. You know Sean. You got along fine. You worried about something?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head forcefully. Luke stepped toward him. \u201cLook, you\u2019re shook up about something. What\u2019s got you so upset?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. I had a shower. I didn\u2019t eat sandwiches, like you said.\u201d</p><p>Luke smiled. Art loved his bologna sandwiches. \u201cYou look great. I just wanted you to be hungry for dinner and you wouldn\u2019t be if you filled up on sandwiches. You\u2019ll have some steak with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteak is hard. I had it. I don\u2019t work the knife that good because I didn\u2019t use it that much, and steak gets too big for my mouth. My head\u2019s big but my mouth is small, that\u2019s what Stan said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou worried about that?\u201d Luke asked, smiling. \u201cI\u2019ll help with that. You\u2019ll work the knife fine\u2014you do everything else with tools just fine. We\u2019ll get the steak small enough for your mouth. By the way, I don\u2019t buy that, that your mouth is small. I listen to you all day long, and I wouldn\u2019t call it a small mouth. Come on, you\u2019re the first person my mother asked about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother\u2019s gone now,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI know, Art. You\u2019ll like my mother. She\u2019ll like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not like everyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told her you had Down syndrome, Art. She knows all about that. We had a good friend with Down\u2019s growing up\u2014you\u2019re not going to disappoint anyone. You\u2019re perfect. She\u2019ll like you very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIs that what you\u2019re worried about? Aw, it\u2019s going to be fine\u2014my mother is a very nice person. To people other than her sons, anyway. Come on, let\u2019s get on with this so you can settle down. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen you nervous. You act like you\u2019re scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a shower,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd didn\u2019t eat the sandwiches. One, I had one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Luke laughed. \u201cWere you hungry? Because around here you eat when you\u2019re hungry. You don\u2019t get in trouble for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said. \u201cI know.\u201d And he twisted his hands.</p><p>\u201cJesus, we better get this over with,\u201d Luke said. \u201cShe\u2019s not the queen of England. Calm down.\u201d</p><p>Art moved slowly. As Luke walked to his house, he had to pause and wait for Art several times and it was not far. By the time he opened the door to his house, his mother and Sean were working their way into the wine.</p><p>\u201cWell, hello,\u201d Maureen said brightly. \u201cYou must be Art.\u201d</p><p>Art stood just inside the door, looked down at the floor and nodded.</p><p>\u201cThen come in. I\u2019m so happy to finally meet you. I hope you\u2019re hungry\u2014I think we\u2019re going to a place called Jack\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Luke shot a glance at Sean and scowled. This could really screw up his plan to have his relationship with Shelby appear casual. Sean shrugged and glanced away.</p><p>\u201cI like Jack,\u201d Art said tremulously.</p><p>\u201cI have steaks,\u201d Luke said. \u201cI thought we\u2019d stay in.\u201d</p><p>Maureen came out of the kitchen and went to Art. \u201cSteaks will keep\u2014we want to do the town. Are you a little shy, Art?\u201d she asked him softly.</p><p>He nodded, but not quite so ferociously.</p><p>\u201cWell, you don\u2019t have to be shy with me, because I\u2019ve been looking forward to meeting you. And I hear you\u2019ve been a big help to Luke.\u201d</p><p>Art lifted his eyes and said, \u201cYou\u2019re not the queen of England.\u201d</p><p>Maureen gave Luke a withering stare from narrowed eyes, something she had perfected by the time he was seven. It was that warning glance. The boys called it the \u201cdon\u2019t fuck with me\u201d look, but Maureen had never in her life uttered that word.</p><p>\u201cBut I almost am, Art, so I trust you to be very sweet and nice.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cOf course you will,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, do you have a handshake or hug for Luke\u2019s mother?\u201d</p><p>He just stood there, uncertain. Maureen wrapped her arms around him, pulled him close and rocked him. \u201cAh, yes. So wonderful of you to help Luke. So wonderful to meet you.\u201d</p> <p>When she released him, he said, \u201cMy mother\u2019s gone now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she dead, Art?\u201d Maureen asked gently. And he nodded. \u201cThen I\u2019m so sorry. And you must need a mother\u2019s hug even more.\u201d She grinned. \u201cLet\u2019s have another.\u201d And he freed up his arms to hug her back.</p><p>Luke found himself smiling in spite of the fact that he was trying to remain insulted by the whole invasion.</p><p>The one thing that would make any man\u2014at least a normal man\u2014happy, was tougher than a two-dollar steak for Luke to swallow. Maureen won them over. Not just Shelby, not just Shelby\u2019s family, the entire town. To be fair, Maureen hadn\u2019t met every resident of Virgin River, but she\u2019d met the crowd Luke considered to be his new friends. And she not only impressed them, she made Luke look good.</p><p>They started out with dinner at Jack\u2019s the first night she was in town and of course Shelby was there when they came in, so the introductions began early. Of course, why wouldn\u2019t Shelby be there? She had nothing better to do; she hadn\u2019t been invited to Luke\u2019s. Her face lit up in a way that made Luke feel guilty; Sean grabbed her and hugged her like they were old friends, then made the introductions himself because he was like that\u2014out in front, the gregarious one. The general wandered in with the famous Muriel and they all stayed for the usual gang dinner with Mel and Jack, Brie and Mike. Maureen couldn\u2019t be kept out of the kitchen, asking Preacher and Paige a lot of questions about the operation of the bar and while doing so, holding their new baby. Luke peeked into the kitchen to see what she was up to and got the hell out of there before she started harping on the fact that she had five healthy, handsome, successful sons and no grandchildren.</p> <p>Maureen had a gift for getting to know people, for putting them at ease and showing her finest qualities. For example, she kept Art near her and was often seen holding his hand, something that showed her kindness, her tenderness. She made the general laugh, endeared herself to Mel and Brie, nurtured and courted Shelby, and she was best friends with Muriel in minutes. A covert glance at the general told Luke he was close to thrilled with Luke\u2019s gene pool.</p><p>Dinner the next night was an intimate family meal with Art and Shelby included\u2014the steaks that had been kept waiting. It was then that Luke learned more about Shelby\u2019s life than he had made time to ask. Shelby\u2019s cousin Vanni\u2019s first husband, Matt, was a fighting marine who lost his life in Baghdad; Paul was his best friend and the best man at their wedding. After Matt was gone, it was Paul who was with her for the birth of their child and, after a lot of stumbling, finally confessed to Vanni that he\u2019d loved her since the first moment he\u2019d laid eyes on her\u2014but Matt had gotten to her first. No self-respecting man invades his buddy\u2019s territory. And now they were together, Paul parenting his best friend\u2019s son. The romance of the story made Maureen sigh and fan at tears that gathered in her eyes.</p><p>Shelby shared other stories of the town\u2014how Mel came to Virgin River after the violent death of her first husband, the saga of Brie and Mike, how Preacher found Paige and built a life and family he never expected to have. Maureen was enchanted by the history of Luke\u2019s friends, history Luke hadn\u2019t even known. Luke knew few of the details about the people who\u2019d become his friends. Men don\u2019t share stories in the same way women do.</p><p>Thanksgiving Day was a stellar success at the general\u2019s house. Maureen met the rest of the family, there was a lot of laughter and the family stories that were shared were the safe kind, unlikely to ruffle any feathers. He was proud of his mother. She was a force of life, with her strong good looks, humor, compassion, energy. And there was not so much as a glimpse of her rigid side. It was obvious after getting to know her even a little bit that she was on the proper, straitlaced side, but she only judged her sons, no one else.</p><p>With a jolt, he realized\u2014she gave him credibility. He\u2019d been accepted well enough, but he remained a mystery to the Booth household, to the town. Known as a career soldier, single but interested in women, solitary, he presented himself as the kind of guy it wasn\u2019t easy to get close to. Enter Maureen, and he becomes a beloved son, the kind of generous man who would take on Art, a safe man for Shelby, a normal guy from whom good things should be expected. The way he was regarded by the general and Paul took a slow but noticeable turn; they treated him like one of the family, like someone they could trust rather than someone to be suspicious of.</p><p>Any normal guy would be grateful. Relieved. But for Luke it presented complications. It was bad enough worrying about Shelby\u2019s expectations, but he could keep that under control. He didn\u2019t know what the hell he\u2019d do with the expectations of her family, of an entire town who\u2019d recently begun to see him as a trustworthy man with honorable intentions.</p> <p>It left him quiet. Morose. And at the same time, very ready for Maureen and Sean to go, give him back his private life with Shelby, who he was aching to hold, to make love to.</p><p>And finally Sunday morning came. The bags were packed, Art had breakfast with them before heading down to the river to fish, and Sean was ready to take his mother to the airport. He\u2019d drive her to Sacramento and put her on a plane to Phoenix, then he would make the trip back north to Beale AFB where he was stationed.</p><p>Luke took a mug of coffee out onto his porch. The sun was shining, but it had gotten cold. He had a morning fire blazing in the hearth. It wasn\u2019t long before Maureen came outside, wearing her jacket, holding her own cup of coffee.</p><p>\u201cAll set?\u201d Luke asked.</p><p>\u201cReady. Sean\u2019s using your shower. He should be done in ten, fifteen minutes. I thought maybe you and I could have that time. We haven\u2019t really talked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been together for five days,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cAlmost a record.\u201d But he knew that wasn\u2019t what she meant.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since Felicia, Luke,\u201d she said gently. And she lifted her cup to her lips.</p><p>\u201cLong time,\u201d he agreed. \u201cI\u2019m over that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe was the exception, not the rule,\u201d Maureen said. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t assume relationships can\u2019t work just because you were treated badly by one woman.\u201d</p><p>Luke said nothing, but what he wanted to scream was Badly? Badly? I thought she was having my baby and I came back from a war to find out it wasn\u2019t mine!</p><p>\u201cShelby is a wonderful young woman. You\u2019re good together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t just her. Oh, it\u2019s obvious she loves you. But it\u2019s also you. The second she\u2019s near you, all those tense lines in your face relax and you soften up. That grumpy, self-protective shield drops and you\u2019re warm and affectionate. She\u2019s good for you, she brings out your best, makes you fun. You have something special with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s twenty-five.\u201d</p><p>Maureen shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s relevant. It doesn\u2019t seem to have anything to do with how you two communicate...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are things you don\u2019t understand about Shelby,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s not just young, she hasn\u2019t had many relationships. She\u2019s been taking care of her mother and hasn\u2019t really looked at the world. In a lot of ways, she\u2019s a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know all about her mother, but she\u2019s no child,\u201d Maureen said. \u201cIt takes maturity and courage to do what she did. So she didn\u2019t have a lot of relationships with young men, it doesn\u2019t mean she lacks worldly experience. And your age doesn\u2019t matter to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will. I\u2019m too old. I\u2019m not going to stand still while she gets older. She\u2019ll be thirty-five and I\u2019ll be almost fifty. She\u2019d find herself with an old man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt fifty?\u201d She laughed. \u201cI liked fifty,\u201d she said with a dismissive shrug. \u201cFifty was good. I was only twenty-three when I married your father and I never thought of him as too old for me. To the contrary, it made me feel better in so many ways, to be with a mature man, a man of experience who didn\u2019t have doubts anymore. He was stable and solid. It brought me comfort. And he was awful good to me.\u201d</p><p>Luke straightened his shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m not getting married. Shelby will move on, Mom. She wants a career. A young husband. She wants a family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know this?\u201d Maureen asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course I know that,\u201d he said. \u201cYou think we haven\u2019t talked? I didn\u2019t lead her on. And she didn\u2019t lead me on. She knows I don\u2019t want a wife, don\u2019t want children...\u201d</p><p>Maureen was quiet for a long moment. Finally she said, \u201cYou did once.\u201d</p><p>Luke let go a short laugh that was tinged with his inner rage. \u201cI\u2019m cured of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to think about this. The way you\u2019ve managed your life since Felicia hasn\u2019t exactly brought you peace. I suppose it\u2019s normal when a man gets hurt to avoid anything risky for a while, but not for thirteen years, Luke. If the right person comes along, don\u2019t assume it can\u2019t work just because it didn\u2019t work once, a long, long time ago. I know this young woman as well as I ever knew Felicia. Luke, Shelby is nothing like her. Nothing.\u201d</p><p>Luke pursed his lips, looked away for a second and then took a slow sip of coffee. \u201cThank you, Mom. I\u2019ll remember that.\u201d</p><p>She stepped toward him. \u201cIt\u2019s going to hurt just as much to let her go as it hurt you to be tossed away by Felicia. Remember that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the one guilty of assumptions here,\u201d he said impatiently. \u201cWhat makes you think all people want a tidy little marriage and children? Huh? I\u2019ve been damn happy the past dozen years. I\u2019ve been challenged and successful in my own way, I\u2019ve had a good time, good friends, a few relationships...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been treading water,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re marking the years, not living them. There\u2019s more to life, Luke. I hope you let yourself see\u2014you\u2019re in such a good place right now\u2014you can have it all. You put in your army years and it left you with a pension while you\u2019re still young. You\u2019re healthy, smart, accomplished, and you have a good woman. She\u2019s devoted to you. There\u2019s no reason you have to be alone for the rest of your life. It\u2019s not too late.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d met her soft gaze while she talked but now he turned away from her instead of arguing. He didn\u2019t see it that way; he thought it was too late. What he saw was a beautiful young woman agreeing to life with him, having a child or two, then waking up one morning to realize she hadn\u2019t really lived yet. She\u2019d have gone from her mother\u2019s sickbed to Luke. She would still be young, beautiful, vibrant and sorry she hadn\u2019t looked a little further, for someone with more to offer her. Maureen was wrong. If that happened, if Shelby gave him a few years and then came to her senses and walked away, it was going to hurt a lot more. A lot more.</p><p>She spoke quietly to his back. \u201cListen, I have no idea what possessed Felicia to do the things she did. She could have had everything with you\u2014finding a man who knows what he wants and cherishes it every day, that\u2019s not easy. But she was so foolish and shortsighted. On a stupid whim she gave it up. Maybe she thought she had logical reasons. She had a chance to have it all. But she walked away from a good man, a good life, a hopeful future.\u201d</p><p>Luke turned around and there was anger in his eyes. \u201cStop it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to draw me any more pictures. I know Shelby is nothing like Felicia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t talking about Shelby,\u201d Maureen said. \u201cI was talking about you. In this case you\u2019d be the one in love who, on a stupid, illogical whim, throws it away. Think, Luke. Don\u2019t throw away the best chance at happiness you might ever get.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStop it,\u201d he said softly, in a desperate plea.</p><p>Maureen wasn\u2019t easily intimidated. \u201cYou\u2019ve held on to this anger way too long. It\u2019s time to let yourself have the life you really want.\u201d</p><p>They locked eyes for long seconds. Then Sean bounced out of the house, all smiles. \u201cWell, we ready to head out? Mom? Luke?\u201d</p> <p>It took a second for them to recover themselves. \u201cSure am,\u201d Maureen said, handing off her coffee cup to Sean. \u201cJust let me go down to the river and say goodbye to Art.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I should do that, too,\u201d Sean said, handing Luke the cup. \u201cThen let\u2019s make tracks, huh?\u201d</p><p>Luke waited by Sean\u2019s car until they came back. His mother was smiling that enormous smile of hers, green eyes twinkling. \u201cLuke, honey, it was wonderful. I love your house and cabins, your town, your new friends. I think if you decided to stay right here, you might like it.\u201d She went to him and gave him a kiss on the cheek. \u201cThank you so much for everything. I\u2019ll talk to you soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReal soon,\u201d Luke said. \u201cSean, drive carefully. Get her there in one piece.\u201d</p><p>Luke was brooding long after his mother and brother left. He knew what point she was trying to make. He could even give her credit for making some sense, but what she didn\u2019t understand was that even if he could work up the courage to take that kind of risk, it was impossible for him to put Shelby through a challenge like that. She was young and fresh. He was not. He was seasoned, bruised and holding back how he felt was by now a habit.</p> <p>He could\u2019ve worked on one of the cabins, but he didn\u2019t. He puttered. There weren\u2019t even breakfast dishes to clean up\u2014his mother had done that. He laundered the sheets and towels. He wandered from the house to the porch and back again. At one point he saw Art come back from the river. He waved at Luke and went into his cabin for a while, then back to the river. Lunch break? Luke thought about getting him a little more gear just to ring his chimes\u2014maybe a canvas vest, a creel, a fancy fisherman\u2019s hat.</p><p>Luke loved his mother so much. He held her in such high esteem, and he hated that he\u2019d disappointed her. It wasn\u2019t a question of what he wanted, it was a matter of survival\u2014didn\u2019t she get that?</p><p>She really annoyed him with her theories. He had to remind himself where she was coming from. She wasn\u2019t like women of his generation. She\u2019d been considering the convent, although he\u2019d seen pictures of her and she was a beautiful young woman; boys and men must have been after her all the time. But, being the prude she was, she hadn\u2019t slipped an inch. Although she wouldn\u2019t speak of indelicate things, Luke\u2019s father had said their mother was pure as the driven snow. Luke took that to mean a twenty-three-year-old virgin, a rarity in these days. Luke didn\u2019t run into women like that.</p><p>Until lately.</p><p>But that was a whole different thing\u2014Shelby. She wasn\u2019t necessarily a virgin because she had been saving herself, but because she\u2019d had no opportunities. That was what Shelby needed now\u2014opportunities. Education, career, experience and, yes, a few more men so she could learn for herself what worked best for her. It wasn\u2019t a good idea for a young woman of Shelby\u2019s intelligence, curiosity and gratitude for the good things in life to get herself stuck. Just because Luke was the first didn\u2019t make him the best. God, he was hardly the best....</p><p>Still, there was a part of him that wished his mother\u2019s fantasy could be real\u2014that you accidentally find this person, this one ideal person, and you dive in, not wasting a minute, and make her yours. And then everything for the next thirty or forty or fifty years is just one big lovefest. Unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t just his bad experience he drew from. He\u2019d been around a lot of men the last twenty years and too few of them had relationships that held strong; too many had been fucked over by a woman. Being a big tough guy, he didn\u2019t get into emotional conversations with men by habit, but as a matter of fact he\u2019d held a few young, sobbing soldiers as they grieved lost love. The same men who could go into a bloody battle fearlessly could be brought to their knees by a woman who couldn\u2019t keep her promises.</p> <p>His mother didn\u2019t know what she was talking about. His mother didn\u2019t understand him, he groused. She meant well, wanted the best for him, but she was pie-in-the-sky delusional.</p><p>And then Shelby drove up to his house. It was early afternoon and Shelby had known his mother and brother were scheduled to leave in the morning. She came. He stood from his chair on the porch and watched her get out of her Jeep, her hair full and free as he liked it. She wore tight jeans and boots, a down vest over her turtleneck sweater, and she stood there beside her car, smiling at him. She could have waited for him to show up at Jack\u2019s, or to call her and tell her the coast was clear. But she didn\u2019t wait, she came.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Art?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cFishing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she said, grinning.</p><p>He forgot everything he\u2019d been dwelling on. He smiled at her and never even felt all the tension drain from his face, his neck and shoulders. He laughed and hooked his thumbs in the pockets of his jeans. She slammed her car door and ran up the porch steps; she lunged at him, her arms around his neck, her legs around his waist, her lips on his lips. She laughed against his open mouth, but only for a moment.</p><p>He devoured that sweet mouth, holding her up. He couldn\u2019t move from his spot on the porch. All that was important to him at the moment was having her in his arms, tasting her, smelling her, feeling his mouth on her mouth. \u201cI\u2019ll slow down,\u201d he promised against her lips. \u201cI\u2019ll take some time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she said in her own breathless whisper. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to slow down for me, because I\u2019m in a big hurry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh God,\u201d he whispered, weak. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure I\u2019m dying for you, Luke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d he said again. And he found his way into the house. He carried her like that straight to the bedroom and fell with her onto the bed.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t get away any sooner,\u201d she said while pulling at his clothes. He began to peel away her clothes at the same time. The vest and sweater went first; his shirt was flung from the bed to the floor. \u201cAnd I wasn\u2019t exactly sure when\u2014\u201d</p><p>He stilled her with his mouth on hers, hungry and aching.</p><p>She wrestled free of his lips and said, \u201cBoots, Luke. We have to get rid of the boots.\u201d</p><p>He laughed a loud, lusty laugh. \u201cBe interesting, doing it in only boots. Let\u2019s take off the jeans and put the boots back on...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone could get hurt,\u201d she said. \u201cHurry up.\u201d</p><p>He thought he\u2019d die, having her like this, rushing him, needing him. \u201cThis an emergency, honey?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cOh, man,\u201d she said, tugging at his lips. \u201cBoots. Take care of the boots!\u201d</p><p>He got an evil, amused glint in his eyes. He pulled off his boots, then hers, very slowly. It was fun, Shelby in a wild state. Holding her pleading eyes in his hot gaze, he grabbed her wrists, held them over her head and gently kissed her body, on top of her bra, on her belly, on her chin, on her neck. She laughed at him. \u201cWill you please!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeed something?\u201d he asked teasingly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been turned on all day, just waiting for you to be alone again.\u201d</p><p>He leisurely unsnapped her jeans and slipped his hand down over her flat belly.</p><p>\u201cLuke!\u201d she scolded. \u201cWe can play later!\u201d</p><p>It made him laugh. He released her arms, pulled off the bra, pulled down the jeans and got rid of his own. Against her lips he said, \u201cI\u2019m going to last two minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I have one minute in me,\u201d she answered.</p><p>He lifted her legs for her, teased her a little bit, and then he went in for the kill. But Shelby was way ahead of him, hungrier than he was, which seemed impossible to him. Her legs came around his waist and within seconds she was astounding him with a shattering climax, sending him reeling into another world. He groaned low in his throat while he held on, letting her ride it out. And when she was on the way down from the experience, he let go. A week of tension, worry, doubt and paranoia pulsed out of him. He was in the only place he wanted to be.</p><p>Then there was the part he\u2019d come to love as much\u2014holding her while she returned to the world, conscious of their surroundings, relieved and appeased, flushed, happy. She laughed softly. \u201cThat was embarrassing,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat have you done to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing you didn\u2019t do right back to me,\u201d he said. He gave her a kiss. \u201cI missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but it was a good week,\u201d she said. \u201cWhew. We\u2019re too new to have separations like that, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hated my mother every night,\u201d he said as he slipped out of her.</p><p>\u201cAw. She\u2019s great. You\u2019re lucky, you have a wonderful mother.\u201d</p><p>He settled onto his side and pulled her close. Funny, the thing that came to his mind first was that he had learned more about Shelby\u2019s life by listening to her talk to his mother than he had from their time together, which had been intense and intimate. Something about that made him feel bad.</p><p>\u201cTell me about your mother,\u201d he said, hugging her.</p><p>\u201cShe was fantastic. If my mother had lived, our mothers would have liked each other. Before she got sick, she was such a bundle of energy. She was beautiful\u2014I\u2019ll show you pictures sometime. She always worked. She had to, of course\u2014my dad left us before I was even born. My Uncle Walt was a huge help, but still... Even though she worked full-time, she still made it to every concert or game or school thing I had going on. Not only did she make time for me to have girlfriends over, we were like chums. Everyone else hated their mothers, they were fighting all the time, but I was shopping and going to movies with mine.\u201d She got a little sniffly and said, \u201cI\u2019m so damn grateful we had that when I was a teenager. It\u2019s not the usual way, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said, brushing her hair away from her face.</p><p>\u201cYou do? Were you fighting with your parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have four brothers. Everyone was fighting. We still fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, how can you say that, now? Sean is so sweet....\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop saying nice things about him,\u201d Luke said. \u201cHe\u2019s a troublemaker. So tell me some more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure? It\u2019s boring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWell, after she slowed down and needed me, we couldn\u2019t get out much together anymore, but that didn\u2019t keep us from having fun. We both loved to read\u2014I read to her till late in the night. I read all of Gone with the Wind and Anna Karenina, even though we\u2019d both read them before. We loved those old, rich, deep, complicated romances. And we used to watch chick flicks\u2014and cry. Then we\u2019d talk about them\u2014about what the girls did that was stupid, what the guys did that was inadequate, and of course what they did totally right. We\u2019d develop our \u2018perfect man\u2019 fantasies around those characters. We were kind of alike, you know. She hadn\u2019t had a perfect man, either. We\u2019d talk about the best things a man could say to just bring you to your knees. Like the Jerry Maguire line\u2014you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Jerry Maguire?\u201d he asked, running his hand over her bare shoulder.</p><p>\u201cTom Cruise,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s short.\u201d</p><p>Shelby grinned at him. \u201cSo am I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cWhat did he say? What was the line? I\u2019m always looking for a good line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou complete me.\u201d</p><p>Luke\u2019s eyebrows rose. \u201cReally? What does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make me whole...\u201d He frowned at her. \u201cI\u2019m not a whole person without you. You know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could pull that one off.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cWe used to make up our own best lines. And talk about what the perfect man would be like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was your perfect man like?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cNothing like you,\u201d she said. \u201cBut then everything changed and it became you....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was your perfect line?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just silly....\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, tell me. I want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a line. A fantasy line. You can\u2019t steal it\u2014it wouldn\u2019t be the same if I fed it to you. And if you use it on some other woman, I\u2019m going to tell my Uncle Walt you did something horrible to me so he kills you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShelby, we\u2019re naked and just had unbelievable sex\u2014death threats right now are rude. Mind your manners. Tell me the perfect line.\u201d</p><p>She was quiet for a minute. She chewed on her bottom lip a little, thinking it over. Then in a very soft voice she said, \u201cYou\u2019re all I need. To be happy.\u201d Then she lifted her eyelids and connected with his eyes. She smiled shyly. \u201cJust a line. Writing screenplays or romantic novels was once on my to-do dream list.\u201d</p><p>He ran his hand over her honey hair. He kissed her temple. \u201cShelby,\u201d he said softly, \u201cI think you\u2019re all I need to be happy.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him for a long time. She smiled into his eyes. \u201cIn my fantasy, he doesn\u2019t say \u2018I think.\u2019\u201d Then she laughed and said, \u201cSo\u2014did your mother convince you to go to Phoenix for Christmas? She said she was going to try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might go\u2014but for two days. I\u2019m not doing this five-day thing again. I can\u2019t take it when we\u2019re back together. You almost killed me.\u201d He grinned. \u201cDo you realize you went from self-conscious little virgin to aggressor? Shelby, you\u2019ve come out of your shell. Way out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you brought me out, ever think of that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou must\u2019ve been ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I was ready,\u201d she said. She put a hand against his cheek. \u201cFor you.\u201d</p><p>It was the Saturday following Thanksgiving and Walt wasn\u2019t sure he could remember ever lying in bed with a naked woman in the middle of the afternoon. When he was a young man, not only was the army working him to death, the first baby came along soon after he and Peg married and from that point on their lives were entwined with family and the demands of a military officer\u2019s life. When he became a general, he also had an aide and some household staff. It wasn\u2019t that they were inhibited, neither of them were, but the second they tried something as daring as showering together, one of their teenagers would come home unexpectedly and bang on their door, yelling, \u201cWhat are you doing in there?\u201d</p><p>There was definitely something to be said for being consenting adults of a certain age. He chuckled to himself.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s funny?\u201d Muriel asked, nuzzling closer.</p><p>\u201cYeah. You and me. Stealing sex in the afternoon with a couple of lazy dogs sleeping at the foot of the bed. This is good, Muriel. Good. And I\u2019m glad there are no ceiling mirrors.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him. \u201cMe, too. Let\u2019s not think about what we must look like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not what we used to look like, but you still have the body of a girl. You do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKnow what I like best about you?\u201d she asked. \u201cYour intelligence. Even though you\u2019re a liar, you know exactly what to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, this might be the wrong thing to say, but I\u2019m going to say it anyway. I haven\u2019t had sex since Peg died. Until you.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her chin up, looking at him. \u201cWalt, I haven\u2019t had sex since before Peg died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d he asked, surprised. \u201cThat\u2019s amazing. You\u2019re made for sex.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cThere was probably a compliment in there somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious. You\u2019re a wonderful lover. Partner. That\u2019s not too encroaching, is it? Partner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t cross the line, but it rushes right up to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to think of us as casual....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cCasual is coffee or drinks. Intimate is\u2014\u201d</p><p>The phone rang in her bedroom. She rolled away to pick it up and Walt grabbed her arm, pulling her back. \u201cIntimate is what?\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cVery, very nice. May I answer the phone now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny of your close friends or family members dying?\u201d he wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cNot to my knowledge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how about we don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalt, I\u2019m answering my phone,\u201d she said, rolling away from him. \u201cHello?\u201d she said into the phone. \u201cHi, Jack, what\u2019s up? Oh really? Is his name Mason? Yes, you can give him directions, he\u2019s my agent. And Jack\u2014thanks for asking first. That was thoughtful of you. He could be anyone, you know.\u201d When she rolled back to Walt, she just sighed. \u201cA man in a funny hat driving a Bentley just showed up at Jack\u2019s asking if he knew where I lived. Mason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell if I know. But I suspect he\u2019s got some big idea or script or something and thought if he pressured me in person, it would make a difference. It won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you tell Jack to give him directions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, now listen. Mason can annoy me with his focus on my career even after I\u2019m trying to get away from movies, but he\u2019s been a good and loyal friend for over thirty-five years and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd an ex-husband,\u201d Walt pointed out.</p><p>\u201cWe hardly notice that,\u201d she said. \u201cSeriously, I owe Mason. He\u2019s gotten me out of some tight spots. My business can get real complicated. And he might get a little zooped up over projects that aren\u2019t all they appear to be, but if he ever sees that something isn\u2019t going as it should for my career, he steps in like a lion and gets it handled. So let\u2019s get dressed and be cordial. Hmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell you what,\u201d Walt said. \u201cLet\u2019s meet him in our birthday suits so he knows how it is with us. How about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just plain cruel. You\u2019re the only one I plan to subject to that sight. Now, be civil to Mason. He\u2019ll go away much sooner if you just play nice and let me handle him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to slip into the shower,\u201d Walt said.</p><p>\u201cOh, come on. You\u2019re being a little obvious, don\u2019t you think?\u201d she asked, drawing up her jeans.</p><p>\u201cWhen he asks who\u2019s in the shower, you\u2019ll say, Walt\u2014my beyond-casual and not-legally-partnered boyfriend who isn\u2019t going away without a fight anytime soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She laughed. \u201cBe sure you\u2019re dressed when you come downstairs.\u201d</p><p>Muriel let Mason in the front door ten minutes later. She hugged him; he fussed over her beauty, though she wore no makeup and hadn\u2019t had a manicure or pedicure in months. He was shorter than her, wore a cashmere sports coat, Gucci shoes and a burgundy beret on his balding head. He had a salt-and-pepper beard and crystal blue eyes that were looking a little too alive. He either had a special script or was on crack.</p><p>By the time she was serving him a cup of tea in her brand-new kitchen, Walt appeared. Dressed.</p><p>\u201cMason, I\u2019d like you to meet Walt Booth, my\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSignificant other,\u201d he said, putting out his hand. He glanced askance at Muriel with a lifted brow, challenging her. She just shook her head and chuckled.</p><p>\u201cWalt is my neighbor and very good friend. Very. Good.\u201d</p><p>Walt helped himself to a beer from her refrigerator, demonstrating that he was not a guest.</p><p>\u201cNow, Mason,\u201d Muriel said. \u201cLet\u2019s skip the suspense. What brings you all the way to Virgin River.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, here it is. I hoped you\u2019d come to the house for Thanksgiving so we could talk about it, but since you didn\u2019t... I have an Oscar script, written for you. It\u2019s a romantic comedy, but it\u2019s got some serious teeth. Jack Nicholson wants you to costar. Only you. He\u2019s prepared to go to contract if you\u2019ll take the part. This is your shot, Muriel. This is it. I know I\u2019ve thrown you a lot of crap that you turned down, probably wisely, but you have to look at this one. The producers are loaded and are courting three of the best Oscar-winning directors in the business.\u201d</p><p>Dead silence and absence of movement reigned. Muriel knew the fact that she said nothing caused Walt to stiffen nervously. He was no doubt accustomed to her saying no immediately.</p><p>\u201cYou brought the script?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Read it. At least talk to them. No matter how you feel about working, if I let you turn this down without thinking it through, I should be jailed as a fraud.\u201d</p><p>She stood. \u201cWell, then. Let\u2019s get you comfortable in the guesthouse. Walt, stay put. I\u2019ll be right back. This way, Mason,\u201d she said, exiting the kitchen and leading him through the front door.</p><p>She took Mason and a couple of suitcases to her old abode and came back ten minutes later with a script. Walt was seated at the table, waiting.</p><p>Without preamble, she said, \u201cHere\u2019s how this kind of thing usually goes. I could love everything about this project and after I make a commitment, Nicholson and the directors all disappear and we have to make do with whoever will step up to the plate. When I was actively working, I could afford to take chances like that\u2014we\u2019d always salvage a decent film in the end. But without even looking at this,\u201d she said, holding up the script, \u201cI\u2019m damn sure not leaving my horses or my new house or you for something that isn\u2019t carved in stone. Do you understand, Walt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s staying?\u201d was all Walt said in reply.</p><p>Mason Fielding only stayed overnight and at midmorning the next day was on his way back to L.A. Early in the afternoon, Walt rode Liberty up to Muriel\u2019s house and waited while she saddled her Palomino mare, Sweety. Buff had to stay behind, but Luce was out in front, blazing their trail along the river until Muriel cut loose that piercing whistle of hers, bringing the Lab back to heel.</p><p>The air was cold; the steam rose from the horses\u2019 nostrils. There was no snow yet, but if the clouds rolled in, the air was cold enough to support a nice white cover.</p><p>\u201cDid you look at that script?\u201d Walt asked her.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. Read it twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwice?\u201d he asked, astonished.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a shooting script. It\u2019s just a hundred and thirty-five pages of dialogue. I read down the middle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good. It could use a tweak or two, but it\u2019s inspired. The writer\u2019s been coming along. This is pretty much what everyone\u2019s been waiting for from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA woman, yes. This would be only her second feature film and her first was highly acclaimed. She was a very young playwright when she began her career. Now she\u2019s about my age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d he said, knowing so little about this business. \u201cGood enough to consider?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood enough to talk about considering it. I haven\u2019t said anything to Mason yet. I\u2019m still in the pondering stage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you say talk about considering it, what does that involve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting all the principals together in meetings, ironing out details, determining stars and supporting cast, directors, etcetera.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean going back to L.A.?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cMaybe not. Actors and directors are often on location when deals are being set up. Conference calls work just fine. This is the kind of script that, done well, could be everything. But if a couple of things slip through the cracks or the right cast can\u2019t come together for the production, could be just another mildly entertaining film.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAren\u2019t a lot of scripts like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really, no. You know what most of them are going to turn out to be from the get-go. This one really does have great potential. But I think the thing that appeals to me the most\u2014I could play myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs in\u2014yourself?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cAn unfancy woman who lives in the country and isn\u2019t crazy about a lot of Hollywood flash. I think the script flirts with being autobiographical. It\u2019s about a writer who hates Hollywood and lives on a nonworking farm with animals who are pets\u2014dogs, horses, goats. Because she\u2019s gifted, an actor comes to her asking her to write a script that will make his career before it\u2019s too late\u2014he\u2019s no longer young. They have nothing and everything in common and the relationship is complex while they hammer out a script together\u2014sometimes hilarious, sometimes very sentimental and touching. Passionate in places. Lots of emotion. And no backless gowns or jewelry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking about it,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help myself. I\u2019ve always seen myself in roles like this, with the right people involved, but they rarely presented themselves. It\u2019s a life-transition film, like On Golden Pond with slightly younger lead actors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaking a comeback?\u201d he asked. \u201cA starlet returning to the big screen?\u201d</p><p>She shot him a look of horror. She reined in her horse. \u201cAll right, let\u2019s get something straight. I\u2019m not an aging starlet and I wouldn\u2019t consider it a comeback. I\u2019m an actor and to me this is serious work. A challenge I\u2019m up to. In my business the opportunities that are truly good are rare. But I\u2019m no aging starlet, Walt. I work for a living. And the job isn\u2019t easy. But the rewards, if you do the job well, can be good. Not the least of which is pride.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to cut me some slack,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know much about your business. I didn\u2019t say you were an aging starlet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thought it,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t prove that.\u201d</p><p>She let out her breath. Slowly, as if deciding on something. She eased up on the reins.</p><p>\u201cHmm. Sounds like you\u2019d like to do it,\u201d he ventured.</p><p>She was quiet for a moment. Then she said, \u201cLike the main character, I wouldn\u2019t like being away from here.\u201d She looked at him. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t like being away from you, either, and don\u2019t let that go to your head.\u201d</p> <p>That brought a small smile to his lips. And then he laughed. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInflated your ego, did I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that,\u201d he said. \u201cI had a moment of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. I don\u2019t know how much you know about the military, Muriel, but each special training program or promotion or new assignment incurs another commitment. To go from captain to major gives the army four more years of you. Go to flight school, sign up for four more years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. Your d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first twenty years were a no-brainer. I already had eight and owed four more when I met Peg. When I hit my twenty and could retire on a colonel\u2019s pension, Vanni was eleven and Tom wasn\u2019t even a twinkle in my eye. I had the potential to go further and, like your script, it could all fall apart at any moment if the right players weren\u2019t on board. Or I could go all the way. Not only that, my assignments were getting more complicated\u2014the Pentagon, war zones, attach\u00e9 to diplomatic service abroad. Every time I reached one of those forks, I\u2019d sit down with Peg. I\u2019d tell her what was involved, tried to be frank about the sacrifices that not only I but the whole family would have to make, and I\u2019d always wrap it up by saying, \u2018I can stop right now and be happy. If you ask me to say no, I will.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Muriel was gloomily quiet. She wasn\u2019t giving him that kind of choice. Even though she liked her life right now, she\u2019d decide for herself.</p><p>\u201cNow, Peg, she was a very independent woman, but in some ways she was dependent on me. Naturally. As a partner, a father to her children, a provider\u2014she needed me. And I needed her. In the end she would always say\u2014you have to fulfill every ambition you have, go where you can do the most good, and we\u2019ll stand behind you while you do. And she never once made me regret it. Sometimes it was damn hard on her.\u201d</p><p>Muriel chewed on that for a moment. \u201cShe must have been a remarkable woman.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe was,\u201d Walt said easily. He reached over to her and grabbed her hand. \u201cSo are you, Muriel. A remarkable woman. It\u2019s my turn to say it. You have to fulfill every ambition. I wouldn\u2019t like being away from you, either. But I\u2019ll be right here, rooting for you every step of the way. Proudly.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him with absolute love, though neither of them had uttered such a binding word. Her eyes glistened and she had to purse her lips to keep them from trembling. Men had said wonderful things to her over the years, lavish compliments about her beauty and wit, but never anything like this. She blinked. She took a deep breath. Then she said, \u201cStop it. I don\u2019t cry. Not unless the director says, \u2018Cry.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Walt laughed at her and leaned over, sidling up against her and, with an arm around her shoulders, pulled her near. \u201cWould you have to be naked in this one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBriefly. Would that bother you?\u201d</p><p>He grinned devilishly. \u201cNot in the way you think.\u201d</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>For the couple of weeks following Thanksgiving, things around Virgin River were far more hectic than usual and every hand was needed. It started with the erection of a huge Christmas tree between the bar and the boarded-up church. As Luke understood it, this was only the second year the town had put up such a tree, and it was a major project. Every available man was needed to chop it, haul it into town, stand it up and, with the use of a rented cherry picker, string the lights and decorate the highest parts. It was trimmed in red, white and blue and hung with gold stars and military-unit patches. It was meant to be a tribute to the men and women who stood the watch, and when Luke saw what they were doing, it made him feel, without a doubt, he\u2019d chosen the right town. It was the first time he\u2019d felt truly at home in years.</p><p>Right after the tree lighting, there were three new residences finished and three families to relocate before Christmas. Luke was more than willing to help.</p><p>Preacher and Paige had to be moved back into their new enlarged quarters behind the bar. Then Paul transferred his small family along with furniture into his house on the other side of the general\u2019s stable. And finally, the Valenzuelas were moved into their new home next door to the Sheridans. Throughout this process, Brie was much in evidence, staying busy while she got ready for two major events\u2014moving into her own new house and giving birth. A number of people watched over Brie protectively, making sure she wasn\u2019t taking on too much. Mike Valenzuela was always within earshot of his wife and Jack kept a close eye on his little sister.</p><p>Brie had put the last piece of folded clothing in the last drawer when her first labor pain hit\u2014two weeks before Christmas. Jack, almost as excited as if it was his own child coming into the world, told everyone who came in the bar that Brie had been in labor most of the day. Mike called him with updates. Whoever heard of a bartender reporting on centimeters and time between contractions? But Jack did.</p><p>That\u2019s when things took a crazy spin that Luke allowed himself to be swept up in. Shelby was looking after Mel\u2019s little ones so she could attend Brie in childbirth, so Luke happened to be at the bar when the call came that Brie was in the last stages of labor. The place came alive. \u201cMel says she\u2019s getting close,\u201d Jack reported. \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d</p><p>Luke had no idea what was happening. He meant to quietly slip away so these people could live their lives, when Preacher called him to the kitchen and started snapping orders. \u201cLuke, help me pack this stuff up. You can take the food so I can help Paige load up the kids. Jack will get some good liquor and cigars. Paige\u2014call Paul and Vanni and tell them it\u2019s happening. They\u2019ll make sure the general gets the word.\u201d Luke had no choice but to do as he was told; he boxed up what Preacher pulled out of the freezer, refrigerator and pantry\u2014barbecue, buns, chips, pickles, creamy coleslaw, pie. He added salmon fillets, seasoned and ready to broil and a big container of rice and peas. A bag of premade salad and a big cheesecake. He saw Jack hurry past him with a box of liquor and cigars. It took only a few minutes before Preacher said, \u201cSee you out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Luke asked dumbly.</p><p>\u201cBrie and Mike\u2019s. We\u2019re having a party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d</p><p>Preacher drew a patient breath. \u201cBrie\u2019s having the baby. We all go when there\u2019s a baby, if it\u2019s not the middle of the night. But they\u2019ve barely moved in\u2014I don\u2019t know what they have for food and drink. I think there\u2019s a little more than usual here. We can leave some behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute,\u201d Luke said. \u201cIsn\u2019t she in the hospital?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Preacher answered, as if confused by the question. \u201cShe\u2019s going to have the baby with Mel and Dr. Stone at home. Enough talking.\u201d</p><p>So he went, and all the way there he was thinking, I hope they don\u2019t make me get too close to this thing. He decided straight off, he wasn\u2019t sticking around. This whole baby business wasn\u2019t his cup of tea.</p><p>He found the house filled with people\u2014Vanni and Paige were in the great room with small children\u2014one in a swing, two in playpens, young Christopher on the couch watching an animated movie. Jack held David balanced on his hip in a kitchen full of men. Preacher was setting up pans on the stove, the general was mixing drinks and Paul was putting out small plates, napkins and utensils. Luke put down the large box of food and said he\u2019d just get going.</p><p>\u201cOh, hell no, you\u2019re not going anywhere,\u201d Jack said. \u201cMy sister\u2019s having a baby, her first, and this is the cheering section.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute here,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not real big on babies. We\u2019ve been over this\u2014I have no idea what to do with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, for God\u2019s sake, we\u2019re not going to make you do anything.\u201d Jack laughed. \u201cYou know how to eat, raise a glass, smoke a cigar? The delivery team is taking care of the messy stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t it be real quiet around here? Fewer people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be quiet, we\u2019ll stay out of the way.\u201d Preacher handed Jack a bottle for David. \u201cThis guy\u2019s going to break in the new crib. Say good-night, David.\u201d The boy had the bottle in his mouth that fast, leaned his head against Jack\u2019s shoulder sleepily and opened and closed the fingers of one pudgy little hand, holding his bottle with the other.</p><p>\u201cWhat if she...\u201d Luke couldn\u2019t go on.</p><p>\u201cWhat if she what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScreams or something,\u201d he said squeamishly.</p><p>Jack put his free arm around Luke\u2019s shoulders. \u201cSee, you need to be here, buddy. It\u2019s time you learn about the cycle of life. You never know, this could happen to you someday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is not happening to me someday. I\u2019m way past all this.\u201d</p><p>A few male heads came up. There was some subdued laughter. \u201cIs that so?\u201d Jack said. \u201cCry me a river, pal, I was over forty when Mel tripped me up. We\u2019re all about the same age around here, except Preacher. He\u2019s still a pup, even though he looks older than the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>Walt handed Luke a drink. \u201cI was forty-four when Tom was born. I think I\u2019m holding up all right, to tell the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to come up with a better excuse,\u201d Jack said. \u201cBesides, I\u2019ve been wanting to ask you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I have a situation. We usually go to Sacramento for Christmas, but with no doctor in town and Brie just delivering, my family is coming here. There\u2019s a ton of them. I have the guesthouse for my dad, a couple of rooms if we double up the kids, and the cabin is free again. And this is a new Valenzuela baby coming\u2014wanna bet we\u2019ll be seeing a ton of Mexicans around here? Mike\u2019s family is bigger than mine. Buddy\u2014we are out of space. What\u2019s the status of those cabins? Got any ready to rent?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Luke lifted his eyebrows. This was unexpected. \u201cTell you what I\u2019ve got,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re habitable and the new appliances have been delivered but not installed, they need inside paint, and furniture has been ordered, not delivered. Thanks to Paul, all new roofs, windows and doors. The countertops and cupboards are installed, but I\u2019m still working on baseboards. I put in new hot-water heaters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you had a hand with the paint and appliances, think you could free up a couple by Christmas?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why not,\u201d Luke said. \u201cIf furniture can be delivered quickly. But, Jack, even with your help, that would be a push.\u201d</p> <p>Paul moved closer. \u201cWhere\u2019s your furniture coming from? Maybe we can pick it up with one of the company trucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEureka. Beds, sleeper sofas, small tables and chairs, etcetera. It was the next thing after paint and appliances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll get it done,\u201d Jack said. \u201cThat would be perfect. Otherwise, we\u2019re going to have to hang all these people from the trees. Be right back,\u201d he said, taking David off to bed.</p><p>Then suddenly Shelby appeared in the kitchen. She was smiling a sweet, secret smile, a very special light in her eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be here,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNeither did I.\u201d</p> <p>To the men in the kitchen she said, \u201cMel said to tell you it won\u2019t be much longer. And she said you are not to get drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t get drunk at birthing parties,\u201d Preacher said indignantly. Then he looked over his shoulder and said, \u201cExcept Paul. He got toasted after Matt was born, but that was a whole different thing.\u201d</p><p>Luke was focused on Shelby\u2019s smiling face. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI was helping with Mel\u2019s kids so she could be with Brie, but now that Vanni and Paige are here, I can observe,\u201d she said. \u201cBrie said it would be all right. I\u2019ve never seen a birth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re up to that?\u201d he wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said. She gave him a kiss on the cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p> <p>Luke made fast work of his first drink and was nursing his second, through many jokes and soft, respectful laughter, when Mike came into the great room holding a very small bundle wrapped in a pink receiving blanket. Mike went to the women first\u2014Paige and Vanni. While they were murmuring, smiling, beaming, the men moved in a crowd out of the kitchen to have a look at what Mike had for himself. The look on Mike\u2019s face was a combination of exhaustion and exhilaration\u2014just what would happen to a guy who\u2019d just helped and worried his way through labor with his wife while she produced this, his first child. His smile was huge; his eyes were bright inside and weary on the outside.</p><p>And that\u2019s when Luke started to remember. So long ago. So deep and buried. He migrated to Mike and the baby, smiling sentimentally, gently tugging back the pink wrap to get a better look at her. He even heard himself say, \u201cGood for you, man.\u201d</p><p>When Felicia first told him there was going to be a baby, she\u2019d been real upset. It was unplanned, she wasn\u2019t ready. But he had felt something inside him grow proudly. She told him to keep it to himself, she didn\u2019t want everyone to know before she even got used to the idea. But back then he\u2019d been so bonded with his men, his boys, he wasn\u2019t into secret-keeping, especially about things like this. He told them all; they toasted him, got him a little drunk and drove him home.</p><p>Against her wishes, he\u2019d called his mom and dad, his brothers. He had been all puffed up on testosterone pride, life had taken on new meaning for him. He never even tried to understand her cranky behavior\u2014he was a young buck with a baby coming and she was pregnant\u2014what was to understand? He put up with her pissy mood; he tried to be patient. He watched her begin to grow.</p><p>She told him it was a boy and it seemed like seconds after he learned the news, he got the call. Somalia. But it wasn\u2019t supposed to be long\u2014it was a peacekeeping mission. They\u2019d make a presence there with the Marine Corps and he\u2019d be back quickly. He felt he could do anything because waiting for him were his woman, his son. That euphoria stayed with him for so long, he assumed that was the way all men felt when they struck oil.</p><p>But it was ugly in Somalia; lives were lost in Mogadishu and it was in many ways a miracle there hadn\u2019t been more casualties. When he got home the first thing he could fill his eyes with was his wife\u2014she was huge. He should\u2019ve looked at her eyes first, but he couldn\u2019t help himself.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not yours,\u201d she said. He wasn\u2019t sure, but he thought she said that before she even said hello. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to tell you while you were on a mission, but you\u2019re back safe now. We\u2019re over. I\u2019m leaving. I\u2019m going with the father. I\u2019m sorry it happened this way. You shouldn\u2019t have been bragging about it. I told you not to.\u201d</p><p>In a flash he wondered how that came to be his fault\u2014being proud? At first he thought she was joking, some really sick joke. Then he thought there was a mistake; when had she had time for another man? He\u2019d been making love to her constantly. Next he thought she couldn\u2019t have done that to him\u2014not while he poured every cell of his body into adoring her.</p> <p>He wanted to kill someone. Her, maybe. Or the father, who turned out to be an officer in his command, a man whose orders he was obligated to follow. A man who\u2019d been with them in Somalia, knowing every day that he had a baby coming with another man\u2019s wife.</p><p>The months that followed blurred as he drank too much, avoided people, got in random fights, buried himself in a dark, black loneliness and wished he was dead. Before he got to remembering the scandal, the shame of having been made to look like a complete fool, the sympathy and pity, he felt a hand on his shoulder. \u201cHow about that, huh?\u201d Jack said to him, bringing him back. \u201cWhen have you seen anything as sweet as that?\u201d</p><p>Luke pushed it all back down again. Thirteen years had made him very adept at that\u2014shoving it underwater where it should all just drown. He smiled. \u201cLotta black hair on that little head,\u201d he said.</p><p>He briefly remembered how the happiest day of his life had been when his transfer orders finally came and he could get away from Felicia and her new partner. By that time he was lucky he had a career left in the army. He\u2019d been completely out of control there for a while and had been disciplined more than once. Given that he\u2019d performed heroically in Somalia and came home to a wife, nine months pregnant and leaving him, his commanders cut him a little slack. Moving gave him a second chance, helped him pull it together.</p><p>He wanted to leave the Valenzuela house; he was exhausted. But there was that bold press of men, converging on him, catching him up in their celebration. While he\u2019d been drowning in the past, Muriel St. Claire had arrived and was now gathered with the men. There was food to eat, gossip to pass around. He was eventually pushed out on the porch where cigars were clipped and lit. Rather than going with the women, Muriel stayed with the men, accepting her cigar and drink, making them chuckle. If they were a batch of women, the childbirth stories would start, but there were only a few such comments; Jack had delivered his own children, Preacher had almost fainted when Paige gave birth. Dr. John Stone joined them for a cigar, and talk went back to all the work left to be done to get Luke\u2019s cabins ready for the Sheridan and Valenzuela clans to hit town for the holidays.</p><p>Luke had no idea if he\u2019d been unusually quiet. He glanced at his watch and was stunned to see it was almost midnight\u2014that was a little scary. Hours had passed and he\u2019d been in the past, not real conscious of what had been going on around him. Then Shelby was beside him, looking up at him. \u201cShe\u2019s beautiful, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>He put an arm around her shoulders and laughed. \u201cShelby, babies are like puppies, there\u2019s no such thing as an ugly one.\u201d He put his cigar in the ash can. \u201cI\u2019m going to head home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not needed here anymore. Want some company?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He gave her shoulders a squeeze. That was exactly what he needed\u2014someone soft, warm and safe. This young woman had an uncanny ability to make everything in his life feel right. Good. \u201cYou bet I do,\u201d he said.</p><p>Fifteen</p><p>Jack Sheridan must have been more serious about needing room for his family than Luke realized. The day after Brie\u2019s childbirth, he showed up in the morning with Paul and six men in three pickups. It was the sound of the trucks arriving that brought Luke out of cabin two. As the men clambered out, he grinned. \u201cLooks like a barn raising.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight as well get it done. Show us what and where,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>First Luke showed them Art\u2019s cabin, which was finished. Luke was no decorator, but it had all new furnishings, appliances and fresh paint. Art had a new queen-size bed, a table with four chairs and a large chair with ottoman and reading lamp. There was a new stove and microwave, a small refrigerator that slipped under the kitchen counter. It boasted wooden blinds on the windows and a patterned area rug. Art was all stocked with dishes, glasses, sheets and towels; in the large bathroom were a small washer, dryer and closets. All the men walked through, poking around, nodding.</p><p>\u201cLuke, this came out real nice,\u201d Jack said. \u201cYou did a fine job here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no professional, but they\u2019ve come a long way since we bought \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>He showed them a partially finished cabin\u2014new baseboards, paint and appliances, but that was as far as he\u2019d gotten. Then he showed them an unfinished cabin. The appliances sat in the middle of the room, uninstalled. Blinds that he ordered were still in long boxes, ready to be hung after painting, area rugs were rolled against the wall and cans of paint were stacked next to a couple of folded tarps.</p><p>\u201cLooks simple enough,\u201d Paul remarked. \u201cTwo days. Maybe four, if we need extra supplies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour days?\u201d Luke repeated, stunned.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all moving and cosmetic. We\u2019re kind of fast.\u201d He grinned. \u201cWe do this a lot more than you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince there have only been one or two painters here, there are only the two tarps,\u201d Luke pointed out.</p><p>\u201cNot a problem, we came prepared, even brought some baseboards in case you didn\u2019t have enough. Now, if you\u2019re not worried we\u2019ll screw it up, this might be a good day for you to go over to Eureka and set up a pickup for that furniture and get anything else you might need for these cabins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave you working?\u201d he asked. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do that to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait till you see my family. And the Valenzuelas,\u201d Jack said. \u201cGo. Buy sheets and towels.\u201d</p><p>Luke thought about this for a very short time\u2014he had other important errands in Eureka. It was high time he plunged into an investigation of Art\u2019s job and group home there. He had to know the man\u2019s past in order to help with his future. Buying sheets, pillows, towels and dishes wouldn\u2019t take any time at all. \u201cYou sure? Can you keep an eye on Art in case he gets a little excited with all the people? Sometimes he\u2019s too much help, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, he\u2019ll be fine. Where is the good man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s not here, he\u2019s at the river.\u201d Luke grinned. \u201cI\u2019m not getting so much help since I bought him that rod and reel, but the freezer\u2019s full of fish. I have a feeling some of it\u2019s going to be coming your way at the bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe never turn down handouts,\u201d Jack said, hefting a ladder out of the truck.</p><p>As Luke stood and watched, they all started hauling tarps, ladders, toolboxes, brushes and rollers out of the truck beds. He wandered down to the river and found Art.</p><p>\u201cHey, Art,\u201d he said. \u201cHow are they biting today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, throwing out a line and slowly reeling it in. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJack and Paul and some men have come to work on the cabins.\u201d He laughed at the way Art\u2019s head jerked toward him and his eyes lit up. \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019d want you to help out if you feel like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they want me to?\u201d he asked, pulling in his line.</p><p>\u201cSure, but you\u2019ll have to let them tell you what they need the most help with. Huh?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, grinning happily.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to run over to Eureka to get some supplies. Need anything?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll get a lot done with Jack and Paul,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI bet you will. Come on, I\u2019ll walk back with you.\u201d</p><p>Art really enjoyed being around people, especially people who treated him with respect, and whenever there were men at work, he eagerly, though shyly, loved to pitch in. It sometimes made him a little clumsy.</p> <p>Luke only needed an hour or two in some big box stores to load up a couple of carts with things for the cabins. What he really wanted to do was visit a certain little grocery store. He had tried not to dwell on what Art had gone through, but he had managed to have a couple of conversations with him that gave him enough information to figure out where it was. Griffin\u2019s Grocery on Simmons Street.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a bad grocery store, if a little on the worn side. He glanced around and then grabbed a cart. It took him twenty seconds to pick out a bagger who had Down\u2019s and in the produce section there was a woman he asked a few questions and by her slow and difficult answers, grappling for the right word, he suspected some kind of disability. Then he noticed her name tag\u2014Netta. This was someone from the group home Art had said he missed. So Luke asked, \u201cWho\u2019s your manager here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh, uh-huh, Stan. That\u2019s Stan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where would I find Stan?\u201d Luke asked.</p><p>She shrugged and said, \u201cMaybe in the back?\u201d</p><p>Before Luke had a chance to search Stan out, there was a grocer beside him, asking, \u201cCan I help you with something, sir?\u201d</p> <p>Luke smiled his most engaging smile. \u201cI wanted to talk to the manager. This lady says that would be Stan.\u201d</p><p>This was a guy in his late thirties, sharp and clean, articulate, wearing a green apron. He returned the smile. \u201cI\u2019m the assistant manager. Anything I can do to help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot sure,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cI just bought a small store in Clear River. Just a little neighborhood store, smaller than this. Thing is\u2014I\u2019m doing it on a shoestring. It\u2019s a real good gamble, there\u2019s no grocery in there right now,\u201d he said, though he had absolutely no idea if there was a grocery store in Clear River. \u201cI\u2019m going to hire a couple of full-time people and a few part-time people. I\u2019m going to have to stay low budget for a while when it comes to payroll. I\u2019m interested in this store\u2019s employees. They\u2019re nice, they look productive, they\u2019re challenged. I wondered how you go about finding employees like them.\u201d</p><p>The man kept an even expression. \u201cYou\u2019re right, you\u2019re looking for Stan. That\u2019s his project. His sister has some kind of home and he gives work to a lot of them. But you might want to think twice about that idea. If they get slow or confused, it can be frustrating. I work real well with them, but...\u201d He shook his head almost sadly. \u201cIt bothers some people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy younger brother has Down\u2019s,\u201d Luke lied. \u201cI\u2019m up to speed on the problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have the patience for that, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cHe\u2019s got a real good job now. Makes him so happy to be managing his own life. The guy has never missed work, does his chores around the house, always has money in the bank... He\u2019s a dream come true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe work has to be uncomplicated to start\u2014like bagging. Opening boxes. Cleaning up. Even stocking shelves can get too complicated for some of them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEveryone has a different level of competence, but I understand what you\u2019re saying. So, where\u2019s Stan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFollow me,\u201d he said. And Luke followed.</p><p>The surprises started immediately. First of all, Stan was a young guy, probably not thirty. He was slight\u2014way smaller than Art\u2014but scrappy-looking. He met Luke with a curl to his lip and furrowed black brows, suspicious at once. There weren\u2019t a lot of reasons for a man to be suspicious right off unless he was expecting trouble. His size only confused Luke for a second; Stan was the one in charge and knowing Art, he would never hit back, never strike. Art also wouldn\u2019t lie. He knew right away\u2014Stan had punched Art.</p><p>Luke went through his spiel about the imaginary grocery store again, as convincingly as possible. He skipped the part about having a brother with Down\u2019s and concentrated on the hard work, minimum wage, reliable attendance, his need to stay low budget. Stan did a lot of head shaking and shrugging. \u201cI can\u2019t help you, buddy,\u201d he said. \u201cEureka is a long way from Clear River and these kids don\u2019t drive.\u201d</p><p>They aren\u2019t kids. But Luke kept a smile on his face. He offered to buy Stan a beer to talk a little bit about the grocery business, since they weren\u2019t competitors. Stan warmed up at the suggestion of a beer and he agreed\u2014it was time for a break. When they were leaving the grocery, Stan never told anyone where he was going and he glared at everyone. The employees here didn\u2019t seem happy, not even the good-natured assistant manager. To just peg Stan as an abusive jerk could be accurate, but it might be too simple. What Luke really wanted to know was what had happened to Art and why Stan hadn\u2019t reported him missing.</p><p>A glimmer of understanding came with a beer. \u201cMy sister has a group home for these retards. I help her out by giving her kids some work,\u201d he said. \u201cKeeps \u2019em busy and out of the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey ever give you trouble?\u201d Luke asked.</p><p>\u201cThey bug the shit outta me. How many times you gotta show \u2019em something? Tell \u2019em? But you\u2019re right about one thing\u2014they\u2019re cheap and they keep coming back. Maybe you could get someone in Clear River to start up a home. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s hard. Just has to be clean and pass inspection.\u201d</p><p>Luke had an instant image of someone completely unqualified to run such a home, doing it for the money, and it made him feel angry and ill. But he said, \u201cThat might be doable. I have an ex-wife whose always hurting for money....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an idea. Get the ex off your payroll.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I could talk to your sister? Think she\u2019d tell me how a person goes about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she wouldn\u2019t mind. What else has she got to do while all her kids are at work, huh?\u201d He gave an address and some directions, not far from the store. \u201cJust tell her I sent you over, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate it, man. You\u2019ll never know.\u201d</p><p>Luke dropped Stan at the store and immediately followed the directions he\u2019d been given. When he knocked on the door another surprise almost blew him over. Shirl was even younger than Stan. She was maybe twenty-eight at a stretch, dressed in a tight, short skirt, V-neck sweater that showed off her boobs, ultra-black hair with a pink strip framing her face. This was not Mother Teresa. And, of course, she was chewing gum. He could barely get a glimpse, but behind her appeared to be a very small, tidy house with old, worn furniture. That was the first time he considered that the couple of challenged employees he\u2019d seen in the grocery were wearing clean but well-worn clothes. Art had looked as if he\u2019d been homeless forever, but he was merely dirty and his clothes had already been threadbare. Shirl didn\u2019t waste a lot of cash clothing them.</p><p>She opened the door cautiously. \u201cHi,\u201d he said, pulling out his wallet and flipping it open fast, shut again just as fast, officially. \u201cI\u2019m looking for Art.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArt?\u201d she asked, stepping back. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cArt Cleary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm... I think he\u2019s at work...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been there. He\u2019s not at work,\u201d Luke said.</p><p>She frowned. \u201cAre you the guy with the new grocery store?\u201d she asked in confusion. \u201cMy brother called me and said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that was kind of a story.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m with the agency. Looking for Art. Just a follow-up visit, that\u2019s all. The paperwork on him shows it\u2019s been a while since he\u2019s had a visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d she said tiredly, holding up her hands, caught. \u201cWhat timing. He took off. Ah, it was just this morning. He said he was going to\u2014he wanted to go see some really old aunt of his in Redding. I called there, no answer, and no answering machine\u2014some of these people are real hicks. I was just about to call Social Services, but I\u2019m sure he just hitched a ride to his aunt\u2019s and she\u2019ll make sure he gets back. I was giving him a chance to check in\u2014I don\u2019t want him in trouble. What are you going to do, fine me?\u201d</p><p>Okay, lie number one, Luke thought. Art had been with Luke a couple of months. \u201cYou know what?\u201d Luke said. \u201cYou keep trying the aunt. The less said about this, the better for Art. The better for you, huh?\u201d And he winked at her.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She smiled. \u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you jot down that aunt\u2019s address and phone number for me? If I find him there, I can bring him back before there\u2019s any confusion about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have the address? She\u2019s next of kin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave me some time, huh?\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cTo tell the truth, I have a lot better things to do than track him down, but it\u2019s on my sheet.\u201d And Luke wondered how many challenged residents had run off or disappeared while Shirl and Stan pocketed the monthly stipend provided by social security or insurance or the state. What happened to their paychecks from the grocery store? Did Stan write them off and keep the money? \u201cI\u2019ll work it out,\u201d Luke said. \u201cThere might be paperwork. Don\u2019t worry about it. You\u2019re a nice girl to take him in the first place. These folks get to be a handful,\u201d he added with a grin.</p><p>\u201cTell me about it,\u201d she said.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know about the others, but there was no sweeter soul, nobody less trouble and more eager to please than Art. But he said, \u201cI\u2019ll take care of this and get back to you. You don\u2019t have to say anything.\u201d He raised his eyebrows. \u201cWe don\u2019t want him in trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she said. \u201cWanna come in? Have some coffee or...something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, but I\u2019m running behind. I\u2019ll come back though\u2014how\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Luke left Shirl and took a big truckload of supplies for the cabins back to Virgin River. He decided he wasn\u2019t going to take any chances\u2014he\u2019d get help from Mike and Brie. He\u2019d wait till after Christmas, give the Valenzuelas some time with their new baby and all the visiting family, then pay a visit, explain in detail about the group home and job Art had come from and ask what he had to do to clear things up so Art could stay with him. And if it wasn\u2019t possible for Art to stay with Luke, his next residence would be safer\u2014Luke would see to that. Between Mike and Brie, given their legal and law enforcement experience, they could at least help him figure out how he should proceed. And he\u2019d like to get Stan and Shirl investigated\u2014they were a couple of punk kids in charge of a lot of disabled adults. It smelled like they were working the system for profit.</p><p>Luke decided it would be necessary to go to Phoenix for a couple of days over Christmas. If he didn\u2019t, there was no telling how many Riordans might show up in Virgin River, and he didn\u2019t have the patience for that. Going to Phoenix would appease his mother and mollify his brothers.</p><p>With all that was going on over the holidays around his cabins, he needed to be sure everything was well organized, planned out. First of all, he had to be sure Jack and Mike Valenzuela could manage everything their families needed while Luke was away because Art certainly couldn\u2019t handle guests\u2019 needs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As for Art\u2014he\u2019d be fine on his own for a couple of days, but Luke didn\u2019t feel right leaving him alone. Luke appealed to Shelby and the general. Art should have a holiday dinner, a few presents that Luke would provide before leaving town and some sense of family. He knew before even asking they\u2019d be more than happy to welcome Art and see that he had a memorable Christmas.</p><p>And then there was Shelby. He racked his brain for a gift idea. He wanted her to know she was very important to him, but he was nervous about what to buy her. She was the kind of woman he felt like buying something flashy and sparkly for, but he just wasn\u2019t ready for something like that. Women saw things like jewelry as stepping stones to marriage, but things like sweaters sent the message you didn\u2019t care at all. So Luke went all out in the only way he knew how. It was more than he\u2019d spent on a woman in over a dozen years, including his mother\u2014he bought Shelby very special, six-hundred-dollar ostrich boots, handcrafted and stitched. He considered buying her a saddle, but the boots were more personal. They had their Christmas-gift exchange right before he left town, and when she opened her gift and saw the boots, she wept. No one had ever given her a gift like that in her life and he enjoyed success when she kissed all over him.</p><p>He took her into his arms, laughing sentimentally. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen you cry,\u201d he said, holding her close, rocking her back and forth gently.</p> <p>\u201cOh, you\u2019d have seen way too much of that a year ago....\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut these are happy tears. That\u2019s different. That means I did good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did very good,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re just amazing. Exactly what I would have had made for myself. Like my own skin. I could sleep in them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut someone could get hurt,\u201d he reminded her with a laugh.</p><p>She gave him a new leather jacket that was almost as expensive as the boots and just as personal. \u201cIt\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t wear it a lot. I know you love that flying jacket of yours and you\u2019re so sexy in it\u2014but this is for when you\u2019re not on the bike. For those rare times you dress up a little bit.\u201d</p> <p>He asked her about all those things she\u2019d talked about doing before Doc had died and she\u2019d become so busy helping Mel\u2014the applications to college, for example. She told him she\u2019d applied to several major California universities: Stanford, USC, UC Davis, San Francisco State. It was only Christmas\u2014September was a long way off. \u201cI also sent an application to Humboldt State University, right down the road, in case I decide to stay right where I am. They have a fabulous program for bachelor of science nursing.\u201d</p><p>That was his cue to say something about how much he\u2019d like that, he\u2019d like to keep her here forever. But something caught in his throat and he said, \u201cSounds like you\u2019ve covered all the possibilities, honey.\u201d</p><p>It was only the three boys in Phoenix for the Christmas holidays, Luke\u2019s stay being the most brief. \u201cWith Art and cabins full of holiday visitors, I can\u2019t be gone long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd with Shelby there,\u201d his mother said while she blended egg nog.</p><p>But Luke said nothing. His mother and Sean brought up Shelby\u2019s name fairly often, but Luke wasn\u2019t participating.</p><p>Their traditions amounted to food and church and laughter. There was a call from Colin in the Gulf, another from Paddy aboard ship. Once those two calls had been handled, they were free to leave the apartment. On Christmas Eve, they refused to let Maureen cook, even if it was the one thing she most wanted to do. Instead, the boys took her to Ruth\u2019s Chris Steak House in Scottsdale where you could eat the filets with a spoon. Then back to her apartment complex where they played pool in the recreation room, all four of them.</p> <p>Then there was midnight mass. This was where Maureen shined, presenting three of her five sons to her friends, to the priest, to the sisters she knew. \u201cI\u2019m going to hell,\u201d Luke muttered to Aiden. \u201cI took Communion and I haven\u2019t been in a church since last time I visited Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Aiden whispered.</p><p>\u201cMe, three,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>And the three of them cracked up, laughing so hard they could barely stand, while Maureen glared at them.</p><p>The tradition in their family since they\u2019d become adults was to open their presents after mass on Christmas Eve, but the presents were less important to the boys than the fact that now they could finally bring out the bottle and pour some healthy shots, since they were in for the night. They had purchased lavish gifts for their mother. Luke had gotten her a gift certificate to the Chanel counter at Dillard\u2019s. Aiden had bought an expensive Lladr\u00f3 sculpture for her collection. Sean gave her a new iPhone.</p><p>The brothers gave each other modest gifts. Luke got a subscription to a motorcycle magazine and a sweater that was as ugly as a ball of string. Sean gave Aiden a subscription to Penthouse magazine.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell,\u201d Aiden said, looking at the gift card. Aiden was thirty-four, an OB-GYN in the navy, a doctor responsible for active-duty military women and a lot of the wives of marines and sailors, although he himself was alone.</p><p>\u201cI thought you might like to know what women can look like when they don\u2019t have their feet in the stirrups.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThoughtful,\u201d Aiden said. \u201cHow can I ever thank you?\u201d</p><p>Luke simply gave his brothers shirts, but Maureen\u2019s gift to her three sons stole the show. \u201cIt\u2019s for the Camel-back Spa,\u201d she said proudly, passing them their individual envelopes. \u201cThey\u2019re open from eleven to three on Christmas Day and I made you appointments. I had to do it months ago. While I\u2019m making the turkey and trimmings, you can go have massages or facials, manicures.\u201d</p><p>They looked at each other with wide eyes. And each one said, \u201cThank you, Mom, that\u2019s wonderful,\u201d \u201cThat should be cool, Mom, thanks,\u201d \u201cHow original, Mom\u2014thanks a million.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, I know you think you\u2019re too manly for facials, but try it. You\u2019ll love it!\u201d</p><p>And on Christmas Day, while Maureen was making the turkey, Aiden, Luke and Sean found a bar that was open and drowned their guilt that they were not in a spa having facials and manicures. When they got back to Maureen\u2019s apartment, she fussed over how relaxed they all looked.</p><p>The Christmas dinner was, as usual, fabulous. Maureen loved nothing so much as fussing over her family and they all ate too much, which pleased her. Luke would be the first to leave, the next morning. Home to Virgin River. As his last day with his mother and brothers wore on, he grew more and more pensive, thinking about how Shelby had said after the first of the year, she\u2019d be moving on. When everyone finally went to bed, he fixed himself a drink and sat up in the dimly lit living room of his mother\u2019s apartment.</p><p>Aiden found him there, sitting in the semidark, nursing a whiskey. Aiden fixed himself a matching drink and went into the living room, sitting down across from him. He was one of the brothers who\u2019d tried marriage. It had been brief, during his residency, but in his case the breakup was his idea and he couldn\u2019t get out of his mess fast enough. He didn\u2019t suffer anything afterward but relief.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Aiden said. \u201cWe could talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk about what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy you look like someone shot your dog. Shelby, I assume.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d Luke said, taking a drink. \u201cThat\u2019s not serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that has nothing to do with your sleeplessness or your mood then. Trouble with the cabins? The town? Your tenant/helper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAiden, there\u2019s nothing bothering me, except maybe that I\u2019ve been working my ass off for three months getting a house and six cabins rebuilt and furnished.\u201d</p><p>Aiden took a sip of his drink. \u201cTwenty-five, so Sean and Mom say. And gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean\u2019s an idiot who can\u2019t mind his own business. She\u2019s just a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just a girl who has you looking a little uptight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said, standing. \u201cYou don\u2019t look that great yourself\u2014I\u2019m going to bed.\u201d He threw back the rest of his drink.</p><p>\u201cNah, don\u2019t,\u201d Aiden said. \u201cFix another one. Give me ten minutes, huh? I can just ask a couple of questions, right? I\u2019m not like Sean, I\u2019m not going to get up your ass about this. But you haven\u2019t talked about it much and I\u2019m a little curious.\u201d</p><p>Luke thought about that for a second and against his better judgment, he went into the kitchen and poured himself a short shot. He went back and sat down, leaning his elbows on his knees. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asked abruptly.</p><p>Aiden chuckled. \u201cOkay. Relax. Just a girl? Not serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. A town girl, sort of. She\u2019s visiting her family and she\u2019ll be leaving pretty soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh\u2014I didn\u2019t know that. I guess I thought she lived there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong visit,\u201d Luke said. \u201cHer mother died last spring. She\u2019s spending a few months with her uncle until she gets on with things\u2014like where she wants to live. College and travel and stuff. This is temporary, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014if you felt serious, there isn\u2019t any reason you wouldn\u2019t let it...you know...evolve...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel serious,\u201d he said, his mouth in a firm line.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I get that. Does she? Feel serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has plans. I didn\u2019t trap her, Aiden. I made sure she knew\u2014I\u2019m not interested in being a family man. I told her she could do better, I\u2019m just not built that way. But when I\u2019m with a woman, I know how to treat her right. If she needed something permanent, she was in the wrong place. That\u2019s how it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, never? No one in this family is interested in that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit. I am. Sean says he\u2019s having too much fun, but the truth is he has the attention span of a cabbage. But me? I\u2019d like a wife, a family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you already try that once?\u201d Luke asked, sitting back in his chair, relaxing a little bit since the attention had shifted to Aiden\u2019s life.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah\u2014I tried hard. Next time I try, I\u2019m going to see if I can find a woman who\u2019s not certifiable and off her meds.\u201d He grinned. \u201cReally, that\u2019s what happens when you ignore all the symptoms because she\u2019s such a friggin\u2019 miracle in bed, it causes brain damage.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m on the lookout for that.\u201d</p><p>Luke grinned. \u201cShe was hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was worse than nuts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNightmare nuts,\u201d Aiden agreed. \u201cBut this gorgeous twenty-five-year-old\u2014she\u2019s real sweet, I hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFucking Sean...\u201d Luke said, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cNot Sean. Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost as bad,\u201d Luke said. \u201cYou know Mom\u2014she\u2019s been on this marriage-and-grandchildren campaign for a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, she\u2019s not sweet?\u201d Aiden asked.</p><p>\u201cSweeter than honey,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut there are other things about her\u2014complications. Her mother had ALS and Shelby was her nurse for years till she died\u2014the girl\u2019s had no life. She dropped out of school and hardly left the house. Her idea of a big night was reading to her mother or watching a DVD with her. She\u2019s had her freedom for about six months and it was a hard freedom\u2014that\u2019s why she\u2019s with her uncle, recovering. Making a transition. To hear her tell it, it\u2019s not easy to go from being needed twenty-four hours a day to having no one to take care of but yourself. She\u2019s a young twenty-five, as in, not a lot of life experience. She\u2019s a little bit like a prisoner on parole.\u201d</p><p>Aiden\u2019s mouth was open slightly. \u201cJesus.\u201d He took a breath. \u201cMom knows this?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSure she does. They talked a lot, which wasn\u2019t a great idea. Mom loves her. She\u2019d like nothing better than to reel her in.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cBad idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa, sounds like she had a rough time. How\u2019s she doing? With the transition?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cGood, I think. You\u2019d never know it\u2014that she\u2019s been through all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was the problem? Not enough money to put the mother in long-term care?\u201d</p> <p>Luke was shaking his head. \u201cPlenty of money\u2014her uncle wanted to put the mother in a nursing home. But Shelby wouldn\u2019t have it. She was committed. She says her mother was her best friend.\u201d</p><p>Aiden was quiet for a long moment. Finally he said, \u201cThis sounds like an incredible young woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is that. Very mild mannered\u2014hard to guess she could have that kind of conviction. Stubbornness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrength,\u201d Aiden added. \u201cCommitment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019d have to be strong to do that, right? Yeah, she\u2019s very strong, but she seems fragile.\u201d Then he grinned. \u201cUnless you see her on a horse. She\u2019s a hundred and ten pounds, and on a horse, she\u2019s Annie Oakley.\u201d</p> <p>Again Aiden was quiet for a moment, sipping. \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cDo?\u201d Luke repeated. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe needs to get on with her life. She\u2019s behind. You can relate\u2014I can relate. Remember being set free from medical school after years of no life? What did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarried a nut job,\u201d he said, smiling blandly.</p><p>\u201cShelby put in her time, did the right thing, took good care of her mom, and now it\u2019s her turn. She\u2019s going to go back to school. She says she\u2019s going to be a nurse, but you watch\u2014she\u2019ll end up a doctor or something. She\u2019s quiet, but scary smart. She has money from selling a paid-off house\u2014so she can travel all over the world, pay for a dozen years of college. You know how important that is, we\u2019ve been all over the world and it\u2019s worth seeing.\u201d</p> <p>Aiden laughed. \u201cI hope she sees better parts than we did. You saw a bunch of deserts, I went to sea, medical officer on a ship...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it all counts. Life experience\u2014it\u2019s worth it. She\u2019s young\u2014she has time to look around. I\u2019ll tell you what\u2014that girl\u2019s going to have men hunting her down, she\u2019s that good-looking. She never had that before. In high school she was shy, had a couple of short-term boyfriends, but she lost a lot of shyness, got tougher and more aggressive while she was taking care of her mom and had to go up against doctors and therapists and hospitals and insurance companies.\u201d His eyes glistened proudly. \u201cBelieve me, she\u2019s ready now. It\u2019s her time.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s letting her go, Aiden thought. For her, though it\u2019s going to kill him. Aiden leaned back in his chair and sipped his drink. \u201cWhat if she just decides to stay? At her uncle\u2019s place? Forever?\u201d</p><p>Luke laughed. \u201cShe\u2019s not going to, that would be a waste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I admit it\u2014I got a little comfortable. The whole chase is a little boring and it wasn\u2019t exactly a punishment to have a sweet, pretty girl right there, handy. But that\u2019s just convenience, I\u2019m winding down a little. There\u2019s this nice little bar in Virgin River\u2014bunch of townpeople go there at the end of the day\u2014real good people. They have the best food on the planet and the jukebox hasn\u2019t been turned on once since I hit town. A couple of marines run the place, so we connected. It spoiled me for entertainment, I lost interest in noisy, smoky bars with slutty girls looking for a pickup. I\u2019ve been thinking... If I can rent out those cabins...work and live there, grab a beer at Jack\u2019s, hunt and fish...I\u2019m telling you\u2014it\u2019s almost a perfect life. You\u2019ll have to come up sometime.\u201d</p><p>Aiden let him think about that for a minute. Then he said, \u201cHow old do you have to be to appreciate that as a perfect life?\u201d</p><p>Luke laughed. \u201cAbout thirty-eight, twenty years of army, four wars. But now I\u2019m thinking about staying in one place a while. I might look around for some flying in the area, something like medical-airlift transport or something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCould someone like me get into that? Small town like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have a midwife and everyone loves her.\u201d Luke laughed. \u201cYou\u2019d have some stiff competition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I mean is, could someone younger than thirty-eight want that life? Or do you have to be this crusty, beat-up old grunt?\u201d</p><p>Luke got the point and his lips went back into that firm, nonnegotiable line.</p><p>\u201cDo you suppose young women ever choose that life over Ph.D.s or world travel? Think that\u2019s ever happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think young women like Shelby might think they want that life and two years later realize they threw away their real life and they\u2019re stuck, and everything would go to hell at that point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s a guess,\u201d Aiden said. \u201cAnd this is a remarkable, committed, stubborn, aggressive woman who\u2019s been up against a lot and knows what she wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tricked me,\u201d Luke said. \u201cYou said you were going to be a little curious but now you\u2019re up my ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are the odds you\u2019re ever going to run into someone like her again, once she leaves Virgin River? If you let her get away?\u201d</p><p>Luke stood up. He put his drink, what was left of it, on a coaster. \u201cBut that\u2019s not the point,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to bed.\u201d</p><p>Late on Christmas Day, Shelby leaned on the corral fence and watched as her cousin Tom kept an eye on Art astride Chico. Ever since first seeing Chico, Art had wanted to ride him, but Chico was a lot of horse for Art. Tom, however, was more than happy to spot that. And when they were done, Shelby would take Art back to his cabin and Tom would go into town and find his girl.</p><p>She jumped when she felt a hand on her shoulder. With the noise of churning hooves in the corral, she hadn\u2019t heard Vanni\u2019s approach. Shelby turned toward Vanni and then turned back, giving her cheeks a quick wipe.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Vanni said. \u201cYou can\u2019t pretend. Something happened between you and Luke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Really, nothing.\u201d</p><p>Vanni turned her around. \u201cSomething,\u201d she insisted. \u201cDid you have a fight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, nothing like that. It\u2019s just that...\u201d Her voice trailed away.</p><p>\u201cWhat, honey? What happened?\u201d</p><p>Shelby\u2019s eyes welled anew and she shrugged. \u201cOh, well. I miss him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a couple of days, honey. That\u2019s all...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She sniffed. \u201cIt would have meant the world to me if he\u2019d called to wish me a merry Christmas. But I haven\u2019t heard a word out of him. He loves me like I mean everything to him, but he never says the words. I don\u2019t know why. Why, Vanni?\u201d</p><p>Vanni ran a gentle finger along her cheek, wiping off a tear. \u201cBaby, I don\u2019t know Luke like you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost as though he tries to keep this distance between us...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you wouldn\u2019t cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. I said if he made me cry, I\u2019d get over it. I still don\u2019t have any regrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt hurts, huh?\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cI guess I\u2019m as naive as everyone thought. I fell in love with him. I didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, baby,\u201d Vanni said, pulling her into her arms.</p><p>Shelby put her head on Vanni\u2019s shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be real hard to give him up.\u201d Then she let out a little huff of rueful laughter. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be real hard if he lets me go. But...I\u2019ll get over it. What are my choices? I couldn\u2019t have done anything differently.\u201d</p><p>The day after Christmas, while Walt was babysitting so Vanni could spend some time working on the wallpaper at her new house, Shelby drove over to the new neighbor\u2019s place. She banged on Muriel\u2019s front door and heard the sound of welcoming dogs inside. Muriel beamed when she pulled the door open.</p><p>\u201cAny chance you have a cup of coffee?\u201d Shelby asked.</p><p>\u201cSure. Come in. Everything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, not exactly. Thing is, I need to talk to someone who\u2019s not a member of my family. About Luke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGosh,\u201d Muriel said. \u201cI\u2019m honored. I would\u2019ve expected you to go to Mel. The two of you are awful close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. But she\u2019s got a lot of family in town right now,\u201d Shelby said. \u201cAnd I just thought, maybe...I don\u2019t know, Muriel. Maybe you can tell me something I don\u2019t already know. About...you know...men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do realize I\u2019ve been married five times and never could make it work,\u201d Muriel said on her way to the kitchen. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my fault, I swear it, but still...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think maybe I\u2019ve been a fool,\u201d Shelby said.</p><p>\u201cOh, now, that I\u2019ve been a hundred times. I am an expert.\u201d Muriel laughed, pouring Shelby a cup of coffee. \u201cJust tell me what\u2019s going on. I won\u2019t breathe a word to anyone. Especially Walt.\u201d</p><p>Shelby ran it down quickly. She met him, fell for him, bought into that whole never-settling-down program because she had big plans of her own and she didn\u2019t regret it. Now she wanted more, but he was still in that same place, while she was suffering. \u201cWhen he said he\u2019d never put down roots and didn\u2019t want that whole marriage-and-family deal, I really thought that meshed pretty well with what I was looking for. At the time, anyway. He never once lied to me, Muriel. He didn\u2019t lead me on and he\u2019s always treated me like pure gold. Maybe I was the one who lied to him\u2014I thought that worked for me. But things changed. I still want to travel, go to school, but I also want the whole deal\u2014a partner, a family, the security of a relationship I can trust. I don\u2019t want to be with a man who\u2019s just going to dump me right about the time I think I can\u2019t live without him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, little darling,\u201d Muriel said. \u201cI wanted all those things, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. It didn\u2019t work out for me. I hope it works out for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve had such an amazing career!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was real lucky that way,\u201d she said. She reached across her kitchen table and grabbed both Shelby\u2019s hands. \u201cI have some bad news, my sweet girl. One\u2014you can\u2019t change people. If he doesn\u2019t change himself, you\u2019re flat out of luck. And two\u2014you want what you want. Need what you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI keep looking for a compromise...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShelby, there are many compromises in relationships. You learn to live with men\u2019s underwear on the floor just shy of the hamper, toothpaste spit on the mirror, and you learn to keep your mouth shut while he drives around in circles for hours because he won\u2019t ask for directions. But the things you feel in the marrow of your bones, the deep and meaningful desires that will make your life complete\u2014there\u2019s no compromise in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>Muriel shook her head. \u201cYou can force yourself to go along. You might even find a way to force him to go along. But there\u2019s bitterness in it. It\u2019s not worth it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you didn\u2019t go along,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you have any regrets? About being alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not alone, Shelby,\u201d she said patiently. \u201cI\u2019m on my own\u2014there\u2019s a difference. And I have the most wonderful family of friends. It is so much better than having a man I\u2019m not compatible with, even if I thought I adored him. Believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Shelby said. \u201cI so love the way you see things....\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Muriel laughed. \u201cI\u2019ve had so much practice at seeing things. Far more than I\u2019m happy about.\u201d</p><p>They talked through a whole pot of coffee, about Shelby\u2019s life, about Muriel\u2019s. It surprised Shelby to have anything at all in common with this Hollywood icon. After a couple of hours, Shelby asked, \u201cWhat am I to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019ll know what to do. Don\u2019t be hasty, sweetheart. But don\u2019t wait too long. There will be a moment of clarity, my little darling, and it will come to you that it\u2019s time to take care of yourself. You don\u2019t have to give up your dreams, Shelby. Never take scraps. Never.\u201d</p> <p>Sixteen</p><p>Right after Cameron Michaels had a nice holiday in Portland with his parents, brother and sister and their families, he drove to Virgin River, towing a U-Haul with his books, computer, bedroom furniture, clothes, TV and stereo equipment. He\u2019d traded his Porsche in for a Suburban with all-wheel drive for getting around the mountains, valleys and foothills. When he pulled up in front of Doc\u2019s house, Mel came out onto the porch immediately, all smiles. \u201cWelcome, Doctor,\u201d she said.</p><p>Shelby stepped out of the clinic right behind her. \u201cHey, Cameron,\u201d she said. \u201cHow was the drive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot bad,\u201d he said. \u201cAt least the sun\u2019s out here. It\u2019s wet and ugly in Portland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave the trailer and everything,\u201d Mel said. \u201cI\u2019m going to grab the baby and walk over to Jack\u2019s. Then the guys will help you unload. You\u2019re going to stay with us at the house tonight, until we can get your bedroom set up.\u201d</p> <p>Shelby turned and went back into the clinic.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to impose,\u201d he said.</p><p>Mel laughed. \u201cLet me get this right. You\u2019re coming to work in my town for a pittance and you don\u2019t want to impose? You\u2019ll stay with us at least tonight, longer if necessary.\u201d</p><p>Shelby was back with little Emma cuddled against her, Mel\u2019s coat draped over her arm and the clinic keys in her hand, which she used to lock the door.</p><p>Mel put on the coat and took the baby from Shelby.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the little guy?\u201d Cameron asked.</p> <p>\u201cWith his dad, serving. He\u2019s in the backpack. So\u2014you settled up all your affairs without difficulty?\u201d Mel asked.</p><p>\u201cSlick as grease. Had an offer on the house in three days, sold most of the furniture and put some favorite things in storage up there, traded in the sports car for an all-wheel-drive vehicle and had Christmas with my family.\u201d</p><p>They began walking across the street to the bar. \u201cWhat did they think of this idea?\u201d Shelby asked him.</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cThey think I\u2019ve completely lost my mind. And maybe I have. But what the hell, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really can\u2019t figure out why you did this,\u201d Mel said.</p><p>\u201cSame reason you did, Mel,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNah, couldn\u2019t be. My heart was in pieces. I had to go someplace simple and quiet to get a handle on my life. To heal. To be alone and not so obviously alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame reason as you, Mel,\u201d he repeated.</p> <p>She stopped walking. \u201cHo boy,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s more to this story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019ll get sloppy some night and compare our broken hearts. How\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>She tugged at his sleeve. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t have anything to do with any of our, ah, mutual friends, does it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Mel. This has nothing to do with Vanessa.\u201d Shelby\u2019s eyes grew very round and Cameron looked at her. \u201cBefore Paul got smart and told Vanni how much he loved her, I had a couple of dates with her. That\u2019s all\u2014a couple of dates. She disappointed me when she picked the other guy\u2014but she didn\u2019t break my heart. No worries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShew,\u201d Mel said. \u201cHad me worried there for a second. I mean, the gossip in this town is good, but it shouldn\u2019t be that good!\u201d</p><p>Cameron laughed. \u201cThis is going to be great. I\u2019m going to learn to fly-fish on my days off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have plenty of those,\u201d she said, stepping up on the bar\u2019s porch.</p><p>Cameron apparently didn\u2019t think there was anything odd about the number of cars and trucks at the bar and on the street, but then he wasn\u2019t up on the seasonal activities. From January to June things were usually pretty wet and quiet around Virgin River, hunting done and the fishing pretty much closed. But when he walked into the bar, a bar stuffed with people, a cheer and greeting erupted. He stood just inside the door, stunned, while the din slowly subsided. Jack came around the bar, little David squirming around in the backpack. \u201cCome on in, Doc. Welcome.\u201d</p><p>Next came Paul, his hand outstretched, then Vanni with a hug and kiss on the cheek, and Walt, pulling him into a hearty embrace. Preacher just about broke his ribs with his hug, then there was Paige, Mike and Brie with a brand-new baby. Next came introductions to friends and neighbors from all over town and the outlying ranches. A cold draft was pressed into his hand, there was a hearty and delicious buffet set out and lots of handshakes, grateful pats on the back. Among the crowd were doctors June Hudson and John Stone and their families, offering services and assistance at the call. June\u2019s dad, Doc Hudson, offered to come out to Virgin River for a while and visit with him on the subject of country doctoring and maybe a trip out to the river. \u201cWe can get your angling up to speed before the real fishing starts,\u201d he offered.</p><p>Cameron ate, drank, got to know the people from town and felt, for the first time in a very long time, a part of something personal and important. Something both hearty and delicate. There were very few single people among this happy throng, but it didn\u2019t affect him in the way being out with his married partners had depressed him, made him feel like he didn\u2019t belong anywhere. Here, he felt like one of them, though he was absent a partner with whom to share it all.</p><p>At some point in the early evening, Mel told him Jack would bring him home and she\u2019d see him later. Jack helped settle his family in the Hummer so Mel could take the babies home to bed. Little by little people bid good-night and wandered off and then at nine o\u2019clock the bar seemed to empty of patrons, bidding him good-night and expressing, again, their grateful thanks and earnest welcome. And then it was down to Jack, Preacher and Cam.</p><p>Jack got down a couple of glasses. \u201cWe usually pour a shot at the end of the day, after the bar clears out. I\u2019ll drive you out to the house if you\u2019re up to one more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cJack, this was great, what you did.\u201d</p><p>Jack tipped a bottle of good, aged Glenlivet over three glasses. \u201cI didn\u2019t do it, Doc. These things happen when word gets out. It\u2019s a real spontaneous place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, they\u2019re wonderful,\u201d Cam said.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t have much money, they\u2019re not real sophisticated, they haven\u2019t read the classics\u2014most of them haven\u2019t, anyway\u2014but this place has heart. It\u2019s a simple thing, really. They can\u2019t feed your pocketbook too much, but they know the value of friendship and gratitude. You\u2019ll never get hungry or lonely. That\u2019s what the town gets by on. You\u2019ll like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never felt unappreciated in my work, but this is something new.\u201d He lifted a glass toward Preacher and Jack. \u201cTo new beginnings,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cTo satisfaction,\u201d Jack added.</p><p>Cameron drank to it. \u201cI\u2019m really glad I did this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad to be a big risk, Doc,\u201d Preacher observed.</p><p>\u201cWas it for you?\u201d Cameron asked him.</p><p>\u201cNaw,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cOnce I got up here and saw what Jack had set up, it was a no-brainer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cThank you for giving me the chance,\u201d he added.</p><p>Luke had drawn Shelby away from the party welcoming Cameron Michaels just after the crowd had begun to disperse. Luke took Art in his car and Shelby followed him out to the house and cabins in her Jeep. Once there, she went first to Art\u2019s cabin to make sure he was all settled.</p><p>\u201cDoing okay, Art?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing very good,\u201d he said, grinning.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d check on you before turning in for the night. Sleep tight, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let the bedbugs bite,\u201d he said, echoing something she often said to him.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI won\u2019t. Don\u2019t forget your prayers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t ever,\u201d he promised.</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t forget to brush and floss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t ever,\u201d he said.</p><p>Then she went up on Luke\u2019s front porch, where he was waiting for her, grinning. \u201cI thought I saved his ass, but it\u2019s you he worships.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s quite as serious as that,\u201d she said, letting him enfold her in his embrace. \u201cEventually you should talk to someone about him. Let his people know where he is, maybe have him evaluated. I\u2019m sure they won\u2019t have any problem with him being here, as long as he\u2019s safe and healthy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I got a start on that. I found out where he\u2019s from\u2014not a good place. I\u2019ll talk to Mike and Brie about how to get him out of there,\u201d he said, kissing her.</p><p>She pulled away. \u201cAnd keep him?\u201d</p><p>Luke shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to adopt him. I\u2019ll give him a place to stay and he\u2019ll do chores. But he shouldn\u2019t have to do chores for someone who hits him.\u201d He kissed her again and then he pulled her into the cabin.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ll be responsible for him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShelby, it\u2019s not exactly a strain on me. He doesn\u2019t need much watching, just a safe place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when you sell the cabins and leave here?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIf that happens, it shouldn\u2019t be any trouble to find him a good place. One I\u2019m sure isn\u2019t some Social Services scam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut aren\u2019t you worried that will hurt him? Confuse him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know how sensitive he is\u2014I\u2019ll treat that carefully. But I think maybe I\u2019ll put off worry until it\u2019s necessary.\u201d</p><p>Shelby had known him a few months, a couple of months she\u2019d known him intimately, and for her it had been thrilling. The way they came together was so amazing to her; just thinking about him filled her with shivering anticipation. She had no regrets about waiting so long to find out what this was about because she was certain it could never have been like this with any other man.</p><p>To her it was a miracle. Fate, putting her with the one man perfect for her. When he touched her, she believed he felt the same way. But he gave no other sign.</p><p>After the lovemaking, he held her close to him. He could never stop kissing her, touching her, stroking her. It mystified her that he could be like this\u2014so tender, so involved in her, so loving\u2014and yet not in love at all. She wondered how he did that. She thought if she understood it, maybe she could walk away without being torn to pieces over him.</p><p>She rolled over and wriggled on top of him, lying prone, lifted up, braced on his chest, looking into his eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s a new doctor in town and Mel won\u2019t need me so much anymore. I\u2019ve been here since August. There\u2019s less and less on my schedule every day.\u201d</p><p>He ran a big hand down her spine, over her smooth bottom. He gave her a lusty squeeze. \u201cI\u2019ll keep you busy some of that time,\u201d he said with a laugh.</p><p>She gazed down into his eyes, so filled up with love for him. How could he not know? She wouldn\u2019t tell him she loved him first. She couldn\u2019t ask him; her pride wouldn\u2019t allow it. But she wasn\u2019t too proud to give him a chance. \u201cAll my applications to nursing programs have been sent out\u2014now I\u2019m just waiting to hear. And remember, I even shot one in to Humboldt State U, in case you come to your senses and decide you can\u2019t live without me. They have an excellent program.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He pushed her hair back over her shoulder. \u201cI bet there are lots of excellent programs out there, aren\u2019t there?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and tried to send him a mental message. Say it, she thought. Tell me you love me; tell me you wish I could stay right here. With you. \u201cAnd the one right here is as good as any of them.\u201d</p><p>Instead of talking, he tightened his arms around her and rolled with her until she was beneath him. Then he covered her mouth in a deep, hot kiss. And his hands began to move in long, slow, thrilling caresses, his fingers gently probing her again.</p> <p>With a sigh of disappointment, she yielded to him, filling up on sensation, knowing in her heart this might be all she ever had of him.</p><p>Abby had called Vanessa from her parents\u2019 house in Seattle on New Year\u2019s Day. \u201cWhat are the chances you\u2019re up for a little visit?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d Vanessa said. \u201cYour timing is great! We just moved into our new house before Christmas and there\u2019s still lots of stuff to do around here. Between trips to the coast to shop and putting things right around here, you can help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to help,\u201d Abby said. \u201cHow soon can I come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as you like,\u201d Vanni said.</p> <p>\u201cThen get the sheets on the guest bed, I\u2019ll be on my way in a few days.\u201d</p><p>On her travel day, Abby kissed her parents goodbye in the driveway at dawn and headed south. The second she got into the car, her tummy muscles relaxed and she felt herself expand into the pants with the elastic waistband. She had a cooler packed with food and drinks and only stopped for gas and more potty breaks than seemed fair. By early evening, she was driving past the general\u2019s house, around the curve past the stable and down the road to a brand-new house. She gave her horn a toot and got out of the car. Vanessa came out to greet her, her smile bright and happy. As Abby walked toward Vanni, the latter stopped suddenly, eyes wide. Abby hadn\u2019t put her coat on and stood before her friend, running a smooth hand over a very slightly rounded belly.</p><p>Vanni recovered herself and wrapped Abby in her embrace. \u201cYou didn\u2019t say you were bringing company,\u201d she said with a soft smile.</p><p>\u201cVanni, I\u2019m in a terrible mess,\u201d Abby said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better come in, honey. I get the sense you want to talk about some things.\u201d</p><p>Vanni had something that smelled delicious in the oven, Matt was crawling around the living-room floor and pulling himself up on the furniture, and Paul, Abby learned, was not yet home, very likely having stopped off at the bar in town for a beer with his friends.</p> <p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d Vanni asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty embarrassed for one thing,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m in some trouble, for another. The only people who know about the pregnancy are my parents and my doctor. And now you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019d do anything to help you, but not talking about it isn\u2019t going to work much longer.\u201d</p><p>Abby shook her head. \u201cAt Nikki and Joe\u2019s wedding, you all knew divorce was in the wind. I couldn\u2019t stand to talk about it\u2014but the marriage to Ross was long over by that time. If you keep up with any tabloid news, you know he had been living with another woman for more than six months by the time our divorce was final.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, honey\u2014I just don\u2019t see any tabloids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I should have dispensed with that divorce immediately. The day he asked me, I should have signed the papers.\u201d She laughed suddenly. \u201cDid I say he asked me? His lawyer asked me. A threatening and hostile man, he called weekly. I let the machine pick it up. I haven\u2019t heard from Ross in forever. More than a year by now. Don\u2019t ask me why I waited\u2014I didn\u2019t want him back in my life. I think I was just stunned senseless and couldn\u2019t move. Plus, I felt like such a fool for marrying him in the first place, thinking I knew him when clearly I didn\u2019t. It just ripped me up. As soon as I got back to Los Angeles after the wedding, I signed. A little over a month later, I was a free woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re better off,\u201d Vanni said.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure of it. Did you know that I met him while he was in recovery from drug addiction? For a little while, he was wonderful. Sweet and charming and going to meetings every day. By the time we\u2019d been married six weeks, he was back on tour, using again. But I screwed up, Vanni. I signed a prenuptial agreement. A very simple and uncomplicated one\u2014if I remained faithful during our marriage, in the event of divorce I could collect alimony. There was no reason for a promise like that to make me nervous.</p> <p>\u201cBut\u2014his lawyer presented me with bills. Credit cards\u2014credit cards that I didn\u2019t even have! I immediately owed thousands of dollars, tens of thousands. I needed that alimony. To pay my share of his bills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God, the turd! Of course you did,\u201d Vanni said. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t feel guilty about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d she said. She smoothed her hands over her belly. \u201cThis happened right before I signed the papers, before the divorce was final. It\u2019s irrelevant that he was already living with another woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the father?\u201d Vanni asked as delicately as she could.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not able to talk about that, Vanni. I\u2019m sorry. It was, in fact, a one-night stand with a complete stranger. A completely lovely, tender stranger. If I wasn\u2019t pregnant, I\u2019d get in touch with him, get to know him better. I could take my time figuring out if he\u2019s really a lovely man\u2014months and months longer than I gave Ross. But now it\u2019s too big a risk,\u201d she said. \u201cHe would know he\u2019s the father. And what if he\u2019s not as wonderful as he seemed? Vanni, I don\u2019t really know anything about him except that he was nice to me for one night. Jeez, Ross was nice to me for longer than that and look at what he turned out to be. I just can\u2019t take the chance. I can\u2019t subject the babies to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBabies?\u201d Vanni asked.</p><p>Abby looked down. \u201cI just found out. Twins,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHoly cow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so big already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo\u2014what\u2019s your plan?\u201d Vanni asked.</p><p>\u201cI have to hide out somewhere until the babies are at least a few months old. I figure after they\u2019re here, no one on Ross\u2019s legal team can prove I defied the prenup and ask me for the alimony back\u2014but if anyone representing him discovers I\u2019m pregnant, they might be able to subpoena tests to determine when I conceived. It was a little more than a month before the divorce was final\u2014I\u2019m scared to death that can be proven. Vanni, I can\u2019t pay those bills I\u2019m stuck with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you asked anyone? Like your OB?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s possible to determine the date of conception from prenatal records. I need to disppear until those bills are paid and I stop accepting the alimony, until the babies are older and Ross\u2019s lawyers lose interest...</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she went on, \u201cI took a year\u2019s unpaid leave from the airline and I\u2019ll look around here for something to rent. My change of address is to my mom\u2019s in Seattle and she\u2019ll collect my mail and send it to me. I put my mom on my account in Seattle, and to keep the trail cold, she\u2019ll wire me cash for my living expenses. Just six more months. Or so.\u201d She got tears in her eyes. \u201cVanni, I don\u2019t want his money. But I don\u2019t have any other way to pay those bills, to live.\u201d</p><p>Vanni reached out and put her hand over Abby\u2019s. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare feel guilty about that! Good God, Abby\u2014he cheated on you, lied to you, used drugs...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I got pregnant.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cExcept for that money I need to cover his bills, I\u2019m going to find a way to give it back to him. Eventually. I don\u2019t want his money. It\u2019s like it\u2019s stained. I just have to get beyond this. Then...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not renting something! You\u2019re going to stay right here with us!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I can\u2019t do that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not staying alone, pregnant with twins! I won\u2019t allow it! Paul won\u2019t allow it! We\u2019re going to get you through this, help you regroup. We have a wonderful nurse midwife\u2014Mel. You met her at Nikki and Joe\u2019s wedding. But there\u2019s also a fantastic OB right down the road in Grace Valley. And recently, a new pediatrician in town. An old friend, actually. So you see, everything is going to work out.\u201d</p><p>Abby\u2019s face melted into tears and she leaned into her hands, sobbing. Vanni immediately enfolded her in loving arms. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she whispered. \u201cNo crying! We\u2019re having babies! Wonderful little babies.\u201d Matt crawled over to Abby, pulled himself up on her knees and began to pat her thigh, babbling. \u201cThat\u2019s right\u2014we never cry about babies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God, Vanni. I didn\u2019t know what I was going to do. I not only shouldn\u2019t be having one\u2014there\u2019s no way I should be having two! And God help me, I want them! I want them so much!\u201d</p><p>Abby settled in with Vanni and Paul and got comfortable, feeling safe for the first time in weeks. She wasn\u2019t quite ready to be introduced to the town. When they made their occasional trip into Virgin River to have dinner at Jack\u2019s, she declined. She was still feeling embarrassed and shy about presenting herself as a single mother even though in this day and age it was hardly a rarity.</p><p>Later in January she was due a prenatal exam and made an appointment with Mel Sheridan. It was time to consider her delivery options and resume her prenatal care, which she would pay for in cash.</p><p>When she had her appointment with Mel, she was as captivated as Vanni promised her she would be. And the professional way in which Mel handled her was refreshing. \u201cSingle mom, huh? That\u2019s got it\u2019s challenges, but you\u2019re a lucky woman. Twins, good friends, perfect health, I can\u2019t think what else you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty nervous about the birth. I want them to be full-term, healthy, and then...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave any idea how you\u2019ll take care of them and work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as they\u2019re big enough, I\u2019m going home to my folks. My mom will help. She\u2019s very excited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good plan. With a supportive family, you should be able to work things out. There are options for you\u2014you can have John Stone in Grace Valley deliver you at Valley Hospital or I can attend you in birth with John\u2019s assistance. I don\u2019t administer anesthesia, but honey, these are twins\u2014they\u2019re going to be smaller than the average birth. Probably quicker and earlier. We\u2019ll keep up with ultrasounds to make sure they\u2019re in the right position. And we have John Stone, in case we need anything special, like a cesarean. He\u2019s wonderful. As luck would have it, we have a fabulous pediatrician. Did you know that Paul assisted in Vanni\u2019s delivery of Mattie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard something about that,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt was a wonderful birth. We had a birthing party. Everyone was there, at the general\u2019s house, waiting. Paul thought he couldn\u2019t handle it, yet he was perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis might be my only childbirth experience....\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t try to plan ahead like that,\u201d Mel advised. \u201cYou\u2019re young. Fertile. You have a few years to change your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis took me by surprise,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>Mel laughed. \u201cYeah?\u201d she said. \u201cBoth of mine took me by surprise, and I\u2019m the expert. Get dressed and I\u2019ll see you out front.\u201d</p><p>Abby was feeling real good about her appointment as she dressed. She even felt better about coming out to the town. This was going to be okay, she decided. People were nice, accepting. Mel was everything a woman could want in a midwife\u2014warm, humorous, delightful.</p><p>When she walked out front, Mel was waiting at the reception counter with Abby\u2019s chart. \u201cEverything looks great, Abby. Do you have enough vitamins or can I hook you up with a refill?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d Abby said. \u201cI brought a big supply from my last OB.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, then.\u201d</p><p>At the exact moment Abby\u2019s eyes grew round and startled, so did Cameron\u2019s. They locked eyes. Cameron was sitting behind the reception counter at the desk, looking at the computer. He\u2019d been with a patient in an exam room when she came in and hadn\u2019t seen her.</p> <p>Mel noticed they were looking at each other and said, \u201cAbby, meet Dr. Michaels. Cameron, Abby MacCall.\u201d</p><p>He stood. \u201cHello,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d she said.</p><p>He came around the desk and put out his hand, which she took after some hesitation. \u201cAbby...MacCall, was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Hi.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re staying here in Virgin River?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m visiting friends,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m new here myself,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Well, I\u2019m not staying long. I\u2019d better get going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you around,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d And she nearly ran out the door.</p> <p>Cameron\u2019s eyes were locked on her departure. When the door had been closed a few seconds, he pulled his eyes back to Mel\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI thought she was here for the duration. Something weird just happened there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cHow far along is Abby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour months. Why?\u201d</p><p>He dropped his gaze, looking briefly at his feet. Then he lifted his eyes to Mel\u2019s. \u201cI know her. I know her pretty well, but I haven\u2019t seen her in about...four months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a little confused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour months,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better clarify yourself.\u201d</p> <p>Cameron had had an indoctrination with Mel, training in this clinic so to speak, and knowing that she kept everything about patients strictly confidential, he said, \u201cI think I might be the father.\u201d</p><p>Mel\u2019s eyes grew round and her mouth hung open. It took her a moment to recover.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s she staying?\u201d Cameron asked.</p><p>\u201cVanni and Paul\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh fuck,\u201d he said. \u201cThat baby\u2019s mine,\u201d he said, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cBabies,\u201d she corrected. \u201cIt\u2019s twins.\u201d</p><p>He straightened abruptly, shocked. \u201cDouble fuck.\u201d He took his coat off the rack inside the front door, picked up his medical bag, which would be like an extension of his arm from now on, and said, \u201cI have to step out for a while. I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ll be. I\u2019m not expecting patients.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, wait,\u201d Mel said. \u201cJust one second.\u201d She dashed behind the desk and got into the supply cupboard. She pulled out a couple of large plastic bottles of prenatal vitamins. \u201cHere,\u201d she said, tossing them to him one at a time. \u201cIf you find yourself in a delicate spot, you can always pretend you\u2019re delivering these.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mel. Hey, I\u2019m sorry...\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cCan I assume you two don\u2019t have a...relationship?\u201d</p><p>He returned the smile, but his was hurt. Melancholic. \u201cDon\u2019t assume anything right now. Except\u2014we\u2019ve got a...situation.\u201d And then he was gone.</p><p>The knock on the Haggertys\u2019 front door came not ten minutes after Abby returned from her visit with the midwife. She ignored it and kept folding her things to put into a suitcase. She had come home to find the house deserted. The doorbell rang, then there was more knocking, but Abby didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>Rather than being worried about another confrontation with Cameron, the thing that occupied her most was what excuse she\u2019d give Vanni for leaving so abruptly. She wasn\u2019t prepared to say, \u201cThe man who knocked me up lives here!\u201d Next, she worried\u2014where would she go now? Nikki and Joe in Grants Pass was out of the question\u2014too close to the scene of the crime. Cameron knew Nikki was Abby\u2019s friend. Maybe some anonymous little town down the coast where she didn\u2019t know anyone.</p><p>The knocking had stopped. Seconds later she heard, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to run.\u201d</p><p>She jumped in surprise and whirled around, her face ashen. \u201cHow did you get in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe key under the flowerpot,\u201d he said. \u201cSame place I always kept mine. Pretty unimaginative. And pretty rare, this door locking in Virgin River. Abby, it\u2019s too late for you to run.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her chin, but her eyes were moist. She put a protective hand over her tummy.</p><p>He stepped into the bedroom doorway. \u201cWhat are you so afraid of, Abby? You think I\u2019d do something to hurt you? You know better than that. If I meant to hurt you, I had a perfect opportunity in Oregon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCameron, look, this is real complicated, and I can\u2019t let it get more complicated. Please.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged and put his hands in his pockets. He leaned against the door frame. \u201cCatch me up a little\u2014tell me why you\u2019d be so damn afraid of me making your life more complicated. And stop packing, for God\u2019s sake. I\u2019m not the enemy.\u201d</p><p>She crumbled to the bed and, putting her face in her hands, began to weep. Cautiously, not making any fast moves, Cameron sat next to her and put an arm around her shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say or do anything to make you nervous or afraid,\u201d he murmured. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want anyone to know about us, about that night, I\u2019ll never breathe a word,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cI never meant that night to happen,\u201d she said, lifting her head to turn teary eyes to him. \u201cI wasn\u2019t waiting for you in front of the elevators. I was going to my room. I wasn\u2019t about to spend the night with a stranger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did that night happen? How does a good friend of Vanessa\u2019s end up in my town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were all there\u2014it was our best friend Nikki\u2019s wedding. Joe is Paul\u2019s best friend. Even Jack and Mel were at the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me? And I didn\u2019t see a single familiar face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you had,\u201d she sniffed. \u201cIt would have saved us both a world of trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t force you. It wasn\u2019t a bad night for you. Not bad at all. And you already know\u2014for me, it was wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a huge misunderstanding,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve just been through a horrific divorce, complete with tabloid pictures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I read all about it. I was looking for you. I wanted another chance with you,\u201d he said.</p><p>She turned toward him, desperately grabbed the front of his jacket in both hands and said, \u201cIf you know who I am, where I am and that I\u2019m pregnant, and if you tell anyone those details, it could be very, very bad for me. You have no idea how bad.\u201d</p><p>Cameron wanted to know everything, but there was no mistaking panic. If he backed her into a corner, even slightly, she could get away from him again. \u201cI think you\u2019re okay here, Abby. I don\u2019t think anyone in Virgin River will make the connection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you did,\u201d she said, letting go of his jacket.</p><p>\u201cYeah. But I was looking for you. And not for a bad reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s arguable. But we\u2019ll go with your perception for now\u2014you don\u2019t know me well enough to give you peace of mind, but I\u2019m pretty easy to check out. Probably lots easier than you were. So\u2014you\u2019re hiding? From him or from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even think I had to hide from you. I had no idea you were here. Really, this can\u2019t get out. Please don\u2019t ask me why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA sticky prenup, I gather...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God! Who told you about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI read it in People magazine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God! How many people do you think know about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but no one here will realize you\u2019re that woman. I recognized your face on the cover and read the story because I was hungry for details. Not that I got any\u2014just the bare facts, which struck me as disgraceful. He left you after a few weeks, moved in with another woman and filed for divorce. There was mention that a prenuptial agreement might be a reason the divorce was delayed, but I have no idea how that plays into your drama. All I know is that the shit bag married you and left you. And I consider him scum of the earth for doing that. Not to mention a fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll be in a huge mess if you share that with anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, nodding. \u201cI\u2019ll be sure and not write home about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, we\u2019ll get serious. You\u2019re not my patient, but anything that happens in that clinic is confidential. Mel and I have access to all the records and they\u2019re protected by privacy. Even if I wanted to gossip about you, I can\u2019t. But there\u2019s no rule against talking to you\u2014and I have a personal stake in this. I have a feeling this has everything to do with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not yours.\u201d</p><p>He smiled patiently. \u201cYeah, they are, but don\u2019t panic. Right now making sure you\u2019re all right is the only thing that concerns me. I\u2019m not going to get pushy\u2014I understand how you must feel about it being just one night, unplanned, accidental. Abby\u2014I\u2019m sorry. This is my fault. I talked you into it, I had the condom accident...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had the pill accident,\u201d she relented. \u201cI was taking antibiotics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that explains it. You didn\u2019t know about the contraindication?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and sniffed. He produced a handkerchief and she wiped at her eyes and nose. \u201cI\u2019m not even sure they told me at the clinic. If they did, maybe I wasn\u2019t paying attention\u2014I was getting ready to go to that wedding and my own marriage was over. It was a stressful time and I had an ear infection. Really, I was half-deaf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why are you here?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI have to go real low profile right now. Oh hell, you\u2019re going to find out anyway. I hope you turn out to be someone I can trust because\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I show you that?\u201d he asked as gently as he could. \u201cI tried to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, Ross showed me that, too. For at least a couple of months he was the sweetest man I\u2019d ever known. A couple of months later he was back with the band, using drugs, his life a train wreck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, point taken. But I don\u2019t think I have much in common with him. I don\u2019t have a long history of infidelity and drug use, for one thing....\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut see, I don\u2019t really know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, I\u2019m real easy to check out. You could start with Vanni.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanni?\u201d she asked, surprised.</p><p>\u201cYup. Her first husband\u2019s mother tried to fix us up and we dated a little, before Paul. I had a practice in Grants Pass for several years\u2014ask the doctors there. Check with Mel\u2014she hired me. I\u2019m here for a year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cTheir doctor, a man I knew briefly, died a few months ago. They needed help and I happen to love this place. You\u2019ll see\u2014it\u2019s kind of special. Now, tell me about this problem you have. Not the pregnancy, that\u2019s not a problem. What has you hiding out in Virgin River, afraid someone will recognize you?\u201d</p><p>She sighed deeply and let it out. Her choices were few at this point. At least if he knew why she was so afraid he might keep his big mouth shut.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s what has you so wound up? Abby, that\u2019s only money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly money? It\u2019s a ton of money! I didn\u2019t stick him with any debt, but I feel lucky it was only a fortune in credit-card bills! I suppose a rock star can run up a big tab.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAbby,\u201d he said calmly. \u201cIt\u2019s legal details. It can be handled. We just have to figure out the best approach and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop! This is my problem! I need time to breathe!\u201d</p><p>Cameron wasn\u2019t too worried about things like prenups and credit-card debt. It wasn\u2019t that he thought he could buy their way out of this mess; he didn\u2019t have a ton of money. But he was sure there was a compromise in there somewhere. His biggest concern was getting the mother of his twins to trust him a little. He put a large hand over her slightly rounded middle. \u201cHave you been seeing a doctor since the beginning?\u201d Again she nodded, but this time she lifted her eyes. \u201cAnd everything is going fine? You\u2019re feeling all right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t miscarry from being a nervous wreck, I guess I must be in good shape.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYou should have called me. I could have helped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was afraid to get involved with someone I didn\u2019t know. I already screwed up on that once. You could be a lunatic for all I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could be, but I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t be sure of anything. Anyone. You have to understand that. Don\u2019t take it personally\u2014there are very good reasons for me to be cautious.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI smoked a little pot in college,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cOtherwise, I\u2019m relatively safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelatively?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019ve been known to do insane things like chuck a thriving practice to come to a town of six hundred for practically no money because it\u2019s quiet, clean and the people make you feel useful. My family thinks I\u2019ve lost my mind,\u201d he added, laughing. \u201cOther than that, I haven\u2019t had a severe personality shift since puberty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I saw you at the clinic, it scared me to death,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the first thing we have to work on,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is absolutely no reason to ever be afraid of me. I would never hurt you. Why would I? What would that get me? I\u2019d like a chance to get to know you a little bit. I told you that back in Oregon, that I\u2019d like to know more about you. I\u2019m not going to screw up that chance by being cruel. Forceful.\u201d He grinned. \u201cYou have that list. Forceful isn\u2019t on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you have very good manners,\u201d she added softly. And for the first time that day, she really looked at him. He looked different from that night. He was dressed in jeans, a denim shirt, laced boots.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to promise you\u2019re not going to run away,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll act like we just met, you don\u2019t even have to tell Vanni you knew me before. You\u2019re not my patient, it\u2019s not a problem for me to want to get to know you. I\u2019ll see you around. You\u2019ll show up at Jack\u2019s sometimes, and I get dinner there. And if I see you there sometimes, maybe we\u2019ll be friends. That\u2019s why I was trying to get in touch with you. Just to see you again. Give it a chance.\u201d He smiled at her. \u201cCome on. You like me. You know you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you going to explain some interest in a single, pregnant woman?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cAbby. Look in the mirror.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should get out of here before there\u2019s trouble....\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you can\u2019t go,\u201d he said calmly, firmly. He really didn\u2019t want to play hardball with her, but he shouldn\u2019t have to tell her what she would be able to put together after she thought about it a while\u2014he\u2019d turn the earth upside down to find her if she was carrying his children. Cam had the DNA to prove he was the father. \u201cYou have to give this a little time. I have a vested interest here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly why I didn\u2019t call you. It scares me. What if I get to know you and decide you\u2019re just not the kind of man I want involved with my children?\u201d</p><p>He smiled and lifted one eyebrow. \u201cReally? And what if I get to know you and decide you\u2019re not the kind of woman I want raising mine?\u201d The surprise was evident in her eyes, as was a little fear. \u201cJust because I\u2019m not carrying them and birthing them doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re any less mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d she moaned.</p> <p>He stood up, grabbed her hand and pulled her to her feet. He slipped an arm around her waist and pulled her carefully against him, holding her sweetly, tenderly, lightly caressing her back until she seemed to calm and lean against him. He pulled back and looked down into her frightened eyes. \u201cI just want you to remember one thing,\u201d he said softly. Then he lowered his lips to hers in a gentle kiss. Then he pulled back, smiling into her eyes. He kissed her again, again gently. And then he came down on her lips in a more serious kiss, moving over her mouth carefully, sensually, until her arms slowly and reluctantly encircled him, her eyelids dropping closed. He stayed on her lips until she kissed back, letting him open her lips. He tilted his head for a better angle, enjoying her response. Not knowing when he\u2019d get a chance like this again, he stayed with that kiss for a long time, tasting her mouth, being tasted by her. When he released her mouth, he smiled. \u201cAh,\u201d he whispered. \u201cYou do remember.\u201d And he kissed her again.</p><p>He released her grudgingly. \u201cThat\u2019s a good place to start. Nothing to fear, everything to gain. Now, I\u2019m going to get out of your hair so you can unpack.\u201d</p><p>Seventeen</p><p>The Valenzuela baby, Ness, was almost six weeks old when Luke called and asked if he might stop by with Art. Art was very excited; he got himself all cleaned up, put on freshly laundered clothes, his new heavy jacket and wiggled in the truck all the way there. \u201cSettle down a little,\u201d Luke said with a laugh. \u201cYou know Mike and Brie. It\u2019s just a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t touch it,\u201d he said by way of a promise.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to touch the baby, you have to ask politely. And if the answer is no, it\u2019s no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnd we should be kind of quiet around the baby,\u201d he said. And Art nodded.</p><p>Luke invited Art to carry the brightly wrapped gift, all pink bows and gewgaws with a pair of crochet booties tied into the bow. When Mike opened the door, Art pushed it at him proudly. \u201cThanks,\u201d Mike said with a laugh. \u201cWould you like to come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Art said. \u201cI\u2019ll be quiet. Can I touch it? The baby?\u201d</p><p>Mike held the door open. \u201cMy wife handles all special requests. But she\u2019s very generous. Let me get her.\u201d</p><p>Mike dropped the gift on the coffee table and disappeared into the house. A few seconds later he was following Brie into the living room. She held the wrapped baby against her shoulder. She grinned at Art and said, \u201cIt\u2019s so nice to see you, Art. How\u2019ve you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been very good.\u201d</p><p>Brie lowered the baby. \u201cWell, Art, meet Ness. And Ness, this is Art.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said a little breathlessly. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s sleeping. When she\u2019s awake she has a very big cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery big,\u201d Mike affirmed. \u201cWhen she\u2019s fifteen, she\u2019s going to kill me with it. It\u2019s already one of those girl-screams. Terrifying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArt, if you\u2019d like, you can hold her.\u201d</p><p>Art got a stricken look on his face for a second. Then he wiped his hands on his trousers and put them out, palms up.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Brie laughed. \u201cNot like that. Come over to the rocker, take your jacket off and sit down. Get comfortable. I want you to hold her like this,\u201d she said, demonstrating cradling the baby in her arms. Art very quickly positioned himself in the rocker and got his arms ready. Brie placed the baby in his arms and said, \u201cNow, don\u2019t squeeze her\u2014she\u2019s very fragile. And hold her just like this.\u201d</p><p>He stared down at the baby for a second in awe, in wonder, and then he lifted his eyes to Brie\u2019s and broke into a huge smile. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t feel like anything!\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cI know. It takes some getting used to.\u201d She sat down right beside Art, just in case he needed her.</p><p>\u201cCan I get you something to drink, Luke?\u201d Mike asked. \u201cAnd Art, when you\u2019re done holding the baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hold the baby,\u201d Art said. And then very quietly he said to her, \u201cShh. Don\u2019t let the bedbugs bite.\u201d</p><p>That dug into Luke. It left him speechless for a moment, seeing Art so tender and sweet with the baby, echoing Shelby\u2019s words. Then he recovered himself and said, \u201cAh, no thanks, Mike. But we did have another reason for coming to visit. Me and Art, we might need a little advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Mike said, sitting down. \u201cWhat can we do?\u201d</p><p>Luke sat forward a little in his chair. \u201cI haven\u2019t explained the details about how Art and I were introduced,\u201d he began. To curious townsfolk, he had said that Art \u201cturned up\u201d and could use some work. So he told the real story, from finding him sleeping in one of the cabins, a black eye, on the run, to how he gave him shelter for chores. Then he ran down his visit to Eureka, to the grocery store and the group home. \u201cArt\u2019s mother\u2019s gone now and he doesn\u2019t want to go back to that group home, doesn\u2019t want to work for Stan at the grocery store, and I\u2019d like him to stay where he is. He\u2019s a good friend and a big help. But we don\u2019t want to break any rules or laws. I need to know who to talk to, how to proceed, so we do it right.\u201d</p><p>Mike said, \u201cWhew. Complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he has to go back to a group home, it can\u2019t be that one. And if there has to be a next one, I\u2019ll visit him every day to be sure it\u2019s all right, if I have to. I\u2019d really like to make arrangements for him to stay in Virgin River where he\u2019s pretty happy. But we have to do it right.\u201d</p><p>Brie gave her attention to Art and very gently asked, \u201cArt, how old are you now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirty years old. November seventeen. We had a cake, me and Luke and Shewby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you earn money at the grocery store?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnd did you sign your paychecks so they could be cashed?\u201d Again he nodded. \u201cDid you sign any other checks?\u201d He nodded again. \u201cAnd who did you give the checks to?\u201d Brie asked him.</p><p>\u201cShirwey or Stan,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnd did they give you money?\u201d</p><p>He smiled and nodded. \u201cFifteen dollars every week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Art\u2014do you happen to know\u2014are you a ward of the state? A ward of the court?\u201d</p><p>He furrowed his brow.</p><p>Brie, a former Sacramento prosecutor and currently a consultant to the Humboldt County D.A.\u2019s office, looked at her watch and then turned her attention to Luke. \u201cI can run this by the district attorney, but here\u2019s my guess\u2014Art is a thirty-year-old man. An adult. He might be collecting social security benefits because his parents are deceased and he\u2019s disabled. He could be in a group home that\u2019s subsidized by the state through social services, but if he\u2019s not a ward of the state, he\u2019s not obligated to stay there. If he leaves, the subsidy ends and he gives a change of address for his benefit checks. The D.A. can find out his status.</p><p>\u201cThat other matter,\u201d she went on, \u201cshould probably be turned over for investigation. I can still get the D.A. on the phone. Do you have some names for me?\u201d</p><p>Luke pulled a piece of paper out of his jacket pocket\u2014names, addresses and phone numbers for Shirley and Stan\u2014and handed it to Brie.</p><p>\u201cMike?\u201d she asked, standing. \u201cYou\u2019re in charge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Mike said, but he waited until Brie left the room before he very casually and unobtrusively moved himself to the chair near Art, just in case there was a reason to be close, though Art was doing great with the baby. He balanced his elbows on his knees, clasped his hands together and leaned toward Art. \u201cSo, Art. That your first baby?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Art grinned. \u201cUh-huh. Is it your first baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is my very first. We did very good for our first, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good,\u201d he agreed. \u201cI like how her hair stands straight up like that.\u201d Then he focused his eyes on Mike\u2019s. \u201cI can stay with Luke now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEverything\u2019s going to work out fine,\u201d Mike said. \u201cYou asked the right person. Brie knows everything about everything.\u201d</p><p>Twenty minutes passed and Art didn\u2019t tire of holding the sleeping baby at all. Then Brie came back into the room. \u201cWell, it\u2019s all good. Art can live wherever he wants to. You\u2019ll have to go to Social Services and collect copies of some of his vital papers\u2014birth certificate, social security benefit change, new picture ID in case he ever wants to travel via airlines, a whole bunch of stuff. He should start receiving his benefit checks a few weeks after you complete that. If you want a subsidy for giving him housing...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need that,\u201d Luke said immediately.</p><p>\u201cRethink that\u2014health care is part of the subsidy and that\u2019s important. Unless he becomes your dependent and you can put him on your military health care. In any case, you\u2019ll have to apply to either one. A little paperwork will tidy things up.\u201d Then she grinned. \u201cOkay, a lot of tiresome paperwork.\u201d</p><p>Luke stood. \u201cStan and Shirl?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s being looked into. From the reaction of the D.A., I\u2019d say their party\u2019s just about over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez,\u201d Luke said, running a hand over the short-cropped hair on his head. \u201cI had no idea it was all going to be so simple!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I know the right people here now,\u201d Brie said. She leaned down and ran a hand over her daughter\u2019s head. Then she leaned down and gave that little head a kiss. When she straightened, Art bent his big head and gave the baby a small kiss. \u201cWelcome to Virgin River, Art,\u201d Brie said with a smile.</p><p>That night Luke couldn\u2019t wait to tell Shelby how smoothly things appeared to be working out for Art, thanks to Brie.</p><p>\u201cSo he can stay with you forever?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cForever\u2019s a long time, but he can stay here while he wants to,\u201d Luke said.</p> <p>\u201cBut what about when you sell the cabins?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, they\u2019re not for sale yet,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cIf I do sell them, I can find a place for Art that\u2019s safe and secure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf,\u201d she said, her heart racing suddenly.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve gotten kind of comfortable here.\u201d He laughed softly. \u201cSurprises the hell out of me. I thought I\u2019d be stir-crazy by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were talking about a flying job. Have you applied anywhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve talked to a couple of outfits that have openings\u2014a news chopper in Dallas. A rescue outfit in Georgia. Nothing has my name stamped on it yet. I\u2019ve only been out of the army six months. There\u2019s plenty of time. Right now the important thing is that Art feels okay.\u201d</p><p>Shelby didn\u2019t say anything right away. She waited for him to say something about them\u2014their future. About it being important that she felt okay. About having plans that included them both. But nothing came. Because nothing had changed.</p><p>\u201cWhile I\u2019m here,\u201d Luke said, \u201cI should be able to keep an eye on Art, it\u2019s not like he\u2019s high maintenance.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell,\u201d Shelby said. \u201cThat\u2019s great news. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be very happy together.\u201d</p><p>Loving Luke was like a drug for Shelby. She wasn\u2019t sure exactly how long to stay in this relationship or how to let it go, but one thing she did know for sure, he wasn\u2019t offering her anything more than what they had together, and what they had wasn\u2019t binding in any way. It was more than just sex, but intimacy with him held her captive. There was also affection. In terms of companionship, friendship, she felt secure; it was clear he cared about her. The problem was that without words of love, without commitment, the day could come without warning that he would say, \u201cI don\u2019t feel enough to keep this going any longer.\u201d And that day would kill her.</p><p>It was that moment Muriel had warned her about. The moment of clarity that signaled it was time to think about moving on.</p><p>The weather had been fairly mild until late January and then a blast from the north covered the mountains and brought in February with rain, snow, sleet and ice. The days were short and, given the overcast, dark. The snow didn\u2019t stick for long but the ice was unpredictable and treacherous. The California Department of Forestry was clearing the mountain roads of debris and spreading sand along the steep and curving roads. There were more than the usual number of one-car accidents caused by poor visibility or slippery roads. Everyone in Virgin River was bundled up.</p><p>Shelby headed for town one afternoon to spend some time talking with Mel; Mel was always compassionate but straight to the point with her advice. Uncle Walt warned Shelby to watch those patches of black ice. All the way into town, she was rehearsing what she would say, how she would explain that nothing had gone wrong with Luke, but it also hadn\u2019t gone quite right. That Luke was ready to take care of Art and make sure he had all he needed, but hadn\u2019t even said he would miss Shelby\u2014that said it all. She needed to be told she was loved. She didn\u2019t think that was greedy.</p><p>She slowed as she saw something up ahead that looked like a pile of trash by the side of the road. Also, some dirt on the shoulder was visible through the snow. Then from that pile at the edge of the road, there was movement. As she drew near, a child stood up while another person remained down. She hit the brakes and skidded, so she eased up through a possible spin until she stopped safely.</p><p>She jumped out of the Jeep and what she saw stunned and confused her. A little girl, maybe six years old, stood beside a teenage boy who sat on the ground, gripping his shoulder with one hand and grimacing in pain. He had a gash on his head and his arm hung at an unnatural angle. The little girl was sobbing, tears running down her cheeks. Her eyes were wide and frightened.</p><p>Shelby knelt beside them. She ran her hands over the little girl\u2019s head, shoulders and arms. \u201cWhat happened here?\u201d she asked them.</p><p>\u201cThe bus,\u201d the boy said, turning his head to point down the hill. Halfway down, a hundred feet at least, that big yellow bus was balanced very tentatively, the back end up against a huge tree, the front end pointing downward. If one thing shifted, that bus could head down the hill like a torpedo, hitting every tree and bump in its path before crashing at the bottom, a long way down.</p><p>\u201cHoly God,\u201d Shelby muttered. She bent to the boy, who grimaced in pain again. \u201cAre there kids on the bus?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s full o\u2019 kids,\u201d he groaned. \u201cWhen it slid off the road, we started to get out the back emergency door.\u201d Tears ran down his cheeks from the pain. \u201cI only got Mindy out before the thing shifted and slid farther.\u201d He groaned. \u201cI took a dive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd crawled up the hill?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cIf they try to get out, it could go. My arm. It\u2019s outta the socket. You gotta pull it hard. Get it back in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang on, buddy,\u201d she said. \u201cJust hang on.\u201d She walked over to the edge of the hill, framed her mouth with her hands and yelled as loud as she could. \u201cDon\u2019t move! I\u2019m getting help!\u201d She helped the boy to his feet, then took the little girl\u2019s hand. She opened the back door of the Jeep for them.</p><p>He struggled to get in. \u201cCan\u2019t you do this arm?\u201d he asked. \u201cAll you have to do is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re only a couple of minutes from town, just hang on and let a doctor do it. You can make it. Work with me here,\u201d she said. Through some slipping and sliding, she got them into the Jeep. She punched the odometer to zero to record the exact distance to the scene. As she headed the rest of the way to town, she asked a couple of questions. \u201cYou have any idea how many kids are on the bus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know exactly. Some didn\u2019t go today because of weather,\u201d he said. \u201cAbout twenty. Mostly the little ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know how it happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIce,\u201d he said simply. \u201cWe fishtailed. I thought she had it, but then the back end of the bus slid down the hill. Lucky we weren\u2019t crushed, me and Mindy. We were coming out the back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know if anyone else is hurt in the bus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see anything after it started down the hill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMindy? You okay, honey? Anything hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy knees,\u201d she cried. \u201cI want my mommy!\u201d Tears ran down her chafed cheeks.</p><p>\u201cHow long ago?\u201d Shelby asked the boy.</p><p>\u201cNot too long. You came along right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSheer luck,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m so glad I did.\u201d As she neared town, there was sand sprinkled on the road. But what she saw panicked her\u2014parents waiting inside their cars for the bus to bring their children. At least they were inside the cars and might assume the bus was running late because of weather. She hoped they\u2019d take no notice of her hauling kids into the clinic at the other end of the block. She pulled up in front. \u201cStay right here while I get the doctor. You have to give me sixty seconds. Can you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d the boy said. \u201cHurry.\u201d</p><p>Shelby ran into the clinic. As she entered, Cameron came out of the office and Mel came from the kitchen. Shelby tried to keep her voice calm. \u201cI\u2019ve got two kids in my Jeep. A little girl about six, scratched up, a boy about sixteen, gash on his head and dislocated shoulder. The school bus went off the road. Four point six miles west of town. Twenty kids are trapped in a bus that\u2019s balanced against a tree and could slip down the mountain any second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Mel said. \u201cLet\u2019s get the kids in here,\u201d she said, heading for the door.</p><p>Shelby grabbed the sleeve of her sweater. \u201cListen, there are parents waiting at the bus stop. If they figure out there\u2019s an accident, they\u2019re going to rush out there, maybe attempt a rescue, maybe cause that bus to dislodge and crash down the hill.\u201d</p><p>Mel looked at Shelby calmly. \u201cCall 911. Then call Jack and tell him about the accident and where to go\u2014tell him about the parents. He\u2019ll know what to do. Then call Connie at the corner store and tell her we have an emergency. Ask her to walk down here, calmly, as if nothing\u2019s wrong. We\u2019ll take care of the kids in your Jeep and the minute they\u2019re stable, we\u2019ll have Connie stay here and head out to the scene. Got that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d Shelby said, heading for the phone.</p><p>She was already on the phone to Jack when Mel and Cameron were bringing the kids into the clinic. She watched Cam take the boy into the treatment room as Mel took the little girl into the exam room. Shelby was on the phone to Connie when she heard a loud cry from the treatment room\u2014Cameron had likely yanked that shoulder to pop it back into the joint.</p><p>Shelby paced for a couple of seconds, waiting. Then she picked up the phone and called Walt, sending him out to help. Then thinking that if anyone had heavy equipment that could be useful, it would be Paul; she asked her uncle to find him in case he could help. And then, thankfully, Connie came in the door. Right at that moment, Mel came out of the exam room and faced her.</p><p>\u201cWe have a school-bus accident,\u201d she said, reaching for her coat. \u201cFirst aid will probably be necessary. Maybe triage. We have to go out there right away. There\u2019s a small child in the exam room\u2014her name is Mindy. She appears to be all right, just some scrapes, but you have to get her help to contact her mother. Cam\u2019s treating an older boy. Someone has to stay here in the clinic, Connie. My kids are sleeping in the kitchen, due to wake up. Call for help if you need to, but I need to have Shelby with me. Can you manage this?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said, shrugging. \u201cI\u2019ll give Joy a call right away. She\u2019ll come.\u201d</p><p>Cameron came out of the treatment room. \u201cConnie, sixteen-year-old boy in the treatment room. He has shoulder pain from a dislocation, repaired, and bandage on his head. I gave him pain medication and told him to stay right where he is, resting. You can call his parents, but I don\u2019t want him to leave until someone can look at him a little later. Tell him to be patient\u2014it\u2019ll either be one of us or paramedics.\u201d He reached for his coat and medical bag. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Jack was the first to arrive at the scene of the accident, Preacher not far behind him. He got ropes and pulleys out of his truck bed, rapidly secured it to a tree and rappelled down the hill to the stranded bus. The hillside was slick with ice and snow and he slid around, landing on his knees more than once. He was almost there when he glanced up and saw Preacher standing at the top of the hill, looking down at him.</p> <p>The ignition on the bus was off. It just sat there, its back end up against a big tree trunk. There was no movement. He got as close to the driver\u2019s window as he could. \u201cMolly?\u201d</p><p>Slowly, cautiously, the window slid open. Molly looked out at him. She had a cut on her chin and a big, purple bruise on her forehead. \u201cJack,\u201d she said in a breath.</p><p>\u201cCan you keep everyone in the bus still?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting for rescue and paramedics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be still. No one\u2019s moving. But we\u2019re pretty scared in here.\u201d</p><p>He heard some weak crying in the bus. \u201cYeah, I know. What have you got for injuries? Have any idea?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPast these first couple of rows, no idea, Jack. Everyone says something hurts, but they can hold still.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at the rear of the bus, hooked up against a big sequoia. It looked as if a little jostling could bust it loose and send it sailing down the hill. \u201cHere\u2019s the thing, Molly\u2014this bus isn\u2019t stable at all. It looks bad out here. We need rescue to brace the bus before taking people out. Understand?\u201d</p><p>She pulled her head in and spoke to the kids, calmly and firmly. \u201cWe can\u2019t move a muscle,\u201d she told them all. \u201cWe have to be perfectly still until the bus is braced and can\u2019t slide. Rescue is coming. Then they\u2019ll get us out. Without moving a muscle, tell me you understand,\u201d she instructed.</p><p>Jack heard small, careful voices from inside. \u201cHow many, Molly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEighteen,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOkay, could be a while. Close the window. Don\u2019t let the heat out. I\u2019ll stay right here by your window until they get here. It\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled weakly. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said. And then the driver\u2019s window slowly closed.</p><p>The temptation to try to get as many kids out as possible was almost irresistible. And the thought that he could be holding himself here, hanging on to a rope, right next to the bus, and see it plummet down the hill and crash, was enough to make his insides grip and knot. The hardest thing about any kind of life-threatening situation was always the wait. Taking action, that wasn\u2019t as hard. Sometimes you just moved, not thinking, performing on instinct, getting it done. Doing nothing, waiting for help to arrive, it was just torture.</p><p>Jack moved to the right enough to brace himself against a tree trunk so he wouldn\u2019t have to hang on for the duration. He watched the bus, watched through the windows. It was cold as hell; he hoped they could do something before it became a toss-up as to what was worse, those kids plunging down the mountain or freezing to death in there.</p><p>It seemed a lifetime before he heard the sound of engines. \u201cPreach\u2014you have to keep everyone but emergency back! The kids in the bus are trying to hold still, and it\u2019s hard!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYo!\u201d he heard back from the top. \u201cI\u2019ve got help up here, Jack!\u201d</p><p>Slowly the sky grew darker and it seemed an eternity before what sounded like heavy equipment started arriving\u2014fire trucks, he assumed. Suddenly the dusk was lit by a blast of light coming from above; high-powered beams slanted down the hill, illuminating the bus.</p><p>It grew colder; the wind picked up. There was a sound from the top of the hill that sounded like a jackhammer. Finally two firefighters rappelled down the hill. One went to the driver\u2019s window while the other slid close to the side of the bus and used a flashlight to view the undercarriage.</p><p>A third man in heavy turnouts and boots came down the hill, being lowered by a thick cable. As Jack watched, the three of them went to work under the bus, attaching the cable to the axle with giant hooks. He couldn\u2019t resist checking his watch\u2014they were at it for almost a half hour when two emerged from beneath the bus. The third said to Jack, \u201cCan you get a child up that hill?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou bet,\u201d he said. \u201cI can come back for more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll let you know,\u201d he said. Then he went to the rear of the bus and carefully pulled open the emergency door. The bus wobbled slightly, but held, secured by the cable.</p><p>The firefighter at the door shouted into the bus. \u201cI need your attention, I need you to listen carefully and do just what I ask. The bus is still rocky, unstable. We\u2019re going to take you off now, one at a time. Slowly. And we have to take you from the front of the bus first, keeping the weight in the rear. You have to walk down the aisle one at a time, very slowly, very carefully. The next one doesn\u2019t start down the aisle till the one before is off the bus. Does everyone understand? If you don\u2019t understand, ask me now before we start.\u201d There was no response.</p><p>Jack shifted himself off the tree and held on to his ropes, moving sideways until he could get near where the firefighter was at the rear door.</p><p>\u201cOkay, driver\u2014how about you first,\u201d he yelled. \u201cShow them how it\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDriver last,\u201d she shouted back. \u201cI don\u2019t leave my kids. Becky, you go. No one has to show you. When Becky\u2019s out, Anna goes. Easy does it. Almost over, kids.\u201d</p><p>As soon as the trembling little girl cleared the door, the firefighter grabbed her, passed her to Jack. \u201cHold on around my neck, angel,\u201d he whispered. \u201cAlmost home.\u201d And as he slowly pulled himself up the hill, the rescue team was moving down past him, rappelling gear and harnesses in place.</p><p>The sight at the top of the hill almost threw him into a state of shock. The lights that flooded the area were Paul\u2019s construction beams; the cable that held the bus was attached to a brace that came off a forklift that had been bolted right into the asphalt, also Paul\u2019s. In addition to rescue equipment, there were vehicles everywhere. A paramedic rig and fire truck sat right at the top of the hill. Next to it on one side the Grace Valley ambulance with Docs Stone and Hudson at the ready; on the other side stood Mel, Cameron and Shelby beside the Hummer, the back hatch open. And there were so many people, it looked as though the entire town was present, all being kept behind a perimeter set up by sheriff\u2019s deputies.</p><p>As soon as he put the little girl on her feet, there was a huge cheer. Cameron rushed forward and scooped the girl up, taking her to the back of the Hummer to look her over.</p><p>Right behind Jack, another child was brought up the hill, and again the cheer. Slowly, one by one, eighteen kids ranging in age from six to sixteen, were delivered to the top of the hill. There was a possible broken collarbone, a few head lacerations, lots of bruises and scrapes, and one possibly serious head injury was rushed off to Valley Hospital by Dr. Stone in the ambulance.</p><p>Jack walked to the edge of the hill to watch the last passenger come up the hill, being aided by two firefighters. Molly. He reached out for her hand to pull her the rest of the way. Blood ran down her chin and had dripped onto her jacket. The second she reached the top, the town cheered.</p><p>She looked up at Jack with tears in her eyes. \u201cAre they crazy?\u201d she asked in a low voice. \u201cI thought they\u2019d tar and feather me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor ice?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cI swear to God, I was going slow, for the ice...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMolly, you kept your head. You kept eighteen kids still for two hours. You probably saved all their lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack, I don\u2019t know that I was ever so scared.\u201d</p><p>He put a hand around the back of her neck and pulled her against his chest. \u201cYeah. Me, too.\u201d He took a breath. \u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>Luke had gone to the bar, hoping to get dinner to take home for himself, Art and Shelby. Upon finding it closed, he heard about the accident and, like everyone else who heard, headed that way. There were so many people in the thick of a rescue that was well under way by the time he got there, he didn\u2019t get too close. He stayed back behind the perimeter tape, behind a crowd of parents and townsfolk, watching in fascination as a team that combined men from town\u2014Paul and some of his crew, Preacher, the general, Mike V.\u2014and the rescue team worked. They bolted down a brace, fastened a heavy cable from a huge spool and ran it down the hill.</p><p>While this was going on, he saw Shelby with Mel and Cameron, saw her rush forward to lead a child to the Humvee for medical evaluation and treatment. She was in the thick of it, helping to administer first aid, soothing crying children, calming disgruntled parents, snapping to attention with every request from either Mel, Cameron or even a paramedic. She looked as if she\u2019d been doing it all her life.</p><p>Finally, after standing for well over an hour, his breath swirling around, he saw the firefighters bring up the bus driver, the very one who\u2019d splattered him on his way into town. He\u2019d been listening to the talk in the crowd of towns-people, that Jack had been down there, hanging on to a rope, keeping her calm while she had the bigger job of keeping all the children from wiggling around or trying to escape the bus.</p><p>He saw Jack give her a hug, then saw Shelby go to her, take her hand and lead her to the paramedic rig to have her bleeding chin looked at. Mel followed, watching them treat her injury.</p><p>People were beginning to leave, or follow their children to the hospital or take uninjured kids home. Road-construction barriers were set up around the brace that held the cable that held the bus; California Highway Patrol was directing traffic out of the area. And Luke walked toward Shelby as she was packing supplies back into the Humvee.</p><p>\u201cHey, there,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s new?\u201d</p><p>She jumped in surprise. \u201cLuke! How long have you been here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLittle over an hour,\u201d he said. \u201cBy the time I got here, the fire department, police and paramedics were all over the place and I had to stay behind the barrier with everyone else. I didn\u2019t want to distract you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see that bus down there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to get too close. There was an awful lot going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe floodlights are still on it. You should look. It\u2019ll scare you to death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo\u2014what they\u2019re saying is, you found a couple of hurt kids who got out before it slid down the hill and went for help.\u201d</p><p>Before she could answer, Mel was beside them. \u201cCorrect,\u201d she answered for Shelby. \u201cYou would have been impressed, Luke. She never flinched. She knew all the right things to do and remained perfectly calm. Efficient, skilled, confident.\u201d Mel smiled. \u201cShe\u2019s going to be an incredible nurse. You should be so proud of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Luke replied. \u201cAnd not at all surprised.\u201d He draped an arm around her shoulders.</p><p>And Shelby thought, Oh God. I have to get this over with. She didn\u2019t need advice from Mel or anyone else. She\u2019d given him every chance, but he never said a word about how he felt about her, not a syllable about wanting a life with her. She had to make herself move on before she couldn\u2019t. Tears gathered in her eyes. \u201cLet me finish up here, Luke. I\u2019m going to follow Mel and Cameron back to the clinic, help clean up the Humvee, restock it. I\u2019ll catch up with you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you crying?\u201d he asked softly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI might be overwhelmed.\u201d</p><p>He frowned slightly at the glistening in her eyes. \u201cSure,\u201d he said.

No one in the Booth family was riding; just walking from the house to the stable to tend the horses was torture. Walt had put a coffeepot in the tack room because he couldn\u2019t keep a cup hot when carrying it from the house. Even though the stable was heated, Shelby wore heavy gloves, a scarf around her neck, her suede jacket...and her ostrich boots. She wore them all the time.</p><p>Walt came into the stable while she was feeding the horses. \u201cHey, I\u2019m way ahead of you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou usually are. Damn cold out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the tropics in here. Let\u2019s get a cup of coffee while these horses feed. I have something great to tell you.\u201d</p><p>He lifted an eyebrow and threw an arm wide for her to precede him into the tack room. She poured a couple of mugs and dressed one with powdered cream and sweetener for her uncle. \u201cI talked to one of the administrators at San Francisco State. It\u2019s not official, but it looks like they\u2019re going to let me in. And if they do, she said I can enroll for summer classes if I feel like it. And as soon as I get down there, she\u2019ll write me a pass to audit. It wouldn\u2019t hurt to sit in on a few classes. That might give me an edge.\u201d She grinned largely. \u201cI won\u2019t be too far away, Uncle Walt. I should see you, Vanni and Paul pretty often.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd what about Humboldt State?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou mentioned...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think San Francisco might suit me better,\u201d she said. \u201cMore potential social life, for one thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that Humboldt is right here,\u201d he said. \u201cClose to the people you love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. And I\u2019ve been so happy here with you, Uncle Walt, but I\u2019m ready to spread my wings.\u201d</p><p>He thought about that for a moment, then said, \u201cThat\u2019s good news, Shelby,\u201d he said, toasting her with his coffee cup. \u201cTo you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Thing is, I\u2019m going to want to go early to find a place off campus. There\u2019s housing\u2014mostly dorm housing\u2014not available to me until next fall when I\u2019m a full-time student. But I\u2019ve been thinking about it and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m up to that lifestyle, seven years older than the average freshman. This is good, that I\u2019m kind of forced to find my own place. I can always change my mind later, move onto campus, but I bet I stay in my own place. Maybe I\u2019ll have roommates at some point, if I find students I have something in common with, starting with age and maybe life experience.\u201d She smiled. \u201cTo all of you I\u2019m so young, to them, I\u2019ll seem old.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can understand that.\u201d</p><p>She looked down into her cup, then up. \u201cI\u2019m going to want to go real soon, Uncle Walt. Get settled in. Meet people. You know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s real soon?\u201d he asked suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cReal soon,\u201d she repeated. \u201cBut first, I\u2019m taking that vacation I promised myself. I\u2019m going to spend two full weeks on the beach in Maui.\u201d She laughed. \u201cIf I wasn\u2019t tempted to do that before, this weather for the last couple of weeks sure sealed the deal. I have to see the sun again!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou deserve it. When do you suppose you\u2019ll do that?\u201d</p><p>She gazed up at him with clear eyes. \u201cRight away. A couple of days...\u201d He was speechless; his mouth might\u2019ve dropped open slightly. \u201cI made all my arrangements. Did you know you can do all of that on the computer?\u201d She laughed again. \u201cEverything from plane tickets to hotels and car rentals.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cYes, I knew that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve never gone anywhere. Not since I went to spend summers and holidays with you as a kid and you always sent the tickets. Really, it\u2019s so slick. Punch in a few dates and times, give \u2019em a credit card and\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShelby,\u201d he interrupted, \u201cwhat\u2019s this about?\u201d</p><p>She fixed her lips into a tight line, sighed, then said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like it, but I\u2019ve been here six months. It\u2019s time for me to get on with things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI realize that, but this is abrupt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI apologize, it must seem so\u2014but I\u2019ve actually been working on the details and didn\u2019t want to say anything until I had an agenda. I hope that doesn\u2019t upset you, Uncle Walt, because I\u2019ll be back to visit. No reason I can\u2019t. Not now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mood\u2019s been a little different lately....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking so hard about this,\u201d she said with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me, but does Luke have anything to do with this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, of course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure about that?\u201d</p><p>She turned away from her uncle. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about things and...\u201d She turned back. \u201cListen, it\u2019s tempting to just stay here, like this, forever. I could travel from here, go to school from here... There\u2019s no future in it, that\u2019s all. I\u2019m thinking like a boxer\u2014I want to go out a winner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas he hurt you, Shelby?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cJust the opposite. Things are nice enough that if I stay in this pattern for six more months, I might stay for six more years. But, Uncle Walt, it\u2019s never going to become all I\u2019d like it to be. It won\u2019t change. My clothes will hang in your closet and I\u2019ll spend most of my nights at his house. In the long term, I\u2019m looking for something more than that....\u201d</p><p>Walt pursed his lips and shook his head. Under his breath he muttered, \u201cThat sorry son of a bitch...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow stop,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cYou\u2019re surprised by this? Be fair\u2014I had a big crush on Luke. He was always wonderful to me and it would probably be just fine with him if I didn\u2019t move on. But it\u2019s going nowhere. In the end, I\u2019d be selling out. That\u2019s not what I intend to do.\u201d</p><p>He looked at the floor and shook his head. Then he took a slow sip of his coffee.</p><p>\u201cRemember that song, Uncle Walt?\u201d she asked him. \u201c\u2018Me and Mrs. Jones, we got a thing going on...?\u2019 Me and Mr. Riordan, we have a thing going on...and the next man in my life is going to be more than a thing. I want the whole deal. And Luke said from the start, if I was looking for something like that, I wouldn\u2019t find it with him. Really, if I\u2019m honest with myself, I never doubted that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is your decision, then?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, absolutely. I haven\u2019t even mentioned this to Luke yet. And you\u2019re under strict orders\u2014you are not to treat him like he\u2019s done something wrong. Do you hear me? Because if you do, you\u2019re going to be in big trouble with me. Are we clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I want.\u201d Then she laughed. \u201cGive him a year, he\u2019ll be so damn sorry he let me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think so, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you bet. He\u2019ll manage to find women\u2014he\u2019s good-looking and can be real charming. But he won\u2019t find one like me. And once I make a clean break and get myself in a new life, he\u2019s gonna be shit outta luck.\u201d</p><p>Walt chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re a lot tougher than you look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. You shouldn\u2019t underestimate me so much. It\u2019s your biggest mistake. And it\u2019ll be Luke\u2019s, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, all I want is that you be happy. If these plans make you happy, then I\u2019m on board. Just as long as he hasn\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t. He\u2019s been great to me. But I want more than he has to give. I want it all, Uncle Walt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you go get it. And let me know what I can do to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said. She glanced around. \u201cI can finish with these horses in five minutes. Go read your paper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure? I could help you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, I\u2019m almost done. Go,\u201d she said with a laugh, taking the coffee cup out of his hand. \u201cI got it.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her brow. \u201cYou\u2019re incredible, Shelby. I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Uncle Walt,\u201d she said. \u201cThat means a lot.\u201d</p><p>He left the stable. She watched out the door as he trudged up the hill. When he was far enough away, when she was sure he wasn\u2019t coming back, tears welled in her eyes and rolled down her cheeks. Then she went to Chico, clung to his neck and sobbed against his cheek.</p><p>Luke was just pulling a shepherd\u2019s pie Preacher had made out of the oven when he saw the glow of headlights flash by the window. He took a bottle of merlot he thought Shelby would like from the rack and got the corkscrew out of the drawer, but the front door didn\u2019t open. He stared at it expectantly and when she didn\u2019t come in, he went to the door and opened it, stepping outside.</p><p>Her Jeep sat right in front of the porch, but she didn\u2019t seem to be there. He was just thinking she must have gone to invite Art to dinner when he caught sight of her sitting in one of the chairs on the porch. She was bundled up in her suede jacket, a thick scarf around her neck and her hands tucked in her pockets. \u201cWhat are you doing out here?\u201d he asked, confused. \u201cYou must be half-frozen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was going to knock in a second,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cKnock?\u201d He laughed. \u201cSince when do you knock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke, I\u2019m not coming inside tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He stepped toward her. \u201cShelby, what\u2019s going on? I have a fire\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, I knew this was coming, but when the bus went down the hill, full of kids, it was a defining moment for me. I\u2019m going to do that\u2014help to save lives. Oh, I hope I don\u2019t see any more buses go down a mountainside, but if they do, they\u2019ll need someone like me to help, and that\u2019s what I want to do. Luke, I...\u201d She took a breath. \u201cI know you care about me a lot. Hard as you try to hide it, I know you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Course I do,\u201d he said, taking a step toward her.</p><p>She stood from the chair. \u201cRemember when I said that I wanted to fall in love someday? But that I didn\u2019t expect it from you? When I said it, it was true. But then I fell in love with you. I didn\u2019t do it on purpose, but I did. And you didn\u2019t love me back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShelby, I loved you every night, sometimes more than once a night.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him, but there was definitely no humor in it. \u201cYeah, I know. You sure stepped up that way. Thing is, I need to hear that you love me, that you want a life with me. I need more than sex every night. I\u2019ll be honest with you, it\u2019s hard to give that up, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t,\u201d he said, reaching for her.</p><p>\u201cI want to hear that you\u2019re in love with me, too. I want a true partner and family, Luke. A child, at least one child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShelby, honey, you have plans! School, travel, a career as a saver of lives\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly right, and you know what? We girls don\u2019t have to choose between education, careers and family anymore. It\u2019s a brave new world, Luke. I can travel, get an education, train for an exciting career and have a solid relationship, too. Just like the boys do. Look at Mel. Look at Brie.\u201d</p><p>He hung his head, looking down.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say it. You were clear from the beginning\u2014that just isn\u2019t going to happen with you. So I\u2019m taking off. I came to say goodbye. I\u2019m leaving in two days for Maui. That vacation I\u2019ve been kicking around. I\u2019m packing up the car, driving to San Francisco and picking up a flight from there. Then I\u2019ll go back to San Francisco and look around for an apartment. Maybe get a part-time job and audit some classes while I wait. San Francisco State is going to take me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShelby,\u201d he said, stepping toward her. He reached for her hand and when she didn\u2019t meet him halfway, he pulled her hand out of her pocket and drew her toward him. \u201cI\u2019m freezing. Come inside. Tell me about your plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want this to be quick. I want you to remember me strong, sure of myself. You\u2019re probably better at saying goodbye than I am. I don\u2019t want to get all worked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never say goodbye,\u201d he said. He pulled her into the house and kicked the door closed behind her. He faced her and held both her upper arms in his hands. \u201cIsn\u2019t this kind of sudden?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh\u2014I\u2019ve known for a while this was coming. This was the best I could do. But I wanted to tell you a couple of things. It just matters to me that you know.... I don\u2019t have any regrets,\u201d she said. \u201cI know I didn\u2019t give you much of a choice\u2014I was so determined that you were going to be the one, my first man, my first love. And I was mostly right\u2014you made everything perfect. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll live a day without remembering, without feeling your arms, your lips... Thank you, Luke. For treating me like you loved me. Every time you touched me, I believed you loved me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying? That you\u2019re not coming back? Ever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be back to visit the family, but not until I think I can do that without getting in your space. I mean, when I move on, you move on. I understand that. There will be another girl\u2019s shampoo in your shower before I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t let just anyone keep shampoo in my shower,\u201d he said. He pulled her close, put his arms around her. \u201cShelby, take off your coat. Stay with me a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, I\u2019m afraid if I stay even five minutes longer than I have to, I\u2019ll never have the courage to go.\u201d She pulled back and looked up at him. \u201cI knew you were completely honest with me, Luke. I understood\u2014you just like things free and easy, you don\u2019t want all the complications that go with taking on a commitment to a woman. You don\u2019t want a family. I guess not everyone does. I knew it, but inside there was a tiny little voice that kept saying, but he loves me enough for that to change. I thought maybe you could be that guy\u2014the guy who\u2019d say the perfect thing and keep me forever....\u201d</p> <p>He ran a hand through her hair. \u201cShelby, honey, I told you I was a bad choice if you were looking for those things. I\u2019d make the promises if I could keep them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you make them and keep them. You do it all the time. You promised me you\u2019d never let yourself be tied down to a woman, and you meant it. I thought the right woman might change that, but...I realized I was kidding myself when you told me what you\u2019d done for Art. You not only took him on and cared for him, but made a commitment to him, to be sure he was taken care of forever. That\u2019s when I knew for sure\u2014it wasn\u2019t really commitment that has you running scared. It\u2019s making a life with me, that\u2019s what you can\u2019t do. Something must be missing. I\u2019m just not enough for you to take that kind of risk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing was missing,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing. But I\u2019m not a good bet and you have things to do. I saw you out there at the accident\u2014you were born to help people. You have to go after that life, and you should see more of the world than you have. Shelby, the possibilities for you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what it was, we\u2019d talk about how to make all that happen. Together. There are a million ways to work this out, you and me. Except...there really isn\u2019t a you and me. Not like I hoped there could be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019re ready for something like that, but you\u2019re not. You were just born, baby. You have to get out of the nest now. Fly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Luke, I\u2019m not a newborn. I\u2019ve been places that I pray, by the grace of God, you never go.... When I thought about it\u2014you\u2019ve made many commitments, not the least of which was the army. Brothers, business partners, friends. But Art was the one that made me really sit up and take notice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cArt\u2019s different, Shelby. He has nowhere else to go. And if I couldn\u2019t take care of him, I could find him a safe place. It\u2019s not the same, you have to know that. And the army? Aw, hell, Shelby\u2014they had me, I didn\u2019t have them. It\u2019s service or AWOL.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBull. Everyone gets a discharge date, unless they re-up. You were committed. And I\u2019m proud of you for that, I\u2019m proud of you for everything, especially for Art. If I don\u2019t go soon, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll stay here forever without ever hearing you say the things I need to hear. And that, more than anything, will break my heart.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, his eyes pained, but he didn\u2019t let go of her. \u201cI knew in the end I\u2019d hurt you, and I never wanted to hurt you. Shelby, I want everything for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you. I absolutely do. You couldn\u2019t have loved me the way you did if you didn\u2019t care, if you weren\u2019t sincere. If I\u2019m hurt, it\u2019s just because you\u2019re so damn hard to give up. And I\u2019m so damn in love with you.\u201d A tear ran down her cheek. She pulled away from him. \u201cBe safe, Luke. I know I\u2019ll think about you all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Art? Aren\u2019t you going to tell Art where you\u2019re going? What you\u2019re going to do?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cGod, I can\u2019t,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI\u2019ll fall apart. Luke, please, tell him for me. Tell him it was sudden and I\u2019ll write to him. Please?\u201d She was edging away from him and he abruptly pulled her back. He held her tight and covered her mouth in a searing and desperate kiss. In spite of herself, she returned the embrace and opened her lips to him, but a whimper escaped her. While he kissed her, Luke could taste her tears. When he released her lips, she dropped her head against his chest and for just a moment, she cried. It was very brief; her struggle was courageous. She pulled away from him and in a whisper said, \u201cGoodbye, Luke. You were everything. You were all I needed. I\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t enough for you. Maybe someday you\u2019ll meet someone who is.\u201d</p><p>When she went out the door, he stood there for a long time. He heard her Jeep start, saw the headlights strafe the windows as she backed away, listened while the engine noise grew more faint and finally disappeared. And still he stood there. Then he hung his head.</p><p>Despite the wicked chill in the air, a few people from Virgin River braved the cold to gather together for dinner at Jack\u2019s. Vanessa and Paul took Abby with them and while they were there, Mel and Cameron came over from the clinic. Mike V. stopped by for a beer before heading home where, he said, their baby daughter would no doubt be screaming like a banshee. Walt passed through only long enough to pick up some takeout for an evening with Muriel. Vanessa was pleased to notice that Cameron took a chair beside Abby and was visiting with her. For a second there she had a hopeful thought\u2014that maybe those two could\u2014</p> <p>But then she noticed something in the way he seemed to gaze into her eyes and she seemed to lower her lids almost shyly. Abby was not shy. Sure, she was vulnerable right now and probably not in the best shape to receive the attentions of a single man, but... Cameron leaned toward her to say something quietly and Abby smiled and nodded. And then he touched her thigh under the table, giving her a soft and reassuring pat that turned into a brief caress. And Vanessa had to concentrate not to stare.</p><p>No one stayed late, the weather was just too frigid. No one seemed to notice that Vanni was unusually quite. Once they were home, Vanni settled the baby for the night and Paul fell asleep, sitting up in bed with a book in his lap. She crept out of her room. Abby was still in the living room, curled up on the couch in front of the fire with a throw around her shoulders.</p><p>Vanni went to the couch and lifted a corner of the throw, snuggling close.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Abby asked. \u201cCouldn\u2019t sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ve been thinking...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s got you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMath.\u201d</p><p>Abby laughed. \u201cWell, I can\u2019t help you there. I was never good at math.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou left Nikki and Joe\u2019s wedding reception. We knew you were depressed, we all knew you and Ross were on the skids even though you wouldn\u2019t talk about it. We thought you went to your room to suffer in silence and even talked about trying to draw you out, but in the end decided sometimes a girl wants to be alone, to lick her wounds, think, maybe even cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now I\u2019m thinking, what are the chances you met someone that night, in Grants Pass? Someone so nice, so sweet. So sexy and handsome that you were tempted to actually pass some time with him. Someone I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanni...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good man, Abby. A very good man. He\u2019s come to help our town. He courted me a little and when he realized I was in love with Paul, not only did he back away like a gentleman, he helped us\u2014more than once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanni, I don\u2019t really know him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I suggest you get to know him. Real soon. I could tell by the way you two looked at each other\u2014there\u2019s something happening there. You have his babies inside you, don\u2019t you?\u201d Abby looked down. \u201cWell, if, worst-case scenario, you can\u2019t fall in love with him, at least you can let him be a father to his children. He\u2019s not a slimeball like Ross\u2014he\u2019s decent. And I happen to know\u2014it would mean a lot to him.\u201d</p><p>There was a long period of silence. \u201cDo you think everyone knows?\u201d</p><p>Vanni was shaking her head. \u201cNo one knows you like I do. And remember, I know him, too. Lucky guess. Plus, I was in Grants Pass. Abby, you\u2019re going to have to deal with this. Does he know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t take him long to guess,\u201d Abby said. \u201cJust exactly what I was hoping to avoid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, kiddo, that ship has sailed. How in the world did this happen?\u201d</p><p>Abby shrugged. \u201cHe was alone in the bar. So was I. We spent a couple of hours, just the two of us, talking. Laughing. And my head was so screwed up, I let myself be coerced upstairs to his room. I never meant that to happen. It was a mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about that. Sounds like it could have been fate. So, what\u2019s the plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t think it will raise many eyebrows if we become friends, get to know each other a little bit. But, Vanni, you have to understand something\u2014 I\u2019m not diving headlong into another relationship with someone I don\u2019t know very well. It\u2019s going to take time and it may not end up being the fairy tale you\u2019d like it to be. We were two disappointed, needy people that night. That\u2019s all. In a practical relationship, I\u2019m not sure we have that much in common.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, I can think of a couple of things.\u201d</p><p>When Walt got to Muriel\u2019s house, the dogs rushed to him, but Muriel didn\u2019t. He found her sitting at her kitchen table with a notepad and glass of wine. He hefted his sack. \u201cI brought you meat loaf and garlic mashed from Jack\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him across the cheerful kitchen and said, \u201cI\u2019m doing it, Walt. I\u2019m going back to L.A. to work.\u201d</p><p>When he thought about it, he\u2019d expected this. She was enchanted with the script from the moment she read it. And he knew she wouldn\u2019t sell out, so it must have come together in a way she thought was worth her time and effort. He put the sack on the counter and went to the cupboard and got down a glass and that special bottle of Pinch she reserved for special occasions, pouring himself a drink. Then he sat at the table across from her. \u201cTell me about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI probably should have talked to you about it sooner, when it started to look like it was going to work to my advantage. But I try not to get stupidly optimistic about possible deals. For just about the first time, it turned out I was the last holdout. The actress waiting in the wings for the part was Diane Keaton. It\u2019s a good part, Walt. A good opportunity.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you seem happy?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t how I thought I\u2019d spend the next six months. It\u2019s going to be a lot of hard work. And later, when the film is out, there will be promotion\u2014that\u2019s also a lot of hard work. And none of it can be done here. I\u2019ll be in L.A. for some of it and on location in Montana in spring and early summer.\u201d</p><p>He took a bolstering drink and then reached for her hand. \u201cWe\u2019ve been over this, Muriel. If you feel strongly about doing the film, I\u2019m behind you. If you have worries, I don\u2019t want one of them to be me.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled a small smile. \u201cI have to leave tomorrow to begin rehearsing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow?\u201d he asked, shocked. \u201cMy God! Should you be packing?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo need. I just have to get together my cosmetics. I can take the dogs with me\u2014I had them put it in my contract that I\u2019ll have help with pet care. They\u2019ll send someone to stay in the guesthouse and take care of the horses. And\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you need clothes?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI have a place in Los Angeles. A small but very nice condo. I left behind a full closet\u2014those clothes wouldn\u2019t work for me here and the clothes I wear around here won\u2019t work for me there. I figured in a year or so I\u2019d empty the place out and either rent or sell it, but now it\u2019ll come in handy. I\u2019ve let a couple of friends use the place for visiting relatives, so it hasn\u2019t gone to waste.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou never even mentioned it,\u201d he said, and for a moment he was grateful for that. If he\u2019d thought all along that she still had another home, he might not have been so optimistic about their chances.</p><p>\u201cReally, I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever use it unless I was in L.A. visiting or something...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuriel, are the dogs going to be a problem while you\u2019re making this movie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cI\u2019ll have some long hours, but the studio will make sure there\u2019s someone assigned to walking them, feeding them, all that. I just won\u2019t get to run Luce or train Buff like I\u2019d planned to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me keep them for you. Let me take care of the horses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalt, I can\u2019t ask you to\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t ask, Muriel. Really, it\u2019s selfish. I don\u2019t want to think of someone else living in that bunkhouse or the dogs pooping on concrete somewhere when I can run them along the river. Besides a little babysitting, what do I have to do? Shelby\u2019s gone, Vanni and Paul have their own place, I take care of horses every day anyway...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of bother, Walt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI offered. No strings,\u201d he added. \u201cI didn\u2019t offer so that you\u2019d feel obligated to me in any way. I mean, who knows? Jack Whatshisname might turn out to be just what you\u2019ve always dreamt of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou jealous of him already?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re goddamn right,\u201d he said, leaning back in his chair, drawing those fierce eyebrows together. \u201cHe\u2019s going to spend the next six months with you and I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he doesn\u2019t stand a chance,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>He thought, this must be how Peg felt when he was leaving for a long remote tour, as though there was a chance he wouldn\u2019t come back to her. \u201cI\u2019ve been down this road,\u201d he told Muriel. \u201cSeparations for work. It\u2019s not easy, but it\u2019s highly survivable. Do you need a ride to the airport?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be nice. It\u2019s just to Garberville.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPicking up a charter?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThey\u2019re sending a jet.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows shot up. \u201cI haven\u2019t been down that road,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cYou want meat loaf? Or do you want to go upstairs, let me peel your clothes off and tell you goodbye properly?\u201d</p><p>She grinned at him. \u201cLet\u2019s think about meat loaf for breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d he said, standing. He reached for her hand. \u201cCome on, honey. This is my last chance to pamper you before your Oscar. What time does your flight leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I get there.\u201d</p><p>The next morning, Walt drove her to the Garberville airport where there was a Lear waiting. The pilot and cabin steward, nicely uniformed, were waiting at the bottom of the airstairs and they fussed over her very impressively. She had only one small bag and traveled in her jeans and boots, leather jacket and cowboy hat. She kept them waiting while she gave Walt a long, deep kiss goodbye. \u201cIf there\u2019s a break in the filming, I\u2019ll be up for a visit. And I\u2019ll call you when I get there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuriel, stop being reluctant and sad. You want this and I want it for you. You\u2019re good, that\u2019s why you\u2019re getting this chance. Knock \u2019em dead. And if Jack Whatshisname makes a play for you, tell him to fuck off. You have a boyfriend already.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll be sure to tell him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m a good shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said. \u201cThanks for taking on the animals. They mean a lot to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d he said.</p><p>He stood there in the blistering cold until her private jet took her away. He watched it until it was out of sight. All he could think was, what if she doesn\u2019t come back? What if she really does get that Oscar and is lured into one more and one more and one more? A private jet came for her and she didn\u2019t even have to pack. And having her own jet didn\u2019t make her the least intimidated or uncomfortable. This was Muriel\u2019s real life.</p><p>What the hell was I thinking I could mean to her?</p><p>What if she\u2019s all done being mine?</p><p>Mel heard a truck pull up in front of the clinic and thought it must be Bruce bringing mail and asking after specimens to be delivered to Valley Hospital. She walked out onto the porch, but didn\u2019t recognize the truck. She frowned as a woman got out of the passenger side. This was an attractive woman in her early thirties\u2014trim, brown hair, pink cheeks. She looked up at Mel and smiled somewhat shyly. \u201cHi,\u201d she said.</p><p>Mel frowned, then returned the smile. \u201cHi. How can I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you already have.\u201d She took two steps up onto the porch. She wore light makeup, slim jeans, a long-sleeved turtleneck shirt and down vest.</p><p>And then it dawned on her. Cheryl Chreighton! Her transformation was nothing short of astonishing. In just a few months\u2019 time her complexion had pinked up, her eyes were clear, she\u2019d dropped about twenty-five pounds\u2014probably most of it the edema that she carried from drinking\u2014and she was not just clean, but actually groomed and styled. Someone had cut her hair and showed her how to fix it. She wore women\u2019s clothes and a very happy smile. \u201cOh, dear God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Cheryl said. \u201cDear God and you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at you,\u201d Mel said in a breath.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Cheryl said solemnly. \u201cThis is because of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s you,\u201d Mel stressed. \u201cAll I did was make a few phone calls. You did the work. Have you come home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Cheryl said with a laugh, shaking her head. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a good place for me. I have a job and a place with some roommates. Not exactly a group home, but close\u2014we\u2019re in recovery. Not much of a job, but I don\u2019t need much of one right now.\u201d Cheryl swallowed and looked down. \u201cI doubt I\u2019ll ever come back here,\u201d she said. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any meetings here or anything.\u201d She looked up bravely and gave a shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d be happy in a place where I used to be the town drunk. Not just an average town drunk, a below-average town drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wouldn\u2019t matter, you know that. But the meetings\u2014you need the meetings. Recovery without aftercare is like major surgery without stitches.\u201d</p><p>Cheryl chuckled. \u201cYeah, you got that right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long has it been?\u201d Mel asked.</p><p>\u201cA hundred and twenty-seven days. I don\u2019t think we can count the day you took me. I was blitzed. I don\u2019t see a time I\u2019ll be skipping those meetings, even though I really don\u2019t want a drink today.... Mrs. Sheridan, what I have right now, I don\u2019t want to give it up. I\u2019m at meetings all the time, sometimes twice a day. If it\u2019s forever, that\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>Mel almost said, \u201cCall me Mel,\u201d but caught herself. This was Cheryl\u2019s show; she could do anything she wanted. \u201cGood for you,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cWonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to see my parents. I haven\u2019t seen them since I left here that day with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be so happy to see you....\u201d</p><p>Cheryl laughed. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. My mother thought the whole rehab thing was crazy and my dad thought we were doing pretty good the way he doled out the booze on his terms so he thought he had it under control. That might explain a few things. And they\u2019re not well, either of them. I need to see them, but I can\u2019t stay here. I wouldn\u2019t come alone, though. My sponsor is with me.\u201d</p><p>Mel leaned down a bit to peer into the truck. A silver-haired woman sat behind the wheel and gave Mel a brief wave and she thought, ah good. A mature woman, hopefully with years of sobriety under her belt. That would give Cheryl a good shot at success.</p><p>\u201cAnd there are amends,\u201d Cheryl said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I can cover the whole town, but I wanted to catch you and Doc, maybe Jack...\u201d</p><p>Mel was temporarily shocked and for the first time realized she\u2019d come onto the porch without a coat. She shivered. Tears gathered. \u201cCheryl, my God, I\u2019m so sorry. Someone should\u2019ve gotten word to you. I\u2019m surprised your parents didn\u2019t\u2014 Doc passed away suddenly last October. We don\u2019t know why. His heart maybe. Or a fatal stroke. There was no autopsy....\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoc? Gone?\u201d Cheryl asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Mel said. Mel blinked and a tear escaped. \u201cHe was so happy you decided on treatment. He\u2019d be so proud of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d she said. \u201cIsn\u2019t it amazing how fast things can just shift? He was always kind to me....\u201d Cheryl shook herself. \u201cWell. I can\u2019t remember if I ever did anything terrible to you that I should make amends for, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t,\u201d Mel said quickly, shaking her head. \u201cIn fact, you were nice to me. You offered to help me with babysitting a long time ago. You cleaned out that horrible cabin Hope McCrea gave me as my free housing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember about babysitting,\u201d Cheryl said.</p><p>\u201cTrust me. You were nice to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for that,\u201d Cheryl said. \u201cBut Jack\u2014I know I was a thorn in his butt. I wonder if I should go see him, tell him I\u2019m sorry about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should definitely see him, though I already know he\u2019s not holding any grudge. But it would make Jack so happy to see you sober and well. It would be a good thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure, Cheryl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s amends to you, too\u2014I made a pass at Jack. I mean, I want to tell him it was just booze. I\u2019m not really insane.\u201d Then she smiled. \u201cWell, no more than the average drunk.\u201d</p><p>Mel let go a small laugh. \u201cThat must have happened way before I found him\u2014you have no amends to make to me. And I\u2019ll bet Jack understands. Still, you can\u2019t imagine how happy it would make him to know you\u2019re in recovery. Cheryl\u2014I never told him I took you to a treatment facility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t?\u201d she asked, shocked. \u201cI thought the whole town knew!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot from me or...Doc. We don\u2019t talk about clinic business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. I didn\u2019t expect that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, now that you know, you can expect it. In fact, I never heard any talk around town. After all, it wasn\u2019t the first time you slipped away for a while.\u201d She grinned.</p><p>There was a quiet moment between them as they just looked into each other\u2019s eyes. Then Cheryl said, \u201cThank you, Mrs. Sheridan. It was a real good thing you did for me.\u201d</p><p>Mel felt her gut clench and tears threaten to flow. Those had been Doc\u2019s exact words! How he would have enjoyed seeing her like this, so different, so attractive and talking so smart. Mel liked to think maybe Doc did see. \u201cI\u2019m so glad it worked out, I\u2019m proud of you. Go. See Jack and your folks. Have a nice visit. Will you stop by sometimes? When you visit your parents? Tell us how you are?\u201d</p> <p>Cheryl nodded. \u201cSure. If you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want,\u201d Mel said. \u201cThat would be nice.\u201d</p><p>When Mel went back inside the clinic, she went to Doc\u2019s old office, which she now shared with Cam. There were no patients, the kids were napping, Cam was off on errands. She was alone\u2014free and clear. She put her head down on her arms and cried. Cried happy tears for Cheryl and special tears for missing Doc, knowing what it would mean to him to see one of his own coming out of such a dark time. God, to look at the woman was inspiring! To listen to her speak, so astounding! She was a whole new person. And she was young yet; she had a chance for a full and productive life.</p><p>Mel was consumed for at least a half hour. Then she heard the sound of a vehicle and thinking, again, it might be Bruce with mail, she wiped her eyes and walked out on the porch. This time it was Bruce. He handed her a packet of mail. \u201cAny specimens?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNot today,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cGood. I get off early.\u201d</p><p>As he jumped back in his truck, she looked at the front porch of Jack\u2019s bar. He walked outside with an arm draped over Cheryl\u2019s shoulders. They stopped, hugged, and Cheryl bounced down the steps to the waiting truck. The truck backed away.</p><p>Jack stood on his porch, looking at his wife. Even from across the street she could see the tenderness in his smile, the pride and gratitude. Cheryl had told him everything. He lifted his hand to Mel. And she lifted hers.</p><p>Nineteen</p><p>Aiden Riordan pulled up to Luke\u2019s cabin and blew the horn before getting out of his car. Luke came out with a perplexed look on his haggard face.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t answered the phone in ten days!\u201d he said angrily. \u201cYou know, answering machines work just fine out here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhone\u2019s out,\u201d Luke said, turning to go back inside.</p><p>Aiden rolled his eyes, shook his head and followed. He walked into the house behind Luke and pulled off his leather gloves as he looked around. Luke sat on the sectional, staring at him from beneath angry, hooded brows. \u201cNice,\u201d Aiden said. Then he walked over to the kitchen phone, looked at it and plugged it in.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be real sorry you did that,\u201d Luke said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Getting a lot of calls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would call them attempts at calls. I don\u2019t want to talk. That includes you, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, you\u2019re stuck with me,\u201d Aiden said. He went to the refrigerator and grabbed a bottled beer, popped the cap and went to the living room. He sat and without even bothering to take his jacket off, he said, \u201cSo. She left you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m talking about the perfect nymphet, Shelby. She left you and you\u2019re going down the shitter.\u201d He took a drink of his beer.</p><p>Luke silently and meanly glared at his brother.</p><p>\u201cShe left you, you\u2019re miserable and completely fucked up. I had to come all the way up here to make sure your ten-day-old dead body wasn\u2019t in this house and you\u2019re not being at all cooperative or hospitable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one asked you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Jesus, I know that! God forbid the firstborn ever show weakness or ask for anything. You\u2019re the steel man, right? Give me a break, Luke. Look at you. You augured in. Crashed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been working,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBullshit. The work\u2019s done. Tell me what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing happened,\u201d Luke said. \u201cIt\u2019s been kind of quiet around here. I didn\u2019t feel like talking to anyone. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Aiden looked down and shook his head with silent laughter. \u201cBrother, you give me no credit. You think I took emergency leave to come up here and save your life without knowing anything? I called that bar\u2014that sweet little bar you like so much? Where they haven\u2019t seen you in a long time? I talked to Jack a while, got Walt Booth\u2019s number and talked to him, too. Here\u2019s what happened\u2014Shelby went to Maui for a warm, sunny vacation before heading to San Francisco to get an apartment for school that\u2019s not starting for months. She got out of town. Since we had this talk once already, I can guess why. You pushed her away. You wouldn\u2019t tell her how you feel because you think it\u2019s a mistake for her. And you\u2019re still scared every woman you meet is going to do you dirty. You\u2019re still making decisions for other people without getting their opinion. Now she thinks you don\u2019t care about her and so she took you up on the challenge and she left. Got as far away as she could. And now you\u2019re in the shitter!\u201d</p><p>Luke glared at Aiden for a moment before he said, \u201cI\u2019m going to fucking kill you.\u201d</p><p>Aiden sat back in the chair and grinned. He took a slug of his beer. \u201cOh yeah? And why is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou called the general? About me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup. And the bartender. But I got the call from Sean who got the call from Mom and you should just be glad Paddy and Colin aren\u2019t stateside or they\u2019d be in it. Now, why don\u2019t you just answer the fucking phone and tell people you\u2019re busy and can\u2019t talk? What the hell are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave my life?\u201d Luke asked. \u201cEmergency leave? Save my life? What the hell are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Aiden sat forward and grew serious. \u201cLook, we\u2019ve been here before. We were all young, true, and the circumstances were entirely different, but try to imagine what it\u2019s like to see your big brother\u2014the guy you most admire in the world\u2014hit the skids and just about sink out of sight. Scared the shit out of everyone. That\u2019s not going to happen again. No one is going to let it happen again.\u201d</p><p>Luke took a breath. \u201cLook, it\u2019s not a big deal. Shelby was just following through with her plans. She wants to travel, go to school. I\u2019m adjusting. Gimme a week. It\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Aiden stared at him for a second. \u201cAw, bullshit,\u201d he said.</p><p>Before Luke could respond, the phone rang.</p><p>\u201cSee? Goddamnit! Why\u2019d you plug that thing in?\u201d Luke roared.</p><p>Aiden went to the phone. He said hello. \u201cYes, Mom, I\u2019m here\u2014he\u2019s fine. Yes, fine. I took his pulse, he\u2019s alive, he\u2019ll be fine. Yes, Mom. Yes, Mom. Mom! I just got here! Would you let me\u2014 Yes, Mom. Goodbye. I love you, too.\u201d Before he could get back to his chair, it rang again and Luke groaned very loudly. Aiden picked it up and said hello. \u201cJesus, I just got here! Will you give me ten minutes to find out what the hell\u2019s going on? Yeah, he\u2019s fine! I\u2019ll call you back. Now leave us alone!\u201d</p><p>Aiden went back to his chair, his beer.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d Luke said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you obviously unplugged the phone after all the calls started. You never bothered to tell anyone you were fine. What if Shelby called to say she\u2019d thought it over and decided to sit it out here until her classes started? What\u2019s the deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t going to call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if she did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wouldn\u2019t be good for her.\u201d</p><p>Aiden was stunned silent for a minute. His mind was whirring. Then he was slowly overcome by a sly grin. \u201cOh man,\u201d he said. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be able to keep yourself from answering the phone if it rang, hoping it could be her, so you unplugged it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re out of your mind...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d rather have her think you weren\u2019t here. That a day or a week after she left you, you got it together and you were out looking for girls. Jesus, Luke.\u201d He laughed. \u201cWhat if she wanted some more time with you? Huh? What if she wanted to give you some more time with her to work out your issues?\u201d</p><p>Luke shook his head helplessly. He got up from the sectional and went to the kitchen to get a beer. He went back to the living room. \u201cThat would be a bad decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, now we\u2019re on the same page. You\u2019re looking out for her. You going to come clean with me, or do we have to have six more beers to get there? Because I don\u2019t drink a lot anymore. On call all the time, you know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I explained this,\u201d Luke said, sounding annoyed. \u201cShe\u2019s a beautiful young girl. She might be a chronological twenty-five, but subtract a few years of her being tied to an invalid. She would be carded in most bars. I was almost her first flirt! She should do things! Experience things! She\u2019s been patient and dedicated a long time\u2014she has to get out there and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd not take a chance on you and then realize in a couple years that she was hasty,\u201d Aiden supplied.</p><p>\u201cAw, what the hell,\u201d Luke said, standing up and running a hand across the back of his neck. \u201cShe\u2019s not ready to make that kind of choice. She might think she is, but she\u2019s not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you weren\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s too young!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you were?\u201d</p><p>Luke didn\u2019t respond. He turned his back on his brother.</p><p>Aiden stood up and approached Luke\u2019s back. He put a hand on his shoulder and squeezed. \u201cYou weren\u2019t too young when you married Felicia. You weren\u2019t too naive or inexperienced when you were twenty-five. You had it all\u2014you were sharp and loyal and you knew how you felt. You had enough passion and commitment to never change your mind. You got screwed up by someone who wasn\u2019t your match. I\u2019m sorry, buddy, but it wasn\u2019t your fault. Jesus, will you ever let yourself off the hook for that? You didn\u2019t cheat on her! She went out on you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d he said. Then he laughed ruefully and shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s what she said to me....\u201d</p><p>\u201cFelicia?\u201d</p><p>Luke turned around. \u201cShelby. She said she knew she wasn\u2019t enough....\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Christ,\u201d Aiden said in a breath. He thought for a second and said, \u201cOkay, look, let\u2019s not just get tanked and whimper. Let\u2019s go out, get a decent meal, maybe have a conversation that doesn\u2019t include yelling, and when I\u2019m satisfied you\u2019re all right and won\u2019t unplug your phone anymore, I\u2019ll get out of your hair.\u201d</p><p>Luke answered with a weak nod.</p><p>\u201cWant to go to that bar you like so much?\u201d Aiden asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said immediately. \u201cI need a little more time on that. Let\u2019s go over to Fortuna. There\u2019s a fish place...\u201d</p><p>Aiden drove Luke to the next big town over and they ate at a nice little restaurant near a wide river. They ordered the same thing, which happened a lot in their family. There were things Aiden wanted to understand, but knowing Luke it wouldn\u2019t work to just come out and ask him. So Aiden got him talking about the town, the people, the cabins and what he thought he\u2019d end up doing with the property.</p><p>The mission when he bought the house and cabins was to turn them for a profit as soon as it was reasonable to do so. Now Luke was thinking about taking a year to see what booking them as vacation rentals looked like. There wasn\u2019t a motel or bed-and-breakfast in Virgin River and it could be a highly profitable venture and not too much to manage. If it worked itself into a decent income, he might try to buy out Sean and run it as the sole owner. It would be the most settled Luke had been in more than twenty years. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Luke was ready to put down roots. He was just scared to death to ask anyone like Shelby to take that on. Because she might change her mind. And that would kill him.</p><p>So then Aiden got a little brazen and said, \u201cThere must have been something about this Shelby that really tripped you up. It\u2019s not like you to get mixed up with some local girl, especially one with a general for an uncle.\u201d</p><p>Luke chuckled. \u201cHer looks. The first day I passed through town, I ran into her twice. I thought she was about eighteen and, brother, I knew better.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe was the only pretty girl in three counties?\u201d Aiden asked.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t tell you,\u201d Luke said. \u201cI think I hit my head or something. I had a bad case of tunnel vision. I tried like hell to talk myself out of it, but it wasn\u2019t long before all I could do was finish what I\u2019d started. You\u2019ve been there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeen there,\u201d Aiden agreed. After all, he\u2019d married a woman because of tunnel vision. \u201cAnd that\u2019s when you started to lose interest?\u201d</p><p>He was quiet for a second. \u201cYou don\u2019t lose interest in someone like Shelby. No matter how hard you try.\u201d</p><p>Aiden took a chance. \u201cBeen a while since you felt something like that, I guess.\u201d</p> <p>Luke leveled his gaze across the table at Aiden. \u201cI know what you\u2019re doing. I don\u2019t want to spend a lot of time talking about this. I don\u2019t need the aggravation. What I need is time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fell hard,\u201d Aiden said.</p><p>\u201cIt happens. Now, that\u2019s enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to be sure you\u2019re going to be able to move on without...\u201d His voice trailed off.</p><p>\u201cWithout going completely crazy? Listen, I think I learned a few things, Aiden. This is as bad as it\u2019s going to get. Until it gets better. Leave it alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn shame you couldn\u2019t just go with it, Luke. There\u2019s at least a fifty-percent chance you\u2019re all wrong about her, about yourself, about the way the whole thing could turn out. You might\u2019ve been happy every day of your stupid life, and now you\u2019re just working on getting over her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s the thing, Aiden. Fifty-percent chance one of us is right. We just don\u2019t know which one.\u201d</p><p>After breakfast the next morning, Aiden threw his duffel in his car, shook his brother\u2019s hand and said, \u201cGo after her, Luke. Tell her the truth, that it scares you to death but you want her.\u201d</p><p>Luke just smiled. \u201cThanks for coming, Aiden. I know you only want to help. Drive carefully.\u201d</p><p>It was almost time for Shelby to leave Maui, but she wasn\u2019t sure if she was ready and was considering another week before embarking on San Francisco. She didn\u2019t know if the rest and sunshine was helping or if it would be better to take on a new challenge.</p><p>She\u2019d packed everything at her uncle\u2019s, loaded the Jeep and drove to San Francisco to fly to Hawaii so she wouldn\u2019t have go back to Virgin River to pick up her car, her things. Her Jeep was in the long-term lot at the airport, waiting for her next step toward that new life, the one that didn\u2019t interest her at all. The tall trees and mountains called her and the noisy din of the city didn\u2019t sound appealing. Nothing could be as good as the quiet, the clear sky, the natural beauty that had surrounded her. She missed the horses. She missed so much...</p><p>She had chosen her vacation accommodations carefully\u2014a hotel on the beach with a decent restaurant. She thought she\u2019d do a little sightseeing around the island, but hadn\u2019t. Reading a lot was part of her plan, but for the first time in her memory, her mind wandered too much to escape into good fiction. Even when her mother had been at her worst, she had been able to read; it had brought her great comfort to fall into a good story. The hotel restaurant was exceptional, but she still yearned for some of Preacher\u2019s food and a blazing hearth, the laughter of friends, the touch of a lover\u2019s hand under the table. Except for breakfast, most of her meals were delivered to her by room service. She was very alone, hidden behind her dark glasses, which was the way she wanted it.</p><p>Every day she walked along the beach as far as she could go, sometimes for a couple of hours. She\u2019d lounge on a chaise on the beach and soak up the sun, sometimes relax under a cabana, her eyes closed so she looked as if she was napping. Resting. But she was bleeding inside. If anyone looked closely, they\u2019d catch the occasional tear rolling into the hair at her temples. The crying\u2014it was so much more than she\u2019d imagined it could be. She was so busy holding it together while she was around her uncle and cousin, she\u2019d had no idea how much emotion she\u2019d been struggling with. The crying started as soon as the plane\u2019s landing gear came up and in spite of her best efforts, she sobbed half the way to Hawaii. Luck was on her side and she was seated next to a kindhearted older woman who put an arm around her and said, \u201cOh, darling, there\u2019s no mistaking a broken heart.\u201d</p><p>The best fiction in the history of the world had not adequately conveyed just how much a broken heart could hurt or how much crying was involved. It was a kind of death made worse by the fact that there hadn\u2019t been a death at all, unless you accounted for the demise of perfect happiness.</p> <p>\u201cBeautiful day,\u201d a man\u2019s voice said.</p><p>She turned her head to see him sitting on the chaise right beside her. There were dozens of available chairs on the beach and around the pool and yet he had to choose this one. \u201cBeautiful,\u201d she said quietly, turning her head back, trying to ignore him.</p><p>\u201cI hear it rains here all the time. Have you seen much rain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she said. \u201cI was napping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink you\u2019ll be done napping by dinnertime? I\u2019d love to take you to dinner.\u201d</p><p>She turned her head, lifted her glasses and said, \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d Again she turned away.</p><p>\u201cThen maybe I could buy you a drink? A mai tai or Bloody Mary?\u201d</p><p>Without looking at him she said, \u201cDo I have to move? Or will you?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cNothing shy about that, Shelby.\u201d</p><p>She jumped in surprise, sitting up a little. \u201cDid someone tell you my name?\u201d she said, stricken. The last thing she needed right now was to feel at some kind of risk. She was alone here, depending on the hotel staff to be sure she\u2019d be completely safe.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI already knew your name. I asked where I could find you. They\u2019re very protective here, but when I described you, the towel kid knew where you might be.\u201d</p><p>She sat up, her mouth open.</p><p>He put out a hand. \u201cAiden Riordan,\u201d he said. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>Stunned speechless, she slowly put out her hand. He was a nice-looking man, but didn\u2019t resemble either Sean or Luke. He was dark-haired with heavy black brows, green eyes like his mother\u2019s and a very pleasant smile. \u201cThe doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOB-GYN, in fact. Nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat...? What in the world are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He gave a slight shrug. \u201cI thought someone ought to explain Luke, if that\u2019s possible.\u201d</p><p>Still in something of a state of shock, she sat sideways on the chaise, facing him, her feet in the sand. \u201cDid he send you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d Aiden laughed. \u201cIn fact, when he finds out, it\u2019s gonna be ugly. And maybe this was just a waste of my time, but I have a feeling there are some important things you don\u2019t know about him. On the other hand, I\u2019ll bet you know things about him I don\u2019t even want to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, this is...this is crazy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it. We have some loudmouths in the family, but it\u2019s kind of unusual for the boys to get into each other\u2019s business to this degree. Luke\u2019s kind of a special case, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, did he ever happen to mention he was married when he was much younger?\u201d Aiden asked.</p><p>It took her a moment to absorb that. \u201cWell, that would explain a few things,\u201d she finally said.</p><p>\u201cThe explanation gets more complicated. You\u2019ve probably heard a hundred nasty divorce tales, but this one combined a lot of events that worked out badly for Luke, and I think it\u2019s safe to say he\u2019s got some residual effect from it.\u201d</p><p>She looked down. \u201cI guess he didn\u2019t trust me that much,\u201d she said. \u201cOr he might\u2019ve told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has nothing to do with trust, Shelby. He was trying damn hard to keep from getting too close to you. It didn\u2019t quite work for him\u2014you should see him. He looks like a dead man, he\u2019s so miserable.\u201d</p><p>She scooted forward. \u201cWhen did you see him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple of days ago. And no, I didn\u2019t tell him I was going to try to find you. He wouldn\u2019t have endorsed this idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he okay?\u201d she asked, concerned.</p><p>\u201cNope. He\u2019s a mess. I guess he could recover,\u201d Aiden said. \u201cBut we have to talk, you and me, and then what will be, will be.</p><p>\u201cLuke got married when he was about twenty-four. He was a brand-new Black Hawk pilot and he married a girl he met in Alabama\u2014a real pretty Southern belle who turned his world upside down. Prettiest girl in the South, maybe. They dated, started making plans right away, had a wedding a few months later and he was the happiest man alive. Since he was the oldest, the rest of us were watching every move he made. We all wanted to be like Luke\u2014he was so sure of himself, so well equipped. All the boys wanted to go into the military, excel, get a million ribbons and promotions, marry the prettiest, sexiest girl on the map, grab on to that perfect life filled with challenge, adventure and passion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething went wrong, I gather,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOh, boy. Let\u2019s see, Colin was in the army, stationed on the other side of the country, I was in my last year of undergrad at the time, Sean was only nineteen and at the air force academy. Patrick was in high school. And Luke had a baby coming. First baby in the family, a son. First marriage for anyone. Luke was on top of the world, so happy, so in love, so excited about the baby, and then he was sent to Somalia, to Mogadishu. You ever see that movie, Black Hawk Down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I want to see it again....\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke got shot down over there, had some injuries, but he\u2019s the bravest man I\u2019ve ever known. That was a horrible experience for the army\u2014everything bad that could happen, happened. But he somehow got through it, performing heroically. He saved lives and was decorated for bravery. He got home as fast as he could because his son was about to be born. He was undoubtedly still battle scarred when he faced another battle. He wasn\u2019t home five minutes when his wife told him the baby\u2014which was conceived months before he left for Somalia\u2014wasn\u2019t his. She was doing some captain. One of Luke\u2019s superior officers, in fact. A man Luke went into war with, took orders from on occasion. And she was leaving Luke to go with the baby\u2019s father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod\u201d was all she could say.</p><p>\u201cIt humiliated him, this tough young soldier. He was your age at the time, Shelby\u2014twenty-five. There was a stir on the army post\u2014an officer messing with one of his men\u2019s wives. It wasn\u2019t only a divorce, it was just about front-page news, there were rumblings about pressing charges against the captain and Luke looked like a fool. He wasn\u2019t close to being done dealing with war. He had some issues from that at the same time. Broken heart, scandal, humiliation, disappointment, PTSD from battle, grief from watching comrades die.\u201d Aiden took a breath. \u201cHe was suicidal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke?\u201d she asked. \u201cThat\u2019s so difficult to imagine. Anger, I can see that. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t present itself in a typical way. He went down like a torpedo\u2014drank too much and drove, almost flew drunk, but someone pulled him off the flight line. He got in fights\u2014he seemed to go places where he could count on getting the hell beat out of him by at least several men. He picked the fights. He landed in the hospital a couple of times, injuries from fights, from a one-car accident. He probably wouldn\u2019t tell you this, but he told me. He just wanted to die.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She took a moment to absorb that, then said, \u201cNo wonder he won\u2019t have a close relationship...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are a lot of things that can screw a guy up, but Luke had a full menu. It wasn\u2019t just a bad marriage, Shelby, but everything, with a no-good cheating wife in the middle of it. It took a couple of years for him to get straightened out. He changed everything\u2014he stopped being calculating and just took too many chances, and he moved real fast. It turned out he couldn\u2019t give up women, but he seemed to give up attachments.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head. \u201cThat explains so much,\u201d she said. \u201cHe told me he didn\u2019t fall in love, went through women like a shark goes through scuba divers....\u201d</p> <p>Aiden smiled. \u201cThat sounds like Luke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI absolutely believed him,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought I could handle that. And then I stupidly thought something was different for him with me. That\u2019s where I screwed up.\u201d She took a breath. \u201cI must have blown his mind with that talk about children....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat talk was that?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI told him that I wanted a committed partner, at least one child. He said it was never going to happen with him, but I thought...\u201d She shrugged.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been saying that for quite a while. Maybe he believes it by now, but when he thought he had a child coming, I never saw a happier man. I\u2019m sorry he lost that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe made the excuse he was too old. I guess if he trusted me, he could have told me about his marriage, his reasons, given us a chance to work through it...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, he has a lot of denial about that. And, by the things he said, it sounded like he started out protecting himself, but later in your relationship, he was protecting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told me about your mother, about how dedicated you were for a few years, that you didn\u2019t have any real freedom... My condolences, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Maybe you\u2019ll understand this, since you\u2019re a doctor\u2014Luke sure doesn\u2019t get it. It wasn\u2019t a sacrifice. I wasn\u2019t held hostage. I was doing exactly what I wanted to do. I was very close to my mother. Helping someone close the door on this world and move on to the next\u2014it\u2019s very special. Intimate. I wasn\u2019t giving anything up\u2014I was getting something most people will never experience.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty remarkable take on things.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not remarkable,\u201d she said with a self-effacing smile. \u201cI was in a support group and learned an awful lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had some tough blows in the last year,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst, losing your mother. Then Luke.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes became moist, but she held steady. \u201cI don\u2019t regret what I gave either one, Aiden. I wouldn\u2019t change any of it. I would never have left my mom in someone else\u2019s care. I couldn\u2019t help falling in love with Luke.\u201d She gave a tremulous smile. \u201cI knew almost right away, he should be the one. My first love.\u201d</p><p>Aiden touched the hand that rested on her knee. \u201cYou never fell in love like that before, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never fell in love at all,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t very long after high school that my life got pretty isolated, and I wasn\u2019t one of the girls who got around a lot in high school. Luke was right about one thing\u2014I haven\u2019t lived much in those ways. I could\u2019ve stumbled onto some insensitive jerk, but it was Luke. He was so good to me, so tender, so wonderful. I can\u2019t regret that,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cMuch as it hurts now, I wouldn\u2019t take away one day with him. When he said he wanted to keep it just between us because it was so special, I guess I started to think his pattern of never getting involved could change...with me....\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust between you?\u201d Aiden asked in spite of himself.</p><p>\u201cThat he was the first one. Ever.\u201d She dropped her gaze. \u201cThe way I feel, he\u2019s probably going to be the only one. Ever.\u201d</p><p>Aiden was silent, looking at her sweet face, stunned. After what Luke had been through with his wife, he stumbled onto someone pure? Untouched? Oh, man, no wonder he was so screwed up. He must have glimpsed a kind of impossible dream\u2014a sweet and good woman who could be trusted, who would belong only to him. \u201cOh, Jesus,\u201d Aiden said, hanging his head. \u201cNo wonder this is so bad....\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShelby, the girl he married\u2014she was about the furthest thing from a virgin a guy can get. She was a sexy little flirt. She\u2019d been around, and apparently never stopped getting around. You gotta imagine\u2014Luke must have been thinking that if that one hurt, if something like that happened with you, it would kill him.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t believe he ever thought I\u2019d be like that....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s time for us to have that Bloody Mary,\u201d Aiden said. \u201cTake a walk on the beach. Then dinner.\u201d</p><p>When Aiden left in the morning to go to the airport, she hugged him goodbye like an old friend. They had talked the rest of the afternoon, through dinner, and then sat on the beach in the moonlight until very late. Most of that time was focused on Luke and her relationship with him, but also on the other brothers and Aiden\u2019s movement through medical school and practice, aboard ship and at naval bases and Camp Pendleton. And he learned about her childhood, her mother, the rest of her family, her love for the mountains and rivers, the horses, the quiet tranquility of Virgin River. They became good friends.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had the strangest thought,\u201d she told Aiden as he stood by his cab.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke\u2019s trying to rescue me by letting me go. He doesn\u2019t want me to sacrifice anything, to give up anything, to settle. But really, he\u2019s a mess. He\u2019s the one who needs to be rescued.\u201d</p><p>Aiden laughed. \u201cYeah, maybe. But since he\u2019ll never admit it, it\u2019s probably impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake care of him, Aiden,\u201d she said as he got in his cab at the hotel.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do what I can,\u201d he said. \u201cWill you go to San Francisco now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might take another week. Really, there\u2019s no big hurry for me to get there. I just felt like I had to be moving on, to be doing something. It\u2019s strange how long it takes to forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t forget, Shelby. You just adapt.\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly. \u201cThank you, Aiden. For coming all the way here just to talk to me. You don\u2019t realize how much it mattered, helped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so, Shelby. Luke\u2019s right about one thing\u2014you\u2019re special. Best of luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame to you.\u201d</p><p>Luke was sitting in front of his fireplace, feet up, listening to a CD while looking off at nothing in particular, when headlights dashed across his living-room window. It was wet out there; he wasn\u2019t expecting anyone. He looked at his watch; it was eight o\u2019clock. If this was another brother or, worse, his mother, he wasn\u2019t going to be able to control himself. He\u2019d been answering the phone, for God\u2019s sake. He hadn\u2019t been conversational, but he\u2019d answered. It was still a little raw, this thing with Shelby, but he was making progress. He slept now at least....</p><p>He opened the door and saw the Jeep. She stood in front of it, leaning against the hood, arms crossed over her chest, getting wet in the freezing drizzle. His heart lurched. Almost three weeks since he\u2019d seen her and his feelings hadn\u2019t given him a break. He still wanted her so bad it hurt.</p><p>\u201cYou never told me about Felicia,\u201d she yelled at him.</p><p>\u201cThat was a long time ago,\u201d he said loudly. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind. Didn\u2019t you trust me enough to tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cIt had nothing to do with anything.\u201d He took a step onto the porch. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear anything about you coming back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one knows I\u2019m here,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you think I\u2019ll be as bad as she was, is that it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I know better than that. You think I\u2019m the best you can do?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. Her hair was getting wet; her cheeks glistened. \u201cWhat if you are? How did I screw up? I thought I showed you I knew exactly what I wanted. You think I\u2019m fickle? That I\u2019m too young and too stupid to know whether I really love someone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not stupid\u2014 I never thought that. Young, maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\u2014you thought it was puppy love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing puppy about it. Come out of the rain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not until a couple of things are settled. If we can\u2019t come to terms, I\u2019ll go to the general\u2019s. But I\u2019m not moving to San Francisco\u2014I don\u2019t want to be there. I\u2019ve never lived in a big city and I don\u2019t like them that much. What I like is here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome up on the porch at least and we\u2019ll talk. Out of the wet and cold...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, holding her ground. \u201cMaybe I expected too much too fast, but you expected too little. I don\u2019t want another man\u2019s hands on me. Ever. This is where the only hands I ever want are. Yours. Only yours.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help but smile at her, standing so proudly, so stubbornly in the rain, arms crossed over her chest. \u201cThen why did you go? I never minded putting my hands all over you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI needed a tan. And I thought you didn\u2019t love me. I want more than this\u2014I want the whole deal. I want a child someday. It doesn\u2019t have to be soon\u2014but I want a child, at least one, and it has to have a father, and that\u2019s a deal breaker.\u201d</p><p>He tipped back his head with a laugh. \u201cWho do you think you are? Deal breaker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m the only woman you\u2019ve loved in forever. And you were going to pitch me out that fast, just because I make you nervous. I thought you didn\u2019t trust me, but now I think you don\u2019t trust yourself.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t want a man like that. I need a man with guts, who\u2019s sure of himself. Confident enough to stand by me. I need a man who\u2019s not afraid to take a risk or two for something important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve taken a risk or two,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t scare me. Come up here on the porch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not until you say that if we stay solid, there will be a real relationship and a family. I don\u2019t want any of this \u2018I don\u2019t get involved\u2019 shit. It\u2019s all crap, Luke. You can have some time to be sure, I\u2019m patient. But I\u2019m not giving you up.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her. \u201cI don\u2019t need time to be sure. I know how I feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill on that? Still that \u2018never gonna happen\u2019 bullshit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I guess it could happen,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it did happen, it would happen with you. I just always thought you deserved more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than everything I\u2019ve ever wanted in the world? See what an idiot you turned out to be?\u201d</p><p>He had to laugh. She was something, this woman. \u201cShelby, come here. I don\u2019t have to think about it\u2014you\u2019re the most solid thing I\u2019ve ever had in my life. Now come here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I wasn\u2019t enough for you\u2014but I was too much,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t get to decide what I deserve. What I deserve is a man who looks at me grow fat on his baby and feels pride. Love and pride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay then,\u201d he said. \u201cI love you. Come here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot good enough. You have to say something to convince me this is worth the gamble. I came a long way and I came alone. I was betting on you, on us. I love you and you love me and I\u2019m sick of screwing around. Say the right thing for once. Say something profound.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her and his smile slowly faded. He put his hands on his hips. He took a deep breath and felt tears gather in his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re all I need to be happy, Shelby,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re everything I need...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He actually surprised her. Her arms dropped from over her chest and she gaped at him for a second.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re everything,\u201d he said. \u201cIt scares me to death, but I want it all with you. I want you for life. I want what you want, and I want it right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEverything, Shelby. I want you to be the lead in my shoes that keeps me on the ground. The mother of my children. My best friend, my wife, my mistress. It\u2019s a tall order.\u201d He took a breath. \u201cIf you won\u2019t quit, I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure about that?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cSure it scares the hell out me you\u2019ll change your mind? Or sure I want it all? Oh, yeah, honey. I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t change my mind,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t hear you!\u201d he yelled. \u201cI can\u2019t hear you because you won\u2019t come out of the frickin\u2019 rain!\u201d</p> <p>She ran up the porch steps and into his arms. He lifted her off the floor and went after her mouth hungrily. She cried against his lips. He had a tear or two he ignored, loving her tears of relief.</p><p>\u201cAm I enough?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWay more, you always were,\u201d he said. \u201cI want you so bad, I never wanted you to go. I don\u2019t know if this is fair to you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the deal\u2014I decide what\u2019s fair to me, you decide what\u2019s fair to you. We stop deciding for each other. The idea is to work together. You\u2019re a little controlling....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m flawed in many ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I want is that you love me enough to make a life with me. It doesn\u2019t have to be tomorrow you make the promise, but you have to give us a chance...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt can be tomorrow. It can be tonight. Losing you almost killed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d she whimpered. \u201cCan you love me forever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably longer. It\u2019s like I don\u2019t have a choice. Think you can handle that?\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cYou just try me.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
