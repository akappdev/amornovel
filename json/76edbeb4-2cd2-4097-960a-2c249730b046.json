Shea</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>\u201cOne of your underlings made a mistake, Dewdrop. The royal fields yielded a higher income in wheat than what is recorded.\u201d</p> <p>The use of a sardonic nickname and the know-it-all tone Falk adopted as he stabbed his finger at the recorded accounts set Elise on edge.</p><p>\u201cYou are correct, brother. However, the recorded number is the gross profit. The number is derived after paying the farmers, subtracting the cost of seed, and so on. Also, I\u2019m afraid if there is a mistake in the agricultural accounts, you have me to blame as I was the only member of the Treasury Department to work on them,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>As if she would inflict Falk on any of her subordinates. Hah!</p><p>Falk leaned back in his chair. \u201cI am not your brother, Sweetling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI apologize, Prince Falk,\u201d Elise said as she fixed a smile on her face, wished Falk would go away, and forced her head down so she could continue copy-editing the Gold Army accounts.</p> <p>Elise loved her job as head of the Treasury Department. She loved numbers and finances. They always behaved as expected, and if something was wrong, the mistake could be traced. Furthermore, her position spoke volumes of the trust King Henrik placed in her. He might not love her enough to adopt her\u2014only to claim her as the royal family\u2019s foster child\u2014but he had so much faith in her that he charged her with building and distributing Arcainia\u2019s wealth.</p><p>However, on the days Prince Falk, one of her foster brothers, chose to visit her office to discuss the Agriculture Department\u2019s accounts, Elise wished King Henrik had trusted someone else with the task.</p><p>\u201cHow long did it take you to complete the Agriculture Department\u2019s audit?\u201d Falk asked, turning a page.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say I took note of it. May I inquire why the length of time would make a difference?\u201d Elise asked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry your pretty, little head, Fawn. I was only attempting to make polite conversation.\u201d</p><p>Elise very much doubted this, but she let the matter go. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p> <p>One of Elise\u2019s secretaries stood in the open doorway and tapped on the wall to announce her presence \u201cF\u00fcrstin,\u201d she said, drawing Elise\u2019s attention. For some reason beyond her understanding, Elise\u2019s subordinates went through extraordinary efforts to use old titles of nobility whenever one of her foster brothers was around. Elise\u2019s title of F\u00fcrstin was commonly translated to princess, but beyond signifying she was a child of royalty, it also meant she was the head of her family. As the royal family hadn\u2019t adopted her, this meant she outranked all but her eldest foster brother, the crown prince.</p><p>\u201cF\u00fcrstin,\u201d the secretary repeated. \u201cThe Kronprinz is\u2014,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can announce myself, thank you. Elise, that bloated pig has gone too far. Hello, Falk,\u201d Steffen, the crown prince, said as he edged his way into Elise\u2019s office.</p><p>Elise folded her hands in her lap. \u201cWho is a bloated pig?\u201d</p><p>Steffen ran a hand through his hair, mussing it. The gesture gave away his frustration. Typically Steffen looked as perfect as the portrait of him that hung in the main gallery. Every piece of his blonde hair was always settled in place; his uniform was never crooked; and his eyes crinkled with the slight, perpetual smile he constantly wore. Now, his eyes were uncharacteristically narrowed as he snapped, \u201cThe prince of Loire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich prince?\u201d Elise asked.</p><p>\u201cThe legitimate one. His father has asked us to give you over in marriage to that empty-headed buffoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cF\u00fcrstin,\u201d the secretary, who still hovered at the doorway, said. \u201cWould you like me to call for refreshments?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, please. Thank you, Gretta,\u201d Elise said, rearranging her papers.</p><p>The secretary bobbed a curtsey and disappeared from view.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you offended?\u201d Steffen asked, striking Elise\u2019s desk with a rolled up paper.</p><p>\u201cThe buffoon to which you are referring is the heir to the throne of a country that is three to four times as large as our beloved Arcainia. No, I cannot say I am the least bit offended,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>Falk, the stark opposite of his brother in resemblance and temperament, raised his eyebrows and said nothing.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you even surprised?\u201d Steffen asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFrom whom the offer originates, yes. As far as Loire knows, we are nothing but a small, powerless neighbor. It is unanticipated that Loire\u2019s King would choose Prince Lucien\u2019s bride\u2014the future queen of Loire\u2014to come from such a place,\u201d Elise said, making a tally mark on some parchment. \u201cNot to mention you hired an assassin guild to kill one of the princes. Even though the plan failed, they must know we financed the attempt. If they do not have proof right now, I imagine they will shortly\u2014those Rangers the Loire princes play around with are just as good as Mikk\u2019s sneaks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that is all that surprises you? I was shocked to receive the offer at all,\u201d Steffen said, looking around for a chair. He stared at Falk, who was sitting in the only free chair in the room, perched near Elise.</p><p>Falk stared back at Steffen and made a shooing motion.</p><p>Steffen rolled his eyes and found a chair under a precariously balanced stack of books, which he set on the ground before making himself comfortable.</p> <p>Elise cleared her throat after the interchange was over. \u201cYou think I am unmarriageable, Steffen? Or do you doubt anyone would want to marry the foster daughter of the King of Arcainia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it at all. You\u2019re a princess all the way through,\u201d Steffen said, his lips reforming into the usual smile. \u201cI merely think it is a little early for you to marry.\u201d</p><p>Elise went back to her accounts. \u201cI am 18, nearly 19. It is the right age for suitors to express interest,\u201d she said, copying down numbers.</p><p>\u201cYou are ready to be married, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is not so much that I am ready, but more that I cannot avoid the duty much longer. I have told Father as much.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve spoken to Father about marriage?\u201d Falk asked, straightening up in his chair.</p><p>\u201cBriefly. I told him I would never forgive him if he married me off to someone poor.\u201d</p><p>Steffen stared. \u201cWhy? You are not one to demand luxuries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed. But the north wall of the castle needs repairing, and it\u2019s going to be costly. My suitor could pay for it as the bride price,\u201d Elise said, dipping her quill into an inkwell of tar black ink. She paused. \u201cLoire is a very rich country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Steffen said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Falk repeated.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve already sent a refusal. It\u2019s probably a ploy. Some of Mikk\u2019s undercover men heard more rumors of Prince Lucien\u2019s warmongering. He\u2019s still set on coming after us,\u201d Steffen continued.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what was the purpose of storming my office to inform me of this development? Since you have already sent a refusal on my behalf, I don\u2019t have much to do with the matter,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cI wanted someone to complain to,\u201d Steffen said.</p><p>\u201cGabrielle wouldn\u2019t hear you out?\u201d Falk asked, referring to Steffen\u2019s wife, Princess Gabrielle.</p><p>\u201cGabi is gone for the day, and she took her dratted cat with her. Good riddance,\u201d Steffen said. \u201cSo you would seriously consider marriage? Not to the Loire Pig Prince of course, but to a suitable candidate?\u201d</p><p>Elise was spared from replying as her secretary, Gretta, arrived with the tea.</p> <p>\u201cYour refreshments, F\u00fcrstin,\u201d Gretta said, setting a tray laden with a three-person tea set and various treats on an end table another secretary brought in.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Gretta,\u201d Elise smiled.</p><p>The secretary gave Elise a dimpled smile before she left.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Steffen asked.</p><p>Elise stood and set about serving tea, pouring it with elegance and poise. \u201cI am a princess, Steffen. It is my duty as a member of this family\u2014foster child or not\u2014to marry for the betterment of our country. I have never shrunk away from my duties before, and I do not intend to start doing so now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s our Perfect Princess,\u201d Steffen said, repeating the court\u2019s pet name for Elise.</p><p>\u201cIf you say so. Tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you. So, do you have anyone in mind for marriage?\u201d Steffen asked.</p><p>Elise paused. \u201cPerhaps,\u201d she said, deliberately looking to her the door of her office. It opened into the Treasury Department\u2019s headquarters, and directly across the hall from the Treasury Department was the Commerce Department. Mertein\u2014the young noble who was casually courting her\u2014worked there.</p><p>\u201cHm. Should have guessed. I must be going; I have a somewhat urgent correspondence I must see to,\u201d Steffen said as he rocked to his feet. \u201cBut you two enjoy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you pleasant when you refused the Loire Crown Prince?\u201d Falk asked as he took the tea cup Elise offered him.</p><p>\u201cGoodness, no,\u201d Steffen said.</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d Falk said.</p><p>\u201cBe careful when playing with Loire, Steffen. That second prince is dangerous,\u201d Elise said, pouring a cup of tea for herself.</p><p>\u201cPrince Severin? He\u2019s not a beast anymore, did you hear? He went off and fell in love with a merchant\u2019s daughter. Broke the curse right off him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes that\u2019s why he\u2019s even more dangerous now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree. Take care, sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou as well, brother,\u201d Elise watched Steffen leave with a fond smile. He was the only member of the royal family who had encouraged her from the day she was taken in as a foster child to refer to him as brother.</p><p>She loved him for his acceptance.</p><p>\u201cI believe I found another error in my department\u2019s accounts, Dove.\u201d</p><p>Elise steeled herself to keep a grimace off her face. Steffen\u2019s acceptance was more than she could say for some of her other foster brothers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, Falk. Where is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere. We grew several acres more of alfalfa hay than what is recorded. I apologize, but it might take me more than one day to finish inspecting these numbers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will have to intrude upon you while I do so, of course. The Treasury Department records things differently than we do in the Agriculture Department.\u201d</p> <p>That would be just her luck. Elise bit her tongue to keep from snarling. \u201cOf course,\u201d she pleasantly said.</p><p>Two weeks later, Elise walked with her subordinates to the dining hall.</p><p>\u201cPrincess, would you look at the Carabas accounts after lunch? The master craftsman submitted their bid for the shipyard docks. I\u2019m not certain they used the right dimensions, based on their estimates,\u201d one bookkeeper asked.</p><p>\u201cI would be happy to, Fritz. Thank you for so carefully recording the bids,\u201d Elise said, tightening the red ribbon that held her unruly mess of curly, brown hair back in a ponytail.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my honor,\u201d Fritz said. \u201cThank you, Princess.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLisel, did the last payment for the college\u2019s new astronomy lab clear the daily treasury?\u201d Elise asked, craning her neck to look for the red-haired accountant in the herd of scholars that surrounded her.</p><p>\u201cIt did. It will dry the daily treasury for a time, but since we paid off our debts, we will no longer owe compounding interest. I suspect we\u2019ll recover in a matter of weeks,\u201d the accountant said, popping out in front of Elise.</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d Elise said as her employees stopped at the dining hall entrance. \u201cWith that our\u2014Yeek!\u201d Elise squealed when someone grabbed her from behind and swept her into the air.</p><p>\u201cWorking too much as usual, Elise?\u201d Elise\u2019s captor chuckled, still holding her aloft.</p><p>\u201cRune,\u201d Elise said, throwing her arms around the handsome man\u2019s shoulders. \u201cYou\u2019re back!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Steffen finally stopped handing out assignments and let me come home,\u201d Rune said, tucking an arm behind Elise\u2019s knees, so the black skirts of her work uniform cascaded from his hands.</p> <p>\u201cGood afternoon, Prince Rune,\u201d Elise\u2019s underlings chorused.</p><p>Rune gave the staff his most charming smile. \u201cGood afternoon, Treasury Department. Do you mind if I steal your chief for this meal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d they said, bobbing in curtseys and bows before they took their leave. \u201cEnjoy your lunch, F\u00fcrstin, Prinz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are still the number one idol and Treasury Department darling?\u201d Rune asked, watching the scholars enter the dining hall.</p><p>\u201cThey value my mental calculation abilities. Could you put me down?\u201d Elise asked.</p><p>\u201cAs you wish,\u201d Rune said, setting Elise on her feet.</p><p>Elise fussed with her uniform\u2014a simple but elegant black dress with white sleeves and gold trim\u2014before she fixed the red sash that crossed her chest and cinched around her waist, signifying her position as the Treasury Department head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you. I didn\u2019t know Steffen called you home,\u201d Elise said, checking her low ponytail before smiling at her foster brother.</p> <p>\u201cIt was rather sudden. He had something important he wanted to discuss with me,\u201d Rune said.</p><p>Elise frowned. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing for you to worry about,\u201d Rune said with another one of his dazzling smiles.</p><p>\u201cAh, hero work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>As the middle child of seven brothers, and all of them deeply involved in Arcainia\u2019s government, Rune was hailed as the heroic brother. He fit the image with his gold hair and dreamy hazel eyes. As Steffen liked to say, \u201cYou were made to be fawned over, so put your pretty face to good use and raise the public\u2019s opinion of us!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did your adventuring go?\u201d Elise asked.</p><p>\u201cWell enough. I trounced the ogre that set up camp in GlassGlow Forest, killed a sea serpent that was hindering restoration efforts at Carabas, took care of a chimera, and drove a few mountain hags back into Loire,\u201d Rune said, offering his arm.</p><p>\u201cI heard about the sea serpent. You did tidy work, from what I was told,\u201d Elise said, tucking her hand in Rune\u2019s elbow before they entered the busy dining hall.</p><p>Breakfast and lunch at Castle Brandis, the Arcainian palace, was a public affair. Soldiers, governmental staff members, servants, and nobility ate together in a massive dining hall that buzzed with conversation and gossip.</p><p>The tradition was scorned by some of the high-brow countries Arcainia shared borders with, like pompous Loire, but for a country as small as Arcainia, it provided an easy way of exchanging information and forming inter-department friendships.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure \u2018tidy\u2019 is the correct way to describe how I handled the situation. I killed a male sea serpent, but I am almost positive it had a mate. We can only hope they didn\u2019t have hatchinglings,\u201d Rune frowned. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWill you go out adventuring again, or are you here for the remainder of winter?\u201d Elise asked as they strolled through the noisy hall.</p><p>\u201cIt depends on Steffen. I hope he will let me stay, but he may not have a choice if more monsters arrive,\u201d Rune said.</p><p>\u201cIt seems like you have quelled more creatures and magical disturbances in the past few years than usual. You used to be able to spend all of winter with us in Castle Brandis,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cIt is partially because Father and Steffen trust me enough to know I won\u2019t break my neck, so they are able to send me out on more difficult missions that used to require the army. But there is some truth to your observations. There has been an increase in violent-minded creatures invading our borders,\u201d Rune said. \u201cI do not believe we are the only country encountering this phenomenon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHave we sent word to the Veneno Conclave? As the rulers and regulators of all magic users and magic itself, I imagine they would have something to say about this subject,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cI requested that Steffen would do so. He gave the task to Erick\u2014he has contacts with several enchanters and enchantresses,\u201d Rune said, referring to one of his brothers.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Elise said when they stopped at an empty table. She saw Mertein, who waved to her with a dimpled smile, sitting several tables away. Elise returned the smile and wave. She would have done more, but Rune interrupted her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cWe need to discuss Baron Ludwig von Drebkau,\u201d Rune said, pulling out a chair for Elise before he seated himself.</p><p>\u201cSo you stopped by his manor then? What did he have to say for himself?\u201d Elise asked, shifting all of her attention to Rune. She had spent months watching Baron Drebkau\u2019s tax reports and comparing them with his public claims. They hadn\u2019t matched up, which was usually a sign of illegal activities.</p> <p>\u201cHe was illegally importing luxury goods and selling them in the black market, as well as evading taxes by lying about his income. He has been corrected,\u201d Rune said. When he shifted, the sword strapped to his belt clanked ominously. \u201cIs there anyone else you need me to speak to?\u201d</p><p>In addition to serving as the public relations poster child, Rune was also something of a one-man secret police. He investigated and reprimanded persons of interest, occasionally with the aid of one of his older brothers depending on the suspected crime. Mostly he worked for Elise, helping her keep Arcainia\u2019s nobles in line and investigating their claims when Elise could not.</p><p>\u201cNone. I\u2019ve spent the past month going over the Defense Department\u2019s budget and expenses, but I haven\u2019t gotten very far,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cAre Mikk and Nick avoiding you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014worse. Falk is being obstinate over several items in the Agriculture Department\u2019s estimated budget,\u201d Elise sighed. She smiled at the serving maid who started loading food onto the table.</p><p>\u201cFalk is all bark. Tell him to accept your suggestions, or you\u2019ll cut department funding,\u201d Rune suggested. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said, giving the maid a dazzling smile.</p> <p>The serving maid set the last of the food and drinks on the table and bobbed a curtsey before she left, unaffected by Rune\u2019s good looks.</p><p>\u201cI can tell he is getting irritated with our meetings as well,\u201d Elise said, spearing a sausage.</p><p>\u201cFalk? How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis tone is increasingly sarcastic, and he\u2019s dropping nicknames like flower petals. Sugar Plum, Filly, Moonbeam, Ray of Sun. I have a theory. The more ridiculous they are, the more irritated he is,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry you feel that he is annoyed by you,\u201d Rune said, helping himself to a portion of salted fish.</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t much either of us can do about the situation. But let us talk of more pleasant things,\u201d Elise suggested.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Father? Doesn\u2019t he usually eat with everyone?\u201d Rune asked, nodding at the royal table where King Henrik usually ate with his councilors. Instead, a smiling Prince Steffen was seated in his place.</p><p>Elise sipped a mug of hot cider. \u201cHe\u2019s been going out a lot the past few weeks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGoing out? Going out where? It\u2019s the middle of winter. We had snow last week,\u201d Rune said.</p><p>\u201cI am not entirely certain. I talked to him about it once\u2014it\u2019s not good for him to miss so many lunches\u2014but he said he likes going to the forest to think,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cDoes he take a guard with him at least?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so,\u201d Rune said.</p><p>\u201cHe may simply miss Mother,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cMother has been dead for several years, and he has never done this before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but she died in winter. He may be trying to escape his memories of her death,\u201d Elise said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Queen Ingrid had passed away suddenly due to a fast onset sickness about three years ago. The entire country was devastated; Queen Ingrid was beloved by all. But King Henrik took it particularly hard. For a while, the royal family wasn\u2019t sure he would outlive Ingrid because he pined for her like a swan after it loses its mate. But with time and much love from his children, King Henrik returned to his joyful self.</p><p>\u201cIf that is the case, I cannot fault him. I can hardly point fingers for staunch loyalty in love,\u201d Rune said.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Elise said as a maid set a tray of apple fritters down.</p><p>\u201cGads, how I have missed eating in Brandis,\u201d Rune said, twitching a hot fritter off the tray.</p> <p>\u201cAnd we are ever so glad you have returned. Welcome home, Rune.\u201d</p><p>Rune licked sugar off his fingers. \u201cThank you. I\u2019m happy to be back,\u201d he said, his words adorned by a dangerously charming smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure the ladies of the court are especially glad,\u201d Elise said with the princess smile she reserved for state affairs. \u201cThere is a ball tonight, you know.\u201d</p><p>Rune winced. \u201cOh. What ill timing. I think I may have to make spontaneous inspections of the army barracks with Mikk and Nick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is unfortunate. I was looking forward to dancing with you,\u201d Elise said.</p> <p>\u201cFor you, My Lady, I would slay a dozen sea serpents or, even worse, attend a party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow very heroic of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed. If you wish it, I shall brave the ballroom tonight, but only if you allow me to be your escort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is very sad, but I must respectfully decline. Father still insists on being my escort. You could always ask him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could, but he is fiercely protective of the honor. I doubt I would succeed,\u201d Rune said.</p><p>\u201cI think he uses me to keep the eligible ladies and widows away,\u201d Elise said, helping herself to a fritter.</p> <p>\u201cIt would be the smart thing to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut will you come tonight anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill any of my brothers be there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGerhart will for certain, and Steffen of course. Falk usually comes to this sort of thing, but I don\u2019t think Erick will. He is still at the university, and he would have arrived by now if he meant to attend. As for Mikk and Nick, no one can pretend to predict what they will do,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you will attend,\u201d Rune said.</p><p>\u201cNaturally. It is one of my duties,\u201d Elise said before she bit into her fritter. She closed her eyes in ecstasy when she bit through the crunchy, sugared exterior.</p><p>\u201cNaturally,\u201d Rune echoed before he brushed sugar off Elise\u2019s cheek with a finger.</p><p>\u201cSo you will come?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI will come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Rune.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure, Elise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour country is so quaint, Princess. I dearly enjoy your state events; they are so charming in their modesty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are too kind, Ambassador Orazio,\u201d Elise said, her smile pasted in place. She had to be kind to Orazio. He was from Sole, one of the few countries Arcainia did not loan money to or ship many supplies and exports to. They were allied only through political maneuvering, which meant a misspoken word could bring the relationship crashing down.</p><p>\u201cIn Sole, a royal ball would so fill the royal palace, normal government activities would be halted for a week,\u201d Orazio continued, lifting his prominent nose into the air like the sail of a boat.</p><p>\u201cHow inconvenient. Although I suppose you must miss it?\u201d Elise said, feigning sympathy. Ambassador Orazio was a fussy, opinionated man. Elise did not enjoy speaking to him, but it was in Arcainia\u2019s best interests to see that he was properly entertained.</p><p>Orazio stroked his greasy goatee. \u201cThe food, the colors, the brilliance of Sole cannot be imitated. However, Arcainia is a pleasant post\u2014although I must confess I do not understand your obsession with work uniforms,\u201d he said, watching three secretaries from the Commerce Department walk past. Their department affiliation was clearly indicated by the black bands they wore on their arms over their party clothes.</p><p>\u201cFor a country as small as Arcainia, the uniforms provide an easy method of organization and wordless communication,\u201d Elise said, her hand lingering on the red sash tied around the waist of her white dress.</p><p>\u201cIf you say so, Princess,\u201d Orazio said, taking a goblet of wine from a serving maid. \u201cI find your lack of class distinction... refreshing,\u201d Orazio said, placing the pause to make it clear he found it anything but. \u201cIn Sole, hardly any sort of royal ball would allow government employees to attend.\u201d</p><p>If the royals are anything like you, it\u2019s no wonder, Elise wryly thought.</p><p>\u201cAnother symptom of our small country, I suppose. Our government subordinates have much to do with the running of the country, so we feel it is appropriate to welcome them into occasions of celebration,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Orazio said.</p><p>\u201cIf you will pardon us, Ambassador Orazio. Could you spare Elise for a few minutes?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Orazio and Elise turned to face Rune, who spoke the request, and Falk.</p><p>Standing side by side, the brothers made a stark contrast. Rune was bright with his glimmering gold hair, hazel eyes, and charming smile. Falk, on the other hand, had hair that was the dark shade of goldenrod\u2014the darkest out of any of the true children of King Henrik and Queen Ingrid\u2014and brown eyes that were the color of darkly stained wood. Rune was more relaxed; his jaw line, lips, and posture were curved like a soft smile. With Falk, everything from his hair to the distinct frown of his lips were jagged.</p><p>Orazio bowed. \u201cOf course. Prince Rune, Prince Falk,\u201d he said, his voice cool.</p><p>Elise blessed Orazio with one last portrait smile. \u201cIf you will excuse me, Ambassador,\u201d she said before she slipped away, a foster brother on either side.</p> <p>Once they were far enough away, Elise let her shoulders droop. \u201cThank you for the timely rescue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou looked like you were contemplating murder, Pearl,\u201d Falk said, as blunt as ever.</p><p>\u201cYou force yourself to speak to Orazio too much. He is as likeable as a skunk. You do not have to act as his personal host,\u201d Rune said, ignoring Falk\u2019s observation.</p><p>\u201cBut I do,\u201d Elise sighed. \u201cOrazio cannot abide Steffen, so Steffen asked me to keep an eye on him and converse with him in his place. Speaking of Steffen, where is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmoozing the Loire ambassador with Gabi,\u201d Falk said, nodding his head at the royal pair.</p> <p>Steffen and Gabrielle made a beautiful couple\u2014all smiles and good will\u2014as they conversed with the Loire ambassador.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re good,\u201d Elise said. \u201cLooking at them one would never realized we barely avoided a war just a few days ago when the Loire ambassador revealed they obtained the contract Steffen made with the Verglas Assassin\u2019s Guild.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSloppy work that was,\u201d Falk grunted.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t as close as one would think. I spoke to Mikk before the ball,\u201d Rune said. \u201cAccording to one of his sneaks, Prince Severin finally put his foot down and told Crown Prince Lucien he wouldn\u2019t let him declare war on us. Plus the contract was for an attempt on Prince Severin\u2019s life. If the guild, and Steffen, was serious, Prince Severin would be dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank heaven for large miracles,\u201d Elise sighed.</p><p>\u201cWe could have survived,\u201d Falk said.</p> <p>\u201cYes, but we would have pulled in every favor and debt we\u2019ve accumulated over the past decade,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cEither way, war has been deflected. With luck, our countries will remain allies, but for now it is better to focus on more important things,\u201d Rune said.</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d Falk asked, one of his eyebrows slanted in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cThe present, of course. Elise, you look beautiful tonight,\u201d Rune said, taking Elise\u2019s gloved hand and kissing her palm.</p><p>\u201cThank you. Based on court opinion, this goes without saying, but both of you look very dashing and handsome as well,\u201d Elise said, watching with amusement as several nearby noble ladies giggled and looked in their direction.</p><p>\u201cHmph,\u201d Falk said, directing his gaze away from the girls.</p><p>Rune, however, smiled and inclined his head at the ladies, making them giggle louder.</p><p>\u201cPrince Rune?\u201d a female garbed in a palace guard uniform said after approaching Elise and her foster brothers.</p> <p>\u201cYes?\u201d Rune said.</p><p>The guard removed her helmet and bowed.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Captain Meier,\u201d Rune said after identifying the guard.</p><p>\u201cGood evening Prince Rune, Prince Falk, and Princess Elise,\u201d the guard said, her greeting started warm, but her tone was chilled by the time she greeted Elise.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Brida,\u201d Elise said, familiar with the prickly warrior. She was a captain in the palace guard and was often assigned to guard Elise or Gabrielle as a result of her gender and Steffen\u2019s overactive imagination. She seemed to get along fine with Elise\u2019s family, but she was cold to Elise.</p><p>\u201cHow can we help you?\u201d Rune said.</p><p>Brida bowed again. \u201cI was speaking to Prince Nickolas. He expressed a wish to see you. I offered to fetch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to say it, but Nick must do without me. I have just rescued Elise from the clutches of a smug man, and I will not so easily surrender her company,\u201d Rune said, playfully smiling at Elise.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine; I see Mertein with some of the Commerce Department staff. I would like to speak to him,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cI bet you would,\u201d Falk muttered.</p><p>\u201cElise, you cannot mean to drop me so soon after I saved you,\u201d Rune said, his hazel eyes wide and sincere.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cI see how it is. You use me as your hero, and when you have no need of me, you dump me,\u201d Rune sighed, winking at an heiress who dawdled nearby.</p><p>\u201cYou found me out,\u201d Elise said, motioning at Mertein when she caught his eye to come closer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cVery well. You may leave. Just this once though,\u201d Rune said as Mertein approached them. \u201cI won\u2019t let you go running off with men much longer,\u201d he said, leaning over to kiss her forehead.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been out in the woods too long,\u201d Elise said, taking a step towards Mertein. \u201cBut I thank you all the same for the rescue\u2014you and Falk both.\u201d</p><p>Falk bowed. \u201cAlways,\u201d he said before stalking off, ignoring a pretty girl who tried to get his attention.</p><p>\u201cPrince Rune,\u201d Brida said.</p> <p>\u201cFine, fine. Where is Nick?\u201d Rune asked, turning away as Elise and Mertein clasped hands.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, F\u00fcrstin,\u201d Mertein said, bowing over Elise\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Mertein. I hope I did not pull you away from anything important?\u201d Elise asked.</p><p>Mertein shook his head. \u201cJust work discussion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Please pardon my rudeness, but I wanted to dance with you,\u201d Elise said.</p> <p>\u201cThere is nothing to pardon. I am happy to talk to and dance with you,\u201d Mertein said with a boyish smile.</p><p>\u201cHow have you been?\u201d Elise asked as the young man led her to the mass of swirling dancers.</p><p>\u201cQuite well, thank you,\u201d Mertein said. \u201cMy department is busy preparing for the opening of Carabas Harbor, but it is very exciting. And how are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs well as can be expected. I enjoy parties and feasts, but sometimes I feel they are more trouble than they are worth,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cBut that cannot be so,\u201d Mertein said with wide, innocent eyes. \u201cEveryone is such great company; the food is outstanding, and it is hard to otherwise find a suitable location in which to dance.\u201d</p><p>Elise smiled at Mertein\u2019s earnest statements. \u201cEverything you say is true. So, let us enjoy our dance,\u201d she said as they slipped into place among the dancers.</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely, Princess,\u201d Mertein said. \u201cI am glad I have convinced you.\u201d</p><p>Elise refrained from correcting the sweet boy. Later in the evening, she would have to attend to Ambassador Orazio\u2014a situation thorny enough to make the most enjoyable events sour. But Mertein\u2019s good humor was one of the things Elise liked about him. His good countenance would make marriage pleasant if King Henrik did not find a more suitable candidate.</p><p>\u201cFather. Father,\u201d Elise said, trying to get King Henrik\u2019s attention with no such luck. The King was seated in a chair behind his desk, staring vacantly at papers.</p><p>\u201cFather,\u201d Elise said, dropping a thick stack of reports on his desk, making a loud smack.</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon, who\u2014? Elise. H-hello, darling,\u201d King Henrik said, shaking his head as if to clear it. \u201cYou startled me, child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI apologize. I knocked before I entered,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>King Henrik smiled. \u201cI must have been deep in thought. How can I help you, daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have the finance reports you requested,\u201d Elise said, sliding the stack of papers across the desk.</p> <p>\u201cWonderful. Thank you for your swift work,\u201d King Henrik said as he flipped through the top few pages of the report with shaking fingers.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Father, are you alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d King Henrik said, looking up at Elise.</p><p>\u201cAre you feeling alright?\u201d Elise repeated.</p><p>\u201cOf course. Why wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou merely seem a little preoccupied,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cNonsense. I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m just fine...,\u201d King Henrik trailed off as he paged through the report.</p><p>\u201cFather?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you need anything more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, child. This is all for the moment. Thank you, Elise. Run along, now.\u201d</p><p>Elise retreated to the door of the king\u2019s private study. She studied her foster father as the normally attentive man flipped through the financial reports, scattering other papers to the floor.</p><p>It was odd behavior for man who was usually just as fastidious and dutiful as Elise.</p><p>Elise flattened her lips before she left the king\u2019s study. If the behavior persisted, she would mention it to her brothers.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>\u201cIt is a shame you have to leave so soon after your arrival. You haven\u2019t been home for a full month,\u201d Elise said, leaning against a stairway banister.</p><p>\u201cI know, but it was my mistake not to hunt down the female sea serpent as well. Carabas cannot afford to have a sea monster plaguing its harbor when we aim to open it for business in spring,\u201d Rune said.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Elise said. \u201cI shall miss you.\u201d</p><p>Rune smiled playfully\u2014a gesture that normally made women swoon. \u201cI shall miss you more,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cTake care, and be safe,\u201d Elise said, stepping closer to smooth a crease in his over shirt.</p><p>Rune was dressed in his usual hero garb of black breeches and boots with a black, fitted tunic trimmed in gold. \u201cI will do my best,\u201d Rune said, hefting his sword.</p><p>\u201cWhat-ho, my sweet little family?\u201d called one of two similar men who approached the staircase. They were big and broad shouldered, built like twin bulls. They were nearly identical, except one of the men had a crooked nose that looked like it had gotten smashed a couple dozen times.</p><p>\u201cGreetings, Nick and Mikk. I am leaving,\u201d Rune said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat? Already?\u201d Nick, the younger twin yelped.</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped. A sea serpent is lurking around Carabas\u2019 harbor,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cAgain? Weren\u2019t you dispatched to off one out there earlier this season?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cI was. This one was its mate,\u201d Rune said.</p> <p>Nick tisked. \u201cShame on you, little brother. And here I thought we raised you better than to miss monsters. That\u2019s sloppy work. Aren\u2019t you disappointed too, Mikk?\u201d</p><p>Mikk, the older, more serious, and less talkative of the twins, ignored Nick. \u201cWill you return after killing it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI plan to stay at Carabas for a few days. I mean to make sure there were no hatchinglings. Is there something you want me to look into?\u201d Rune asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Mikk said.</p><p>\u201cHave you two talked to Father recently?\u201d Nick asked, folding his arms across his massive chest.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cDid he seem a little odd?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by odd?\u201d Rune asked.</p><p>\u201cActing out of character, staring blankly into space, being easily distracted, things like that. Right, Mikk?\u201d Nick said.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Mikk said, a stony frown etched on his lips as he stared Elise down.</p><p>Elise resisted the urge to squirm under Mikk\u2019s rocky stare. She never felt that Mikk disliked her, as Falk and Gerhart seemed to, but she suspected she did not measure up to his expectations, and he seemed to vaguely disapprove of her. Whenever she was with him, there was an extra layer of pressure in the air.</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps, yes,\u201d Elise said. \u201cThe past few times I have spoken to him, he has been distracted. I usually have to make a loud noise to get his attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think something is wrong?\u201d Rune asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not certain. Our line of business tends to breed paranoia, but it\u2019s always best to be on your toes,\u201d Nick said, tapping his broken nose.</p><p>Elise and the royal siblings grimly stared at each other, but the seriousness of the moment was broken by a peal of tittering laughter that echoed up the stairwell.</p><p>\u201cYou wound me, My Lady, with your laughter. I am serious!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you cannot be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I am. I would positively perish if not for seeing your bright smile every day, Lady Meinhilde.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrince Gerhart, you are too charming!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlease, call me Hart.\u201d</p><p>The male flirt was the youngest of the royal siblings, Prince Gerhart. He was an angel-faced teenager with curly hair and deceptively innocent eyes. He pushed and peddled his charms as part of his training for his future with the Foreign Affairs Department.</p><p>\u201cPrince Gerhart, I could never take such liberties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven when I beg you to? I would be delighted to hear my nickname uttered by such sweet lips.\u201d</p><p>Elise shook her head as Mikk\u2019s lips flattened in great disapproval. Nick, however, took action. He leaned over the banister and called in a loud yodel, \u201cGerhie! There you are, you naughty boy. Come up and wish your big brother Rune goodbye. He\u2019s leaving, you know. Gerhie! Why won\u2019t you look at me?\u201d</p><p>Elise and Rune stifled laughter as they watched their younger brother\u2019s expression change from sophistication to mortification.</p><p>Gerhart bowed and made an excuse to his female companion before bounding up the stairs, taking them two at a time. \u201cWas that necessary?\u201d he snarled.</p><p>\u201cOf course it was, Gerhie. You wouldn\u2019t want to miss saying farewell to your dashing, heroic brother. Would you?\u201d Nick asked, batting his eyelashes\u2014a ridiculous gesture given his girth and size.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me Gerhie!\u201d Gerhart said.</p><p>\u201cTemper, temper. If you don\u2019t learn to control your emotions, you\u2019ll never be as popular with the ladies as Rune is,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>Gerhart plunged his hands into his thick hair as if he wanted to pull it out of his scalp. He jumped when Rune placed a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cTake care, Gerhart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really leaving then?\u201d Gerhart asked.</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019ll return to being number one in the social scene,\u201d Gerhart nodded.</p><p>\u201cOnly if the black horse doesn\u2019t rear his head,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>\u201cFalk is antisocial. He has admirers, but I am liked by all,\u201d Gerhart said, puffing up his chest.</p><p>\u201cTrue, you and the Perfect Princess are the court darlings,\u201d Nick said, ruffling Gerhart\u2019s hair.</p><p>\u201cGet off! And I am certainly above Elise\u2019s level of popularity,\u201d Gerhart said, disdain dripping from his words.</p><p>\u201cSpoiled brat,\u201d Mikk said.</p><p>\u201cAm not,\u201d Gerhart said, folding his arms.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m off. I need to leave or I won\u2019t make it to Carabas by dark. Brothers, take care. Elise, don\u2019t overwork yourself,\u201d Rune said, hugging Elise.</p><p>\u201cGoodbye, Rune,\u201d Elise and her foster brothers chorused as Rune trotted down the stairs, heading for the entrance of Castle Brandis where his horse waited.</p><p>\u201cThat was touching. So, who is up for a round of cards?\u201d Nick asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI must return to my office and finish copy-editing the Black Army\u2019s accounts.

What-ho!\u201d Nick said before leaving as abruptly as he arrived, his twin moving in his shadow.</p><p>\u201cDo you have plans for the afternoon, Hart?\u201d Elise asked.</p><p>Gerhart tipped his chin up. \u201cHmph,\u201d he said, a high pitched noise exhaled from his nose. He turned on his heels and went back down the stairs.</p> <p>Elise sighed as she watched the young prince go before she smoothed the black skirts of her work uniform and set out as well.</p><p>Elise was last to arrive to the royal family dinner some weeks later\u2014or the second to last, as it were. \u201cWhere is Father?\u201d Elise asked.</p><p>\u201cDunno,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>Princess Gabrielle, Steffen\u2019s beautiful wife, further explained. \u201cGood evening, Elise. King Henrik should be along shortly. He sent a note ahead of him; he is bringing a guest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Elise said, heading for her usual chair between Nick and Falk. When sitting by age, as the Arcainia Royalty tended to do for formal occasions, Elise sat between Falk and Gerhart. However, the youngest prince gave Elise dirty looks and would ignore her for the duration of the meal if she tried to sit near him at a time when it was not required.</p> <p>As Steffen and Gabrielle were seated next to the King, Elise usually chose to sit with her friendliest brother, Nick, when Rune or her remaining foster brother, the intellectually minded Erick, were not present.</p><p>\u201cHey there, Perfect Princess. Sit on down and join in the fun,\u201d Nick said, pushing Elise\u2019s chair out for her.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cDoes anyone know who this mysterious guest is?\u201d Nick asked, turning back to his siblings once Elise was seated.</p><p>\u201cI have not heard of any visiting dignitaries,\u201d Falk said, rubbing a lock of his stick straight hair between his fingers.</p><p>\u201cNo one new has entered Castle Brandis,\u201d Mikk said.</p> <p>\u201cFather hasn\u2019t been meeting specifically with any family of nobility,\u201d Gerhart said. \u201cNo one\u2019s been trying to squirrel their way into our good graces either\u2014well, no more so than usual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems odd that he would invite a guest to a family dinner,\u201d Princess Gabrielle said.</p><p>\u201cIf his counselors are going to join us, he tells us several days in advance. This was very sudden,\u201d Steffen said.</p><p>Nick nudged Elise. \u201cHas he said anything to you, Elise? After Steffen and Gabi you see him the most.\u201d</p><p>Elise shook her head. \u201cFor the past week, he has spoken little with me, except...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Mikk said, leaning forward so he could peer past his twin and stamp Elise with one of his heavy gazes.</p><p>\u201cHe has taken a sudden interest in Arcainia\u2019s gross income and wealth,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>Gerhart snorted. \u201cHe\u2019s King. It\u2019s not odd that he should be concerned with his country\u2019s finances.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, of course. But he\u2019s requested a number of reports. He wants to know on a daily basis what the accumulated wealth is. Previously, he would ask for estimates. Now he wants specifics,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>Mikk tapped the table with a spoon as he thought.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps it is time that we more closely watch Father,\u201d Steffen said.</p><p>Nick nodded, looking like Mikk in his seriousness.</p><p>Before any of the other siblings could respond, the doors banged open, and King Henrik entered the private dining room with a tall, regal woman.</p><p>\u201cChildren, allow me to introduce you to Lady Clotilde,\u201d King Henrik said, approaching the table.</p><p>Elise and her foster siblings stood, inclining their heads in deference to their father.</p><p>Elise studied Lady Clotilde under her eyelashes. The woman was almost as tall as most of Elise\u2019s foster brothers. Her shoulders were wide, but she walked with an air of self-assurance few ladies of Arcainia could muster. Although she was King Henrik\u2019s guest, she wasn\u2019t more than a year or two older than Steffen. She was fair haired and had light blue eyes that were almost colorless. She was pleasing to look at, but she gave off the same sort of sharp beauty as a crow or a bird of prey.</p><p>King Henrik smiled widely as he escorted his companion to the table, seating her in the empty seat next to his.</p><p>\u201cLady Clotilde, may I introduce you to my children: Kronprinz Steffen and his wife Prinzessin Gabrielle, Prinz Mikkael, Prinz Nickolas, Prinz Falk, Prinz Gerhart, and F\u00fcrstin Elise,\u201d King Henrik said before he too sat.</p><p>The introduction bothered Elise. Whenever King Henrik introduced his family he usually waxed poetry over them for a bit and called them by their first name. Never before had King Henrik introduced her in an informal occasion as F\u00fcrstin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The twins exchanged a sort of secret glance between them, and although Steffen and Gabrielle wore their usual serene expressions, Elise was certain they exchanged some sort of signal because they did not look at each other.</p><p>Elise looked to Falk, whose eyebrows lowered over his piercing brown eyes. Gerhart was unsettled. Elise knew this because he did not ooze charm and instead sipped wine from a goblet, hiding his lower face as he studied his father\u2019s companion.</p><p>\u201cIt is our pleasure to meet you, Lady Clotilde,\u201d Gabrielle said, speaking on behalf of the king\u2019s shocked children.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Lady Clotilde said with a deep, throaty voice. She spared Elise and her foster siblings a glance but focused most of her attention on King Henrik, Steffen, and Gabrielle. \u201cI am delighted to be here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI met Lady Clotilde in the woods not far from Brandis. She lives there in a charming house,\u201d King Henrik volunteered. \u201cI have visited her many times during these winter months. She has become a dear companion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are too kind, My Lord,\u201d Lady Clotilde said as the servants started bringing in trays of food and setting them down on the table.</p><p>Elise and her family immediately began helping themselves to the food, selecting sliced apples, stewed carrots, parsnips, and cuts of beef and pork.</p><p>Only Lady Clotilde did not reach for a dish or food of any sort. Instead, she frowned. \u201cWhy do the servants not serve you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should they? We\u2019ve got perfectly capable arms,\u201d Nick said.</p> <p>\u201cWe generally dine with informality. Times of serving are restricted only to dinners involving politics, visiting monarchs, and matters of the country,\u201d King Henrik said, patting Lady Clotilde\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cYou should change that. It\u2019s not proper,\u201d Lady Clotilde said.</p><p>\u201cIf you wish, my dear; you may change it later.\u201d King Henrik said.</p><p>Falk straightened up. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhh, yes. That brings me to the news I wish to share with all of you. I have asked Lady Clotilde to marry me, and she has consented,\u201d King Henrik said.</p><p>Elise choked on her apple slice; Nick spewed out the mouthful of beer he was in the process of drinking, and Mikk\u2014who was cutting his beef\u2014made his pewter plate shriek when his knife slide across the surface. Gerhart dropped the gravy bowl he was passing to Falk, spilling gravy everywhere and making a tremendously loud crack. The noise was eclipsed, though, by a servant who was in the process of bringing in a meat jelly and dropped the pan in surprise at the proclamation.</p> <p>Only Falk, Steffen, and Gabrielle were composed.</p><p>Steffen\u2019s eyes still crinkled in his perpetual smile. \u201cYou are to wed? You have our congratulations, as well as our deepest sorrow that Father did not think to introduce you to us sooner, Lady Clotilde,\u201d Steffen said.</p><p>\u201cWhen do you plan to hold the marriage?\u201d Gabrielle asked.</p><p>\u201cThe first of spring,\u201d King Henrik said.</p><p>\u201cIn a month? Are you mad?\u201d Gerhart yelped.</p><p>Falk kicked Gerhart under the table after Mikk nodded at him.</p><p>\u201cThat is a brief courtship,\u201d Gabrielle tactfully acknowledged.</p><p>\u201cI want you children to warmly welcome Lady Clotilde into our family,\u201d King Henrik continued, unaffected by Gerhart\u2019s remarks. \u201cLove her and treat her as you would your own Mother, for she is to replace her and eclipse her in your hearts.\u201d</p> <p>Silence reigned over the table.</p><p>Elise and her siblings stared at their father, stricken more by this proclamation than by King Henrik\u2019s sudden intent to marry. Queen Ingrid was the family treasure. Although the Arcainian royal family was closer than most ruling families, there was tension between them. Queen Ingrid was the one person who was able to pull them together, regardless of the situation.</p><p>She could never be replaced.</p><p>The stubborn stillness betrayed the royal family\u2019s thoughts over King Henrik\u2019s bride, and King Henrik grew stormy in the open sign of rebellion. His frown turned into a scowl as his children remained silent.</p><p>Sensing the mounting pressure, Elise stood. She walked to Lady Clotilde\u2019s seat and folded herself in an ornamental curtsey. \u201cI welcome you to our family, Lady Clotilde. I look forward to learning more about you, and I hope you will enjoy your new life here in Castle Brandis,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>One by one, the other royal siblings stood and joined Elise in front of Lady Clotilde, bowing or curtsying to her.</p><p>\u201cBrown-noser,\u201d Gerhart whispered to Elise.</p><p>\u201cNothing good will come of angering father and alienating his bride,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cOf course you would know that,\u201d Gerhart said before he threw himself back in his seat, angrily mixing his jellied meat with his mashed potatoes.</p><p>\u201cMikk, send for Erick and Rune, now,\u201d Steffen whispered behind a frozen smile before he retreated to his chair.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to the family, Lady Clotilde. If you will excuse me, Father, Lady Clotilde,\u201d Mikk said. He left the room when King Henrik acknowledged him with a hand.</p><p>\u201cOf course, my boy. Go ahead.\u201d</p><p>When everyone was seated, Nick leaned back, using Elise as a physical barrier so he could whisper to Falk, \u201cI guess we should have started watching him closer months ago.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo it would seem,\u201d Falk said.</p><p>\u201cSo it would seem,\u201d Elise echoed.</p><p>Elise watched a number of Arcainian subjects throw handfuls of uncooked rice and seeds at King Henrik and Lady\u2014now Queen\u2014Clotilde\u2019s open top carriage. They waved banners and flags of Arcainian colors\u2014black and gold\u2014that were embroidered with the country\u2019s symbol, a white swan.</p><p>Having witnessed the marriage, Elise and her siblings were following on horseback and in carriages as part of the marriage procession that wove through the city before returning to Castle Brandis for the wedding feast.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what to make of the new queen, do you?\u201d</p><p>Elise glanced Erick, the last of her foster brothers to arrive to the wedding. He was seated in the carriage with her and Gerhart. Steffen and Gabrielle were in their own open-top carriage just behind King Henrik and Queen Clotilde\u2019s, and the rest of the Arcainian princes were riding.</p><p>Elise hesitated, trying to find polite words to describe the feeling Clotilde gave her.</p><p>\u201cYou find her unsettling,\u201d Erick said.</p><p>Elise winced. She glanced at the crowds, but no one noticed the serious discussion held between Elise and Erick. (Who would, after all, with all the handsome princes of Arcainia being aired out at the same time?) \u201cYes,\u201d she admitted.</p> <p>Erick smiled. \u201cSo do I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something about her. It\u2019s not the way she looks, or that she has said anything unpleasant. She looks at everything as if looking forward to the day that it is hers,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cIndeed, why else would she marry a man nearly twice her age?\u201d Erick said.</p><p>\u201cErick!\u201d Elise said.</p><p>It was a good thing Gerhart was in the carriage with them. He smiled and waved so beautifully at the crowds no one was likely to notice Elise\u2019s shock.</p><p>Erick smiled again. \u201cTis true,\u201d he said before his eyes lost the sparkle of his smile. \u201cShe feels likes magic.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn Arcainia? That cannot be,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cI have met quite a few enchanters and enchantresses at the Arcainian Royal College. I know what magic feels like, and Clotilde has it,\u201d Erick said.</p><p>\u201cBut magic is outlawed here. It has been since Father married Mother,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cNo, performing magic is against the law. Any magic user can enter Arcainia\u2019s borders,\u201d Erick countered.</p><p>Elise looked to the carriage King Henrik and Queen Clotilde rode in. The new queen was smiling. It was a thin, brittle gesture, and although she looked beautiful, she did not look particularly happy.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d Elise asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat we\u2019ve been doing. I\u2019m reaching out to some of my contacts. If we can get a high-level magic user here, they could at least tell us if Clotilde is something to worry about or not,\u201d Erick says.</p><p>\u201cYou are going back to the college?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor now. I am the chancellor; I cannot abandon it. However, I will return home more often. Rune will remain here at least through the spring and summer. By then, a magic user should arrive,\u201d Erick said.</p><p>Elise nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou will have to keep being the Perfect Princess,\u201d Erick said.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather isn\u2019t happy with our reaction to his marriage. From what Steffen tells me, only you and Gabrielle reacted with any decorum. You are still in his good graces. You must stay there,\u201d Erick said.</p><p>Elise offered Erick a weary smile. \u201cIsn\u2019t that my job already?\u201d</p><p>Erick chuckled as the carriage rolled to a stop in front of Brandis. \u201cAnd that is why the country treasures you.\u201d</p><p>Elise squared her shoulders before she stepped down from the carriage with Erick\u2019s assistance.</p><p>Servants and attendants swarmed the carriages as everyone stepped into their places for Clotilde\u2019s first entrance into Brandis as its queen.</p><p>Mertein was there. Elise managed to grasp his hand and linger by him for a moment.</p><p>\u201cYou look stunning,\u201d Mertein said, squeezing her hand.</p><p>\u201cThank you. I will be glad when the feast begins, though,\u201d Elise said. \u201cMy cheeks hurt from all the smiling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it is such a happy occasion,\u201d Mertein said.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Elise said, slow to agree.</p><p>\u201cF\u00fcrstin, F\u00fcrstin! Here, your flute,\u201d an attendant called, presenting Elise with the gold-leafed instrument.</p><p>Elise took the instrument with a smile. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said, before turning to Mertein. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, I had best get into position.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Will you save me a dance?\u201d Mertein asked.</p><p>\u201cWith pleasure,\u201d Elise said, extracting her hand and curtseying. She clenched the flute in her hands as she hurried up the stairs. She waited on the top stair with the rest of the royal family, stretching her fingers into the right position.</p><p>She was the only member of the royal family who played an instrument to a degree of expertise. As such, she was usually required to play on important days, like today. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEveryone ready?\u201d Steffen asked as the Arcainian flag\u2014a white swan set on a background of black and gold\u2014unfurled above them.</p><p>\u201cI hate formal wear,\u201d Nick complained. \u201cWe look like fairies, or a set of tiara brothers,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHush up, and smile,\u201d Gabrielle said, straightening the Nick\u2019s crooked circlet.</p><p>Only the king and queen of Arcainia wore crowns. All other members of the royal family wore artfully crafted metal circlets studded with gems...or, as Nick had called them, tiaras.</p> <p>When King Henrik and Queen Clotilde started up the wide, sweeping stairs that lead to Brandis, Elise started playing her flute.</p><p>She played perfectly. The song was bright and cheerful. It was meant to sound like a welcome to the new queen, and it did even though Elise privately wanted to do everything but welcome Clotilde to Brandis.</p><p>Elise\u2019s timing was exactly on, and she finished the song just as King Henrik and Queen Clotilde joined Elise, Gabrielle, and the princes on the top step.</p><p>In unison, the siblings bowed. \u201cWelcome to Castle Brandis,\u201d they said.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Queen Clotilde said, removing her hand from King Henrik\u2019s arm so she could properly embrace them.</p> <p>Elise was near the end of the receiving line. She smiled her first real smile of the day when King Henrik kissed her forehead. \u201cThat was well played, darling,\u201d he said before he moved on to speak with Gerhart.</p><p>Queen Clotilde was right behind King Henrik. She didn\u2019t embrace Elise, as she did Elise\u2019s foster siblings. \u201cYou and I have much to talk about, F\u00fcrstin,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Elise asked, still smiling.</p><p>\u201cYes. Henrik tells me you are the chief of the Treasury Department.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish to discuss Arcainia\u2019s finances with you. Could you make time for me later this week?\u201d</p> <p>Elise kept her smile firmly in place. \u201cOf course, my queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, F\u00fcrstin,\u201d Clotilde said before she moved onto Gerhart.</p><p>Elise briefly felt for the golden key that hung from the red sash of her work uniform. It wasn\u2019t there, of course, as she was wearing a new dress for the wedding.</p><p>Erick had guessed right. Clotilde unsettled Elise, but that wasn\u2019t all.</p><p>Clotilde made her skin crawl.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>\u201cI think we should have a race to see who has the fastest horse,\u201d Nick said a sunny, spring afternoon as the royal family (or most of it) was sharing a horse ride at the request of the king.</p><p>\u201cOnly if Rune is banned from entering. He always wins,\u201d Gerhart complained.</p> <p>\u201cCome on everyone, line up. Except for you, Rune. Gerhart is right. You spend too much time in the saddle, so you and your horse have an unfair advantage. Elise, you will join us, yes?\u201d Nick said.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps she doesn\u2019t wish to join in this folly,\u201d Falk said, lining his horse up with Nick\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cNonsense. All of us royal siblings love horses and going fast. Come on, Elise,\u201d Nick called.</p><p>\u201cElise, if I may have a word,\u201d Queen Clotilde called.</p><p>Elise gave her foster brothers an apologetic look before she turned her mare in the direction of Queen Clotilde\u2019s pony cart, for once not sorry to attend to her.</p><p>\u201cYes, Queen Clotilde?\u201d Elise asked, directing her mare to walk next to Clotilde\u2019s cart.</p><p>\u201cSteffen, aren\u2019t you joining us?\u201d Nick called.</p><p>\u201cNot on your life. It\u2019s too unseemly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuit yourself. Will you make the countdown then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish. On the count of three. One...two... three!\u201d</p><p>Clotilde waited to speak until Mikk, Nick, Falk, and Gerhart galloped off.</p><p>\u201cI visited the royal vault yesterday. The guards would not let me inside even though I am the queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease do not take it personally. They were following protocol,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cIf the queen cannot visit it, who, then, can?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly me, My Queen,\u201d Elise said. She refrained from explaining that she could authorize anyone to visit the vault\u2014the vault only held enough funds to keep the country running for a month, after all. Several members of the Treasury Department had the clearance to add and remove funds from the vault whenever necessary.</p><p>\u201cI see. This is a rule you have made?\u201d Queen Clotilde asked, her voice hardening.</p><p>\u201cNo. It was a royal decree Father made before he gave me the office of chief of the Treasury Department,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cBy your Father, I take it you meant to say King Henrik?\u201d</p><p>Elise swallowed the rage that bubbled in her throat. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Queen Clotilde repeated.</p><p>\u201cDid you have any other questions?\u201d Elise asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, that is all. Good day, F\u00fcrstin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood Day, My Queen,\u201d Elise said before nudging her horse forward.</p><p>Elise eagerly trotted ahead, joining Steffen. \u201cWho won?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cFalk, I think. His horse is a racer. We should catch up and find out,\u201d Steffen said, discreetly glancing over his shoulder at Queen Clotilde. \u201cWhat did she want?\u201d he asked in a lowered tone as they left the new queen behind.</p><p>\u201cShe wanted to know why she couldn\u2019t enter the vault,\u201d Elise said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Steffen whistled. \u201cNot good. Does she know about the treasury?\u201d</p><p>The treasury was the storehouse of royal treasure. Elise carefully built it up since the day she first took office. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t think so, or she would have demanded to know why she couldn\u2019t enter that too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet us keep it that way. We\u2019ve spent too many years working towards expanding Arcainia\u2019s monetary power to let a spoiled harpy ruin it now,\u201d Steffen said, his voice and expression pleasant in spite of the hostility of his words.</p><p>\u201cPrince, Princess!\u201d</p> <p>Elise and Steffen halted their horses, letting a courier on the back of a lithe horse overtake them.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Prince Rune?\u201d the courier asked as his horse pranced in a circle.</p><p>\u201cFurther ahead. What is it?\u201d Steffen asked, pointing to the glob of royal brothers and their mounts.</p><p>\u201cA giant attacked one of the villages. Everyone is safe. The villagers fled to an army fortification, but the creature is flattening every structure in the area,\u201d the courier said before he kicked his horse, which shot forward like flying bird.</p><p>\u201cA giant,\u201d Elise repeated. \u201cHas there ever been a giant in Arcainia before?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. Not for a century at least,\u201d Steffen said.</p><p>\u201cThere were hellhounds last week, and a pack of goblins two weeks before that. What is going on?\u201d</p><p>Steffen shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. But it is not a good omen.\u201d</p><p>Elise hurried down the hallway, wincing when she heard a harsh, raised voice.</p><p>\u201cCarful, F\u00fcrstin. She\u2019s worked herself into a tizzy,\u201d a washerwoman warned as she thumped down the hallway, carrying a load of clothes.</p><p>\u201cIt certainly sounds like it. Thank you,\u201d Elise said, giving the washerwoman a brief smile before she rushed to the royal apartments.</p> <p>Elise hesitated at the door. The shouts were coming from inside, and there was an expensive sounding crash as something shattered against the wall.</p><p>Elise knocked, and the door opened to her father. In spite of Clotilde yelling and pacing behind him, he had a pleasant smile. (Steffen had to inherit it from someone, Elise supposed.) \u201cDaughter, how good of you to join us,\u201d King Henrik said.</p><p>\u201cHow may I be of service, Father?\u201d Elise asked, dipping into a curtsey before she entered the royal apartments.</p><p>\u201cMy dear Clotilde has some concerns over her wardrobe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI apologize, but I am not involved in the actual usage of goods. I only deal in their purchase,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cYes, it is the financial aspect that seems to be the problem,\u201d King Henrik said.</p><p>\u201cWhy must I have a budget for clothing? Would you have me dress like a peasant? Am I not sufficiently royal enough for you to concern yourself with letting me look presentable?\u201d Clotilde demanded, twisting an expensive, imported paper fan in her hands.</p><p>\u201cNot at all. Every member of the royal family has a budgeted amount for their clothing. We must be held accountable for our spending, My Queen,\u201d Elise countered with a steady, pleasant voice.</p> <p>\u201cThen why is mine so little? Gabrielle is only the wife of the crown prince, and she is dressed better than I. I should dress like a queen, not like a...maid!\u201d Clotilde said before carelessly tossing the fan.</p><p>Elise bit her tongue to keep from uttering a sharp reply. She very much wished she could tangle her hands in Clotilde\u2019s pretty blonde hair and drag her from Brandis, kicking and screaming. The new queen was dressed in an expensive gown of lavender silk. She wore strings of sapphires and pearls around her neck and woven through her hair. To top off the look, her slippers were made of white silk and embroidered with real gold thread. No one in the royal family dressed so lavishly. No one but Clotilde.</p><p>\u201cPrincess Gabrielle\u2019s wardrobe expenses are significantly less than yours. If you feel she is dressed better, perhaps you should ask who tailors her dresses,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cDo not lie to me. She wears jewels and gems of the likes I have never seen before,\u201d Clotilde said.</p><p>\u201cIt is very likely that those jewels are her personal property. Before she married Steffen, she was the Marquise of Carabas. She still owns those lands and the wealth they accumulate. The Treasury Department is not responsible for her personal finances and how she wishes to use her income from Carabas. However, though I do not know Gabrielle well, I can assure you that she spends a great deal less on her wardrobe than you,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cThen why are visiting ambassadors dressed better than I? The ambassador\u2019s wife from Loire is dressed how I should be dressed. I will not stand to be upstaged by an ambassador!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain, My Queen, I am forced to remind you that I am responsible only for Arcainia. I do not busy myself with other country\u2019s business and budgets,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cFine. Then I want an increased amount for my wardrobe,\u201d Clotilde said.</p><p>\u201cIt cannot be done,\u201d Elise said without hesitation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou dare refuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is not a matter of refusal as much as it is a matter of balance. Arcainia cannot afford to spend more on your wardrobe,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>Clotilde looked murderous.</p><p>\u201cThere, there, my dove. All is not lost. No matter what you wear, you look bewitching,\u201d King Henrik cooed, placing an arm around Clotilde.</p> <p>\u201cI want more,\u201d Clotilde said, folding her arms like a pouting child.</p><p>\u201cIf Elise says it cannot be done, then it cannot be done. But do not fret; I will give you some of my personal money for you to spend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you cut back spending in other areas?\u201d Clotilde complained.</p><p>Elise swallowed, unwilling to answer.</p><p>\u201cMy children are, above all, trustworthy, my dove. They are doing their best for Arcainia. We must let them continue with their work,\u201d King Henrik said.</p> <p>\u201cIf that was all you wished to discuss, may I leave?\u201d Elise asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, Elise, you may go. Thank you for your explanation,\u201d King Henrik said, patting Clotilde\u2019s hair.</p><p>Clotilde didn\u2019t say anything, but she narrowed her nearly colorless eyes at Elise, and her fetching face turned ugly with the glare she gave her.</p><p>Elise curtseyed and hustled out of the room. When the door clicked shut behind her, she ran down the hall like a frightened rabbit.</p><p>She had just made an enemy out of Clotilde, and she wasn\u2019t sure what the outcome would be.</p><p>\u201cI think it is high time F\u00fcrstin Elise marries,\u201d Clotilde announced several weeks later during the family breakfast.</p> <p>Gone were the days when the royal family ate merrily with the rest of the residents of Castle Brandis. Since Clotilde had been crowned, she insisted they eat separately\u2014with servants serving them on their finest plates of porcelain and gold.</p><p>Elise looked up from her eggs. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not understand why you felt the need to take on a foster daughter in the first place, Henrik. With seven sons, a fosterling is hardly necessary. But as you have her now, it would be shameful to cast her out, and she may as well be of use after living off you for so many years. Marry her off to a foreign duke or baron who will pay handsomely for her,\u201d Clotilde said.</p><p>Nick slammed his fist on the table. \u201cYou cannot be serious,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou seem to misunderstand, My Queen, Elise\u2019s relationship with our family,\u201d Steffen said, his eyes crinkled in his ever present smile after he shot Nick a warning look. \u201cOfficially Elise is a foster daughter, yes. But she is for certain a part of this family. She is my treasured sister, and I am not quite willing to part with her yet, nor would I ever wish to see her marry outside of Arcainia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo matter if she is a foster daughter or not, it is the duty of female royalty to marry. Soon no one will want her, and she will be too old to marry. And what better way to spread Arcainia\u2019s influence then to send her off to another country to fortify friendly relations? You understand what I\u2019m saying, don\u2019t you, Henrik?\u201d Clotilde simpered.</p><p>\u201cF\u00fcrstin Elise is the head of the Treasury Department. There are none who can replace her at this time, My Queen,\u201d Mikk stiffly said, as if the admission pained him.</p><p>\u201cRegardless of her marriage, she must be replaced. It is shameful for the children of monarchs to work like, like peasants,\u201d Queen Clotilde said.</p> <p>\u201cDo you mean to imply we all should retire from our positions in Arcainia\u2019s government?\u201d Steffen asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile your feelings are sweet, My Queen, they are perhaps too idealistic,\u201d Gerhart said with a charming smile, although his eyes had the look of a viper in them. \u201cIf the royal family is not working to direct the country, it will fall into ruin. While people tend to overestimate Elise\u2019s role in the country, I am forced to admit that she does fill a necessary function.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetling, are you alright?\u201d Falk murmured to Elise, who was leaning back in her chair.</p><p>Elise stared wide-eyed at her plate, hearing the conversation but not able to respond. It was nice to know that Clotilde had managed to bring the royal siblings together\u2014Gerhart and Mikk never would have spoken on Elise\u2019s behalf if they didn\u2019t hate Clotilde just as much as everyone else in Brandis.</p><p>Even so, Elise\u2019s heart heaved in her chest.</p><p>Clotilde was going to do everything she could to get rid of her, and her foster brothers wouldn\u2019t always be around to protect her. One day Clotilde would succeed, and all of Elise\u2019s work, everything she did to prove she was even a little bit worthy of the honor King Henrik and Queen Ingrid had bestowed upon her would be wasted.</p><p>Queen Clotilde shook her head and fixed a poisonous smile on her lips. \u201cThe bottom line is that as her foster parents, it is up to Henrik and I to decide what is best for her. Henrik, you must believe that I have the best interests of Arcainia and Elise at mind. We will announce her availability\u2014,\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Clotilde twisted her neck to stare at King Henrik. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Elise will not yet marry. Nor will I see her cut from this family,\u201d King Henrik said. His voice held a hint of the rough iron and rock that he used to possess...before he met Clotilde.</p><p>\u201cHenrik, dear, you must trust me. As a man you do not understand, but as a woman and her foster mother I\u2014,\u201d</p><p>\u201cElise\u2019s foster mother is Queen Ingrid. You have unfortunately inherited my rowdy sons, but Elise is Ingrid\u2019s legacy. She is F\u00fcrstin, the head of her own household. She may marry if she wishes, but no one in this family will ever force her to,\u201d King Henrik said.</p> <p>Everyone at the table was silent.</p><p>Elise\u2019s foster brothers stared at their father with something like hope, and Elise bit the inside of her cheek to keep from crying as she raised her eyes to meet King Henrik\u2019s eyes.</p><p>They were clear and heavy with...expectation.</p><p>Elise looked to Clotilde, who was gawking at King Henrik as if she had never seen him before. When she turned to look at the rest of the royal children, her eyes zeroed in on Elise. Her lip curled back in a sneer, and she clenched her crystal wine glass so tightly, she made it crack.</p><p>\u201cDove, your glass has cracked\u2014careful now. I wouldn\u2019t want to see your beautiful skin marred. Serving maid, would you procure a new glass for the queen? Thank you,\u201d King Henrik said, his moment of steel and steadiness gone. His voice and mannerisms were back to their doddering ways.</p> <p>Clotilde did not respond to Henrik, and she kept her eyes on Elise.</p><p>The matter wasn\u2019t over yet. Clotilde would not take a loss.</p><p>A few weeks before summer, the royal princes and princesses of Arcainia assembled outside the throne room.</p><p>\u201cDoes anyone know what they wish to speak to us about?\u201d Erick asked, adjusting his rectangular glasses.</p><p>\u201cNot a clue,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>\u201cMy agents haven\u2019t uncovered anything unusual,\u201d Mikk said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be pretty, that\u2019s for certain. We\u2019re being summoned for a formal audience with all the bells and whistles,\u201d Rune said, adjusting his circlet. In spite of the \u201ctiaras,\u201d everyone still wore their everyday uniforms in the Arcainian colors of black and gold.</p><p>\u201cErick, any word on a magic user coming to scent that creature out?\u201d Steffen said, nodding his head in the direction of the throne room.</p><p>\u201cFunny you should say that. Directly before I was summoned here, I received a note from an enchantress of some renown. She said she would be traveling through Arcainia and would be happy to help so long as we did not require the use of magic,\u201d Erick said. \u201cI left her a message directing her to Brandis. With luck, she should arrive within the week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA week may be too late,\u201d Gerhart groaned, flinging an arm over his eyes. \u201cIf I have to listen to her complain another day about our lack of decorum and formality I\u2019m going to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not something to joke about, Gerhart,\u201d Falk said, his voice soft like velvet but seeped with warning.</p><p>\u201cAll we need to do is concentrate on getting through today,\u201d Gabrielle said, holding her black and white, male cat in her arms. (Elise didn\u2019t know why she brought the cat, but in the past month it was increasingly rare to see Gabrielle without it.) \u201cHow are you holding up?\u201d Rune asked, slinging an arm across Elise\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m managing,\u201d Elise smiled. Ever since King Henrik beheaded Clotilde\u2019s plan to marry her off, the young queen took great pains to snub, mock, and rebuke Elise. \u201cI don\u2019t see how this will end well, even with the help of an enchantress,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cIf we can prove she is using magic, the Veneno Conclave will be forced to step in, Darling,\u201d Falk said, intruding on the conversation without hesitation.</p> <p>\u201cNext time I leave to fight a monster, you should come with me. You could use the break,\u201d Rune said.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. I cannot afford to leave the treasury alone for long. Nick increased security around the vault, but Clotilde still tries to bully her way in,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a wonder she hasn\u2019t convinced Father to force you to give her permission to enter it,\u201d Rune said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it isn\u2019t,\u201d Falk said. \u201cAs manipulative as she may be, Clotilde does not strike me as being especially bright.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s smart enough to try and squeeze us out of the government system,\u201d Rune said.</p><p>\u201cBut she goes about it in the most brutish ways. Subtlety is not her gift,\u201d Falk said.</p><p>\u201cSometimes one doesn\u2019t need to be subtle if they can get their way through force,\u201d Elise grimly said.</p><p>\u201cIs everyone ready to enter?\u201d Steffen asked. He held Gabrielle\u2019s elbow as she needed both hands to support her unusually large cat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After hearing a chorus of yeses, Steffen turned to the doorman. \u201cArthur, we are ready to face the dragon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck to you, Your Majesties,\u201d the doorman said, hastily crossing himself before he swung open a door and announced, \u201cTheir majesties Kronprinz Steffen and Prinzessin Gabrielle, Prinz Mikkael, Prinz Nickolas, Prinz Falk, F\u00fcrstin Elise, and Prinz Gerhart.\u201d</p><p>Elise and her siblings approached the dais that King Henrik and Queen Clotilde\u2019s thrones were placed on.</p><p>They were silent, exchanging nervous glances when they saw their father. He was slumped in his chair like an old man. His eyes were vacant, his breathing labored, and he did nothing to acknowledge their entrance.</p> <p>Queen Clotilde wore her most expensive dress. Her jewelry was a set of sparkling diamonds, and her facial features were drawn and snake like as she smiled magnificently.</p><p>\u201cChildren,\u201d she said, standing when the door closed. \u201cHow good of you to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what did you request our presence, My Queen?\u201d Steffen asked.</p><p>Clotilde clasped her hands. \u201cYou all have been such a pain,\u201d she started. \u201cAgain and again, I have tried to push you out. But you all resist. Worse yet, you make him resist,\u201d she said, jerking her head back at King Henrik.</p><p>Mikk, Nick, and Rune slide their swords out of their scabbards, holding them warily in front of them.</p> <p>Gabrielle\u2019s cat hissed, his fur standing on end as he growled at the queen.</p><p>\u201cThere simply is no other option,\u201d Clotilde said. \u201cI have to kill you.\u201d</p><p>Rune sprinted up the stairs, Mikk and Nick on his heels. He raised his sword and leaped at Clotilde as if to chop her when he hit a iridescent surface\u2014much like a translucent egg shell\u2014and was thrown backwards.</p><p>Mikk and Nick tried to stab their swords through the protective barrier, but they, too, were thrown like rag dolls.</p><p>\u201cSo you finally show your true colors?\u201d Erick said, sliding a dagger out of his uniform as Elise and Falk scrambled to check on the fallen trio.</p><p>\u201cHold your tongue, you fool,\u201d Clotilde said. \u201cYou will die without honor.\u201d</p> <p>Gerhart ran for the door. He tried to wrench it open but it wouldn\u2019t budge. \u201cArthur! Arthur, open the door!\u201d he shouted, pounding on it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no use. I have sealed this room. You will not escape,\u201d Clotilde said.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t get away with this. The people will revolt. It will be obvious you killed us,\u201d Steffen said.</p><p>\u201cIf I kill you when you are human, yes. But not if I curse you first,\u201d Clotilde said with an evil smile as she slipped a hand into a black silk bag. \u201cA swan will do nicely. I\u2019ve always hated those birds. They are too beautiful and pure. It will be wonderfully ironic, of course, as your family crest is a swan. Maybe I\u2019ll make you all into a cloak.\u201d</p><p>Erick tried throwing his dagger. It made the shield of magic Clotilde used to protect herself crack and fizzle, and it lodged in the surface, but it was not able to pass through.</p><p>Clotilde pulled something out of the bag and clasped it in her hands before starting the spell. As Clotilde spoke in a deep, eerie voice unlike her own, Rune, Mikk, and Nick recovered and tried to attack again. They hit the magical shield and again bounced off it.</p><p>Clotilde ignored them and spoke in a dark, guttural language Elise didn\u2019t recognize.</p><p>\u201cPuss, do something,\u201d Gabrielle said.</p> <p>Steffen unearthed several daggers and threw them at Clotilde. They bounced off the surface of her shield, unlike Erick\u2019s, and fell to the ground with a clatter.</p><p>\u201cArthur!\u201d Gerhart shouted, pounding on the door as dark fog filled the room.</p><p>Falk ran up the stairs, making a beeline for King Henrik. \u201cFather,\u201d he shouted when he could get no closer. \u201cFather! Wake up!\u201d</p><p>Clotilde\u2019s voice increased in volume until it made the air and floor shake. She held her hands up with a flourish, still clutching something in one fist, and shouted. \u201cNow, I curse you, princes and princesses of Arcainia. I curse you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabrielle, hold on!\u201d shouted a voice Elise didn\u2019t recognize.</p><p>\u201cBut Steffen\u2014,\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t do him any good if you\u2019re both swans!\u201d</p><p>The magic hit Elise and her siblings like a wave of black water. It struck Steffen first, coating his body in black liquid. A black cloud formed around him and started shrinking. Inside the cloud, Steffen yelled. His voice turned wild and the cloud shattered with an explosion of white feathers.</p><p>Mikk and Nick were next. They braced each other and tried to stab their swords through the black magic, but it engulfed them. Elise could hear the clang of their swords falling to the ground as they, too, screamed.</p><p>Erick held his hand out in front of him and said words Elise suspected were part of the language of magic, but the wave of black filth did not flinch backwards and enveloped him as well.</p><p>Falk and Rune were only seconds behind, their screams adding to the cacophony of the air.</p><p>A cloud formed around Gabrielle, but it did not shrink.

Elise choked as she felt the curse tighten around her and fight its way to her bones.</p><p>Clotilde was going to win.</p><p>All would be lost. Not just her family, but Arcainia as well.</p> <p>Clotilde, the witch, would ruin it. The servants, her Treasury Department staff, the kind stable hands and the brave soldiers. All would be ruled by a tyrant who was bent on their destruction.</p><p>\u201cNO!\u201d Elise shouted. Her rebuke was drowned out by the tarry magic, but after she choked it out, the curse froze.</p><p>\u201cNO!\u201d Elise repeated. The curse retreated from her mouth and inner body with enough suddenness to make Elise wretch, but she held it in. \u201cNo! I will not accept this!\u201d Elise shouted.</p><p>The black magic fled from her. It zoomed back to Clotilde and hit her square in the chest. The woman shrieked and fell backwards, cracking her head on her wooden throne.</p><p>Elise stared wide eyed at the flock of white swans who beat their wings and trumpeted before she raised her gaze to the fallen queen, who was tussling with the curse that had fled from Elise.</p> <p>\u201cElise, RUN! Now, while she\u2019s distracted,\u201d Gabrielle shouted, wrenching Elise along by the arm. They reached the door and threw themselves against it. Gabrielle narrowly avoided squashing her cat against its surface, but the door flew open.</p><p>\u201cPuss, help us get the princes out,\u201d Gabrielle said, dropping her cat.</p><p>\u201cHurry! I don\u2019t think that curse will fight her much longer,\u201d the cat said\u2014the cat said\u2014as he ran behind several swans/princes, hissing and swiping at them with his claws.</p><p>\u201cWhat the\u2014,\u201d Arthur started as Elise shooed the last of the swans out of the throne room.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask. Close the door and keep it shut as long as you can manage, even if Clotilde orders you to open it,\u201d Gabrielle instructed.</p><p>\u201cWhere do we take them?\u201d Elise asked as they herded the swans down the hallway.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to leave the country. Clotilde won\u2019t rest until you\u2019re all killed,\u201d Gabrielle said when they reached a staircase. \u201cGET A HORSE. NOW!\u201d she shouted to servants at the bottom of the stairs.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you coming with? You won\u2019t be safe either,\u201d Elise said as the swans bumbled their way down the staircase.</p><p>Gabrielle stopped at the base of the stairs, and for a moment Elise could see how frightened Gabrielle was.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. I promised him,\u201d Gabrielle said, placing a hand over her heart and clenching the fabric of her dress. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ll have Puss with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. You\u2019ll have me with you. I\u2019m going to tan your hide if you ever move out of clawing range again,\u201d Gabrielle\u2019s cat said. (The cat said. Elise suspected she would have to take a serious amount of time to processes this once she and her brothers reached safety.) \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d a servant asked.</p><p>\u201cI will explain later. For now we must get these swans out of the castle, before the Queen finds us,\u201d Gabrielle said.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d several servants said, moving in to help herd the swans to a servant\u2019s exit.</p><p>\u201cElise,\u201d Gabrielle said. \u201cFollow your brothers, and do not let them rest until you have left the country. Go south, if you can, but concern yourself foremost with tracking your brothers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI cannot do this alone. I can hardly keep seven swans safe\u2014,\u201d Elise started.</p><p>\u201cElise,\u201d Gabrielle said, grabbing Elise by the shoulders. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you avoided the curse, but it is abundantly clear that you are the only chance your brothers have. You cannot second guess yourself. You must guard them.\u201d</p><p>Elise glanced at her swan brothers. She couldn\u2019t tell them apart. All of them were graceful white birds that were shockingly quiet. Elise didn\u2019t know if Gabrielle was right, but she couldn\u2019t leave her brothers now. Arcainia wouldn\u2019t survive without them, and Elise owed it to the royal family. \u201cAlright,\u201d she said.</p><p>Gabrielle spared Elise a weak smile before they hustled out of the servant\u2019s entrance/exit to Brandis. \u201cSteffen,\u201d Gabrielle called, wading through the birds.</p><p>Elise didn\u2019t know how she did it, but Gabrielle sought out a very specific bird and held its head.</p><p>\u201cSteffen, I don\u2019t know if you understand me, but please remember this. I love you. I love you so much. I\u2019m going to stay here. If I loved you any less, I would come, but I cannot. I will keep our people safe, and I will do my best to make Clotilde\u2019s life miserable. Please be safe. Do not forget me,\u201d Gabrielle begged. Tears fell from her eyes before she awkwardly embraced the large swan.</p><p>The swan was still\u2014it was the only swan that was motionless, the others kept flapping their wings and pecking each other. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The castle shook and Gabrielle\u2019s cat ran back to the castle. \u201cGabrielle,\u201d it called in an impatient voice.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Gabrielle said.

When Elise saw the horse, she swore several times, making her assistant swan keepers/servants stared wide eyed at her.</p><p>It was Falk\u2019s horse, a spirited beast that shied easily and ran like hellhounds chased him on his mild days.</p><p>Something deep in the castle roared. \u201cNo other choice,\u201d Elise grimly said, throwing herself into the saddle.</p><p>The horse shied, but Elise clamped herself to its back like a flea. \u201cGo, go, fly, brothers!\u201d Elise urged as the horse ran straight into the swan flock.</p><p>The swans beat their wings and clumsily took flight. They fought their way into the air, crashing into each other like drunken sailors.</p> <p>Elise heeled Falk\u2019s horse, and the beast took off, careening out of Castle Brandis and entering the city. \u201cLook out!\u201d Elise shouted as they galloped down city streets.</p><p>Men, women, and children leaped out of the way, and Elise didn\u2019t try to slow the horse down. Instead, she cast nervous glances to the sky, watching for the flock of swans.</p><p>They left the capital, bearing west.</p><p>When Elise cleared the gates, she loosened the reins. Falk\u2019s horse threw himself into a frenzied gallop. Elise tangled one hand in his mane and clamped onto the saddle with her other hand.</p><p>The land to the west of Brandis was, mercifully, free of trees. It made it easier to watch her brothers, but it also made Elise an open target.</p><p>After ten minutes of flying, several of the white swans started to sink. Their flight was labored, and they strained their graceful necks forward when they pumped their wings.</p> <p>Falk\u2019s horse had worked up a sweat, so Elise pulled him back into a trot. They lagged behind the swans, which flew closer and closer to the ground.</p><p>When the first swan crash-landed\u2014rolling when he failed to slow down before touching the ground\u2014Elise slide off the horse\u2019s back and led him up to the flock as the rest of the swans tried landing, having roughly the same amount of success as the first swan.</p><p>\u201cWe have to keep moving. If you can\u2019t fly, you have to walk,\u201d Elise said, nudging the swans forward.</p><p>The swans walked more gracefully than they flew, although the pace left much to be desired. They almost glided when they walked, their backs and shoulders barely moving up and down.</p><p>\u201cFaster than this, brothers. Please, if you can understand me, walk faster,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>They didn\u2019t walk faster.</p><p>Elise clamped down on the knot in her throat and the tears stinging her eyes. \u201cCome on, birds,\u201d Elise said as she used herself and the horse to force the swans to march forward.</p><p>Their black webbed feet padded the ground as they picked up their pace, occasionally stopping to hiss at Elise as she rushed them.</p> <p>After five to ten minutes of waddling, Elise glanced back at Castle Brandis.</p><p>A black cloud hung around the tallest tower of the palace. There were flashes of red light that occasionally lit up the innards of the cloud.</p><p>\u201cFly, brothers. FLY,\u201d Elise shouted, throwing herself on Falk\u2019s horse before directing the animal to plow through the flock.</p><p>The birds resentfully took to the air, hissing and clicking at Elise as they took off, clumsily pumping their wings to gain altitude.</p><p>Elise again clamped onto the horse, her muscles protesting with the stiffness and tension she held the position in. She risked a glance over her shoulder and wished she hadn\u2019t. The cloud left Castle Brandis and was creeping in their direction. Instead of floating like a normal cloud, the black fog bobbed like a cork on rough waters. It rolled downwards before winding up, cresting like an ocean wave.</p><p>A forest was within sight. If Elise could reach it, with her brothers, before the cloud found them they might have a chance.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d Elise shouted when one of the birds started to sink.</p><p>The swan hastily pumped its wings, knocking into one of the other swans.</p><p>Elise\u2019s foster brothers squabbled in the air as Elise and the horse thundered along the ground.</p><p>The cloud was maybe two to three stone throws away when Elise and the swans reached the edge of the forest.</p><p>The swans dropped like rocks, shaking dust from their white feathers when they stood and beat their wings. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cKeep going in!\u201d Elise said, sliding off her mount\u2019s back. The horse threw his head and shied, the whites of his eyes showing when he got a look at the incoming cloud.</p><p>\u201cCurse you, Falk, and your competitive streak,\u201d Elise said, wincing when the reins burned her fingers as the horse reared. Elise ground her teeth and clung to the reins, pulling the horse forward. He snorted and jumped ahead, making the swans hurry down the dirt road that plowed through the forest.</p><p>They were within the borders of the woods when Elise took another moment to look back. \u201cIt\u2019s not stopping,\u201d she said, able to see the incoming cloud through the opening in the forest.</p><p>Fear made Elise\u2019s heart pump. She dragged the nervous horse around the flock, pressuring her swan brothers off the road. \u201cOff the trail,\u201d she called, whistling at them to get their attention.</p> <p>The swans were quiet as they waddled off the path and into green underbrush.</p><p>There was a thundering noise, like the roar of the ocean. Elise whirled around. The black fog was in the forest, creeping forward like searching fingers.</p><p>It drew parallel with Elise and the swans when the ocean noises grew louder.</p><p>Someone shouted, and a whirling black-blue shape topped with white gold flew past like a comet, plunging at the fog.</p><p>The fog fled the comet, escaping faster than it had pursued Elise. The comet caught up with the fog though, and the black cloud huddled to a frightening tar-like core before the comet hit it, shattering it entirely.</p> <p>There was a deafening peal of thunder, but no lightning.</p><p>Falk\u2019s horse reared again, swinging wildly around and crashing into a bush as the swans beat their wings.</p><p>By the time Elise was able to hold her borrowed horse steady, the \u201ccomet\u201d stood in the middle of the trail, in line with Elise and her flock.</p><p>The comet was actual a breathtakingly beautiful lady mounted on a black horse. Elise hesitated to call it a horse, for while the animal had the structure and face of a horse, its fur wasn\u2019t quite fur. Instead the horse appeared to be wrapped by the night sky. Its body was mostly blue black with the faint twinkling of stars, and its mane and tail were black as well, although they didn\u2019t fall and sit straight the way normal hair would. Instead they floated, looking more like tongues of black and blue fire than strands of hair.</p><p>\u201cYou certainly aren\u2019t Gabi, so Princess Elise I may presume?\u201d the rider asked.</p><p>Elise swallowed as she stared at the great beauty. As she watched the rider\u2019s dress, an iridescent shade of gold, turned a faint shade of iridescent green. \u201cW-who are you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am Angelique.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an enchantress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect. Your brother, Prince Erick, invited me to Arcainia. He asked me to observe your stepmother. It seems that I am too late,\u201d Angelique said, looking past Elise to the white swans huddled behind her. \u201cIt is alright, princes. Please, come out of hiding,\u201d Angelique said, her voice soothing and tranquil.</p><p>Elise\u2019s seven swan brothers glided out of the forest, joining Angelique on the road as the enchantress dismounted.</p><p>Angelique slid her hands under the head of one of the swans, making it look up at her. She studied its face as she gently stroked it, murmuring to it under her breath.</p><p>Elise waded out of the trees, dragging Falk\u2019s horse with, and watched. Falk\u2019s horse snorted at the enchantress\u2019s odd mount, but he did nothing more besides watch it with bugged eyes.</p><p>Angelique slowly turned the head of the swan that attended to her, studying the sides of its face. \u201cThis is a serious curse,\u201d Angelique said. Even the frown that twitched across her lips could not mar her beauty. \u201cI assume Gabi escaped it because of Puss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPuss?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHer cat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. She wasn\u2019t cursed, I don\u2019t know why though,\u201d Elise said scrubbing her face with a dirty hand.</p><p>\u201cAnd how did you remain unhindered?\u201d Angelique asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. Clotilde tried to curse me, but it bounced off me and went back to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow very odd.\u201d</p><p>Elise hesitated. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m not a real member of the royal family. I am a foster child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnlikely. This curse was not crafted specifically for the royal family, and it was made with black magic. Anyone who took the time to create such a vile curse would not make a beginner\u2019s mistake,\u201d Angelique said, releasing the swan.</p><p>Elise crouched on the ground, covering her head with an arm as she thought. \u201cCan it be broken?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there any way to end this curse? Could we make Clotilde take it off them? Or... if she dies?\u201d</p><p>Angelique stared at the swans for several long moments before she replied. \u201cThe safest place for you and your brothers is to be far away from Clotilde. As for breaking the curse...I will see what can be done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will approach Clotilde.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if she attacks you?\u201d</p><p>Angelique was silent for several moments. \u201cThere will be no if, for I plan to attack her first.\u201d</p><p>Elise looked up at the breathtaking woman. \u201cWill you be punished for it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I would pardon you, the royal family would pardon you if we could,\u201d Elise said as one of the swans waddled up to her and started tugging on her hair with its orange beak.</p><p>\u201cI thank you. But it is not the Arcainian government that outlawed magic in Arcainia, but the Veneno Conclave itself. There is a good chance I will not be punished as the attacks originate from a twister of magic. However, no matter who made the law, I would not stand for this. My master taught me that as a magic user it is my responsibility to right whatever wrongs might have been made with magic. What Clotilde has done is not only wrong, but evil,\u201d Angelique said.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Elise said, her words barely louder than a whisper. The swan pecking at her hair whistled at her, drawing a weak smile from Elise.</p> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Angelique said before she turned back to her horse. It bowed in an odd, boneless movement, letting Angelique climb up its leg and onto its back. \u201cYou must leave the country. Keep going west to Loire, and from there go north to Verglas. Your stepmother could never touch you there, for the magic of the Snow Queen still runs strong in Verglas in spite of the centuries that have passed. I mean to find Gabi and Puss to form a plan for attacking the queen. It may be some days before I find you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Enchantress, please...can my brothers understand me at all?\u201d Elise asked, standing.</p><p>\u201cThey understand more than you would think, but not much of their humanity remains. I would guess that they recognize you as someone important to them, although they certainly do not understand the conversation we just had,\u201d Angelique said.</p><p>\u201cI see. Thank you,\u201d Elise said, pushing her shoulders back.</p><p>\u201cThey will stay close to you. Do not worry that they will fly off. It will be easy for you to reach Verglas if you lead them rather than attempt to drive them, I think,\u201d Angelique said, smoothing her iridescent skirts into place.</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Elise repeated, biting the inside of her lip to keep her face stoic.</p><p>\u201cI will find you after my encounter with your step-mother. Until then, stay safe,\u201d Angelique said. When her horse snorted, his nostrils flared red, like coals.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Lady Enchantress. My family owes you a great debt,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cHardly. It is the fault of magic users for allowing this to happen in the first place, but I thank you all the same. Until Verglas, Princess Elise,\u201d Angelique said before clicking to her horse.</p><p>It started off at a swift, ground-covering trot, but its footfalls sounded odd on the dirt road.</p><p>Falk\u2019s horse snorted at the unusual animal, and Elise patted its neck. \u201cI know how you feel. Come, we must keep moving.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter 4</p><p>All day Elise walked, leading one horse and seven swans on foot. The second day she mostly walked, but occasionally rode when she was able to coax her brothers into flying. It was the same on the third day.</p><p>Elise lost track of the days after that. She was tired and uncomfortable. She slept on the ground and ate the few edible plants she recognized. She knew she didn\u2019t eat enough, but her appetite was gone.</p><p>The more time she spent with her swan brothers, the heavier her heart grew. She tried to look for any quirks or hints of their personalities that would set them apart. If she could just figure out which brother was which bird! But no; they operated like a flock of silent, dumb birds.</p><p>Elise\u2019s only comfort was at night, when she tried to sleep on the hard ground and was surrounded by the soft, pillowy bodies of seven swans.</p><p>When Elise reached the Loire/Verglas border\u2014and she knew it was the border, because Verglas had a distinctly cooler climate and an abundance of pine trees that Loire did not possess\u2014 her work uniform was torn, dirty, and a general disgrace to look at.</p><p>An hour more of traveling, and Elise found a large pond that seemed a suitable enough place at which to wait for Angelique.</p><p>It was scummy with lily pads and algae floating on the still surface, but Elise\u2019s foster brothers happily plunged into the pond and started dunking their heads in the water, dining on some sort of pond weed.</p> <p>Elise unbuckled the bit and reins from the bridle of her mount and removed its saddle and blanket. She let it loose in a small meadow where it attacked the grass with scarcely less zeal than the swans sifting in the pond.</p><p>Elise spread the saddle blanket on the ground before she sat down, inspecting the frayed hem of her skirt. The gold key still hung from the red sash tied around her waist, but the white sleeves were smeared green, and the black of the skirts had become a dark shade of mud gray.</p><p>One of the swans left the pond and chased an insect around the shore. The insect buzzed close to Elise, drawing the swan to her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The swan flapped its wings, launching itself at Elise. It caught the bug, but it smacked Elise in the face with its powerful wings that had the force of a swinging sack of potatoes.</p><p>\u201cOuch, go away,\u201d Elise said, her eyes watering with pain as she tried to push the swan off.</p><p>The swan chortled and smacked her again with its wings as it left, retreating to the pond.</p><p>\u201cPlease, please let the Lady Enchantress Angelique succeed in overthrowing Clotilde,\u201d Elise said, holding her throbbing nose.</p> <p>Surrounded only by animals, nothing answered her.</p><p>Elise rubbed down Falk\u2019s horse with bit of cloth she ripped off her black skirt and dipped in the pond.</p><p>Her swan brothers floated on the water or puttered around on the shore, looking for bugs and grass to eat.</p><p>One swan sat near Elise and the horse, watching them with a tilted head.</p><p>Elise offered the swan a smile. \u201cRune?\u201d she tried.</p> <p>The swan didn\u2019t move.</p><p>Elise glanced at the horse and then back to the swan. \u201cFalk? Do you recognize your horse?\u201d</p><p>The swan lunged to its black feet, snapping a bug midair. It chortled to itself before it went back to the pond, drawing a sigh from Elise.</p><p>It had been a week, and her brothers still acted like swans. Sometimes she thought one of them might be responding, but it always was because there was a bug buzzing through the air, or they were watching because they were looking at a nearby animal.</p><p>Elise wanted to believe that as she was a part of their family\u2014foster child or not\u2014she might be able to stir their memories.</p><p>She was having no such luck. She hadn\u2019t even identified Rune, and he was the Royal Prince she was closest to.</p> <p>Another swan approached Elise.</p><p>Elise smiled and extended a hand.</p><p>The swan pecked her, pinching and twisting the soft skin on her wrist.</p><p>Elise yelped. The swan flapped its wings and moved on, which was a good thing as Elise burned with the desire to kick the white bird. Instead, she clamped a hand over her smarting skin and stared up at the sky.</p><p>A raindrop fell on her face. Seconds later, another fat droplet plopped on her nose.</p><p>When it started to downpour, Elise breathed in through her nose, carefully gathering up her craving to bawl and strangling it.</p><p>A princess didn\u2019t cry. At least, Queen Ingrid wouldn\u2019t have. The Queen would expect Elise to be better than hysterics, as well.</p><p>Elise headed for the trees, dragging Falk\u2019s horse by its bridle-turned-halter. A few of the swans joined her long enough to ram into her and hit her with their wings before they returned to the pond, unbothered by the water that slid off their slick feathers.</p> <p>\u201cIf Angelique doesn\u2019t succeed, I will have to do something,\u201d Elise said. \u201cClotilde might get her wish after all; I might have to marry a foreign prince in order to mobilize his troops to rescue my country.\u201d</p><p>The prospect of marrying a foreign dignitary did not delight Elise. She always knew that her Father wouldn\u2019t thoughtlessly auction her off to allies. He would keep her in the country, hopefully letting her wed her choice of men. Preferably she would marry Mertein\u2014who was a good choice as the first son of a prominent noble family. It was the greatest happily ever after Elise could have dared to dream for, and she did.</p><p>But now, watching her brothers\u2014watching the swans really\u2014Elise knew if anyone was going to save Arcainia and get rid of Clotilde, it would have to be her.</p><p>\u201cLucien is a toad,\u201d Elise said, thinking of the crown prince of Loire. \u201cBut if he is still open to a marriage contract, he may be my best bet.\u201d</p><p>Rain continued to fall, filling the air with a steady pitter patting as it fell against tree leaves and the ground.</p><p>A swan hissed when another swan pecked it, and Elise closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI will marry for the sake of Arcainia, for Father, and for my foster brothers if I must,\u201d she said. \u201cI just wish...,\u201d Elise trailed off, unable to finish the thought. She watched the rain fall and thought longingly of the sweet moments she shared with Mertein.</p><p>It was dusk. Several more days had passed, and as each day turned into the next, Elise steeled her resolve. It didn\u2019t seem like Angelique, the Lady Enchantress, would be returning.</p><p>Elise watched the swans float on the pond, bobbing up and down in the ripples colored by the last rays of the sun. They looked beautiful, the rising moon made their stark white feathers glow as they arched their necks and paddled in the water.</p><p>\u201cAnother week, maybe two. If I don\u2019t hear from Angelique before then, I will know something must have gone terribly wrong,\u201d Elise said, resting her head on her knees as she sat on the sandy bank that bordered the pond.</p><p>One of the swans made a strange, questioning noise.</p><p>Elise looked up to see the swan peck at the churning water surface. There was no wind, but waves crested in the pond as if it were part of the ocean. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Two swans clicked in protest when the water tossed them around, and all of the swans hissed when light that was golden and strong\u2014more like the rising sun than the silver moon that hung in the dark sky\u2014surrounded them. It pulled the swans into the air, making them hang with their wings stretched.</p><p>Elise stared wide eyed, scrambling to her feet when a pillar of white feathers exploded around each swan.</p><p>There was a trumpeting noise that resounded off nearby trees, and the light disappeared. The feathers seemed to solidify, encasing the seven humans that stood in the pond where seven swans previously paddled.</p><p>\u201cGross, I think I have a bug in my teeth!\u201d Gerhart said.</p> <p>\u201cThis is certainly what I aspired to do with my life, float in on a pond before getting dosed all the way through my breeches,\u201d Steffen grumbled as he trudged out of the pond, shaking water off as he went.</p><p>Elise stared as each of her brothers emerged from the pond, wearing white clothes that seemed to have the same slick properties as swan feathers.</p><p>\u201cElise, you\u2019re safe,\u201d Rune said, the first of his brothers to approach her. He bent over her, picking her off the ground and wrapping his arms around her in a tight hug.</p><p>The gesture convinced Elise she was not delusional. He was real. Her face was pressed against his soft shirt, and his hands were warm on her back.</p><p>Her brothers were human again.</p> <p>\u201cRune,\u201d Elise said, grasping at his shirt as if he were her anchor. It was all she could say, her throat burned with unsaid words, but her mouth wouldn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, Elise. Everything is going to be fine,\u201d Rune said.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s enough,\u201d Nick said, wrenching the two apart after several prolonged moments.</p><p>Elise clenched her jaw to keep her teeth from chattering as she drank in the sight of her foster brothers.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry, Elise, that it was my horse you had to ride here,\u201d Falk said, placing a cool hand on the crown of Elise\u2019s head. \u201cI hope he was not too much trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked a lot of him, but he was a good mount,\u201d Elise said.</p> <p>\u201cGood. I am glad you are well,\u201d Falk said, awkwardly placing his hands on Elise\u2019s shoulders for a moment.</p><p>\u201cWhy we are in the middle of the forest?\u201d Mikk stiffly asked.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t remember getting cursed and turning into a bird? That\u2019s a real shame, Mikk. If we came across some swan ladies, I bet you would be real popular with them,\u201d Nick said, elbowing his twin.</p><p>\u201cClotilde cursed us. I could see her readying it, but I didn\u2019t have the chance to warn anyone,\u201d Erick said, reaching to adjust glasses that weren\u2019t there.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorely vexed by this. I was supposed to have tea with Lady Katchen,\u201d Gerhart said.</p><p>Erick blinked. \u201cWe have been turned into swans, and you are upset because you missed a tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d Gerhart grouched, folding his arms across his chest.</p><p>Elise tilted her head, intrigued. \u201cLady Katchen? Her family does a great deal of exporting. If they would agree to use the Carabas harbor to ship exports, it would be a great financial opportunity.\u201d</p> <p>Gerhart looked marginally pleased for a moment. \u201cOf course; why do you think I arranged to meet with her?\u201d he said before shoving his nose in the air.</p><p>Nick smacked Gerhart upside the head. \u201cOur little Gerhie is growing up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop that,\u201d Gerhart complained.</p><p>\u201cIs the curse broken?\u201d Steffen asked, inspecting his alien clothing.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. An enchantress, Angelique, said she would try attacking Clotilde to break it off. She must have succeeded,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cShe what?\u201d Gerhart gaped.</p><p>Erick narrowed her eyes. \u201cAngelique, you say? It would be a big gamble to use her magic in Arcainia, even if it is to protect us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will back her. With the curse broken, we can speak for her,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t be able to do that.\u201d</p><p>Elise and the princes of Arcainia whipped around.</p><p>Angelique was at the edge of the pond, mounted on her strange horse. She was a little mussed, but she looked darling and gorgeous instead of resembling a muddied street rat, as Elise suspected she did.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t manage to break the curse or off Clotilde,\u201d Angelique said, dismounting from her odd horse. The eerie creature shook its mane, and its black fur seemed to swirl in the moonlight.</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019re back to normal,\u201d Steffen said.</p><p>\u201cNot quite,\u201d Angelique said, tucking a stray strand of hair behind her ear. \u201cForgive me for my ill-timed introduction. I am Angelique.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is good to see you again, Lady Enchantress,\u201d Steffen said, taking Angelique\u2019s hand and bowing over it.</p><p>\u201cI echo my brother\u2019s sentiments,\u201d Erick said, smiling enigmatically. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Elise grasped the important part of the introduction. \u201cWhat do you mean not quite?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI laid a trap for Clotilde. Although I was able to attack her, I did not win. She is not very good with magic; in fact, she is quite bad at it,\u201d Angelique was silent for a moment, as if waiting for a wave of complaints. None of the Arcainian royals protested\u2014they had been brought up to mind their manners better than that. \u201cHowever,\u201d Angelique continued. \u201cShe has an impressive arsenal of premade curses. As a person, she is not strong\u2014she is barely above petty magics like temporary love charms. But she has gotten hold of some strong magical tools. They were what she used to curse you. There are two of them, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were unable to break the artifacts?\u201d Steffen asked.</p><p>Angelique shook her head. \u201cNo, I am afraid not. I did weaken the curse. I made a crack in it so you will be human for an hour every night when the sun sets, but that is the best I could manage.\u201d</p> <p>Steffen slowly nodded. Mikk and Nick moved to stand on either side of him like hulking bodyguards. \u201cI see. We thank you; it is more than we ever could have done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill we be like this forever?\u201d Gerhart asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Angelique said. \u201cAll hope is not lost. Clotilde can be defeated. I am too weak to defeat her on my own, but if I am joined by a colleague or two, we will be more than a match for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long will it take you to gain support for our situation?\u201d Falk asked.</p><p>Angelique pressed her lips together. Her eyes were sorrowful and heartbreaking. \u201cI am afraid it will be all summer, if not a year.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you excuse my manners, could you elaborate, Lady Enchantress?\u201d Gerhart asked, bowing when Angelique looked in his direction.</p><p>Angelique flipped her hair over one shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate, but the Veneno Conclave knows what I did. They have sent couriers after me, most likely with instructions to bring me before the council. I am not much worried by the prospect of a punishment, but it would be most...inconvenient for me at this time as most punishments involve several years of imprisonment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will have to run,\u201d Rune said, grappling for a moment when he discovered he had no sword belt to hook his thumbs on.</p><p>\u201cI can, and I will. I plan to go to Erlauf. I will return to Verglas when I am certain the Conclave is no longer looking for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill they give up on you so easily?\u201d Erick asked.</p><p>\u201cAs soon as another issue captures their attention, I will be forgotten. I merely need to outwait them. After my misdemeanor is forgiven, it will take time to find another enchanter or enchantress to aid me in fighting Clotilde.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo we will remain here while we wait? There isn\u2019t much we can do if we\u2019re human for one hour a night,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>\u201cWe cannot rally support outside Arcainia,\u201d Mikk said. \u201cWe are easy targets in our swan form.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we waste time, kicking up our heels and waiting?\u201d Gerhart asked.</p><p>\u201cSometimes inaction is the best course, little Gerhie,\u201d Erick said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that,\u201d Gerhart snarled.</p><p>\u201cI am forced to agree with Gerhart,\u201d Falk said, his voice quiet and shadowy. \u201cIt seems unwise to waste valuable months while Clotilde is raiding the castle. In our absence, she will have access to everything from the armies to the daily vault. With our Father enchanted as he is, she may even get into the treasury.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo she won\u2019t,\u201d Elise said. When her foster brothers swung around to stare at her. \u201cShe cannot get into the treasury,\u201d Elise said, picking the gold key that hung from her red sash and waggling it.</p><p>Steffen\u2019s face regained a hint of its usual humor. \u201cI forgot you always wear that. Well done, Elise. Clotilde\u2019s damage will be limited, at least, if she cannot get into the treasury. No magic user or locksmith can force their way inside it without the key. She cannot ruin the country if she does not have access to all our money.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStill, the less time we give Clotilde to scheme, the better,\u201d Mikk said.</p><p>\u201cWhat can we do? We can hardly expect Elise to escort us around as our bodyguard when we are swans,\u201d Rune said.</p><p>Angelique delicately cleared her throat. \u201cI assumed you would spend the summer breaking your curse,\u201d she said when the princes looked to her.</p><p>\u201cOur curse can be broken?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat must we do?\u201d</p><p>Angelique folded her hands in front of her and waited for the shouts to die down. \u201cIt will not be easy... Elise,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Nick blinked.</p><p>\u201cWhat does Elise have to do with our curse?\u201d Falk asked.</p><p>Rune curled an arm around Elise\u2019s shoulders, drawing her close to him.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, princes, you can do nothing to alter your current state. But Elise, if she is willing, can,\u201d Angelique said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow?\u201d Elise asked, slipping out of Rune\u2019s grasp to get closer to the enchantress.</p><p>Angelique held her finger tips of her right hand together and drew them through the air. The air condensed into a silvery mist before forming a long-stalked, leafy plant. \u201cThis is the stinging nettle,\u201d Angelique said, rotating the illusion in the air so Elise and the princes could see the sharp looking hairs that poked out of the stalk. \u201cBy sewing a great many of these plants into a covering of some sort, the curse can be broken.\u201d</p><p>\u201c...You must be joking,\u201d Falk said after several heartbeats of silence.</p><p>\u201cA cover\u2014a shirt would be best\u2014must be made individually. If you mean to free all your brothers, you must make seven shirts,\u201d Angelique continued.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not her brothers,\u201d Rune said automatically.</p><p>\u201cAdditionally, once you undertake this ambition, you cannot speak a word. If you make the shirts, all of those you have made up until the moment you spoke will be useless and will do nothing to break the curse,\u201d Angelique said.</p><p>\u201cDoes it have to be Elise?\u201d Gerhart asked. \u201cWhy can\u2019t any number of girls do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt must be one female who takes the burden upon herself, and it takes great strength of character to make the sacrifices that are called for breaking the curse. Do you know any women besides Elise who have the personal fortitude to stay silent for months, perhaps even a year?\u201d Angelique asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Gabi?\u201d Nick asked.</p> <p>Steffen laughed outright. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. Gabrielle couldn\u2019t keep her mouth shut for a minute, much less a month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabrielle is needed at Brandis,\u201d Angelique said.</p><p>Steffen grew stiff. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has a unique tool that will allow her to live side-by-side with Clotilde without any ill effects. She said she plans to remain behind at Brandis and see what she can do to protect Arcainia,\u201d Angelique said.</p><p>\u201cA tool?\u201d Nick said, interested.</p><p>\u201cWhat tool?\u201d Mikk asked.</p> <p>\u201cHer cat,\u201d Angelique said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is no matter,\u201d Steffen said, shrugging. \u201cIf Gabrielle stays behind at Brandis, it is just as well. She wouldn\u2019t be much use out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteffen, stop being a fool,\u201d Gerhart said, taking a step towards his eldest brother.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Rune said, placing his hand in front of him.</p><p>\u201cWhy not? He\u2019s being cruel and abusive to his wife, even if she is not here,\u201d Gerhart said. \u201cOut of all of us, I would have thought it would be you to correct him, Mr. Hero.\u201d</p><p>Rune leaned towards Gerhart and quietly said, \u201cHe is using his words to cover up his pain. Ignore it this one time,\u201d he advised.</p><p>\u201cMust I sew the shirts, or can I knit and weave the stalks of the stinging nettle to make them?\u201d Elise asked.</p> <p>\u201cKnitting or weaving would work just as well, but it will put your hands in much pain,\u201d Angelique said.</p><p>\u201cBut knitting would be faster,\u201d Elise persisted.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Angelique admitted. \u201cYou could use the stalk of the plant, or if you stomp on the stalks, you will find them to be fibrous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could this break our curse? The idea that shirts made of prickly plants could undo such a strong curse seems laughable,\u201d Erick said.</p><p>\u201cIf that is how you view it, yes, it is,\u201d Angelique said. \u201cHowever, you are using logic. Magic deals more with the matters of the heart. The curse Clotilde laid on you was constructed with a basis of hate. Because of her hatred for you, she twisted your lives and ruined you. Only a great sacrifice of love could counterbalance such evil. If Elise attempts to break your curse, she is lavishing more love upon the seven of you than the black hatred Clotilde set against you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnitting isn\u2019t a sacrifice of love,\u201d Gerhart said. \u201cOw!\u201d he muttered when Nick smacked him upside the head again.</p><p>\u201cThe fact that you say that reveals a great deal about your character, young prince,\u201d Angelique said. Her soft chiding made Gerhart blush and look away, but Angelique answered his question anyway. \u201cBy knitting shirts and remaining silent, Elise will essentially devote her life to you. Knitting with stinging nettles will be a painful process. If you will allow me to be frank, it is likely, Elise, that your hands will grow stiff and gnarled as a result of this process. They may never return to their normal levels of function. Additionally, remaining silent is no small feat. It will take a colossal amount of self-control. You may think the task sounds like child\u2019s play, but even I will admit I am hard pressed to think of more than a few situations where the task to break a curse required less dedication or love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElise, will you do it?\u201d Steffen asked.</p><p>\u201cAre you out of your mind?\u201d Rune asked. \u201cWe cannot ask her to do this. Not only will it be painful, but the dangers are numerous. We will be swans, and she will be voiceless in a country that is known for its assassin\u2019s guild.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe guild can\u2019t be that good. They failed to eliminate the second prince of Loire,\u201d Erick said.</p><p>\u201cThere is no reason for Elise to undertake this task,\u201d Falk said. \u201cIt is likely to take her a long time to perform this so-called sacrifice of love. The Lady Enchantress said she could return in a year. After finding a fellow magic user, they will eliminate Clotilde, and we will be free anyway. The wait would be a year at worst. I doubt you could knit seven shirts in that amount of time, don\u2019t you, Honeysuckle?\u201d Falk asked, once again using his mocking nicknames.</p><p>\u201cFour months. Possibly three,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>Her foster brothers blinked. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI could finish seven shirts in three to four months. It depends what condition my hands are in,\u201d Elise said, looking to the sky as she made the mental calculations.</p><p>\u201cYou already know how to knit?\u201d Mikk asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cYou only embroider, though. Father has forcibly shown me your work,\u201d Gerhart argued.</p><p>\u201cNow, I only embroider. When I was an orphan, I learned how to knit quite well,\u201d Elise said.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re still an orphan,\u201d Falk said.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d Elise said, gritting her teeth. \u201cJust because you refuse to acknowledge me, does not mean your parents did not deign to welcome me into your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElise, you don\u2019t have to do this. We can wait,\u201d Rune said, taking one of Elise\u2019s hands and lifting it to his lips.</p><p>\u201cWe cannot,\u201d Elise flatly said. \u201cThe country needs us. We must return to our posts, and I cannot stand to let that witch win for a moment more than necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElise,\u201d Rune said.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right. We\u2019re asking a lot of her, but the country needs us,\u201d Steffen said.</p> <p>\u201cYou expect too much from her, Steffen,\u201d Falk said. \u201cYou would not ask Gabrielle to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElise knows her duties,\u201d Mikk said.</p><p>Elise sighed and let the princes argue. It was better if they thought she did it only out of a sense of duty. The royal princes of Arcainia were already divided when it came to their differing beliefs regarding her. If they knew she undertook the curse only for them, they would probably start slugging each other.</p><p>The weeks Elise spent with swans\u2014beautiful but dumb birds\u2014terrified Elise. Ever since Queen Ingrid had selected her as a foster child, Elise had never been alone or unloved. Yes, the royal family hadn\u2019t fully embraced her, but during the days before Angelique arrived, Elise would have given anything just to hear Falk spit out another degrading nickname. That was how much she loved and missed them.</p><p>Elise jumped when Angelique laid her hand upon Elise\u2019s shoulder. \u201cThere is one small consolation I can give you,\u201d she said. \u201cFor the hour your brothers are human, you may speak. But only when they are human. If you utter a single word\u2014even if it is while they make the switch from swan to prince\u2014your work will be ruined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cYou will do it, then?\u201d Angelique said, ignoring the quarreling brothers.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBe careful. One of the princes mentioned the dangers of being voiceless and without human aid. He spoke the truth. Verglas is free of evil magic, but it has its share of bandits and brutes,\u201d Angelique warned.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be safer in another country?\u201d Elise asked.</p><p>Angelique shook her head, making her lovely hair sparkle in the moonlight. \u201cNo. Verglas is still safest. It offers you protection from Clotilde and any vile magic she may have up her sleeve. No evil or tainted magic can breech the borders of Verglas. It has been so for centuries.\u201d</p><p>Elise set her shoulders. \u201cThen we will remain here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suggest you travel east, and a little farther north. There is a bigger pond there that is more hospitable for humans. It also has a large number of stinging nettles in the forest that borders it,\u201d Angelique said.</p><p>\u201cI thank you for your wise council,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>Angelique snorted, looking more like a normal girl than a breathtaking beauty. \u201cIt is hardly wise. I circled it about five times when I couldn\u2019t find you. I had to release the weakened curse and watch which way it went.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand what you mean. The curse wasn\u2019t instantly weakened when you fought Clotilde?\u201d Elise asked.</p><p>\u201cIt was, but magic\u2014just like everything else\u2014takes time to cover distance. There\u2019s only one kind of magic that allows for instantaneous travel, and those able to wield such a power are rare. As such, the broken curse ambled along with me as I sought you out,\u201d Angelique explained.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t understand, but I shall take your word for it. Thank you, Lady Enchantress. You do not owe us your help, and I don\u2019t know if we will ever be able to repay you,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>Angelique offered Elise a smile that was flavored with sadness. \u201cI know what it is like to lose someone dear to you as the result of an enchantment. I am glad I can help you reclaim your father and foster brothers.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Elise bobbed in a curtsey. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Angelique tucked her hand under Elise\u2019s chin, forcing her to look into Angelique\u2019s eyes. \u201cThis is a burden they are placing on you, Princess. But I think you underestimate how important you are to them,\u201d Angelique trailed off and removed her hand from Elise\u2019s chin, thoughtfully looking at it.</p><p>\u201cLady Enchantress?\u201d Elise ventured.</p><p>Angelique shook herself. \u201cSomething to think about,\u201d she murmured before turning back to her horse. \u201cYou cannot wear your uniform. Arcainian work uniforms are impossible to miss, and it will mark you out in a country of cut-throats. Here are some clothes that will suit you better,\u201d Angelique said, retreating to her odd mount. She removed a burlap sack from a saddlebag and handed it over to Elise.</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Elise said, looking down at her ruined uniform. It was dirty, stained, and ripped beyond repair... but Elise was still pained at the thought of parting with it. It felt like she was giving up her position as department head.</p><p>\u201cWe thank you for your aid, Lady Enchantress. When this is all over, if there is anything we can do for you, please do not hesitate to call on us,\u201d Steffen said, exiting the family argument.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Angelique said as she climbed her way into the saddle. \u201cI wish you all luck. Be on your guard, but do not fear Clotilde. Evil can never win for long. Farewell,\u201d Angelique said.</p><p>Steffen and Elise, the only ones attending to the enchantress\u2019s exit, bowed and curtsied.</p><p>\u201cGood bye.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you, Lady Enchantress.\u201d</p><p>Angelique acknowledged their farewells with the flick of her hand as her night-sky mount carried her into the shadows of the forest. They disappeared from sight shortly after.</p><p>\u201cWhat will you do, Elise?\u201d Steffen asked.</p><p>\u201cBreak the curse, of course.\u201d</p><p>Steffen scuffed his foot in the sand. \u201cYou do not have to. I did not mean to imply you had no choice,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou are right; I don\u2019t have to,\u201d Elise said, turning to face Steffen. \u201cBut if I want our country to survive, if I want you all to survive, I must. And besides, as Mikk said, it is my duty.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know it\u2019s wonderfully responsible of you, but sometimes I wonder if you may be too dutiful,\u201d Steffen said.</p><p>Elise smiled. \u201cThat is hardly a fault.\u201d</p><p>Steffen returned the smile and embraced Elise. \u201cThank you, sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOi, where did the enchantress go? Ouch!\u201d Gerhart said when Nick smacked his back.</p><p>\u201cShe left. You\u2019re so unobservant, Gerhie,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>\u201cI said not to call me that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d Rune asked.</p><p>\u201cI believe that answer rests with Elise,\u201d Erick said, shifting his sharp eyes to her face.</p> <p>\u201cAngelique said we should move to a different pond. We can travel there tomorrow in the daylight, when you are all swans. I feel it would be wisest to stay here for the night,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so good about this new place?\u201d Gerhart asked, dodging another smack from Nick.</p><p>\u201cThe pond is larger, and Angelique mentioned it would be more hospitable for me. It also has more stinging nettles in the surrounding area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will try to break our curse?\u201d Mikk asked.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t try.

To think she\u2019d be right after all these years\u2014mind you, this isn\u2019t what I was picturing,\u201d Nick said, folding his arms behind his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Elise frowned.</p><p>Mikk elbowed Nick, and Steffen gave Elise one of his statesman smiles. \u201cNothing. He is merely overcome by gratitude for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally,\u201d Nick coughed.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Elise said, unconvinced.</p><p>\u201cI suspect we would better use our time as a human by planning for tomorrow, yes?\u201d Erick asked with a harmless smile.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Elise agreed.</p><p>\u201cWhat direction did Lady Angelique point you in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNorth east.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful.

She went first, riding Falk\u2019s horse, and the seven princes of Arcainia followed behind, walking on their black, webbed feet. They chortled and hissed, smacking each other and squabbling amongst themselves every step of the way. They followed Elise, however, with great determination, squawking and flapping their wings to catch up whenever they thought she rode too far ahead of them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Just as Angelique said, the new pond was better for their long-term needs. It was half the size of Castle Brandis, barely skirting being called a small lake. A piece of shore jutted towards the center of the pond, making it heart shaped. It was habited by a pair of wild geese, a flock of ducks, and dozens of croaking frogs and swimming fish.</p><p>The forest lay closer to one of the sandy shores, providing shelter for Elise. There was even a rock formation Elise could huddle against, and one of the rocks had a shelf that extended out, creating a roofed area for days of bad weather.</p><p>Elise stored the horse\u2019s tack there, as well as her tattered uniform after she changed into the drab, gray dress Angelique had provided.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve gone stocking foot since Queen Ingrid found me,\u201d Elise said to one of her swan brothers who watched her toss her slippers next to the horse tack. \u201cIt is a little liberating,\u201d she said, twirling once. The gray skirted dress, which fell a few inches below her knees, poofed up.</p> <p>Elise released the horse, and he grazed happily in the meadow that butted up to the pond. She took her gold key off her work uniform and shredded her red sash. Using the sash, she braided a long chain, which she slipped the key onto before she tied it around her neck and slid it under her plain dress.</p><p>When she was finished, she found several swans watching her. \u201cI may as well get started,\u201d she said when one of the swans rested its head on her bent knee. \u201cKnitting is what we\u2019re here for, after all,\u201d she said, stroking the swan\u2019s head before she stood and made her way to the forest.</p><p>Elise started by scavenging for twigs and thin branches she could use as makeshift knitting needles. It took her a while to find two branches that were the proper thickness she was looking for. They were dry, and the bark peeled cleanly off, but Elise was glad to see they did not break easily when she tried snapping them to make each branch the desired length.</p><p>Next Elise, sporting a gaggle of several swans paddling behind her, searched for stinging nettles. She didn\u2019t have to look very long before she found some in the forest. She inspected them, touching the plant stems, which prickled the soft skin of her fingers.</p><p>Elise dug up the plants by their roots. She gathered a large pile and carried them back to the pond where she stripped them of their leaves.</p> <p>Several times, Elise stopped to plunge her hands in the cool pond water, grimacing when the water stung the prickles left in her hands.</p><p>The skin on the top of her hands was red and splotchy by the time Elise got started on the first shirt in the late afternoon, tying the first loops\u2014the cast on\u2014of the shirt on one of her makeshift needles.</p><p>The swans observed her during this process. Usually three or four were stationed around her at any given time, and the rest of them paddled in the pond, nibbling on grasses and catching minnows.</p><p>It seemed to Elise that they weren\u2019t as stupid or beast-like as the day before. She was still clipped by a large white wing several times that day when a swan went dashing past, chasing bugs or a fellow swan, but none of them pecked her, and they seemed more aware of her presence.</p><p>One swan seemed intent on exploring the area. He always returned after several minutes, wiggling his tail feathers and calling to the rest of his brothers, although he often popped out of unexpected places. Once, he nearly fell into Elise\u2019s lap after crashing off the top of the rock formation where Elise had set up her knitting station.</p><p>The swan righted himself and walked away, making Elise wonder which brother it was. (Elise didn\u2019t think it was Rune, but she couldn\u2019t be sure, as none of the swans seemed to stand out as one particular brother.) When the sun started to sink on the horizon, seven swans were waiting on the pond.</p> <p>Just like the night before, waves rocked the pond surface, and an odd light grew around each swan. The swans were raised out of the water, their wings outstretched, before they disappeared in a cloud of feathers.</p><p>This time, Elise could hear the enormous splash as each brother hit the water once transformed. The feathers reformed around the princes\u2014making their glossy white clothes\u2014and Elise was once again in the presence of the seven princes of Arcainia.</p><p>Falk was the first prince out of the water, barking orders as we went. \u201cGerhart, start gathering wood suitable for a fire. Erick, we need to build at least one wall to the shelter so Elise can get out of the wind and rain. For this week, a makeshift shelter will work, but we will need to make something more permanent for the future,\u201d Falk said, passing Elise without acknowledging her at all. \u201cIf you could figure out the structure and mark out the kind of branches to look for, Mikk and Nick will fetch them for you.\u201d</p><p>Erick smiled at Elise as he followed in Falk\u2019s wake. \u201cThat sounds reasonable. We would do well to secure some sort of rope for her so we could tie the branches together to make a more solid structure,\u201d Erick said.</p><p>\u201cRune,\u201d Falk called.</p><p>\u201cShe needs a knife,\u201d Rune said, water dripping from him as he ambled to Elise\u2019s side. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Falk and Erick did a great deal of talking and walking around Elise\u2019s rock structure shelter as the rest of the brothers left the pond.</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing, Elise?\u201d Rune asked tugging on the ribbon that held Elise\u2019s hair back in a low ponytail.</p><p>\u201cBetter than could be expected, stop that,\u201d Elise said, sliding away from him.</p><p>Rune sighed. \u201cI would question you further, but I need to get started on your knife. Walk with me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure,\u201d Elise said, glancing at the rest of the Arcainian princes to see what they did. Erick had Mikk and Nick by Elise\u2019s shelter and gestured with his arms to show dimensions of the branches he was looking for.</p><p>Steffen was puttering around on the shore, sorting through rocks.</p><p>Falk ignored the oldest prince as he stalked back to the pond. \u201cGerhart, what part of now did you not understand?\u201d Falk barked.</p><p>Gerhart squeezed water from his clothes. \u201cI thought you were joking. It\u2019s dark; I can\u2019t see anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe moon is almost full, and we have a limited amount of time to work. Get going,\u201d Falk growled.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to. I\u2019m only human for an hour. I don\u2019t want to waste that hour doing chores.\u201d</p><p>Falk snatched Gerhart\u2019s shirt collar and dragged him towards the woods. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a choice. Find firewood or else,\u201d Falk barked, barely avoiding Steffen\u2014who was still puttering with rocks.</p><p>\u201cWhat is going on?\u201d Elise asked Rune as she strolled with him.</p><p>The handsome middle prince weaved up and down the shoreline, his eyes glued to the ground. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to ease your burden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t expect you to knit us shirts and make a decent camp for yourself. There are seven of us. We should be able to accomplish a decent amount of work in just an hour,\u201d Rune said, crouching to pick up a stone. He inspected it before tossing it over his shoulder and moving on.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m off to find a softwood base,\u201d Steffen announced, carrying several rocks as he ventured to the edge of the forest.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you decide to do this, and how did Falk become the captain of this venture?\u201d Elise asked as Falk exited the woods sans Gerhart.</p><p>Falk found Elise\u2019s dress and thoughtlessly ripped one of the sleeves off, making Elise wince. He tied off one end and stomped back into the woods.</p><p>\u201cHe knows the woods best. With his line of work in the Agriculture Department he\u2019s learned more about plants and trees than the rest of us combined,\u201d Rune said picking up a rock.</p><p>\u201cI would have thought you would be the one most comfortable in the wild,\u201d Elise said. \u201cYou spend a great deal of your time camping. I don\u2019t know if Falk has ever set up a camp in his entire life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he has either, but with his knowledge of trees and woods and with Erick\u2019s mind, they could accomplish more than would ever occur to me. And you\u2019re right. I\u2019ve camped the most, but I always stay in temporary camps with a tent. Steffen says we need to make a more permanent site for you. I agree,\u201d Rune said, still carrying the rock as he climbed higher up the shore.</p><p>\u201cCan you understand each other as swans?\u201d Elise asked.</p><p>\u201cGoodness no,\u201d Rune said. \u201cWe outlined all of this last night while you and Steffen were busy talking about what happened with Clotilde after the Lady Enchantress left,\u201d Rune said. He found a larger, smooth rock and briefly returned to the pond to dunk his first rock in the water.</p> <p>He sat down on the smooth shore and started chipping away at the wet stone. \u201cSit with me, please? It grieves me that I spend the whole day with you, unable to remember you or converse with you for even a moment,\u201d Rune said.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember anything as a swan?\u201d Elise asked.</p><p>\u201cOnly that you are wildly important to me. I think when I am a swan I think like a swan. Now that I am human again, it is hard to remember what it is like to be a swan,\u201d Rune admitted.</p><p>\u201cThat should make the days more bearable. It means you won\u2019t be sitting around, worrying,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps, but it\u2019s not very satisfying,\u201d Rune said as he chipped away at the stone.</p><p>Steffen returned, carrying a log that was split in half. \u201cWill this work, Rune?\u201d</p><p>Rune briefly inspected the log, feeling its grainy surface. \u201cThat\u2019s willow. It will be perfect. Remember the hardwood should be about a foot long and pointed.\u201d</p><p>Steffen tossed the log down next to Rune. \u201cI will let you sharpen it to a point,\u201d he graciously said, the white of his clothes gleaming in the night as he disappeared back into the woods.</p><p>\u201cDid you say you were making a knife?\u201d Elise asked as Rune slowly shaped the stone he hammered away at.</p><p>\u201cA rudimentary one, yes. It won\u2019t be much good as a weapon, but it should make it easier to gather the nettles; you can saw them off at the base with this,\u201d Rune said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCan I do anything to help?\u201d Elise asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Falk stressed as he emerged from the shadows, holding Elise\u2019s ripped sleeve like a sack. \u201cSave these for tomorrow,\u201d he instructed, opening it to show Elise the brightly colored berries kept inside. \u201cThey\u2019re safe to eat, although they\u2019re going to be tart,\u201d he said before he moved on, putting the sleeve of berries on Elise\u2019s dress before he disappeared back into the woods.</p><p>\u201cWhat Falk means to say is that we feel you should sit and relax. You labor for us all day. It is only fair that we should help you however we can,\u201d Rune said, holding up the rock he was shaping to get a better look at it in the moonlight. \u201cI might have to delay the knife and work first on getting you a fire. It will be easier to see by firelight.\u201d</p><p>Gerhart returned and dumped an armload of dry branches near Elise\u2019s shelter. Mikk and Nick were behind him, dragging branches as thick as Elise\u2019s fist, which Erick leaned against the jutting rock roof to create a basic wall.</p> <p>\u201cTinder,\u201d Mikk said to Gerhart, pointing to the meadow where Falk\u2019s horse had spent the afternoon.</p><p>Gerhart rolled his eyes, but waded into meadow, looking for dry grass.</p><p>\u201cHow many more logs and branches do you want?\u201d Nick asked, dusting his hands off.</p><p>\u201cAbout double of what you just retrieved. I would dearly love to construct something more dependable, but without rope or any sort of binding agent, this is the best we can do,\u201d Erick said.</p><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll grab Falk\u2019s horse. I can use the girth from his saddle to bundle more wood and balance it on his back\u2014if the fool horse doesn\u2019t run off on me,\u201d Nick said.</p> <p>\u201cHis bit and reins are next to the saddle,\u201d Elise called.</p><p>\u201cRighto,\u201d Nick said, grabbing the tack. He whistled as he approached Falk\u2019s horse. \u201cHey there, horsie. Don\u2019t be a brute like your owner, and let me catch you.\u201d</p><p>Mikk stayed behind and started ripping dry, flaky bark off some of the firewood Gerhart had collected.</p><p>Elise watched her foster brothers and tried to swallow the knot forming in her throat. \u201cThis means a lot to me,\u201d she said.</p><p>Rune dropped his chipped rock to ease closer to Elise. He slid an arm around her back and placed his cheek against her head. \u201cI wish I could spare you this ordeal. What we\u2019re doing doesn\u2019t seem like it is nearly enough,\u201d he said before a rock whacked him in the back. Rune abruptly pulled away from Elise, wincing in pain. \u201cOuch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Falk said, sounding anything but as he dumped a few handfuls of clover onto Elise\u2019s dress with the berries. \u201cThese are edible. They don\u2019t taste like much, but they will fill you when you grow hungry, Lamb,\u201d he said before turning on his heels and joining Erick at Elise\u2019s shelter.</p> <p>\u201cHe sounded angry,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because he is,\u201d Rune said, rubbing the sore spot on his back before he went back to chipping away at his rock.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Elise said, watching Falk inspect Erick\u2019s growing wall.</p><p>Some things, even in the worst situations, didn\u2019t ever seem to change.</p><p>Elise knitted as she watched the sun sink behind the trees. Soon it would be sunset, and her foster brothers would be men again for an hour.</p><p>Staring at the sky distracted Elise from the way her fingers burned and stung. Each loop she made with the stinging nettle stem was painful and torturous, but Elise knitted with a stony expression. When she wasn\u2019t eagerly watching for the sun to set, she spent the time making calculations. She mentally remapped Brandis\u2019 operations budget. She calculated the various prices at which the royal house could hope to price their crops. Numbers ran through her mind from the moment she picked up the blistering, burning shirt until she finally set it down again.</p><p>When Elise was busy running sums and mathematical problems through her mind, she didn\u2019t have the capacity to acknowledge the stinging pain in her fingers.</p><p>Because Elise was so deep in thought\u2014she was calculating how long it would be until Carabas\u2019 harbor would be open\u2014Elise didn\u2019t hear the footsteps until they were just behind her.</p> <p>Elise whirled around, clutching the shirt to her belly. Her eyes swiveled back and forth as she looked for the source of footsteps. She didn\u2019t see the figure until it stepped out from behind a tree.</p><p>\u201cPrincess?\u201d</p><p>Elise went slack with relief. It was Brida, the stone-faced captain.</p><p>Brida approached Elise cautiously. She wore plain breeches and a black shirt, and her hair was pulled back in a pretty braid. But even out of uniform, one could not mistake Brida for anything but a warrior. For starters, there was a sword buckled to her side, and Elise would bet her last copper that there were daggers tucked up her sleeves and in her boots. She walked with a grace that was different from females who minced along in pretty dresses. She was thicker and taller than most females, but she was lean, and her eyes were always watchful. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Elise offered Brida a wan smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing out here? Are you knitting?\u201d Brida asked, her eyes going to the horrible shirt Elise still clung to. \u201cWhere are your brothers?\u201d</p><p>Elise nodded her head to the pond where the swans paddled around\u2014either uninterested in Brida\u2019s entrance, or filled with too many swan thoughts to rally any curiosity.</p><p>\u201cWhere are your brothers?\u201d Brida repeated, speaking loudly and over enunciating.</p> <p>Out of everyone to find Elise, why did it have to be Brida? Deciding the guard captain would eventually figure out that the swans were her brothers, or they would transform in front of the guard and then she could figure it out, Elise sat back down and went back to knitting.</p><p>However, Brida was not someone you could easily put off. The bossy female crouched down in front of Elise and put her hand on top of the shirt. \u201cWhat are you\u2014,\u201d she yelped and drew her hand back when the plants pricked her palm. \u201cHave you gone mad?\u201d Brida asked, never one to sweeten her words.</p><p>Elise carefully moved the shirt away from Brida.</p><p>\u201cI have a message for you from Princess Gabrielle,\u201d Brida said, reaching inside her shirt to withdraw a sealed envelope.</p><p>Elise reached for it, but Brida held it out of range. \u201cI\u2019m not giving it to you until you tell me what is going on.\u201d</p> <p>Elise patiently held out her hand.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Brida said, shaking her head. \u201cGet a hold of yourself, Princess, and tell me what\u2019s going on. If you can control yourself and put aside your foolish emotions, I will give you the letter.\u201d</p><p>Brida\u2019s arrogance and the way she talked sent a spark of irritation through Elise, but she kept her expression bland as she started at the letter.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Brida shook her head. \u201cNot until you stop acting petty.\u201d</p><p>She thought Elise was being petty, did she? Elise glanced down at her hand to assure herself that some of the sharp hairs and thorns from the stinging nettle plant were stuck in her skin. (There were some, drawing tiny pinpricks of blood.) Elise smacked her open hand on top of Brida\u2019s, the stuck nettles scratching the soft, delicate skin on the top of captain\u2019s hand.</p><p>Brida yelped and fell on her rear. Elise used the moment of distraction to snatch the letter from Brida. She tore open the envelope and removed the letter, reading it before Brida recovered.</p> <p>My dearest sister,</p><p>I assume Angelique has already visited you and informed you of our failure. Angelique told me there was little hope that my husband and your brothers would ever return to normal. But there is a small possibility, should you be willing to take it.</p><p>I must confess I do not know you as well as I should, but I am confident of the love you have for your brothers. If there is a way to save them, I am positive you will pursue it.</p><p>Keeping that in mind, I have sent Brida for your disposal. I am aware you two have some differences, (Elise internally snorted.) But Brida is unfailingly loyal to our family, and I dare not send anyone else. She will guard you and see to your needs\u2014although I would never venture to call her a maid, if I were you. You would probably get a black eye for your mistake, F\u00fcrstin or not.</p><p>I wish you luck with your task and our beloved family. I am sorry I failed you, but I shall do my best in your absence.</p><p>With all the luck in the world, Gabrielle</p><p>Elise was grateful Gabrielle had thought to send a guard. Elise would be safer with Brida around. Brida was a skilled warrior, had a healthy set of lungs, and she had brought weapons.</p><p>But still... did it have to be Brida?</p> <p>Brida was rubbing the top of her hand and looking reproachfully at Elise. \u201cPrincess,\u201d she said, grinding her teeth. \u201cI do not know what is wrong with you, but could you please direct me to your brothers?\u201d</p><p>Elise stared at Brida. Hadn\u2019t Gabrielle told her of her brother\u2019s plight? (Or flight, really, if one wanted to be technical.) Elise stood, carrying the letter and her ugly shirt, and walked to the edge of the pond.</p><p>The sun was almost set. Elise couldn\u2019t be sure since the trees blocked the last of its descent, but judging on the light, her brothers would be available for a chat with Brida in a few minutes.</p><p>\u201cPrincess,\u201d Brida said, sounding a little like Falk in her frustration. She walked up to Elise and put her hands on her shoulders, forcing Elise to turn around. \u201cWhat, in the name of all that is holy, are you\u2014,\u201d Brida broke off her lecture and jumped backwards when a swan furiously paddled across the pond and clambered onto shore, hissing and lunging at Brida.</p><p>Brida took a few steps before she stopped and held her ground. To her credit, she did not grapple for a weapon. Instead she narrowed her eyes and studied the upset bird.</p><p>Several other swans ringed around Elise, forming a white, waist high wall of protection. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d Brida said after her eyes swept across the pond, and she did the math.</p><p>The swans scampered back into the pond, floating on its tumultuous surface. They started to glow and extended their wings before they disappeared in a storm cloud of white feathers.</p><p>When the light faded and seven princes were left behind, sloshing in the water, Brida went down on one knee. \u201cMy Lords,\u201d she said.</p><p>Falk, just as blunt as Brida, plunged past greetings. \u201cWhat did you hope to accomplish by bullying Elise, Captain Meier?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cW-what?\u201d Brida said, lifting her head up.</p><p>\u201cBullying might be a bit of a strong word to use, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Nick asked, shaking his leg to get rid of dripping water.</p><p>\u201cI am disappointed in you, Captain Meier,\u201d Rune said in a gentle voice as he moved next to Elise, placing a warm hand on her lower back. \u201cI thought you were more patient, and that you would realize Elise is not one to act oddly without a good reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Prince Rune,\u201d Brida said, staring at the ground.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t do it again now, will you? What Elise does, she does for our sake,\u201d Steffen said with his portrait smile. \u201cPlease stand, Captain Meier. In spite of our words, we are thankful you have come. What news do you have for us?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI had a letter to deliver to Princess Elise,\u201d Brida said.</p><p>When Steffen whipped around to face Elise, Elise held out the letter. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t say much,\u201d she said. \u201cGabrielle probably wrote so little in case it was intercepted.\u201d</p><p>Brida twitched at the sound of Elise\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cPatience, Captain. We will explain the situation once we hear yours first,\u201d Falk said, standing between the captain and Elise.</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t much to tell, Prince Falk. The guards and I knew something was wrong when all eight of the royal children disappeared. There were whispers, rumors that Clotilde did something to you. An enchantress launched an attack against Queen Clotilde. Your subjects did their best to help, but Queen Clotilde was able to throw the lady enchantress off her. I know the enchantress and Princess Gabrielle spoke together for some time, for I guarded their meeting. The enchantress left, and Crown Princess Gabrielle summoned a number of captains and military men she trusted. I was among them. She explained to us that you had been cursed, although she did not say how. She asked me to track the enchantress to the location where I would find Princess Elise and all of the royal Princes. The rest of the men, I believe, she organized to create a resistance force.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do they resist?\u201d Mikk asked.</p> <p>\u201cI only heard very few of the plans, for Princess Gabrielle thought it would be best to leave immediately\u2014in the end it did not matter for I could not track the enchantress at all and had to rely on luck,\u201d Brida said, standing at attention.</p><p>\u201cHumph. Elise, come with me,\u201d Falk said, pulling Elise along by her elbow.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014,\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buts. The others will explain the nature of the curse to her,\u201d Falk said, dragging Elise into the dim forest. Falk kicked at plants, his expression cold as he looked through the underbrush in the nearly extinguished sunlight.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d Elise asked.</p><p>Falk ignored the question and hunkered over, digging plants out of the ground.</p><p>\u201cFalk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRub this on your hands. The undersides\u2014the spores will ease the itching,\u201d Falk said, slapping several large, leafy ferns into Elise\u2019s hands.</p> <p>Surprised, Elise meekly did as she was told, hissing when the first touch of the fern burned almost as badly as the stinging nettles themselves. The longer Elise rubbed, though, the better her fingers felt. The angry red splotches eased some, although several open wounds still oozed blood, and the burning gave way to a dull ache.</p><p>Some of the tension left Elise with the pain, and she closed her eyes. \u201cThank you, Falk.\u201d</p><p>Falk rustled around in the underbrush, ripping at more ferns, and didn\u2019t reply.</p><p>Elise used the other fern leaf on her other hand, allowing a slight smile to ease across her lips.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t made for this kind of work,\u201d Falk said.</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>Falk straightened up, holding a pile of fern leaves in his arms. \u201cThis terrible task\u2014it is too much to ask of you. It worries me.\u201d</p><p>Just like that Elise\u2019s smile was gone. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be afraid. I will break the curse. You might not think me competent, but I\u2019m stubborn enough to see us through this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not what I meant,\u201d Falk said.</p><p>\u201cThen what did you mean to say?\u201d</p><p>Falk\u2019s shoulders moved in an almost imperceptible shrug. He led the way back to Elise\u2019s camp, placing the ferns in Elise\u2019s shelter by the rock.</p><p>\u201cFalk, Elise, come see what Brida thought to bring\u2014the smart girl,\u201d Nick called.</p><p>Steffen stood on the water\u2019s edge, Gabrielle\u2019s letter dangling from his hands. Mikk, Nick, Erick, and Gerhart were huddled around Brida\u2019s saddlebags and horse. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFlint\u2014beautiful! Here, Mikk, catch. You are brilliant, Brida,\u201d Nick said, tossing two rocks to his twin.</p><p>Mikk caught the rocks and walked over to the prepared tinder pile\u2014for in the end, Steffen had been unable to accomplish his assigned task the previous night before the hour was over.</p><p>\u201cI brought only what any competent soldier would bring,\u201d Brida said, inspecting Elise\u2019s few belongings with obvious disapproval.</p><p>\u201cElise, how much did you knit today? I would like to calculate the length of time it will take you to finish our clothing,\u201d Erick asked.</p> <p>\u201cDid you really bring nothing but the horse and his tack when you left Castle Brandis?\u201d Brida asked.</p><p>\u201cElise didn\u2019t have much time, and she doesn\u2019t have the training to keep a cool head as you do,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>\u201cNick,\u201d Mikk said as he scraped the flint stones together to make a spark.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Nick blinked.</p><p>Mikk didn\u2019t respond and tried to fan the sparks into tiny flames on the dry bark and grass tinder.</p> <p>\u201cThe shirts, Elise. How much did you complete?\u201d Erick reminded Elise.</p><p>\u201cNot very much, I bet,\u201d Gerhart snorted.</p><p>Elise grew tense at the words being cast around her. Her heart tightened until Rune, her rock, placed an arm around Elise\u2019s shoulders. \u201cEnough. Elise is just as cursed as we are, perhaps more so. She deserves an hour\u2019s reprieve,\u201d he said to his brothers before whispering into Elise\u2019s ears. \u201cWalk with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cHow are your hands? Do they hurt terribly?\u201d Rune asked as they left the camp, strolling along the shore. His hazel eyes were colored with concern as he brushed a hand against Elise\u2019s cheek.</p><p>\u201cIt has been better since Falk told me to rub them with a fern plant he found,\u201d Elise said.</p> <p>\u201cCan I do anything for you? Is there anything I could do that would bring you even a little comfort?\u201d Rune asked, his hand resting against her neck.</p><p>Elise smiled. \u201cJust being with you is enough, Rune.\u201d</p><p>Rune abruptly stopped walking. He grabbed Elise and dragged her to him, tucking her head in the curve of his shoulder. He wrapped his arms around her and squeezed tightly.</p><p>Elise blinked several times in shock. \u201cRune?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said.</p><p>Elise shifted uncomfortably before she hooked her elbow across Rune\u2019s other shoulder.</p><p>In Rune\u2019s arms, Elise felt safe and warm. She could forget the ache in her hands, and the fact that he would be swan again in a short time. Elise could depend on Rune. He was sincere.</p><p>\u201cThis is difficult for you as well,\u201d Elise guessed when Rune finally released her.</p> <p>\u201cIt is frustrating. I try to remember who I am, who you are, when I am a swan, but I can\u2019t,\u201d Rune said, hooking Elise\u2019s arm through his before they started strolling again.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you will get better at it,\u201d Elise said. \u201cBesides, I don\u2019t think any of your brothers remember any more than you do. All of you run around and chase bugs and eat most of the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFalk remembers. I don\u2019t know how much, but he better retains his humanity than the rest of us,\u201d Rune said.</p><p>\u201cNone of this is your fault, Rune. You\u2019re doing the best you can. There\u2019s no need to compare yourself to another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRune, Mikk wants you,\u201d Falk said.</p><p>Elise would have leaped backwards if Rune wasn\u2019t holding her arm. \u201cWhy?\u201d Rune said. His voice was cold.</p><p>\u201cBrida brought fishing line with her. He wants to catch fish to get Elise a decent dinner.\u201d</p><p>Rune exhaled in obvious aggravation\u2014a rare display for the usually sunny tempered hero. \u201cFine,\u201d he said, dropping Elise\u2019s arm. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Elise. You should return and see what else Brida brought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Elise said, obediently following her middle foster brother.</p><p>They were only a short distance from the camp, but when she rejoined her brothers, Elise felt like she had been wrenched back into reality.</p><p>Erick was crouched over Elise\u2019s knitting project, measuring it with a stick. Brida was tending to her mount, tying it to a tree with Falk\u2019s horse.</p><p>\u201cIf we chop down a few saplings, it should be easy enough to make a pen to put the horses in at night. We can\u2019t risk them running off,\u201d Nick said, admiring the hand axe Brida had brought.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to take you more than one night to do that,\u201d Gerhart said.</p><p>\u201cYes, but it will be time well spent. Care to help me, Gerhie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Gerhie, so young, so selfish,\u201d Nick sighed.</p><p>\u201cElise, Mikk got a fire going so we can use torches now. Would you like company to gather some more stinging nettles?\u201d Steffen asked.</p><p>\u201cI have enough for tomorrow,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>Steffen handed her the rock knife Rune had fashioned for her. \u201cYes, but you\u2019ll need more after that. I know I cannot help you pick, but I could keep you company,\u201d Steffen said, glancing at the shirt Erick was studying from a different angle.</p><p>Elise swallowed the knot in her throat. Obviously her brothers didn\u2019t think she was working fast enough. \u201cAlright,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s our Perfect Princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d Elise grimly said. \u201cAlways.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter 6</p><p>Three days after Brida\u2019s arrival, Elise sat on the sandy pond bank, watching her foster brothers in their swan bodies. It was only a hunch, but Elise thought she could occasionally discern which swan was which prince.</p><p>Gerhart, or the swan Elise thought was Gerhart, spent an exorbitant amount of time swimming back and forth in front of the females from the flock of ducks. He tucked his head and looked inviting and elegant as he swam across the pond surface.</p><p>Nick, and as a result Mikk, was easy to pick out. Nick spent his afternoons swimming after the pair of geese, badly imitating their honks and doing his best to be a general pest. Mikk usually swam several feet behind him, plucking out one of Nick\u2019s feathers when he felt his twin grew too annoying.</p> <p>Elise watched Nick perform a poor goose honk imitation as she stiffly tied another stem of stinging nettle into her knitting project. She was grateful for Nick\u2019s antics. They made the knitting just a little more bearable.</p><p>Every stitch, every move was agony for Elise. It felt like her hands were on fire. Each plant embedded so many tiny hairs in her fingers, Elise gave up trying to remove them at night.</p><p>Elise looked up when Brida sat near her with a thump. The captain brushed sweat from her forehead and dropped her axe on the ground.</p><p>Elise turned around like an owl to look at Brida\u2019s project\u2014the horse pen Nick had started on. It was finished, the corner posts pounded in and makeshift logs crisscrossed to form walls.</p><p>Brida mopped her face with a handkerchief. \u201cI forgot. I was supposed to give this to you,\u201d Brida said, passing a rolled up letter to Elise.</p> <p>Elise set her knitting aside and eagerly took the letter. She glanced at Brida as she unrolled it.</p><p>\u201cI apologize, Princess. As I said, I forgot,\u201d Brida repeated, her words lacking in conviction.</p><p>Elise shook her head before she glanced at the bottom of her letter. A smile leaped to her lips. It was from Mertein!</p><p>F\u00fcrstin Elise, Prinzessin Gabrielle said I may write you a letter as it is likely I will not see you for some time. I am not certain this letter will find you, but I hope it does.</p><p>I am engaged to marry another.</p><p>Elise stared at the words. She had to read them three times before their meaning sunk in and she was able to read on.</p> <p>My family heavily invested in ships and cargo to use when the Carabas harbor opens. The more delayed the harbor opening is, the worse it looks for my family.</p><p>Since you have left, the harbor has been delayed indefinitely as the country hasn\u2019t the funds to continue. I had no choice. To save my family, I have become engaged to an heiress.</p><p>I cannot sacrifice my family to wait for you, Elise, and even before family\u2019s monetary problems fell on me, I knew I would not be able to marry you, in spite of your affection for me.</p><p>I am a coward for writing this to you now, when you have lost everything, but I do not want to mislead you. I should have told you in person when I had the chance.</p><p>Please forgive me, F\u00fcrstin. I think in time you will understand why I...</p><p>Elise could read no farther. She didn\u2019t want to read empty excuses. They would bring her no comfort.</p><p>The letter dropped from Elise\u2019s hands as she stared at the pond where the swan princes swam.</p><p>\u201cPrincess?\u201d Brida said, rocking to her knees when the first of Elise\u2019s tears fell.</p> <p>Elise clasped a hand to her mouth, biting her knuckle to keep her sobs and screams bottled in. Even now she had to sacrifice for her brothers. She couldn\u2019t let one noise escape for their sake, even when all Elise wanted to do was cry until she was empty.</p><p>\u201cPrincess Elise, what is wrong?\u201d Brida asked, crouching next to Elise.</p><p>Elise genuinely liked Mertein.</p><p>She had chosen him because of his family and their standing, yes, but she had chosen him because of his easy smile and sweet temperament. Mertein never expected more from her. He didn\u2019t require perfection. He was affectionate, easy to talk to, and sweet. She was never absolutely certain they would marry, but she thought that would be because her father would be forced to send her to another country, not because Mertein would marry another!</p><p>\u201cPrincess,\u201d Brida said, her voice taking on a note of panic as she placed her hands on Elise\u2019s shoulders and shook her.</p><p>Elise\u2019s heart ached\u2014throbbing worse than her burning fingers.</p><p>Mertein was the one personal choice she made. Just like everything else in her life, she knew he had to be suitable, yes, but there were at least a dozen other men who were just as suitable. It was Mertein Elise had hoped for.</p><p>And now he had abandoned her.</p><p>Elise picked up the letter and tore it right beneath the words \u201cI am engaged to marry another.\u201d</p><p>She gave the top half of the letter to Brida and stood, crumpling the rest of the letter in her fist. She grabbed the shirt she was working on before she retreated to the woods, tears still falling from her eyes.</p><p>Even in great sorrow Elise had to be perfect. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The following day, Elise sat with her brothers around the fire, knitting in the orange light. Telling them about Mertein when they turned human the night before had been pure torture\u2014Gerhart and Mikk didn\u2019t seem to care, Falk and Erick acted as if they expected it all along. Nick made a badly received joke about it. Only Rune and Steffen were sympathetic.</p><p>Thankfully, though, they seemed to pick up on Elise\u2019s sorrow and did their best to spare Elise\u2019s feelings. Or so she thought.</p><p>\u201cBased on the rate at which Elise is knitting, we can expect to be human again by midsummer,\u201d Erick pronounced.</p><p>\u201cDo you think you\u2019ll be able to speed up as you get better at this, Elise?\u201d Nick asked.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say,\u201d Elise said. \u201cIt did take most of my first day to remember how to knit and cast on and purl. After I complete this first shirt\u2014and I use that description loosely, it\u2019s more like a shrug of some sort\u2014it should be easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImagine that. Elise isn\u2019t perfect at something,\u201d Gerhart sneered.</p><p>\u201cGerhart,\u201d Rune warned as he emerged from the woods with an armload of firewood.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not certain I will be able to knit faster, though,\u201d Elise continued, clenching her teeth to keep herself from snarling at Gerhart.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Nick asked.</p> <p>\u201cBecause it hurts a great deal to do this, and my fingers are growing stiff and inflexible,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Brida is willing, she should scout out the area during daylight. There may be a village nearby where we could purchase a salve or dressing for Elise\u2019s hands,\u201d Falk said.</p><p>\u201cExcellent idea. Would you mind terribly, Captain Meier?\u201d Rune asked, flashing her a dazzling smile.</p><p>\u201cNot at all Prince Rune,\u201d Brida easily agreed.</p><p>\u201cWe appreciate your willingness, Brida,\u201d Nick said.</p> <p>Mikk nodded in agreement.</p><p>\u201cElise is just being a girl,\u201d Gerhart said, rolling his eyes. \u201cFalk already found her those plants to help with the pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate you,\u201d Elise said, the words were out of her mouth before she thought them through, but even after she spoke Elise wasn\u2019t sorry. She was sick of subjecting herself to Gerhart\u2019s bad temper.</p><p>\u201cSo the Perfect Princess hates someone. Maybe she\u2019s not so perfect after all,\u201d Gerhart said.</p><p>\u201cI have done nothing wrong to you. I have spent months, if not years, putting up with your temper tantrums, and I refuse to deal with them anymore as I spend my days making sacrifices for you,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cYou have done nothing to me?\u201d Gerhart sputtered. \u201cDo you have any idea what I\u2019ve gone through because of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGerhart,\u201d Falk warned.</p><p>\u201cAll day long all I hear is how wonderful you are, how great you are, how you\u2019re going to be the family savior. Why can\u2019t you be more like your sister, Gerhart? She\u2019s so young, and she\u2019s already in charge of a department, Gerhart!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour jealousy is not my problem,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cFunny, I said the same thing to my dear brothers, and they didn\u2019t seem to think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t making any sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen maybe you should try talking to Falk and your precious Rune. You didn\u2019t know they\u2019ve been going behind your back, intimidating anyone who looks twice at you, huh? I\u2019m surprised your dearest Mertein held out as long as he did.\u201d</p><p>Elise turned to look at Falk and Rune, who were standing next to each other. Her voice was quiet but as sharp as a sword when she asked, \u201cWhat is he talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never noticed?\u201d Gerhart continued, unable to shut up. \u201cFalk is over the moon for you, and Rune has spent years keeping him away from you. You think you know your golden-boy-hero? You should see him when he\u2019s threatening someone to make them stay away from you. He\u2019s real heroic then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGERHART,\u201d Rune snapped.</p><p>Elise stared unseeingly at her foster brothers. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>There was an uncomfortable silence for several moments before Mikk spoke. \u201cSo, it will take Elise to midsummer to free us,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d Elise said, scrambling to her feet. \u201cYou owe me an explanation. What is Hart talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, Elise,\u201d Rune said, his voice once again warm and light. \u201cIgnore him. Gerhart has always been jealous of you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo, he hasn\u2019t,\u201d Elise said. When Queen Ingrid had first plucked her from palace service\u2014where she had discovered Elise\u2014Gerhart was the friendliest out of all the brothers. He was Elise\u2019s companion as a child. It was only about three years ago that he started getting prickly. At first Elise thought it was because he was growing up, but when it continued, she realized there was no reasonable explanation.</p><p>\u201cFocusing on the task at hand would be wisest,\u201d Erick said. \u201cWe must break our curse and free Father from Clotilde. It is our duty.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was Erick\u2019s mistake to speak of duty.</p><p>\u201cOur duty? Since when was this our duty?\u201d Elise asked. \u201cAngelique made it clear this is my duty. It has always been this way, hasn\u2019t it? I have been valued by this family because of what I do. I do the things no one else wants to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who acts the part of Perfect Princess,\u201d Gerhart muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou think I WANT to be perfect? I hate the flute. I wish I could break my instrument in half! Horses terrify me, but I force myself to go riding for the sake of this festering family. I would rather eat glass than converse with the smug Sole Ambassador, but none of it is good enough for you! No matter what I do, you want more. You don\u2019t even like me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d Nick started to say.</p><p>\u201cOh, is it? Is that why you have so much fun picking at what I do?\u201d Elise asked, folding her arms across her chest.</p><p>\u201cI never\u2014,\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always do. Not like any of the others are any better. Steffen only likes me because I\u2019m the one sibling he can get to do whatever he wants. All he has to do us utter the words duty, and I will do it. Mikk has never bothered to hide his distaste of me; Erick is just as bad as Steffen as he constantly reminds me that I need to perform better, that I have to do more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not\u2014,\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you dare to say that when you just got over asking me if I could knit faster! At least Hart is openly bratty and doesn\u2019t even pretend to like me. And you two,\u201d Elise said, twisting to face Rune and Falk. \u201cI don\u2019t believe a word of what Hart said about you. It\u2019s impossible. Everyone knows Falk hates me.\u201d</p><p>Rune and Falk were silent, and Elise lost some of her certainty.</p><p>\u201cRune, you didn\u2019t bully Mertein,\u201d Elise said, changing tactics.</p><p>Rune opened his mouth but said nothing.</p><p>\u201cHe did it only because he is in love with you, Elise,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>Elise shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy do you think he won\u2019t let you call him brother?\u201d Gerhart said.</p><p>\u201cElise,\u201d Rune said, reaching for her.</p><p>Elise leaped backwards. \u201cWho are you really?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cElise, you\u2019re over-wrought,\u201d Steffen said.</p><p>\u201cOf course I am!\u201d Elise snarled. \u201cThe one brother I counted on is-is..! I lost the man I wanted to marry because of YOU. Mertein was my personal choice, and he\u2019s gone because I\u2019m out here sacrificing for you, and you all expect me to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t expect\u2014,\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you treating me like this? The second you turn human you want to know my progress. You push me to knit in the firelight, to collect more stinging nettles. You won\u2019t let me do anything but sleep, eat, and knit! This stupid shirt is red because I\u2019m bleeding on it! And you all act like Brida is saving the world because she\u2019s doing things so I can knit more! I HATE you! Forget breaking the curse by midsummer\u2014I\u2019m not going to knit as much as another loop. You all can stay swans for the rest of your lives. I DON\u2019T CARE!\u201d Elise said.</p><p>She left the firelight and stomped into the woods.</p> <p>\u201cElise,\u201d Rune called.</p><p>Elise heard one of her foster brothers move, as if to follow her, and she bolted. She raced blindly through the dark trees, crashing through bushes and almost wiping out on a fallen log.</p><p>When the glow of the campfire couldn\u2019t be seen anymore, Elise found a giant tree and started climbing. She lost her grip a few times, and the bark scratched her already injured hands, but when Elise was high enough, she found a cradle in the center of the tree formed by three large branches stretching out in different directions.</p><p>Elise huddled there, tears streaming from her eyes.</p><p>\u201cElise!\u201d an Arcainian prince called.</p><p>\u201cEliiiiise!\u201d</p><p>\u201cElise!\u201d</p><p>Elise closed her eyes and covered her ears, blocking out the shouts. She was exhausted; she felt horribly alone, and she didn\u2019t know what to do.</p><p>\u201cElise!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEeeeliiiise!\u201d</p><p>Elise woke to the scraping noise of a knife on wood. She slowly opened her eyes, grimacing and rolling her shoulders, which had grown stiff in her unusual sleeping position in the tree. After anchoring herself to a branch, Elise leaned over the side to look for the source of the noise.</p><p>Brida was sitting at the base of Elise\u2019s tree, whittling away at a chunk of wood. \u201cI waited until sunrise to track you through the forest,\u201d Brida said.</p><p>Elise leaned back into her spot on the tree. How does she know I\u2019m awake?</p><p>\u201cYour brothers looked for you until they had to return to the pond. They\u2019re worried.\u201d</p><p>Elise rolled her eyes. They were probably more worried that Elise wasn\u2019t going to knit their shirts.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t intend to talk to them tonight, I would like to tell them you are safe.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Elise closed her eyes and leaned back into the embrace of the tree. Her stomach growled like a starving bear. Elise tried to muffle the noises by wrapping her arms around her waist.</p><p>She nearly jumped out of the tree when rope hit the branch next to her. It slid off the surface and fell back to the ground. Another swing and the rope sailed over the branch. The end was weighted down with a stone, so it made a rudimentary pulley of a sort. After some scuffling on the ground, Brida used the rope to heft up a small parcel of food containing berries, some edible plants, and a little bit of cheese.</p><p>\u201cEat, Princess,\u201d Brida advised, sitting down on the ground again, placing her back to the tree as she kept whittling.</p><p>Elise took the food, setting it on her knees. Her stomach growled again, so Elise reluctantly started with the berries. She occasionally leaned out of her tree to glance at Brida far below. The captain kept whittling, not looking at all inclined to move.</p> <p>Night fell. Elise remained in her tree.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going back to the campsite. It\u2019s not safe to leave you out here, but...,\u201d Brida trailed off and scuffed a boot in the ground. \u201cHere, take this,\u201d she said, using her pulley system to send a canvas bag up to Elise.</p><p>In the bag was a wooden whistle.</p><p>\u201cBlow it if you are in trouble\u2014whether now or when you can\u2019t speak. And gather up the rope if you don\u2019t want to be sniffed out by your brothers,\u201d Brida said before trudging off through the woods. \u201cI will be back once I get more supplies and tell your brothers you are safe,\u201d she called before she disappeared into the undergrowth.</p><p>Elise stretched out in her tree and stared up at the green canopy of leaves above her. She didn\u2019t think much time had passed, so she almost fell out of her tree when torchlight lit up the forest.</p> <p>\u201cBrida came from this direction, so Elise must be somewhere in this part of the forest.\u201d</p><p>It was Rune.</p><p>\u201cThat may be, but you do realize when she sees us there\u2019s a good chance she might attempt to impale you with something?\u201d</p><p>And Steffen.</p><p>\u201cElise would never hurt us,\u201d Rune said, brandishing the torch high above his head.</p><p>\u201cOh no, she would not hurt me. I didn\u2019t mislead her and lie to her about my feelings and the feelings of my greatest rival for the past three or four years or bully her sweetheart. No, if she is going to hurt someone it\u2019s going to be you. I\u2019m along so I can properly apologize and drag you back to the pond after you pass out from blood loss.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow thoughtful of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can be a decent older brother.\u201d</p><p>Elise peered out of her tree, watching her foster brothers weave through the trees.</p><p>\u201cThis just proves that honesty is the best policy,\u201d Steffen said.</p><p>\u201cAre you referring to Falk and me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo a certain extent, yes. Did you already know Elise is afraid of horses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. She told me when I found her weeping in the stables several years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the flute?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did not know she hated it, but I knew she didn\u2019t like it. She told me as much when she first started learning it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy. Why did she tell you?\u201d</p><p>The pair was just a stone\u2019s throw from Elise\u2019s tree.</p><p>\u201cBecause I asked,\u201d Rune said.</p><p>Steffen sighed. \u201cNo wonder she\u2019s furious with you. She told you all the things she told no one else, and you never thought to open your great big yap to let her know you were in love with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything because you and Father forbid it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was before Clotilde waltzed into the picture.</p><p>\u201cWould you care to discuss your feelings for Gabrielle at this moment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d Steffen said, stopping two trees away from Elise\u2019s lookout.</p><p>\u201cExactly. What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. I changed my mind, I\u2019m going back to the camp. Elise could be anywhere in this forest. We\u2019re better off trying to persuade Brida to tell us where she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not going to budge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if she doesn\u2019t, my time will be spent just as well as yours,\u201d Steffen said.</p><p>\u201cCan you find your way back in the dark? I need the torch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll manage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well, I\u2019ll see you before we transform back into swans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose. Walk carefully,\u201d Steffen said as Rune started to walk away.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Rune called over his shoulder.</p><p>After the light from his torch faded, Steffen stayed still in the utter darkness. \u201cElise?\u201d</p><p>Elise jumped in her tree cradle. How does he know I\u2019m here?</p><p>\u201cElise, I don\u2019t think I can apologize for our conduct. There were things we didn\u2019t know, things I didn\u2019t know, but that doesn\u2019t excuse us. You are right. We lean too heavily upon you, and we take it for granted that you will save the day\u2014whether it be by charming Father when he\u2019s angry at the rest of us, or safely escorting us around when we\u2019re nothing but swans.\u201d</p><p>Elise stubbornly remained silent. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut you underestimate our feelings for you. You have no idea how difficult it is to see your baby sister... We can\u2019t fix this,\u201d Steffen said.</p><p>Elise looked up at these words, not because of what they meant but because of the way Steffen said them. Steffen typically wore an immobile fa?ade of good humor. Rarely would one see him angry, and the only time Elise could ever recall seeing sorrow on his face was when Queen Ingrid died. But now Elise could hear Steffen\u2019s voice wobble with emotion.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that we can\u2019t free ourselves as swans. It is that we can\u2019t do anything to protect you. We\u2019re stupid birds by day, understanding very little and remembering even less. Even if we knew, what could we do for you? It is terrible, Elise, to watch you undertake such pain and suffering for us when we can do nothing in return. I was determined to never sacrifice any of my siblings, and that is precisely what we\u2019ve done to you.\u201d</p><p>Steffen was silent for a few moments before he continued. \u201cThere is nothing worse as a prince, or as a man, than to see someone you care deeply for suffering and to be unable to fix it. As a result, I fear we may appear to be callous to you because we\u2019re festering in our selfishness, wondering if all of this is worth it if we can\u2019t even protect our sister.\u201d</p> <p>A twig cracked when Steffen shifted. \u201cNone of this excuses our behavior, but we owed you an explanation. I am sorry, Elise. I never thought you would put up a front as I do.\u201d</p><p>The silence stretched on again as Steffen gathered his thoughts. \u201cAngelique, the Lady Enchantress, will be able to free us in a year. We will gladly wait until then. You are free to do whatever you want, Elise. You have already saved us by bringing us to Verglas. We can ask nothing further of you. Think on what you would like to do, sister. We will do everything in our power to see you happy. Sweet dreams, Elise,\u201d Steffen said.</p><p>He crunched on leaves and twigs as he marched back in the direction of their camp.</p><p>Elise sat in her tree and listened to her older brother walk away.</p><p>\u201cFreedom isn\u2019t want I wanted. I just want to be included,\u201d Elise murmured.</p> <p>Chapter 7</p><p>The following day, Elise was too stiff to stay in her tree for the day. Instead, she retrieved her knitting\u2014if she was being honest with herself she knew she could never leave her foster brothers as swans no matter how tumultuous their relationship was at the moment\u2014and sat out of sight in the forest, intending to retreat to a tree when the hour of transformation arrived.</p><p>She sat on the opposite side of the rock formation she used as shelter, out of sight of the pond and thus her foster brothers.</p><p>Brida did not speak much, if at all. The guard captain practiced her sword form and archery for a few hours before grooming the horses and catching a few fish. She kept busy, but she always was within eye-sight of the rock formation.</p><p>Somewhat alone, Elise bit her tongue until it bled to keep herself from screaming in pain as she knit. Tears stung her eyes, and she didn\u2019t bother to wipe them from her face.</p><p>Elise was so involved in her work that she didn\u2019t notice the swan until it was a few feet away from her.</p> <p>Elise stared at the swan. The swan stared back at Elise.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t tell which brother it was, and she leaned back into her rock as he walked a half circle around her before sitting down within kicking range.</p><p>Elise considered getting up and climbing a tree, but the prospect did not seem appealing thanks to her stiff back and sore bottom. Besides, both Steffen and Rune mentioned they couldn\u2019t clearly remember what was going on when they were swans, right? It was most likely that whatever brother this was would forget she was here by the time he transformed.</p><p>After Elise made up her mind and went back to knitting, the swan stood and took a few steps closer before sitting down again. Elise glanced up from her knitting, but did not respond.</p><p>A few minutes later, the swan moved closer again and again, until an hour later, he sat even with Elise, his feathers occasionally brushing her when he used his orange beak to preen his feathers.</p><p>Elise looked at the swan, and the swan looked back to Elise. Realizing how ridiculous they must look\u2014a grubby girl sewing nettles and a swan behaving like a dog\u2014Elise let the corners of her lips curl before she shook her head and returned to knitting.</p><p>\u201cEliiiiiise!\u201d</p><p>\u201cElise,\u201d</p> <p>ELISE!\u201d</p><p>Elise squinted in the dying light\u2014the sun had dipped beyond the horizon but its glow hadn\u2019t completely departed yet, letting Elise knit on. \u201cI think I can finish this tonight,\u201d Elise said, looking at the nettle shirt. She had completed the front half of the shirt and was working on the back half. When that was finished, all that was left to do was to stitch the two pieces together. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It wouldn\u2019t be the prettiest shirt, but Elise guessed it would still break the curse. Even though it had been days since she harvested the first nettles for the shirt, the plants were still green and pliant. That had to be a sign of magic.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been over a week. Are you going to forgive them anytime soon, Princess?\u201d Brida said, looking down at the forest from the branch she draped her body across. (After it became apparent that Elise was going to spend the hour her brothers were human in the trees and out of their grasp, Brida started climbing the tree with her for reasons beyond Elise\u2019s comprehension.) \u201cI already have forgiven them,\u201d Elise said, biting her lip out of habit to keep from crying as she knitted.</p><p>\u201cThen why won\u2019t you speak to them?\u201d Brida asked over a repetitious chorus.</p><p>\u201cBecause I am still furious with them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo they\u2014,\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are my family,\u201d Elise firmly said. \u201cIt\u2019s possible to love family and want to save them and, in the same moment, wish they would choke on a fishbone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are going to make them pay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPay for what? No. I\u2019m avoiding them until I can face them\u2014any of them\u2014without wanting to wrap this shirt around their perfect, smiling faces,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cSo you aren\u2019t avoiding them because of Rune and Falk\u2019s love for you?\u201d</p><p>Elise yanked so hard on the stinging nettle she snapped it. She was silent for a few moments to keep herself from cursing before she grabbed another nettle and slid out her last few loops so she could tie the new plant in. \u201cNo, definitely not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think you\u2019ll marry one of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not want to talk about it,\u201d Elise said, her voice growing high-pitched.</p><p>Brida sat up on her branch so she could face Elise in the purple dusk. \u201cYou honestly did not know, did you?\u201d</p> <p>Elise hunched further into the tree, her neck disappearing into her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cAnd that is why you do not want to face them,\u201d Brida continued.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tie off this end, and then I will need something to cut the remaining stem with,\u201d Elise said, trying to crowd Brida\u2019s irritating, spot-on observations out of her mind.</p><p>\u201cEliiiiiiise!\u201d</p><p>The Arcainian princes still called out.</p><p>When the sun went down two days later, Elise climbed her usual tree alone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to meet the princes at the camp,\u201d Brida said, resting a sheathed sword on her shoulder. \u201cYou have your whistle?\u201d</p><p>Elise nodded.</p> <p>\u201cI will be back once they are swans again,\u201d Brida said, saluting Elise before she strode off through the woods.</p><p>Elise sat in her tree and tried to rearrange her wild, curly locks. The red ribbon was barely enough to pull her hair to the back of her neck, and each day Elise\u2019s hair seemed to grow more unruly.</p><p>Elise fussed with her hair, jumping when she heard a thudding noise. She peered between branches for any sign of her brothers.</p><p>She didn\u2019t see anyone, but the afterglow of the set sun was almost gone.</p><p>Elise climbed to a lower tree branch and crouched there. No one was around, and for the first time since their argument, Elise didn\u2019t hear her foster brothers calling for her.</p><p>In the last bits of light, Elise thought she saw something metal glint on the ground. After another cautionary glance, Elise climbed down her tree, wincing as the rough bark scraped her raw fingers. She crept through the underbrush and pushed aside a fern leaf. The metal was a buckle, like the ones on saddlebags or horse tack.</p><p>Elise blinked and picked up the buckle. Maybe Brida had dropped it.</p><p>\u201cFound you.\u201d</p><p>Elise whirled around and collided with Rune\u2019s chest. She bounced off him but was steadied by another man, Falk.</p><p>\u201cElise,\u201d Falk said as Elise pulled her arms from his grasp.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t mean to frighten you. We just want to speak with you,\u201d Rune said, slowly approaching Elise.</p><p>\u201cWe have much to discuss,\u201d Falk dryly said.</p><p>\u201cWe should explain\u2014,\u201d</p><p>\u201cGAAAAAAAH!\u201d Elise shouted, clamping her hands over her ears.</p><p>\u201cWe need to address the issue, Snowflake,\u201d Falk said, still audible over Elise\u2019s protests.</p><p>\u201cWe never told you we loved you because\u2014,\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis can\u2019t be happening,\u201d Elise said, dropping her hands so she could start marching through the forest. \u201cThis isn\u2019t happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, it is,\u201d Falk said.</p><p>\u201cFather forbid us from talking to you about love until you declared you were ready to marry,\u201d Rune said.</p><p>\u201cRune once attempted to test that rule a year ago,\u201d Falk dryly said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t even get to confess to you before some guards tattled.\u201d</p><p>Elise stopped and turned to stare at her brothers. \u201cA year ago? Wasn\u2019t that the summer you fought a dragon and got that horrid black eye?\u201d she asked, folding her arms across her chest.</p><p>\u201cThe dragon fighting was really more...symbolic,\u201d Rune said.</p><p>\u201cSteffen was the one who gave him the black eye,\u201d Falk helpfully piped in. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLike you faired any better. The only reason Steffen never dealt you a blow is because you are utterly incompetent in terms of friendly communication,\u201d Rune said, his handsome face twisting into a scowl.</p><p>Elise looked back and forth between Rune and Falk before she shook her head. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. She turned on her heels and started marching again.</p><p>\u201cReturning to the original point,\u201d Rune said, easily keeping up. \u201cWhen you finally announced that you were available, Clotilde already had her claws into Father. Steffen told us we could try to pursue you, but it was fairly obvious you would just end up hating us both if we attempted such a thing when you were already feeling the pressure.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Tis true,\u201d Falk said.</p> <p>Elise hopped over a log. \u201cYou\u2019re lying. Both of you are lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know us, Elise. Or at least you know me. I am not a liar,\u201d Rune said.</p><p>\u201cExcept when it comes to your feelings, eh?\u201d Falk said.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Rune snapped.</p><p>\u201cNo, this is impossible. I will tell you why it is impossible,\u201d Elise said, stopping to shaking a finger at the princes. \u201cYou,\u201d she said, stabbing a finger at Falk. \u201cYou hate me. You call me all sorts of sarcastic nicknames that any idiot can tell you use to mock me rather than as a term of endearment. You are a plague on my department, pointing out any perceived mathematical mistake and insisting on breathing down my neck and lingering in my office whenever our departments work together. In no way do you give off the faintest whiff of a man in love. You are as pleasant to me as a bad-tempered porcupine.\u201d</p> <p>Rune looked away to hide his grin, but he did not bother to muffle his snort of amusement.</p><p>\u201cAnd YOU,\u201d Elise said, placing her hands on her hips as she turned to Rune. \u201cYou are worse! Yes, you acted nice to me and cared for me on a more personal level than the rest of our family, but you are an unforgivable flirt! How dare you say that you love me when I have stood next to you for countless parties and heard you flatter and compliment any female that crossed your path. You are the court favorite because you\u2019re handsome and because pretty words fall from your mouth like honey from a beehive!\u201d</p><p>Rune lost his mirth rather quickly. \u201cFalk is popular, too,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cFalk is popular through no actions of his own. The man lives like a monk\u2014I always thought he had taken some sort of vow of celibacy as he seemed to despise the companionship of any marriageable lady. But you! I could accept it, and perhaps encourage, it for the good of our country when you are my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not your broth\u2014,\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut when you claim to be in love with me and think that you have conducted yourself perfectly true to me?\u201d Elise laughed and again started plowing through the darkening forest. \u201cWhat a joke. Besides, look at you! Look at both of you! Matching me with you would be like a duck and a swan pairing up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTechnically right now it would be a human girl and a swan\u2014,\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was supposed to be a metaphor, Falk,\u201d Elise said as she climbed over a log. \u201cBoth of you will marry someone beautiful and enchanting, like Gabrielle. Not a penny-pincher accountant with wild hair, like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou underestimate your beauty, Elise,\u201d Rune said.</p><p>\u201cBesides, the decision is ours. And why would I want someone beautiful and enchanting?\u201d Falk scoffed.</p><p>Rune looked at his brother. \u201cI know we\u2019re rivals, but do you really not notice how you accidentally insult Elise with every compliment you mean to give?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy asking why you want someone beautiful and enchanting you are implying that Elise is neither.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No, I didn\u2019t. Obviously I was asking why I would want someone whose only recommendation is being beautiful. Beauty alone makes a poor companion. Elise is obviously superior because not only is she beautiful, but she can hold a proper conversation and calculate compounding interest at the same time.\u201d</p> <p>Rune sighed as he followed the mute Elise. \u201cI\u2019m not much inclined to help you with Elise ever\u2014why are you so antisocial anyway? But just this once, I shall offer this kernel of wisdom. Women think a great deal about words that have been spoken. It would behoove you to think carefully before blasting Elise with an injurious compliment. If you must say it, at least properly explain it.\u201d</p><p>As the brothers argued, Elise increased her pace. She could see the glow of the campfire just ahead. If she reached the rest of the Arcainian princes, perhaps they would make Rune and Falk be quiet.</p><p>\u201cNot only are you a flirt, but you are also an insufferable know-it-all,\u201d Falk said.</p><p>\u201cI am neither of those things,\u201d Rune said. \u201cAnd I am the only brother out of the lot of us who wasn\u2019t good at school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat does not mean you are not an insufferable know-it-all, Court Favorite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop that,\u201d Rune growled.</p><p>Elise burst through the last layer of trees. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Brida, Steffen, Erick, Mikk, and Nick all looked up from the fire where they were roasting fish.

An intrigued Erick was not necessarily a bad thing, unless he was intrigued with you.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this great? We\u2019ve all made up,\u201d Nick happily said, turning the fish on the spit.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Mikk said.</p> <p>\u201cElise is talking to us again,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>\u201cOnly because she\u2019s mad at Rune and me,\u201d Falk said.</p><p>\u201cAnd that should matter to us because...?\u201d Steffen asked.</p><p>\u201cWelcome back, Elise,\u201d Nick said, also throwing his arms around Elise\u2014nearly knocking heads with Steffen. \u201cSo, you\u2019re probably going to choose Rune or Falk, right? That means you really will be my sister then, just as Mother planned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cW-what?\u201d Elise asked, wide-eyed and sandwiched between the princes.</p><p>\u201cWould anyone care to place a bet on which one she\u2019ll choose?\u201d Erick asked, rubbing his chin as he appraised Rune and Falk.</p> <p>\u201cNormally, Rune would be the best candidate, but she has stood next to him for all of his adult life and watched him dance, compliment, talk to, flatter, and flirt with every lady in the kingdom,\u201d Steffen said.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t helping, brother,\u201d Rune said.</p><p>\u201cWho said I was trying to?\u201d Steffen sweetly asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think, Brida? Who will Elise go for?\u201d Nick asked, abandoning the group hug to sit down next to the silent captain.</p><p>\u201cI think I am glad I am an only child, if you will excuse my frankness, Prince Nickolas,\u201d Brida said.</p><p>Elise pushed her head into Steffen\u2019s shoulder. \u201cThis is so embarrassing,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all in good fun, sister,\u201d Steffen said, patting the top of her head.</p><p>\u201cRight now, the odds for either brother aren\u2019t good,\u201d Erick said, drawing out numbers and figures on the ground with a stick.</p> <p>Mikk glanced over at Rune and Falk. \u201cPray a foreign prince doesn\u2019t sweep into her heart while we are exiled,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo foreign princes. I will mobilize any of you to woo Elise before I will allow that to happen,\u201d Steffen said, hardly noticing when Elise slipped away from him. \u201cWe cannot let our best department head and the official savior of Arcainia slip off to another country. You two had better shape up and start courting,\u201d Steffen said to Falk and Rune.</p><p>\u201cIf that is what you would like, may I recommend that you stop belittling me in front of Elise?\u201d Rune said, his tone light and airy.</p><p>\u201cYou may recommend it, but I will not follow it,\u201d Steffen said.</p><p>The two princes shared lighthearted laughter, although Rune glared daggers at his older brother.</p><p>Elise sat on the ground and took the baked fish on a stick Mikk offered her. \u201cThis is almost as bad as when they were turned into swans,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>When Elise was halfway through the second shirt, she knew she was knitting faster. It wasn\u2019t that her hands hurt less\u2014they hurt more, actually\u2014but Elise\u2019s pain tolerance had grown significantly. It also helped that Falk gave her a new supply of ferns to rub on her hands to ease the welts and scratches every night.</p><p>It was still boring. Elise made the shirts as simple as possible to reduce the knitting time, so it was mind-numbingly repetitive and ugly beyond all imagination thanks to the abundance of knotting Elise had to make in order to tie in the nettle stems.</p><p>None of this changed the fact, though, that Elise was settling in and adjusting to the process, allowing her to knit much faster.</p><p>Elise reached for another stinging nettle stem, only to find she had none left. She set the cape aside and took a fern, rubbing it on her hands as she stretched her legs out in front of her.</p><p>Her swan companion\u2014Elise still didn\u2019t know which prince it was\u2014cocked his head and watched her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Elise offered him a smile before she rolled up the shirt-in-progress and stood, carrying it to her makeshift residence. (It really wasn\u2019t very makeshift anymore. With Brida\u2019s axe and ability to work during daylight hours, she had significantly improved the shelter, crafting a sturdy wall and hanging a length of burlap from the entrance to block out the weather.</p><p>\u201cHAH,\u201d Brida said, shouting fearsomely as she stabbed her spear forward in her daily practice routine.</p><p>When Brida looked to Elise, Elise held up the length of burlap\u2014which she used the carry the stinging nettles after picking them.</p><p>\u201cGoing to get more nettles, Princess?\u201d</p> <p>Elise nodded.</p><p>\u201cTake your whistle and a knife with you,\u201d Brida said before she turned back to her exercises. \u201cHaaRAH!\u201d</p><p>Elise grabbed her wooden whistle and the knife\u2014Brida gave her a real knife so she didn\u2019t have to use her sharp stone, which had lost much of its edge after slicing through more nettles than Elise ever wished to count.</p><p>Elise swung her arms and walked into the forest, smiling when her swan joined her. She had to go farther into the forest than ever before to find nettles as she had plucked every last one of them within a reasonable radius of the pond.</p><p>There was a huge patch of them that Elise had found weeks ago when she was first trying to avoid her brothers. She may as well start there.</p> <p>After a ten-minute walk, Elise found the nettles. She laid out her burlap cloth and started slicing the plants at the very base, digging into the ground to get the maximum length possible.</p><p>The swan walked around the patch, grunting and occasionally flapping his wings. Elise thought he was eating, but she wasn\u2019t entirely certain and concentrated on cutting the nettles. It was extremely painful, as Elise had to wrap her entire hand around the plant instead of gingerly maneuvering it like she could when knitting.</p><p>Elise bit her lip and glared at the plants, silently snarling at the biggest ones that were the hardest to cut. Before placing each plant on the length of burlap, she stripped the leaves and tossed them aside.</p><p>It was about an hour before Elise was satisfied with her gathered bundle. She rolled the burlap twice around her gathered nettles and held the rough cloth as she carried her cargo back, her whistle and knife wedged in the burlap wrap.</p><p>The swan padded along at Elise\u2019s side, occasionally zigzagging back and forth in front of her.</p><p>Elise grinned, infected by the bird\u2019s good mood. She would be able to finish the shirts before her predicted time of midsummer at this rate. With luck, by the end of winter they could take Arcainia back from Clotilde\u2014if Angelique had been cleared of suspicion, that was.</p> <p>Elise froze when she heard a horse neigh.</p><p>Falk\u2019s horse and Brida\u2019s mount were both tethered in their meadow. They were too far away for Elise to hear them so clearly. Elise\u2019s elation left her as she abandoned her path and crept in the direction of the neigh.</p><p>She almost gave up hope of finding the creature when it snorted and pawed the ground.</p><p>Elise, still holding her prickly bundle, peered at it through the trees. The swan companion hissed from behind her ankles. She relaxed when she saw the mount.</p><p>She had been afraid Clotilde had found them and sent soldiers to kill them, but the horse was clearly Verglas bred, thick and furry with more mane and tail than a normal horse would know what to do with. Elise\u2019s shoulders heaved, and she smiled as she studied the plainly dressed horse. It had nothing on it but a saddle, a small saddlebag, and a short bow that was hooked over its rump. It probably belonged to a hunter.</p><p>Elise dropped her bundle.</p><p>A hunter.</p><p>Elise hurtled through the woods, ignoring the horse that spooked at her when she burst out of the tress and the swan that flapped its wings and hissed at her.</p> <p>She almost fell flat when her bare feet landed out on a moss-covered rock, but Elise caught herself and kept running in spite of the burning pain of her bruised foot.</p><p>She had to get back to the pond.</p><p>Most hunters went after big game\u2014deer, boars, and the like. But some members of nobility had a taste for poultry, like wild quail, pheasant, ducks, or swans.</p><p>Branches ripped at Elise\u2019s arms, and brambles scratched her legs, but Elise ran harder. She skid into the clearing around the pond. Six swans were there\u2014the seventh was no doubt safe and angrily following her trail. But where...?</p><p>Elise covered her mouth to choke her gasp. A man garbed in green crouched behind a bush, an arrow notched in his bow.</p><p>A quick look confirmed he was targeting the swan sitting on the shore. It was the smallest swan, and his back was to the hunter. His feathers were poofed around him like a peacock and he admired his reflection in the clear water. It had to be Gerhart.</p><p>Elise couldn\u2019t scream.</p><p>Her heart beat like a pounding drum. She wanted to shout, rail at the hunter, and warn Gerhart, but she couldn\u2019t let a sound escape. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Elise tore across the sandy bank and threw herself at Gerhart just as the bow string twanged with the release of an arrow.</p><p>Elise and Gerhart rolled into the pond, getting thoroughly drenched. Gerhart struggled so much Elise thought he was hit, but when she let him go, he wacked her in the face with his wings and stumbled back a step. Elise turned around to find an arrow embedded in the sandy shore, a small bit of her gray dress pinned beneath it.</p><p>An ocean roared in Elise\u2019s ears for a moment as she realized how close Gerhart had been to dying. Then the hunter spoke.</p><p>\u201cWhat tha\u2019! Girl! Whaddaya think yer doing?\u201d</p> <p>Elise looked at the hunter with a murderous expression. She grabbed a rock and threw it at the hunter, pelting him on the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cOuch, what\u2014ack! I\u2019m goin\u2019, I\u2019m goin\u2019! Ack, yer mad!\u201d the hunter said as he backed away from the pond.</p><p>Elise, driven by anger and absolute fright for her brothers, stalked across the pond shore and grabbed a wooden club Mikk had fashioned out of a sturdy tree branch. She swung it through the air as she ran at the hunter.</p><p>\u201cJust lemme grab ma quiver\u2014ouch\u2014ye snarlin\u2019 mountain cat!\u201d the hunter said, not dodging quite fast enough and getting the tail end of a blow to his stomach.</p><p>By now, the swans realized Elise was upset, and they beat their wings and ran speedily across the shore, hissing and snapping at the cornered hunter.</p> <p>\u201cWitch!\u201d the hunter said, abandoning his quiver before he fled into the woods.</p><p>Elise\u2019s swan companion launched himself from the trees, angrily beating his wings. The rest of the swans hurried to his side, hissing and grunting to each other.</p><p>Elise dropped to her knees and breathed deeply to combat the sudden faintness of her heart.</p><p>Where was Brida? Wasn\u2019t she supposed to guard? What use was she if she wandered off like that? It wasn\u2019t like Elise could call her or something...the whistle.</p><p>Elise held back a groan and pounded the ground with one hand. She forgot her wooden whistle with her knife and the burlap wrapped nettles. Brida was going to kill her.</p><p>In the pond, Gerhart shook out his feathers while several other swans shoved their orange beaks into Elise\u2019s wild hair and pulled on her curls.</p> <p>Elise unsteadily swallowed. If Brida didn\u2019t kill her, her brothers would.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>Steffen drummed his fingers on the leather saddle pack draped across his lap. \u201cYou forgot the whistle Brida made you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI apologize,\u201d Elise said, avoiding his eyes as she stood in front of him.</p><p>Steffen sighed. \u201cI just want to keep you safe, Elise. It\u2019s an impossible task out here, and we\u2019ve done nothing but put you in jeopardy, but our curse isn\u2019t worth your life.\u201d</p><p>Elise mutely took the gentle scolding.</p><p>\u201cIt was unfortunate that Brida was out gathering wood when the huntsman came, but it was only the best of luck that the huntsman was, apparently, a weak-spined fellow, and you were able to chase him off with nothing but rocks and a wooden club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a host of hissing swans,\u201d Erick added.</p> <p>\u201cWe hardly count, as we are unable to do anything,\u201d Steffen said.</p><p>\u201cSpare Elise the lecture. We should be hailing her a hero. She saved Gerhart,\u201d Nick called from the edge of the pond where he sat in the darkness with a fishing pole.</p><p>Steffen looked unconvinced, and Elise saw another lecture in his eyes.</p><p>It was to her relief that Rune stepped in.</p><p>\u201cRegardless of what happened, everyone is safe. Elise will not make that mistake again. Will you, Elise?\u201d the golden-tongued Rune said.</p><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cSee? She will be careful to carry her whistle with her from now on. There\u2019s no need to further lecture her. Why don\u2019t we talk about ways we could prevent this in the future, and Elise can get washed up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose,\u201d Steffen frowned.</p><p>Elise hastily stood and trotted off into the darkness before the eldest prince could rethink his decision. \u201cThank you, Rune,\u201d Elise whispered as she made her way around the pond in the dark.</p><p>She knelt next to the pond and scrubbed at her arms and face after splashing herself with water. She gave her face a final rinse and almost jumped out of her dress when Gerhart appeared next to her, carrying a torch.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Elise blinked. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you save me?</p><p>Elise wiped her hands off on her grubby dress. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I save you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been nothing but horrid to you for years. I have mocked you and snubbed you and done everything in my power to look down at you. Why didn\u2019t you let the hunter kill me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore you were horrid, we were great friends. I know you aren\u2019t a bad person, Hart, although I have no idea what made you change. Besides, even if you went on being horrid to me for the rest of our lives, you\u2019re still my brother,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cI was jealous of you,\u201d Gerhart said. \u201cBefore Clotilde, Father acted like the sun rose and fell with you. Everyone gushed over you. They talked about how perfect you were.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Elise brushed off her dress. \u201cBe that as it may, I never did anything to scorn you or to make you scorn me, did I?\u201d</p><p>Gerhart was mute.</p><p>\u201cI thought as much. Good evening, Hart,\u201d Elise said, turning to go back to the campfire.</p><p>\u201cI was scared,\u201d he blurted out. \u201cYes, I was jealous, but I was cowardly and weak-willed.\u201d</p> <p>Elise paused. \u201cIn what way were you cowardly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have told them to bugger off. I should have been stronger. We could have stayed the idyllic brother and sister, but I was too weak. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThem?\u201d Elise asked.</p><p>Gerhart looked off to the side, avoiding Elise\u2019s gaze.</p><p>\u201cHart.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRune and Falk,\u201d he finally said, shrinking under Elise\u2019s looming shadow.</p><p>\u201cWhat did they do?\u201d Elise asked, her voice scratchy as she turned her head at an almost unnatural angle to look at her two supposed suitors.</p><p>\u201cWhen you turned fifteen, Rune took me to this cave I had been begging to explore with him for months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile we were there, we had a talk,\u201d Gerhart said, shifting uneasily.</p><p>The words were pulled unwillingly from him, but whenever he glanced at Elise he seemed to realize she posed a greater threat than his older brothers.</p> <p>\u201cRune said I was growing up, and I needed to man up and end my childish friendship with you.

He said if I didn\u2019t stop clinging to you, he would leave me there.\u201d</p><p>Elise was silent, but her building fury was obvious based on the twitch of her eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cEven though they did that, it was my choice to break off our friendship. I was angry and humiliated, and I felt like I didn\u2019t have the strength to go against them. It was because of my weakness that I treated you abominably. I hated that I couldn\u2019t oppose them,\u201d Gerhart said.</p><p>\u201cHart, you were thirteen!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat shouldn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>Elise threw her hands in the air. \u201cCome with me,\u201d she said, grabbing Gerhart\u2019s wrist and pulling him back to the campfire. \u201cRune, Falk,\u201d she snarled. \u201cYou two intimidated Hart when he was thirteen, telling him to stay away from me?\u201d</p> <p>Rune rolled his eyes. \u201cI should have known he would eventually squeal,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cI counted on it,\u201d Falk said, grinding up herbs on the top of a flat rock with the bone handle of a knife.</p><p>\u201cHow can you two say that? Furthermore, how could you do something so cruel to your little brother?\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cIf we hadn\u2019t, it would have been impossible to pry you from him,\u201d Falk said.</p><p>Rune shot him a look before he tried soothing Elise. \u201cElise, you\u2019re taking this too seriously. We\u2019re men. If we have a problem, we punch one another. It\u2019s just how we handle things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make it right,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s true,\u201d Nick said, fingering his broken nose.</p><p>Elise reached out and grabbed Rune\u2014who was closest\u2014by the collar of his shirt. \u201cYou don\u2019t get it. Hart was angelic before he scorned me. He was so cute and adorable. I will never get those years back,\u201d she said before pushing Rune away and ringing her arms around Hart\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>\u201cNow he\u2019s a big teenager. I missed three years of my only little sibling\u2019s life because of you,\u201d she snarled.</p><p>Gerhart was pink-cheeked and wouldn\u2019t look his brothers in the eye.</p><p>\u201cWell. That plan backfired on you,\u201d Erick observed.</p><p>\u201cYou two are worse than I thought,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>Rune sighed and sat down next to Falk. \u201cWe should have gone another route\u2014found him a girl to obsess over maybe.\u201d</p><p>Falk continued to grind his herbs. \u201cWe won\u2019t make the same mistake a second time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019ve scolded you so now the matter is over?\u201d Elise asked, planting her hands on her hips.</p><p>\u201cHardly. You will very likely rail at us for the rest of our days, but it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Falk said.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt took Gerhart out of the running for your affections, didn\u2019t it? Our dear little brother apparently has a thing for Onella, one of my pretty subordinates. He is besotted with her. Considering his admiration, I am surprised he had the courage to tell you of our childhood games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGames?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially as Onella happens to be one of my personal assistants who is extremely loyal to me,\u201d Falk continued.</p><p>\u201cFalk,\u201d Gerhart complained. \u201cI am not smitten with Onella.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are.

Extend your hands, please. Thank you,\u201d he said before he started smearing the green paste his ground up plants made on Elise\u2019s hands.</p> <p>Brida watched the process for a moment. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, I believe I should start cleaning the fish.

If you are hurt, I will always do my best to see that you are mended.\u201d</p><p>Elise found that she was speechless.</p><p>Falk smeared the last of the past on Elise\u2019s hands. \u201cKeep it on until we turn back into swans. Then you can wash it off in the pond. It should provide relief through the night,\u201d Falk said before he stood and retreated to his brothers\u2014who were still teasing Gerhart.</p><p>Elise watched him go and shook her head. \u201cMen.\u201d</p><p>The last of the Verglas spring rains beat heavily the following week. During that time, Elise and Brida huddled in their slightly drafty but dry shelter. They left it only to check on the swans and the horses, so Elise was able to work faster than ever. She finished the second shirt and got a good start on the third before the rain ended.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve run out of nettles,\u201d Elise said the last night of the rain\u2014it was impossibly crowded in the shelter with the seven princes to cram inside as well, but at least it was warmer.</p> <p>\u201cWait until the ground dries a little before you look for more,\u201d Nick said. \u201cTrying to find them in all this muck will do you no good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut won\u2019t they be easier to pull out of the ground right now?\u201d Elise asked.</p><p>\u201cIt would be nothing but a great deal messier. You are better off waiting until the ground is soft but not moist,\u201d Falk said.</p><p>\u201cBut that could be days,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cA few extra days as swans won\u2019t harm us, although your loyalty warms me,\u201d Rune said, kissing the top of Elise\u2019s head.</p><p>It was a gesture Elise was familiar with, but the arm he slipped around her waist was new. Added to the claim that he loved her, Elise found herself blushing.</p><p>\u201cHeel,\u201d Steffen said, carelessly yanking Rune backwards by the collar of his sparkling white shirt. \u201cKeep your paws to yourself, mutt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you continue to insert yourself where you are unwanted?\u201d Rune asked Steffen.</p><p>\u201cMostly because I can,\u201d Steffen said.</p><p>\u201cSuch a shock,\u201d Falk said.</p><p>\u201cWait until it\u2019s dry,\u201d Mikk summarized for Elise\u2019s benefit as the rest of their siblings entered the fray.</p><p>\u201cIf you say so,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>It was another three days before Elise could walk without her bare feet sinking into mud and muck. During the three days of mud, Elise fell several times, so on the first day of warm weather and solid footing, Elise plunged into the pond.</p><p>She dove in with her dress on and her hair unbound. When she popped up for air a swan regally padded by, Steffen probably. Elise watched the swan before she tried scrubbing at the worst of her dress stains while standing in the water.</p><p>When her teeth started to chatter, Elise clambered back onto shore, ringing water out of her dress and hair.</p><p>\u201cYou should dry off before you get yourself sick,\u201d Brida said, chopping a sturdy tree limb with her axe. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Elise sneezed twice and flicked water off her skin as she walked past the shelter, pausing to grab her whistle, knife, and burlap cloth.</p><p>Properly armed, Elise hiked a short way into the woods. She could still hear the noises her brothers made as swans\u2014the sound their flapping wings produced was quite loud\u2014when she found a boulder situated in a spot of sunshine.</p><p>Elise dropped the burlap cloth and set the knife and whistle on the boulder before she climbed it, sunning herself on the warm surface as she attempted to comb her wild hair with her fingers.</p><p>As her hair dried, her bouncy curls sprang into their usual tangled ringlets. Elise abandoned the ribbon she used to keep her hair tied in a low ponytail at the nape of her neck and fluffed her hair, hoping to get it to dry quicker. The early summer air was cooler than she estimated, and between her sopping dress and wet head, she was getting a chill.</p> <p>Once she felt she had sufficiently untangled her wild curls, Elise tried wringing more water from her dress. Both the morning sun and the rock warmed Elise, making her damp situation bearable, and in less than an hour, Elise was more or less dry.</p><p>Elise tossed her curly mop of hair over her shoulders as she reached for her ribbon, intending to pull her hair back so she could nettle hunt without it flapping in her face.</p><p>She froze when she heard a male voice say, \u201cSo it is true. There is maiden as lovely as a summer day who has taken up residence at Farsund Pond.\u201d</p><p>Elise slowly lifted her eyes up to stare at a handsome young man who had soundlessly crept up on her. The fine velvet of his tunic was too expensive to make him anything less than a noble. He had baby fine blonde hair and grey eyes that were the same intense color as frothy rapids.</p><p>Elise flattened her lips and reached for her whistle as she kept eye contact with the strange man.</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t hurt you,\u201d he said, lifting both of his hands. \u201cI\u2019m worried for you. How can you survive out here, alone?\u201d</p><p>Elise, obviously, was silent.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t you speak? You can trust me,\u201d he said, taking a step closer to her. \u201cWhere are you from? I\u2019ve never seen anyone like you. Your hair is beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Elise slid off her rock, clutching her whistle. She was careful not to place her back to the man as she retreated to the pond.</p><p>\u201cEasy, easy,\u201d the man said, as if Elise were a wild horse he needed to soothe. \u201cDo you want to leave this place? I could take you somewhere warm. You could sleep in a real bed and eat only the best foods. Don\u2019t you want to come?\u201d</p><p>Elise shook her head, making the young man smile.</p> <p>\u201cSo you can understand, then? You aren\u2019t dumb. Nor are you a witch, like that foolish hunter said you were,\u201d the man said. \u201cCome with me. I will protect you.\u201d</p><p>Elise shook her head and kept backing up.</p><p>\u201cYou will be safe, I promise. Just trust me,\u201d the man said before lunging forward and grabbing Elise\u2019s wrist.</p><p>Elise shoved her whistle between her teeth and tried punching the man with her free hand. He caught her jab and within seconds had her flung over his shoulders like a sack of potatoes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing this for your own good,\u201d the man said as Elise struggled.</p><p>Elise took in a deep breath of air, positioned her mouth by the man\u2019s ear, and blew her whistle so hard she made her ears pop.</p><p>\u201cOw, what was that for?\u201d the man said, dropping Elise to clamp his hands to his ears.</p><p>Elise hit the ground with a thud. She rolled away, getting grass stains all over her dress, and scrambled to her feet, blasting another note on her whistle.</p> <p>She needn\u2019t have bothered. Brida came tearing through the woods, a spear held above her head and roaring like an angry bear. Behind her was a train of four snow white swans. The swans flapped their wings and strained their necks while they hissed.</p><p>\u201cGet away from her!\u201d Brida shouted, sounding scarier than ever as she leveled her spear at the intruder.</p><p>\u201cWhat? What\u2019s going on?\u201d the man said.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do to her?\u201d Brida asked, suspiciously eyeing the grass stains on Elise\u2019s dress as Elise passed her, aiming to stand with the swans.</p><p>\u201cNothing! I thought she was alone in the woods so I was going to take her back to the palace so she could find shelter,\u201d the man said.</p><p>\u201cLikely story!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true. Who are you that you don\u2019t recognize me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>The man thumped the stag symbol embroidered on the front of his tunic. \u201cI am Prince Toril, the only child of King Torgen and heir to the throne of Verglas,\u201d he said. \u201cIn case you didn\u2019t know it is a capital offense to brandish a weapon at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoyal or not, it\u2019s an offense to humanity to manhandle a girl,\u201d Brida spat.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t manhandling her! Please, there must be some way we can come to an agreement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave right now and that will be a proper agreement,\u201d Brida said.</p><p>\u201cThis forest is mine; you can hardly force me out of it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Brida held the spear in a throwing position. \u201cOh?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cExcept for today,\u201d the prince hastily said. \u201cI can see I have upset your...delicate nerves. I shall take my leave now and come back at a better time,\u201d he said, starting to back up.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come back,\u201d Brida warned. \u201cYou aren\u2019t wanted here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you have made perfectly clear, madam,\u201d the prince said before darting out sight. \u201cBut I will be back. Count on it.\u201d</p> <p>Brida held an arm in front of Elise as she listened to the man stumble through the woods. (Elise had to wonder how she missed his arrival if that was how he usually moved.) When the noises faded, Brida lowered her weapon and her arm. \u201cWell done, F\u00fcrstin,\u201d Brida said before she plunged through the four troubled swans and headed back to the camp.</p><p>Elise followed, the swans in tow, with wide eyes. She had never imagined there would be a day when Brida would praise her.</p><p>Elise glanced over her shoulder in the direction Prince Toril had disappeared. What was he doing this far south? Elise shivered in the cool summer air, hoping he would forget about her, forget about Brida, and forget about her wild swans.</p><p>\u201cPrince Toril? What could he possibly want with Elise?\u201d Nick asked as he sat next to Brida.</p><p>\u201cI could think of several things,\u201d Rune frowned. \u201cDid you scare him enough?\u201d he asked Brida\u2014who was telling her part of the story.</p> <p>\u201cIf I had frightened him anymore, he very likely would have wet his royal trousers,\u201d Brida dryly said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s our Brida,\u201d Nick chimed in.</p><p>Rune nodded and paced by the fire.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we should move,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to. The prince of Verglas is not known for his sharp wit. He will never figure out who you are. I doubt we are in any real danger except for extreme annoyance if he keeps popping up,\u201d Steffen said.</p><p>\u201cHe will be leaving to go north to the capital soon,\u201d Falk said.</p> <p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d Elise asked.</p><p>\u201cBased on his clothes, he\u2019s obviously on a hunting trip. Even though he is flippant, he is the only heir to the throne and as such would have to be in court most of the time,\u201d Falk said.</p><p>\u201cBased on his clothes? You remember what he looked like? You were one of the swans that came with Brida?\u201d Elise asked.</p><p>Falk shifted and looked, for the first time in years, uncomfortable. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Before Elise could further pursue this interesting reveal, Rune, who still paced, said, \u201cI don\u2019t care. First the hunter and now this prince\u2014I will not let us put Elise\u2019s life in danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assure you, Prince Rune, I will do my best to protect Princess Elise,\u201d Brida said.</p><p>Rune pressed his lips together and tried to hang his thumbs on a sword belt that wasn\u2019t there. His hazel eyes were dim and tinted with frustration.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not enough, is it?\u201d Brida asked, her voice hollow.</p> <p>Rune looked away and flexed his hands.</p><p>Erick cleared his throat, drawing Elise\u2019s attention to hm. He discreetly tipped his head in Rune\u2019s direction and made a shooing gesture.</p><p>Elise hesitated for a moment, wondering why of all her brothers it would be Erick to instruct her to talk with Rune.</p><p>\u201cI should check on the horses\u2014they haven\u2019t been offered water in a few hours. Come with me, Rune?\u201d Elise asked.</p><p>\u201cCertainly,\u201d Rune said, rallying a smile before he followed Elise out of the bright campfire circle.</p><p>\u201cI have lost track of the days, but it must be summer by now,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cIt is. It is still quite cool here, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree. I knew our country has a warmer climate, but I still need to cover up when I sleep. At home it\u2019s usually quite hot by now,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>Rune shrugged. \u201cVerglas has been a colder country for centuries. Even its neighbors don\u2019t get the same snowfall and cool summers. Do you want me to lead both of the horses?\u201d Rune asked as they approached the shaky wooden fence that boxed the horses in for the night.</p><p>\u201cNo, Falk\u2019s horse and I have come to an understanding. And standing with them doesn\u2019t bother me so much as being on their backs does,\u201d Elise said, reaching for the rope halter Brida had fashioned for Falk\u2019s horse after her arrival. She slipped it on over the gelding\u2019s face and, using a rope, led him from the pen to the pond.</p><p>\u201cSo what did you want to discuss?\u201d Rune asked.</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrida religiously waters the horses; your chore was just an excuse.\u201d</p><p>Elise watched Falk\u2019s horse lip the water. \u201cYes,\u201d she agreed before looking up at Rune. \u201cI wanted to ask what is wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are troubled tonight.\u201d</p><p>Rune laughed. \u201cElise, I think anyone in our situation would be troubled.\u201d</p><p>Elise shook her head. \u201cNo, something has especially bothered you this evening.\u201d</p><p>Rune placed a hand on Brida\u2019s horse and stroked her glossy shoulder. \u201cI can\u2019t help but think that I have failed you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said Toril had you slung over his shoulder. If you didn\u2019t have that whistle...,\u201d Rune trailed off and ran a hand through his gold hair. \u201cIt\u2019s not supposed to be like this,\u201d he finally said.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to be able protect you. I am\u2014I\u2019ve always wanted to be your hero. But right now, I am nothing.\u201d</p> <p>Elise glanced at Falk\u2019s horse to make sure it did not seem particularly inclined to walk off before she looped its lead rope across its back. \u201cThat isn\u2019t true,\u201d Elise said, warily circling around Brida\u2019s horse\u2014knowing the captain her horse was probably bad tempered and trained to bite\u2014to reach Rune.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t weigh my affections for you based on the present. Yes, you didn\u2019t save me today, but there\u2019s at least a hundred other times you have saved me,\u201d Elise said, clasping Rune\u2019s free hand between hers. \u201cWhen I was first moved into the royal wing of Brandis and got lost for half a day, you found me. When I was thirteen and I came down with that horrid cold, you stayed with me until I got better\u2014you refused to leave unlike everyone else so you caught my cold after I was better.\u201d</p><p>Rune cracked a smile at the recollection.</p><p>\u201cThe summer before Mother died we went on a family picnic. I accidentally disturbed the nest of two rock griffons. You kept the male from slaughtering me,\u201d Elise continued. \u201cLast year, I nearly turned my office inside out because Lord Huge\u2019s account was short some money, and I couldn\u2019t figure out why. You staked him out and caught him in the act of embezzling. You were the department champion for a full season after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder if Lord Huge has recovered from that fright,\u201d Rune said.</p> <p>\u201cThe point is this: I don\u2019t love you because of what you do for me; I love you because you are steadfast and loyal and good,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>Rune gave Elise a dazzling smile. \u201cYou love me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that way,\u201d Elise was quick to say. \u201cI mean, I do, but not... romantic.\u201d</p><p>Rune sighed. \u201cI suppose that would be too much to hope for,\u201d he said, letting Brida\u2019s horse go so he could graze Elise\u2019s cheek with his fingertips.</p><p>\u201cUm, yes,\u201d Elise said, looking away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about the flirting, Elise.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUm?\u201d Elise said, trying to take a step backwards as she let go of Rune\u2019s hand. (That was a mistake.) Rune slid his free hand around Elise\u2019s waist as he breeched the new gap between them. \u201cI did it because Steffen ordered me to be pleasant, but also because I was hoping to make you jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cC-could you back up a little? Maybe?\u201d Elise said, using her pointer finger to poke Rune in the chest.</p><p>Rune dropped his head until his forehead rested against Elise\u2019s. \u201cI miss you fiercely whenever I leave for my heroic duties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhaaa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you miss me?\u201d Rune asked, his breath brushing Elise\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cOf c-course I miss you.\u201d</p><p>When Rune tangled his hand in Elise\u2019s wild hair, Elise had enough. \u201cNo, no. This is yours, I believe,\u201d she said, unhooking his arm from around her waist and pushing it into his chest. She jumped away from him and semi-violently brushed herself off before shaking like a wet dog.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you smirking at?\u201d she asked when she turned to see Rune grinning widely.</p> <p>\u201cI was just thinking,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAbout?\u201d Elise snapped, angry that she let Rune push her off balance.</p><p>\u201cIf being close to me makes you blush and upsets you so, you cannot possibly see me as your brother,\u201d Rune said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m still a viable marriage option,\u201d Rune said, his grin turning into a pleased smile.</p><p>All the blood in Elise\u2019s face drained. \u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still have a chance,\u201d Rune said before patting Brida\u2019s mare and leading her back to the pen.</p><p>Elise was silent for a few moments. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d she called, suddenly remembering herself as she scrambled to grab Falk\u2019s horse.</p><p>\u201cI do. As sure as the sun shines, I do,\u201d Rune laughed.</p><p>\u201cGo turn into a swan and eat a bug,\u201d Elise muttered.</p><p>Rune responded with a joyful, light-hearted laugh.</p><p>Elise and her swan companion sat together and watched Brida perform her morning practice routine.</p><p>Elise was shocked when, as she tied another nettle stem into the shirt, Brida dropped the sword she was practicing with.</p><p>\u201cYou honestly did not know Prince Rune loved you, did you?\u201d</p><p>Elise eyed Brida above the shirt and suspiciously pulled her head back.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no use denying it. Prince Rune has mooned over you for years. I always thought you were malicious for ignoring his feelings. Did you really never see them?\u201d</p><p>Elise absentmindedly knitted as she thought. Had she ever noticed the way Rune\u2014or Falk\u2014treated her was different? To a certain extent, yes. Falk wasn\u2019t vocally rude to people as he was to Elise, and Rune was kind to all, but even Elise knew she was special to him just as he was special to her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But love?</p><p>No, Elise never saw that coming, had never dared to even think about it.

She wanted to be happy, yes, so she would be careful in selecting her marriage partner, but she never thought anyone\u2014Mertein included\u2014would love her with passion.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know,\u201d Brida said.</p> <p>Elise shook her head.</p><p>Brida scratched the back of her neck and sighed. \u201cYou understand that he\u2014they, really, I suppose\u2014is devoted to you? Ignoring Prince Rune\u2019s and Prince Falk\u2019s feelings doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re going to go away. Nor is it fair to the princes to reject them by not even acknowledging them.\u201d</p><p>Elise looked pained and gestured at Brida. What was she to do?</p><p>Brida snorted. \u201cAs if I would know,\u201d she said, picking up her sword again. She glanced at the swan and returned her attention to Elise. \u201cBut why not give them a chance? Let them both court you.\u201d</p><p>Elise stared at Brida with wide eyes and clutched the shirt to her chest regardless of the burning nettles.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like they\u2019re going to eat you,\u201d Brida said.</p><p>Elise nodded vigorously.</p><p>\u201cYou have got some disastrous notions of love, Princess,\u201d Brida said before slashing the air with her sword.</p><p>Elise shrugged and slowly went back to knitting.</p><p>\u201cOne thing is for sure: you underestimate Prince Falk\u2019s feelings for you,\u201d Brida grunted.</p><p>Elise looked up at her with disbelieving eyes.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying this just because I admire Prince Rune,\u201d Brida said, rolling her eyes. \u201cI mean it. Prince Rune is your most obvious supporter, but Prince Falk...He has your back.\u201d</p><p>Elise tilted her head.</p><p>\u201cWell, who do you think is sitting with you right now?\u201d Brida asked, pointing to Elise\u2019s swan companion with her sword.</p><p>Elise looked at the swan, and the swan looked back at Elise.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not Prince Rune. He can barely control his swan self. Who else do you think would follow you around like that?\u201d Brida asked.</p><p>Elise was genuinely starting to wish Brida wasn\u2019t so free with her words as she looked away from the swan. She didn\u2019t want to know which Arcainian Prince it was that sat with her for most of the day.</p><p>\u201cI know we aren\u2019t friends, and we haven\u2019t been on the best of terms\u2014which I regret,\u201d Brida said. \u201cWhat I mean is this: could you be satisfied with a Mertein when a man like Prince Falk or Prince Rune would give anything to have you?\u201d</p><p>Elise scowled. Even if he had jilted her, Mertein was still a nice boy.</p> <p>Brida waved her hand through the air. \u201cYes, your past sweetheart was the nicest sort of man. He didn\u2019t have a temper\u2014which is an admirable trait\u2014and he cared for his family. But could you see him loving you so much he would follow you around all day as a big white bird? Would someone like Mertein be upset and disappointed with themselves \u2018cause they can\u2019t rescue you?\u201d</p><p>Elise looked away from Brida\u2019s prying eyes.</p><p>\u201cConsider it, F\u00fcrstin,\u201d Brida said, walking off.</p><p>Elise watched the captain go with wide eyes, wondering what had gotten in to her... although she did have a point. Elise looked at her swan companion, who was preening his feathers. Which prince was it that stayed with her all day long?</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>It was unfortunate, but Prince Toril was back the day after Elise\u2019s one-sided conversation with Brida.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t blow your whistle,\u201d he said, this time happening upon Elise as she knitted a few feet from the pond shore.</p><p>About half of the swans abandoned their usual pursuits and floated near Elise, watching Prince Toril with coal-colored eyes.</p><p>\u201cErm, yes. I remember I made an acquaintance with your swans last time, in addition to your bear-like maid,\u201d Prince Toril said, jumping backwards when one of the swans hissed at him.</p><p>Elise stood and planted her hands on her hips so she could properly stare the prince down.</p><p>\u201cI brought food this time,\u201d Prince Toril said, holding a cloth bag. He reached inside to pluck out a loaf of bread.</p><p>Elise pinched the whistle between her lips but didn\u2019t blow\u2014Brida would be back shortly. She was exercising her horse at the moment. The bread was very tempting, since her arrival at the pond, Elise had lived on nothing but fish, berries, and whatever vegetation Falk found.</p><p>Prince Toril broke off an end. \u201cDon\u2019t you want some?\u201d he coaxed, offering the piece to her.</p><p>Prince Toril did not strike Elise as being smart enough to poison and/or drug food, so she cautiously took the bread, inspecting it for any odd smells or colors worked into the dough. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBy the heavens, what have you done to your hands?!\u201d</p><p>Elise almost dropped the bread in surprise. She glanced down at her hands, which Prince Toril stared at in morbid fascination, before tucking them behind her back.</p><p>Although Falk\u2019s pastes and plants lessened the pain when Elise was not knitting, they did nothing to improve her hands\u2019 appearance. Her long, slender fingers were marred and swollen\u2014her nails broken and cracked. The tops and palms of her hands were covered in oozing welts, and the skin of her hands was tinted red\u2014whether it was from the nettles or the constant pinpricks that leaked blood, Elise didn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cHas that bear-maid of yours been mistreating you?\u201d Prince Toril demanded.</p> <p>Elise shook her head and ate her first bite of bread before she motioned to her knitting materials.</p><p>Prince Toril briefly crouched and prodded the green, prickly shirt Elis was working on. \u201cYou\u2019re knitting with nettles,\u201d he said before hopping upright to avoid getting nipped by a swan. \u201cMaybe Ludger was right. Are you crazy?\u201d</p><p>Elise shrugged at Prince Toril, picked up her knitting, and walked further up shore with her flock of swan chaperones.</p><p>Prince Toril trekked around her for a few minutes, until Brida returned.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d Brida said, narrowing her eyes as she slid from her horse\u2019s back.</p> <p>\u201cGood day to you, madam. I have returned as promised, and I brought provisions,\u201d Prince Toril said, holding the bag of food out in front of him.</p><p>Brida ignored the offering. \u201cHas he been bothering you?\u201d Brida asked Elise, sliding her sword out of its scabbard with an ominous swish.</p><p>Elise shook her head and held up the hunk of bread she still had left.</p><p>Brida took the bread and sniffed it before she handed it back to Elise. She frowned at Prince Toril. \u201cLeave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadam,\u201d Prince Toril protested. \u201cI have come here to offer you sanctuary and protection. It is clear that the two of you are travel companions of a sort. But living in the wild is not safe for two innocent ladies.\u201d</p><p>When Brida extended her sword at him, Prince Toril hastily added, \u201cEven one as dangerous and well-armed as you.\u201d</p> <p>Brida sniffed in contempt.</p><p>\u201cThe invitation is genuine,\u201d Prince Toril insisted. \u201cBut we are leaving tomorrow, so you shall have to make up your mind quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not leaving,\u201d Brida said.</p><p>\u201cThese woods you live in belong to my father. He won\u2019t suffer your presence very long,\u201d Prince Toril said.</p><p>\u201cThe only way he\u2019ll even know of our presence is if you or that big-mouthed hunter mention it,\u201d Brida said.</p><p>\u201cThat may be so, but I still insist that you return home with me. Both of you will be very comfortable in the palace. You can go on knitting with prickly plants and... being prickly in general,\u201d Prince Toril said.</p><p>\u201cI think it is time for you to return home, Prince Toril.\u201d</p><p>Prince Toril braved the swans to pass Brida the sack of food. \u201cVery well, but please think about it. That is all I ask.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, sure,\u201d Brida dryly said. She muttered under her breath as Prince Toril hurried back into the forest. \u201cPrancing do-gooder. We will mention it to your brothers tonight, F\u00fcrstin, but I can\u2019t see them agreeing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a wonderful idea,\u201d Steffen said.</p><p>Everyone turned to stare at him.</p><p>\u201cThink about it for a moment,\u201d Steffen said.</p><p>Erick reached for his missing glasses before he made do with rubbing his temple. \u201cElise would be safe, fed better, and given more comfortable quarters to work in. She\u2019ll have Brida with her to talk on her behalf, too,\u201d he listed.</p><p>\u201cBut everyone knows the King of Verglas is off his rocker,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>\u201cVerglas is the only country with an organized, accepted guild for assassins,\u201d Mikk said, exhausting his supply of words for the day.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be living with a madman,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t that bring less attention to her actions, though?\u201d Gerhart asked, sitting next to Elise. He blanched and turned to her. \u201cNo offense; it\u2019s not like you want to do this.\u201d</p><p>Elise smiled. \u201cI know what you mean. If the king really is mad, the people will not think my knitting is at all noteworthy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadmen are unpredictable,\u201d Falk said, his voice chilly with disapproval.</p><p>\u201cPrince Dimwit doesn\u2019t know Elise is the princess of Arcainia. He isn\u2019t going to invite her to the royal table or anything. In fact, I would say it is safe to assume that Elise will never see King Torgen,\u201d Steffen said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re gambling that Elise will be safe in the palace of a tyrant. King Torgen is not known for his kindness. It isn\u2019t safe there,\u201d Rune said.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t safe for her out here, either,\u201d Steffen snapped. \u201cI don\u2019t revel in the idea, but if she\u2019s separated from Brida, Elise is an easy mark for anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could protect her,\u201d Rune said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re swans, in case you\u2019ve forgotten,\u201d Steffen said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe have been unusually lucky that no one has discovered Elise before now,\u201d Erick acknowledged.</p><p>\u201cI believe I have done a suitable job of protecting Princess Elise since my arrival,\u201d Brida stiffly said.</p><p>\u201cOf course you have,\u201d Nick said, quick to defend her.</p><p>\u201cBrida has done a fantastic job,\u201d Elise said, \u201cBut there is truth in what Steffen says. I have no defensive skills. I could rip a country to shreds or build it up to the sky if I had access to its treasury, but I am not learned in any kind of weapon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou want to go with Prince Toril?\u201d Rune asked, looking as betrayed as if she had stabbed him in the gut.</p><p>\u201cNo. Truthfully I don\u2019t know which option is better. I am merely acknowledging my limitations,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cElise should stay here,\u201d Rune said. \u201cOnly Erick and possibly Gerhart are siding with you, Steffen. We have no real reason to move Elise.\u201d</p><p>Brida shifted uncomfortably on the log she sat on.</p><p>Falk flicked his eyes in her direction. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPrince Steffen may be right,\u201d Brida slowly acknowledged.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Mikk asked.</p><p>Brida rearranged the stack of firewood placed next to her before she replied. \u201cSoldiers from Arcainia have been dispatched to find F\u00fcrstin Elise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Nick yelped. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know,\u201d Mikk asked, his eyebrows sinking over his eyes.</p><p>Brida bit her lip.</p> <p>\u201cCaptain Meier,\u201d Mikk said.</p><p>\u201cI met one of the squad captains while exercising my horse today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t think to tell us before now?\u201d Rune demanded.</p><p>Brida winced but did not defend herself. \u201cNone of Arcainia\u2019s soldiers would willingly look for F\u00fcrstin, much less bring her back to Arcainia, but Clotilde smartened up. She sent a squad of soldiers only after she took their families captive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this fellow captain just volunteered this information? You don\u2019t find that suspicious?\u201d Falk scoffed.</p><p>\u201cThe captain said he trusted no harm would come to the families\u2014before his squad left, Princess Gabrielle contacted him to let him she would free Clotilde\u2019s civilian captives. They aren\u2019t really looking for F\u00fcrstin Elise,\u201d Brida said.</p><p>Steffen sniffed. \u201cAt least Gabi is managing to do something useful,\u201d he scoffed.</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d Mikk prodded Brida.</p> <p>Brida looked at the ground. \u201cBut the captain expected soon Clotilde would send forth a squad who would eagerly search out F\u00fcrstin. Apparently she has been working her magic arts on a few soldiers, and they are just as besotted with her as King Henrik is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that changes everything,\u201d Erick said.</p><p>Nick cracked his knuckles. \u201cElise will have to go with Toril.\u201d</p><p>Mikk nodded.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we could follow Prince Toril and ditch him at the outskirts of a large city,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>Steffen scowled. \u201cNo, it won\u2019t work out well. By inviting us to the palace, he will place us under his protection, and as scant as that protection is, even besotted soldiers would think twice before dragging you back home. Besides, we do have a grip on Verglas, should we need to use it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA grip?\u201d Gerhart said.</p><p>\u201cTwo years ago, I bought a large portion of Verglas\u2019s governmental debt,\u201d Elise said. \u201cWe could force their good behavior by making the debt due. All the same, I would like to avoid such a confrontation. It would be easy enough to silence us as we are in their country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t like it,\u201d Rune said.</p><p>\u201cOf course you don\u2019t. We\u2019re leading Elise into the den of a man who could very well be a marriage prospect,\u201d Steffen said.</p><p>\u201cYou and I would die before we handed her over to that idiot,\u201d Rune declared.</p><p>\u201cAs we keep pondering, Verglas does have a legal assassin guild,\u201d Falk smiled.</p><p>\u201cI am not excited about it either, but Elise\u2019s safety is our top priority,\u201d Steffen said.</p><p>\u201cSo is everyone in agreement, then? Elise and Brida should accept Prince Toril\u2019s invitation?\u201d Erick asked.</p><p>Six reluctant males chimed in.</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she must.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it is settled. When Price Toril returns, Brida will tell him they accept his offer,\u201d Erick said.</p><p>\u201cProvided she can bring us with,\u201d Gerhart was quick to add.</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d Brida said.</p><p>\u201cIn that case, we need to start packing Elise up,\u201d Rune said, heading for her shelter.</p><p>\u201cWe must also plan out acceptable behavior,\u201d Erick said.</p><p>\u201cErick is right. Captain Meier, Elise, you cannot let anyone find out who you are. Do you understand? If King Torgen realizes he has the beloved princess of Arcainia in his clutches, there is no telling what he will do,\u201d Steffen said.</p><p>\u201cYes, brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Prince Steffen.\u201d</p><p>Brida and Elise were ready for Prince Toril when he showed up the following day.</p><p>\u201cGood morning to you, madams. I trust you slept well? Yes?\u201d he answered himself when Brida stonily stared at him and did not deign to give him a response. \u201cHave you thought about my offer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have. We will come.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI must beg you to reconsider for it is not safe\u2014wait, you will come?\u201d Prince Toril said.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Brida said.</p><p>Prince Toril clapped his hands together. \u201cThat is wonderful news indeed. I am glad you see the sense in my plan. When will you be ready to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow?\u201d Prince Toril repeated.</p><p>\u201cYes. The horses are saddled, and the birds are ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe birds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a problem understanding the words I am saying? Why must you repeat them? Yes, the birds. We could not possibly travel without her swans,\u201d Brida said, nodding at Elise.</p><p>\u201cOh. Of course,\u201d Prince Toril weakly said as he looked past Elise where her brothers were flocked together on shore, waiting to take off until Elise climbed in the saddle and started the journey.</p> <p>\u201cSo... may we depart?\u201d Brida asked after a minute of silence.</p><p>Prince Toril\u2019s smile was back. \u201cYes, of course. My horse is just past these trees,\u201d he said, heading back into the trees.</p><p>Brida mounted up her horse, and Elise took up the lead rope of Falk\u2019s horse\u2014who was laden with nettles, Elise\u2019s finished shirts, and various plants Falk had plucked the night before for medicinal purposes.</p><p>\u201cWe will travel with a few other men\u2014soldiers and hunters who accompanied me. There are only five of them, so there is no need to be afraid. Aren\u2019t you going to ride?\u201d Prince Toril said when he came back\u2014riding a splendid-looking horse.</p><p>Elise shook her head.</p><p>\u201cYou could ride behind me if your mount is otherwise burdened,\u201d Prince Toril said, glancing at Falk\u2019s horse. \u201cYou are a slight thing; my horse will hardly notice your extra weight.\u201d</p> <p>Elise shook her head again, but Prince Toril wasn\u2019t about to take no for an answer.</p><p>\u201cYou cannot walk to Ostfold. It\u2019s too far. My horse has very soothing gaits, I promise you,\u201d Prince Toril said, grabbing Elise by her forearm.</p><p>Elise looked to Brida who shrugged. \u201cHe has a point.\u201d</p><p>Elise frowned, but scrambled up behind Prince Toril.</p><p>\u201cThere, this isn\u2019t so bad, is it\u2014oof,\u201d he said when Elise lodged her arms around his stomach so tightly she squeezed air from him. \u201cNothing to fear,\u201d Prince Toril wheezed.</p><p>The prince led the way, leaving Brida to pony up Falk\u2019s horse before bringing up the rear. The Arcainian Princes hissed and bumped one another before they took off, circling overhead as Prince Toril led them through the forest.</p><p>Within several minutes, they met up with the rest of Prince Toril\u2019s party and set off for Ostfold, the capital of Verglas.</p><p>\u201cSo, where do you come from?\u201d Prince Toril asked. He spoke at a volume that made Elise think he was talking to her, but Brida answered for her.</p> <p>\u201cLoire,\u201d she lied.</p><p>Prince Toril nodded. \u201cAnd what are your names?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am Brenda. She\u2019s Elsa,\u201d Brida said.</p><p>\u201cWhat brought you to Verglas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe live in a border town. Elsa\u2019s remaining kin died, and the villagers never liked that she couldn\u2019t talk, so they ran her off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m her friend; I couldn\u2019t let her go alone.\u201d</p><p>As Brida and Prince Toril chatted, Elise studied the men traveling with them.</p><p>They had the look and air of Verglas to them\u2014meaning they were sturdy and tough like their Verglas-bred horses, but they smiled kindly, and Elise\u2019s unnatural silence did not seem to bother them.</p><p>When they reached a road, Elise looked up and, through the breaks in the trees, could spy a flock of white swans flying.</p><p>Going to Ostfold was a frightening prospect, but with Brida behind her and her foster family above her, Elise thought everything would be alright.</p><p>Ostfold was not what Elise expected.</p><p>Unlike Brandis, which was all stone, most of Ostfold was built out of wood. Each building had a slanted roof and pointed turrets, and every window had painted shutters. The buildings were beautiful and in perfect condition\u2014each house seemed to have a fresh coat of paint on it, and beautiful wood carvings could be found in every nook and cranny of even the lowliest building.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you worry about fires?\u201d Brida asked as they rode through Ostfold\u2014which was about the size of one of Arcainia\u2019s medium-sized cities.</p><p>\u201cNo. Why would we?\u201d Prince Toril blinked.</p><p>Brida and Elise exchanged glances as they rode on, heading for the royal palace.</p><p>The royal palace was smaller than Elise pictured. The Sole Ambassador mocked Castle Brandis for its size, but the Ostfold palace was only half the size of Brandis. The Verglas Royal Palace also had a significantly different style of architecture than the traditional castle. Instead of solid lines and a smooth roof, every part of the castle jutted up into triangular cut outs, like fat stalagmites of ice. There was only one tower in the castle, and it was tall and skinny and shaped like a well-sharpened pencil.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it beautiful?\u201d Prince Toril asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Elise found herself nodding. Although Ostfold and the palace weren\u2019t as beautiful to her as Castle Brandis, it did have an exotic sort of beauty, and Elise admired all the triangles and straight lines.</p><p>\u201cI thought you could take refuge at Lake Sno,\u201d Prince Toril said as he led the way to the back of the royal palace. Behind the oddly beautiful castle was a huge lake. It was a gorgeous aqua color Elise had never seen in water before.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty cold since it\u2019s snowfed from the mountains, but your swans should be able to brave it,\u201d Prince Toril said, glancing overhead where the flock flew.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a small cottage where a hermit used to live, before my father threw him out,\u201d Prince Toril said, speaking the second part quickly. \u201cIt should house you two quite comfortably. There it is.\u201d</p> <p>Elise was relieved to see that the cottage Price Toril pointed to was out of the way of the palace. Between the palace and the cottage were the royal gardens, the stables, servants\u2019 quarters, and a good-sized hill. The cottage was nestled into a group of pine trees that backed up into a large forest. It stretched up one of the mountainsides Ostfold leaned against. It was a stone\u2019s throw from a small inlet the lake stretched into, formed complements of the hill and the forest.</p><p>It would be close enough to civilization that they would be safe, but far enough away that no one would take note of seven transforming swans at sundown.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d Prince Toril asked.</p><p>Elise nodded.</p><p>\u201cIt will do. You have our thanks, Prince Toril,\u201d Brida said, regaining some of her manners due to the proximity of a palace.</p> <p>\u201cNo thanks are necessary. It is my duty as a royal prince to see to the happiness of peasants,\u201d Prince Toril said, an idiotic grin on his face.</p><p>Behind his back Brida rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI will take the ladies to their new residence. I\u2019ll see you tonight at the Rabbit and the Reindeer?\u201d Prince Toril asked his companions.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d they chorused out.</p><p>\u201cTake care, ladies,\u201d one of the more talkative soldiers said to Brida and Elise.</p><p>Elise waved in farewell as Toril directed his horse down the dirt path that led to the cottage. Brida hurried after them, clicking to her mare and Falk\u2019s mount to keep them going when they longingly eyed the beautiful stables.</p> <p>\u201cAlmost there,\u201d Brida murmured.</p><p>The cottage was unsurprisingly made of wood. It had just one carving in the exterior\u2014an extravagant snowflake posted just above the doorframe. What was most astonishing about the cottage, though, was its roof. It was covered with green grass.</p><p>Both Elise and Brida stared at the green roof.</p><p>\u201cWhat? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d Prince Toril asked after he dismounted his horse, being careful not to kick Elise in her open mouth.</p><p>Brida pointed to the cottage. \u201cThe roof. It is growing grass,\u201d she said respectfully, just in case the somewhat clueless prince hadn\u2019t noticed.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s grass,\u201d Brida repeated.</p><p>\u201cSod roofs are common practice in Verglas,\u201d Prince Toril said, helping Elise down.</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Brida asked as she too dismounted.</p><p>\u201cThey provide wonderful insulation in the winter, and they\u2019re heavy, so it supports the structure,\u201d Prince Toril said. \u201cThey\u2019re actually covered in birch bark underneath the greenery. The birch bark is what makes the roof waterproof. The grass just keeps it in place.\u201d</p><p>Brida accepted this explanation and set about unpacking the horses.</p><p>Elise, however, stared at the roof in morbid fascination.</p><p>Prince Toril caught her extreme interest and chuckled. \u201cSome folk occasionally toss their goats on their roof.\u201d</p><p>Elise swung to face him with disbelieving eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true. It keeps the goat from wandering off, and their roof gets trimmed so it does not become a bushy eyesore,\u201d Prince Toril said.</p><p>Elise was not entirely convinced Toril was telling the truth, but the loud flapping of wings told her she had no time to further enquire. She left Prince Toril and Brida and walked to the lake shore, plunging in until she was up to her knees.</p><p>Prince Toril was right\u2014the water was cold!</p><p>Elise waved to her flock of swans, who circled the inlet before they landed in the water\u2014managing to do so with a small amount of grace so they did not crash into each other or spatter the lake surface as they were prone to doing.</p><p>\u201cOnce you are settled in, I shall return. Otherwise, you can expect a kitchen girl to deliver food for you every morning and evening. If you have a need for anything, just ask her\u2014or if it is urgent, you may ask any guard around the palace,\u201d Prince Toril said.</p><p>Elise hurried out of the water when the swans began splashing each other in their exuberance to be back in water.</p><p>\u201cAgain, you have our thanks, Prince Toril,\u201d Brida said before she bowed.</p><p>Elise hastily curtsied, purposely using the plainest curtsy she could. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Prince Toril beamed, happy with Brida, Elise, and in all likeliness, himself. \u201cIt is no trouble at all. Good day to both of you, and welcome to Ostfold,\u201d he said before hefting himself back in the saddle and disappearing over the crest of the hill.</p><p>\u201cThat is one odd prince,\u201d Brida said before she pulled the horses over to a makeshift shelter. Judging by the short fence, it had been constructed for goats, but the lean-to and water trough would be good enough for horses as well-trained as Brida\u2019s and Falk\u2019s.</p><p>Elise nodded, even though Brida couldn\u2019t see her, and gathered up the saddle bag that held her three finished shirts.</p><p>\u201cThis will suit us fine, don\u2019t you think F\u00fcrst\u2014Elsa?\u201d Brida asked as she emerged from the lean-to and headed for the cottage. The captain had to lean heavily against the door to open it, and almost fell inside when the door finally gave.</p> <p>The inside of the cottage was cramped and dusty, but there was a fireplace, a crude counter, and two rickety chairs. A ladder led to a loft filled with sweet-smelling straw that would serve as a bed.</p><p>Elise heaved her knitting projects inside before she offered Brida a smile.</p><p>\u201cI agree. I like it, too,\u201d Brida said, even though Elise hadn\u2019t spoken. \u201cWe will be quite comfortable here. Your brothers made the right decision.\u201d</p><p>Elise hoped she was right, but she couldn\u2019t help but feel a nagging shard of doubt wiggling in the back of her mind. She left the cottage to watch her foster brothers splash in the lake, but her gaze was drawn to the bits of the royal palace she could see over the hill.</p><p>Although everyone appeared happy, and all of Ostfold was beautiful, Elise felt somehow the tidy exterior was used to cover a dark secret.</p> <p>Chapter 10</p><p>\u201cEverything seems well enough,\u201d Steffen said.</p><p>\u201cIt will be harder for us to find food. Snow fed bodies of water typically don\u2019t have fish in them\u2014the waters are too cold,\u201d Erick said.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps Prince Toril will realize that and give Elise food for us?\u201d Nick said.</p><p>\u201cSo we will have to choose between bugs and bird food. Funny, I never thought I would have to make that decision in my life,\u201d Gerhart said from the cottage loft.</p><p>Brida, Elise, and the seven princes were crowded inside the cottage\u2014more to keep anyone from seeing them than for shelter purposes.</p> <p>\u201cThe thing to concentrate on is that we are all here, and we all made it safely. Elise only has three and a half shirts left. We\u2019re halfway to freedom,\u201d Erick said.</p><p>\u201cYes, so everyone take this moment to give thanks to Elise,\u201d Steffen said.</p><p>\u201cThank you, sister,\u201d Nick grinned, affectionately ruffling Elise\u2019s hair.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Elise,\u201d Rune said, reaching out to touch her before Falk smacked him. \u201cOuch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we stay on our guard, we should be able to pass the remainder of our cursed days idly,\u201d Steffen said. \u201cNo questionable behavior. Everyone, act like swans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBossy brute.\u201d</p> <p>Elise couldn\u2019t help the laugh that bubbled up from her stomach, which drew grins from her brothers. They spent the remainder of the hour in high spirits and lighthearted chatter.</p><p>Elise\u2019s time at Ostfold fell into a predictable pattern. She rose with the sun and sat outside on a smooth rock and knitted until the kitchen girl arrived with oatmeal for Elise and Brida and cracked corn for the swan princes.</p><p>After breakfast, Elise went back to knitting, and Brida stole away into the woods to practice her stances and weaponry out of sight of the palace. At noon, they usually snacked on berries Brida found and bread left behind by the kitchen girl. After more hours of knitting, the kitchen girl returned with dinner\u2014usually mutton or creamed fish soup.</p><p>Soldiers on horseback rode past twice a day, patrolling a circuit around the lake.</p><p>Prince Toril visited several times a week to plead with Elise to speak to him.</p><p>\u201cI know you must be able talk. Your bear-maid speaks for both of you, and she doesn\u2019t seem the type to be extraordinarily good at reading body language,\u201d he said during the second week since their arrival at Ostfold.</p><p>Elise only smiled and shook her head as she kept knitting.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you do this? Why do you put yourself through this? It must be for a purpose,\u201d Prince Toril persisted.</p><p>Elise paused her work long enough to lay a hand on the back of her companion swan. Would it be harmful to give Prince Toril the main reason, the heart of why she worked so laboriously in spite of the pain? She didn\u2019t think so.</p><p>Elise winced when she realized she left behind a set of bloody fingerprints on the snow white feathers of her companion swan, but she turned to Prince Toril and attempted to make several different signs and motions.</p><p>\u201cFor love?\u201d Prince Toril said, surprisingly able to interpret her gestures. \u201cYou do all of this for love?\u201d</p><p>Elise nodded and went back to knitting.</p><p>Prince Toril thoughtfully stared at the swans that floated on the surface of the lake. \u201cYou must really love them,\u201d he finally said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Elise smiled, the lines of her face softening with the gesture.</p><p>Prince Toril nodded a few times. \u201cI will leave you to your knitting. I\u2019m leaving for another hunting trip in a few days, but do not fear\u2014the kitchen girl will still bring food,\u201d he said as he stood. \u201cI wish you luck with your task,\u201d he said, walking off before Elise could even try to sign or gesture anything to him.</p><p>Elise turned to her swan companion and shrugged.</p><p>One of the many things Elise was learning during this trial was that royal princes were moody creatures.</p> <p>Several days later, Elise was sitting alone and knitting with her pile of finished shirts when four soldiers marched down the hill and up to her.</p><p>\u201cKing Torgen has asked for your presence in the palace,\u201d a soft spoken soldier said, exchanging an uneasy glance with his fellow warriors.</p><p>Getting a terrible sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, Elise moved to toss her knitting in the cottage.</p><p>\u201cKing Torgen wishes that you would bring your work with you,\u201d the soldier said.</p><p>Elise gathered the shirts in her arms, her desire to keep them safe overriding the pain of the nettles scratching her arms. She glanced over her shoulder, wondering if she should whistle for Brida, but one of the soldiers gently steered her forward before she had the chance.</p> <p>The soldiers brought Elise past the servants\u2019 quarters, through the royal gardens, and into the splendid, wooden palace.</p><p>The servants and people they ran into and saw seemed nice enough, although everyone moved with quick, nervous energy.</p><p>Elise\u2019s stomach was rolling by the time they reached the dining room, where King Torgen sat near a fireplace with two wolfhounds.</p><p>\u201cSo you brought the street rat that captured Toril\u2019s attention? Good work,\u201d King Torgen said.</p><p>Unlike his easy-going son, King Torgen looked mean-spirited. He reminded Elise of an inbred dog. His features should have been handsome, but they were too strong, and his eyes were lit with a strange, feverish light.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not much to look at. What is your name, girl?\u201d the king demanded.</p> <p>\u201cMy Lord, the girl is mute. Her traveling companion calls her Elsa,\u201d the quiet soldier said.</p><p>Elise hunched her shoulders to and tried to look intimidated. It wasn\u2019t very hard\u2014King Torgen seemed to burn with deep hatred and anger.</p><p>\u201cTrying to get Toril\u2019s attention so you can be queen, hmm?\u201d he said.</p><p>Elise shook her head.</p><p>\u201cHah, like one could believe you. Toril will not be charmed by you for long. He moves from one love to the next with great indiscretion. Soon you will be another face he wooed and forgot,\u201d King Torgen said.</p><p>Elise could tell the four soldiers surrounding her were uncomfortable with the topic. Although they did not shift, the wooden shafts of the spears they held cracked as they clenched their weapons.</p><p>\u201cYou have the look of a mongrel. You aren\u2019t from Verglas, are you?\u201d King Torgen said. \u201cIs she?\u201d he said, fixing his gaze on the soldier who spoke for her earlier.</p><p>The soldier cleared his throat. \u201cI was told she comes from Loire.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLoire? That foreign filth? Pah! I cannot believe Toril has defiled Ostfold with her presence,\u201d the King Torgen said, leaning back in his chair. \u201cI\u2019m told that in addition to your traveling companion, you brought seven swans with you. Gifts for my table, perhaps?\u201d</p><p>Elise violently shook her head.</p><p>\u201cI believe they are pets, My Lord,\u201d the soldier said, taking pity on Elise.</p><p>Elise eagerly nodded.</p><p>King Torgen fell silent, which made Elise even more uncomfortable than when he spoke. He stared at her with feverish intensity, and Elise could see unreadable thoughts churning in his mind.</p><p>He reminded her of Clotilde, but more twisted. Clotilde was a bigger threat because of her dark magic, but her motivation was her selfishness and greed. King Torgen was like an abandoned well. No one knew how deep the hole went, or what monstrosities the darkness hid.</p><p>King Torgen stood and walked a slow circle around Elise, making the hair on the back of her neck prickle.</p><p>After making a full circuit, King Torgen leaned in and whispered to Elise, \u201cI don\u2019t know who you are, but I recognize the signs of a task taken up for the sake of breaking a curse.\u201d King Torgen\u2019s breath was foul. It smelled like stale wine and decayed, mushy onions.</p><p>Elise\u2019s eyes watered, but she fixed a meek look on her face as King Torgen continued. \u201cI don\u2019t have much sympathy for simpletons who are cursed. They deserve it,\u201d he hissed before he ripped the nettle shirts out of Elise\u2019s hands. \u201cWhat do we have here? This is obvious the work of black magic,\u201d King Torgen said, inspecting the four shirts.</p><p>\u201cWith all due respect, My Lord, wouldn\u2019t the Snow Queen\u2019s magic kept her out of our borders if her work is evil?\u201d the soldier asked.</p><p>King Torgen narrowed his eyes at the kind soldier. \u201cPerhaps. But one can never be too careful,\u201d he said, walking towards the fireplace. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Elise saw what he meant to do and lunged for him. The soldiers grabbed her and held her back, but they couldn\u2019t bear to look at their monarch.</p><p>When King Torgen reached the crackling fire he turned around and draped three of the shirts over his arm. He held the last shirt\u2014the unfinished one\u2014up as if to inspect it.</p><p>Elise shook her head and reached out, pleading for mercy.</p><p>King Torgen smiled\u2014a sick, twisted smile\u2014and dropped the shirt in the fire. \u201cBlack magic is not tolerated in Verglas.\u201d</p> <p>Elise opened and closed her mouth, unable to beg as her weeks of hard work burned up and turned into ash. The green nettles and endless loops turned ash gray as they caught fire and shrank, curling in the heat of the fire. Soon not a stitch of the first shirt remained. Elise hooked her eyes on the second shirt King Torgen held and struggled against the soldiers.</p><p>King Torgen dropped the second shirt in the fire. He stared at Elise, smiling in delight as he observed her despair.</p><p>The fire hissed and crackled as it consumed the second shirt, ripping apart what took Elise weeks of pain, dedication, and love to accomplish.</p><p>Elise was crying by the time King Torgen took the third shirt from where it was draped over his arm. Tears poured down her face. Please, she mouthed.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d King Torgen said before he dropped the shirt. He clapped his hands as Elise sank to her knees, her tears falling like raindrops. There was a roaring in her ears as she stared at the greedy fire that burned the third shirt.</p> <p>Her foster-brothers were doomed to remain swans. All of Elise\u2019s work was for naught.</p><p>Her ears rang, and Elise knew she was losing control of herself as the last loops of the third shirt were devoured by orange flames.</p><p>King Torgen laughed, and Elise clenched her bruised, oozing, and welt covered hands into fists. All of her pain, every moment she had spent knitting was wasted.</p><p>Elise caught the thought and shook her head. The capes were gone, yes. But Elise would never call an attempt, even a failed attempt, to free her foster brothers, to free Rune, Steffen, Falk, Erick, Nick, Mikk, and Gerhart a waste.</p><p>Elise squeezed her eye shut, cutting off her tears. When she snapped her eyes open she arranged her legs beneath her and forced herself to stand. She faced King Torgen with every ounce of training she had, standing with perfect posture and her chin raised. She looked down at King Torgen as if he were her lesser, because he was her lesser.</p><p>The soldiers were crowded around Elise, but the let go of her and were unable to keep themselves from bowing and murmuring apologies for manhandling her so.</p> <p>King Torgen met her gaze. \u201cLook at the chit pretending to be\u2014,\u201d he cut himself when Elise smirked at him. It was the barest curling of her lips, but it was enough to make King Torgen shut his mouth with an audible click.</p><p>The Verglas King glared daggers at Elise. He threw the last shirt on the fire and stalked off. \u201cWitch,\u201d he hissed as he passed Elise.</p><p>Elise lunged for the fireplace. She tried to snatch the burning shirt from the flames, but the fire was too hot and blistering.</p><p>\u201cAllow me,\u201d one of the soldiers said, putting a hand in front of Elise and scooping her aside before he used the end of his spear to fish the shirt out of the fire.</p><p>The soldier set it on the ground and stamped on the edges to put out the flames, squashing it.</p><p>Almost half of the shirt was destroyed, but once it cooled off Elise gathered it up as if it was knitted gold.</p><p>She left the palace, barefoot and her face smeared with tears, with the presence of a queen. The soldiers escorted her and her half shirt to the cottage.</p><p>\u201cMy Lady,\u201d they said, bowing deeply to her\u2014the highest compliment they could pay and the only consolation they could offer\u2014before they left.</p> <p>Elise sat on her smooth rock and arranged her skirts around her. The shirt sat on her lap like a beloved pet. Elise placed a hand on it and looked up when one of the swans left the lake water to approach her.</p><p>Unable to hold back her tears any longer, Elise shook her head when the swan tilted his head at her. She unrolled the shirt, her fingers lingering on the burned spots as hot, painful tears crawled down on her cheeks.</p><p>The swan understood, or at least understood that she was upset, and craned his neck to place his head on her shoulder.</p><p>Elise sucked in air, strangling the sob that wanted to pour out of her throat. She buried her face in the swan\u2019s soft, slick feathers and threw her arms around its body.</p><p>They were still like that an hour later when Brida found them.</p><p>\u201cF\u00fcrstin? What happened\u2014oh,\u201d Brida said, catching sight of the mangled shirt. \u201cOh, F\u00fcrstin,\u201d Brida said, her voice echoing Elise\u2019s silent heartbreak.</p><p>The captain placed a hand on Elise\u2019s shoulder, but when Elise didn\u2019t remove herself from her bird consoler, the captain disappeared.</p><p>By sunset, Elise had some control over herself. She hadn\u2019t cried in several hours, but her resolve crumbled as she watched her foster brothers splash their way out of the lake. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cElise? What is wrong? What happened?\u201d Rune asked, the first to climb free of the cold water.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re gone, Rune.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are gone?\u201d Erick said, just behind his younger brother.</p><p>\u201cThe shirts. They\u2019re gone. King Torgen burned all of them,\u201d Elise said, nudging the rescued shirt to show the burned nettles.</p> <p>\u201cElise, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Rune said, wrapping his arms around her.</p><p>Elise cried into his chest, letting the sobs she had held back all afternoon go.</p><p>Rune scooped her up and rocked her like a child as she vented her heartbreak, anger, and misery.</p><p>When Elise was done crying, her eyes were so puffy she could barely see. Rune carried her into cottage, and one of her foster-brothers brought the shirt with and hung it over a chair.</p><p>Gerhart sat in the loft, his legs dangling over the side. Steffen and Erick stood together in one corner of the small cottage. Mikk and Nick were in the other, and Falk stalked back and forth in the open space like a snarling bear.</p> <p>Everyone looked up when Brida entered the cottage, carrying a small sack. \u201cSo you know?\u201d she asked, observing their grim looks.</p><p>\u201cMore or less,\u201d Steffen said.</p><p>\u201cFrom what we can tell, King Torgen spoke to Elise and burned the shirts. We\u2019re guessing she managed to fish that one out of the fire based on the singed patches,\u201d Erick said, pointing to the remaining cape.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s roughly how it happened,\u201d Elise said, her voice rough like gravel as she slipped from Rune\u2019s grasp and sat in a free chair.</p><p>Steffen crouched down in front of her and put his hands on his knees. \u201cWe only have a few minutes left before we change back, but we need to make something clear. Elise, you don\u2019t need to do this again. In fact, you shouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s enough that you tried. We will wait for Angelique. We don\u2019t want to cause you more pain over this. Do you understand?\u201d Steffen asked.</p><p>Elise nodded.</p> <p>\u201cThank you for trying, sister. Your devotion warms my heart, but now it is our turn to take care of you,\u201d Steffen said, hugging Elise.</p><p>Nick paced. \u201cMaybe we should leave this place. I thought King Torgen was mad. I didn\u2019t think he was evil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs bad as Clotilde,\u201d Mikk said.</p><p>\u201cSince Elise won\u2019t need time to knit, we could travel during the day,\u201d Gerhart said.</p><p>\u201cAs swans? It\u2019s dangerous here, but it\u2019s more dangerous in the wild,\u201d Rune said.</p><p>\u201cAnd we can\u2019t leave Verglas. Angelique told us to stay here,\u201d Steffen added, his voice tired and weary.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d Erick said.</p><p>Steffen nodded and led the way out of the cottage. Mikk and Gerhart were hot on his heels.</p> <p>Erick paused to place a hand on Elise\u2019s head. \u201cBe well, and please talk during the day,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I agree with Erick,\u201d Nick said, affectionately ruffling Elise\u2019s hair.</p><p>\u201cAs you should. I am the chancellor of a college,\u201d Erick said.</p><p>\u201cHoo, someone\u2019s got an attitude considering he spends his day eating minnows and cracked corn,\u201d Nick said as they left the cottage.</p><p>Rune slid his fingertips under Elise\u2019s chin. \u201cRest well,\u201d he said. \u201cI am sorry for your heartbreak,\u201d he added, kissing the top of her head.</p><p>Elise would have blushed if her face wasn\u2019t so swollen from all the crying. She looked around. Falk and Brida were the only ones in the cottage. Falk was staring at Elise\u2019s feet, mashing his lips together. \u201cFalk?\u201d Elise cautiously asked.</p><p>Falk threw his arms around Elise. It wasn\u2019t the secure, familiar hug Rune gave her. In fact, it was quite awkward and a little uncomfortable, but as he held her to his chest, Elise could hear the quick thud of Falk\u2019s heartbeat and the unsteady heave of his lungs.</p><p>Elise smiled, touched that Falk was so upset on her behalf.</p><p>He let her go as abruptly as he embraced her before he hurried out of the cottage, without speaking.</p><p>Elise joined Brida at the door and watched the princes grumble as they waded into the cold water.</p><p>\u201cAre those knitting needles?\u201d Elise asked Brida.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Brida said, turning the sack around in her hands.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Elise said, holding out a hand.</p><p>\u201cYou still intend to make the shirts? Even after your brothers said not to?\u201d Brida asked, passing the small bag to Elise.</p><p>Elise snorted as her hand closed around the bag. \u201cMy brothers are not always right. Besides, do I seem like a quitter to you?\u201d she said before she went back into the cottage.</p><p>Brida had a small smile on her lips. \u201cNo, you do not, F\u00fcrstin.\u201d</p><p>When Elise\u2019s swan companion realized the following day that Elise was knitting, he complained all day long. There was hardly a moment when he was not peering over her shoulder, grunting in displeasure or climbing into her lap and getting in the way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When all of her foster-brothers transformed that evening, they tried to talk her out of it. They begged Elise to give up, pleaded with her, and Mikk even threatened her that when they returned to Arcainia, she would never be without a full security detail.</p><p>Elise ignored it all. After a week, the brothers gave up trying to convince the hard-headed princess that she didn\u2019t need to break their curse, and instead spent most of their time assigning blame.</p><p>\u201cThis is Steffen\u2019s fault. She learned how to be a stubborn mule from him,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>\u201cI blame that wretched Prince Toril. Elise can\u2019t leave this place as long as we\u2019re swans, but if she breaks the curse, we are home free. I know I wouldn\u2019t want to spend one day longer with him than I would have to,\u201d Gerhart said.</p> <p>\u201cI am more inclined to say we share the blame equally. She will not give up not because of her temperament, but because of her affection for us,\u201d Erick said. A mischievous glint lit up his eyes. \u201cThat is not to say that perhaps she loves some of us differently. Falk, Rune, do either of you care to take the lion\u2019s share of blame?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will find out,\u201d Mikk promised.</p><p>Nick clapped. \u201cWith Mikk on the case, we\u2019ll soon learn who our darling sister favors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already told you I don\u2019t favor anyone,\u201d Elise said, setting aside the first few loops of her new shirt. (She spent all week repairing the badly burned shirt, and judging by the fact that it was green and holding together, Elise was confident it worked.) \u201cWhere is Steffen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOutside,\u201d Rune said, glancing out the window. \u201cPerhaps it is your fault, Erick. You always press her about duties.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, but I was also the one who taught her about the uselessness in doing a task that is too taxing for the payoff,\u201d Erick said.</p><p>Elise nodded to Brida\u2014who was chopping roots with Falk on the rickety table\u2014before she slipped out of the cottage.</p><p>Steffen was standing in the lake, up to his knees in water. Elise could only see his back, but his head was tilted up to stare at the moon.</p><p>Elise joined him, wincing when she stepped into the cold water. When she stood next to Steffen, she smothered a surprised gasp.</p><p>Steffen had a hand over his heart. His fingers were clenched, digging into the fabric of his shirt and his skin like claws. The wind ruffled his hair and made him look picturesque, but his blue eyes were soft with heartbreak, like an injured animal or a dying man.</p><p>Never before had Elise seen Steffen wear an expression of such pain\u2014and she had seen him wounded and bleeding everywhere after a skirmish with a goblin.</p> <p>Elise ducked back to give him privacy, but Steffen spoke. \u201cI miss her, Elise,\u201d he said before he took a shuddering breath. \u201cI miss her so badly it hurts. My heart, my whole being aches. I never thought I would be one of those whipped men who whimper whenever they\u2019re separated from their loved one,\u201d he said after a bark of laughter.</p><p>\u201cYou love her, Steffen. There is no shame in that,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>Steffen nodded. \u201cIn my pain, I have become nothing but a hopeless romantic. I want to see her so badly that I stare at the moon, hoping she will glance at it, and for a moment we will look at the same thing.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, and tears slipped down his cheeks. \u201cI feel so wretched. I cannot even count on the curse to take my memories. As a swan, I feel like I am missing a part of myself, and lately I have begun to remember her as I float on the lake. I cannot even remember that I am cursed when I am a swan, but her I recall,\u201d Steffen cut himself off and dug his fingers deeper into his chest.</p><p>Elise placed a hand on her brother\u2019s back. \u201cYou will see her again, Steffen. And I\u2019m sure in the meantime she is doing her best to help our subjects in your place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about our subjects. I care about her,\u201d Steffen said. \u201cGabrielle,\u201d the crown prince breathed as he stared up at the moon.</p><p>Gabrielle glanced at the moon as she slid a second dagger up her right sleeve. \u201cAlmost ready,\u201d she said as she tied her hair back with a leather cord.</p><p>The cat watched her, his eyes glowing in the dim light. \u201cIt is remarkable to me how easily you cast aside grandeur and silken clothes and return to looking and acting like a street urchin,\u201d he complained. \u201cIt only goes to show that a pig dressed as a princess is still a pig.\u201d</p> <p>Gabrielle grinned and grabbed a paintbrush and a capped inkwell. \u201cDisappointed?\u201d</p><p>The cat shoved his pink nose in the air and made a \u201cHumph,\u201d noise before he leaped off the windowsill and padded across the room. At the last moment, he turned around and said, \u201cOf course not. You wouldn\u2019t be half as fun if you were a stuffed doll like that. Come on. The Queen won\u2019t be out of her chambers for long.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle grabbed the sword\u2014Steffen\u2019s smallest sword\u2014and tied it to her belt. She rubbed the pommel as pain stabbed her heart. \u201cSteffen would laugh himself silly if he knew how badly I missed him, and then he would lecture me about duty and sacrifice, and how the country comes before me, blah, blah, blah,\u201d she said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStop mooning over your bumpkin-headed prince and get moving,\u201d the cat called from the hallway.</p><p>Gabrielle looked up at the moon again. For a moment the heartbreak she was holding back threatened to overtake her. Gabrielle grimly shook her head and pushed the feeling back before she placed a hand on her hip and smirked at the moon. \u201cI\u2019m taking such fabulous care of Arcainia. You will have nothing to complain and bemoan when you get back. Just you wait,\u201d she promised before she was out of the room and moving down the hallway.</p><p>The cat was just ahead of her, peering around a corner. \u201cThe hallway appears to be empty,\u201d he said, leaping onto Gabrielle\u2019s shoulder when she hunched over for him to do so. \u201cI will cast invisibility on us, even though it isn\u2019t necessary,\u201d he said as Gabrielle felt the gelatinous sensation of invisibility cover her from head to toe. \u201cIf you paraded in front of a squad of soldiers with a four-piece band they would still tell Queen Clothead, with eyes as innocent as babes, that they haven\u2019t seen the Crown Princess in months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not something to complain about,\u201d Gabrielle said as she padded down the hallway. \u201cBesides, the invisibility allows them to stay truthful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs you wish, Mistress,\u201d the cat said, crouching low on Gabrielle\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>Gabrielle grinned at him before she pushed open the unguarded doors to Queen Clotilde\u2019s private quarters.</p><p>The cat jumped from Gabrielle\u2019s shoulders, breaking the invisibility spell. \u201cPrince Mikkael\u2019s sneaks haven\u2019t reported anything of interest besides the besotted squad of soldiers, correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Gabrielle said as she snagged the Queen\u2019s newest jewelry purchases and tucked them in a belt pouch. \u201cNo wonder the Treasury Department said the daily vault is draining\u2014she\u2019s spending a fortune on herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be worse if F\u00fcrstin Elise did not have the key to the treasury. Such a smart girl,\u201d the cat said in a rare bit of praise as he rolled on the queen\u2019s pillows.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Gabrielle asked.</p><p>\u201cThe queen is allergic to cats,\u201d the cat said.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019m being petty. It happens. Carry on! You will hawk the jewels to cover the deficit in the military budget?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Has she left any nasty bits of her magic out?\u201d Gabrielle asked.</p><p>\u201cNot quite. She\u2019s grown at least a little smarter and locked them up in this armoire. Although I must say it\u2019s about time. We\u2019ve been destroying her charms and potions since the princes were turned into swans in spring,\u201d the cat scoffed.</p> <p>Gabrielle joined him, standing in front of the armoire. \u201cSo, we can\u2019t foil her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that. I merely said she\u2019s locked them up,\u201d the cat said before he set about cleaning his face with a white paw. The armoire clicked, and Gabrielle was able to swing the doors open. \u201cAn amateur\u2019s work,\u201d the cat scoffed before leaping into the armoire.</p><p>Gabrielle smiled at the feline before she continued searching the room for jewelry and other valuables.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s getting stronger, you know,\u201d the cat said, his voice muffled inside the armoire. \u201cThe dark artifacts she keeps on her grow more powerful, feeding off her hate and greed.\u201d</p><p>There was a crack of glass and a flash of light inside the armoire.</p><p>The cat cursed.</p><p>\u201cPuss?\u201d Gabrielle called.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine; a charm was stronger than I thought it would be.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you need help?\u201d Gabrielle asked.</p><p>\u201cNO. I have told you before these petty things are nothing to a cat as magical and wonderful as I, but I do not want you anywhere near them,\u201d the cat said, poking his black and white head out of the armoire to fix Gabrielle with a warning look before he disappeared back inside.</p><p>\u201cHer charms and potions are getting stronger, as well. Not because of any increased skill but because of the dark artifacts. The longer she goes unchallenged, the more dangerous she will be,\u201d the cat said.</p><p>\u201cAngelique will help as soon as she can,\u201d Gabrielle said, pocketing a gold bracelet.</p><p>\u201cThat may not be soon enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can we do? The princes are still cursed; King Henrik won\u2019t be waking from the stupor Clotilde has him in, and you and I make a fine pair of resistance fighters, but we cannot take her on ourselves,\u201d Gabrielle said. \u201cWe don\u2019t even know what the artifacts are.\u201d</p><p>The cat leapt from the armoire. \u201cAll finished. That should set her back another month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPuss...what are we to do?\u201d Gabrielle said.</p><p>The handsome cat trotted across the room and jumped on to Gabrielle\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWe do our best and wait for your bumpkin-head to return. Have faith, Gabi. I did not make you the Marquise of Carabas and snag you a prince for you to die young and beautiful at the hands of an incompetent hag,\u201d the cat said before he rubbed his head against Gabrielle\u2019s and purred.</p><p>The sound soothed Gabrielle, and some of the tension left her. \u201cYou are right.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI am always right. Now we had better make our exit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Gabrielle said, popping the stopper off the inkwell she carried before dipping her brush in it.</p><p>\u201cAgain? And you were surprised that I was being petty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it. It\u2019s the only spot of fun I get. Besides, don\u2019t you see how thick the paint is caked on? It obviously irritates her,\u201d Gabrielle smiled as she stood before a huge portrait of Queen Clotilde.</p> <p>\u201cCarry on, then. I am all for irritating the hag. But if you spill a drop of ink on my fur, I shall be forced to claw your hide.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle laughed and reached up to make the first brushstroke. \u201cHave faith in my skills, Puss.\u201d</p><p>An hour later, Queen Clotilde returned to her room. She glanced at her portrait and shrieked. \u201cNOOOOOO!\u201d</p><p>Two guards reluctantly entered her chambers. \u201cWhat is wrong, Queen?\u201d</p><p>Queen Clotilde raised a hand and pointed to her ruined portrait. \u201cThat brat!\u201d she shouted. \u201cEveryone tells me Princess Gabrielle is gone, but she\u2019s struck again, and she\u2019s ruined my portrait!\u201d</p> <p>The painting of Queen Clotilde was defaced. The queen\u2019s painted face was once serene and beautiful. Now it sported a mustache, ear hair, and several warts, all drawn on with black writing ink.</p><p>The soldiers maintained blank expressions. \u201cHow unfortunate,\u201d they parroted.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not unfortunate\u2014it\u2019s a crime! I want her head on a platter. Muster the guards and call for the royal painter this instant!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Queen.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>Summer passed, and Elise worked steadily. Her hands hurt worse than ever, but she knitted with renewed determination. By the last month of summer, she had four finished shirts, and worked on the fifth with great vigor.</p> <p>Life remained the same. Prince Toril visited often. Elise\u2019s brothers did their best to spend their hour as humans to entertain her and relieve her pain. The days were, to be honest, boring and painful but not without little bits of joy.</p><p>Elise\u2019s swan companion was a constant. And when Elise was about halfway through with her fifth shirt, her curiosity grew to unbearable limits.</p><p>Previously, Elise avoided wondering which prince her swan companion was. \u201cThey\u2019re not my foster-brothers when they get their feathers and beak. They\u2019re swans. They can\u2019t possibly remember, much less realize, what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Elise explained one summer night during her hour of reprieve to Brida when the girls were washing together for a shared supper. \u201cI know you think it is Falk, but I disagree. It could be any of my foster-brothers. Whatever prince it is probably doesn\u2019t realize what he\u2019s doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Brida said, unconvinced.</p><p>Elise stood by her words...until her conviction lessened.</p><p>Her swan companion acted too human.</p><p>If Elise happened to drop a small item, like her whistle or one of her knitting needles, the swan clamped his beak around it and carried it for her. The swan ate whenever Elise ate rather than grazing all day long like his brothers, and he was watchful. Whenever a patrolling soldier passed, or even if Brida emerged from the woods for lunch, Elise\u2019s companion swan watched.</p><p>What tickled Elise\u2019s curiosity was that whenever Prince Toril visited, the swan pinched, smacked, and burrowed his way into sitting between Elise and the prince.</p> <p>Elise tried to nonchalantly watch her companion swan when he hurried back to the lake to transform, but the wily bird always made sure to dart in between a few of his brothers, and Elise lost sight of him every time. Once Elise wove a crown of flowers and linked it around the base of the swan\u2019s neck, but he ripped it off by the time sunset came.</p><p>Her curiosity aroused, Elise was not going to give in easily.</p><p>This called for drastic measures.</p><p>\u201cSunset is almost upon us. I\u2019m going to stoke the fire,\u201d Brida said.</p><p>Elise nodded but kept her eyes glued to her swan companion, who was snacking on grass.</p><p>\u201c...Princess?\u201d</p><p>Elise gave Brida a thumbs up and pulled her legs to her chest so she could rest her chin on her knees.</p><p>Brida hesitated before she leaned over and whispered, \u201cAre you finally determined enough to confirm his identity?\u201d</p><p>Elise nodded.</p><p>Brida smiled. \u201cGood luck, F\u00fcrstin,\u201d she said before she climbed the slope to the cottage and disappeared inside.</p><p>As the last rays of the sun disappeared over the horizon, Elise\u2019s swan companion stood.</p><p>Elise threw herself to her feet and scrambled after him.</p><p>When the swan reached the water, he tried to paddle away, but Elise braved the cool waters and plunged in after him, grabbing his tail feathers before he could scoot away.</p><p>She chased the swan until she was up to her chest in the water. The swan slipped from her grip then and started to paddle away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Elise sighed, her shoulders drooping. The swan paused and paddled back to her side. It tipped its head back and forth, studying her face. Whatever he was looking for, he must have seen, for he settled in next to Elise as the sun disappeared on the horizon.</p><p>Seeing the transformation up close was a new experience for Elise.</p><p>As usual, the water grew choppy, and the swan princes extended their wings into the air before they were surrounded by a white light.</p><p>The white light had a musical quality to it. It sounded like magic, Elise supposed. It was laughter and raindrops on a lake. It had the chime of an ice crystal clinked on a frosty day and the deep toll of a cathedral bell. It was the wind singing on a mountainside, smiles, sunshine, and stardust.</p> <p>Elise held her hand out to see if she could catch a bit of the light\u2014it fell from the transforming princes like fire shedding sparks and embers\u2014but when the light touched her skin, it bounced off and disappeared, fading like a dying flame.</p><p>Disappointed, but still curious, Elise looked up just as the white feathers were shed and the Arcainian princes dropped in the water, fully transformed.</p><p>Brida was right.</p><p>\u201cFalk,\u201d Elise said, her voice revealing her disbelief. In the weeks before Brida had all but said it was him, but Elise doubted a man who could spit out nicknames like \u201cDewdrop\u201d as if they were poison could be sensitive enough to follow Elise like a faithful companion. It showed just how little she understood him.</p><p>Falk, looking chagrined, brought his hand out of the cold lake water to push his goldenrod hair out of his face. \u201cSo sorry to disappoint.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHah-hah, told you she would be,\u201d Nick said as he climbed out of the lake, his twin right behind him.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not, I\u2019m not,\u201d Elise said, first to Nick and then to Falk. \u201cI\u2019m just...surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why would you be surprised?\u201d Falk asked, his eyebrows furrowed as he stared Elise down.</p><p>He was waiting for Elise to say because she didn\u2019t believe he loved her. Elise could read his frustration and hurt in his dark eyes.</p><p>Elise had underestimated him, and in a way she belittled his feelings, just as Brida predicted. She had yet to acknowledge either he or Rune, and she still acted as if she suspected he secretly hated her.</p><p>It was unfair of her. Since Falk became a swan, he was nothing but helpful. Falk acted in her best interest through the entire trial. He was the one who organized the brothers the first night at the new pond. He found food for Elise and Brida, and he went out of his way to find plants and make salves to lessen Elise\u2019s pain.</p> <p>And all Elise did in return was eye him and thoughtlessly declare she didn\u2019t believe in his feelings.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Elise said, surprising them both.</p><p>Falk shifted in the water. \u201cFor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor being unworthy of your feelings for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you are,\u201d Falk said, his expression earnest.</p><p>Elise chuckled, which turned into a shiver from the cold water they were still standing in. \u201cWhy, Falk?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know I am not Rune,\u201d Falk started.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m asking,\u201d Elise cut him off. \u201cWhy do you love me? What is it about me that would make you tolerate your older brothers\u2019 teasing and intimidate your little brother?\u201d Elise asked, drawing closer until she was less than an arm\u2019s length from him.</p><p>Falk was very still, as if he feared he would startle Elise and make her run away. \u201cBecause you are fearless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean...you arm yourself with whatever is necessary to overcome your enemy, whether it be knitting needles or a horse bridle. And I love the way claw at others for money,\u201d Falk said.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>Falk continued, \u201cWhen you were first posted to the Treasury Department, you listened to me give an hour-long lecture about grain production in a department meeting. You were the only person who never yawned and who never looked away. You listened with absolute attention and when I was finished, you asked questions.\u201d</p><p>Elise was not terribly impressed or moved. Falk must have picked up on her mood because he pulled at his goldenrod colored hair.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand what I\u2019m trying to say. You have a big heart, and you would never stop loving us. You are more elegant and lovely than every lady in Arcainia. I love your intelligence, and I love you. And... I love that you are warm and affectionate,\u201d he finished, a note of longing in his voice.</p><p>\u201cThe nicknames?\u201d Elise said, her voice cracking.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ridiculous names you call me: Fawn, Snowflake, Honey Cake,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cYes, what of them?\u201d Falk said.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean what of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was under the impression those are terms of endearment,\u201d Falk said. \u201cFather said they were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cThen I don\u2019t understand your confusion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe way you said them...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Falk said.</p><p>Elise hesitated, \u201c...You really meant them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Falk said, his sincerity shining in his eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Elise bit her lower lip.</p><p>She had been wrong about Falk. She thought he couldn\u2019t possibly love her, not the real her. It had to be the \u201cperfect princess\u201d she pretended to be that he loved. But now, even Elise couldn\u2019t pretend Falk didn\u2019t see the real her.</p><p>Perhaps what was more thought provoking, was the way Elise had treated Falk in the previous months and years. Yes, he tended to sneer words, but even Rune said Falk accidentally insulted Elise whenever he meant to compliment her. How much had Falk said, and how much had Elise ignored?</p><p>\u201cElise?\u201d Falk reached out to touch a loose coil of hair that had fallen from the ponytail Elise pulled her hair back in. \u201cAll I\u2019m asking for is the chance for you to love me.\u201d</p> <p>Elise licked her lips and almost bit her tongue when her teeth started chattering. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Falk froze. \u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Elise said, making the water gush when she lunged forward to hug him.</p><p>Falk took a shuddering breath and eased his arms around her. Elise could feel his heart pounding a mile a minute under her cheek as she linked her arms around his neck.</p><p>Falk leaned his head against hers. \u201cThank you,\u201d he whispered.</p> <p>On shore, rocks cracked as Nick and Mikk held Rune back. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotten your moment with her, Rune-y,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>\u201cSeveral moments,\u201d Mikk said.</p><p>\u201cNow be a fair sportsmen, and let Falk have his,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>Elise shivered in Falk\u2019s arms and squealed in surprise when Falk hunched over and slipped an arm under her knees. \u201cThis water is freezing. We should get to shore,\u201d he said, carrying her out of lake.</p><p>Elise clung to Falk\u2019s neck as water cascaded from them. \u201cYou could put me down,\u201d she said when the water was up to Falk\u2019s shins.</p><p>\u201cNot a chance,\u201d Falk said, leaving the water and starting up the path to the cottage. He passed Nick, Mikk, and a glowering Rune.</p> <p>Erick waited at the cottage door. \u201cOh,\u201d he said, pushing his eyebrows up. \u201cIs the dark horse taking the lead now?\u201d he asked, speaking more to Nick and Mikk than to Falk or Elise.</p><p>\u201cHard to tell,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>Mikk held his thumb and pointer figure an inch apart. \u201cJust a bit.\u201d</p><p>Erick laughed heartily, and Falk edged past them to carry Elise into the cottage.</p><p>Brida was waiting with towels, which she wrapped around Elise the instant Falk set her down.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you thinking, keeping her in the icy water?\u201d Steffen scolded Falk before he threw a towel at him, hitting the younger prince in the face.</p><p>\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t particularly want her to marry Rune?\u201d Falk asked after removing the towel from his face.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t, but I don\u2019t particularly want her to marry you either,\u201d Steffen said \u201cWho, then, is she supposed to marry?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo one. Elise is too cute to marry a brute. She can stay unmarried for life,\u201d Steffen said, patting the top of Elise\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cSteffen, I\u2019m not a dog,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cFine, but you cannot court anyone until you are at least 40, or married,\u201d Steffen said.</p><p>\u201cHow is that supposed to work?\u201d Falk asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not. That\u2019s the beauty of it,\u201d Steffen said.</p><p>Rune broke his way inside, sending Mikk and Nick toppling over like wooden dolls. \u201cAre you warm enough, Elise? Should I go find some more firewood?\u201d</p><p>Falk glanced outside. \u201cI have enough light to search for some dandelions. I should make a paste for your hands again,\u201d he said once he finished drying off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come with you. We can talk while I gather firewood,\u201d Rune said, eyeing his brother.</p><p>\u201cYour suitors are very useful, F\u00fcrstin,\u201d Brida said as the princes elbowed their way out of the doors.</p><p>\u201cThank you, I think,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cRight, they\u2019re gone. I can finally update the gambling pool. Mikk, you were the one who thought Falk would get through to Elise, yes? Steffen, you owe Mikk a gold coin,\u201d Erick said, sliding a scroll of paper out of its hiding spot under a stool.</p><p>\u201cBother,\u201d Steffen tisked.</p><p>Mikk smiled.</p><p>\u201cGerhart, I\u2019m sorry but you\u2019re completely out of the running,\u201d Erick said, using a quill to cross something off on the scroll.</p><p>\u201cEnjoy your life of wretched singlehood,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>\u201cI never wanted to be in the running anyway,\u201d Gerhart shuddered.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Mikk said. \u201cOnella.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you stop talking about her?\u201d Gerhart shrieked.</p><p>\u201cI forgot about her,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>\u201cWe have a separate gambling pool that Onella will or will not answer Gerhart\u2019s feelings. Would you care to make a wager?\u201d Erick asked.</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019ll put down three gold coins that she laughs and guts him to make a belt for herself when he confesses. Only strong, half-mad people work directly under Falk,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>\u201cShe would not do such a savage thing,\u201d Gerhart said.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you put your money where your mouth is and bet on yourself in that case?\u201d Steffen asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Brida\u2019s forehead wrinkled. \u201cNot being officially adopted might be a lucky break, F\u00fcrstin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree.

If you were adopted, neither Prince Rune nor Prince Falk could marry you,\u201d Brida said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>Gerhart blinked. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know that was why Father and Mother didn\u2019t adopt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I know that!?\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cBrida,\u201d Nick said, \u201cYou just ruined a portion of our fun. We were waiting for Mr. Hero or Gloomy Agriculture boy to point that out.\u201d</p><p>Elise tried to take deep calming breaths. \u201cI love them all, that is why I work to free them. I love them all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you sound like you\u2019re trying to convince yourself? Have you already made up your mind on which brother you want?

It would take great resilience to claim a true relationship to all of you,\u201d Brida said.</p><p>\u201cTruth,\u201d Mikk grunted.</p><p>\u201cElsa, Elsa, I brought you a real treat,\u201d Prince Toril hollered as he trotted down the hill and made his way to the cottage.</p><p>Elise sat outside with the sixth shirt, which was almost finished. Swan Falk was at her side, and he made a disparaging hiss when Prince Toril strolled up.</p> <p>\u201cHello to you, too, foul-tempered bird,\u201d Prince Toril said, plopping down next to Elise. He removed a folded handkerchief from his tunic and peeled back the cloth. \u201cTa-da,\u201d he said, revealing several cookies. \u201cGo on, try one,\u201d Prince Toril urged.</p><p>Elise hesitantly took a cookie and bit into it. It was sweet, but there was an odd flavoring Elise never had before. She looked inquisitively at Prince Toril.</p><p>The young man did not disappoint. \u201cIt\u2019s a cardamom cookie. Have you had one before? No? Well, you may have them all\u2014although I suppose you will insist on sharing with your bear-maid, won\u2019t you?\u201d Prince Toril said.</p><p>Elise took the handkerchief and bowed her head at him. She brushed crumbs from her lips before smiling.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Prince Toril said, surprisingly accurate at interpreting Elise\u2019s gestures and behaviors. He glanced at the nettle shirt as Elise set the treat aside to pick up her knitting needles again. \u201cYou\u2019re still working on those?\u201d</p><p>Elise nodded.</p><p>\u201cHow very loyal,\u201d Prince Toril said, his voice lacking conviction and feeling.</p><p>Elise raised her eyebrows, but the prince looked away and didn\u2019t acknowledge the hollow sound of his words.</p> <p>Prince Toril rubbed his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to say this delicately, so I\u2019m just going to say it. I leave tomorrow for a two-week trip. And no, it\u2019s not hunting.\u201d</p><p>Elise thoughtfully nodded and stared at Prince Toril until his ears turned red.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fishing, but now is the right season, and I want to go! If you\u2019re afraid Father will do something to you while I\u2019m gone, you could come with me. I mean, it would be highly improper, but gossip doesn\u2019t seem to bother you anyway,\u201d Prince Toril said.</p><p>Elise set her knitting aside. Prince Toril\u2019s absence was a grave thing. She couldn\u2019t go with him\u2014it wouldn\u2019t be practical to try and lug seven swans and all her knitting across Verglas\u2014but the idea of staying in the cottage left her uneasy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I want to go,\u201d Prince Toril said, his voice colored with guilt.</p><p>Elise studied Prince Toril. She didn\u2019t despise him for his selfishness. It merely showed how immature he was. He did his best by her, and Elise suspected it was very difficult to be raised by King Torgen.</p><p>Elise patted Prince Toril\u2019s knee in sympathy.</p><p>Prince Toril looked at her with wide eyes. \u201cOuch,\u201d he said when Falk nipped him.</p><p>Elise placed a hand on Falk\u2019s soft, feathery back before she resumed knitting.</p><p>\u201cIs there a reason why you love these wretched birds so much?\u201d Prince Toril complained. \u201cBecause I have to say they\u2019re a downright nuisance.\u201d</p><p>Elise looked up from her knitting, and the prince hurried to retract his statement. \u201cI mean, they seem like marvelous pets for you. They match your grace and, um, beauty. Ouch! Would you stop that?\u201d Prince Toril said when Falk bit him again.</p><p>Elise soundlessly laughed, which made Prince Toril pull a lopsided grin. \u201cOW!\u201d he said when Falk got him again. \u201cBlasted bird!\u201d</p><p>Falk fluffed his feathers and looked beautiful.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure they\u2019re really swans? They seem too bloodthirsty\u2014agh!\u201d Prince Toril said when Falk flapped his white wings and smacked the Verglas Prince in the face.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it. I\u2019m not bringing you any corn today,\u201d Prince Toril declared, holding his nose as Falk settled down behind Elise. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Grinning, Elise held out the handkerchief of cookies.</p><p>\u201cA sweet to pacify my pain?\u201d Prince Toril said, sounding especially wretched. \u201cWhy not?\u201d he grinned before he took one and bit into it. \u201cSo, do you enjoy the lake view?\u201d</p><p>While Prince Toril was gone, Elise kept to the woods during the day. She stayed out of sight and never strayed far from Brida. They returned to the cottage only after dark. It was easy enough to keep knitting\u2014she finished the sixth shirt and moved onto to the seventh\u2014but it made Elise uneasy to leave her brothers behind on the lake.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be fine, F\u00fcrstin. They can fly off at the first sign of danger,\u201d Brida said.</p> <p>Elise supposed this was true, but she was still apprehensive.</p><p>The days trickled by, and hints of fall started to color the world. The few trees in Verglas that were not pine trees or evergreens started to drop their leaves; the air was cooler, and the ground was frosted over every morning like a fresh cake.</p><p>Elise worked harder than ever on the shirt, the last shirt. She worked on it night and day, crouching by the fire in the cottage, and sometimes knitting only by the touch.</p><p>The two weeks were almost up when one afternoon Elise heard the distinctive thrum of swan wings beating the air.</p><p>Elise poked her head up like a surfacing groundhog.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019re fine, F\u00fcrstin,\u201d Brida said. She was crouched over her sword, cleaning the blade.</p><p>When the flapping continued, Elise lumbered to her feet\u2014clutching the last shirt. She set off through the woods, heading for the lake.</p><p>\u201cF\u00fcrstin,\u201d Brida called before chasing after her.</p><p>When they drew close to the edge of the woods, Brida yanked Elise back and dragged her behind a pine tree. They pushed back fragrant needles to spy on six guards.</p><p>The guards were herding the seven swan princes of Arcainia out of the water and up the hill\u2014heading for the castle.</p><p>The swans beat their wings and hissed, lunging at the soldiers. To their credit, the soldiers handled the princes as gently as they could, prodding them along with the wooden poles of their spears.</p> <p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t they fly away?\u201d Brida breathed.</p><p>Elise\u2019s heart twisted in her chest. The swan princes did not fly because even while cursed, they were noble enough to think they couldn\u2019t leave her behind.</p><p>Elise pulled her arm out of Brida\u2019s grasp and moved to plunge through the trees.</p><p>\u201cPrincess Elise,\u201d Brida said, grabbing Elise by the wrist. \u201cYou cannot go.\u201d</p><p>Elise held the seventh nettle shirt out to Brida.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about the shirts, this is about your safety. Your brothers gave me explicit orders to see to your protection above all else. I cannot let you go down there.\u201d</p><p>You must, Elise gestured.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know what King Torgen will do. He might not be satisfied with ruining your work. It might be you he destroys next,\u201d Brida said.</p> <p>Elise shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you do this?\u201d Brida said, her voice breaking.</p><p>Because I love them.</p><p>Elise pulled her wrist from Brida\u2019s limp grasp and marched down the hill. When she reached the cottage she put her whistle to her lips and blew it.</p><p>The six soldiers turned around at the noise. (One of them winced when a swan prince pecked him on the thigh.) \u201cElsa, King Torgen asks that you would see him,\u201d one of the soldiers said. \u201cHe instructed us to bring your knitting and your birds, but if you come willingly with us, we will leave the swans behind.\u201d</p><p>Behind her, Elise heard the noise of Brida unsheathing her sword from her hiding spot in the trees. Elise shook her head at Brida and walked down the path to the soldiers.</p><p>Two of the soldiers started shooing the swans back to the water, but five of the swans wouldn\u2019t budge. Instead, they hurried forward, hissing and beating their wings. The soldiers blocked their way with their spears, holding the birds back.</p><p>One of the soldiers had already retrieved the sack Elise kept the finished shirts in, as well as the sack that held the nettles she collected the previous week. He bowed to her as she passed him.</p><p>As Elise headed over the crest of the hill, she could hear the swans clicking and grunting, calling to her. Elise squared her shoulders and walked on, not daring to look back at her struggling brothers.</p><p>Elise kept herself schooled and her features set as the guards guided her through the palace grounds. Her gnarled hands grew clammy, and she could feel her heart beating faster in her chest, but no one would have guessed this by the noble expression she fixed on her face.</p><p>All too quickly Elise stood in front of King Torgen.</p><p>\u201cI was wondering where you\u2019ve been hiding. No one has had so much of a glance at you since my son left,\u201d King Torgen said over a banquet table that was laden with food. He bit into a drumstick and studied Elise\u2019s escort. \u201cWhere are the birds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey flew off, My King,\u201d the soldier holding Elise\u2019s bags of knitting supplies said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>King Torgen narrowed his beady eyes at the soldier and slurped his wine.</p><p>The soldier kept his expression plain; his manner did not betray his lie.</p><p>He probably had practice.</p><p>King Torgen shrugged and returned his attention to Elise. \u201cAlthough my soldiers might be incompetent bird catchers, at least they managed to find you. Sit. We must chat.\u201d</p> <p>One of the soldiers pulled out a chair from the banquet table, placing it close enough that King Torgen could speak to Elise in a plain voice but far enough that Elise could not reach the table.</p><p>Elise wondered if the soldier did this on purpose to keep her out of strangling reach as she sat down and the guard set her knitting materials on the ground next to her.</p><p>\u201cAt ease,\u201d King Torgen said to the guards. \u201cReturn to your posts.\u201d</p><p>The guards moved to the corners of the room, standing at attention.</p><p>King Torgen watched them go before he turned his rotten eyes on Elise. \u201cYou are disturbing my son.\u201d</p> <p>Elise folded her hands on her lap.</p><p>\u201cHe used to be an empty-headed fool, wandering about like an idiot and blithely doing whatever he wished. Now he talks of loyalty and love, and despairs that none of our subjects love us with passion and perseverance. He was useful as a fool. But now he thinks about people\u2019s feelings. I cannot believe it took him so many months to gather enough selfishness to go fishing. He hardly is at home in the late summer. Because of you, he\u2019s been kicking up his heels, talking to people, giving servants the day off,\u201d King Torgen tossed his chicken leg aside in disgust. \u201cI intended to let him be an idiot until I no longer felt like ruling, and then I would break him to make him a suitable king to rule a place as forsaken and wretched as Verglas. But I cannot let him head down the path of nobility. What use are loyalty, respect, and honor? None! So I must cleanse him of these stupid notions you have given him.\u201d</p><p>King Torgen looked to Elise, as if he expected a reply.</p><p>It took every ounce of Elise\u2019s courage to stare King Torgen down. She was sweaty and her heart thundered as loud as ever, but Mikk would have been proud of the emotionless expression Elise gave the twisted ruler.</p><p>King Torgen picked up the chicken leg again. \u201cI shall have you executed,\u201d he said in the same conversational tone a person would discuss the weather in.</p><p>Elise\u2019s chin quivered for a moment before she snapped down on the reaction and tilted her head back.</p> <p>\u201cYes, I must,\u201d King Torgen said, as if imagining her contrary claims. \u201cThis new sickness of his is most certainly acquired from you. I suppose I could exile you, but I\u2019ve always loved a good killing.\u201d</p><p>Elise clenched her hands together, making them tingle with pain as she stared at the monster hiding in a man\u2019s skin.</p><p>\u201cI cannot have you hanged of course, and I cannot give you a trial. Everyone knows you\u2019re harmless and quite wretched. But there is one thing I can accuse you of that will remove all those pesky barriers,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is your own fault. Someone should have taught you as a child that good doesn\u2019t always triumph. In fact, it rarely does. Loyalty and love are for the fools in this world,\u201d King Torgen said, leaning back in his chair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sorry you\u2019re going to die. I quite look forward to it, actually. It\u2019s so fun to crush the weak and the innocent,\u201d King Torgen said. \u201cNow, pick up your sack and show me what is inside.\u201d</p><p>Numbly, Elise did what she was told.</p><p>\u201cAh-hah! I thought so. Guards, arrest this girl! She is a witch, and must be put to death,\u201d King Torgen said, leaping to his feet.</p><p>The guards approached Elise.</p><p>\u201cWhat proof is there, My Kin\u2014,\u201d one guard asked.</p> <p>\u201cYou want proof? Look in her bags and see the foul, dark magic she knits,\u201d King Torgen said.</p><p>\u201cIt is cowls made of nettles,\u201d a soldier said.</p><p>Shirts, Elise internally corrected him, her mind blank as she listened.</p><p>\u201cOnly one devoted to dark arts would use such a loathsome plant. Who knows what foul end she would use them for? Besides, I can smell black magic miles away, and it is plain to me that she not only possesses it, but she loves it. Arrest her! Shackle her and throw her into the dungeons.\u201d</p><p>One guard collected up Elise\u2019s knitting materials; another clasped heavy iron shackles around her wrists.</p><p>Elise caught a glimpse of King Torgen\u2019s smirk. He won. No, it wasn\u2019t even a matter of winning. Elise never stood a chance.</p><p>Elise opened her mouth to shout out her innocence, but she caught sight of the sack of shirts. She was so close. She couldn\u2019t speak now. It would ruin all her work. Elise knew in her heart that Arcainia couldn\u2019t wait the months it would take Elise to knit seven shirts again. Arcainia need the princes now.</p><p>Elise shut her mouth and let herself be led away. When the guards led her out of the dining room and shut the door behind them, peals of laughter escaped from the chamber. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>King Torgen was an evil, twisted man.</p><p>Elise was led down stairs, into the bowels of the wooden castle. Elise never thought such a pleasant-looking place could have such a foul corner in it, but it did.</p><p>The dungeons were made of black stone. Even light from the torches was swallowed up and muted by the oppressive atmosphere.</p><p>It was silent, like the stillness of a body after the skeleton fingers of death strangled the last gasps of life from it.</p> <p>The guards led Elise to wooden door set in the black stone and opened it. It was an empty cell. There was nothing in it\u2014not even a pile of dirty straw or a bucket. Once inside the cell, Elise could see that the wooden door had deep gouges, as if someone clawed at it, and was spattered with blood.</p><p>There was one window in the room, but it was at least a foot above Elise\u2019s head, so she could not see out it.</p><p>Elise shivered as the guards removed the shackles and set her nettles and shirts down on the ground.</p><p>\u201cMay whatever has guarded you thus long be with you, my lady,\u201d the last guard said before he closed the door.</p><p>Elise shivered in the cool air and looked at her knitting. There was still a chance she could complete the last shirt. She would have to take the biggest gamble of her life and hope she could finish it before King Torgen finished her.</p> <p>Elise squared her shoulders and settled down to work, unearthing her knitting needles and the last of her nettles. She wouldn\u2019t fail Arcainia, and she wouldn\u2019t let her brothers suffer anymore.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>Elise worked as long she had light, and even after the last bit of sun left the open window, Elise knitted, blindly feeling the rows of loops and knots. For once she was grateful she was knitting nettles. They rewarded her with a sharp, stabbing sensation that bit into Elise\u2019s fingers when she looped them correctly.</p><p>Elise was so intent on her work that she almost missed the footsteps outside her window. She jumped when something slammed against the bars of the window.</p><p>\u201cElise?\u201d</p><p>Elise stood and ran to the window. \u201cRune?\u201d the cell wasn\u2019t wide enough for Elise to back up and see outside the window, but she would recognize that voice anywhere.</p> <p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Rune asked.</p><p>\u201cNever mind me\u2014what are you doing here? If the guards catch you, they\u2019ll drag you before King Torgen,\u201d Elise hissed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been climbing around the castle since I turned human. Security is tighter than I thought. I tried breaking into the dungeons, but there are too many guards,\u201d Rune grunted as a scraping noise echoed in the cell.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t rip the bars out, Rune. They\u2019re set in stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to try. I can\u2019t leave you here.\u201d Rune said before he toppled from the window. His shadow covered the window again shortly after as he boosted himself back up into the window.</p><p>\u201cRune, it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not,\u201d Rune said, sawing at the bars with a knife. \u201cBrida spent the whole afternoon trying to pinpoint your location, but she couldn\u2019t slip past security.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you could?\u201d</p> <p>Rune chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m not the heroic brother just because of my good looks,\u201d he said. \u201cHold on. I\u2019ll be back; I just need to find a pick-axe of some sort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. How many minutes until you turn back into a swan?\u201d Elise asked.</p><p>\u201c...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot many, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasted too much time trying to get into the dungeon entrance. Don\u2019t worry, I will get you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t know that,\u201d Rune argued.</p><p>\u201cRune,\u201d Elise said, cutting him off. She swallowed in the silence and shut her eyes as she leaned against the wall. She heard a scraping noise, and looked up to see Rune stretch his arm down through the bars.</p><p>Elise reached up and clasped his hand, squeezing it tightly. \u201cI\u2019m afraid,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cSwan or not, I won\u2019t let you die, Elise,\u201d Rune promised.</p><p>Elise nodded. \u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Elise held Rune\u2019s hand even after all the blood drained from her arm. She clung to him like he was her lifeline.</p><p>All too soon, Rune said, \u201cI have to go.\u201d</p><p>Elise loosened her grasp on his hand.</p><p>Rune, however, didn\u2019t let go. \u201cWe won\u2019t leave you, Elise. I won\u2019t leave you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>Rune squeezed her hand again before he slipped from the window, disappearing into the night.</p><p>Elise brushed tears from her eyes, and she turned back to the last shirt. While Rune spoke to her, the moon had risen high in the sky, shedding just enough light for Elise to knit by.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way I could sleep, so I may as well work,\u201d Elise said, sitting down on the floor. \u201cKing Torgen is wrong. Goodness wins, and love always triumphs.\u201d</p><p>Dawn came. The red rays of rising sun leaked into the cell, giving Elise light to see by. Her knitting was no longer neat rows, but downright sloppy. The loops weren\u2019t even, and some holes were too big, but Elise didn\u2019t have time to worry.</p><p>Not long after the sun rose, the door to her cell swung open. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cElsa, it\u2019s time,\u201d a guard said.</p><p>Elise stopped knitting long enough to place a hand on her rebellious stomach when it heaved. She swept up the capes and grabbed the last fistful of nettles she had left before the guards could say otherwise.</p><p>The guards didn\u2019t shackle her this time, and one kindly took her six finished shirts from her, letting her knit and carry the seventh cape.</p><p>\u201cWhatever reason you do this for, I think it is time you admit the loss,\u201d a guard softly said.</p> <p>Elise ignored him. She was so close. She would free her brothers and leave Verglas, or she was going to die by King Torgen\u2019s hand.</p><p>The guards led Elise outside and into a cart. Elise sucked in the fresh air, grating for the change after spending the night in the dank dungeon.</p><p>As the cart rolled along, Elise buried herself in her knitting. If she acknowledged the guards\u2019 pity or her own fear, she would crumble.</p><p>When the cart stopped, Elise glanced up and paled. All warmth fled her body as she stared at the tool of her destruction, a massive pile of wood gathered around a pole.</p><p>She was going to be burned at the stake.</p> <p>Elise tried to swallow, but her mouth was too dry, so she yanked her head down and kept knitting as the soldiers helped her down from the cart.</p><p>\u201cGood; you\u2019ve brought her tools of witchery. Throw them in the fire with her,\u201d King Torgen said, rubbing his hands as he gleefully inspected the kindling and wood.</p><p>Citizens of Ostfold left their homes, gathering in the city square where Elise\u2019s burning was to take place.</p><p>Elise was tied to the stake by a guard who wrapped rope around her waist, leaving her arms and legs free. Elise inspected the seventh shirt. The front and back of the shirt weren\u2019t stitched together all the way, but it would have to do. She was out of nettles and time. As Elise tied it off, she studied the crowd. Somewhere... she would be somewhere...there!</p><p>Brida was near the front of the crowd, a dark expression pasted on her face, and a sword strapped to her belt.</p><p>She was going to attempt a rescue. It was a valiant idea, but they stood a better chance if Elise\u2019s foster brothers weren\u2019t birds, and if she could talk. Elise tried to get Brida\u2019s attention, but the captain was busy watching the guards.</p> <p>A tremendous splash from the city fountain drew Elise\u2019s attention. Floundering in the fountain was a large white bird. A swan!</p><p>When it looked at her, Elise desperately held up seven fingers and waved them in the air, but bodies moved in and the crowd stood in between them, blocking sight of the swan.</p><p>Elise hoped the swan was Falk\u2014otherwise everything was going to be in vain.</p><p>King Torgen adjusted his crown and turned to the crowd. \u201cCitizens, you are gathered here today to witness justice at its finest. It was discovered that this girl, whom many would think to be innocent or perhaps a little mad, practices dark arts.\u201d</p><p>Elise\u2019s lip curled in disgust as she cast her knitting needles aside and shook out the seventh cape.</p><p>A guard moved to put Elise\u2019s six shirts on the wood at her feet, but when Elise stretched out her hand, he draped them over her arm.</p><p>\u201cShe has on her person burial shrouds knitted with foul intensions and made with the stems of the Stinging Nettle. We have no doubts of her crimes,\u201d King Torgen said.</p><p>Most of the Ostfold citizens hung back in the city square, but several of the more blood-thirsty variety crowded to the front.</p> <p>\u201cBurn the witch! Burn her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet the fire crack \u2018er bones!\u201d</p><p>What a terrible place. No wonder the assassins guild is legal, Elise thought as she strained her neck and looked in the sky for seven white swans. Where were they?</p><p>\u201cAs you know, the penalty for practicing black magic is to be burned at the stake in accordance with the law, the burning is being held in a public place for all to see. Are there any objections?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBurn her! Burn her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeath to dark magics!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo witches allowed in Verglas!\u201d</p><p>Only a few citizens shouted insults, but the rest of the crowds knew what speaking out would mean. So they watched Elise with sad eyes that expressed their sympathy and terror.</p><p>Elise wanted to hate them for refusing to question their king. But when she glanced at him, his revolting smile made her shiver, and Elise supposed it was too much to ask for a people who were ruled by him.</p><p>\u201cThen let the burning commence,\u201d King Torgen said, gesturing to a soldier who held a torch.</p><p>Elise listened for the flapping of wings. Instead, she heard a very familiar shout\u2014the one Brida uttered during her sword exercises.</p><p>Brida lunged at the soldier, her silver sword flashing in the morning light. The soldier dropped the torch when he dodged the blow. Other guards moved in, engaging Brida in combat.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the witch\u2019s minion. Restrain her!\u201d King Torgen said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Brida kicked a guard in the kneecap while blocking a blow from another. She elbowed one man in the throat and swept a leg back to smash a soldier in the face. It was little more than a brawl, but Brida was winning.</p><p>The crowd murmured, watching Brida fight tooth and nail. In all likelihood, no one had attempted to rescue one of King Torgen\u2019s victims before.</p><p>\u201cI said restrain her,\u201d King Torgen repeated, growing testy.</p><p>More soldiers left their post to help their comrades in the scuffle.</p> <p>Elise gaped at Brida as the determined female fought her way to her. The captain used every piece of her body to fight back. She head-butted one soldier, bit the fingers of another, and kneed a man in the stomach.</p><p>Eventually the soldiers gave up subduing her and used sheer numbers to drag her down. Before Brida hit the ground, she drew a dagger from her belt and threw it to Elise. A soldier tackled her when she made the throw, so her aim faltered, and the dagger hit a log near Elise.</p><p>Elise reached for it, but it was too far away. She tried reaching out with a bare foot, straining to grasp it with her toes. It was still too far away.</p><p>\u201cYou, get a torch and set fire to the witch,\u201d King Torgen said, grabbing a soldier who was helping one of the men Brida lashed out at.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014,\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou question me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Sire,\u201d the soldier said, grabbing another torch.</p><p>Unlike the other torch-bearer, this soldier hurried. He thrust the torch into the kindling and tinder, which caught fire immediately. The lower logs were smeared with animal fat and lamp oil, so the kindling flared into a fire faster than usual.</p><p>Elise started to sweat as she strained against the ropes, still reaching for the dagger. The straw used as the tinder produced a lot of smoke, and it burned Elise\u2019s eyes and throat. Her eyes teared up as she struggled through the haze to grab the dagger. The heat of the fire started to warm her feet when the first swan burst through the smoke.</p><p>Steffen.</p><p>Elise stared, but when the swan flew past her Elise gave up on the dagger and threw a shirt at the bird. It hit him, but Elise didn\u2019t see what happened after as he disappeared through the smoke.</p> <p>Elise could hear the crowd gasp and shout, but she was watching for the next swan, huddling as close to her stake as she could while the fire crept up the logs.</p><p>Two swans appeared next, flapping their wings and bringing a breath of clean air with them.</p><p>Nick, Mikk.</p><p>Elise threw the shirts, and the swans disappeared.</p><p>Elise covered her mouth with an arm, tears streaming down her face from the smoke. Her eyesight was so blurred she almost missed the next two swans. They swooped in from opposite directions, and one passed close enough to brush her extended hand with the tips of his wings.</p><p>Erick, Rune.</p><p>It was a stretch to hit both swans, Elise almost missed one but the swan dove into the shirt before disappearing in the smoke.</p><p>Seconds after they passed through, the smallest swan flapped past. Elise tried throwing the shirt, but her strength was leaving her as the heat licked at her skin and the smoke robbed her lungs.</p> <p>The swan veered after the shirt. Elise couldn\u2019t be sure what happened after that.</p><p>Gerhart.</p><p>Elise couldn\u2019t stop coughing, and the smoke blinded her. She reached out, her arm extended and shaking, the shirt dangling from her finger tips.</p><p>Falk, where was Falk?</p><p>Elise tried to keep the panic down as her arm trembled. The heat was unbearably painful.</p><p>Something tugged the shirt out of her fingers, and Elise let go before she sagged against the stake, the ropes wrapped around her waist holding her upright. The air was hot. It hurt to breathe in, and the smoke rattled in her chest and burned her throat.</p><p>She hoped it worked. She hoped she broke the curse, but she couldn\u2019t see, and she couldn\u2019t hear anything over the roar of the hungry fire.</p><p>The flames hadn\u2019t yet reached her, but the heat was agonizing. It was a thousand times worse than knitting. Elise thought she would be boiled alive, but suddenly she wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>Rune, dressed in white, cut through the ropes holding her to the stake. His hair was tousled and his face was streaked with dirt, but in Elise\u2019s eyes he was the most glorious thing she had seen in a long time.</p><p>Rune was human in daylight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got you,\u201d Rune said, tossing the bindings aside before he scooped Elise up and leapt from the pyre.</p><p>Elise coughed as she breathed in clear air. She clung to Rune as someone poured buckets of water on them, soothing Elise\u2019s pink, burned skin.</p><p>Rune held her upright as she sagged, unable to regain her breath as she hacked and coughed.</p><p>\u201cElise, breathe shallowly,\u201d Erick instructed, placing his cool hands on her forehead.</p><p>When Elise was able to draw air without shaking, someone hugged her.</p><p>\u201cElise, you did it,\u201d Nick grinned.</p><p>Surrounding Elise in a ring of white were the Princes of Arcainia. Steffen, Nick, Mikk, Erick, Rune, Gerhart... and Falk.</p><p>Tears streamed from Elise\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks to you,\u201d Steffen said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Elise started crying in earnest when her foster brothers pressed in around her, hugging her, wiping soot off her face, and thanking her.</p><p>\u201cGuards, seize them all! Clearly the girl has freed these evil demons with her work,\u201d King Torgen shouted.</p><p>\u201cFather?\u201d</p><p>King Torgen swiveled, his face growing stormy when a small party of men rode into the city, Prince Toril in the lead. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cThat woodland witch you brought back from the forest has unleashed a curse,\u201d King Torgen said.</p><p>Prince Toril dismounted his horse. \u201cElsa isn\u2019t a witch,\u201d he said as he made his way through the crowd, heading for Elise.</p><p>When he neared the ring of Arcainian princes, Rune appeared behind him and held a dagger to the prince\u2019s throat. \u201cTake another step closer to her, and you will breathe your last,\u201d he warned.</p><p>\u201cRune,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cBe still, Buttercup,\u201d Falk said, taking Elise\u2019s hand to hold her still.</p> <p>\u201cSee?\u201d King Torgen said. \u201cWitchery!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilence,\u201d Steffen said. Unlike King Torgen, who spoke with anger that welled up from his belly, Steffen\u2019s voice came from his chest. He sounded regal and commanding, and his eyes were sharp as he stared at King Torgen like the evil man was nothing more than a tadpole.</p><p>The Ostfold city square was quiet, except for the crackling of the raging fire.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014,\u201d Prince Toril started, even though Rune still held a weapon to his throat.</p><p>\u201cI am Crown Prince Steffen of Arcainia. You have almost succeeding in killing my beloved baby sister, F\u00fcrstin Elise. I am close, very close to the edge of my temper. One wrong word to me or my siblings, and I will bring your country to its knees,\u201d Steffen said. Although his voice was hushed the words carried clearly over the crowd.</p><p>When no one moved, soldier, citizen, or otherwise, Steffen nodded at Rune, who removed the dagger from Prince Toril\u2019s throat and pushed the young man away from them.</p> <p>\u201cHow do I know you are who you claim to be?\u201d King Torgen said, the feverish light shining fiercely in his eyes.</p><p>Steffen smiled. It wasn\u2019t his charming portrait smile. It was a smile that made Elise afraid. \u201cWould you like us to repeat, line by line, every good Arcainia provides Verglas and every debt you owe us?\u201d</p><p>King Torgen said nothing.</p><p>Erick cleared his throat and spoke next. \u201cWe require a change of clothes for our sister, horses, food, and weapons for transport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone,\u201d King Torgen said, looking at several soldiers, who departed to gather the goods.</p><p>Prince Toril looked back and forth between the Arcainian Princes and his Father. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. Aren\u2019t you going to stop them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuiet, Toril,\u201d King Torgen said.</p><p>\u201cNo, why are you so frightened? Yes, it looks like you were doing something bad, but they\u2019re just from Arcainia. Arcainia is a small, feckless country. We have nothing to fear from Arcainia,\u201d Prince Toril said.</p> <p>\u201cQuiet,\u201d King Torgen said, clenching his meaty hands into tight fists.</p><p>\u201cSo, you don\u2019t know?\u201d Nick said, folding his arms across his chest.</p><p>\u201cKnow what?\u201d Prince Toril said.</p><p>\u201cArcainia practically owns Verglas,\u201d Gerhart says. \u201cWe bought up all your national debt. If we call it in, you are sunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no surprise he doesn\u2019t know. We tried to downplay our power. It\u2019s the only way we could keep Loire clueless,\u201d Erick said as he studied Elise. \u201cFeeling better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Brida,\u201d Elise said, her mouth thick with the taste of smoke.</p><p>\u201cRight. The valiant soldier. Nick, Mikk,\u201d Erick said.</p><p>The twins stepped forward and yanked Brida from the clutches of Verglas guards, who surrounded her.</p><p>The captain joined Elise and her foster brothers.</p><p>\u201cWater, F\u00fcrstin?\u201d Brida said, offering Elise a flask.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Elise said, taking it and drinking. The water was stale and lukewarm, but it felt wonderful on Elise\u2019s raw throat.</p><p>\u201cI will take Brida and retrieve the horses and whatever supplies we can salvage from the cottage,\u201d Nick said, glancing at the captain.</p><p>Brida nodded.</p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d Erick warned.</p><p>Nick and Brida disappeared into the crowd.</p><p>\u201cElsa, I don\u2019t understand. What\u2019s going on?\u201d Prince Toril asked as he made his way back to Elise and her foster brothers. When he drew too close, Rune again reached out and pressed the point of his dagger to Prince Toril\u2019s throat.</p><p>\u201cRune, it\u2019s fine,\u201d Elise said, her voice scratchy from the smoke. \u201cPrince Toril, I must apologize. My name is not Elsa, it is Elise. Brida, my guard, lied to keep me safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was for your brothers, wasn\u2019t it? They were why you knitted,\u201d Prince Toril said. His boyish, bright features were downcast.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Elise said, glancing at Falk when he squeezed her hand.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t you stay with me?\u201d Prince Toril asked, yanking Elise\u2019s gaze back to him.</p><p>Elise\u2019s jaw almost dropped as she stared at the sincere prince. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have grown to love you,\u201d Prince Toril said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rune snarled, and Mikk dove to hold him back. \u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d he told his younger brother.</p><p>\u201cYes, I can,\u201d Rune said, his voice rumbling like a wolf\u2019s growl. \u201cOne jab, and he\u2019ll never speak again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo messy. We\u2019re trying to leave, not get ourselves thrown in a cell,\u201d Erick said, his voice lowered.</p><p>Falk placed a hand on Elise\u2019s shoulder. \u201cElise almost died by his father\u2019s hands; I would say it\u2019s already messy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPrince Toril, you cannot love me. You do not know the first thing about me,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cBut I do,\u201d Prince Toril said. \u201cI have watched and talked with you while you have lived here in Verglas. I have paid attention to your actions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you have not heard me speak a word of my mind. You know nothing about my feelings or the state of my heart. The fact that you would ask me to stay here when your father almost killed me is proof enough. You do not love me, Prince Toril. Not really.\u201d</p><p>Prince Toril\u2019s eyes were glassy with pain. \u201cI want to try to,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are a good woman, Elise. You must be to sacrifice for your brothers as you have.\u201d</p><p>Ah. That was it. \u201cWhat you are searching for, Prince Toril, is for a girl to love you as deeply as I have proven to love my foster brothers,\u201d Elise said, benevolently smiling.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Prince Toril said, his voice hushed.</p><p>Rune\u2019s handsome face twisted. \u201cFor the love of\u2014can I kill him now?\u201d</p><p>Steffen studied the Verglas prince, as if considering the request.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the only woman in this world who is capable of such love,\u201d Elise said. \u201cAnd before you can hope to woo such a woman, you must be able to give the same kind of love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut didn\u2019t I help you?\u201d</p><p>Falk\u2019s face grew stormy, and Elise worried that Rune might actually stab the foolish prince, so she spoke quickly. \u201cYou did help us. I thank you for the shelter you provided for me and my guard and my brothers. However, friendship is all I can offer you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFinally,\u201d Gerhart muttered when Verglas guards leading horses and a pack pony entered the city square. Nick and Brida were right behind them.</p><p>\u201cElise should ride my horse with me,\u201d Falk said, taking his horse\u2019s reins from Nick. \u201cHe\u2019s large enough to carry two of us, and I doubt she can ride alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean to leave now?\u201d Prince Toril said.</p><p>None of the Arcainian princes bothered to answer him as they set about divvying out mounts.</p><p>\u201cUp you go,\u201d Rune said to Elise before he boosted her onto Falk\u2019s horse. Falk mounted up behind her a moment later, his arms sliding around Elise as he gathered up the reins.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t you rather eat or change before you leave?\u201d Prince Toril asked, reaching for the skirts of Elise\u2019s damp dress. Falk wheeled his horse around before the prince was able to touch her.</p><p>\u201cWe will be fine. Thank you, Prince Toril. Take care,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>Truth be told, she longed to eat and soak in water before riding out, but Elise wasn\u2019t stupid. She knew the longer they stayed in King Torgen\u2019s presence, the more danger and risk they put themselves under. Soon the King would decide that national debt or not, he could just as easily kill them all as he could send them off.</p> <p>This was why Elise bore the swift pace her foster brothers picked as they left Ostfold, leaving the charming city behind. Her muscles ached; her eyes still stung, and her throat was sore, but Elise couldn\u2019t stop smiling as she looked at her foster brothers.</p><p>The eight royal siblings, and Brida, made their way through Verglas. They camped only when the sun fell, and they rose before the sun so they could be on their way when the first rays crossed the horizon.</p><p>They were almost to the Loire border when Rune\u2014who was in the lead\u2014and his horse barely missed being bowled over by a comet.</p><p>Once her eyes adjusted to the light, Elise realized it wasn\u2019t a comet, but Angelique on her night-sky mount.</p><p>\u201cLady Enchantress,\u201d Steffen said.</p><p>\u201cGreetings, princes and princess of Arcainia,\u201d Angelique said, pulling her mount in a circle. \u201cAllow me to extend my happiest of congratulations in breaking the curse,\u201d she said, sliding from her mount. \u201cIt was fortuitous timing, might I add. I was almost to Loire when I felt your curse shatter; it made finding you an easy task. Elise, your dedication and sacrifice are to be commended.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you been cleared before the Veneno Conclave?\u201d Erick asked.</p><p>\u201cSadly, no. But I do not think it will matter. I spoke to a close friend of mine, a fairy godmother from Erlauf,\u201d Angelique said, clasping her hands together. \u201cWe concluded that outside aid would be unnecessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can defeat Clotilde on your own?\u201d Gerhart said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo. Not even close.

What happened to you, princess?\u201d Angelique said, daintily covering her mouth.</p><p>Elise was too tired to care, or she would have blushed. As it was fall, all the ponds and rivers they rode past were too frigid to bathe in, so Elise still wore her grey dress\u2014which was now more of an ash black color\u2014and smelled like and resembled a chimney sweep.</p><p>\u201cI was almost burned at the stake. You were saying?\u201d Elise asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, no. This is unacceptable. We must get you properly cleaned up and fed. I would have thought your brothers would see to that,\u201d Angelique said, wagging a finger of displeasure at Elise\u2019s brothers.</p> <p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t their fault,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Steffen said.</p><p>\u201cWe were, perhaps, overzealous in our desire to leave Verglas,\u201d Mikk said.</p><p>\u201cYou noticed that just now?\u201d Angelique said. \u201cHowever, you are in good luck. It just so happens that a companion of mine has set up camp nearby. We make seek refuge in his house and draw up plans for your stepmother,\u201d she said before climbing up the leg of her odd mount. \u201cThis way, if you would.\u201d</p><p>Elise\u2014mounted on her own horse\u2014followed her brothers and the enchantress. Brida rode at her side, keeping her from lagging behind.</p> <p>Several times Angelique sent glittering balls of light to scout ahead. When they came back a third time, the enchantress led them straight to a makeshift camp that reminded Elise of her temporary shelter by the pond.</p><p>There was a sorry-looking tent that was stretched to its limits and looked as if it would collapse at any moment. The fire was out. There was no firewood in sight, and tethered next to the tent was an ornery donkey.</p><p>Angelique opened the tent, which was just as ratty inside as it was outside. \u201cHe\u2019s not home, but he will not mind if we use his hot water and salon,\u201d Angelique said, letting the cloth covering fall back in place before she traced a symbol in the air.</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon, Lady Enchantress, but what salon do you refer to?\u201d Gerhart asked.</p><p>Erick shook his head. \u201cJust wait,\u201d he instructed.</p><p>Elise, just as confused as Gerhart, was surprised when Angelique pulled back the tent flap a second time. This time the tent opened into a large parlor roughly the size of Elise\u2019s room back in Castle Brandis. It was well lit and warmed by a roaring fire in a marble fireplace. There was a pile of cushions, two padded, strange-looking sofas, and a small, short table covered by a silver tea set.</p> <p>\u201cPlease, enter,\u201d Angelique said.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Lady Enchantress,\u201d Steffen said, bowing before he led the way inside.</p><p>Elise craned her head to look at the exterior of the tent. No, her eyes were not deceiving her. Even though the inside of the tent opened into a large room, there was nothing outside but the measly tent.</p><p>\u201cThe owner of this tent is particularly skilled at enchanting, building, and producing material goods. He made the tent, which is similar to a large safe in that it is the doorway to different parts of his home,\u201d Angelique said when Elise and Gerhart were the only ones left outside.</p><p>Elise and Gerhart exchanged looks before they entered together, embraced by the sudden warmth of the room.</p><p>\u201cPrinces, and friend,\u201d Angelique added, glancing at Brida. \u201cPlease seat yourselves. I will be back momentarily with tea and refreshments. Elise, if you would follow me,\u201d Angelique said, picking up the tea tray before she disappeared through a door at the far side of the room.</p><p>On the other side of the door was the most lavish bathroom Elise had seen. There was a fireplace that had an iron grid built above the fire coals. This grid was laden with rocks, which the flickering flames licked as they burned the coals.</p><p>The floor was tile, and on the far side of the room was a large tub. Next to it was a rope\u2014which Angelique pulled\u2014and part of the ceiling collapsed down, filling the tub with water.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s lukewarm, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll want it hot,\u201d Angelique said, testing the water before she used a set of tongs to remove several stones off the grid. She dropped them one by one into the tub, making hissing steam whenever a rock hit the surface of the water. Angelique tested the water again. \u201cPerfect. You can bathe as long as you like. Here are towels and something for you to wear, and here are some oils if you cannot get the smoke smell out of your hair,\u201d the enchantress said, setting a fluffy towel on a wooden chair before indicating to several small bottles placed on a stand next to the tub.</p><p>\u201cThere is no need to hurry. I\u2019m certain your brothers are starving. I will see them fed. You may join us when you wish,\u201d Angelique said, pulling a velvet curtain around the tub for Elise\u2019s privacy.</p><p>\u201cYour friend won\u2019t mind this?\u201d Elise asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, certainly not. Stil enjoys entertaining, especially when he\u2019s not here,\u201d Angelique said before she left the bathroom through a different door, taking the tea tray with her.</p><p>Elise scrubbed herself until she was pink, getting rid of every smudge and splotch of dirt that caked on her over the past few weeks. She soaked and rinsed her hair several times until her tired curls regained some of their spring. By the time she left the bath she was as wrinkled as a prune and smelled like freshly cut lavender.</p><p>The dress Angelique had set out faintly reminded Elise of her Treasury Department uniform. It was black with white sleeves made of fine, opaque material. The sleeve cut off at her elbow and turned into a long black cuff that encased her forearm and hooked around her middle finger. The dress lacked the gold braiding Elise\u2019s work uniform had, but the belt was a gold sash, and there were several golden ribbons and a pair of black silk slippers set out as well.</p><p>Elise tied her hair back with one ribbon and used the remaining two to make a new loop to hang the treasury vault key from. She discarded the dirty red rope she had made from her old uniform\u2014it was stained and ratty\u2014and slipped on the shoes before she deemed herself presentable and left the bathroom.</p> <p>\u201cPerfect timing, princess. Your brothers were just asking after you,\u201d Angelique said from one of the odd-looking sofas. \u201cPlease, come have some tea and scones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look much better. You were quite bedraggled and scruffy before.\u201d Falk said, blasting Elise with a backhanded compliment as he inspected her from head to toe. \u201cNot that you didn\u2019t have reason to be,\u201d he added.</p><p>Rune smiled fondly before he slid a hand beneath Elise\u2019s chin. \u201cYou look beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t she though?\u201d Steffen said, crowding Rune away from Elise.</p><p>Elise seated herself next to Angelique and took the hot tea the enchantress offered her. It smelled like peppermint, but it was sweetened with honey and a little milk.</p> <p>When Elise\u2019s stomach growled, Erick passed a plate laden with scones and tea sandwiches.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Elise said, devouring a chicken sandwich.</p><p>\u201cI do not mean to rush you, Lady Enchantress, but you said you knew of someone who could break the curse?\u201d Steffen asked.</p><p>Angelique topped off Elise\u2019s tea. \u201cI do: F\u00fcrstin Elise.\u201d</p><p>Elise choked on her sandwich.</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d Steffen blinked.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I see where this is going. We cannot ask Elise to do more for us,\u201d Rune said.</p><p>\u201cHer hands will take months to heal, even if I purchase the best creams and plants to make pastes for her. She cannot do a thing more,\u201d Falk said.</p><p>\u201cElise has done more than her fair share,\u201d Gerhart chimed in.</p><p>\u201cI agree with what you say,\u201d Erick said. \u201cBut perhaps we should hear out the Lady Enchantress first.\u201d</p><p>Angelique smiled when the brothers quieted down. \u201cAs I mentioned, after I left you, I called on my friend in Erlauf. She used to be in charge of seeking out young boys and girls who are gifted with magical talents before she became a fairy godmother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI discussed with her the oddity that the curse worked on every Arcainian royal\u2014Gabrielle excluded\u2014except for you,\u201d Angelique continued. \u201cAfter conversing further, we concluded that the only logical explanation is you have the ability to use magic as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but that\u2019s impossible. There would have been signs. I wouldn\u2019t be the royal family\u2019s foster child,\u201d Elise said. \u201cMagic is not something a person can hide. Furthermore, I would know! There\u2019s no possible way I could be ignorant of an ability like that.\u201d</p><p>Angelique shook her head. \u201cYou are ignorant because of the way your powers manifested. Observe,\u201d Angelique said. She drew her fingers together, making a glittering ball of light. She flicked her fingers, and the ball rolled in Elise\u2019s direction. When the ball touched Elise, it bounced off her and faded away like smoke.</p> <p>Angelique made a second ball and flicked it at Erick. It stuck to him like a burr, remaining there until Erick crushed it with his fingers.</p><p>\u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d Elise asked.</p><p>\u201cIt means your powers, probably as a result of the country you live in, lie in magic cancelation. Magic cannot survive around you. Thus a curse, even one as powerful as the one Clotilde used against you, will not work,\u201d Angelique said. \u201cThe curse couldn\u2019t hit you, but it was powerful enough to survive contact with you, so it bounced back and hit Clotilde.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is my understanding that it is difficult for other magic users to hide their powers from each other. How could no one have discovered Elise before now?\u201d Erick asked.</p><p>\u201cProbably because Elise\u2019s magic doesn\u2019t feel like magic. I didn\u2019t notice it myself until I touched her and felt my powers go mute,\u201d Angelique said. \u201cElise does not give off the aura of magic because, to put it simply, her presence devours all traces of magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd our curse?\u201d Mikk said, rubbing his chin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, how was Elise able to break our curse if her touch cancels magic?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cBreaking a curse is an entirely different matter than human-made magic. It deals with a deeper power that would easily override Elise\u2019s magic,\u201d Angelique said.</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t understand,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>Angelique tilted her head as she thought. \u201cThe magic I use\u2014the magic any enchanter or enchantresses uses, Elise included\u2014is a sort of surface magic. It is using your personal powers to change things. The magic that went into breaking your curse was a far deeper and older kind of magic that existed long before any enchanter walked these lands. Using love to conquer darkness is a power as old as the oceans. It is not surprising that Elise\u2019s powers would have no affect on such potent magic. Once the steps are taken, no one can stop the consequences of a sacrifice made from love.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo how can I destroy her? Do you mean for me to wake Father from his stupor?\u201d Elise said.</p><p>Angelique sipped her tea. \u201cI\u2019m afraid the task before you is much bigger than that. You must cut her off from her power source. Clotilde\u2019s powers are nothing special, but if you cancel the magic of the artifacts she uses to prepare her big curses, she will expire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Erick asked.</p><p>\u201cClotilde has put her life into those artifacts. If you destroy them, you destroy her,\u201d Angelique said.</p><p>Steffen pressed his fingertips together. \u201cCan you guarantee Elise\u2019s safety?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. We know nothing about Elise\u2019s abilities. There may be limitations, but I do not know how to properly test a magic student\u2014I\u2019m still an apprentice. Additionally, the testing process is a lengthy one. Based on the news I heard in Erlauf, I\u2019m not certain Arcainia can hold out much longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNews? What news?\u201d Rune asked.</p><p>Angelique rubbed her tea cup with her thumb. \u201cYou royal siblings have worked to increase Arcainia\u2019s power and wealth under your supervision. You have succeeded, but the country does not flourish without you.\u201d</p><p>Steffen relaxed. \u201cOf that we are well aware.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs such, Arcainia has not prospered under Clotilde\u2019s rule. Her presence is evil, and the land is rejecting her. There was a famine this year\u2014almost all crops were lost to blight or fungus. A storm hit Carabas harbor and nearly destroyed it. Without Prince Rune\u2019s frequent patrols, more magical creatures with ill-intensions entered the country. Several villages were destroyed by those creatures. The army is underfunded and will not be able to survive much longer without proper finances, and as Clotilde lacks access to the majority of the country\u2019s funds, she has raised taxes to support her spending.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow high are the taxes?\u201d Elise asked, her eyes narrowed.</p> <p>\u201cToo high. After the massive crop failure, many of your subjects are unable to pay the tax. Normally, they would leave and become refugees, but your subjects trust you, and they\u2019re waiting for your return,\u201d Angelique said. \u201cBut Clotilde does not let them go unpunished.\u201d</p><p>Elise stared at her welt-covered hands. Clotilde was going to ruin the country and beat all of their subjects into submission. Arcainia was suffering.</p><p>\u201cWe will have to do something,\u201d Mikk said. \u201cNot Elise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time we take some of the burden,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>Gerhart stood to snag a marmalade tart. \u201cI try to look useless, but I don\u2019t relish the idea of Elise being the only one in our family responsible for our country\u2019s freedom,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWe can do nothing more today. That much is clear,\u201d Steffen said, rubbing his eyes.</p><p>\u201cDaylight is all but gone. If we set out for Arcainia, we would not get very far,\u201d Rune agreed.</p><p>\u201cWe may spend the evening here,\u201d Angelique said.</p> <p>\u201cYour friend will not mind?\u201d Elise asked.</p><p>\u201cStil? No. Even if he comes home, I doubt he will notice our presence, although I must apologize, for he does not have enough rooms for us all,\u201d Angelique said.</p><p>\u201cNo matter, we men will sleep here. There are plenty of cushions, and we\u2019re used to spending our nights in much more uncomfortable places these days,\u201d Steffen said, the corners of his mouth turning wryly.</p><p>\u201cDoes he have a room for Elise and Brida?\u201d Rune asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Angelique said.</p><p>After another hour or two of discussion, Angelique showed Elise and Brida to a guest room\u2014which was just as lavish as the bathroom.</p><p>Elise relished the feeling of soft, clean sheets and a feather-stuffed mattress, but her mind would not settle even after Brida blew out the last candle.</p><p>Elise couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Arcainia. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When Angelique first said Elise could defeat Clotilde, Elise wanted to cry. Hadn\u2019t she done enough? She almost died freeing her brothers, and more was required of her? But even as she wallowed in her misery, the faces of her friends and servants back home played a continuous loop in her mind.</p><p>There was sweet Gretta from the Treasury Department; she always made sure Elise had tea to serve any visitors; Flora, the pastry chef\u2014she slipped Elise extra treats whenever it had been a rough work day; and Otto, King Henrik\u2019s valet who thought to routinely send Elise a stomach tonic when she first joined the royal family and, unused to the sheer amount and richness of food, made herself sick with her greed on a daily basis. Even those Elise didn\u2019t personally know she remembered\u2014the guards on their patrols who took the time to bow and smile, the hotheaded bunch of secretaries from the Commerce Department who ate like a flock of seagulls, even the kind-hearted stable hands of the royal stable that knew of her fear of horses and worked with her to disguise it.</p><p>The Treasury Department employees alone were enough to make Elise reconsider, but the longer Elise remembered who was back in Arcainia, the more convinced she was that she had to do something. What forced her to make up her mind was the memory of her father, King Henrik.</p><p>He was a great man, always warm and friendly. Even though the Royal brothers sometimes took pains to remind Elise she was a fosterling, King Henrik never withheld affection or love from her. He showered gifts and attention on her like she was one of his own children.</p> <p>Elise couldn\u2019t abandon him to Clotilde\u2019s clutches.</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>In the late hours of the night, Elise slid out of her warm bed. She shivered in the cool air and felt her way around the room. She found the slippers Angelique had given her and slipped them on. She eased the door open and was halfway through it when Brida spoke.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a question.</p> <p>\u201cIt is unlikely my brothers will allow me to try to take Clotilde on,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if there\u2019s a chance I can free Arcainia, I must try, even if it is risky and foolish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Brida repeated, lighting a candle before she tossed blankets off her body. Like Elise, Brida went to bed fully clothed. However, she went a step further and still had her weapons strapped to her. \u201cWhich is why I will accompany you.\u201d</p><p>Elise stared at the captain. \u201cYou knew I was going to leave tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suspected,\u201d Brida said, shouldering the supply bag she had brought into the bedroom. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p> <p>Elise and Brida tiptoed through the strange house, blowing out the candle when they found the salon. Coals still glowed in the fireplace, giving them just enough light to see by as they slinked through the treacherous maze of male bodies.</p><p>Elise\u2019s brothers were strewn through the room, and their outstretched limbs made it difficult to wade around them and get to the door. Elise almost fell once to avoid stepping on Mikk\u2019s arm when he moved it unexpectedly, but Brida caught her and set her upright before they sprang the last few steps to the door.</p><p>They exited the salon, or tent as it was, and almost rammed into Angelique.</p><p>\u201cPrincess Elise, Captain Meier. How surprising,\u201d she said, her face illuminated by the glittering sky.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Lady Enchantress. What brings you outside at this hour?\u201d Elise asked, stalling so she could come up with a legitimate reason for their presence.</p><p>Angelique indicated to the sky. \u201cI was checking on my mount. I rode him longer than usual, and I wasn\u2019t sure what condition he would be in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Elise said, wondering why the beautiful enchantress pointed to the sky.</p><p>Angelique studied Elise and Brida, but refrained from imposing a similar question on them. All the same, Elise blurted out, \u201cDo you really believe I can take on Clotilde?\u201d</p> <p>Angelique nodded. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do I need to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour bare touch should be enough. It seems that you do not toggle your powers on and off, but you constantly use them. As a result, you do not need to worry about activating anything on your end. Clotilde keeps her tools for her dark magic on her at all times. If your magic is strong enough, your touch will cancel her magic, as well as the artifacts\u2019 magic. It will be her end,\u201d Angelique said.</p><p>\u201cIf my magic is strong enough?\u201d Elise asked.</p><p>Angelique nodded again. \u201cI have no way of measuring your magic, so I cannot tell you if your powers are enough to smother everything. The way you attack her would make a difference, I suppose. Skin to skin contact would provide the best channel for your magic to reach her. The more contact, the better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>Brida slid her pack off her shoulders as she approached her tethered mare. \u201cYour powers were enough to keep you from being cursed, F\u00fcrstin. I am certain you are strong enough to defeat that witch.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you, Brida. I wish I had your confidence,\u201d Elise said. \u201cWe are leaving tonight, before my brothers wake. They will never let me face Clotilde, and I feel that I must try.\u201d</p><p>Angelique smoothed the skirt of her iridescent dress. \u201cI think you underestimate your powers of persuasion over your brothers, Princess. If you tell them you feel strongly on the matter, I suspect they will bow to your wishes.\u201d</p><p>Elise felt her heart squeeze in her chest, as if a hand were crushing it. \u201cPerhaps,\u201d she agreed, thinking of the sleeping princes with their soft snores and strewn limbs. \u201cBut, but,\u201d she struggled for a moment to school herself. \u201cI cannot risk them again. I almost lost them, and I could not live with myself if Clotilde cursed them a second time,\u201d she said, her voice nothing but a whisper.</p><p>There was a long space of silence.</p> <p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Angelique said.</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d Elise perked up.</p><p>Angelique\u2019s smile was painful. \u201cMore than I wish I did. You must leave now if you are to have a chance of confronting Clotilde without your brothers. When they wake, I will hold them off as long as possible, but they know you. The instant they realize you have left, they will set out after you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll have to make the best use of our head start,\u201d Brida said, handing Elise the reigns of Brida\u2019s tacked up mare.</p><p>Elise blinked; she hadn\u2019t noticed when Brida started saddling the horse.</p> <p>\u201cYou will need to go slowly. It is dangerous to ride in the dark. It is your good fortune that tonight is a full moon,\u201d Angelique said, looking to the sky.</p><p>\u201cWe are a stone\u2019s throw from Loire. Arcainia isn\u2019t far beyond that. What time we gain by leaving tonight should be enough to keep us ahead,\u201d Brida said as she saddled Falk\u2019s horse.</p><p>\u201cOne can hope,\u201d Angelique said. \u201cIf you excuse me, I will take my leave of you here. If your brothers ask, I can truthfully say I did not see you leave. I wish you a safe journey and great luck in your venture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for everything, Lady Enchantress,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cI am glad I can be of assistance,\u201d Angelique said before she disappeared into the tent/parlor.</p><p>\u201cI like her,\u201d Elise announced, handing Brida\u2019s mare off to the captain before she took the reins of Falk\u2019s fidgety horse. (Elise almost wished Brida had chosen another horse, for he was big and flighty as well as fast, but she supposed she may as well end her journey on the same horse it started on.) \u201cShe is a good sort of enchantress,\u201d Brida said, swinging up into the saddle.</p> <p>Elise mounted Falk\u2019s horse and followed Brida when the confident soldier set out at a walk. \u201cThank you, Brida.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what, F\u00fcrstin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor traveling with me, for risking your life for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a person worth risking my life for, F\u00fcrstin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>With Brida leading the way, they made excellent time. They crossed the distance to Arcainia much more quickly and efficiently. A journey that had taken Elise a week (towing swans and mostly walking) took but a few days.</p><p>When they reached the Arcainian border, it was early morning, and the sky was still pink with dawn.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll avoid towns as much as possible, but we\u2019re out of food, and the horses could use some grain. We stop at Trakau for those things. I will make our purchases, but I dare not leave you in the forest. You\u2019ll need to come with me, but do not speak a word and keep your hood up,\u201d Brida said.</p><p>\u201cIs it so bad if we are recognized?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t expect trouble from the people, but they will be able to tell your brothers what direction we set out in,\u201d Brida said.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it fairly obvious we will make for Castle Brandis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but if we\u2019re not careful, they will intercept us on the way there. I imagine we were able to keep our lead as your brothers do not know Loire, but now that we are back on Arcainian soil, Prince Rune will be able to lead your brothers on paths that are not common knowledge and are much quicker to transverse,\u201d Brida said, rolling up a map.</p><p>\u201cI do not think we, as siblings, give Rune\u2019s intelligence enough credit,\u201d Elise said. \u201cHe is the sneakiest of all the princes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps. Hood up,\u201d Brida said before she rode off.</p><p>Trakau was only a few minutes away. Elise stood with the horses while Brida bargained for grain and foodstuff. Elise could see the foul effects of Clotilde\u2019s rule in Trakau, just as Angelique said.</p><p>The people were thinner. Arcainia was famous for their chubby, red-cheeked subjects, but everyone living in Trakau looked gaunt, their eyes glassy like marbles. The available market goods were few and expensive. Normally the place should have been overflowing with corn, squashes, and gourds at this time of the year.</p><p>Elise nearly jumped out of her dress when a peasant woman touched her elbow, pulling her from her stormy thoughts. \u201cPrincess Elise?\u201d</p><p>Still used to holding her tongue, Elise stared at the woman and backed up into Brida\u2019s mare. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt is you,\u201d the woman said. She spoke in a hushed tone, but it was as if a wind carried her guarded words to every person in the village.</p><p>The little business being conducted in the market fell silent. The washerwomen stopped washing clothes to stare, and a farmer with a load of wilted hay even pulled his large draft horse to a stop in the middle of the road.</p><p>Everyone stared at Elise.</p><p>Brida is going to be fuming.</p> <p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d Elise asked.</p><p>The woman reached out and took Elise\u2019s right hand, lifting it up for inspection.</p><p>Although Elise\u2019s bath had remarkably improved her hands, the outdoor travel and time away from Falk\u2019s various concoctions undid all that good work. Her hand was still spotted with oozing welts, and her fingers were painfully curled from the mad rush of knitting to finish the last of the capes. Her hands were ugly.</p><p>Tears formed in the peasant woman\u2019s eyes, and she turned around to look at her friends and neighbors.</p><p>All at once everyone began moving again.</p> <p>One man fixed a feedbag filled with sweet grain on Brida and Falk\u2019s horses. A peasant woman wrapped a cloth around a block of cheese and packed it in Elise\u2019s saddlebag while the village farrier picked out the horses\u2019 hooves.</p><p>Elise watched all of this happen as the woman held her hand. \u201cPardon me, we couldn\u2019t possibly\u2014I do not know how much money we have on us... Brida!\u201d</p><p>Brida was at Elise\u2019s side in a moment. \u201cWhile we thank you for your service, I regret to inform you all that we cannot possibly pay for this,\u201d Brida said as a child filled their water skins from the village well and replaced them on the horses.</p><p>\u201cWe require no payment,\u201d the farrier said, using a handkerchief to dab at the sweat on his red face.</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d Elise started.</p><p>\u201cIt is our pleasure, Princess,\u201d the woman who held Elise\u2019s hand captive said. She bowed over Elise\u2019s hand and released her.</p> <p>\u201cBut,\u201d Elise repeated.</p><p>\u201cOur hearts go with you,\u201d the man with the feedbags said after he unclipped the bags from the horses.</p><p>Elise mulishly tucked her head, but stopped when Brida placed a hand on Elise\u2019s elbow. \u201cLeave it be, F\u00fcrstin. We must be thankful and keep moving.\u201d</p><p>Elise reluctantly turned to her subjects. \u201cThank you. I can\u2019t imagine what this will cost you, but thank you.\u201d</p><p>Brida and Elise mounted up and set off, waving farewell. When they just left the village, a youth on a swift horse galloped past them.</p><p>\u201cHm,\u201d Brida said, studying the horse and rider as they disappeared.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Elise asked, her shoulders stiff with strain as she clung to the saddle.</p><p>\u201cWe may soon have company.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUnwanted company?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>Elise and Brida\u2019s travels across Arcainia had a ripple effect. Although they avoided towns and villages, people lined the dirt roads Brida chose to travel on. They were not loud. No one cheered or shouted or waved flags. It wasn\u2019t like the frequent parades Elise and her foster-brothers were put on display for.</p><p>Instead everyone was solemn. They were silent as Brida and Elise rode past, but the occasional child would throw the last flowers of fall on the road. They typically bowed, murmuring encouragement under their breath.</p><p>\u201cLuck be with you, Princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur strength is yours, F\u00fcrstin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe stand with you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrincess.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014Bless the princess.\u201d</p><p>Brida seemed unbothered by the attention, but Elise beheld it with fear. Although the people were quiet, the unmistakable shine of hope lit their eyes. They looked to Elise to save them. What terrified Elise was that for the first time in her life she wasn\u2019t sure if she could save them. No amount of hard work or discipline would win this battle. Elise could do nothing to assure her victory. She would either beat Clotilde, or she wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I can\u2019t do this, Brida?\u201d Elise asked, her voice tight as she and the captain rode side-by-side past a family of farmers.</p><p>\u201cYou must trust you are strong enough. You must accept that you, more so than any of your siblings, are fit to be the savior of Arcainia. Doubting will only ruin your confidence. Believe, F\u00fcrstin,\u201d Brida said.</p><p>Sooner than she wished, Elise and Brida were at gates of Castle Brandis.</p><p>\u201cSteady, F\u00fcrstin,\u201d Brida said before they rode into the city.</p><p>\u201cPst, Princess!\u201d a dirty, sharp-faced girl in an alleyway said. \u201cPrincess Gabrielle sent me. This way,\u201d she said when she had Elise and Brida\u2019s attention. She scampered up the alley, taking them off the main road.</p><p>Elise dismounted Falk\u2019s horse so she could lead it through the trash-heaped alley, barely able to keep an eye on the little girl who jumped from place to place like a flea. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The girl led them on a long, winding route, and just when Elise feared they were being led into a trap, they popped out of alleyway and through a back gate used by soldiers, taking them straight into the servants\u2019 portion of the castle. Two stable boys, who were waiting at the gates, took the horses from Elise and Brida before the girl led the way to a servant entrance into Brandis.</p><p>The girl left them in an empty corridor and went skipping back outside.</p><p>\u201cWell done Elise, Captain Meier. You have made it to Brandis safely.\u201d</p><p>Brida unsheathed her sword and Elise spun around, looking for the speaker. \u201cGabrielle?\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Elise peered down the hallway. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I apologize. I forgot. Puss, if you would please?\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle\u2019s black and white cat leaped out of thin air, and Princess Gabrielle shimmered into existence. The princess wore plain clothes\u2014a skirt that was barely knee length, men\u2019s breeches, and black boots Elise was shocked to see\u2014but the trial had not dimmed her beauty. Gabrielle still glittered with a natural splendor most women would envy. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of you,\u201d Gabrielle said, embracing Elise.</p><p>\u201cWhat? How did you\u2014?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAngelique has been in contact with me. She told me how you broke the curse, but we have to hurry. Your brothers are not an hour behind you,\u201d Gabrielle said.</p><p>\u201cWhat? How did they catch up so quickly? We should have half a day on them,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cIt is not surprising. Half the country witnessed the route we were going,\u201d Brida said.</p><p>\u201cI suspect Clotilde is also expecting you,\u201d Gabrielle said.</p><p>A chill invaded Elise like icy hands grasping at her throat. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is in the throne room. No one has spoken a word of your travels, I can promise you that,\u201d Gabrielle said, glancing over her shoulder as if the witch queen could hear her whispered words. \u201cShe has grown stronger in your absence and likely felt you enter Arcainia through her dark powers.\u201d</p> <p>Elise leaned against a wall, letting the cold stone support her as her sister-in-law and guard continued the conversation.</p><p>\u201cEven if the Queen is aware of F\u00fcrstin Elise\u2019s presence, an ambush is not out of the realm of possibilities,\u201d Brida said.</p><p>\u201cWe could jump her in a hallway. She has a usual orbit she makes through Brandis\u2014it is unusual for her to remain in the throne room for such a lengthy amount of time,\u201d Gabrielle said, unrolling a map of Castle Brandis and holding it against a wall. \u201cWe have a short while until tea time. She eats here, in the Sun Solar with King Henrik,\u201d Gabrielle said, tracing a path on the map with her finger.</p><p>\u201cThe best place for an assault would be here. A smaller space is ideal. F\u00fcrstin Elise must be in close quarters with Clotilde,\u201d Brida said, pointing to a narrow hallway.</p><p>\u201cWe have at least half an hour before she leaves the throne room to pick our spot and fortify it. Wouldn\u2019t you agree, Puss?\u201d Gabrielle asked when her black and white cat leaped to her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cAt least,\u201d the cat said. (So that part hadn\u2019t been a dream. Elise had been hoping it was.) \u201cPerhaps closer to an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent. We must warn the servants, but we must also mask the point of attack or Clotilde will expect it,\u201d Brida said.</p><p>\u201cYes. She isn\u2019t very bright, but even Clotilde\u2014Elise?\u201d Gabrielle asked.</p> <p>Elise left the wall and started walking down the hallway. \u201cNo,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cNo, what?\u201d Gabrielle asked, taking a few quick steps to catch up with her.</p><p>\u201cThere will be no ambush; there will be no waiting,\u201d Elise said. \u201cI will face her now. There is no point in delaying it. I will either match her power or I will not,\u201d Elise said, making for the throne room.</p><p>\u201cBut Elise\u2014\u201d Gabrielle started.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure that is wise, F\u00fcrstin?\u201d Brida asked.</p><p>Elise stopped walking and spun on her heels to face Brida, puffed up like an angry cat. \u201cIf I wait much longer, my brothers will arrive. I will die before I let that witch touch them again,\u201d Elise hissed before she marched off, her black skirts swirling around her like angry storm clouds.</p><p>\u201cBravo,\u201d the cat said.</p><p>\u201cThen I will go with you,\u201d Gabrielle said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d the cat hissed.</p><p>\u201cIt would be shameful to ask Elise to stand alone. I don\u2019t have any magic, but I will do my best to support you,\u201d Gabrielle said.</p><p>\u201cI will not accompany you,\u201d the cat said. \u201cThe princess stands a chance with her magic; your presence would be like presenting Clotilde with a fattened calf with a bow tied round its neck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d Gabrielle said.</p><p>\u201cI too will stand with you, F\u00fcrstin,\u201d Brida said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Elise said as she started up a staircase. \u201cThe, the c-cat is right,\u201d Elise said. She never imagined a moment when she would agree with a cat. \u201cIt will be too dangerous for both you. I should face Clotilde alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a chance,\u201d Gabrielle said.</p><p>\u201cOut of the question,\u201d Brida said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you two to sacrifice yourselves for my sake,\u201d Elise said when they left the staircase and entered the main part of the castle. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut it\u2019s perfectly acceptable for you to sacrifice yourself for the sake of the country?\u201d Gabrielle asked.</p><p>\u201cF\u00fcrstin, do you know why I stayed with you in the trees when you were angered with your brothers?\u201d Brida asked, placing a hand on Elise\u2019s shoulders and forcing her stop her ruthless march.</p><p>\u201cI assumed it was out of duty or pity,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cPartially, yes. As a guard of Arcainia, it was my duty to see to your wellbeing. But more than that, it was because it is not good to fight a battle alone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou assume Prince Rune battles monsters on his own, yes?\u201d Brida asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course. I have seen him single-handedly kill vile creatures,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d Brida said, jabbing a finger in the air. \u201cPrince Rune kills the monsters alone, yes, but he never battles alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fail to see a difference between the two,\u201d Elise said.</p> <p>\u201cPrince Rune might be the only man pitted against whatever ill creature has done Arcainia harm, but he is never there alone. Usually there is a squad of soldiers already fortified in the area who provide support for the prince. If there are no soldiers, then farmers, villagers, and everyday citizens will take up arms to support him. True, they never do any fighting, but they are always there to support Prince Rune.\u201d</p><p>Elise considered Brida\u2019s words and thought back on the times Rune took Elise monster-hunting with him. The captain was right. Rune never went alone into a fight. There was always a medical personal on alert and usually several other armed, burly men who made a wall behind Rune. Sometimes people were employed as distractions to make the kill easier.</p><p>\u201cWhen you knitted, you fought a battle just as brutal as the monsters Prince Rune faces. It was not good for you to be alone, which was why I made it a point to stay with you until Prince Falk recovered his wits enough to follow you,\u201d Brida said.</p><p>Her proclamation made Gabrielle\u2019s eyebrows raise, but the beautiful princess said nothing.</p><p>\u201cYou are entering another terrible battle. It is not good for you to enter into it alone, F\u00fcrstin,\u201d Brida said.</p><p>Elise mulled over Brida\u2019s words, glancing at Gabrielle when the older girl took her hand and squeezed it. \u201cAlright. But at the first sign of trouble you have to flee,\u201d Elise said.</p> <p>\u201cNever,\u201d Gabrielle said, embracing Elise before pulling her along. \u201cLet\u2019s go battle a witch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is ludicrous,\u201d the cat said from Gabrielle\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Gabrielle said.</p><p>\u201cYou have lost the complete use of your mental faculties,\u201d the cat said.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Gabrielle said as they turned up the hallway that ended at the throne room door.</p><p>\u201cYour plan is absolutely mad,\u201d the cat said.</p><p>\u201cIt is, but you wouldn\u2019t miss out on it for the world,\u201d Gabrielle said, pausing to scratch her pet under the chin.</p><p>The cat growled but did not speak further as the three mismatched warriors descended on the door attendant.</p> <p>\u201cCrown Princess Gabrielle, F-F\u00fcrstin Elise,\u201d he gasped.</p><p>\u201cShe is expecting us, Arthur. There is no need to announce us,\u201d Gabrielle said, tossing her head like a wild horse.</p><p>The middle-aged man studied the trio under drooping brows. \u201cAre you sure you want to do this, My Ladies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Elise said, pulling her shoulders back. Although her heart was painfully full of fear, she would not let it hold her back. \u201cThank you, Arthur.\u201d</p><p>The portly doorman bowed. \u201cAs you wish, Princess,\u201d he said before he opened the door and stepped aside.</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>Clotilde was seated in her throne, wearing a beautiful dress that was the deep green color of a peacock\u2019s feather. She wore Queen Ingrid\u2019s gold crown on her head and strings of diamonds woven into the braid of her blonde hair.</p><p>She smiled like a snake, her jaw opening disproportionately wide. \u201cDarling Elise, I knew I would see you again,\u201d Clotilde said as she stood.</p><p>Elise always thought as evil being black, but as she strode towards Clotilde, Elise realized that evil was not darkness, but a gaping hole. Clotilde\u2019s greed and desire for power infected the very air. She pulled every spot of goodness and beauty to her, devouring them and never filling.</p><p>Clotilde was evil because of her vast emptiness and the underhanded methods she used to steal, kill, and destroy others to fulfill her desires and wishes. Black magic wasn\u2019t black because of the color; it was vile because of the bottomless evil and the unspeakable acts it would do to get what its wielder desired.</p><p>At the foot of the dais the thrones were perched on, Elise halted. \u201cOf course,\u201d she said. \u201cSomeone has to set you in your proper place,\u201d her words faltered when she caught sight of King Henrik.</p><p>He looked far worse than when Elise had last seen him. His hair was almost completely grey, and his skin was slack, hanging from his body like an ill-fitting cloak. All of his muscle was gone, and he looked like he lost a significant amount of height. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Father, what has she done to you?</p><p>\u201cYou are more stupid than I thought if you think you can defeat me,\u201d Clotilde said, her nearly colorless eyes were dilated in spite of the light in the room. \u201cThere is nothing you can do. Your brothers and father are lost\u2014forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the contrary,\u201d a male voice said.</p><p>Elise turned around just in time to see her seven foster brothers enter the throne room, coated with dust but looking no worse for the wear.</p> <p>Elise could feel Gabrielle go taut like a violin string when she met her husband\u2019s eyes across the room. Her muscles jerked, as if she was barely controlling herself from throwing herself into Steffen\u2019s arms, but she stayed at Elise\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Clotilde said, her voice screeching like breaking glass. \u201cThat\u2019s not possible!\u201d</p><p>Elise tilted her head and studied Clotilde. The wicked queen didn\u2019t know? She didn\u2019t feel it when Elise broke the curse? Perhaps Elise was strong enough to defeat her after all.</p><p>There was a roar. Clotilde pulled two black diamonds from a pocket sewn into her gown. She held them above her head where they glowed, dark light emitting from them.</p><p>The diamonds were the evil artifacts Angelique had warned Elise of. She was going to do it again. Clotilde was going to turn Elise\u2019s foster brothers into swans.</p> <p>\u201cNO!\u201d Elise said in a scream wrenched from her soul.</p><p>\u201cGabi,\u201d the cat said.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d the crown princess said.</p><p>\u201cPositive. Do it,\u201d the cat said.</p><p>Just as the diamonds released black bolts of lightning, Gabrielle tossed her cat in the air. The feline intercepted the lightning bolts, which bounced off the cat as if they hit a mirror, burning the marble floor where they were diverted before dissipating.</p><p>Gabrielle caught her cat, tucking him under her chin.</p> <p>Brida unsheathed a sword. \u201cGo, F\u00fcrstin,\u201d the captain said as she crouched with her sword.</p><p>Elise took a deep breath before she charged up the first few stairs.</p><p>Clotilde narrowed her poisonous eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you managed to break my magic, but I can promise you, you won\u2019t free your brothers a second time,\u201d Clotilde said, gripping a black diamond in each fist. \u201cYou can\u2019t cower behind Princess Gabrielle\u2019s little cat forever.\u201d</p><p>Elise kept climbing the stairs.</p><p>\u201cDo you really think you can stop me, Elise? You are nothing but a fraud. You are even less royal than I am. You\u2019re not a princess. You\u2019re nothing but a street rat orphan,\u201d Clotilde said, spit flying from her mouth in her rage. \u201cYou strive to be portrait perfect, but in the end you will die, and everyone will hear of your failure,\u201d Clotilde said when Elise reached the top of the dais. \u201cAfter I am through with you, I will curse your brothers again and put them through agony before I have them killed and stuffed as mantle piece decorations. Once they expire, King Henrik will not be far behind. I will kill them all, but I will take the greatest pleasure in killing you.\u201d</p><p>Clotilde struck like a snake, moving to backhand Elise on the face. Elise caught her by the wrist and held it in an iron grip. \u201cNo, you will not,\u201d Elise said, her voice strong like the ocean.</p><p>Her fears had not left her, but Brida was right. She took strength in knowing Brida, Gabrielle, and all of her foster brothers were behind her. And Clotilde\u2019s threats? They enraged Elise.</p><p>Clotilde stared at the wrist Elise held, her eyes wide and her body stiff.</p> <p>\u201cYour first mistake was cursing my brothers,\u201d Elise said, reaching out to pluck Queen Ingrid\u2019s crown from Clotilde\u2019s head. \u201cIf you had just slit our throats, none of us would have survived. But your greatest mistake?\u201d Elise leaned in and whispered to the queen. \u201cThat was attacking my family.\u201d</p><p>Clotilde was rattled. She shook with anger and perhaps fear. Elise coldly observed the reaction, but wasn\u2019t satisfied. Her magic wasn\u2019t doing much, if anything, or Clotilde\u2019s response wouldn\u2019t be so mild.</p><p>What was it Angelique had said would help? Skin on skin contact\u2014the more the better. Very well, she could manage that.</p><p>Elise released Clotilde\u2019s wrist and latched her hand on the queen\u2019s face, covering Clotilde\u2019s eyes, nose, and mouth with her spread fingers.</p><p>Clotilde screamed but seemed unable to pull away from Elise. Her skin was hot, boiling hot under Elise\u2019s hand. The witch clutched her black diamonds in her fists but beat at her chest and ripped out chunks of her hair as she howled. She scrabbled at Elise\u2019s hand, scratching like a desperate cat.</p><p>Elise held on in spite of the pain, and grabbed Clotilde\u2019s shoulder to keep her from fleeing.</p><p>Stone cracked, and Clotilde\u2019s screaming intensified. She howled. Her skin burst with boils and oozing wounds before it turned dry and rough like old paper, crackling under Elise\u2019s fingers.</p><p>The screams died out, and Elise stepped back just before Clotilde\u2019s body turned into ash, leaving behind jewels, a pretty gown, and two black diamonds cracked through the center.</p><p>It was over. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cElise?\u201d</p><p>Elise snapped her gaze up from the pile of dust.</p><p>King Henrik stood.

Finally, the nightmare was over.</p><p>It took the better part of the afternoon to explain to King Henrik what happened. He didn\u2019t remember much since the wedding, so recounting the cursing of his children gave the king a great deal of pain.</p><p>\u201cHow could I be so foolish?\u201d King Henrik said, shaking his head when all the stories were told.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t blame yourself, Father. That woman was a snake,\u201d Nick said, taking a swig of cider. (Bless the servants who thought to bring refreshments when the family moved to the dining hall for storytelling.) Elise sat somewhat apart from her family, not due to any feeling of separation, but because it warmed her heart to see all of them at once.</p> <p>Steffen and Gabrielle were inseparable since Steffen\u2019s return. The pair looked controlled enough, but from her vantage point Elise could see that Steffen held Gabrielle\u2019s hand with trembling fingers.</p><p>Nick had coaxed Brida into joining the family, saying, \u201cYou were the only one who could talk during the day. It\u2019s only proper for you to tell your parts of the story.\u201d</p><p>Brida was sitting in a chair next to Nick, mostly silent, but she smiled whenever Nick flashed a grin at her.</p><p>A steady stream of men and women ghosted up to Mikk and whispered in his ear, most likely giving him the details of all that happened in his absence.</p><p>Gerhart, although listening to his family, was hard at work writing up invitations and sending out notices. \u201cDo you have any idea how far behind I am in social engagements? I was in the middle of a number of talks that have probably all gone sour or been forgotten since the snake\u2019s rule. I have to start over from the beginning,\u201d Gerhart sighed, laying an arm across his eyes when his brothers scolded him for working.</p><p>Rune and Falk were seated closest to Elise, so they were the ones who looked up when Elise finally spoke. \u201cI nearly forgot in all the chaos, but where is Angelique?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRecovering,\u201d Falk said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>Rune, more prone to give details, picked up the story. \u201cWhen we set foot on Arcainian soil, we set off some kind of curse. Apparently Clotilde worried we might return, so she set up some defenses. One of the curses alerted her to our presence\u2014that one was too fast for Angelique to get\u2014but the other unleashed a basilisk on us. Nasty thing,\u201d Rune said, shaking his head. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if I could take one on alone. Anyway, she sent us on ahead and said she could handle it. We didn\u2019t make it far before we heard explosions. She caught up to us on her flashy horse, but she was pale as snow and as cold as ice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid it hurt her?\u201d Elise asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Rune said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t get the chance. She hit it with the most powerful spells she had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is generally known that powerful magics cannot be used without incurring a sort of penalty or backlash. Typically it makes the caster ill or saps their strength. There are some exceptions of course,\u201d Falk said, eyeing Elise.</p><p>\u201cShe couldn\u2019t keep up with us in her condition, so we left her in a village on our way here,\u201d Rune said. \u201cShe assured us she would be fine. She just needed to recoup a little bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. You managed perfectly well anyway,\u201d Falk said.</p><p>\u201cGabrielle said her cat was going to check on her,\u201d Rune said, looking a little confused by the report. \u201cShe said he is an old companion of hers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoys, scatter,\u201d King Henrik said, seating himself in a chair next to Elise.</p><p>Falk scowled, but Rune placed a brotherly arm around him. \u201cYes, Father,\u201d Rune said before he and Falk joined the rest of their siblings.</p><p>Elise smiled at King Henrik when they left. \u201cI\u2019m so happy to see you, Father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I am overjoyed to see you,\u201d King Henrik said, patting Elise\u2019s hair. \u201cIt seems I have you to thank for saving not only my family, but our country.\u201d</p><p>Elise shook her head and ran her fingers on the edges of Queen Ingrid\u2019s gold crown, which was on her lap. \u201cIt was more than just me. I couldn\u2019t have done any of that without Brida, or my brothers.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFoster brothers,\u201d King Henrik said, absent-mindedly stroking his beard.</p><p>Elise nodded and looked down at the crown in her lap. After all of this, she was still just a foster child.</p><p>\u201cElise, darling, you know you are my daughter, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d Elise asked, raising her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cI have not adopted you and given you my family name for...various reasons. But you are still my daughter, as you are Queen Ingrid\u2019s daughter,\u201d King Henrik said. \u201cYou are her legacy. She chose you. She looked all over Arcainia to find you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Elise asked. \u201cWhy me?\u201d</p><p>King Henrik sighed. \u201cI knew one day I would have to explain this, but I never much wanted the day to come,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know why the use of magic is banned here in Arcainia? Why we can use magic-made goods and materials, but every enchanter, enchantress, or fairy godmother who visits us cannot use their magic while in our lands?</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Elise carefully said. Even though everyone knew the reason, openly discussing it was something of a taboo. \u201cIt was because Mother was an enchantress before she married you. The Veneno Conclave worried she might abuse her powers to better Arcainia. They agreed she could marry you only if she renounced her magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did, as you know. But the conclave feared her friends and allies might take it upon themselves to use magic in her stead, so they banned the use of magic in Arcainia all together,\u201d King Henrik nodded. \u201cBut what they banned was casted magic. Some people are gifted with natural magic, like you. From what your brothers tell me, this ability of yours to cancel out magic is always active. It is a part of your very being, and it is a power unique to you. You do not have the ability to be an enchantress, as Lady Angelique, but your powers are still magic.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cYour Mother, Queen Ingrid, had a bit of natural magic as well as her powers as an enchantress. It was nothing big; she could occasionally sense the future. She never saw complete pictures. It was more feelings and prophecies of what could come. After Rune was born, Ingrid foresaw her death was approximately two decades away. She also foresaw that your brothers and I would be in grave danger after her death,\u201d King Henrik said, shifting in his chair.</p><p>\u201cIngrid was a stubborn woman, and she knew she could not rely on her friends to aid us with magic being banned and all, so she searched far and wide for a person who could help us. She found you. I don\u2019t know if she knew about your powers. She didn\u2019t tell me everything she saw about you or any of us, I think to save us from ourselves, but she did see that if you remained with our family you would see us through, and quite possibly save the Arcainian empire. She did not wish to tell you this, fearing such a prophecy would burden you, but our eldest boys were made aware of the situation. Being unable to keep their mouths shut after we took you in as a fosterling, they shared the news with their brothers.\u201d</p><p>Elise vaguely recalled Gerhart complaining about everyone calling her the family savior. They must have discussed the situation when she was not around.</p><p>King Henrik cleared his throat. \u201cShe also foresaw some of your...mmmm...romantic entanglements,\u201d he said, tugging on the collar of the black jacket he wore.</p><p>\u201cShe foresaw that Rune and Falk would profess their love for me?\u201d Elise guessed.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d King Henrik said, looking relieved. \u201cMatters of the heart are tricky to foresee, so it was not set in stone, but she wanted to give you the freedom to choose whom you loved. That is why she forbade us from officially adopting you. As long as you remained a fosterling, you were free to love whomever you wished\u2014whether he be an Arcainian prince or a lowly blacksmith.\u201d</p><p>Elise nodded, pursing her lips.</p><p>\u201cYou are not surprised?\u201d King Henrik said.</p><p>\u201cAfter seeing my brothers turn into swans and holding a conversation with a cat, no. I can\u2019t say I am,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>King Henrik laughed and slapped his leg. \u201cElise, my darling daughter, you are certainly the daughter of Ingrid\u2019s heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is something that is still bothering me,\u201d Erick said, rapping a spoon on the table surface to get his family\u2019s attention.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Nick asked. \u201cAre you sad none of your little college attendees have come to check on you yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Why didn\u2019t the Veneno Conclave act against Clotilde? They chased after the Lady Enchantress Angelique fast enough. You cannot tell me they were unaware of Clotilde\u2019s activity. The woman was entirely lacking in subtlety,\u201d Erick said.</p> <p>\u201cIt is odd that they would allow dark magic to be used at all. It\u2019s been decades since a powerful dark magic user like Clotilde made so much as an attempt for power,\u201d Rune said.</p><p>\u201cOdd doesn\u2019t begin to describe it,\u201d Steffen said.</p><p>\u201cNo, Rune has a point of which he probably isn\u2019t aware,\u201d Erick said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGee, thanks,\u201d Rune said.</p><p>\u201cClotilde was not a powerful dark magic user. Her black diamonds were the real power,\u201d Erick said. \u201cWhere did she get them from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr whom,\u201d Mikk said.</p><p>\u201cYes, she wasn\u2019t the type to go searching for a dark power. She wouldn\u2019t be smart enough to recognize it if she saw it. Someone must have given them to her,\u201d Gabrielle said.</p> <p>\u201cIn other words, we can be sure Clotilde was acting with help,\u201d Rune said.</p><p>\u201cIs it possible that Clotilde was part of a bigger movement? One bigger than Arcainia?\u201d Steffen asked.</p><p>\u201cAnd the Veneno Conclave either cannot or will not counteract,\u201d Erick said.</p><p>\u201cOur wealth and exporting power are not common knowledge. I cannot think we would be the prime target for a reign of darkness,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>But the royal family turned grave as they dwelt on the possibilities.</p> <p>\u201cBut, that is a matter for another day,\u201d Gerhart said, springing to his feet. \u201cWe got rid of the harpy, and we\u2019re no longer birds. I think it\u2019s time we hold a celebration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA celebration?\u201d Mikk said, a frown evident in his voice.</p><p>\u201cGerhie is right. If now isn\u2019t time for a feast, I don\u2019t know when is. Lighten up, Mikk. We\u2019ll need dancing and food,\u201d Nick said standing up so he could bow and offer his hand to Brida in a mock dance.</p><p>\u201cAnd guests\u2014everyone should be invited from all over Arcainia,\u201d Gerhart declared.</p><p>\u201cAnd music and drinks,\u201d Nick continued.</p><p>\u201cAnd money,\u201d Elise said with a stone face.</p> <p>\u201cAhhhh, yes that would be the kicker,\u201d Nick said, grimacing.</p><p>\u201cI think our treasury could handle a small party, don\u2019t you think so, Elise?\u201d King Henrik said.</p><p>Elise, unable to refuse her father anything after the past few months, said, \u201cI suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurray!\u201d Nick said.</p><p>\u201cExcellent choice, Father,\u201d Gerhart praised.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d King Henrik said, leaning over to kiss Elise on the temple. \u201cI will use the occasion as an excuse to laud and praise you,\u201d he said before shaking his head and smiling in pride. \u201cMy daughter, F\u00fcrstin Elise, the savior of Arcainia!\u201d</p><p>Elise leaned back in her chair, a smile on her lips. She was startled when she realized Mikk stood at her side, his hands folded behind her back.</p><p>\u201cMay I have a moment of your time?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cCertainly,\u201d Elise said, standing up. She awkwardly brushed her skirts before joining Mikk in a stroll around the room.</p><p>\u201cYou know our family loves you for you, not for being perfect,\u201d he said when they were far enough away from the table that they wouldn\u2019t be overheard.</p><p>Elise weighed his words. \u201cYes,\u201d she said, surprised at the realization. She didn\u2019t know exactly when the change took place, but she pushed herself to break the curse and defeat Clotilde not out of duty but love.</p><p>\u201cYou know that I have never disliked you?\u201d</p><p>Elise blinked. \u201cWhat?\u201d It took her a moment to recall her emotional outburst the night she was told Rune and Falk loved her. She had accused Gerhart of being a brat and Mikk of holding her in distaste. \u201cUm,\u201d Elise awkwardly said.</p><p>\u201cI watched you. Out of curiosity,\u201d Mikk said. \u201cTwo of my brothers fell for you, that\u2019s surprisingly high odds. Also, Father told Nick and I to put a security detail on you or he would hang us from our ankles. No wooing or courting allowed,\u201d Mikk said, drawing a laugh from Elise. \u201cBut I never disliked you. You are my baby sister,\u201d Mikk said.</p><p>The sweet simplicity of his words made Elise\u2019s eyes water. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said, choked up.</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t have to be the Perfect Princess anymore,\u201d Mikk said, holding out Elise\u2019s flute in one hand, a small saw in the other.</p><p>\u201cMikk...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hate it. Break it.\u201d</p><p>Elise took the instrument with a grimace. \u201cNo. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t! Do you have any idea how much this thing costs? We could sell it to purchase a new set of carriage horses or to pay Brida\u2019s salary for half a year.\u201d</p><p>Mikk gave Elise a rare smile. It softened the normal stone bones of his face and brightened his eyes. \u201cElise, do it.\u201d</p><p>Elise swiveled the instrument in her grip and made a noise of distress.</p><p>\u201cI will pay a jeweler to peel off the gold work and melt it down after it is destroyed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk,\u201d Elise brightly said. She took the saw from Mikk, and after a moment of struggling to hold the saw and flute, Mikk took the instrument and held it secure while Elise sawed through it.</p><p>When it snapped, Elise held the two halves above her head. \u201cNever again!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever again,\u201d Mikk echoed.</p><p>\u201cNo more being perfect!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWay to go Elise!\u201d Nick said. \u201cWhat are we cheering for?\u201d</p><p>Elise smiled at Mikk and walked back to the table with him. \u201cThe beginning of new era.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds poetic,\u201d King Henrik said.</p><p>\u201cIt sounds wonderful,\u201d Elise said. \u201cOh, Mikk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI will be sending a Treasury Department employee to retrieve the gold.\u201d</p><p>Mikk\u2019s lips twitched in amusement. \u201cI cannot funnel it into my budget?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not allowed. No matter how I love you, dear brothers, your budgets are mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHear that, Falk? Even if you marry her, you\u2019ll still be paying through the nose,\u201d Nick said, elbowing his younger brother.</p> <p>\u201cShut up, Nick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo cruel to your big brother. Gerhie, stop writing and start drinking. This is a celebration!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that!\u201d</p><p>News spread fast and far of Queen Clotilde\u2019s defeat. The celebration lasted three days and three nights before the royal family divvied out duties to mop up the mess Clotilde made of the country in a few short months.</p><p>Rune, Nick, and Mikk set out with the army to clear the lands of all the monsters that flocked to Arcainia in their absence. Falk and Erick set out to take inventory of the lands and crops, hoping to plant winter crops to make up for the poor harvest.</p> <p>Gerhart and Steffen accompanied Gabrielle to her lands, Carabas, to see what could be done with the remains of the harbor.</p><p>Elise was the only royal child to remain behind in Castle Brandis, reinstating customs that Clotilde abolished (public lunches and breakfasts were the first thing Elise restored) and holding the central government together with King Henrik.</p><p>She cleared out Clotilde\u2019s quarters, sold all the luxury goods the vile queen bought, and reinstated officials to their previous positions.</p><p>When the dust settled, King Henrik met Elise for tea to discuss the country\u2019s future.</p><p>\u201cEven though she\u2019s gone, we may still be ruined,\u201d King Henrik said, his mouth a grim line on his face. Much of his youthfulness was restored to him, but there were new lines on his forehead and around his mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Elise asked.</p> <p>\u201cIt is like Clotilde\u2019s specter still hangs over us. With all of her wild spending and unbalanced use of magic, it seems she was doing her best to break the country to pieces. Although we wrestled it out of her control, there is only so much we can do. Your brothers have brilliantly managed their departments, but no country could bear what we have without going heavily into debt,\u201d King Henrik said. \u201cIf only I weren\u2019t such a fool! If I hadn\u2019t let her grip my mind...\u201d</p><p>Elise placed a comforting hand on top of King Henrik\u2019s fist. \u201cThere is something you need to see, Father. Come,\u201d she said, leading the way out of her office.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d King Henrik said, following Elise out of the Treasury Department\u2019s offices.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember when you first gave me control of the Treasury Department?\u201d Elise asked, glancing over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI do. You were barely fifteen, but the timing was too perfect to pass up as the previous department head announced his retirement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone thought you were mad for giving me such a responsibility,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>King Henrik smiled fondly. \u201cIngrid approved. So did Steffen and the rest of your foster brothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey did,\u201d Elise said as they walked to a more heavily patrolled, well-guarded section of the castle. \u201cAnd so did the previous department head. He stayed on for a summer to teach and mentor me before setting me loose to bargain and bully my brothers and their respective departments.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFoster brothers,\u201d King Henrik said, a smile creasing his lips.</p><p>\u201cThe Treasury Department was my dream post. I was thrilled when you assigned it to me. I\u2019ve always liked numbers, and it greatly assured me of the esteem and trust you\u2014and Mother\u2014placed in me,\u201d Elise said, leading the way through a squad of guards.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d King Henrik said.</p><p>Elise stopped outside a large, metal door.</p><p>There were two guards posted on either side of the door, but their presence meant very little. No one could get in without the key.</p><p>Elise slipped the key off her red sash and slid it in the oddly shaped lock. She let go of the key, which glowed. Something in the door clicked, and the metal door rolled away.</p><p>\u201cLike everything else I do, I did my absolute best at running the Treasury Department,\u201d Elise said, removing the key and stepping inside the treasury.</p><p>Inside the room were mountains of gold. It cascaded off the walls in flat coins and was stacked in corners in solid bars. There were certificates of debt from other countries that Elise had bought up, priceless jewels, mountains of foreign currency, and blocks of precious stones like jade, amber, and emerald lined up in solid squares that were taller than Elise.</p><p>Elise and King Henrik could only take several steps into the room, it was so crowded with gold and coins.</p><p>As the only possessor of the treasury key, Elise knew King Henrik hadn\u2019t set foot in the treasury in years, so she delighted in his awe. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cClotilde\u2019s antics will not break us.

But this... I never expected.\u201d</p><p>Elise\u2019s smile grew indulgent as she strolled up to her Father and placed her head on his shoulder. \u201cSo you will stop blaming yourself?\u201d</p><p>King Henrik linked his arms around Elise. \u201cYour vast wealth does not change the fact that what I allowed to happen is unforgiveable.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut it is,\u201d Elise said. \u201cThe one thing this wretched trial has taught me is that love covers a multitude of sins. Please, Father. I can\u2019t stand to hear you blame yourself. Forgive yourself.\u201d</p><p>King Henrik\u2019s shoulders heaved. \u201cAlright, my darling. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Elise said, linking arms with King Henrik as they turned to leave the treasury.</p><p>King Henrik glanced over his shoulder at the glittering wealth. \u201cNo wonder your brothers always hated budgeting with you. Nick complains bitterly that you make him itemize everything, and Falk always muttered you stole the royal profits and had unrealistic monetary return expectations for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. If he wanted money for agricultural research the expected return had to make it worth it,\u201d Elise said with a mad grin.</p> <p>\u201cThey don\u2019t deserve you, you know,\u201d King Henrik said.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Elise asked, locking the treasury door.</p><p>\u201cRune and Falk. Falk is too dense for you, and Rune has the shrewdness of a snake,\u201d King Henrik said.</p><p>\u201cIt warms my bones to see how you recommend your sons,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cNaturally, you always were my favorite,\u201d King Henrik said, his voice rumbling with laughter. \u201cSo which one will you choose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m giving them an equal chance right now,\u201d Elise said.</p> <p>\u201cJust be careful not to give any lad besides the two of them too much attention,\u201d King Henrik said.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFalk spent years toady-ing up to Mikk so as to use his army of sneaks, and Rune is the country\u2019s best warrior,\u201d King Henrik said.</p><p>\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t...\u201d Elise said.</p><p>King Henrik studied the ceiling. \u201cThey might have already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>King Henrik laughed and patted Elise\u2019s hand. \u201cNo matter. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be happy no matter which one you choose. They\u2019re good lads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Father.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course, my darling daughter.\u201d</p><p>As father and daughter strolled arm in arm, Elise thought of more ways to squeeze money from Falk\u2019s agricultural ventures\u2014especially now that she suspected she would be able to use her feminine charm to her advantage.</p><p>King Henrik, meanwhile, grew misty eyed over the thought that in several years he would very likely be walking in a similar manner with his daughter, only then it would be down the aisle of a cathedral.</p><p>King Henrik knew Elise was dedicated to her work, but he also knew she was a creature of steadfast love and loyalty. It wouldn\u2019t be long before her heart decided between Falk and Rune. He didn\u2019t know for sure, but King Henrik suspected he knew who she would choose.....</p><p>If you believe Elise grows to love Rune, click HERE. If you believe Elise grows to love Falk, click HERE.</p><p>Falk</p><p>After Clotilde was defeated, it took three weeks for loneliness to set in Elise\u2019s heart and two days for her to correctly identify the feeling.</p><p>The idea that she was lonely seemed ludicrous. After all, she could speak as much as she wanted, and her brothers were no longer available to her for only a single hour of each day but at all times. Yes, Brida was not her near-constant companion, but the two frequently shared meals together. Moreover, as a result of the Clotilde fiasco, Elise had grown closer to her brothers, Father, and even Gabrielle\u2014whose friendship she greatly enjoyed.</p><p>But still, the loneliness plagued her.</p><p>It would hit her at odd times, like when she was alone in her office in the evening hours. She would reach for a soft, feathery body that wasn\u2019t there. Sometimes when taking tea, she saved a crust of bread and would turn to give it to...nothing.</p><p>The only logical conclusion was that Elise missed Falk\u2019s constant presence, an outcome Elise did not want to dwell on much less recognize.</p><p>\u201c\u2014Did you even use the paste while I was gone? Your hands are puffy. You\u2019ve been working too much again. Your hands will not heal if you don\u2019t rest them,\u201d Falk said as he rubbed Elise\u2019s hands with a costly lotion he purchased while traveling with Erick. \u201cIt\u2019s been weeks since you last picked up a nettle, and your hands still haven\u2019t healed.\u201d</p><p>Yes, Elise really didn\u2019t want to recognize it.</p><p>\u201cAre you even listening to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Elise said, internally disgusted with herself. How could she miss this?</p><p>\u201cNo, you aren\u2019t. Or your hands wouldn\u2019t be so horribly abused. Open your mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJust do it.\u201d</p><p>Elise obeyed. She almost wretched when Falk popped a spoonful of bitter liquid in her mouth. She swallowed the concoction, but held her stomach as she produced gagging noises. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMedicine. It will strengthen and fortify you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel plenty fortified already, thank you. Couldn\u2019t you have done anything about the taste? It\u2019s like I swallowed mud a pig pooped and rolled in,\u201d Elise said, wiping her mouth.</p> <p>\u201cHere,\u201d Falk said, passing Elise a mug.</p><p>Elise eyed the contents and sniffed it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s water,\u201d Falk said, his voice wry.</p><p>Elise cautiously took a sip to assure herself that it was indeed water before gulping it down, anxious to wash away the bitter medicine. \u201cThat was awful,\u201d she said when she finished.</p><p>Falk expressively raised his eyebrows but said nothing as he arranged his clay pots and glass bottles.</p> <p>Elise raised a hand to inspect it. \u201cI think my hands look better. They don\u2019t hurt anymore, and the welts are mostly gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but they\u2019re flushed and discolored, and you have quite a bit of scarring,\u201d Falk said.</p><p>\u201cThank you for trying to make them look better,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cI think there is nothing wrong with them. They are beautiful,\u201d Falk said, his words peppered with a frown.</p><p>Elise ruefully shook her head. \u201cIn no way are my hands beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are. They are a visible symbol of your love and the sacrifice you made to free us,\u201d Falk said.</p> <p>\u201cIf they\u2019re so symbolic, why do you plague me with your horrible medicines?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you are ashamed.\u201d</p><p>Elise\u2019s heart leaped into her throat. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Falk tossed a rag on a nearby workbench. \u201cYou hide your hands whenever possible, and you wore gloves at that atrocious celebration our family threw. You do not like showing people your wounds. Which is a shame. It\u2019s no different than Nick or Rune\u2019s battle scars. It is something you should be proud of.\u201d</p><p>Elise stared at Falk.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d the goldenrod haired prince said as he started rolling bandages.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking it might make sense after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it makes sense.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, not my hands. Just\u2014I\u2019ve missed you. For the life of me I couldn\u2019t figure out why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou certainly know how to give a compliment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I missed your constant presence, but we would drive each other crazy if we were together all day long,\u201d Elise blurted out, saying things she didn\u2019t mean to say.</p><p>\u201cHow you warm my heart with your gentle sentiments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what I really missed was you, not your physical proximity, but you.\u201d</p><p>Falk put the bandages aside. \u201cWhat about me is there to miss? I scare your subordinates; I\u2019m antisocial, and I accidentally say mean things if one goes by Rune\u2019s hefty grasp of the subject.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thoughtful,\u201d Elise said, sliding off her stool. \u201cYou watch me, and you understand why I do things. You get why I keep our budgets tight, and why I am on a crusade to expand trade. You don\u2019t let me run reckless, doing whatever I want. You lecture me if I\u2019m in the wrong, and you see the best in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElise,\u201d Falk said, his tone worried.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not just about me. You\u2019re also clever and witty. And yes, I would be remiss if I did not mention you are handsome. But above all, you are thoughtful and gentle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElise. Please, don\u2019t,\u201d Falk said, his voice just above a whisper.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me hope.\u201d</p><p>The words were like an open chasm between them. They startled Elise. \u201cWhy not? Why not, if what I say is the truth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you don\u2019t love me, not the way I love you,\u201d Falk said.</p><p>Elise weighed his words. Did she really just see Falk as her foster brother? She didn\u2019t think so.</p><p>She loved Steffen, but being with him didn\u2019t make her speak carelessly. She knew Gerhart was quite handsome, but she was never struck by his looks. Rune was...Rune was her hero. But she didn\u2019t miss him the way she missed Falk. Things had changed since the night Elise and Falk discussed their relationship in the freezing waters of Lake Sno.</p><p>No, Elise certainly didn\u2019t see Falk as a foster brother, and she still loved him. So there was only one conclusion to make. \u201cBut I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do what?\u201d Falk said, his eyes scrunched shut as he rubbed his forehead.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Elise said, as if they were discussing line items in the Agriculture Department\u2019s budget.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you,\u201d Falk said.</p><p>Elise winced. \u201cAfter saying the same thing to you on numerous occasions I suppose I deserved that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEven though Father will leave the decision up to you, you will marry for the better of the country if Rune can\u2019t win you over.\u201d</p><p>Elise narrowed her eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s true; I forgot the financial aspect. Well, if you want to marry me, we will have to make sacrifices. Financial ones. I won\u2019t marry until Arcainia is back on track, and Carabas harbor is opened. But we\u2019re crafty. We will manage. We\u2019ll just have to increase our agricultural exports.\u201d</p><p>Falk blinked. \u201cI recognize I\u2019m not the most social man, but I am certain most women don\u2019t consider budgets and line items when talking about love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? You love me; I love you. That seems pretty settled,\u201d Elise said.</p> <p>\u201cThis is completely unromantic. Even I recognize it,\u201d Falk grumbled.</p><p>\u201cFalk,\u201d Elise said, stepping close enough to take his hand. \u201cWe are just getting over defeating a wicked witch. I spent the summer saving you and your brothers, and you spent the summer guarding me and looking for ways to ease my pain. As far as I\u2019m concerned, there was a cloud of dramatic tension and love hanging over our head for the past season. I welcome a clear-cut business goal to work towards that will also bring me personal happiness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t believe you,\u201d Falk said, his head tipped as he looked down at her.</p><p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d Elise said before sliding her arm behind Falk\u2019s neck and standing on her tip-toes so she could kiss him. She blushed heavily as their lips met.</p><p>Falk was so stunned, he did not respond for several seconds. Then he wrapped his arms around Elise, cradling her close.</p> <p>\u201cThis is your last chance to back out, Elise. I love you. If you return my love, I will never let you go, and I will drive this country forward until you feel we can marry,\u201d Falk said, his voice hoarse.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve made my choice, Falk. I love you,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>Falk\u2019s look of joy took Elise\u2019s breath away. His eyes went soft, and his lips crept into a roguish grin as he traced Elise\u2019s jaw with his fingertips. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said, his lips brushing her forehead.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me yet. We have to tell Father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Steffen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Rune. That one I will have to take care of, alone. You cannot rub this in his face.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou forget, Sweetness, out of all my brothers I am the one most likely to empathize with him,\u201d Falk said before laying another kiss on Elise.</p><p>This was never a future Elise had considered, and in some ways it was exactly what Elise expected. She would marry a member of nobility who was highly influential in a government department. Working jointly, they could take their departments to new heights. But even in her most fanciful dreams, Elise never thought her husband would love her as deeply as Falk did. She never imagined kisses as passionate and tingling as the ones Falk gave her. She never dreamed she would love her husband with a matching passion.</p><p>So no, it wasn\u2019t exactly what Elise had planned. It was a thousand times better.</p><p>For the first time in months, perhaps since the death of Queen Ingrid, Elise looked forward to the future.</p><p>When the new ambassador of Kozlovka took up his post in Arcainia, he complained to his predecessor. \u201cArcainia is a small country; why must we bow and scrape to them?\u201d</p><p>The previous ambassador lifted his eyes to the heavens. \u201cYou so closely resemble myself when I first arrived at the Arcainian court that it pains me. I will tell you what my predecessor told me: do our country a favor, and keep your mouth shut until you have a solid grasp of Arcainia\u2019s power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know plenty of Arcainia\u2019s power,\u201d the new ambassador protested.</p><p>\u201cYou are the second son of a duke who is known for being a rake. Forgive me for my doubts,\u201d the previous ambassador wryly said.</p> <p>The words stung the new ambassador of Kozlovka so much that he spent much of his first party in Arcainia sulking. \u201cI don\u2019t see what he\u2019s talking about,\u201d he muttered. \u201cThis court is a rag-tag spectacle. The royals are dressed no better than Mother\u2019s maid.\u201d</p><p>The country was pretty in an idealistic, cheerful song-bird sort of way. The ambassador of Kozlovka grudgingly admitted that the land was pretty and the subjects jolly, but the royals and the palace were a disgrace to behold. Why, the Crown Prince Steffen and his wife Princess Gabrielle were a handsome pair, dressed neatly in nice clothes, but there was no splendor. They did not drip with jewels or gold or expensive ornaments. The food was delicious but common, the castle was comfortable but not ornate. Even government employees were invited to the party, and they milled and conversed with Arcainian nobility without hesitation!</p><p>The ambassador of Kozlovka felt like he was visiting the estate of a country lord rather than a palace. \u201cDisgraceful,\u201d he muttered into his wine cup. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What surprised him was that an ambassador from every country on the continent was present. Not only were they attending, but many of them were acting oddly. The Loire ambassador was all smiles; the Sole representative laughed too loud, as if he was nervous; and the Verglas ambassador looked terrified.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d the ambassador of Kozlovka said when the Loire ambassador joined him in the corner he sulked in. \u201cWhy do you bow to these royals? Surely your own estates are more luxurious than this,\u201d he said, his mouth twisting with disdain.</p><p>The Loire ambassador blinked. \u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>The ambassador of Kozlovka gestured to the pretty but plain ballroom. \u201cThis place is not at all grand. It\u2019s a small, backwater country worth little or no notice. Why do you play attendant to the royals?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI hope that they will give a favorable report to the Black Court, of course,\u201d the Loire ambassador said.</p><p>\u201cThe what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know what?\u201d</p><p>The Loire ambassador shook his head. \u201cI do this because our countries have been allies for some time. This way,\u201d he said, plunging into the crowds.</p> <p>The ambassador of Kozlovka followed the Loire ambassador through the crowds, until they reached the far side of the room. \u201cThere,\u201d the Loire ambassador said.</p><p>The corner of the room was occupied by Prince Falk, the head of the Agriculture Department, and his wife of one year, Princess Elise, the chief of the Treasury Department. Prince Falk was the second youngest of the seven princes of Arcainia. Princess Elise was more widely known for the fact that she possessed a natural magic. It had been considered \u2018Shocking News\u2019 at the time of their marriage, but the ambassador of Kozlovka hadn\u2019t taken much note of it as the \u2018Shocking News\u2019 came from a small, unimportant country.</p><p>\u201cThat is Prince Falk and Princess Elise\u2014what of them?\u201d the ambassador of Kozlovka asked as he watched the pair.</p><p>Attendants danced around the prince and princess, and courtiers and ambassadors vied for the pair\u2019s attention. The royal couple seemed utterly entranced with each other, though, exchanging smiles and sharing quiet laughter.</p><p>\u201cThey are the Black Court,\u201d the Loire ambassador said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPrince Falk manages Arcainia\u2019s agriculture industry which, in spite of being one of the smallest countries on the continent, is the largest exporter of crops and foods. Princess Elise manages the country\u2019s purse strings. Not a coin enters or leaves the country without her knowledge. Being that they export everything from fish to crops to meat, and they are one of the few countries that can grow winter crops like radishes, carrots, and winter wheat, as a result their trading business is booming. Every continent on the country has some sort of dealings with them, whether it be agricultural or financial,\u201d the Loire ambassador said. \u201cIf you anger one of them, you will find your country cut off from their exports, trade routes, and treasury services. If you make a good impression on them, they will be merciful to your country and keep prices low even though they have a monopoly on a large amount of goods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat cannot be. If they are so powerful, the country must be rich. Why, then, is everything so plain?\u201d The ambassador of Kozlovka said.</p><p>The Loire ambassador shrugged. \u201cTo save money, Princess Elise imposes strict rules on the family\u2019s conduct. They don\u2019t seem to mind; they would rather hoard or invest their wealth than live in luxury, or so Princess Elise said.\u201d</p><p>The ambassador of Kozlovka stared at the royal pair.</p><p>Prince Falk said something and kissed Princess Elise\u2019s forehead, drawing a blush from the curly-haired princess.</p><p>\u201cPrince Steffen will one day become King, and Princess Gabrielle the Queen, but it\u2019s these two who run the majority of trade. They are the merchant monarchs of the continent,\u201d the Loire ambassador said.</p><p>\u201cAunt Elise!\u201d a gold-haired toddler shrieked as she skirted through the crowd around Prince Falk and Princess Elise. \u201cHide,\u201d the toddler said, diving behind Elise\u2019s skirts.</p><p>Seconds later, Prince Rune strolled past. \u201cHmm, I thought I saw her go this way. Where is she? Oh Princess Ria, where are you?\u201d Prince Rune asked, winking at Princess Elise as he crept closer to her.</p> <p>Those surrounding Prince Falk and Princess Elise backed up to watch the family spectacle.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Rune. I haven\u2019t seen her,\u201d Princess Elise said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too bad. I should move on, unless she\u2019s here,\u201d Prince Rune said, darting around Princess Elise to scoop up the giggling toddler.</p><p>The princess shrieked as Prince Rune tickled her tummy.</p><p>\u201cPracticing for the future?\u201d Prince Falk asked, his hand resting on his wife\u2019s waist. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPerhaps, although my wife isn\u2019t due for a few more months and I hope\u2014ouch\u2014our child is not so conniving,\u201d Rune said, wrenching the toddler from him to make her release her grip his hair. \u201cThere you go, Ria. Go find your mother,\u201d he said, setting her back down.</p><p>The crowd completely dispersed with the little girl\u2019s departure, but the ambassador of Kozlovka couldn\u2019t look away. It was astounding to him that a royal family so, so normal would be the financial power of the continent. He barely noticed when the Loire ambassador slapped him on the back and moved on.</p><p>\u201cAs her father is Steffen and her mother is Gabrielle, Ria was statistically doomed to have a shrewd personality,\u201d Prince Falk said. \u201cThat being explained, you should probably begin to worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFalk,\u201d Princess Elise said, smacking her husband in the belly.</p> <p>Prince Rune laughed good-naturedly. \u201cAnd what of you two? Think you\u2019ll be ready to unleash a child with your combined intelligence on the world?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Prince Falk said. \u201cBut we won\u2019t, yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Prince Rune asked.</p><p>\u201cAll our investments are not at a point where I could think about being absent from work,\u201d Princess Elise said. \u201cCarabas Harbor has been operational only for four years, and I mean to expand our wool industry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s rather auspicious,\u201d Prince Rune said.</p> <p>\u201cI will not rest until all acknowledge Arcainia\u2019s financial superiority,\u201d Princess Elise said with a maniacal laugh, flexing her fingers as she grinned like a hungry wolf at the dancers and party attendees. She abruptly cut the expression short. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen Brida yet tonight. I\u2019m off to find her. You two enjoy yourselves,\u201d Princess Elise said, kissing Prince Falk on the cheek before she swirled away.</p><p>Prince Rune squinted as he watched her leave. \u201cSometimes she frightens me.\u201d</p><p>Prince Falk sighed like a lovesick school boy. \u201cI just love that side of her.\u201d</p><p>Prince Rune eyed his brother. \u201cAllow me to amend that. Sometimes you both frighten me.\u201d</p><p>Prince Falk shrugged, and his eyes landed on the hapless ambassador of Kozlovka. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d he imperiously asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d the ambassador of Kozlovka said, swallowing.</p> <p>\u201cHumph,\u201d Prince Falk said before turning his attention back to his brother. \u201cElise received another letter from Prince Severin of Loire today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t their exchanges bother you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. I\u2019ve met his wife. Prince Severin isn\u2019t the type to stray, but if he did, she would butcher him. Anyway, he\u2019s wondering if he could send a few scholars to apprentice with Elise for a year or two.\u201d</p><p>As the princes drifted away, the ambassador of Kozlovka could no longer hear the conversation. He took the moment of silence to reconsider his thoughts on the royal family of Arcainia. He knew they were involved in the Shimmer Conflict, but every royal family on the continent was. Going beyond that knowledge he knew they were one of the countries that were struck first by a rogue magic user.</p><p>He always thought it was sheer luck that had freed their country, but after witnessing the family interactions and name dropping for even a few minutes, it was abundantly clear to the ambassador of Kozlovka that Princess Elise and the royal family of Arcainia could handle any problem cast on their country.</p><p>Rune</p><p>Everything was burning.</p><p>Elise\u2019s world was a wash of flames and heat. She wanted to cry out, she wanted to scream and howl in pain. But she couldn\u2019t.</p> <p>Clotilde was there, her death screams mixing with the roar of the hungry flames. Elise shut her eyes against the horrors, but she could feel the queen\u2019s papery skin under her hand as the witch expired, turned to dust by Elise\u2019s power.</p><p>Soon Elise would join the queen, turned to ash by the blistering flames.</p><p>Elise bolted upright, gasping for air and pushing her wild curls out of her face. \u201cIt was only a dream,\u201d Elise said to her silent room. \u201cI\u2019m not in Verglas, about to be burned. I\u2019m in Castle Brandis, in my room,\u201d she said, her voice an audible reminder.</p><p>Elise shivered and burrowed back under her blankets, chilled by more than the cool air.</p><p>Besides the marked change in her relationship with her foster brothers, Elise\u2019s curse-breaking-witch-slaying adventures added another aspect to her life: nightmares.</p><p>Elise knew Clotilde was evil, and she doubted anything but death would have ended her reign of terror, but the one-time queen\u2019s screams and the feel of ending her life haunted Elise in her sleeping hours.</p><p>Just as bad were the nightmares of fire and burning. Between the two memories, Elise found it difficult to sleep to say the least.</p><p>Elise closed her eyes only to be assaulted by the sight of King Torgen\u2019s mad, feverish eyes. His twisted laughter rang in her ears. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With a gasp Elise sat upright again. By the dying light of the fire, she pulled on a freshly laundered skirt over her nightclothes, and a thick robe. She slipped out of her room, taking care to shut the door without making a noise. Her room was surrounded by her brothers\u2019 quarters; if they knew she was up, they would fuss.</p><p>Elise wrapped the robe tighter and made her way to the kitchens. Even at this late\u2014or early\u2014hour, a cook or two was sure to be up marinating meat or punching dough for breakfast. If she couldn\u2019t sleep, Elise would rather be in the cheerful, warm kitchen.</p><p>Elise was almost there when a familiar voice stopped her.</p><p>\u201cElise?\u201d Rune said. He was dusty; his hair was mussed, and he had a fresh cut on his cheek. He was carrying a crossbow and quiver, but at the moment he looked concerned.</p> <p>\u201cRune, welcome home. You\u2019re back sooner than expected,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cI finished my dealings with the goblins during the morning and decided to push to come home rather than camp another night. What is wrong?\u201d Rune asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing. I couldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d Elise said, smiling to cover her partial truth.</p><p>Rune set the crossbow and quiver down so he could shed his traveling cloak. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t seem like you,\u201d he said, brushing off the black \u201chero\u201d clothes he wore beneath the cape. Covered as they were, they were mostly spared from dust and debris.</p><p>Elise shrugged. \u201cI thought a snack might help,\u201d Elise said, glancing in the direction of the kitchens, although the thought of food made her green.</p> <p>Rune studied her in uncomfortable silence. \u201cElise,\u201d he finally said. \u201cYou did the right thing. There was no other option; Clotilde had to be killed.\u201d</p><p>Elise winced, as though the words were a physical blow. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have had to kill before as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes the memory ever go away?\u201d Elise asked, staring at the hemline of her robe.</p><p>\u201cNot entirely, no. It fades, but you will always remember. It\u2019s a good thing.\u201d</p><p>Elise looked up, confused. \u201cWhat? How?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt reminds you how precious life is, and it teaches you to be merciful,\u201d Rune said, bridging the gap between them. \u201cBut Elise, while the memory will stay with you, you cannot let your guilt condemn you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I killed her,\u201d Elise shivered. \u201cClotilde was a person, and I killed her.\u201d</p><p>Rune eased his arms around Elise and pulled her flush against his chest. She hid her face in his shoulder, letting hot tears spill down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cShe was. Clotilde was human like you and I, but she made bad choices. She embraced darkness, and looked to make others suffer for her ambitions. The only way to stop her rampage was to kill her; it was the consequence of her actions. I am sorry you were forced to pay the price for even a part of her sins. Your actions were just, and you must accept and realize that, or she will win even in her death,\u201d Rune said, smoothing Elise\u2019s hair away from her face.</p><p>Elise said nothing, but took comfort in Rune\u2019s strength.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d Rune said after several moments, stepping back from Elise.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo Mother\u2019s Salon,\u201d Rune said, leading the way.</p> <p>The royal quarters of Castle Brandis were not by any means opulent. Besides their bedrooms, the royal family had few private rooms. One of the rare exceptions was a sitting room that was once upon a time used almost exclusively by Queen Ingrid for entertaining guests. It was now used mostly for family meetings as it was one of the few places that was not on office that could seat the family.</p><p>Rune grabbed a torch from the wall and entered the salon, pausing to start a fire in the fireplace and to light several candles. When the room was adequately lit, Rune returned the torch to the hallway. \u201cSit,\u201d he said, indicating to a plush settee.</p><p>After Elise sat, Rune eased in next to her, curling an arm around her shoulders. \u201cSo, you\u2019re having nightmares?\u201d</p><p>Elise nodded.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not unusual. I\u2019ve had the occasional nightmare since we returned,\u201d Rune said, rubbing his eyes with his free hand.</p><p>\u201cOf what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, in the fire.\u201d</p><p>Elise shivered and rested her head on Rune\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cMy heart stopped when I turned human and realized you were among the flames,\u201d Rune said, squeezing her shoulder. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been so terrified.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, either,\u201d Elise admitted, adjusting her head so it was pressed against Rune\u2019s chest rather than his shoulder. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if the shirts worked and the curse was really broken, or if you all were still swans. Thank you for saving me.\u201d</p><p>Rune dropped a kiss on Elise\u2019s head, making her blush to the roots of her hair. \u201cAs long as I live, I will do everything in my power to rescue you\u2014whether it be from mad kings or the mundane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am wild for you, Elise.\u201d Rune brushed Elise\u2019s shoulder with his fingertips. \u201cI love you. This may not be the right time to mention it, and Steffen would gut me if he knew, but I don\u2019t know when I will get another chance to tell you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When Elise was silent, Rune persisted, \u201cDo you still doubt me? Can\u2019t you see my love in my actions for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Elise said. Even when on the run from a black witch, Rune had proven that his first concern was Elise in a million different ways. Furthermore, it wasn\u2019t just her physical wellbeing that concerned him, but her emotional state as well. Rune could tell when she was upset, like tonight, and he knew exactly what to say. But... \u201cBut you never treated me like a lady. You flirt and charm women everywhere you go. You have never flirted with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Rune agreed. \u201cBecause I wanted to make it clear to you that I was not playing with you. I\u2019m not blind. I do not lead women on\u2014why do you think I call Brida Captain Meier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe liked you?\u201d Elise squawked.</p> <p>\u201cI picked up on it fairly quickly after it became apparent she had few feelings of kindness for you. Did you ever wonder why that was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I assumed it was because my status as a fosterling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrida is a fair girl. She wouldn\u2019t dislike you because of that. No, she disliked you because of the way I treat you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how do you treat me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe way a hero treats his lady love.\u201d</p> <p>Elise whipped her head off Rune\u2019s chest to stare at him. His face was smooth with its seriousness.</p><p>\u201cWho else do I offer to rescue and help at any time of the day? What other woman will I go charging across Arcainia for? What female besides you do I kiss\u2014not even on the lips but on the hand and head? I escort no one to parties or dinners because I will not partner myself with anyone who is not you.\u201d</p><p>Elise stared at the fire. If she looked at Rune, she would bolt. The passion of his feelings both thrilled and frightened her. \u201cWho am I to evoke such emotions in you? You are a hero. I\u2019m nothing but an orphan\u2014,\u201d</p><p>Before she could say more, Rune pressed a finger against her lips. \u201cNo, you are F\u00fcrstin Elise, financial genius, savior of Arcainia, brave, loyal, and true. I chose you because of who you are, not your pedigree.</p><p>\u201cYou are so beautiful, and you don\u2019t know it\u2014or at least you don\u2019t believe it. And for the life of me, I will never understand why you continuously bind your glorious hair back,\u201d Rune said, burying his hand in her wild hair.</p><p>Elise closed her eyes and allowed herself to see the future she kept locked in the deepest part of her heart. More than marrying someone for the country, more than marrying someone who was a good person and kind, Elise wanted to marry someone who was passionate for her, and who would spend every day the rest of their lives proving that passion.</p> <p>Elise wanted to marry a hero.</p><p>Elise would be happy with Rune if she could let go of her fears and doubts and allow herself to love him. But, could she do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cElise,\u201d Rune whispered. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Before Elise could open her eyes, Rune kissed her. The kiss was very much like the heroic prince: true, controlled passion, and warm. This close to him, Elise could smell the outdoors and open road on him. Every part of her tingled, and Elise almost laughed.</p><p>Oh, yes. She could easily give in and let herself love Rune.</p><p>When Rune finally released her, Elise blinked to try and clear her head. \u201cWell. I don\u2019t think nightmares will be a problem for me tonight.\u201d</p><p>Rune chuckled until he processed what she said and broke it off. \u201cWait, does that...?\u201d</p><p>Elise avoided her eyes and felt her cheeks burn. \u201cI love you, too, Rune.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly.\u201d</p><p>Rune bolted to his feet and scooped Elise up, laughing as he twirled her in the air.</p><p>\u201cKeep it down. Our family is sleeping,\u201d Elise chided, or tried to. Rune\u2019s laughter was infectious, and soon, she was laughing as well.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. Let them wake up. You have made me the happiest of men,\u201d Rune said, still holding Elise aloft.</p><p>The salon door swung open, revealing Steffen in his robe. His hair stuck up at odd angles, and his face was squished like a troll\u2019s. \u201cRune, what are you doing to Elise?\u201d Steffen said, his voice calm.</p><p>\u201cElise said she loves me,\u201d Rune said as he set Elise on her feet.</p><p>\u201cHow wonderful for you. If that is the case, what are you two doing in a room together, this late at night, unchaperoned?\u201d Steffen said.</p><p>Elise and Rune exchanged guilty glances.</p><p>Steffen shuffled into the room and grabbed Rune by the collar of his shirt. \u201cI am going to leash you. You will not be unchained until after you two are married\u2014which won\u2019t be for many years\u2014as I cannot trust you not to paw my baby sister. Say goodnight, Rune,\u201d Steffen said, dragging Rune out of the room.</p><p>\u201cSteffen,\u201d Rune said, tripping along behind their older brother. He gave Elise, who followed in their wake, a wry smile.</p><p>Elise giggled and, unseen by Steffen, took Rune\u2019s hand and squeezed it. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in the morning,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Elise,\u201d Rune said, his eyes soft with the promise of love and happiness.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Rune,\u201d Elise said, scarcely less happy and full of love. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf you do not muzzle yourself, Rune, I will find a kennel for you,\u201d Steffen said.</p><p>Elise stifled another peal of laughter as she left the brothers and darted into her bedroom.</p><p>Clotilde\u2019s presence and King Torgen\u2019s games were a foul chapter of her life, but there was no reason to let them spoil the rest of her days.</p><p>One day, she and Rune would marry\u2014although Steffen was right, it would not be for a handful of years. Elise wanted to get the country back on its feet, its financial power restored, and Carabas harbor opened before she married. She had no doubts Rune wouldn\u2019t agree to the waiting\u2014he had patiently waited for years to tell her his feelings, after all.</p> <p>She would have to tell Falk. She didn\u2019t look forward to this, he would be hurt. However, Elise knew her antisocial foster-brother had a warm heart. He would learn to love another.</p><p>Elise had made her choice. Rune would be her true love from now until she died. The hero and the banker was something of an odd combination, but\u2014Elise realized with a start\u2014 perhaps she was a hero, too.</p><p>Either way, it didn\u2019t matter. Rune chose Elise, and Elise chose Rune. For the first time in months, perhaps since the death of Queen Ingrid, Elise looked forward to the future.</p><p>\u201cYou may tell Advisor Withold that I will certainly take his advice under consideration, but the return on investment of a merchant fleet hardly seems worth it when we can tax our country\u2019s imports and exports, saving us the expense of building and outfitting ships and stimulating our economy by investing in diverse merchants,\u201d Elise said as she marched down a hallway, scribes and couriers scrambling at her side.</p><p>\u201cB\u2014but Princess,\u201d the scribe protested.</p> <p>\u201cFurthermore, we have a Navy to complete. Three more ships are being built as we speak. It seems silly to build merchant ships when we already have a flotilla of boats,\u201d Elise frowned.</p><p>\u201cPrincess, your brother wishes to speak with you,\u201d a new courier said, jostling in the crowd.</p><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d Elise asked.</p><p>\u201cCrown Prince Steffen.\u201d</p><p>Elise sucked in air through clenched teeth. \u201cNo. No, that is too bad. Tell Steffen that no, I will not be the master of ceremonies for the anniversary celebration of Clotilde\u2019s defeat. It\u2019s tacky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the people, Princess, they long to honor you,\u201d the courier wheedled.</p> <p>\u201cThey can honor Captain Meier, or Gabrielle, or her cat. They did just as much as I did,\u201d Elise said, adjusting the red sash of her customary work uniform.</p><p>\u201cPrincess,\u201d the courier protested.</p><p>\u201cPrincess Elise,\u201d a young page boy shouted at the top of his lungs as he skidded into the hallway. \u201cPrincess Elise!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Elise asked, directing her gaze to the small boy. This shift of attention earned the young boy many glares from the scribes and couriers.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s home!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRune is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! He\u2019s just arrived at the stables.\u201d</p><p>The scribes and couriers groaned, knowing their lady well enough to predict what would happen next.</p> <p>\u201cThank you, Wulf,\u201d Elise said to the young boy as she lifted her skirts several inches off the ground. \u201cIf you will excuse me, ladies, gentlemen,\u201d Elise said before she, in a most undignified and certainly not Perfect Princess fashion, ran down the hallway.</p><p>Elise tore through the castle, dodging maids and footmen. She flung herself into an open air corridor and cut across the gardens, slipping through a gap in the hedge that walled the gardens in. She skidded into the castle grounds just as Rune left the stables. He was dusty and dirty from traveling and camping in the woods, but Elise never thought him more handsome.</p><p>\u201cRune!\u201d Elise said, throwing herself at him.</p><p>Rune, who was carrying several saddle bags, dropped his load and swept Elise up in a whirling bundle of skirts and laughter. He laid a solid kiss on Elise\u2019s lips that was so long, the servants in the area clapped and catcalled.</p><p>Elise hid her blushing face in Rune\u2019s shoulder as Rune laughed and held her close. \u201cI will never grow tired of returning home to you. It almost makes the separation worth it,\u201d Rune said, tugging the ribbon that held Elise\u2019s hair in a low ponytail until it released, spilling her wild curls about her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI am glad you are home,\u201d Elise said, recovering enough to smile.</p><p>Rune kissed the palm of her hand before he adjusted the beautiful engagement ring on her finger. \u201cAnd I am glad to be home. Only two months,\u201d he said before he threw the saddle bags over one arm and twined his free arm around Elise. \u201cAny trouble with the wedding plans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFalk has been crusading against the cook to convince us to serve pilaf at the banquet. He thinks we can hook the foreign guests on the taste and increase our rice exports,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>Rune sighed. \u201cI almost wish you hadn\u2019t introduced him to that little secretary minion of the Commerce Department. Since those two started courting he\u2019s been nagging me to crack down on monsters to create safer trade routes for food exports.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s more: Gabrielle\u2019s belly has exploded,\u201d Elise said.</p><p>\u201cI thought she wasn\u2019t due for three months?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is, but according to her, their baby has the same fat head as his father and is going to be quite large. She fears she will have to be wheeled down the aisle,\u201d Elise said as they entered the castle together.</p><p>\u201cWhat does Steffen have to say of that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot much. Gabrielle has banned him from speaking of their baby in her presence. Apparently he has been hovering, and she grows tired of it. Last time she hefted herself into a saddle for a horse ride, Steffen suggested it wouldn\u2019t be good for the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe threw Puss at him.\u201d</p><p>Rune winced. \u201cOuch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed. But I don\u2019t think he will question her activities again,\u201d Elise said, a mischievous grin twitching across her lips.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s probably\u2014my word, what is that?\u201d Rune asked, almost dropping his saddlebags again when they entered the portrait gallery. He stared at several giant monstrosities of art and embroidery. Hung on the walls were tapestries and life-sized paintings of Elise and Rune. Instead of being the typical portraits, each piece had Rune battling some kind of monster, usually wearing a gaudy set of armor or brandishing a shining sword, and Elise at his side, glowing and wielding magic like a top-notch enchantress.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Elise frowned. \u201cSteffen has decided since we are marrying, together we can be the perfect public relations image for our subjects to rally under. He means to portray us as some kind of heroic duo with you as the monster killer and me as a magic user. Since I killed Clotilde, our \u2018image\u2019 has reached new heights of admiration from the commoners. Steffen wants to make the most of our marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fitting,\u201d Rune said, looking at the various pieces of art. \u201cHe\u2019s gone all out, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just about killed him that we had to downplay my magic before the Shimmer Conflict,\u201d Elise wryly said.</p><p>This time Rune did drop his saddlebags again and pulled Elise into a close embrace. \u201cIt was to keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no longer something to worry about,\u201d Elise said, listening to the steady thud of Rune\u2019s heart.</p> <p>\u201cI cannot wait for our future together,\u201d Rune said, entwining his hands with Elise\u2019s before kissing her. \u201cI love you. I missed you,\u201d Rune said, resting his forehead against hers.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to live happily ever after,\u201d Rune said.</p><p>\u201cAs the Monster Killer and Magic Tamer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes I think our epic combination is the only reason Steffen agreed to our marriage,\u201d Rune said.</p><p>Elise chuckled and picked up one of Rune\u2019s saddlebags. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what Steffen thinks. It\u2019s what we feel that makes the difference.\u201d</p><p>Rune gathered the rest of his saddle bags. \u201cTwo months. I cannot wait,\u201d he said, entangling his free hand in Elise\u2019s wild curls before leaning in to kiss her.</p><p>The kiss went on for several moments until a door to the portrait gallery opened.</p> <p>\u201cRune, you\u2019re home\u2014hey! You get your paws off my sister,\u201d Nick shouted from the far end of the room.</p><p>Rune ended the kiss, but leaned his forehead against Elise\u2019s and sighed. \u201cTwo months,\u201d he repeated in a long-suffering tone.</p><p>Elise giggled.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? Stop giggling. I said, what are you doing? Mikk! The love-birds are at it again; we\u2019ve got to stop Rune!\u201d Nick said before he ran at Elise and Rune like a mad bull.</p><p>\u201cI would like to see you try,\u201d Rune said, bracing for impact.</p><p>\u201cNo, let\u2019s run,\u201d Elise said, grabbing Rune by the arm and pulling him along.</p><p>\u201cStop! I\u2019ll tell Father you\u2019re eloping,\u201d Nick said as he tore after Rune and Elise.</p><p>Rune stopped running. \u201cThat\u2019s a great idea,\u201d he said, his face serious.</p><p>\u201cWhat? No! Mikk!\u201d Nick roared.</p><p>Elise almost tripped, she was laughing so hard as she and Rune fled the portrait gallery and ran.</p><p>Marrying her personal hero was a happily ever after Elise had never dared to hope for. Being fully embraced by the royal family\u2014for now she really would be her foster brothers\u2019 sister\u2014was a dream come true.</p><p>There was a chance a creature like Clotilde would surface again, but with her fierce husband and her wonderful family, Elise thought there was nothing they couldn\u2019t handle. </p> </body></html>"]
