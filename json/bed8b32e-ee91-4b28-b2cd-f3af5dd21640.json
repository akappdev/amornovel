My mother would call it extraneous, overblown, exuberant. To me, it was simply annoying, just like everything else about my stepmother, Heidi.</p> <p>I hope you\u2019re having a great last few weeks of classes. We are all good here! Just finishing things up before your sister-to-be arrives. She\u2019s been kicking like crazy lately. It\u2019s like she\u2019s doing the karate moves in there! I\u2019ve been busy minding the store (so to speak) and putting the final touches on the nursery. I\u2019ve done it all in pink and brown; it\u2019s gorgeous. I\u2019ll attach a picture so you can see it.</p><p>Your dad is busy as always, working on his book. I figure I\u2019ll see more of him burning the midnight oil when I\u2019m up with the baby!</p><p>I really hope you\u2019ll consider coming to visit us once you\u2019re done with school. It would be so much fun, and make this summer that much more special for all of us. Just come anytime. We\u2019d love to see you!</p><p>Love,</p><p>Heidi (and your dad, and the baby-to-be!)</p> <p>Just reading these missives exhausted me. Partially it was the excited grammar \u2013 which was like someone yelling in your ear \u2013 but also just Heidi herself. She was just so... extraneous, overblown, exuberant. And annoying. All the things she\u2019d been to me, and more, since she and my dad got involved, pregnant, and married in the last year.</p><p>My mother claimed not to be surprised. Ever since the divorce, she\u2019d been predicting it would not be long before my dad, as she put it, \u2018shacked up with some coed\u2019. At twenty-six, Heidi was the same age my mother had been when she had my brother, Hollis, followed by me two years later, although they could not be more different. Where my mother was an academic scholar with a smart, sharp wit and a nationwide reputation as an expert on women\u2019s roles in Renaissance literature, Heidi was... well, Heidi. The kind of woman whose strengths were her constant self-maintenance (pedicures, manicures, hair highlights), knowing everything you never wanted to about hemlines and shoes, and sending entirely too chatty e-mails to people who couldn\u2019t care less.</p><p>Their courtship was quick, the implantation (as my mother christened it) happening within a couple of months. Just like that, my father went from what he\u2019d been for years \u2013 husband of Dr. Victoria West and author of one well-received novel, now more known for his interdepartmental feuds than his long-in-progress follow-up \u2013 to a new husband and father-to-be. Add all this to his also-new position as head of the creative writing department at Weymar College, a small school in a beachfront town, and it was like my dad had a whole new life. And even though they were always inviting me to come, I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to find out if there was still a place for me in it.</p><p>Now, from the other room, I heard a sudden burst of laughter, followed by some clinking of glasses. My mother was hosting another of her graduate student get-togethers, which always began as formal dinners (\u2018Culture is so lacking in this culture!\u2019 she said) before inevitably deteriorating into loud, drunken debates about literature and theory. I glanced at the clock \u2013 ten thirty \u2013 then eased my bedroom door open with my toe, glancing down the long hallway to the kitchen. Sure enough, I could see my mom sitting at the head of our big butcher-block kitchen table, a glass of red wine in one hand. Gathered around her, as usual, were a bunch of male graduate students, looking on adoringly as she went on about, from the little bit I could gather, Marlowe and the culture of women.</p><p>This was yet another of the many fascinating contradictions about my mom. She was an expert on women in literature but didn\u2019t much like them in practice. Partly, it was because so many of them were jealous: of her intelligence (practically Mensa level), her scholarship (four books, countless articles, one endowed chair), or her looks (tall and curvy with very long jet-black hair she usually wore loose and wild, the only out-of-control thing about her). For these reasons, and others, female students seldom came to these gatherings, and if they did, they rarely returned.</p><p>\u2018Dr. West,\u2019 one of the students \u2013 typically scruffy, in a cheap-looking blazer, shaggy hair, and hip-nerdy black eyeglasses \u2013 said now, \u2018you should really consider developing that idea into an article. It\u2019s fascinating.\u2019</p> <p>I watched my mother take a sip of her wine, pushing her hair back smoothly with one hand. \u2018Oh, God no,\u2019 she said, in her deep, raspy voice (she sounded like a smoker, although she\u2019d never taken a drag in her life). \u2018I barely even have time to write my book right now, and that, at least, I\u2019m getting paid for. If you can call it payment.\u2019</p><p>More complimentary laughter. My mother loved to complain about how little she got paid for her books \u2013 all academic, published by university presses \u2013 while what she termed \u2018inane housewife stories\u2019 pulled in big bucks. In my mother\u2019s world, everyone would tote the collected works of Shakespeare to the beach, with maybe a couple of epic poems thrown in on the side.</p><p>\u2018Still,\u2019 Nerdy Eyeglasses said, pushing on, \u2018it\u2019s a brilliant idea. I could, um, coauthor it with you, if you like.\u2019</p><p>My mother lifted her head and her glass, narrowing her eyes at him as a silence fell. \u2018Oh, my,\u2019 she said, \u2018how very sweet of you. But I don\u2019t do coauthorship, for the same reason I don\u2019t do office mates or relationships. I\u2019m just too selfish.\u2019</p><p>I could see Nerdy Eyeglasses gulp, even from my long vantage point, his face flushing as he reached for the wine bottle, trying to cover. Idiot, I thought, nudging the door back shut. As if it was that easy to align yourself with my mom, form some quick and tight bond that would last. I would know.</p><p>Ten minutes later, I was slipping out the side door, my shoes tucked under my arm, and getting into my car. I drove down the mostly empty streets, past quiet neighborhoods and dark storefronts, until the lights of Ray\u2019s Diner appeared in the distance. Small, with entirely too much neon, and tables that were always a bit sticky, Ray\u2019s was the only place in town open twenty-four hours, 365 days a year. Since I hadn\u2019t been sleeping, I\u2019d spent more nights than not in a booth there, reading or studying, tipping a buck every hour on whatever I ordered until the sun came up.</p><p>The insomnia started when my parents\u2019 marriage began to fall apart three years earlier. I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised: their union had been tumultuous for as long as I could remember, although they were usually arguing more about work than about each other. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They\u2019d originally come to the U straight out of grad school, when my dad was offered an assistant professorship there. At the time, he\u2019d just found a publisher for his first novel, The Narwhal Horn, while my mom was pregnant with my brother and trying to finish her dissertation. Fast-forward four years, to my birth, and my dad, riding a wave of critical and commercial success \u2013 NYT best-seller list, National Book Award nominee \u2013 was heading up the creative writing program, while my mom was, as she liked to put it, \u2018lost in a sea of diapers and self-doubt\u2019. When I entered kindergarten, though, my mom came back to academia with a vengeance, scoring a visiting lectureship and a publisher for her dissertation. Over time, she became one of the most popular professors in the department, was hired on for a full-time position, and banged out a second, then a third book, all while my father looked on. He claimed to be proud, always making jokes about her being his meal ticket, the breadwinner of the family. But then my mother got her endowed chair, which was very prestigious, and he got dropped from his publisher, which wasn\u2019t, and things started to get ugly.</p><p>The fights always seemed to begin over dinner, with one of them making some small remark and the other taking offense. There would be a small dustup \u2013 sharp words, a banged pot lid \u2013 but then it would seem resolved... at least until about ten or eleven, when suddenly I\u2019d hear them start in again about the same issue. After a while I figured out that this time lag occurred because they were waiting for me to fall asleep before really going at it. So I decided, one night, not to. I left my door open, my light on, took pointed, obvious trips to the bathroom, washing my hands as loudly as possible. And for a while, it worked. Until it didn\u2019t, and the fights started up again. But by then my body was used to staying up way late, which meant I was now awake for every single word.</p><p>I knew a lot of people whose parents had split up, and everyone seemed to handle it differently: complete surprise, crushing disappointment, total relief. The common denominator, though, was always that there was a lot of discussion about these feelings, either with both parents, or one on one separately, or with a shrink in group or individual therapy. My family, of course, had to be the exception. I did get the sit-down-we-have-to-tell-you-something moment. The news was delivered by my mother, across the kitchen table as my dad leaned against a nearby counter, fiddling with his hands and looking tired. \u2018Your father and I are separating,\u2019 she informed me, with the same flat, businesslike tone I\u2019d so often heard her use with students as she critiqued their work. \u2018I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll agree this is the best thing for all of us.\u2019</p><p>Hearing this, I wasn\u2019t sure what I felt. Not relief, not crushing disappointment, and again, it wasn\u2019t a surprise. What struck me, as we sat there, the three of us, in that room, was how little I felt. Small, like a child. Which was the weirdest thing. Like it took this huge moment for a sudden wave of childhood to wash over me, long overdue.</p> <p>I\u2019d been a child, of course. But by the time I came along, my brother \u2013 the most colicky of babies, a hyperactive toddler, a \u2018spirited\u2019 (read \u2018impossible\u2019) kid \u2013 had worn my parents out. He was still exhausting them, albeit from another continent, wandering around Europe and sending only the occasional e-mail detailing yet another epiphany concerning what he should do with his life, followed by a request for more money to put it into action. At least his being abroad made all this seem more nomadic and artistic: now my parents could tell their friends Hollis was hanging out at the Eiffel Tower smoking cigarettes, instead of at the Quik Zip. It just sounded better.</p><p>If Hollis was a big kid, I was the little adult, the child who, at three, would sit at the table during grown-up discussions about literature and color my coloring books, not making a peep. Who learned to entertain myself at a very early age, who was obsessive about school and grades from kindergarten, because academia was the one thing that always got my parents\u2019 attention. \u2018Oh, don\u2019t worry,\u2019 my mother would say, when one of their guests would slip with the F-word or something equally grown-up in front of me. \u2018Auden\u2019s very mature for her age.\u2019 And I was, whether that age was two or four or seventeen. While Hollis required constant supervision, I was the one who got carted everywhere, constantly flowing in my mom\u2019s or dad\u2019s wake. They took me to the symphony, art shows, academic conferences, committee meetings, where I was expected to be seen and not heard. There was not a lot of time for playing or toys, although I never wanted for books, which were always in ample supply.</p><p>Because of this upbringing, I had kind of a hard time relating to other kids my age. I didn\u2019t understand their craziness, their energy, the rambunctious way they tossed around couch cushions, say, or rode their bikes wildly around culs-de-sac. It did look sort of fun, but at the same time, it was so different from what I was used to that I couldn\u2019t imagine how I would ever partake if given the chance. Which I wasn\u2019t, as the cushion-tossers and wild bike riders didn\u2019t usually attend the highly academic, grade-accelerated private schools my parents favored.</p><p>In the past four years, in fact, I\u2019d switched schools three times. I\u2019d lasted at Jackson High for only a couple of weeks before my mom, having spotted a misspelling and a grammatical error on my English syllabus, moved me to Perkins Day, a local private school. It was smaller and more academically rigorous, although not nearly as much as Kiffney-Brown, the charter school to which I transferred in junior year. Founded by several former local professors, it was elite \u2013 a hundred students, max \u2013 and emphasized very small classes and a strong connection to the local university, where you could take college-level courses for early credit. While I had a few friends at Kiffney-Brown, the ultracompetitive atmosphere, paired with so much of the curriculum being self-guided, made getting close to them somewhat difficult.</p><p>Not that I really cared. School was my solace, and studying let me escape, allowing me to live a thousand vicarious lives. The more my parents bemoaned Hollis\u2019s lack of initiative and terrible grades, the harder I worked. And while they were proud of me, my accomplishments never seemed to get me what I really wanted. I was such a smart kid, I should have figured out that the only way to really get my parents\u2019 attention was to disappoint them or fail. But by the time I finally realized that, succeeding was already a habit too ingrained to break.</p> <p>My dad moved out at the beginning of my sophomore year, renting a furnished apartment right near campus in a complex mostly populated by students. I was supposed to spend every weekend there, but he was in such a funk \u2013 still struggling with his second book, his publication (or lack of it) called into question just as my mom\u2019s was getting so much attention \u2013 that it wasn\u2019t exactly enjoyable. Then again, my mom\u2019s house wasn\u2019t much better, as she was so busy celebrating her newfound single life and academic success that she had people over all the time, students coming and going, dinner parties every weekend. It seemed like there was no middle ground anywhere, except at Ray\u2019s Diner. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019d driven past it a million times but had never thought of stopping until one night when I was heading back to my mom\u2019s around two A.M. My dad, like my mom, didn\u2019t really keep close tabs on me. Because of my school schedule \u2013 one night class, flexible daytime seminar hours, and several independent studies \u2013 I came and went as I pleased, with little or no questioning, so neither of them really noticed that I wasn\u2019t sleeping. That night, I glanced in at Ray\u2019s, and something about it just struck me. It looked warm, safe almost, populated by people who at least I had one thing in common with. So I pulled in, went inside, and ordered a cup of coffee and some apple pie. I stayed until sunrise.</p><p>The nice thing about Ray\u2019s was that even once I became a regular, I still got to be alone. Nobody was asking for more than I wanted to give, and all the interactions were short and sweet. If only all relationships could be so simple, with me always knowing my role exactly.</p><p>Back in the fall, one of the waitresses, a heavyset older woman whose name tag said JULIE, had peered down at the application I was working on as she refilled my coffee cup.</p><p>\u2018Defriese University,\u2019 she read out loud. Then she looked at me. \u2018Pretty good school.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018One of the best,\u2019 I agreed.</p><p>\u2018Think you\u2019ll get in?\u2019</p><p>I nodded. \u2018Yeah. I do.\u2019</p><p>She smiled, like I was kind of cute, then patted my shoulder. \u2018Ah, to be young and confident,\u2019 she said, and then she was shuffling away.</p><p>I wanted to tell her that I wasn\u2019t confident, I just worked really hard. But she had already moved on to the next booth, chatting up the guy sitting there, and I knew she didn\u2019t really care anyway. There were worlds where all of this \u2013 grades, school, papers, class rank, early admission, weighted GPAs \u2013 mattered, and ones where they didn\u2019t. I\u2019d spent my entire life squarely in the former, and even at Ray\u2019s, which was the latter, I still couldn\u2019t shake it.</p> <p>Being so driven, and attending such an unorthodox school, meant that I\u2019d missed out on making all those senior moments that my old friends from Perkins Day had spent this whole last year talking about. The only thing I\u2019d even considered was prom, and then only because my main competition for highest GPA, Jason Talbot, had asked me as a sort of peace offering. In the end, though, even that hadn\u2019t happened, as he canceled last minute after getting invited to participate in some ecology conference. I told myself it didn\u2019t matter, that it was the equivalent of those couch cushions and cul-de-sac bike rides all those years ago, frivolous and unnecessary. But I still kind of wondered, that night and so many others, what I was missing.</p><p>I\u2019d be sitting at Ray\u2019s, at two or three or four in the morning, and feel this weird twinge. When I looked up from my books to the people around me \u2013 truckers, people who\u2019d come off the interstate for coffee to make another mile, the occasional crazy \u2013 I\u2019d have that same feeling that I did the day my mother announced the separation. Like I didn\u2019t belong there, and should have been at home, asleep in my bed, like everyone else I\u2019d see at school in a few hours. But just as quickly, it would pass, everything settling back into place around me. And when Julie came back around with her coffeepot, I\u2019d push my cup to the edge of the table, saying without words what we both knew well \u2013 that I\u2019d be staying for a while.</p><p>My stepsister, Thisbe Caroline West, was born the day before my graduation, weighing in at six pounds, fifteen ounces. My father called the next morning, exhausted.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m so sorry, Auden,\u2019 he said, \u2018I hate to miss your speech.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s all right,\u2019 I told him as my mother came into the kitchen, in her robe, and headed for the coffeemaker. \u2018How\u2019s Heidi?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Good,\u2019 he replied. \u2018Tired. It was a long haul, and she ended up having a caesarean, which she wasn\u2019t so happy about. But I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll feel better after she gets some rest.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Tell her I said congratulations,\u2019 I told him.</p><p>\u2018I will. And you go out there and give \u2019em hell, kid.\u2019 This was typical: for my dad, who was famously combative, anything relating to academia was a battle. \u2018I\u2019ll be thinking about you.\u2019</p><p>I smiled, thanked him, then hung up the phone as my mother poured milk into her coffee. She stirred her cup, the spoon clanking softly, for a moment before saying, \u2018Let me guess. He\u2019s not coming.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Heidi had the baby,\u2019 I said. \u2018They named her Thisbe.\u2019</p><p>My mother snorted. \u2018Oh, good Lord,\u2019 she said. \u2018All the names from Shakespeare to choose from, and your father picks that one? The poor girl. She\u2019ll be having to explain herself her entire life.\u2019</p><p>My mom didn\u2019t really have room to talk, considering she\u2019d let my dad name me and my brother: Detram Hollis was a professor my dad greatly admired, while W. H. Auden was his favorite poet. I\u2019d spent some time as a kid wishing my name were Ashley or Katherine, if only because it would have made life simpler, but my mom liked to tell me that my name was actually a kind of litmus test. Auden wasn\u2019t like Frost, she\u2019d say, or Whitman. He was a bit more obscure, and if someone knew of him, then I could be at least somewhat sure they were worth my time and energy, capable of being my intellectual equal. I figured this might be even more true for Thisbe, but instead of saying so I just sat down with my speech notes, flipping through them again. After a moment, she pulled out a chair, joining me.</p><p>\u2018So Heidi survived the childbirth, I assume?\u2019 she asked, taking a sip off her coffee.</p><p>\u2018She had to have a caesarean.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018She\u2019s lucky,\u2019 my mom said. \u2018Hollis was eleven pounds, and the epidural didn\u2019t take. He almost killed me.\u2019</p><p>I flipped through another couple of cards, waiting for one of the stories that inevitably followed this one. There was how Hollis was a ravenous child, sucking my mother\u2019s milk supply dry. The craziness that was his colic, how he had to be walked constantly and, even then, screamed for hours on end. Or there was the one about my dad, and how he...</p><p>\u2018I just hope she\u2019s not expecting your father to be of much help,\u2019 she said, reaching over for a couple of my cards and scanning them, her eyes narrowed. \u2018I was lucky if he changed a diaper every once in a while. And forget about him getting up for night feedings. He claimed that he had sleep issues and had to get his nine hours in order to teach. Awfully convenient, that.\u2019</p><p>She was still reading my cards as she said this, and I felt the familiar twinge I always experienced whenever anything I did was suddenly under her scrutiny. A moment later, though, she put them aside without comment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Well,\u2019 I said as she took another sip of coffee, \u2018that was a long time ago. Maybe he\u2019s changed.\u2019</p><p>\u2018People don\u2019t change. If anything, you get more set in your ways as you get older, not less.\u2019 She shook her head. \u2018I remember I used to sit in our bedroom, with Hollis screaming, and just wish that once the door would open, and your father would come in and say, \u201cHere, give him to me. You go rest.\u201d Eventually, it wasn\u2019t even your dad I wanted, just anybody. Anybody at all.\u2019</p><p>She was looking out the window as she said this, her fingers wrapped around her mug, which was not on the table or at her lips but instead hovering just between. I picked up my cards, carefully arranging them back in order. \u2018I should go get ready,\u2019 I said, pushing my chair back.</p><p>My mother didn\u2019t move as I got up and walked behind her. It was like she was frozen, still back in that old bedroom, still waiting, at least until I got down the hallway. Then, suddenly, she spoke.</p> <p>\u2018You should rethink that Faulkner quote,\u2019 she said. \u2018It\u2019s too much for an opening. You\u2019ll sound pretentious.\u2019</p><p>I looked down at my top card, where the words \u2018The past isn\u2019t dead. It isn\u2019t even past\u2019 were written in my neat block print. \u2018Okay,\u2019 I said. She was right, of course. She always was. \u2018Thanks.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019d been so focused on my last year of high school and beginning college that I hadn\u2019t really thought about the time in between. Suddenly, though, it was summer, and there was nothing to do but wait for my real life to begin again.</p><p>I spent a couple of weeks getting all the stuff I needed for Defriese, and tried to pick up a few shifts at my tutoring job at Huntsinger Test Prep, although it was pretty slow. I seemed to be the only one thinking about school, a fact made more obvious by the various invitations I received from my old friends at Perkins to dinners or trips to the lake. I wanted to see everyone, but whenever we did get together, I felt like the odd person out. I\u2019d only been at Kiffney-Brown for two years, but it was so different, so entirely academic, that I found I couldn\u2019t really relate to their talk about summer jobs and boyfriends. After a few awkward outings, I began to beg off, saying I was busy, and after a while, they got the message.</p><p>Home was kind of weird as well, as my mom had gotten some research grant and was working all the time, and when she wasn\u2019t, her graduate assistants were always showing up for impromptu dinners and cocktail hours. When they got too noisy and the house too crowded, I\u2019d head out to the front porch with a book and read until it was dark enough to go to Ray\u2019s.</p> <p>One night, I was deeply into a book about Buddhism when I saw a green Mercedes coming down our street. It slowed as it neared our mailbox, then slid to a stop by the curb. After a moment, a very pretty blonde girl wearing low-slung jeans, a red tank top, and wedge sandals got out, a package in one hand. She peered at the house, then down at the package, then back at the house again before starting up the driveway. She was almost to the front steps when she saw me.</p><p>\u2018Hi!\u2019 she called out, entirely friendly, which was sort of alarming. I barely had time to respond before she was heading right to me, a big smile on her face. \u2018You must be Auden.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 I said slowly.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m Tara!\u2019 Clearly, this name was supposed to be familiar to me. When it became obvious it wasn\u2019t, she added, \u2018Hollis\u2019s girlfriend?\u2019</p><p>Oh, dear, I thought. Out loud I said, \u2018Oh, right. Of course.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s so nice to meet you!\u2019 she said, moving closer and putting her arms around me. She smelled like gardenias and dryer sheets. \u2018Hollis knew I\u2019d be passing through on my way home, and he asked me to bring you this. Straight from Greece!\u2019</p> <p>She handed over the package, which was in a plain brown wrapper, my name and address written across the front in my brother\u2019s slanted, sloppy hand. There was an awkward moment, during which I realized she was waiting for me to open the package, so I did. It was a small glass picture frame, dotted with colorful stones: along the bottom were etched the words THE BEST OF TIMES. Inside was a picture of Hollis standing in front of the Taj Mahal. He was smiling one of his lazy smiles, in cargo shorts and a T-shirt, a backpack over one shoulder.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s great, right?\u2019 Tara said. \u2018We got it at a flea market in Athens.\u2019</p><p>Since I couldn\u2019t say what I really felt, which was that you had to be a pretty serious narcissist to give a picture of yourself as a gift, I told her, \u2018It\u2019s beautiful.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I knew you\u2019d like it!\u2019 She clapped her hands. \u2018I told him, everyone needs picture frames. They make a memory even more special, you know?\u2019</p><p>I looked down at the frame again, the pretty stones, my brother\u2019s easy expression. THE BEST OF TIMES, indeed. \u2018Yeah,\u2019 I said. \u2018Absolutely.\u2019</p><p>Tara shot me another million-watt smile, then peered through the window behind me. \u2018So is your mom around? I would love to meet her. Hollis adores her, talks about her all the time.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s mutual,\u2019 I said. She glanced at me, and I smiled. \u2018She\u2019s in the kitchen. Long black hair, in the green dress. You can\u2019t miss her.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Great!\u2019 Too quick to prevent, she was hugging me again. \u2018Thanks so much.\u2019</p> <p>I nodded. This confidence was a hallmark of all my brother\u2019s girlfriends, at least while they still considered themselves as such. It was only later, when the e-mails and calls stopped, when he seemingly vanished off the face of the earth, that we saw the other side: the red eyes, the weepy messages on our answering machine, the occasional angry peel-out on the road outside our house. Tara didn\u2019t seem like the angry drive-by type. But you never knew.</p><p>By eleven, my mother\u2019s admirers were still hanging around, their voices loud as always. I sat in my room, idly checking my Ume.com page (no messages, not that I\u2019d expected any) and e-mail (just one from my dad, asking how everything was going). I thought about calling one of my friends to see if anything was going on, but after remembering the awkwardness of my last few social outings, I sat down on my bed instead. Hollis\u2019s picture frame was on the bedside table, and I picked it up, looking over the tacky blue stones. THE BEST OF TIMES. Something in these words, and his easy, smiling face, reminded me of the chatter of my old friends as they traded stories from the school year. Not about classes, or GPAs, but other stuff, things that were as foreign to me as the Taj Mahal itself, gossip and boys and getting your heart broken. They probably had a million pictures that belonged in this frame, but I didn\u2019t have a single one. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I looked at my brother again, backpack over his shoulder. Travel certainly did provide some kind of opportunity, as well as a change of scenery. Maybe I couldn\u2019t take off to Greece or India. But I could still go somewhere.</p><p>I went over to my laptop, opening my e-mail account, then scrolled down to my dad\u2019s message. Without letting myself think too much, I typed a quick reply, as well as a question. Within a half hour, he had written me back.</p><p>Absolutely you should come! Stay as long as you like. We\u2019d love the company!</p><p>And just like that, my summer changed.</p> <p>The next morning, I packed my car with a small duffel bag of clothes, my laptop, and a big suitcase of books. Earlier in the summer, I\u2019d found the syllabi to a couple of the courses I was taking at Defriese in the fall, and I\u2019d hunted down a few of the texts at the U bookstore, figuring it couldn\u2019t hurt to acquaint myself with the material. Not exactly how Hollis would pack, but it wasn\u2019t like there\u2019d be much else to do there anyway, other than go to the beach and hang out with Heidi, neither of which was very appealing.</p><p>I\u2019d said good-bye to my mom the night before, figuring she\u2019d be asleep when I left. But as I came into the kitchen, I found her clearing the table of a bevy of wineglasses and crumpled napkins, a tired look on her face.</p><p>\u2018Late night?\u2019 I asked, although I knew from my own nocturnal habits that it had been. The last car had pulled out of the driveway around one thirty.</p><p>\u2018Not really,\u2019 she said, running some water into the sink. She looked over her shoulder at my bags, piled by the garage door. \u2018You\u2019re getting an early start. Are you that eager to get away from me?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 I said. \u2018Just want to beat traffic.\u2019</p> <p>In truth, I hadn\u2019t expected my mom to care whether I was around for the summer or not. And maybe she wouldn\u2019t have, if I\u2019d been going anywhere else. Factor my dad into the equation, though, and things changed. They always did.</p><p>\u2018I can only imagine what kind of situation you\u2019re about to walk into,\u2019 she said, smiling. \u2018Your father with a newborn! At his age! It\u2019s comic.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll let you know,\u2019 I told her.</p><p>\u2018Oh, you must. I will require regular updates.\u2019</p><p>I watched as she stuck her hands into the water, soaping up a glass. \u2018So,\u2019 I said, \u2018what did you think of Hollis\u2019s girlfriend?\u2019</p><p>My mother sighed wearily. \u2018What was she doing here, again?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Hollis sent her back with a gift for me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Really,\u2019 she said, depositing a couple of glasses into the dish rack. \u2018What was it?\u2019</p><p>\u2018A picture frame. From Greece. With a picture of Hollis in it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Ah.\u2019 She turned off the water, using the back of her wrist to brush her hair from her face. \u2018Did you tell her she should have kept it for herself, since it\u2019s probably the only way she\u2019ll ever see him again?\u2019</p><p>Even though I\u2019d had this exact same thought, after hearing my mom say it aloud I felt sorry for Tara, with her open, friendly face, the confident way she\u2019d headed into the house, so secure in her standing as Hollis\u2019s one and only. \u2018You never know,\u2019 I said. \u2018Maybe Hollis has changed, and they\u2019ll get engaged.\u2019</p><p>My mom turned around and narrowed her eyes at me. \u2018Now, Auden,\u2019 she said. \u2018What have I told you about people changing?\u2019</p><p>\u2018That they don\u2019t?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Exactly.\u2019</p> <p>She directed her attention back to the sink, dunking a plate, and as she did I caught sight of the pair of black, hipnerdy eyeglasses sitting on the counter by the door. Suddenly, it all made sense: the voices I\u2019d heard so late, her being up early, uncharacteristically eager to clean out everything from the night before. I considered picking the glasses up, making sure she saw me, just to make a point of my own. But instead, I ignored them as we said our goodbyes, her pulling me in for a tight hug \u2013 she always held you close, like she\u2019d never let you go \u2013 before doing just that and sending me on my way.</p><p>Chapter TWO</p><p>My dad and Heidi\u2019s house was just what I expected. Cute, painted white with green shutters, it had a wide front porch dotted with rocking chairs and potted flowers and a friendly yellow ceramic pineapple hanging from the door, that said WELCOME! All that was missing was a white picket fence.</p><p>I pulled in, spotting my dad\u2019s beat-up Volvo in the open garage, with a newer-looking Prius parked beside it. As soon as I cut my engine I could hear the ocean, loud enough that it had to be very close. Sure enough, as I peered around the side of the house, all I could see was beach grass and a wide swath of blue, stretching all the way to the horizon.</p><p>The view aside, I had my doubts. I was never one for spontaneity, and the farther I got from my mom\u2019s house, the more I started to consider the reality of a full summer of Heidi. Would there be group manicures for me, her, and the baby? Or maybe she\u2019d insist I go tanning with her, sporting matching retro I LOVE UNICORNS tees? But I kept thinking of Hollis in front of the Taj Mahal, and how I\u2019d found myself so bored all alone at home. Plus, I\u2019d hardly seen my dad since he got married, and this \u2013 eight full weeks when he wasn\u2019t teaching, and I wasn\u2019t in school \u2013 seemed like my last chance to catch up with him before college, and real life, began.</p><p>I took a deep breath, then got out. As I started up to the front porch, I told myself that no matter what Heidi said or did, I would just smile and roll with it. At least until I could get to whatever room I\u2019d be staying in and shut the door behind me.</p><p>I rang the doorbell, then stepped back, arranging my face into an appropriately friendly expression. There was no response from inside, so I rang it again, then leaned in closer, listening for the inevitable sound of clattering heels, Heidi\u2019s happy voice calling out, \u2018Just a minute!\u2019 But again, nothing.</p><p>Reaching down, I tried the knob: it turned easily, the door opening, and I leaned my head inside. \u2018Hello?\u2019 I called out, my voice bouncing down a nearby empty hallway painted yellow and dotted with framed prints. \u2018Anyone here?\u2019</p><p>Silence. I stepped inside, shutting the door behind me. It was only then that I heard it: the sound of the ocean again, although it sounded a little different, and much closer by, like just around the corner. I followed it down the hallway, as it got louder and louder, expecting to see an open window or back door. Instead, I found myself in the living room, where the noise was deafening, and Heidi was sitting on the couch, holding the baby in her arms. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At least, I thought it was Heidi. It was hard to say for sure, as she looked nothing like the last time I\u2019d seen her. Her hair was pulled up into a messy, lopsided ponytail, with some strands stuck to her face, and she had on a ratty pair of sweatpants and an oversize U T-shirt, which had some kind of damp stain on one shoulder. Her eyes were closed, her head tipped back slightly. In fact, I thought she was asleep until, without even moving her lips, she hissed, \u2018If you wake her up, I will kill you.\u2019</p><p>I froze, alarmed, then took a careful step backward. \u2018Sorry,\u2019 I said. \u2018I just \u2013\u2019</p><p>Her eyes snapped open, and she whipped her head around, her eyes narrowing into little slits. When she spotted me, though, her expression changed to surprise. And then, just like that, she was crying.</p><p>\u2018Oh, God, Auden,\u2019 she said, her voice tight, \u2018I am so, so sorry. I forgot you were... and then I thought... but it\u2019s no excuse...\u2019 She trailed off, her shoulders heaving as, in her arms, the baby \u2013 who was tiny, so small she looked too delicate to even exist \u2013 slept on, completely unaware.</p> <p>I took a panicked look around the room, wondering where my dad was. Only then did I realize that the incredibly loud ocean sound I was hearing was not coming from outside but instead from a small white noise-machine sitting on the coffee table. Who listens to a fake ocean when the real one is in earshot? It was one of many things that, at that moment, made absolutely no sense.</p><p>\u2018Um,\u2019 I said as Heidi continued to cry, her sobs punctuated by an occasional loud sniffle, as well as the fake pounding waves, \u2018can I... do you need some help, or something?\u2019</p><p>She drew in a shaky breath, then looked up at me. Her eyes were rimmed with dark circles: there was a pimply red rash on her chin. \u2018No,\u2019 she said as fresh tears filled her eyes. \u2018I\u2019m okay. It\u2019s just... I\u2019m fine.\u2019</p><p>This seemed highly unlikely, even to my untrained eye. Not that I had time to dispute it, as right then my dad walked in, carrying a tray of coffees and a small brown paper bag. He was in his typical outfit of rumpled khakis and an untucked button-down shirt, his glasses sort of askew on his face. When he taught, he usually added a tie and tweedy sport jacket. His sneakers, though, were a constant, no matter what else he was wearing.</p><p>\u2018There she is!\u2019 he said when he spotted me, then headed over to give me a hug. As he pulled me close, I looked over his shoulder at Heidi, who was biting her lip, staring out the window at the ocean. \u2018How was the trip?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Good,\u2019 I said slowly as he pulled back and took a coffee out of the carrier, offering it to me. I took it, then watched as he helped himself to one before sticking the last on the table in front of Heidi, who just stared at it like she didn\u2019t know what it was.</p><p>\u2018Did you meet your sister?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Uh, no,\u2019 I said. \u2018Not yet.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, well!\u2019 He put down the paper bag, then reached over Heidi \u2013 who stiffened, not that he seemed to notice \u2013 taking the baby from her arms. \u2018Here she is. This is Thisbe.\u2019</p><p>I looked down at the baby\u2019s face, which was so small and delicate it didn\u2019t even seem real. Her eyes were shut, and she had tiny, spiky eyelashes. One of her hands was sticking out of her blanket, and the fingers were so little, curled slightly around one another. \u2018She\u2019s beautiful,\u2019 I said, because that is what you say.</p><p>\u2018Isn\u2019t she?\u2019 My dad grinned, bouncing her slightly in his arms, and her eyes slid open. She looked up at us, blinked, and then, just like her mom, suddenly began to cry. \u2018Whoops,\u2019 he said, jiggling her a bit. Thisbe cried a little louder. \u2018Honey?\u2019 my dad said, turning back to Heidi, who was still sitting in the exact same place and position, her arms now limp at her sides. \u2018I think she\u2019s hungry.\u2019</p> <p>Heidi swallowed, then turned to him wordlessly. When my father handed Thisbe over, she swiveled back to the windows, almost robotlike as the crying grew louder, then louder still.</p><p>\u2018Let\u2019s step outside,\u2019 my dad suggested, grabbing the paper bag off the end table and gesturing for me to follow him as he walked to a pair of sliding glass doors, opening one and leading me outside to the deck. Normally, the view would have left me momentarily speechless \u2013 the house was right on the beach, a walkway leading directly to the sand \u2013 but instead I found myself looking back at Heidi, only to realize she\u2019d disappeared, leaving her coffee untouched on the table.</p><p>\u2018Is she all right?\u2019 I asked.</p><p>He opened the paper bag, pulling out a muffin, then offering it to me. I shook my head. \u2018She\u2019s tired,\u2019 he said, taking a bite, a few crumbs falling onto his shirt. He brushed them off with one hand, then kept eating. \u2018The baby\u2019s up a lot at night, you know, and I\u2019m not much help because I have this sleep condition and have to get my nine hours, or else. I keep trying to convince her to get in some help, but she won\u2019t do it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why not?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, you know Heidi,\u2019 he said as if I did. \u2018She\u2019s got to do everything herself, and do it perfectly. But don\u2019t worry, she\u2019ll be fine. The first couple of months are just hard. I remember with Hollis, your mom was just about to go out of her mind. Of course, he was incredibly colicky. We used to walk him all night long, and he\u2019d still scream. And his appetite! Good Lord. He\u2019d suck your mom dry and still be ravenous...\u2019</p><p>He kept talking, but I\u2019d heard this song before, knew all the words, so I just sipped my coffee. Looking left, I could see a few more houses, then what appeared to be some sort of boardwalk lined with businesses, as well as a public beach, already crowded with umbrellas and sunbathers.</p><p>\u2018Anyway,\u2019 my father was saying now as he crumpled up his muffin wrapper, tossing it back in the bag, \u2018I\u2019ve got to get back to work, so let me show you your room. We can catch up over dinner, later. That sound good?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Sure,\u2019 I said as we headed back inside, where the sound machine was still blasting. My dad shook his head, then reached down, turning it off with a click: the sudden silence was jarring. \u2018So you\u2019re writing?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, yeah. I\u2019m on a real roll, definitely going to finish the book soon,\u2019 he replied. \u2018It\u2019s just a matter of organizing, really, getting the last little bits down on the page.\u2019 We went back to the foyer, then up the staircase. As we walked down the hallway, we passed an open door, through which I could see a pink wall with a brown polka-dot border. Inside, it was silent, no crying, at least that I could hear. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My dad pushed open the next door down, then waved me in with one hand. \u2018Sorry for the small quarters,\u2019 he said as I stepped over the threshold. \u2018But you have the best view.\u2019</p><p>He wasn\u2019t kidding. Though the room was tiny, with a twin bed, a bureau, and not much room for anything else, the lone window looked out over an undeveloped area of land, nothing but sea grass and sand and water. \u2018This is great,\u2019 I said.</p><p>\u2018Isn\u2019t it? It was originally my office. But then we had to put the baby\u2019s room next door, so I moved to the other side of the house. I didn\u2019t want to keep her up, you know, with the noises of my creative process.\u2019 He chuckled, like this was a joke I was supposed to get. \u2018Speaking of which, I\u2019d better get to it. The mornings have been really productive for me lately. I\u2019ll catch up with you at dinner, all right?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh,\u2019 I said, glancing at my watch. It was 11:05. \u2018Sure.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Great.\u2019 He squeezed my arm, then started down the hallway, humming to himself, as I watched him go. A moment after he passed the door to the pink-and-brown room, I heard the door click shut.</p><p>I woke up at six thirty that evening to the sound of a baby crying.</p><p>Crying, actually, was too tepid a word. Thisbe was screaming, her lungs clearly getting a serious workout. And while it was merely audible in my room, with just a thin wall between us, when I went out in the hallway in search of a bathroom to brush my teeth, the noise was deafening.</p><p>I stood for a second in the dimness outside the door to the pink room, listening to the cries as they rose, rose, rose, then fell sharply, only to spike again, even louder. I was wondering if I was the only one aware of it until, during a rare and short moment of silence, I heard someone saying, \u2018Shh, shh,\u2019 before quickly being drowned out again.</p><p>There was something so familiar about this, it was like a tug on my subconscious. When my parents had first started to fight at night, this had been part of what I\u2019d repeated \u2013 shh, shh, everything\u2019s all right \u2013 to myself, again and again, as I tried to ignore them and fall asleep. Hearing it now, though, felt strange, as I was used to the sound being private, only in my head and the dark around me, so I moved on.</p> <p>\u2018Dad?\u2019</p><p>My father, sitting in front of his laptop at a desk facing the wall, didn\u2019t move as he said, \u2018Hmmm?\u2019</p><p>I looked back down the hallway to the pink room, then at him again. He wasn\u2019t typing, just studying the screen, a yellow legal pad with some scribblings on the desk beside him. I wondered if he\u2019d been there the whole time I\u2019d been sleeping, over seven hours. \u2018Should I,\u2019 I said, \u2018um, start dinner, or something?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Isn\u2019t Heidi doing that?\u2019 he asked, still facing the screen.</p><p>\u2018I think she\u2019s with the baby,\u2019 I said.</p><p>\u2018Oh.\u2019 Now, he turned his head, looking at me. \u2018Well, if you\u2019re hungry, there\u2019s a great burger place just a block away. Their onion rings are legendary.\u2019</p> <p>I smiled. \u2018Sounds great,\u2019 I said. \u2018Should I find out if Heidi wants anything?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Absolutely. And get me a cheeseburger and some of those onion rings.\u2019 He reached into his back pocket, pulling out a couple of bills and handing them to me. \u2018Thanks a lot, Auden. I really appreciate it.\u2019</p><p>I took the bills, feeling like an idiot. Of course he couldn\u2019t go out with me: he had a new baby at home, a wife to take care of. \u2018No problem,\u2019 I said, even though he was already turning back to his screen, not really listening. \u2018I\u2019ll just be back in a little bit.\u2019</p><p>I walked back to the pink room, where Thisbe was still going full blast. Figuring at least this time I didn\u2019t have to worry about waking her up, I knocked twice. After a second, it opened a crack, and Heidi looked out at me.</p><p>She looked more haggard than before, if that was even possible: the ponytail was gone, her hair now hanging limp in her face. \u2018Hi,\u2019 I said, or rather shouted, over the screaming. \u2018I\u2019m going to get dinner. What would you like?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Dinner?\u2019 she repeated, her voice also raised. I nodded. \u2018Is it dinnertime already?\u2019</p><p>I looked at my watch, as if I needed to confirm this. \u2018It\u2019s about quarter to seven.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, dear God.\u2019 She closed her eyes. \u2018I was going to fix a big welcome dinner for you. I had it all planned, chicken and vegetables, and everything. But the baby\u2019s been so fussy, and...\u2019</p> <p>\u2018It\u2019s fine,\u2019 I said. \u2018I\u2019m going to get burgers. Dad says there\u2019s a good place right down the street.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Your father is here?\u2019 she asked, shifting Thisbe in her arms and peering over my shoulder, down the hallway. \u2018I thought he went down to campus.\u2019</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s working in his office,\u2019 I said. She leaned closer, clearly not having heard this. \u2018He\u2019s writing,\u2019 I repeated, more loudly. \u2018So I\u2019m going. What would you like?\u2019</p><p>Heidi just stood there, the baby screaming between us, looking down the hallway at the light spilling out from my dad\u2019s barely open office door. She started to speak, then stopped herself, taking a deep breath. \u2018Whatever you\u2019re having is fine,\u2019 she said after a moment. \u2018Thank you.\u2019</p><p>I nodded, then stepped back as she pushed the door back shut between us. The last thing I saw was the baby\u2019s red face, still howling.</p><p>Thankfully, outside the house it was much quieter. I could hear only the ocean and various neighborhood sounds \u2013 kids yelling, an occasional car radio, someone\u2019s TV blaring out a back door \u2013 as I walked down the street to where the neighborhood ended and the business district began.</p><p>There was a narrow boardwalk, lined with various shops: a smoothie place, one of those beach-tat joints that sell cheap towels and shell clocks, a pizzeria. About halfway down, I passed a small boutique called Clementine\u2019s, which had a bright orange awning. Taped to the front door was a piece of paper that read, in big block print, IT\u2019S A GIRL! THISBE CAROLINE WEST, BORN JUNE 1, 6 LBS, 15 OZ. So this was Heidi\u2019s store, I thought. There were racks of T-shirts and jeans, a makeup and body lotion section, and a dark-haired girl in a pink dress examining her fingernails behind the register, a cell phone clamped to her ear.</p><p>Up ahead, I could see what had to be the burger joint my dad mentioned \u2013 LAST CHANCE CAF\u00c9, BEST O RINGS ON THE BEACH! said the sign. Just before it, there was one last store, a bike shop. A bunch of guys around my age were gathered on a battered wooden bench outside, talking and watching people pass by. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018The thing is,\u2019 one of them, who was stocky and sporting shorts and a chain wallet, said, \u2018the name has to have punch. Energy, you know?\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s more important that it be clever,\u2019 another, who was taller and thinner with curly hair, a little dorky-looking, said. \u2018Which is why you should go with my choice, the Crankshaft. It\u2019s perfect.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It sounds like a car shop, not a bike place,\u2019 the short guy told him.</p><p>\u2018Bikes have cranks,\u2019 his friend pointed out.</p> <p>\u2018And cars have shafts.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So do mines,\u2019 the skinny guy said.</p><p>\u2018You want to call it the Mine Shaft now?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 his friend said as the other two laughed. \u2018I\u2019m just making the point that the context doesn\u2019t have to be exclusive.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Who cares about context?\u2019 The short guy sighed. \u2018What we need is a name that jumps out and sells product. Like, say, Zoom Bikes. Or Overdrive Bikes.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018How do you go into overdrive on a bike?\u2019 another guy, who had his back to me, asked. \u2018That\u2019s stupid.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It is not,\u2019 the guy with the wallet muttered. \u2018Besides, I don\u2019t see you offering up any suggestions.\u2019</p><p>I stepped away from Clementine\u2019s and starting walking again. Just as I did, the third guy suddenly turned, and our eyes met. He had dark hair, cut short, incredibly tanned skin, and a broad, confident smile, which he now flashed at me. \u2018How about,\u2019 he said slowly, his gaze still locked with mine, \u2018I just saw the hottest girl in Colby walking by?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, Jesus,\u2019 the dorky one said, shaking his head, as the other one laughed out loud. \u2018You\u2019re pathetic.\u2019</p><p>I felt my face flush hot, even as I ignored him and kept walking. I could feel him looking at me, still smiling, as I put more and more distance between us. \u2018Just stating the obvious,\u2019 he called out, as I was about out of earshot. \u2018You could say thank you, you know.\u2019</p><p>But I didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t say anything, if only because I had no idea how to respond to such an overture. If my experience with friends was sparse, what I knew about boys \u2013 other than as competitors for grades or class rank \u2013 was nonexistent.</p> <p>Not that I hadn\u2019t had crushes. Back at Jackson, there was a guy in my science class, hopeless at equations, who always made my palms sweat whenever we got paired for experiments. And at Perkins Day, I\u2019d awkwardly flirted with Nate Cross, who sat next to me in calculus, but everyone was in love with Nate, so that hardly made me special. It wasn\u2019t until Kiffney-Brown, when I met Jason Talbot, that I really thought I might actually have one of those boyfriend kind of stories to tell the next time I got together with my old friends. Jason was smart, good-looking, and seriously on the rebound after his girlfriend at Jackson dumped him for, in his words, \u2018a juvenile delinquent welder with a tattoo\u2019. Because of Kiffney-Brown\u2019s small seminar size, we spent a fair amount of time together, battling it out for valedictorian, and when he\u2019d asked me to prom I\u2019d been more excited than I ever would have admitted. Until he backed out, citing the \u2018great opportunity\u2019 of the ecology conference. \u2018I knew you\u2019d be okay with this,\u2019 he\u2019d said to me as I nodded, dumbly, hearing this news. \u2018You understand what\u2019s really important.\u2019</p><p>Okay, so it wasn\u2019t like he called me beautiful. But it was a compliment, in its own way.</p><p>It was crowded at Last Chance Caf\u00e9, with a line of people waiting to be seated and two cooks visible through a small kitchen window, racing around as orders piled up on the spindle in front of them. I gave my order to a pretty, dark-haired girl with a lip ring, then took a seat by the window to wait for it. Glancing down the boardwalk, I could see the guys still gathered around the bench: the one who\u2019d talked to me was now sitting down, his arms stretched behind his head, laughing, as his short, stocky friend rode a bike back and forth in front of him, doing little hops here and there.</p><p>It took a while for the food to be ready, but I soon realized my dad was right. It was worth the wait. I was digging into the onion rings before I even got out the door to the boardwalk, which by then was crowded with families eating ice-cream cones, couples on dates, and tons of little kids running along the sand. In the distance, there was a gorgeous sunset, all oranges and pinks, and I kept my eyes on it as I walked, not even looking over at the bike shop until I was almost past it. The guy was still there, although now he was talking to a tall girl with red hair, who was wearing a massive pair of sunglasses.</p><p>\u2018Hey,\u2019 he called out to me, \u2018if you\u2019re looking for something to do tonight, there\u2019s a bonfire at the Tip. I\u2019ll save you a seat.\u2019</p><p>I glanced over at him. The redhead was now giving me the stink eye, an annoyed look on her face, so I didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u2018Ah, she\u2019s a heartbreaker!\u2019 he said, then laughed. I kept walking, now feeling the redhead\u2019s gaze boring in somewhere between my shoulder blades. \u2018Just keep it in mind. I\u2019ll wait for you.\u2019</p><p>Back at the house, I found three plates and some silverware, then set the table and put out the food. I was shaking ketchup packets out into a pile when my dad came downstairs.</p> <p>\u2018I thought I smelled onion rings,\u2019 he said, rubbing his hands together. \u2018This looks great.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Is Heidi coming down?\u2019 I asked, sliding his burger onto a plate.</p><p>\u2018Not sure,\u2019 he replied, helping himself to an onion ring. Mouth full, he added, \u2018The baby\u2019s having a hard night. She probably wants to get her to sleep first.\u2019</p><p>I glanced up the stairs, wondering if it was possible that Thisbe was still crying, as I\u2019d been gone at least an hour. \u2018Maybe I\u2019ll, um, just ask her if she wants me to bring it up to her.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sure, great,\u2019 he said, pulling out a chair and sitting down. I stood there for a second, watching as he ate another ring, tugging a nearby newspaper over with his free hand. I\u2019d wanted to have dinner with my dad, sure, but I felt kind of bad about it happening this way.</p><p>Thisbe was still crying: I could hear her as soon as I got to the top of the stairs, Heidi\u2019s dinner on a plate in one hand. When I got to the pink room, the door was ajar, and inside I could see her sitting in a rocking chair, her eyes closed, moving back and forth, back and forth. I was understandably hesitant to bother her, but she must have smelled the food, because a beat later, she opened her eyes.</p><p>\u2018I thought you might be hungry,\u2019 I called out. \u2018Do you \u2013 should I bring this to you?\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She blinked at me, then looked down at Thisbe, who was still howling. \u2018You can just put it down,\u2019 she said, nodding at a nearby white bureau. \u2018I\u2019ll get to it in a second.\u2019</p><p>I walked over, moving aside a stuffed giraffe and a book called Your Baby: The Basics, which was opened to a page with the heading \u2018Fussiness: What Causes It, and What You Can Do\u2019. Either she hadn\u2019t had time to read it, or that book didn\u2019t know jack, I thought as I slid the plate over.</p><p>\u2018Thanks,\u2019 Heidi said. She was still rocking, the motion almost hypnotic, although clearly not to Thisbe, who continued to cry at full volume. \u2018I just... I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing wrong. She\u2019s fed, she\u2019s changed, I\u2019m holding her, and it\u2019s like... she hates me, or something.\u2019</p><p>\u2018She\u2019s probably just colicky,\u2019 I said.</p> <p>\u2018But what does that mean, exactly?\u2019 She swallowed hard, then looked back down at her daughter\u2019s face. \u2018It just doesn\u2019t make sense, and I\u2019m doing all I can...\u2019</p><p>She trailed off, her voice getting tight, and I thought of my dad downstairs, eating his onion rings and reading the paper. Why wasn\u2019t he up here? I didn\u2019t know jack about babies either. Just as I thought this, though, Heidi looked up at me again.</p><p>\u2018Oh, God, Auden, I\u2019m so sorry.\u2019 She shook her head. \u2018I\u2019m sure this is the last thing you want to hear about. You\u2019re young, you should be out having fun!\u2019 She sniffled, reaching up to rub her eyes with one hand. \u2018You know, there\u2019s a place called the Tip, just down the road from here. All the girls at my shop hang out there at night. You should go check it out. It has to be better than this, right?\u2019</p><p>Agreed, I thought, but it seemed rude to actually say that. \u2018Maybe I will,\u2019 I said.</p><p>She nodded, like we\u2019d made a deal, then looked back at Thisbe. \u2018Thanks for the food,\u2019 she said. \u2018I really... I appreciate it.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018No problem,\u2019 I told her. But she was still looking at the baby, her face weary, so I took this as a dismissal and left, shutting the door behind me.</p><p>Downstairs, my dad was finishing his dinner, perusing the sports section. When I slid into a chair opposite him, he looked up at me and smiled. \u2018So how\u2019s she doing? Baby asleep?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Not really,\u2019 I told him, unwrapping my burger. \u2018She\u2019s still screaming.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yikes.\u2019 He pushed his chair back, standing up. \u2018I better go check in.\u2019</p><p>Finally, I thought as he disappeared up the stairs. I picked up my burger, taking a bite: it was cold, but still good. I\u2019d only eaten about half of it when he reappeared, walking to the fridge and grabbing a beer. I sat there, chewing, as he popped the top, took a sip, and looked out at the water.</p><p>\u2018Everything okay up there?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Oh, sure,\u2019 he said easily, moving the bottle to his other hand. \u2018She\u2019s just colicky, like Hollis was. Not much you can do except wait it out.\u2019</p><p>The thing was, I loved my dad. He might have been a little moody, and definitely more than a little selfish, but he\u2019d always been good to me, and I admired him. Right at that moment, though, I could see why someone might not like him that much. \u2018Does Heidi... is her mom coming to help out, or anything?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Her mom died a couple of years ago,\u2019 he said, taking another sip of his beer. \u2018She has a brother, but he\u2019s older, lives in Cincinnati with kids of his own.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What about a nanny or something?\u2019</p><p>Now he looked at me. \u2018She doesn\u2019t want help,\u2019 he said. \u2018It\u2019s like I told you, she wants to do this on her own.\u2019</p><p>I had a flash of Heidi craning her neck, looking down at my dad\u2019s office, the grateful look on her face when I brought her dinner. \u2018Maybe,\u2019 I said, \u2018you should, you know, insist, though. She seems pretty tired.\u2019</p><p>He just looked at me for a moment, a flat expression on his face. \u2018Auden,\u2019 he said finally, \u2018this isn\u2019t something you need to worry about, all right? Heidi and I will work it out.\u2019</p><p>In other words, back off. And he was right. This was his house, I was a guest here. It was presumptuous to show up and just assume I knew better, based on only a few hours. \u2018Right,\u2019 I said, balling up my napkin. \u2018Of course.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018All right,\u2019 he said, his voice relaxed again. \u2018So... I\u2019m going to head upstairs, get back to it. I\u2019d like to finish this chapter tonight. You\u2019ll be okay on your own?\u2019</p><p>It wasn\u2019t even really a question, only phrased to sound like one. Funny how intonation could do so much, change even what something was at its core. \u2018Sure,\u2019 I said. \u2018Go ahead. I\u2019ll be fine.\u2019</p><p>Chapter THREE</p><p>I wasn\u2019t fine, though. I was bored, and Thisbe was still hollering. I unpacked my clothes, tried to crack my future Econ 101 textbook, and cleaned out all the messages on my phone. All of which took about forty minutes. At that point, with the baby still crying \u2013 still crying! \u2013 I finally grabbed a jacket, pulled my hair back, and went out for a walk.</p><p>At first, I wasn\u2019t planning to go to the Tip, whatever or wherever it was. I just wanted some air, a break from the noise, and a chance to process whatever it was that had happened between my dad and me earlier that evening. But after I walked in the opposite direction from the boardwalk for about a block, the sidewalk ended in a culde-sac, a bunch of parked cars crowded along the edges. A path was visible off to one side, and I could see light in the distance. Probably a mistake, I thought, but then I thought of Hollis in that picture frame, and followed it anyway.</p><p>It wound through some beach grass and over a couple of dunes, then opened up to a wide swath of sand. From the look of it, it had once been all beach, until erosion or a storm or both created a peninsula of sorts, where now a bunch of people were gathered, some sitting on driftwood that was piled up in makeshift benches, others standing around a firepit where a good-size blaze was going. A large truck was parked off to one side, a keg in the bed, and I recognized the tall, skinny guy from the bike shop sitting beside it. When he saw me, he looked surprised, then glanced over at the fire. Sure enough, the guy who\u2019d called out to me was there, in a red windbreaker, holding a plastic cup. He was talking to two girls \u2013 the redhead from earlier and a shorter girl with black hair, braided into pigtails \u2013 gesturing widely with his free hand.</p><p>\u2018On your right!\u2019 I heard someone yell from behind me, and then there was a whizzing sound. I turned, only to see the short, stocky guy I\u2019d seen earlier coming at me fast on a bike, pedaling wildly. I jumped out of the way just as he blasted by, rounding the dune and shooting onto the flatter sand of the beach. I was still trying to catch my breath when I heard the clatter of pedals, and two more bikes emerged from the dark of the path, the riders \u2013 a blond guy, and a girl with short, cropped hair \u2013 laughing and talking with each other as they zoomed past. Jesus, I thought, stepping back again, only to feel myself collide squarely with something. Or someone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When I turned, I found myself facing a tall guy with longish dark hair pulled back at his neck, wearing a worn blue hoodie and jeans. He glanced at me quickly \u2013 his eyes were green, and deep set \u2013 barely seeming to register my face.</p><p>\u2018Sorry,\u2019 I said, although it wasn\u2019t my fault: he was the one creeping up behind. But he just nodded, as if I\u2019d owed him this, and continued to the beach, sliding his hands in his pockets.</p><p>I hardly needed another sign that it was time to turn back. As I went to do just that, though, I heard a voice from behind me. \u2018See? I knew you couldn\u2019t resist me!\u2019</p><p>I turned, and there was the guy from the boardwalk, still holding his cup. The redhead and the girl with pigtails were now standing by the keg, watching disapprovingly as he walked toward me. I was suddenly nervous, not sure how to respond, but then I had a flash of my mom at our kitchen table, surrounded by all those graduate students. Maybe I didn\u2019t know what I would say. But I knew my mother, and her techniques, by heart.</p> <p>\u2018I can resist you,\u2019 I told him.</p><p>\u2018Well, of course you would think that. I haven\u2019t begun my offensive yet,\u2019 he said.</p><p>\u2018Your offensive?\u2019 I asked.</p><p>He grinned. His smile \u2013 bright, wide, verging on goofy \u2013 was his best trait, and he knew it. \u2018I\u2019m Jake. Let me get you a beer.\u2019</p><p>Huh, I thought. This wasn\u2019t so hard after all.</p> <p>\u2018I\u2019ll get it myself,\u2019 I told him. \u2018Just point the way.\u2019</p><p>What\u2019s your problem?</p><p>I didn\u2019t know how to answer this. Not when Jake first asked it, as I pulled away from him, gathering my shirt around me, and stumbled over the dunes back to the path. And not as I walked back up my dad\u2019s street, trying to shake the sand out of my hair. My lips felt full and rubbed raw, the closure of my bra, hurriedly snapped, digging into the skin of my back as I let myself in the side door, shutting it behind me.</p><p>I crept upstairs, down the dark hallway, glad to hear nothing but my own footsteps. Finally, Thisbe was asleep. After a long, hot shower, I put on some yoga pants and a tank top, then settled into my room, opening my Econ textbook again. But even as I tried to focus on the words, the events of the night came rushing back to me: my dad\u2019s sharp tone, Jake\u2019s easy smile, our fumbled, hurried connection behind the dunes, and how it suddenly all felt so weird and wrong, not like me at all. Maybe my mom could play the aloof, selfish bitch. But that was what I\u2019d been doing: playing. Until the game was up. I was a smart girl. Why had I done something so stupid?</p><p>I felt tears fill my eyes, the words blurring on the page, and pressed my palm to my face, trying to stop them. No luck. Instead, they were contagious: a moment later, I heard Thisbe start up again, followed by the sound of someone \u2013 Heidi, I knew \u2013 coming down the hall and a door opening, then closing.</p><p>She kept on for an hour, long after my own tears had stopped and dried. Maybe it was the guilt I felt about what I\u2019d done that night. Or that I just needed a distraction from my own problems. Whatever the reason, I found myself stepping out into the hallway, then walking to the door to Thisbe\u2019s room. This time, I didn\u2019t knock. I just pushed the door open, and Heidi, her face ragged, streaked with its own tears, looked up at me from the rocking chair. \u2018Give her to me,\u2019 I said, holding out my arms. \u2018You get some rest.\u2019</p> <p>I was pretty sure Your Baby: The Basics didn\u2019t say anything about sunrise walks on the boardwalk as a cure for colic. But you never knew.</p><p>At first, I wasn\u2019t sure Heidi was going to let me take her. Even after the hours of crying, and her clear and present exhaustion, she still hesitated. It wasn\u2019t until I took one more step toward her and added, \u2018Come on,\u2019 that she let out a big breath, and the next thing I knew my sister was in my arms.</p><p>She was so, so small. And writhing, which made her seem all the more fragile, although with all the screaming she had to have some strength to her somewhere. Her skin was warm against mine, and I could feel the dampness at the base of her neck, the hair wet there. Poor baby, I thought, surprising myself.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know what she needs,\u2019 Heidi said, flopping back into the rocking chair, which then banged against the wall. \u2018I just... I can\u2019t... I can\u2019t listen to her cry anymore.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Go to sleep,\u2019 I told her.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 she mumbled. \u2018Maybe I should \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Go,\u2019 I said, and while I didn\u2019t mean for my voice to sound so sharp, it worked. She pushed herself out of the chair, sniffling past me and down the hallway to her room.</p><p>Which left me alone with Thisbe, who was still screaming. For a little while, I just tried to walk her: in her room, then downstairs, through the kitchen, around the island, back to the living room again, which quieted her a bit, but not much. Then I noticed the stroller, parked by the door. It was about five when I strapped her in, still hollering, and began to push her down the driveway. By the time we got to the mailbox, twenty feet farther, she\u2019d stopped.</p> <p>No way, I thought, pausing myself and looking down at her. A beat passed, and then I watched her draw in a breath and start up again, louder than before. I quickly began pushing her once more, and after a few turns of the wheels... silence again. I picked up the pace and turned out onto the street.</p><p>By the time we got to the business district she was asleep under her blanket, eyes closed, face relaxed. Ahead of us, the boardwalk was deserted, a brisk breeze blowing across it. All I could hear was the ocean and the stroller wheels clacking beneath my feet.</p><p>We\u2019d walked all the way to the Last Chance Caf\u00e9 before we finally saw another person, and even then they were far off in the distance, just a speck and some movement. It wasn\u2019t until we came back up on the orange awning of Clementine\u2019s that I realized it was someone on a bike. They were in a spot where the boardwalk opened up to the beach, and I watched, squinting, as they went up on their front wheel, hopping for a few feet, then easing back down, spinning the handlebars. Then they were pedaling backward, zigzagging, before suddenly speeding forward, banking off a nearby bench, then down again. The movements were fluid, almost hypnotic: I thought of Heidi in the rocking chair, and Thisbe asleep in the stroller, the subtle, calming power of motion. I was so distracted, watching the person on the bike, that it wasn\u2019t until I got right up to him that I recognized the blue hoodie, that dark hair pulled back at the neck. It was the same guy I\u2019d bumped into on the path hours earlier.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This time, though, I was taking him by surprise, which was made obvious by the way he jerked, skidding to a clumsy stop when he suddenly spotted us standing not ten feet from him. Just by his glance, I knew he recognized me, too, although he wasn\u2019t exactly friendly \u2013 no hello. But then, I hadn\u2019t said anything either. In fact, we both just stood there, looking at each other. It probably would have been incredibly awkward, if Thisbe hadn\u2019t started crying again.</p><p>\u2018Oh,\u2019 I said, quickly pushing the stroller forward, then back again. She quieted immediately but kept her eyes open, looking at the sky overhead. The guy was watching her, and for some reason, I felt compelled to add, \u2018She\u2019s... it\u2019s been a long night.\u2019</p><p>He looked at me again, and his face was so serious. Almost haunted, although why that word came to mind, I had no idea. He turned his gaze back to Thisbe, then said, \u2018Aren\u2019t they all.\u2019</p><p>I opened my mouth to say something \u2013 to agree, at least \u2013 but he didn\u2019t give me the chance, was already pedaling backward. No good-bye, no nothing, just a spin of the handlebars, and then he was rising up on the pedals and riding away from us. Instead of a straight line, he moved down the boardwalk from side to side, zigzagging slowly, all the way to the end.</p> <p>Chapter FOUR</p><p>\u2018For you.\u2019</p><p>I looked down: sitting in front of me on a little yellow plate was a plump, perfect blueberry muffin. A pat of butter sat next to it, like an accessory.</p><p>\u2018Your dad said they were your favorite,\u2019 Heidi said. \u2018I got the berries this morning, from the farmers\u2019 market, and made them fresh.\u2019</p><p>While she was still clearly tired, now my stepmother looked a lot more like the Heidi I knew: her hair was pulled back neatly, and she had on jeans, a clean and matching shirt, and lip gloss. \u2018You really didn\u2019t have to do this,\u2019 I said.</p> <p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 she replied. Her voice was flat, serious. \u2018I did.\u2019</p><p>It was two P.M., and I\u2019d just come down from a good seven hours of sleep to find her in the kitchen, rinsing out a mixing bowl, the baby asleep in the crook of her other arm. I was headed straight for the coffeemaker and not up for conversation, but before I even knew what was happening she\u2019d blindsided me with a hug and baked goods.</p><p>\u2018Because of you,\u2019 she said now, sliding into a chair opposite me, shifting the baby slightly, \u2018I got the first uninterrupted four hours of sleep since she was born. It was like a miracle.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It really was not that big a deal,\u2019 I told her, wishing she\u2019d just leave it alone. All this fussing over a person, it just smacked of desperation to me.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m serious,\u2019 she said, clearly not getting the hint. \u2018You are officially my favorite person in the world right now.\u2019</p><p>Great, I thought. Then I peeled back the muffin wrapper, taking a bite instead of responding. It was still warm, and delicious, and made me feel horribly ungrateful for everything I\u2019d felt since laying eyes on her. \u2018This is really good,\u2019 I said.</p> <p>\u2018I\u2019m so glad!\u2019 she said as the phone rang. \u2018Like I said, it was the least I could do.\u2019</p><p>I took another bite as she stood, shifting the baby to her other arm, then grabbed the receiver off the counter. \u2018Hello? Oh, Maggie, good, I\u2019ve been wondering if that shipment came in...Wait, are you okay?\u2019 She narrowed her eyes. \u2018You sound like you\u2019ve been crying. Are you crying?\u2019</p><p>Good Lord, I thought, picking up the newspaper and scanning the headlines. What was it about the women in this town? Was everyone emotional?</p><p>\u2018Okay,\u2019 Heidi said slowly. \u2018I just couldn\u2019t help but notice... No, no, of course. What? Well, it should be in the office, right in that left-hand drawer. It\u2019s not? Huh. Well, let me think...\u2019 She looked around the room, then threw a hand over her mouth. Her voice rose as she said, \u2018Oh, crap. It\u2019s here, I see it over by the door. God, how did that happen? No, I\u2019ll just bring it down right now. It\u2019s not a problem, I\u2019ll just pop Thisbe in her stroller...\u2019</p><p>The person on the other line was saying something, the voice equally high and shrill. I took a gulp of my coffee, then another one, just as Thisbe began to chime in as well. I wondered if emotions were like menstrual cycles, if you got enough women together. Give it time, and everyone was crying.</p><p>\u2018Oh, dear,\u2019 Heidi said, glancing at her watch. \u2018Look, I\u2019m going to have to feed her before we can go anywhere. Just tell the delivery guy... Is there enough cash in the drawer? Well, can you check?\u2019 There was a pause, during which Thisbe went from sputtering to all-out crying. Heidi sighed. \u2018All right. No, we\u2019ll come right now. Just... hold tight. Okay. Bye.\u2019</p><p>She hung up, then walked across the room to the bottom of the stairs, jiggling Thisbe slightly as she went. \u2018Robert?\u2019 she called up the stairs. \u2018Honey?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes?\u2019 my dad replied a moment later, his voice muffled.</p> <p>\u2018Do you think you can feed Thisbe for me? I have to run the checkbook down to the store.\u2019</p><p>I heard footsteps overhead, then my dad\u2019s voice, louder and clearer, saying, \u2018Are you talking to me?\u2019</p><p>Thisbe chose this moment to increase her volume: Heidi had to shout over her as she said, \u2018I was just wondering if you could give Thisbe a bottle, I need to go down to the store because I left the checkbook here, and I thought they could cover this COD charge with cash but there isn\u2019t enough...\u2019</p><p>Too much information, I thought, sucking down the rest of my coffee. Why did she always have to make everything so complicated?</p><p>\u2018Honey, I\u2019m not really at a good stopping point,\u2019 my dad said. \u2018Can it wait twenty minutes?\u2019</p><p>Thisbe howled in response, pretty much answering this question. \u2018Um,\u2019 Heidi said, looking down at her, \u2018I don\u2019t know \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Fine,\u2019 my dad said, and instantly I recognized his tone, put upon and petulant. Fine, he\u2019d said to my mom, you just support us with your job. Fine, I guess you do know more about what the publishing industry wants. Fine, I\u2019ll just give up my writing altogether, it\u2019s not like I was ever nominated for a National Book Award. \u2018Just give me a minute, and I\u2019ll \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll take it down there,\u2019 I said, pushing my chair back. Heidi glanced over at me, surprised, but not nearly as much as I was myself. I thought I\u2019d given up this kind of co-dependent behavior years ago. \u2018I want to go up to the beach anyway.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Are you sure?\u2019 Heidi asked. \u2018Because you were such a help last night, I don\u2019t want to ask you to \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018She\u2019s offering, Heidi,\u2019 my dad said. I still couldn\u2019t see him, only hear his voice, booming down from sights unseen, like God. \u2018Don\u2019t be a martyr.\u2019</p><p>Which was good advice, I was thinking ten minutes later, as I walked down the boardwalk, the checkbook \u2013 and some muffins for the girls! \u2013 in hand. Twenty-four hours in Colby and already I didn\u2019t recognize myself. My mother would be disgusted, I thought. I knew I was.</p><p>When I walked into Clementine\u2019s, the first thing I saw was the dark-haired girl from the night before standing by the counter talking to a UPS guy. \u2018The thing is,\u2019 she was saying, \u2018I know it\u2019s stupid that I\u2019m still crying over him. But we went out for, like, two years. It wasn\u2019t just a fling. We were serious, as serious as things like that can be. So some days, like today... it\u2019s just hard.\u2019</p> <p>The UPS man, who looked decidedly uncomfortable, brightened at the sight of me. \u2018Looks like your checkbook\u2019s here,\u2019 he said.</p><p>\u2018Oh!\u2019 She turned to face me, then blinked, confused. \u2018Is Heidi... are you... ?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Her stepdaughter,\u2019 I explained.</p><p>\u2018Really? That\u2019s great. Are you here to help with the baby?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Not \u2013\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I can\u2019t wait to meet her,\u2019 she said before I could finish. \u2018And I love her name! It\u2019s so unusual. Although I thought Heidi was naming her Isabel or Caroline? But maybe I was wrong...\u2019</p><p>I handed over the checkbook, then the bag. When she glanced at it, quizzical, I added, \u2018Muffins.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Really?\u2019 she said excitedly, opening the bag. \u2018Oh, these smell delicious. Here, Ramon, you want one?\u2019 She offered the bag to the UPS guy, who reached in and took one, then to me. I shook my head, and she helped herself. \u2018Thanks so much. Here, I\u2019ll just write the check quick and send it back with you, because I think Heidi needed it for some bill stuff, and I wouldn\u2019t want you to have to make another trip. Although it is handy to have it here, but at the same time...\u2019</p><p>I nodded \u2013 too much information, again \u2013 then walked over to a display of jeans, leaving her to chatter on. Behind the jeans, tucked away against a back wall, were some bathing suits on sale, so I started picking through them. I was checking out a red, boy-short bikini that wasn\u2019t entirely hideous when I heard the front door chime.</p><p>\u2018I brought caffeine,\u2019 a girl\u2019s voice called out. \u2018Double mocha, extra whip. Your favorite.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And I,\u2019 another chimed in, \u2018have the very latest issue of Hollyworld. They just got dropped at the newsstand, like, ten minutes ago.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018You guys!\u2019 Maggie squealed. I glanced over, but because of the rack of suits, my view was blocked: she was all I could see now, as Ramon had clearly left the building, lucky guy. \u2018What\u2019s the occasion?\u2019</p><p>No one spoke for a moment, and I went back to my browsing. Then one of the girls said, \u2018Well... the truth is, we have something we have to tell you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Tell me?\u2019 Maggie said.</p><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 the other girl told her. There was a pause. Then, \u2018Now, before we do, I want to stress that this is for your own good. Okay?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Okay,\u2019 Maggie said slowly. \u2018But I don\u2019t like the sound of \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Jake hooked up with another girl last night,\u2019 the first girl blurted out. \u2018At the Tip.\u2019</p><p>Oh, shit, I thought.</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 Maggie gasped.</p> <p>\u2018Leah!\u2019 one girl said. \u2018Jesus. I thought we agreed we were going to break it to her gently.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You wanted to break it to her gently,\u2019 Leah replied. \u2018I said we should just do it fast and all at once, like an eyebrow wax.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Are you guys serious?\u2019 Maggie\u2019s voice was tight, high, and I shrank farther into the bathing suits, wondering if there was a back exit. \u2018How do you know? Who was it? I mean, how...\u2019</p><p>\u2018We were there,\u2019 Leah said flatly. \u2018We saw her show up and we saw them talking and then walk off to the dunes together.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And you didn\u2019t stop him?\u2019 Maggie shrieked.</p><p>\u2018Hey,\u2019 the other girl said. \u2018Calm down, okay?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t tell me to calm down, okay, Esther? Who was she?\u2019</p><p>Another silence. Stupid Heidi and her stupid checkbook, I thought, burying myself more deeply into the nearby one-pieces. \u2018We don\u2019t know,\u2019 Leah said. \u2018Some summer girl, a tourist.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, what did she look like?\u2019 Maggie demanded.</p><p>\u2018Does it really matter?\u2019 Esther replied.</p><p>\u2018Of course it matters! It\u2019s paramount.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It is not,\u2019 Leah said with a sigh, \u2018paramount.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Was she cuter than me?\u2019 Maggie asked. \u2018Taller? I bet she was a blonde. Was she a blonde?\u2019</p><p>Silence. I peered out from behind the rack of suits, by this point not surprised at all to see the redhead and the girl in the pigtails from the bonfire. They exchanged a look before pigtails \u2013 Esther \u2013 said, \u2018She had black hair and fair skin. Taller than you, but kind of bony.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And her skin wasn\u2019t that great,\u2019 the redhead, who had to be Leah, added.</p><p>I felt myself flinch, hearing this. First, I was not bony. And okay, so I had a couple of zits, but they were temporary, not a condition. And anyway, who were they to say \u2013</p><p>Suddenly, the bathing-suit rack before me parted right down the middle, like the Red Sea. And just like that, with a clattering of hangers, I found myself face to face with Maggie.</p><p>\u2018Did she,\u2019 she said, narrowing her eyes at me, \u2018look like this, maybe?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Holy crap,\u2019 Leah said. Beside her, Esther slapped a hand over her mouth.</p><p>\u2018I can\u2019t believe this,\u2019 Maggie said as I fought the urge to try to protect myself with a nearby bandeau. \u2018Did you hook up with Jake last night?\u2019</p><p>I swallowed, the sound seeming louder than a gunshot. \u2018It wasn\u2019t,\u2019 I began, then realized my voice was wavering and stopped, taking a breath. \u2018It was nothing.\u2019</p><p>Maggie sucked in a breath, her cheeks hollowing. \u2018Nothing,\u2019 she repeated. Then she dropped her hands from the suits on the rack, letting them flop to her sides. \u2018You hook up with the love of my life, the boy I wanted to marry \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, man,\u2019 Leah said. \u2018Here we go.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018And it\u2019s nothing?

It\u2019s not about her.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Then what it is about, exactly?\u2019</p><p>Esther sighed. \u2018You knew this was going to happen sooner or later.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018No,\u2019 Maggie protested. \u2018I didn\u2019t know that. I didn\u2019t know that at all.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, you did.\u2019 Esther put her hand on her shoulder, squeezing it. \u2018Face it. If it wasn\u2019t her, it just would have been some other girl.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Some other stupid girl, \u2019 Leah added, picking up the magazine and flipping through it. Then, as an afterthought, she glanced at me and said, \u2018No offense. He\u2019s just an idiot.\u2019</p><p>\u2018He is not,\u2019 Maggie protested, tears filling her eyes.</p><p>\u2018Come on, Mag. You know he is.\u2019 Esther glanced at me, then slid her hand down Maggie\u2019s arm, wrapping a hand over hers. \u2018And now, you can really start to get over him. If you think about it, this is probably the best thing that could have happened.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018That\u2019s right,\u2019 Leah agreed, flipping another page.</p><p>\u2018How do you figure?\u2019 Maggie whimpered, but she allowed herself to be led back to the counter, numbly taking her mocha as Leah handed it off to her.</p><p>\u2018Because,\u2019 Esther said gently, \u2018you were still just hanging on, torturing yourself, thinking he was coming back. And now you have to let go. She kind of did you a favor, if you really think about it.\u2019</p><p>Maggie looked back over at me, and I made myself stand up straighter. I couldn\u2019t believe I\u2019d actually been worried about her: she was tiny, pink as a powder puff. Thinking this, I emerged from behind the suits and started for the door.</p><p>\u2018Wait a second,\u2019 she said.</p><p>I didn\u2019t have to stop. I knew that. Still, I slowed my steps, turning back to her. But I didn\u2019t say anything.</p> <p>\u2018Do you,\u2019 she began, then stopped and took a breath. \u2018Do you really like him? Just tell me. I know it\u2019s pathetic, but I need to know.\u2019</p><p>I just looked at her for moment, feeling all those eyes on me. \u2018He\u2019s nothing to me,\u2019 I said.</p><p>She kept her gaze on me a moment longer. Then she picked up the checkbook, walking over and holding it out to me. \u2018Thanks,\u2019 she said.</p><p>Maybe in the world of girls, this was supposed to be a turning point. When we saw beyond our initial differences, realized we had something in common after all, and became true friends. But that was a place I didn\u2019t know well, had never lived in, and had no interest in discovering, even as a tourist. So I took the checkbook, nodded, and walked out the door, leaving them \u2013 as I had so many other groups \u2013 to say whatever they would about me once I was gone.</p><p>\u2018So,\u2019 my mother said, \u2018tell me everything.\u2019</p><p>It was late afternoon, and I\u2019d been dead asleep when my phone rang. Even without looking at it, I knew it had to be my mom. First, because it was her favorite time to make phone calls, right at the start of cocktail hour. It wasn\u2019t like I was expecting to hear from anyone else, except maybe my brother, Hollis, and he only called in the middle of the night, having yet to fully grasp the concept of time zones.</p><p>\u2018Well,\u2019 I said, stifling a yawn, \u2018it\u2019s really pretty here. You should see the view.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sure it is,\u2019 she replied. \u2018But don\u2019t bore me with the scenery, I need details. How is your father?\u2019</p> <p>I swallowed, then glanced at my shut door, as if I could somehow see through it, all the way down to his. Amazing how easily my mother could get to the one thing I didn\u2019t want to talk about. She always just knew.</p><p>I\u2019d now been at my dad\u2019s for three days, during which I\u2019d probably seen him a total of, oh, three hours. He was either in his office working, in his bedroom sleeping, or in the kitchen grabbing a quick bite, en route to one or the other. So much for my visions of us hanging out and bonding, sharing a plate of onion rings and discussing literature and my future. Instead, our conversations usually took place on the stairs, a quick, \u2018How\u2019s it going? Been to the beach today?\u2019 as we went in opposite directions. Even these, though, were better than the efforts I\u2019d made at knocking on his office door. Then, he didn\u2019t even bother to turn away from the computer screen, my attempts at dialogue bouncing off the back of his head like shots missing the rim by a mile.</p><p>It sucked. What was worse, though, was that if my father was nonexistent, Heidi was everywhere. If I went to get coffee, she was in the kitchen, feeding the baby. If I tried to hide on the deck, she emerged, Thisbe in the BabyBj\u00f6rn, inviting me to join them for a walk on the beach. Even in my room I wasn\u2019t safe, as it was so close to the nursery that even the slightest movement or noise summoned her, as she assumed I was as desperate for companionship as she was.</p><p>Clearly, she was lonely. But I wasn\u2019t. I was accustomed to being alone: I liked it. Which was why it was surprising that I even noticed my dad\u2019s lack of attention, much less cared. But for some reason, I did. And all her muffins and chatter and over-friendliness just made it worse.</p><p>I could have told my mother all of this. After all, it was exactly what she wanted to hear. But to do so, for some reason, seemed like a failure. I mean, what had I expected, anyway? So I took a different tack.</p><p>\u2018Well,\u2019 I began, \u2018he\u2019s writing a lot. He\u2019s in his office every day, all day.\u2019</p><p>A pause as she processed this. Then, \u2018Really.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah,\u2019 I said. \u2018He says he\u2019s almost done with the book, just has some tightening up to do.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Tightening up that takes all day, every day,\u2019 she said. Ouch. \u2018What about the baby? Is he helping Heidi out with her?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Um,\u2019 I said, then immediately regretting it, knowing this one utterance spoke volumes. \u2018He does. But she\u2019s actually really determined to do it on her own...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, please,\u2019 my mom said. I could hear her satisfaction. \u2018Nobody wants to be the sole caregiver of a newborn. And if they say they do, it\u2019s only because they don\u2019t really have a choice. Have you seen your father change a diaper?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sure he has.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, but, Auden.\u2019 I winced. This was like being painted into a corner, stroke by stroke. \u2018Have you seen it?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well,\u2019 I said. \u2018Not really.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Ah.\u2019 She exhaled again, and I could almost hear her smiling. \u2018Well, it\u2019s nice to know some things really never do change.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I wanted to point out that since this was what she was so sure of, she shouldn\u2019t have been surprised. Instead, I said, \u2018So how are you doing?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Me?\u2019 A sigh. \u2018Oh, the same old, same old. I\u2019ve been asked to head up the committee rewriting the English core courses for next year, with all the attendant drama that will entail. And I have several articles expected by various journals, my trip to Stratford coming up, and, of course, entirely too many dissertations that clearly cannot be completed without a large amount of hand-holding.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sounds like quite a summer,\u2019 I said, opening my window.</p><p>\u2018Tell me about it. These graduate students, I swear, it just never ends. They\u2019re all so needy.\u2019 She sighed again, and I thought of those black-rimmed glasses sitting on the counter-top. \u2018I have half a mind to decamp to the coast, like you, and spend the summer on the beach without a care in the world.\u2019</p> <p>I looked out the window at the water, the white sand, the Tip just visible beyond. Yep, I wanted to say. That\u2019s me exactly. \u2018So,\u2019 I said, thinking this, \u2018have you heard from Hollis lately?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Night before last,\u2019 she said. Then she laughed. \u2018He was telling me he met some Norwegians who were on their way to a convention in Amsterdam. They own some Internet start-up, and apparently they\u2019re very interested in Hollis, think he\u2019s really got his finger on the pulse of their American target audience, so he went along. He\u2019s thinking it could pan out into a position of some sort...\u2019</p><p>I rolled my eyes. Funny how my mom could see through me entirely, but Hollis takes off for Amsterdam with some people he just met, spins it into a career move, and she goes for it hook, line, and sinker. Honestly.</p><p>Just then, there was a knock on my door. When I opened it, I was surprised to see my dad standing there. \u2018Hey,\u2019 he said, smiling at me. \u2018We\u2019re heading out for some dinner, thought you might want to come along.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sure,\u2019 I mouthed, hoping my mother, who was still talking about Hollis, wouldn\u2019t hear.</p> <p>\u2018Auden?\u2019 No luck. Her voice was clear through the receiver, a fact made more apparent by the way my dad winced. \u2018Are you still there?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I am,\u2019 I told her. \u2018But Dad just came and invited me to dinner, so I better go.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh,\u2019 she said, \u2018so he\u2019s done with the tightening for the day?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll call you later,\u2019 I said quickly, shutting my phone and folding my hand around it.</p><p>My dad sighed. \u2018And how is your mother?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Fine,\u2019 I said. \u2018Let\u2019s go.\u2019</p> <p>Downstairs, Heidi was waiting for us, her own phone clamped to her ear, Thisbe strapped into her stroller. My dad opened the door, and she pushed the baby out as she kept talking. \u2018But that doesn\u2019t make sense! I did the payroll myself, and we had plenty of money in the account. It just... well, of course. The bank would know. I\u2019m terribly sorry, Esther, this is so embarrassing. Look, we\u2019re on our way down there right now. I\u2019ll get some cash from the ATM and we\u2019ll work all this out on Monday, okay?\u2019</p><p>My dad took a deep breath as we stepped outside. \u2018Gotta love that sea air!\u2019 he said to me, patting his hands on his chest. \u2018It\u2019s great for the soul.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re in a good mood,\u2019 I said as Heidi, still talking, eased the stroller down the front steps, and we started toward the street.</p><p>\u2018Ah, well, that\u2019s what a breakthrough can do for you,\u2019 he replied, reaching over Heidi\u2019s hands and taking the stroller handles from her. She smiled at him, stepping aside as he began to push Thisbe along. \u2018I\u2019d been really struggling with this middle chapter, just couldn\u2019t find my groove. But then, today, suddenly... it came together.\u2019 He snapped his fingers. \u2018Just like that! It\u2019s going to make all the ones to follow that much easier.\u2019</p><p>I glanced at Heidi, who was now saying something about bank fees, a worried look on her face. \u2018I thought you were mostly tightening,\u2019 I said to my dad.</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 he said, nodding at a man who was jogging past, plugged into his iPod. \u2018Oh, right. Well, it\u2019s all just a matter of fitting things together. A few more days like today, and I\u2019ll have this draft done by midsummer. At the latest.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Wow,\u2019 I said as Heidi shut her phone, then ran a hand through her hair. My dad reached over, grabbing her by the waist and pulling her closer, then planted a kiss on her cheek.</p><p>\u2018Isn\u2019t this great?\u2019 he said, smiling. \u2018All of us together, going for Thisbe\u2019s first trip to the Last Chance.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018It\u2019s wonderful,\u2019 Heidi agreed. \u2018But I actually need to stop at the shop on the way. There\u2019s apparently some problem with the payroll checks...\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s Friday night, honey!\u2019 my dad said. \u2018Just let it go. All that work stuff will still be there on Monday.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, but \u2013\u2019 Heidi replied as her phone rang again. She glanced at it, then put it to her ear. \u2018Hello? Leah, yes, what\u2019s... oh. No, I\u2019m aware of it. Look, are you at the branch just down from the shop? Okay, then just walk over and I\u2019ll meet you there. I\u2019m remedying it as we speak.\u2019</p><p>\u2018These girls she hires,\u2019 my dad said, nodding at Heidi. \u2018Typical teenagers. It\u2019s always something.\u2019</p><p>I nodded, as if I were not, in fact, a teenager myself. Then again, to my dad, I wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u2018Their paychecks bounced,\u2019 Heidi told him. \u2018It\u2019s kind of a serious situation.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Then call your accountant, let him deal with it,\u2019 he replied, making a goofy face down at Thisbe, who was drifting off to sleep. \u2018We\u2019re having family time.\u2019</p><p>\u2018He doesn\u2019t do payroll, I do,\u2019 Heidi said.</p><p>\u2018Well, then tell them to wait until we\u2019ve finished dinner.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I can\u2019t do that, Robert. They deserve to be paid, and \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Look,\u2019 my dad said, annoyed, \u2018weren\u2019t you the one who said I wasn\u2019t spending enough time with you and the baby and Auden? Who insisted that I stop working, and have a family dinner out?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Heidi said as her phone rang again. \u2018But \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018So I knock off early. On my best day yet, I might add,\u2019 he continued as we rolled up onto the boardwalk, \u2018and now you\u2019re not willing to do the same thing.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Robert, this is my business.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018And writing isn\u2019t mine?\u2019</p><p>Oh, boy, I thought. Change a few details \u2013 professorship for business, committees for employees \u2013 and this was the same fight he\u2019d had with my mom all those years ago. I glanced at Heidi: her face was stressed, as Clementine\u2019s now came into view, Esther and Leah standing outside together. \u2018Look,\u2019 she said to my dad, \u2018why don\u2019t you and Auden take the baby and get a table and I\u2019ll meet you there. This will only take a few minutes. Okay?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Fine,\u2019 my dad said, although clearly, it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t the only one not happy. Twenty minutes later, just as we were about to be seated at Last Chance, Thisbe woke up and started fussing. At first, it was a low, rumbling sort of crying, but then it began to escalate. By the time the hostess arrived and began to grab menus for us, she was pretty much screaming.</p> <p>\u2018Oh,\u2019 my dad said, moving the stroller forward and back. Thisbe kept wailing. \u2018Well. Auden, can you... ?\u2019</p><p>This was not followed by a verb, so I had no idea what he was asking. As Thisbe kept crying, though, now attracting the attention of pretty much everyone around us, he shot me another, more panicked look, and I realized he wanted me to jump in. Which was ridiculous. Even worse? I did it.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll take her,\u2019 I said, grabbing the stroller from him and backing it up to the door. \u2018Why don\u2019t you \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll sit down and order for us,\u2019 he said. \u2018Just bring her back in when she\u2019s calmed down, all right?\u2019</p><p>Of course. Because that was going to happen anytime soon.</p> <p>I wheeled her out onto the boardwalk, where at least the noise wasn\u2019t enclosed, then sat down on a bench beside her. I watched her face for a while, scrunched up and reddening, before glancing back into the restaurant. Past the hostess station, down a narrow aisle, I could see my dad, at a table for four, a menu spread out in front of him. I swallowed, then ran a hand over my face, closing my eyes.</p><p>People don\u2019t change, my mother had said, and of course she was right. My dad was still selfish and inconsiderate, and I was still not wanting to believe it, even when the proof was right in front of me. Maybe we were all destined to just keep doing the same stupid things, over and over again, never really learning a single thing. Beside me, Thisbe was now screaming, and I wanted to join in, sit back and open my mouth and let the years of frustration and sadness and everything else just spill forth into the world once and for all. But instead, I just sat there, silent, until I suddenly felt someone looking at me.</p><p>I opened my eyes, and there, standing next to the stroller in jeans, beat-up sneakers, and a faded T-shirt that said LOVE SHOVE across the front, was the guy I\u2019d seen at the Tip and the boardwalk. It was like he\u2019d appeared from nowhere and now was suddenly right there, studying Thisbe. As he did, I took the opportunity to do the same to him, taking in his tanned skin and green eyes, shoulder-length dark hair pulled back messily at the back of his neck, the thick, raised scar that ran up one forearm, forking at the elbow like a river on a map.</p><p>I had no idea why he was here, especially considering how he\u2019d blown me off the last time we\u2019d met, in this same place. But at that moment, I didn\u2019t have the energy to overthink. I said, \u2018She just started screaming.\u2019</p><p>He considered this but said nothing. Which for some reason, God only knew why, made me feel like I needed to keep talking.</p><p>\u2018She\u2019s always crying, actually,\u2019 I told him. \u2018It\u2019s colic, or just... I don\u2019t know what to do.\u2019</p> <p>Still, he was silent. Just like he\u2019d been that night at the Tip, and on the boardwalk. The sick part was that I knew he wouldn\u2019t answer, but still insisted on talking to him anyway. Which was so not like me, as I was the one who usually \u2013</p><p>\u2018Well,\u2019 he said suddenly, taking me by surprise yet again, \u2018there\u2019s always the elevator.\u2019</p><p>I just looked at him. \u2018The elevator?\u2019</p><p>In response, he bent down and unhitched Thisbe from the stroller. Before I could stop him \u2013 and I was pretty sure I should stop him \u2013 he\u2019d taken her out, lifting her up into his arms. My first thought was that this was the last thing I\u2019d expected him to do. The second was how amazingly at ease he seemed with her, more than me and my dad and even Heidi, combined.</p><p>\u2018This,\u2019 he said, turning her so she was facing out (still screaming, of course), his hands wrapped around her midsection, legs dangling down and kicking wildly, \u2018is the elevator.\u2019 And then he bent his legs, easing down, and straightened them, then repeated it, once, twice, three times. By the fourth, she abruptly stopped her protests, a weird look of calm spreading over her face.</p><p>I just stood there, looking at him. Who was this guy? Sullen stranger? Trick biker? Baby whisperer? Or \u2013</p><p>\u2018Eli!\u2019 Heidi said, suddenly appearing behind him. \u2018I thought that was you.\u2019</p><p>The guy glanced at her, then flushed, but only barely, and briefly. \u2018Hey,\u2019 he said, stopping the elevator. Thisbe blinked, then burst into tears.</p> <p>\u2018Oh, dear,\u2019 Heidi said, reaching out to take her from him. To me she said, \u2018Where\u2019s your father?\u2019</p><p>\u2018He got a table,\u2019 I told her. \u2018We were about to sit down when she started to freak out.\u2019</p><p>\u2018She\u2019s probably hungry,\u2019 Heidi said, glancing at her watch. Thisbe wailed louder, over her shoulder, while I glanced at the guy \u2013 Eli \u2013 trying to process what I\u2019d just seen. \u2018What a day! You would not believe the mess I have to deal with at work. The checkbook is all out of order, somehow I missed a deposit or something, thank God the girls are so understanding. I mean, it\u2019s not like their paychecks are for huge amounts, but still, they work hard, and...\u2019</p><p>Between this soliloquy and the baby melting down, not to mention Eli witnessing it all, I could literally feel my temperature rising. Why did she have to make everything such a big deal?</p><p>\u2018I better get back to the shop,\u2019 he said to Heidi. \u2018Congratulations, by the way.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, Eli, you\u2019re so sweet, thank you,\u2019 she replied, jiggling the baby. \u2018And I\u2019m so glad you met Auden! She\u2019s new here, hardly knows a soul, and I was hoping she\u2019d find someone to introduce her around.\u2019</p><p>I felt my face flush even hotter; of course she had to make it sound like I was desperate for company. Which was why I barely responded as Eli nodded at me before crossing the boardwalk and pushing the door open to the bike shop, disappearing inside. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Thisbe, sweetheart, it\u2019s okay,\u2019 Heidi was saying, oblivious to all this as she strapped the baby back into the stroller. To me she added, \u2018It\u2019s so great you and Eli are friends!\u2019</p><p>\u2018We\u2019re not,\u2019 I said. \u2018We don\u2019t even really know each other.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh.\u2019 She looked over at the bike shop, as if it would confirm this, then back at me. \u2018Well, he is really sweet. His brother, Jake, is about your age, I think. He went out with Maggie until just recently. Awful breakup, that was. She\u2019s still reeling from it.\u2019</p><p>His brother? I thought, my face flushing. How small was this freaking town, anyway? And Heidi was still talking.</p> <p>\u2018Should we go back to the restaurant?\u2019 she asked me. \u2018Or maybe I should take Thisbe home, she\u2019s so upset. What do you think? I mean, I\u2019d love a dinner out, but I wonder \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t,\u2019 I said, the words coming even as I knew I should bite them back, \u2018I don\u2019t know what you should do. Okay? All I know is that I\u2019m hungry, and I want to go eat with my father. So that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do, if it\u2019s all right with you.\u2019</p><p>I could see her draw in a breath as a hurt look spread across her face. \u2018Oh,\u2019 she said after a moment. \u2018Well, sure. Of course.\u2019</p><p>I knew I\u2019d been mean. I knew it, and yet I still turned and walked away, leaving her and the baby, still crying, behind me. But I could have sworn the sound followed me, hanging on, filling my ears even through the crowd on the boardwalk, into the restaurant, all the way down the narrow aisle to the table where my dad was already eating. He took a look at my face, then pushed a menu over to me as I slid into the booth across from him.</p><p>\u2018Just relax,\u2019 he said. \u2018It\u2019s Friday night.\u2019</p> <p>Right, I thought. Of course. And when the onion rings arrived a few minutes later, I tried to do just that. But for some reason, they didn\u2019t taste the same this time. Still good. But not great like before.</p><p>I knew from experience when a fight was over and when it had only just begun. So I stayed gone after dinner, taking a walk on the beach and the longest way home. Not long enough, though: as I climbed the porch steps two hours later, I could hear them.</p><p>\u2018\u2013 understand what you want from me. You asked me to stop working and come to dinner. I did that. And you\u2019re still not happy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I wanted us to all have dinner together!\u2019</p><p>\u2018And we would have, if you hadn\u2019t left to go to the store. That was your choice.\u2019</p><p>I dropped my hand from the doorknob, stepping back out of the porch light. From the sound of it, this was happening just inside, and the last thing I wanted was to walk into the middle of it.</p> <p>\u2018I just wish...\u2019 Heidi said, her voice cracking.</p><p>Then, nothing. The silence was almost unbearable, broken only when my dad said, \u2018You just wish what.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 she said. \u2018I just... I thought you\u2019d want to spend more time with us.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m here all the time, Heidi,\u2019 my dad said, his voice flat.</p><p>\u2018Yes, but you\u2019re in your office. You\u2019re not with Thisbe, interacting with her. You don\u2019t rock her or get up with her...\u2019</p><p>\u2018We discussed this as soon as you got pregnant,\u2019 my dad told her, his voice rising. \u2018I told you I cannot function on broken sleep, that I have to get my nine hours. You knew that.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Okay, but you could take her during the day, or in the morning so I could deal with work stuff. Or even \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Have we not discussed,\u2019 my dad said, \u2018how important it is that I finish the book this summer? That I can\u2019t do the work I need to do during the academic year, and this is my only chance to work uninterrupted?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Yes, of course, but \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Which is why,\u2019 he continued, talking over her, \u2018I said let\u2019s hire a nanny. Or a babysitter. But you didn\u2019t want to.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t need a nanny. I just need an hour here or there.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So ask Auden! Isn\u2019t that why you wanted her to come visit?\u2019</p><p>I literally felt like I\u2019d been slapped: my reaction was that visceral, blood rushing to my face.</p><p>\u2018I didn\u2019t invite Auden so she\u2019d babysit,\u2019 she said.</p><p>\u2018Then why is she here?\u2019</p><p>Another silence followed. This one I welcomed, though, as sometimes a question can hurt more than an answer. Finally Heidi said, \u2018For the same reason I want you to spend time with the baby. Because she\u2019s your daughter, and you should want to be with her.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, Jesus,\u2019 my dad said. \u2018Do you really think \u2013\u2019</p><p>There was more coming, of course there was. My dad never said a sentence when he could go on for a paragraph. But this time, I couldn\u2019t stand to hear it. So I dug my keys out of my pocket and got into my car.</p><p>I stayed gone for three hours, driving up and down the streets of Colby, circling up to the college, down to the pier, then back again. It was too small a place to really get lost in, but I did my best. And when I pulled back into the driveway, I made sure all the lights were out in the house before I even thought about going inside.</p><p>It was quiet as I stepped into the foyer, shutting the door behind me. At least there was no sign of major disturbances: the stroller was parked by the stairs, a burp cloth folded over the banister, my dad\u2019s keys sitting on the table by the door. The only thing different was the kitchen table, which was now piled with Heidi\u2019s business checkbook, various stacks of paper, and a couple of legal pads. On one of them, she\u2019d clearly been trying to figure out what had happened with accounts. \u2018WITHHOLDING?\u2019 she\u2019d written, as well as \u2018DEPOSIT 6-11?\u2019 and \u2018CHECK ALL DEBITS SINCE APRIL, ERRORS?\u2019 From the looks of it \u2013 messy, sort of desperate \u2013 she hadn\u2019t gotten very far.</p><p>Looking down at the mess of papers, I had a flash of her hurt face after I\u2019d snapped at her, as well as what she\u2019d said later to my dad about me. It was so unexpected to have her in my corner, defending me. Even more shocking was how grateful I\u2019d felt, if only fleetingly, to find her there.</p><p>I glanced at my watch: it was twelve fifteen, early by my clock, with a full night still ahead of me. And the coffeemaker was right there on the counter, already filled for the morning and ready to go. It wasn\u2019t Ray\u2019s, but it would do. So I turned, hitting the button, and as it began to brew, I sat down with Heidi\u2019s checkbook, flipping it open, and went looking for what she\u2019d lost. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter FIVE</p><p>\u2018Hey, Aud. It\u2019s me! What\u2019s going on?\u2019</p><p>My brother\u2019s voice, loud and cheerful, boomed through my cell phone, a loud bass beat behind it. I was sure that Hollis did spend some of his time in places other than bars, but he never seemed to call me from any of them.</p><p>\u2018Not much,\u2019 I said, glancing at my watch. It was eight thirty P.M. my time, which meant well past midnight at his. \u2018Just getting ready to go to work.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Work?\u2019 he said, saying the word like it was from another language. Which, to him, it sort of was. \u2018I thought you were supposed to be having a lazy summer, just hanging out at the beach.\u2019</p><p>I was sure it was no coincidence he\u2019d put it like this, almost verbatim the way my mother had described it during our last conversation: if Hollis was able to spin my mom\u2019s thinking any way he wanted, she had similar influence over his own. Their connection was almost eerie, really, a bond that was so strong you could almost feel it, like a tidal pull, when they were together. My mother claimed it was the result of all those nights they spent together when he was a baby, but I wondered if it was just that Hollis had a way with women, starting with the first one he\u2019d ever known.</p><p>\u2018Well,\u2019 I said now, as the music grew louder, then dropped off again behind him, \u2018I didn\u2019t plan on working, actually. It just sort of happened.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That sucks!\u2019 he said. \u2018Drop your guard, and stuff like that will sneak up on you. You gotta stay vigilant, you know?\u2019</p><p>I knew. In truth, though, this latest situation was no surprise. If anything, I\u2019d walked right into it, eyes wide open. I had no one to blame but myself.</p> <p>\u2018I can\u2019t believe it!\u2019 Heidi had said when I came down the day after I\u2019d worked on her books. As always, she was in the kitchen, lying in wait, the baby strapped to her in the Baby-Bj\u00f6rn. \u2018When I went to bed last night, this was all such a mess, and then this morning, it\u2019s... it\u2019s fixed. You\u2019re a miracle worker! How did you even know how to do all that?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I worked for an accountant last summer for a little while,\u2019 I told her, pulling the coffee out of the freezer. By the time I got up they\u2019d long ago rinsed out the pot, so I always got a fresh one, all mine. \u2018It was no big deal.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I spent two hours last night going over this checkbook register,\u2019 she said, picking it up and waving it at me. \u2018And I could not find the problem. How did you even know to consider double withholding?\u2019</p><p>I started the coffeemaker, wishing I could at least have a cup in me before having to converse with anyone. No chance of that, though.</p><p>\u2018The register indicated it happened last May,\u2019 I told her. \u2018So I just figured it might have again. And then when I went to look at the tax statements \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Which were such a mess, too, I couldn\u2019t find a thing in them!\u2019 she said. \u2018And now they\u2019re all organized. You must have spent hours getting all this stuff in order.\u2019</p> <p>Four, I thought. Out loud I said, \u2018No. I really didn\u2019t.\u2019</p><p>She just shook her head, watching me as the coffeemaker finally produced enough for a quarter of a cup, which I quickly poured into my mug. \u2018You know,\u2019 she said, \u2018I\u2019ve been needing to hire someone to help me with the books for months now, but I was hesitant, as it\u2019s such a sensitive job. I didn\u2019t want to give it to just anyone.\u2019</p><p>Oh, dear Lord, I thought. Please just let me drink my coffee.</p><p>\u2018But if you were interested,\u2019 she continued, \u2018I\u2019d make it worth your while. Seriously.\u2019</p><p>I was still waiting for the caffeine to hit as I said, \u2018Um, I wasn\u2019t really planning to work this summer. And I\u2019m not exactly a morning person...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, you wouldn\u2019t have to be, though!\u2019 she said. \u2018The girls do the deposit every day, and that\u2019s the only thing that has to be done by a certain time. The rest, like the books and the payroll and keeping track of the register take, you can do later in the day. It\u2019s actually better if you wait, really.\u2019</p><p>Of course it was. And now I was stuck, as clearly, no good deed went unpunished. The bigger issue, though, was what had inspired this sudden burst of Good Samaritan behavior on my part? Was it that hard to realize that it would never just stop with one thing, there would always be a next step expected, and then one beyond that?</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s a really nice offer,\u2019 I said to Heidi, \u2018but \u2013\u2019</p> <p>This thought was interrupted by the sound of footsteps behind me: a moment later, my dad rounded the corner, carrying an empty plate, a Diet Coke can balanced on top of it. When he saw Heidi, and she looked back at him, I knew instantly their argument from the night before had not been resolved. It wasn\u2019t exactly a chill in the air as much as a deep freeze.</p><p>\u2018Well,\u2019 he said to me, walking to the sink and putting his plate into it, \u2018I see you\u2019re finally awake. What time do you go to bed these days, anyway?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Late,\u2019 I told him. \u2018Or early, depending on how you look at it.\u2019</p><p>He nodded as he rinsed off the plate, sticking it in the dish rack. \u2018Ah, the ease of youth. Up all night, not a care in the world. I envy you.\u2019</p><p>Don\u2019t, I thought. Heidi said, \u2018Actually, Auden spent last night going over my books. She found the error that threw off my balance.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Really,\u2019 my dad said, glancing at me.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m trying to convince her to work for me,\u2019 Heidi added. \u2018Do a few hours a day in the office at the shop.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Heidi,\u2019 he said, rinsing off his hands, \u2018Auden\u2019s not here to work. Remember?\u2019</p><p>It was just one comment but crafted for maximum impact. And it delivered: I watched as Heidi winced. \u2018Of course not,\u2019 she said. \u2018I just thought that she might \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018She should be enjoying her time with her family,\u2019 he told her. Then he smiled at me. \u2018What do you say, Auden? How about you and me have dinner tonight?\u2019</p><p>He was good, my dad. I had to give him that. And so what if this was all about getting back at Heidi for the night before? It was exactly what I wanted, just me and him, and that was all that mattered. Wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>\u2018That sounds great,\u2019 Heidi said. When I looked at her, she smiled at me, although it seemed a little forced. \u2018And, look, don\u2019t worry about the job thing. Your dad\u2019s right, you should just be enjoying your summer.\u2019</p><p>My dad was taking a last sip of his Diet Coke, watching her as she said this. It had been a while since I\u2019d had to listen to my parents fight, but no matter. Same tension, same barbs. Same look on my dad\u2019s face when he knew he\u2019d won. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Actually,\u2019 I said, speaking before I even really realized what I was doing, \u2018I could use some extra money for school. As long as it wasn\u2019t too many hours.\u2019</p><p>Heidi looked surprised, then glanced at my dad \u2013 whose expression could best be described as annoyed \u2013 before saying, \u2018Oh, it wouldn\u2019t be! Just, like, fifteen a week. If that.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Auden,\u2019 my dad said. \u2018Don\u2019t feel obligated. You\u2019re here as our guest.\u2019</p><p>I knew that if I hadn\u2019t heard their argument the night before, this entire exchange would have been different. But you can\u2019t unlearn something, even if you want to. You know what you know.</p> <p>Later that evening, my dad and I walked up the boardwalk to a place right on the pier, where we ordered a pound of steamed shrimp and sat looking over the water. I wasn\u2019t sure if it was that I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about what he\u2019d said, or that he was still annoyed at me taking Heidi\u2019s offer (and, in his mind at least, side), but at first it was a little stiff, awkward. After he had a beer and we both endured some very dull conversation, though, things loosened up, with him asking me about Defriese and my plans for my major. In turn, I got him to talk about his book (\u2018an intricate study of a man trying to escape his family\u2019s past\u2019) and the progress he was making (he\u2019d had to tear out the middle, it just wasn\u2019t working, but the new stuff was much, much better). It took a while, but somewhere between the second pound of shrimp and his detailed explanation about his character\u2019s inner conflict, I was reminded of everything I loved about my dad: his passion for his work, and the way, when he was talking to you about it, it was like there was no one else in the room, or even the world.</p><p>\u2018I can\u2019t wait to read it,\u2019 I told him as the waitress dropped off our check. Between us there was a huge mound of shrimp shells, translucent and pink in the sunlight slanting through the window. \u2018It sounds great.\u2019</p><p>\u2018See, you understand how important all this is,\u2019 he said, wiping his mouth. \u2018You were there when Narwhal came out, and saw how its success changed our lives. This could do the same for me and the baby and Heidi. I just wish she could see that.\u2019 He was studying his beer bottle as he said this, turning it in his hand.</p><p>\u2018Well, it could be she\u2019s just emotional right now. Sleep deprivation and all that.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Maybe.\u2019 He took a sip. \u2018But in truth, she doesn\u2019t think like we do, Auden. Her strength is business, which is all about results, very calculating. It\u2019s different with academics and writers. You know that.\u2019</p> <p>I did know that. But I also knew that my mother, who fit both of these categories, had felt the exact same way about his efforts with this exact same novel. Still, it was nice to know he felt like he could confide in me.</p><p>After dinner, we parted ways and I headed toward Clementine\u2019s, where I\u2019d told Heidi I\u2019d look over the office and get my bearings before officially starting work the next day. I wasn\u2019t exactly looking forward to it, for any number of reasons, so I was actually grateful for once for the distraction that was my brother.</p><p>\u2018So,\u2019 I said to him now as the music began to thump again, \u2018Tara\u2019s nice.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Who?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Tara,\u2019 I repeated. \u2018Your girlfriend?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, right.\u2019 There was a pointed pause, which pretty much answered any lingering questions I might have asked. Then, \u2018So you got your present, huh?\u2019</p> <p>I could see the picture frame, which was in my duffel bag, instantly in my mind, those words beneath his grinning face: THE BEST OF TIMES. \u2018Yeah,\u2019 I said to Hollis. \u2018It\u2019s great. I love it.\u2019</p><p>He chuckled. \u2018Come on, Aud. You do not.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I do.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, you don\u2019t. It\u2019s totally tacky.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well,\u2019 I said. \u2018It\u2019s \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Horrible,\u2019 he finished for me. \u2018Cheap and ridiculous. Probably the stupidest graduation gift ever, which is exactly why I gave it to you.\u2019 He laughed, that booming, Hollis guffaw that, despite myself, always made me want to laugh, too. \u2018Look, I figured there was no way I could compete with all the money and savings bonds and new cars you\u2019d be getting from everyone else. So I decided at least my offering should be memorable.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It is that,\u2019 I agreed.</p><p>\u2018You should have seen the others!\u2019 Another laugh. \u2018They had them with all kinds of sayings. One was HELLO FRIEND! in bright yellow. Also, PARTY QUEEN, in pink. And then there was the one that said, inexplicably, in green, CRAZY PERSON. Like anyone would want their picture in that.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Only you,\u2019 I said.</p><p>\u2018No kidding!\u2019 He snorted. \u2018Anyway, I figured the cool thing was that you could keep switching out the picture. Because you don\u2019t want THE BEST OF TIMES to be just one thing, forever. You have to have a lot of bests of times, each one topping the last. You know?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah,\u2019 I said. And just like that, he\u2019d done it again: taken a thought he\u2019d probably come to on the fly, under any number of influences, and somehow managed to make it deep enough to resonate. It was an art, what Hollis did. Never calculating, but it did have its charms. \u2018I miss you,\u2019 I said to him.</p><p>\u2018I miss you, too,\u2019 he replied. \u2018Hey, look, I\u2019ll send a CRAZY PERSON frame. You can put that picture of me in it, set it next to you in THE BEST OF TIMES, and it\u2019ll almost be like we\u2019re together. What do you think?\u2019</p><p>I smiled. \u2018It\u2019s a deal.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Cool!\u2019 There was a muffled noise, followed by loud voices. \u2018Okay, Aud, I gotta run. Ramona and me are headed to a party. Talk soon, though, okay?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sure,\u2019 I said. \u2018Let\u2019s \u2013\u2019</p><p>But then he was gone, just like that. Before I could ask him who exactly Ramona was, or what had happened in Amsterdam. That was my brother, the living, breathing To Be Continued. Like my dad\u2019s book, he was always in progress.</p><p>I shut my phone, then slid it back into my pocket. Hollis was a great distraction, but any regret I\u2019d been feeling about taking the job came rushing back as soon as I opened the door to Clementine\u2019s and saw Maggie standing at the register, Leah and Esther on either side of her. There is really nothing more intimidating than approaching a group of girls who have already made up their minds about you. It\u2019s like walking a plank, no way to go but down.</p><p>\u2018Hello,\u2019 Leah, the redhead, said as I came toward them. She was one of those tall, curvy types with milky white skin and was wearing a low-cut sundress and strappy heels. Her voice was neither kind nor unkind, just sort of level as she said, \u2018What can we do for you?\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018She\u2019s going to be doing the books,\u2019 Maggie told her, although her eyes were on me. When I looked back at her, though, she flushed, turning her gaze to some papers on the counter in front of her, shuffling them busily. \u2018Heidi\u2019s been looking for someone since the baby came, remember?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, right,\u2019 Leah said. She pushed back from the counter, hopping up on the one behind her, and folded her long legs. \u2018Well, maybe now our checks won\u2019t bounce.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No kidding,\u2019 Esther said. Her pigtails were gone, her hair loose and topped with an army-style cap, which she was wearing with a black sundress, a denim jacket thrown over it, and flip-flops. \u2018I mean, I love Heidi. But getting paid at the ATM is kind of sketchy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You did get paid, though. Heidi\u2019s a good boss; it was an honest mistake,\u2019 Maggie said. Now she was making a studied point of not looking at me as she hit a button on the register, then pulled out a stack of bills, straightening them. Again, she was dressed in pink \u2013 both her shirt and flip-flops \u2013 and I wondered if this was some kind of signature thing with her. I bet it was. \u2018Anyway, someone\u2019s supposed to show her around.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Who?\u2019 Leah asked. \u2018Heidi?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019 Maggie shut the drawer, then looked at me. A moment later, Leah and Esther both followed suit. Clearly, I\u2019d reached the end of that plank. Nothing to do but jump.</p><p>\u2018Auden,\u2019 I said.</p><p>A pause. Then Leah pushed herself off the counter, dropping her feet to the floor with a clunk. \u2018Come on,\u2019 she said over her shoulder. \u2018The office is this way.\u2019</p><p>I could feel the other girls watching me as I followed her past a couple of racks of jeans, a shoe display, and a clearance section to a narrow hallway. \u2018That\u2019s the bathroom,\u2019 she said, nodding at a door on the left. \u2018Not for customer use, ever, it\u2019s the rule. And here\u2019s the office. Stand back, the door kind of sticks.\u2019</p> <p>She reached for the knob, then pushed herself against it. A second later, I heard a pop! and it swung open.</p><p>The first thing I saw was pink. All four walls were painted a rosy, almost bubble-gummy shade of Maggie\u2019s favorite color. What wasn\u2019t pink (which, at first glance, didn\u2019t seem like much) was orange. Adding to the insanity, the very small space was jammed with all kinds of girly little touches: pink stacking bins, a Hello Kitty pencil cup, a bowl filled entirely with lipsticks and lip glosses. Even the filing cabinets \u2013 the filing cabinets! \u2013 had pink and orange labels, and a pink feather boa was stretched out over across the top of them.</p><p>\u2018Wow,\u2019 I said, unable to keep my silence.</p><p>\u2018I know,\u2019 Leah agreed. \u2018It\u2019s like being in a Starburst box. So, the safe is under the desk, the checkbook lives in the second left-hand drawer, when it\u2019s here, and all the invoices go under the bear.\u2019</p><p>\u2018The bear?\u2019</p><p>She stepped inside the room, walked to the desk, and picked up a little stuffed pink bear. Wearing an orange hat. \u2018Here,\u2019 she said, pointing to the stack of paper beneath him. \u2018Don\u2019t ask me, it was like that when I got hired. Any questions?\u2019</p> <p>Of course, I had several, but none she could answer. \u2018No. Thanks.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sure thing. Just holler if you need us.\u2019 She stepped past me, back into the hallway, where I was still standing, having not yet had the strength to actually venture inside. I heard her take a few steps before she said, \u2018And, Auden?\u2019</p><p>I turned, facing her. \u2018Yeah?\u2019</p><p>She glanced over her shoulder, then took one step back toward me. \u2018Don\u2019t worry about Maggie. She\u2019s just... emotional. She\u2019ll get over it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh,\u2019 I said, wondering how, exactly, I was supposed to respond to this. Even I knew better than to talk about one girl with another one, especially if they were friends. \u2018Right.\u2019</p><p>She nodded, then walked away, back to the register, where Esther and Maggie were now bent over a box, sticking price tags onto sunglasses. As she approached, they glanced up at her, then easily adjusted themselves, making room for her to join them.</p><p>I looked back into the pink room, and for some reason thought of my mother, if only because she was the only person I knew who would have had more trouble entering it than I did. I could just imagine her face, how her eyes would narrow in disgust, the heavy, through-the-nostril sigh that would speak louder than the words that followed it. \u2018It\u2019s like a womb in here!\u2019 she\u2019d groan. \u2018An environment totally ruled by gender stereotypes and expectations, as pathetic as those who chose to inhabit it.\u2019</p><p>Exactly, I thought. Then I went inside.</p> <p>Heidi\u2019s office might have been over the top, but her books were actually in pretty good shape. When I\u2019d worked for my mom\u2019s accountant the summer before, I\u2019d seen some crazy bookkeeping methods. There were people who came in with registers where entire months\u2019 worth of checks were missing, others who only seemed to keep their receipts on match-books or napkins. Heidi\u2019s stuff was organized, her files made sense, and there were only a few discrepancies, all of which had happened in the last ten months or so. Maybe this shouldn\u2019t have been a surprise to me, considering what my dad had said about her business background. But it was.</p><p>Not shocking was the fact that at first, the office was completely distracting. I actually felt a little nauseated, sitting there, a condition exacerbated when I turned on the desk lamp, which had an orange shade and made everything seem even more radioactive. But after a few minutes with the calculator and the checkbook, it all just kind of fell away. I hadn\u2019t realized how much I missed the simplicity of a project of numbers, how things just made sense in sums and division. No emotion, no complications. Just digits on-screen, lining up in perfect sequence.</p><p>I was so immersed, in fact, that at first I didn\u2019t even hear the music coming from the store behind me. It was only when it suddenly got very loud, like someone had twisted the volume from the lowest to highest setting, that it broke through the tax forms I was looking at and got my attention.</p><p>I looked at the clock \u2013 it was 9:01 \u2013 then pushed my chair back and eased the door open. Out in the hallway, the music was positively deafening, some disco song with a fast beat, a girl\u2019s voice chanting some lyrics about a summer crush over it. I was wondering if maybe they were having some issue with the stereo system when I saw Esther suddenly go shimmying past the jeans display, her arms waving over her head. She was followed, moments later, by Leah, doing a slow, hip-swiveling move, and then Maggie, bouncing on her tiptoes. It was like a conga line of three, passing quickly, then gone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I took another step forward, leaning out a bit more into the store. I couldn\u2019t see any customers, although the boardwalk looked crowded, lots of people passing by. I\u2019d just decided to go back to the office and wait for the silence to return when Esther popped up from behind the bathing-suit rack, this time doing a step-slide, step-slide move, her hair swinging out to the side. She reached out a hand to Leah, pulling her into view, then spinning her out and back toward her as they both laughed. Then they split, and Maggie moved in between them, shaking her hips as they circled around her, still dancing.</p><p>I didn\u2019t realize I was standing there just staring at them until Esther saw me. \u2018Hey,\u2019 she called out. Her cheeks were flushed. \u2018It\u2019s the nine o\u2019clock dance. Come on.\u2019</p><p>Instinctively, I shook my head. \u2018No thanks.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You can\u2019t say no,\u2019 Leah yelled as she grabbed Maggie\u2019s hand, then spun her out and back again. \u2018Employee participation is mandatory.\u2019</p> <p>Then I quit, I thought, but already they were moving on, back to the conga line, this time with Maggie in the lead, bouncing up and down, Esther snapping her fingers behind her. Leah, bringing up the rear, glanced back at me one last time. When I didn\u2019t say or do anything, she just shrugged, following the others as they wound around the displays, and headed toward the door.</p><p>I went back to the office, sitting down at the desk. I was sure they thought I was a total stick-in-the-mud, not that I cared. It was just like all the activities I\u2019d walked past at my old schools during lunch \u2013 fake sumo wrestling, pie-eating contests, mass games of Twister on the quad \u2013 always wondering how, exactly, you did stuff like that. Maybe if you\u2019d done it as a kid, it was all nostalgia, and that was the appeal. But I hadn\u2019t. It was all new to me, and therefore more intimidating than anything else.</p><p>I picked up my pen, going back to my 1099s. A moment later, the music stopped, as suddenly as it had begun. Another hour passed, in the silence of numbers, and then there was a tap on the door.</p><p>\u2018Closing time,\u2019 Esther said as she came in behind me, a bank bag in one hand. \u2018Can I get in the safe?\u2019</p><p>I pushed out my chair, making room as she dropped down to a squat, sticking the key she was holding into the lock. I watched as she put the bag in, then swung the door shut before pushing herself up again.</p> <p>\u2018We\u2019ll be out of here in about ten minutes,\u2019 she told me, brushing off her knees. \u2018You coming with us, or staying late?\u2019</p><p>I wanted to tell her that, to me, after ten wasn\u2019t late. But I knew she wasn\u2019t really looking to make conversation, so I said, \u2018I\u2019m almost done.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Cool. Just come out front and we can lock up when we\u2019re all out.\u2019</p><p>I nodded. She left the door open behind her, so as I finished up the last few things I had going, I could hear her and Maggie and Leah, out by the register chattering.</p><p>\u2018Where did these Skittles come from?\u2019 Esther asked.</p><p>\u2018Where do you think?\u2019 Leah told her.</p> <p>\u2018Really.\u2019 I could tell by her voice, slightly teasing, that Esther was smiling. \u2018So, Mags. More candy from Adam, huh?\u2019</p><p>Maggie sighed. \u2018I told you guys, it means nothing. He\u2019s a store-goer, just like all those boys.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That may be true,\u2019 Leah said, \u2018but just because he goes to the store doesn\u2019t mean he has to buy something for you every time.\u2019</p><p>\u2018He doesn\u2019t do it every time,\u2019 Maggie grumbled.</p><p>\u2018Sure seems like it,\u2019 Esther said. \u2018And with a store-goer boy, that is the first sign, anyway. It\u2019s how you know.\u2019</p><p>\u2018True,\u2019 Leah agreed.</p><p>\u2018Not true,\u2019 Maggie said. \u2018It\u2019s just candy. Stop reading so much into it. You guys are ridiculous.\u2019</p><p>I could second that. It amazed me that they\u2019d been together all night, and yet they still, seemingly, had something to talk about. Even if it was, predictably, candy and boys.</p> <p>When I came out, they were all by the front door, waiting for me. \u2018I understand if you don\u2019t want to get involved with him,\u2019 Leah was saying. \u2018I mean, he is a high school boy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018He graduated just like we did, Leah,\u2019 Esther told her.</p><p>\u2018True. But he\u2019s not a college boy yet. There\u2019s a big difference in that one summer.\u2019</p><p>\u2018How would you know? You refuse to date anyone but college guys.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why does that bother you so much? I mean, in college, we\u2019ll all be dating college boys anyway. So what\u2019s the harm in starting early?\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s not that it\u2019s harmful,\u2019 Esther replied as we all filed out, Maggie swinging the door shut and pulling out her keys. \u2018I just think that maybe you missed something, you know, by refusing to date anyone your own age.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What would I have missed?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019 Esther shrugged. \u2018There is something kind of nice about having the age thing in common.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Says the person who hasn\u2019t dated in over a year,\u2019 Leah said.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m choosy,\u2019 Esther told her.</p><p>\u2018Picky,\u2019 Maggie said. \u2018Nobody is good enough for you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I have high standards. It\u2019s better than dating just anyone.\u2019</p><p>There was a sudden, awkward pause, noticeable enough that even I felt it. Maggie, putting her keys in the door, stiffened. Esther said, \u2018Oh, Mags. You know I didn\u2019t mean Jake.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Okay, okay,\u2019 Maggie said, shaking her off. \u2018Let\u2019s not even talk about it.\u2019</p><p>This wouldn\u2019t be easy, though, as I realized when I looked to my right, to the bike shop, where I saw the curly-headed guy, sitting on a bike and talking to two boys I didn\u2019t recognize. Right behind him, pulling a jacket over his shoulders, was Jake. When he turned, he looked right at me.</p><p>Great, I thought, hurriedly turning my back, which left me facing Esther and Leah, who were trying to decide where to go from here. \u2018There\u2019s always the Tip,\u2019 Esther was saying. \u2018I heard something about a keg there tonight.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I am so tired of the sand and flat beer.\u2019 Leah groaned. \u2018Let\u2019s go to a club or something.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re the only one with an ID, remember?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I can get you guys in.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You always say that,\u2019 Esther told her. \u2018You never can. Mags, what do you want to do?\u2019</p><p>Maggie shrugged, dropping her keys into the bag she had slung over her shoulder. \u2018I don\u2019t care,\u2019 she said. \u2018I might just go home.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Leah shot a glance at Jake, then at me. \u2018Nonsense. Let\u2019s at least \u2013\u2019</p><p>This thought was interrupted by the curly-headed guy, who suddenly rode up right beside us, braking to a stop with a screech. \u2018Ladies,\u2019 he said. Leah rolled her eyes. \u2018Anyone want a ride to the jump park?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, God help us,\u2019 Leah said. \u2018Please, no more nights involving bicycles. What are we, twelve?\u2019</p><p>\u2018They\u2019re not just bicycles,\u2019 the guy said, offended. \u2018How can you even say that?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Easily,\u2019 she replied. \u2018And anyway, Adam \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll go,\u2019 Maggie said, interrupting her. Adam smiled, then sat back on his seat as she climbed onto the handlebars, arranging her purse in her lap. \u2018What?\u2019 she said to Leah, who sighed. \u2018It\u2019s better than some club.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Leah said flatly, \u2018it really isn\u2019t.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, lighten up,\u2019 Adam told her as he pushed off the boardwalk, starting to pedal. Maggie leaned back, closing her eyes, and then they were on their way, the other guys on bikes in front of the shop following behind them. Leah shook her head, annoyed, but allowed Esther to link her arm in hers as they brought up the rear on foot. Which left just me and Jake.</p><p>I tried to turn and start for home, but no luck. Two steps in and he was beside me. \u2018So,\u2019 he said, \u2018what was all that about the other night, anyway? You took off awfully fast.\u2019</p> <p>He was too everything: too confident, standing too close, wanting too much. I said, \u2018It wasn\u2019t about anything.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh,\u2019 he said, his voice low, \u2018I think it was. And could still be. You want to take a walk, or something?\u2019</p><p>It was all I could do not to cringe. I\u2019d already regretted what we\u2019d done, and that was before he was Maggie\u2019s ex and Eli\u2019s brother. And how strange was it that I, who wanted to know as little as possible about anything here, now knew all this?</p><p>\u2018Look,\u2019 I said to him. \u2018What happened the other night was a mistake, okay?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re calling me a mistake?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I have to go,\u2019 I told him, and started to walk away.</p> <p>\u2018You\u2019re messed up, you know that?\u2019 he said as I ducked my head down, focusing on the end of the boardwalk. \u2018Freaking tease!\u2019</p><p>More steps, more space. I\u2019d just stepped off the boardwalk onto the street, and finally let myself sort of relax, when I saw Eli up ahead, coming toward me. He was walking slowly behind a group of older women dressed for a night out, all of them too tan and wearing bright colors. I tried to make myself too small to be seen, but just as he passed me, he looked over. Please just move along, I thought, fixing my gaze tightly on the plaid shirt of the guy walking in front of me.</p><p>But Eli was clearly different from his brother, in that he took direction well. No words shouted, nothing said. In fact, he didn\u2019t even look at me twice, just walked on.</p><p>Chapter SIX</p><p>\u2018Auden? Have you...\u2019</p><p>I stopped. Listened. Waited. But, as usual, nothing followed this but silence.</p><p>Sighing, I put down my econ textbook, stood up, and opened my bedroom door. Sure enough, there was Heidi, Thisbe in her arms, looking at me with a perplexed expression.</p><p>\u2018Oh, for God\u2019s sake,\u2019 she said. \u2018I had a concrete reason why I came up here! And now, I have no idea what it was. Can you even believe that?\u2019</p> <p>I could. In fact, Heidi\u2019s forgetfulness had become as much a part of my routine as my morning coffee and late, late nights. I had done the best I could to keep myself segregated, my own life in Colby as separate from hers and my dad\u2019s as possible, considering we were living under the same roof. But it was no use. Two weeks in, and I was hopelessly intertwined, whether I liked it or not.</p><p>Because of this, I was now fully aware of the fact that my dad\u2019s mood depended entirely on how his writing went that day: a good morning, and he was cheerful the rest of the day, a bad one and he skulked around, sullen and muttering. I knew all the ups and downs of Heidi\u2019s ongoing postpartum issues, such as the forgetfulness, insane mood swings, and how she worried on multiple, complex levels about every freaking thing the baby did, from sleeping to eating to pooping. I was even fully versed in Thisbe\u2019s dayto-day life, from the crying (which was ongoing, it seemed) to her tendency to get the hiccups right when she was finally falling asleep. Maybe they were equally aware of me, as well, but I doubted it.</p><p>Because of all this, I\u2019d actually come to kind of enjoy \u2013 sometimes even crave \u2013 the few hours I spent at Clementine\u2019s every day. It was a chance to do something concrete, with a beginning, middle, and end. No wild emotional swings, no wondering aloud about someone else\u2019s bathroom habits, and no hiccuping. The only thing that kept it from being perfect was its close proximity to Esther, Leah, and Maggie and all their various dramatics. But at least they left me alone when my door was shut.</p><p>Now, I looked at Heidi, who was still standing there, her brow furrowed as she tried to remember why she\u2019d come upstairs. Thisbe, in her arms, was awake and staring up at the ceiling, most likely debating when she wanted to start screaming again. \u2018Did it have something to do with work?\u2019 I asked her, as I\u2019d learned that a few prompts could sometimes trigger her memory.</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 she said, shifting Thisbe to her other arm. \u2018I was downstairs, and thinking that I had to get the baby down for a nap soon, but it\u2019s been so hard because she\u2019s been switching it up so much, so no matter what I do she gets overtired...\u2019</p><p>I tuned out and began mentally reviewing the periodic table, which usually kept me occupied during these soliloquies.</p><p>\u2018... so I was going to try to put her down, but then I didn\u2019t, because...\u2019 She snapped her fingers. \u2018The wave machine! That\u2019s what it was. I can\u2019t find it. Have you seen it around?\u2019</p><p>I was about to say no. Two weeks ago, when I\u2019d first arrived, I would have, with no guilt or even a second thought. But thanks to the intertwining, I said, \u2018I think it might be on that table by the front door.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh! Wonderful.\u2019 She sighed, looking down at Thisbe, who was yawning. \u2018Well, I\u2019ll just go grab it and we\u2019ll hope for the best. I mean, yesterday I tried to put her down at this same time, she was clearly exhausted, but of course the minute I did she started up. I swear, it\u2019s like...\u2019</p><p>I began easing the door shut, slowly, slowly, until at last she got the hint, stepping back and turning toward the stairs. \u2018... so wish us luck!\u2019 she was saying, when I finally heard the knob click. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I sat down on my bed, looking out at the beach below. There were a lot of things about being here that I did not understand. And I was okay with that. But the wave machine? It drove me nuts.</p><p>Here we were, mere feet from the real, actual ocean, and yet Heidi was convinced that Thisbe could only sleep with the sound of manufactured waves \u2013 turned up to the highest setting, no less \u2013 supplied by her noise machine. Which meant that I had to hear them all night long as well. It probably would not have been that big a deal, if it hadn\u2019t made it impossible to hear the real sea. So I was there, in a beachfront house, listening to a fake ocean, and this just seemed to sum up everything that was wrong with this situation from start to finish.</p><p>Outside, I heard footsteps again, then a door opening and shutting. A moment later, sure enough, the waves began. Fake, loud, and endless.</p><p>I stood up, grabbing my bag, and stepped out into the hallway, moving past Thisbe\u2019s barely open door as quietly as I could. At the top of the stairs, I paused, looking into my dad\u2019s study, the door to which he always kept slightly ajar. He was at his desk, facing the wall, as usual, a Diet Coke can and a whole apple next to him. So it had been a good day.</p> <p>Like I said, I\u2019d become versed in my dad\u2019s habits. And by using my talents of observation, I\u2019d figured out that he took an apple up to his office every day after lunch. If it was a good day, he always got too immersed in what he was doing and didn\u2019t eat it. On a bad one, though, the core was bitten down to nothing, nibbled to death, sometimes even in two pieces. On a whole-apple day, he emerged at dinnertime cheerful and talkative. On an apple-core day \u2013 especially a two-piece core \u2013 you did best to steer clear, if he even came down at all.</p><p>Most days, though, I wasn\u2019t around for dinner anyway, as I left at five or so to head to Clementine\u2019s, where I grabbed a sandwich as I worked until closing. After that, I usually walked the boardwalk for an hour or so before coming home to get my car and taking off for another three or four.</p><p>I\u2019d found one all-night place, called the Wheelhouse Diner, about thirty-five miles away, but it was no Ray\u2019s. The booths were narrow and stank like bleach, and the coffee was watery. Plus, the waitresses all dirty-looked you if you stayed longer than it took to eat whatever you ordered, even though the place was usually deserted. So more often than not, I\u2019d just stop at the Gas/Gro, the closest convenience store, buy a big travel cup of coffee, and sip it as I drove around. In just two weeks, I knew about every inch of Colby backward and forward, for all the good that would do me.</p><p>By the time I got to Clementine\u2019s, it was almost six, and the shift was about to change. Which meant technically that Esther was done and Maggie was coming on, although more often than not \u2013 and for reasons I did not understand \u2013 whoever was leaving usually still hung around, unpaid, by choice. Then again, hanging around seemed to be all anyone did in Colby. The girls gathered at Clementine\u2019s, crowding the register and gossiping, flipping though fashion magazines, while the boys were on the benches in front of the bike shop, gossiping and reading bike magazines. It was ridiculous. And yet it went on, every day, all day long.</p><p>\u2018Hey there,\u2019 Esther, who was the friendliest of all of the girls, called out to me when I came in. \u2018How\u2019s it going?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Good,\u2019 I said, my standard reply. I\u2019d long ago resolved to be cordial but not overly so, lest I be sucked into some conversation about what celebrity was in rehab or strap versus strapless dresses. \u2018Any shipments in today?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Just these.\u2019 She picked up a couple of slips of paper, handing them off to me as I passed. \u2018Oh, we got an extra roll of quarters at the bank today for some reason, and I put the deposit slip under the bear.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Great. Thanks.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No problem.\u2019</p><p>A minute later, I was in the office, door shut, all alone. Just how I liked it. If only the walls had been a cool white, everything would have been perfect.</p><p>Usually, my focus on my work allowed me to tune out anything that was going on out in the store. But occasionally, as I switched tasks, I\u2019d hear bits here and there. When Leah was working, she was always on her cell phone. Esther seemed to spend a lot of time humming and singing to herself. And Maggie: well, Maggie was always talking to the customers.</p> <p>\u2018Oh, those look great,\u2019 I heard her say around seven thirty as I started on the payroll for the week. \u2018Petunia\u2019s are the best jeans, I swear. I live in mine.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 a girl\u2019s voice replied. \u2018I like the pockets on these, but I\u2019m not sure about the wash.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It is a little dark.\u2019 A pause. \u2018But at the same time, I think it\u2019s always good to have one pair of jeans you can always dress up, you know? And a dark wash guarantees that. Not all jeans look good with heels. But those will.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, totally. But if the wash worries you, we can pull a few other brands. The pockets on the Pink Slingbacks are great. And then there\u2019s always the Courtney Amandas. They\u2019re, like, magic for your butt.\u2019</p><p>The girl laughed. \u2018Then I definitely need to try them.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Done. Let me just find your size...\u2019</p><p>I rolled my eyes at no one, punching a few numbers into the calculator. Every time I overheard her going on in such detail about stuff like this, the nuances of different brands of flip-flops, or the pros and cons of boy shorts versus bikini bottoms, it seemed like such a waste. Here you had the capability to know so much about so many things, and you chose shoes and clothes. Leah at least seemed smart, while Esther, who clearly followed her own beat, was an individual. But Maggie was just... well, she was just like Heidi. A girl\u2019s girl, all the way, all pink and fluff and frivolity. Even worse, she was happy about it.</p> <p>\u2018Here they are!\u2019 I heard her say now. \u2018Oh, and I grabbed a pair of these great Dapper wedges we just got in, so you could see how they do with a bit more formal look.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Thanks,\u2019 the customer said. \u2018These look great. I love shoes.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Of course you do!\u2019 Maggie replied. \u2018You\u2019re human, aren\u2019t you?\u2019</p><p>For God\u2019s sake, I thought. Where was the wave machine when you really needed it?</p><p>A little while later, I heard the front door chime. A moment later, the music cranked up, this time a loud, thumping dance beat. I didn\u2019t even have to look at my watch. By this point, I knew the nine o\u2019clock dance when I heard it.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It happened each night, an hour before closing, regardless of whether there was only one employee or all three present, and always lasted exactly the length of one song, no longer. I didn\u2019t know how the customers reacted, although I could remember how I had, which was why I made sure to stay in the office.</p><p>From about 9:03 to ten, there were always a few more customers and a lot of idle chatter, usually concerning plans for the night or the lack thereof. Again, I tried to make it a point not to listen, but sometimes this was impossible, which was why I now knew that Leah always wanted to go out to the clubs (better chances of meeting older boys they hadn\u2019t known all their lives), while Esther preferred to go hear music (apparently she had some sort of singer-songwriter bent). Maggie, from what I could tell, didn\u2019t do much other than hang out with the boys from the bike shop, most likely pining after Jake, although she swore up and down she was over him, so over him.</p><p>This night was no different, as became clear when I heard Leah say, \u2018So, it\u2019s Ladies in Free at Tallyho tonight.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What was it,\u2019 Esther said, \u2018that we swore the last time we went there?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018We didn\u2019t \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, no, no to Tallyho,\u2019 Maggie recited over her.</p><p>Someone snickered. Then Leah said, \u2018I don\u2019t understand what is it you guys hate so much about that place.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Everything?\u2019 Esther said.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s better than going to open mike night at Ossify and watching some guy recite his shopping list over a drum-beat.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 Maggie said. \u2018Is it really?\u2019</p><p>More snickering. \u2018Look,\u2019 Esther said, \u2018I\u2019m not saying we have to go to Ossify. I just don\u2019t feel like getting grinded on by some drunk tourist again tonight.\u2019</p><p>\u2018There\u2019s always the jump park,\u2019 Maggie said. Loud groans. \u2018What? It\u2019s free, there are boys there...\u2019</p><p>\u2018The boys we\u2019ve known all our freaking lives,\u2019 Leah said.</p><p>\u2018... and it\u2019s fun,\u2019 Maggie finished. \u2018Plus, I heard Eli might be riding this weekend.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019d been adding up a long list of numbers, and at just this moment lost track of the last one I\u2019d punched in. I hit clear, and started over.</p> <p>\u2018That rumor,\u2019 Leah said, \u2018goes around every week.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Maybe, but this time I heard it from Adam.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Who heard it from Eli?\u2019 No answer from Maggie. \u2018Exactly my point. It\u2019s like a Bigfoot sighting by now. It\u2019s urban legend.\u2019</p><p>No one spoke for what seemed like a long time. Finally Esther said, \u2018It has been over a year. You\u2019d think that he\u2019d eventually...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Abe was his best friend,\u2019 Leah said. \u2018You know how tight they were.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know, but still. He has to get back to it sometime.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Says who?\u2019</p><p>\u2018What she means,\u2019 Maggie said, \u2018is that it was his life, back then. And now he\u2019s here, managing the shop. It\u2019s like everything just stopped.\u2019</p> <p>Another silence. Leah said, \u2018Well, for him it probably did. You know?\u2019</p><p>There was a tap on the door behind me, making me jump: at some point, Esther had slipped away from them and come back with the cash from the register. \u2018We\u2019re about out of here,\u2019 she said as she came in. I moved aside, like I did every night, as she ducked under the desk to the safe. \u2018You almost done?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah,\u2019 I said. She swung the door shut, pulling out the safe key. \u2018I\u2019ll, um, be out in a sec.\u2019</p><p>\u2018All right.\u2019</p><p>When she left, I turned back to my calculator, starting to add again. Halfway down the row of numbers, though, I stopped and sat as still as I could, listening hard to see if the conversation would double back to where it had been before. When it didn\u2019t, I bent back over my numbers, punching them in slowly this time, one by one by one, so as not to make the same mistake again.</p><p>By midnight, I\u2019d already walked the boardwalk and driven a full loop of Colby proper, and still had a few hours before I even wanted to think about going home. Clearly, I needed coffee. So I headed to the Gas/Gro.</p><p>I had just parked and was digging in my ashtray for change when I heard an engine zooming up behind me. When I looked up, a beat-up green truck was pulling in a few spaces down. Even before I saw the bikes piled in the back I recognized the short, stocky guy behind the wheel, and Adam, Maggie\u2019s friend, beside him. They cut the engine and hopped out, going inside. After a moment, I followed them.</p><p>The Gas/Gro was small but clean, with neat aisles and not too bright lighting. I went straight to the full-strength GroRoast, as was my habit, pulling out the biggest cup and filling it up. Adam and his friend were at the other end of the store, by the coolers, where they grabbed drinks before proceeding to the candy aisle.</p><p>\u2018Goobers,\u2019 Adam was saying as I added a bit of cream to my cup. \u2018Twizzlers. And... let me see. Maybe Junior Mints?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You know,\u2019 his friend said, \u2018you don\u2019t have to name each item out loud.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s my process, okay? I make better decisions when I vocalize as I do it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, it\u2019s annoying. At least do it quietly.\u2019</p><p>I put a lid on my cup, making sure it was secure, then started for the register, where a heavyset woman was buying some lottery tickets. A moment later, they stepped up behind me. I could see them in the mirrored reflection of the cigarette ad over our heads.</p><p>\u2018One fourteen,\u2019 the clerk said, ringing me up.</p><p>I slid my exact change over, then reached for my cup. As I turned, Adam said, \u2018Hey, I thought you looked familiar! You, um... work at Clementine\u2019s, right?\u2019</p><p>I knew that um. It was obvious my one night of bad judgment had branded me as The Girl Who Hooked up with Jake, although Adam was nice enough to not say this, at least to my face. \u2018Yeah,\u2019 I said. \u2018I do.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Adam,\u2019 he said, pointing to himself. \u2018And this is Wallace.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Auden,\u2019 I told him.</p><p>\u2018Look at that,\u2019 Adam said, nudging him. \u2018She bought a single cup of coffee. Such restraint!\u2019</p><p>\u2018No kidding,\u2019 Wallace said as they dumped their collective items onto the counter. \u2018Who can come to the Gas/Gro and only buy one thing?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well,\u2019 Adam said as the clerk began ringing things up, \u2018she\u2019s not from here.\u2019</p><p>\u2018This is true.\u2019 Wallace glanced at me. \u2018No offense, of course. It\u2019s just that we\u2019re \u2013\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Store-goers,\u2019 I finished for him, without even thinking. He looked surprised, then exchanged a smile with Adam. \u2018Exactly.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019ll be fifteen eighty-five,\u2019 the clerk said, and as they dug in their pockets, pulling out crumpled bills, I took the opportunity to slip out, back to my car. A moment later, they emerged, each carrying a bag, and climbed into the truck. I watched them back out, their lights moving across me as they pulled away.</p><p>I sat there and drank my coffee for a little while, considering my options. There was always the all-night diner. Or another loop around Colby. I glanced at my watch: only 12:15. So many hours to fill, and so little to do it with. Maybe it was for this reason that I found myself pulling out, turning in the direction they\u2019d gone. Not looking for Bigfoot, necessarily. Just something.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t hard to find the jump park. All you had to do was follow the bikes.</p><p>They were everywhere. Crowding the narrow sidewalks, on racks on the backs of cars, or sticking up from rails on the roof. I stuck close to an old Volkswagen van with a bright orange one hanging off it, following as it turned into a big lot two or three streets away from the beach. As I parked, I could see some bleachers bordered by two huge lights, which were shining down on a row of jumps, ramps made out of logs, and sand. Every once in a while, you\u2019d see someone on a bike rise up above the sight line, suspended in midair for just a moment before disappearing again.</p><p>There was also an oval track made up of various types of berms, which some people were circling, and down from that, two large, curved ramps facing each other. I sat in my car for a moment, watching someone in a black helmet ride down one side, then up the other, back and forth, mesmerized, as if someone were swinging a watch on a chain before my eyes. Then someone slammed the door on the Volkswagen, jerking me back to attention.</p><p>I was not sure what I was doing there. It wasn\u2019t like it was exactly my scene or crowd. The bleachers were filled with girls who were probably busy comparing lip glosses and mooning over the guys as they rode below them. Further proof: as I looked closer, I spotted Maggie sitting a few rows up, in pink, naturally. I hadn\u2019t looked closely enough to see if Jake was one of the guys currently moving through the jumps, but then again, I probably didn\u2019t need to.</p><p>I sat back, picking up my cup of coffee and taking a sip. Cars were still pulling in and parking, and occasionally people would pass by my car, their voices rising overhead. Each time, I felt more self-conscious, reaching for my keys to crank the engine and get out of there. But then they\u2019d move on, and I\u2019d let my hand drop. After all, it wasn\u2019t like I had anything better to do. And at least this way I wasn\u2019t wasting gas.</p> <p>\u2018Yo!\u2019 I heard someone yell suddenly from somewhere to my right. \u2018Pretty girl!</p><p>Where\u2019s the party at?\u2019</p><p>I recognized Jake\u2019s voice instantly. Sure enough, when I turned, I spotted him one row over and two down, leaning against a silver sedan. He had on jeans and a red long-sleeved shirt, the tails of which were flapping in the breeze as he took a sip of something in the blue plastic cup in his hand. It took me a minute before I realized he hadn\u2019t even been speaking to me but to a tall blonde who was walking a few rows down, her hands stuffed in the pockets of her jacket. She glanced up at him, smiling shyly, and kept walking. A moment later, he was catching up with her just a couple of cars in front of me.</p><p>Crap, I thought, watching as he flashed her that wide smile. Leaving right then would have attracted way too much attention, but it wasn\u2019t like I wanted to sit and watch my biggest mistake in recent memory play out before me either. I considered my options a moment, then carefully opened my door, sliding my feet onto the gravel. I eased it shut, ducking down as I rounded the car beside me, then put another, and yet another between us.</p><p>Due to my zigzag escape, I ended up in an area off to the left of the jump park, where there were only a couple of bike racks and a few straggly trees. It was just out of the reach of the bright lights by the bleachers, so I could see everything without being spotted. In other words, perfect.</p><p>I leaned against a bike rack as I watched people move through the line of jumps. At first glance, each rider looked the same, but with further study I realized everyone was going at different speeds on their approach, and some stayed closer to the ground, cautious, while others rose up high, then higher still on the next. Occasionally there\u2019d be a smatter of applause or some hooting from the bleachers, but otherwise it was strangely quiet, just the sound of tires on gravel, broken up by moments of silence as they went airborne.</p> <p>After a while, I spotted Adam and Wallace, sitting on their bikes, helmets off, where people were lining up for the jumps. Wallace was eating Pringles, while Adam was looking up at the bleachers, gesturing for someone there to come join them. Following his gaze, I found Maggie again, still alone, still staring down at the ramps. You can keep looking, I wanted to tell her, but most likely, he\u2019s under those bleachers, not in front of them. Stupid girl.</p><p>Just as I thought this, she stood suddenly, like she\u2019d heard me. I watched as she reached up, pulling her dark curls back at the base of her neck, then twisted an elastic around them. She reached into the bag beside her and pulled out a helmet, grabbing it by the strap and starting down the bleachers to the boys waiting below.</p><p>I had to admit I was surprised. What I saw next, though, left me stunned: when she got to Adam, he hopped off his bike, offering it to her, and she climbed on, pulling the helmet over her head. He said something to her, and she nodded, then pushed back slowly, flexing her fingers over the ends of the handlebars. When she was about twenty feet back, she rose up on the pedals for a moment, squaring her shoulders, and started toward the jumps.</p><p>She hit the first one at moderate speed, kicking up a bit of dust, gaining even more momentum as she approached, then cleared the next. By the third, she was rising up really high, shoulders hunched, the bike seeming to float beneath her. Even from my limited experience, I could tell she was good: she hit the jumps squarely, and her landings were smooth, not clumsy like some of the other riders I\u2019d seen. It seemed to take her no time or effort at all to do the entire set of them, and then she was circling back to where the boys were waiting. Wallace offered her a Pringle, and she took it, flipping up the visor of her helmet to pop it in her mouth.</p><p>I was so busy watching this that at first, I didn\u2019t see the figure that had appeared off to my right, so it took a second to realize it was Eli. His hair was loose over his shoulders, and he had on jeans and a green long-sleeved T-shirt. Unfortunately, by the time I processed all this, I\u2019d been staring at him long enough for him to notice. He turned and looked right at me, and I nodded at him in reply, in what I hoped seemed like a casual way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He nodded back, sliding his hands in his pockets, and I thought of what Esther, Leah, and Maggie had been talking about earlier that day, how he did or didn\u2019t ride anymore, and the reasons, or person, behind that choice. Not that it was any of my business. I was leaving anyway.</p><p>I started toward my car, which meant I had to walk right by him. As I got closer, he glanced up at me again. \u2018Already leaving,\u2019 he said in that flat voice I recognized. \u2018Not exciting enough for you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 I said. \u2018Just... I have somewhere I have to be.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Busy times,\u2019 he said.</p> <p>\u2018That\u2019s right.\u2019</p><p>I didn\u2019t pretend to know Eli at all, but even so, I\u2019d noticed that his manner was slightly hard to read. It was something in the way he talked that made it difficult to tell whether he was kidding or serious or what. This bothered me. Or intrigued me. Or both.</p><p>\u2018So,\u2019 I said after a moment, figuring I had nothing to lose in asking, \u2018do you jump?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nope,\u2019 he replied. \u2018You?\u2019</p><p>I almost laughed, then thought of Maggie and realized this maybe was not a joke. \u2018No,\u2019 I said. \u2018I don\u2019t even... I mean, I haven\u2019t ridden a bike in ages.\u2019</p> <p>He considered this, then looked back at the jumps. \u2018Really.\u2019</p><p>This too was said flatly, no intonation, so I had nothing to go on. Still, I felt defensive as I said, \u2018I just... I wasn\u2019t much for outdoor stuff as a kid.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Outdoor stuff,\u2019 he repeated.</p><p>\u2018I mean, I went outside,\u2019 I added. \u2018I wasn\u2019t a recluse or anything. I just didn\u2019t ride bikes very much. And haven\u2019t recently.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Right.\u2019</p><p>Again, it wasn\u2019t like this was critical, necessarily. But something about it still bugged me. \u2018What,\u2019 I said, \u2018is that a crime here or something? Like only buying one thing at the Gas/Gro?\u2019</p> <p>I meant to say this in a kidding sort of way, but I sounded shrill even to my own ears, hearing it. Or maybe just crazy. Eli said, \u2018What?\u2019</p><p>I felt my face flush. \u2018Nothing. Forget it.\u2019</p><p>I turned to go, pulling my keys out of my pocket. I\u2019d only taken two steps, though, when he said, \u2018You know, if you don\u2019t know how to ride a bike, that\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I can ride a bike,\u2019 I said. And this was true. I\u2019d learned over Christmas when I was seven, in our driveway, on Hollis\u2019s old Schwinn, with training wheels. From what I remembered, I\u2019d liked it, or at least not hated it. Which did not explain why I couldn\u2019t actually recall doing it very much since then. Or, at all. \u2018I just... I haven\u2019t had the opportunity in a while.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Huh,\u2019 he said.</p><p>That was just it. Just Huh. Jesus. \u2018What?\u2019</p><p>He raised his eyebrows. Probably because again, my voice sounded high, slightly unbalanced. It was so weird, because usually I was totally nervous talking to guys. But Eli was different. He made me want to say more, not less. Which was maybe not such a good thing.</p><p>\u2018All I\u2019m saying,\u2019 he said after a moment, \u2018is that we are at a jump park.\u2019</p> <p>I just looked at him. \u2018I\u2019m not going to ride a bike just to prove to you that I can.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not asking you to,\u2019 he replied. \u2018However, if you\u2019re looking for an opportunity... here\u2019s your chance. That\u2019s all.\u2019</p><p>Which, of course, made perfect sense. I\u2019d said I hadn\u2019t had the opportunity: he was pointing out that now I did. So why did I feel so unnerved?</p><p>I took a breath, then another, so my voice was calm, level as I said, \u2018I think I\u2019ll pass, actually.\u2019</p><p>\u2018All righty,\u2019 he said, hardly bothered.</p><p>And then I was walking back to my car. End of subject and conversation. But \u2018all righty\u2019? What was that?</p><p>Once behind the wheel, the door shut behind me, I looked back at him, already thinking of a dozen other, better ways I could have handled this conversation. I cranked my engine, then backed out of my space. The last thing I saw before turning around was Eli right where I\u2019d left him, still looking up at the jumps. His head was cocked slightly to the side, as if he was thinking hard, the jumpers rising up in front of him. From this distance, you couldn\u2019t tell them apart, distinguish their various styles or approaches. They were all the same, moving in a steady line, up, down, in view for only a moment, then gone again.</p><p>Chapter SEVEN</p><p>When it came to Thisbe, Heidi worried about everything. How much she slept. Whether she ate enough. Whether she ate too much. What that red spot on her leg was. (Ring-worm? Eczema? The mark of the devil?) If it hurt her to cry so much/her hair was going to fall out/her poops were the right color. And now, she was going to give the kid an identity crisis.</p><p>\u2018My goodness!\u2019 I heard her saying one day when I came down for my coffee around four P.M. She and Thisbe were in the living room, having \u2018tummy time\u2019 \u2013 which she did religiously, as it was supposed to keep the baby from having a flat head \u2013 on the floor. \u2018Look at how strong you are!\u2019</p><p>Initially, I was too focused on getting my caffeine levels up to pay attention to them. Also, I\u2019d kind of mastered tuning Heidi out, if only out of necessity. But after I\u2019d had a half a cup I began to notice something was amiss.</p><p>\u2018Caroline,\u2019 she was saying in a singsong voice, drawing out each syllable. \u2018Who\u2019s my pretty Caroline girl?\u2019</p><p>I filled my cup up again, then walked into the living room. She was leaning over the baby, who was on her stomach, struggling to hold up that big, possibly flat head. \u2018Caroline,\u2019 she said, tickling the baby\u2019s back. \u2018Miss Pretty Caroline West.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I thought her name was Thisbe,\u2019 I said.</p><p>Heidi jumped, startled, then looked up at me. \u2018Auden,\u2019 she stammered. \u2018I... I didn\u2019t hear you come in.\u2019</p><p>I looked at her, then at the baby, then back at her again. \u2018I was actually just passing through,\u2019 I told her, and turned to go. I thought I was safe, but then, just as I reached the stairs, she spoke.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t like the name!\u2019 When I turned back, she looked up at the ceiling, her face flushed, like someone else had said this. Then she sighed, sitting back on her heels. \u2018I don\u2019t,\u2019 she said slowly, more quietly. \u2018I wanted to name her Isabel. It\u2019s the name of one of my best friends here in Colby, and I\u2019d always loved it.\u2019</p><p>Hearing this, I looked longingly up the stairs in the direction of my dad\u2019s office, wishing, as I always did, that he was here to deal with this instead of me. But lately he\u2019d been even more immersed in his book, the apples piling up uneaten. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018So,\u2019 I said to Heidi, walking back over to her, \u2018why didn\u2019t you?\u2019</p><p>She bit her lip, smoothing her hand over the baby\u2019s back. \u2018Your father wanted her to have a literary name,\u2019 she said. \u2018He said Isabel was too pedestrian, common, that with it, she\u2019d never have a chance at greatness. But I worry Thisbe is just too unusual, too exotic. It\u2019s got to be hard to have a name hardly anyone\u2019s ever heard of, don\u2019t you think?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well,\u2019 I said, \u2018not necessarily.\u2019</p><p>Her mouth dropped open. \u2018Oh!</p> <p>Auden! I wasn\u2019t saying that yours \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know, I know,\u2019 I said, holding up my hand to fend off this apology, which would likely have gone on for ages. \u2018I\u2019m just saying, from experience, it hasn\u2019t really been a hindrance. That\u2019s all.\u2019</p><p>She nodded, then looked back down at Thisbe. \u2018Well,\u2019 she said. \u2018I guess that is good to know.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But if you don\u2019t like it,\u2019 I told her, \u2018just call her Caroline. I mean \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Who\u2019s being called Caroline?\u2019</p> <p>I jumped, turning to see my dad, standing at the bottom of the stairs. Clearly, I was not the only one creeping around. \u2018Oh,\u2019 I said. \u2018I was just saying it\u2019s the baby\u2019s middle name \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Middle name,\u2019 he repeated. \u2018And only because her mother insisted. I wanted to name her Thisbe Andromeda.\u2019</p><p>Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Heidi wince. \u2018Really?\u2019 I said.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s powerful!\u2019 he replied, pounding his chest for emphasis. \u2018Memorable. And it can\u2019t be shortened or cutified, which is how a name should be. If you were an Ashley or a Lisa, and not an Auden, do you think you\u2019d be so special?\u2019</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure how I was supposed to answer this. Did he actually expect me to agree that it was his choice of name, and not all my hard work, that had gotten me where I was?</p><p>Luckily, it seemed to be a rhetorical question, as he was already en route to the fridge, where he pulled out a beer. \u2018I think,\u2019 Heidi said, glancing at me, \u2018that while names are important, it\u2019s the person who really defines themselves. So if Thisbe is a Thisbe, that\u2019s great. But if she wants to be a Caroline, then she has that option.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018She is not,\u2019 my dad said, popping his beer, \u2018going to be a Caroline.\u2019</p><p>I just looked at him, trying to figure out when, exactly, he\u2019d gotten so pompous and impossible. He couldn\u2019t have been like this my entire life. I would have remembered it. Wouldn\u2019t I?</p><p>\u2018You know,\u2019 Heidi said quickly, scooping the baby up and coming into the kitchen, \u2018I don\u2019t even know your middle name, Auden. What is it?\u2019</p><p>I kept my eyes on my dad, steadily, as I said, \u2018Penelope.\u2019</p><p>\u2018See?\u2019 said my dad to her, as if this proved something. \u2018Strong. Literary. Unique.\u2019</p><p>Embarrassing, I thought. Too long. Pretentious. \u2018That\u2019s lovely!\u2019 Heidi said too enthusiastically. \u2018I had no idea.\u2019</p><p>I didn\u2019t say anything, instead just downed the rest of my coffee and put the cup in the sink. I could feel Heidi watching me, though, even as my dad headed out onto the front deck with his beer. I heard her take in a breath, about to say something, but luckily, then my dad was calling her, asking what she wanted to do for dinner.</p><p>\u2018Oh, I don\u2019t know,\u2019 she said, glancing at me as she put Thisbe in her bouncy seat, which was on the kitchen table. She fastened her in, then shot me an apologetic look as she stepped outside to join him. \u2018What are you in the mood for?\u2019</p> <p>I stood there for a moment, watching them stand together, looking out at the water. My dad was drinking his beer, and as Heidi talked he looped his arm around her waist, pulling her closer to him, and she rested her head on his shoulder. You just couldn\u2019t even begin to understand how some things worked, or so I was learning.</p><p>On the counter, the baby made a gurgling noise, waving her arms around, and I walked over, looking down at her. She couldn\u2019t look you in the eye yet: instead, her gaze always found the center of your forehead.</p><p>Maybe she would be a Thisbe, after all, and never even consider Caroline. But it was the thought of my dad\u2019s face, so sure, as he stated otherwise that made me lean in close to her ear and christen her anew. Part her given name, part the one Heidi had wanted, but all mine.</p><p>\u2018Hey, Isby,\u2019 I whispered. \u2018Aren\u2019t you a pretty Isby girl.\u2019</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>There\u2019s something about living at the beach in the summer. You get so used to the sun and sand that it gets hard to remember what the rest of the world, and the year, is like. When I opened the front door to an outright downpour a couple of days later, I just stood there for a moment, realizing that I\u2019d forgotten all about rainy days.</p><p>Since I had no rain jacket, I had to borrow one from Heidi, who offered me three colors: bright pink, light pink, and, in her words, \u2018dusky pink\u2019, whatever that meant. I picked the light one, yet still felt positively radioactive as I walked down the gray, wet sidewalk, boldly contrasting with everything around me.</p><p>At Clementine\u2019s, Maggie was behind the counter, in a miniskirt, flip-flops, and a worn T-shirt that said CLYDE\u2019S RIDES on it, bicycle wheels in both the Ds. She was bent over a magazine, most likely her beloved Hollyworld, and gave me a sleepy wave as I approached.</p><p>\u2018Still coming down out there, huh?\u2019 she said, reaching into the register to hand me the day\u2019s receipts.</p><p>\u2018Yup,\u2019 I replied. \u2018Any shipments?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Not yet.\u2019</p><p>I nodded, and then she went back to her reading, turning a page. While Esther and Leah sometimes attempted more conversation with me, Maggie always kept it to a minimum, which I actually appreciated. It wasn\u2019t like we needed to pretend we were friends, or had anything in common other than our employer. And while I had to admit to still being somewhat surprised by what I\u2019d seen her do at the jump park, otherwise I figured I pretty much had her pegged, and knew she probably felt that exact same way about me.</p><p>I went to the office, which for some reason was freezing, so I kept Heidi\u2019s jacket on as I got settled, pulling out the checkbook and finding my calculator. For the next hour or so, the store was pretty dead, aside from a couple of groups of girls coming in to pick through the clearance rack and moon over the shoes. Occasionally I\u2019d hear Maggie\u2019s phone beep as a text message came in, but otherwise it was pretty quiet. Then, at around six, the door chimed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Hi there,\u2019 I heard Maggie say. \u2018Can I help you find anything?\u2019</p><p>There was a pause, and I wondered if the person had heard her. Then, though, came the voice I knew better than just about any other. \u2018Oh, dear God no,\u2019 my mother said, and I could hear the shudder in her tone. \u2018I\u2019m just looking for my daughter.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re Auden\u2019s mom?\u2019 Maggie said. \u2018That\u2019s great! She\u2019s in back. I\u2019m sure she \u2013\u2019</p><p>I sat bolt upright, then pushed my chair back and scrambled to the door. Even though I got out to the floor as fast as I could, it wasn\u2019t quick enough. I found my mother, dressed in her customary all-black \u2013 dress, sweater over it, hair piled on her head \u2013 by the makeup display. She was holding a glass bottle at arm\u2019s length, her eyes narrowed as she examined the printed label.</p> <p>\u2018Booty Berry,\u2019 she read slowly, enunciating each word. Then she looked over her glasses at Maggie. \u2018And this is?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Perfume,\u2019 Maggie told her. Then she smiled at me. \u2018Or, actually, body spritzette. It\u2019s like perfume, but lighter and longer lasting, for everyday use.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Of course,\u2019 my mother said, her voice flat. She replaced the bottle, then took a long look around the store, her displeasure more than evident. When she finally got to me, she didn\u2019t look any happier. \u2018Well. There you are.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hi,\u2019 I said. She was studying me with such seriousness that I was instantly nervous, then even more so when I remembered the pink jacket I had on. \u2018I, um... when did you decide to come down?\u2019</p><p>My mother sighed, turning past Maggie \u2013 who was now smiling at her, for some reason \u2013 to the bathing suits, which she surveyed with an expression one might reserve for observing some sort of tragedy. \u2018This morning,\u2019 she said, shaking her head as she reached out to touch an orange bottom, trimmed with ruffles. \u2018I was desperate for an escape, but I seem to have brought foul mood and weather with me.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Oh, don\u2019t worry about that,\u2019 Maggie said. \u2018The rain\u2019s supposed to taper off tonight. Tomorrow will be gorgeous! Perfect beach weather. You\u2019ll get that suntan yet.\u2019</p><p>My mom turned back to look at her as if she were speaking in tongues. \u2018Well,\u2019 she said, in such a way I knew she was holding back everything she was actually thinking, \u2018won\u2019t that be nice.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Have you eaten?\u2019 I asked her, too eagerly. I took a breath, then said more calmly, \u2018There\u2019s a really good place just a bit down the boardwalk. I can probably take off for an hour or so.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Of course you can!\u2019 Maggie said. \u2018You should totally hang out with your mom. The books can wait.\u2019</p><p>My mom eyed Maggie again, as if doubting she could recognize a book, much less read one. \u2018I could use a drink, at any rate,\u2019 she said, taking another look around the store before starting for the door. Even her stride was disapproving. \u2018Lead the way.\u2019</p><p>I glanced at Maggie, who was watching her, fascinated. \u2018I\u2019ll be back in a little bit, okay?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Take your time!\u2019 she said. \u2018Really. I\u2019m fine here alone.\u2019</p><p>My mother snorted softly, hearing this, and then, thankfully, we were out the door, back into the rain. As soon as it swung shut behind us she said, \u2018Oh, Auden. It\u2019s even worse than I expected.\u2019</p><p>I felt my face flush, although I wasn\u2019t surprised she was so up front. \u2018I needed a rain jacket,\u2019 I said. \u2018I wouldn\u2019t normally \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018I mean,\u2019 she continued, \u2018I knew any business Heidi owned would probably not be to my sensibilities. But Booty Berry? And what about those Lolita-esque swimming bottoms? Are we packaging women to look like little girls now? Or little girls to look even more so, in order to exploit their innocence? How can she be a woman, not to mention a mother, and condone this sort of thing?\u2019</p><p>Hearing this, I relaxed, as my mother\u2019s rants were as familiar to me as nursery rhymes. \u2018Well,\u2019 I said, \u2018the fact is, she knows her market. That stuff really sells.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Of course it does! But that doesn\u2019t make it right.\u2019 My mother sighed, opening her umbrella and raising it over her head, then offering me her arm, which I took, stepping beneath it with her. \u2018And all that pink. It\u2019s like a giant vagina in there.\u2019</p><p>I stifled a laugh, covering my mouth with my hand.</p><p>\u2018But I guess that\u2019s the point,\u2019 she said, sighing. \u2018It\u2019s just so bothersome because it\u2019s the most shallow, base depiction of the female experience. Sugar and spice and everything nice, peddling packaging, not substance.\u2019</p> <p>We were at the Last Chance now, where for once there was no line. \u2018This is the place,\u2019 I said, nodding at it. \u2018The onion rings are to die for.\u2019</p><p>My mother peered in the door. \u2018Oh, no, no. I\u2019ll require at least tablecloths and a wine list. Let\u2019s keep looking.\u2019</p><p>We ended up back at the hotel where she was staying, a small boutique place called the Condor just off the boardwalk. Its restaurant was tiny, crowded with only a few tables, and dim, heavy red curtains hanging from the windows, the carpet a matching shade. My mother settled into a booth, nodded her approval at the flickering candle on the table, and ordered a glass of cabernet from the hostess as she shed her sweater. After a pointed look, I took off Heidi\u2019s jacket, stuffing it under my bag, out of sight.</p><p>\u2018So,\u2019 she said, once her wine had arrived and she\u2019d taken a big gulp. \u2018Tell me about your father\u2019s book. He must be done by now, ready to send it off to his agent. Has he let you read it?\u2019</p><p>I looked down at my water glass, moving it in a circle on the table. \u2018Not yet,\u2019 I said carefully, as I knew she was looking for more than just the answer to this question. \u2018He\u2019s working day and night, though.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sounds more like writing than revising,\u2019 she observed, picking up the menu and scanning it before setting it aside. I didn\u2019t say anything. \u2018But then, your father did always have odd work habits. Writing never came easily for him, as it does for some others.\u2019</p><p>Right, I thought. Time for a subject change. \u2018The baby\u2019s pretty cute,\u2019 I said. \u2018She still cries a lot, though. Heidi thinks she has colic.\u2019</p><p>\u2018If you think a baby has colic, it probably doesn\u2019t,\u2019 my mother said, taking another sip of her wine. \u2018You know. With Hollis, there was no question. From the first night home, he screamed his lungs out. It lasted for three months.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I nodded. \u2018Well, Thisbe\u2019s pretty fussy...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Thisbe.\u2019 My mother shook her head. \u2018I still cannot believe that name. Your father and his delusions of grandeur. What\u2019s the middle name? Persephone? Beatrice?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Caroline.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Really?\u2019 I nodded. \u2018How quaint. And unlike him.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Heidi fought for it, apparently.\u2019</p><p>\u2018She should have fought harder,\u2019 my mom said. \u2018It\u2019s only a middle name, after all.\u2019</p><p>The waiter came by then, asking if we wanted appetizers. As my mother picked up the menu again, ordering us some scallop ceviche and a cheese plate, I looked down at Heidi\u2019s jacket, the pink now barely visible against the dark red of the booth all around it. I had a flash of her face the day we\u2019d been discussing names, how she\u2019d rushed to compliment my own cumbersome middle name, just because she assumed it would make me feel better.</p><p>\u2018Then again,\u2019 my mom said as the waiter left, \u2018I doubt your father picked Heidi for her fortitude. Quite the opposite, in fact. I think all he really wanted was someone fluffy and insubstantial, so that he could be absolutely sure she\u2019d always follow his lead.\u2019</p><p>I knew that she was probably right. After all, it wasn\u2019t like Heidi had showed any great backbone in the last few weeks. And yet, somehow, I heard myself say, \u2018Heidi\u2019s not completely ditzy, though.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018No?\u2019</p><p>I shook my head. \u2018She\u2019s actually a pretty sharp business-woman.\u2019</p><p>She turned to face me, her dark eyes meeting mine. \u2018Really.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah. I mean, I know because I\u2019m doing her books.\u2019 I\u2019d forgotten how penetrating my mother\u2019s looks could be, and I broke quickly, turning my attention back to my water glass. \u2018Clementine\u2019s could be just a seasonal business, but somehow she\u2019s managing to turn a monthly profit all year long. And she\u2019s really savvy when it comes to catching trends. A lot of the stuff she ordered last year at this time went on to be huge.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I see,\u2019 she said slowly. \u2018Like, Booty Berry, for instance?\u2019</p><p>I flushed. Why was I even defending Heidi, anyway? \u2018I\u2019m just saying,\u2019 I said. \u2018She\u2019s not just what she appears.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018No one is,\u2019 she said, once again managing to both have the last word and make it seem like she\u2019d been right all along. How she always did that, I had no idea. \u2018But enough about Heidi. Let\u2019s talk about you. How\u2019s the reading going for next year? You must be getting a lot done.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I am,\u2019 I said. \u2018It\u2019s slow going, though. The textbooks are pretty dry, especially the econ stuff. But I think \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Auden, you can\u2019t expect any subject to simplify itself for you,\u2019 she said. \u2018Nor should you want it to. A challenge only means you\u2019ll retain the information that much better.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know,\u2019 I replied. \u2018It\u2019s just kind of hard, doing the reading without any direction from a professor. I think once I\u2019m in the class, it\u2019ll be easier to know what\u2019s important.\u2019</p><p>She shook her head. \u2018But you shouldn\u2019t need that. Too often I have students who are happy to just wait for me to explain to them what a line of dialogue or stage direction means within the context of the play. They don\u2019t even think to try to figure it out themselves. But in Shakespeare\u2019s time, you had only the text. It\u2019s up to you to decipher the meaning. It\u2019s the only pure way to learn.\u2019</p><p>She was getting fired up, clearly. Which was probably why it was a mistake to say, \u2018But this is economics, not literature. It\u2019s different.\u2019</p><p>Now she really zeroed in on me, narrowing her gaze. \u2018No, Auden, it\u2019s not. That\u2019s exactly my point. When have I ever taught you to take another person\u2019s view on anything?\u2019</p><p>I just sat there, this time knowing better than to answer. Thankfully, then our food arrived, and she got this last word, as well.</p> <p>Things did not really improve from there. She gave up on me as a source of conversation, instead ordering another glass of wine before launching into a long, protracted story about some curriculum dispute that was apparently draining all her time and energy. I half listened, making affirming noises when necessary, and picked at my salad and pasta. By the time we were done, it was past eight, and when we stepped back outside, the rain had stopped, and the sky was now streaked with pink.</p><p>\u2018Well, look at that,\u2019 my mother said, taking it in. \u2018It\u2019s your favorite color.\u2019</p><p>I felt this like a sudden slap, which was exactly how it was intended. \u2018I don\u2019t like pink,\u2019 I said, my voice as stiff as I felt.</p><p>She smiled at me, then reached over, ruffling my hair. \u2018Methinks you doth protest too much,\u2019 she said. \u2018And your choice of outerwear says otherwise.\u2019</p><p>I looked down at Heidi\u2019s jacket. \u2018This isn\u2019t mine. I told you that.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, Auden, relax. I\u2019m just kidding.\u2019 She took a deep breath, then let it out, closing her eyes. \u2018And besides, maybe it\u2019s to be expected that you\u2019d change a bit, down here with Heidi and these people. I suppose I couldn\u2019t expect to keep you as my very own doppelg\u00e4nger forever. Eventually, you\u2019d want to try the Booty Berry, so to speak.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t,\u2019 I said, and now I could hear the edge in my voice. She did, too, her eyes widening, but just slightly. \u2018I mean, I\u2019m not. I just work there. That\u2019s all.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Honey, it\u2019s fine,\u2019 she said, ruffling my hair again, but this time I stepped out of her reach, hating her condescension, the way she smiled, shrugging. \u2018We all have our dirty little secrets, don\u2019t we?\u2019</p><p>It was only pure chance, and nothing else, that led me at this exact moment to look over the fence behind us to the hotel pool, which was deserted, save for one person. One person in black, square-framed glasses, his skin pale enough to be translucent, wearing red trunks and reading a small, hardback book that you knew at one glance was Literature. I glanced at my mother, catching her eye, then turned back to him, making sure her gaze followed mine. When it did, I said, \u2018I guess we do.\u2019</p><p>She tried to keep her face relaxed, but there was one, quick twitch as this remark hit home. But I didn\u2019t feel good about it. I didn\u2019t feel anything.</p><p>\u2018Well,\u2019 she said after a moment. \u2018I\u2019m sure you need to get back to your job.\u2019 She said these last two words the same way she referred to my dad\u2019s book, making it clear that she doubted it mattered or even existed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She leaned closer, offering me her cheek to kiss, but I stayed where I was. She smiled at me again, then said, \u2018Oh, darling, don\u2019t be bitter. It\u2019s the first instinct of the weak.\u2019</p><p>I bit my lip, turning away from her, and didn\u2019t respond to this. Instead, I dug my hands deep into Heidi\u2019s jacket, as if to tear the pink right off it, as I walked away. Someone else might have called after me, but I knew my mother wouldn\u2019t. She\u2019d gotten her last word, and it was a good one, and to her, that was all that mattered.</p><p>On the way back to Clementine\u2019s, I kept my head down, trying to swallow over the thick lump that had appeared in my throat. Clearly, it was my defending Heidi that had set her off, even though I\u2019d only said that she wasn\u2019t \u2018that much of a ditz\u2019, and then paid her two small compliments. But that was enough, in my mother\u2019s eyes, to put me squarely in the big pink camp. If I wasn\u2019t in total agreement with her, I might as well have been Heidi. There was no middle ground.</p><p>Thinking this, I felt tears fill my eyes, just as I pulled open the door to Clementine\u2019s. Luckily, Esther and Leah were clustered at the counter with Maggie, all of them discussing their evening plans, as always. They barely paid me any attention as I walked past to the office, where I sat down at the desk, fully intending to get back to work. But after about twenty minutes of my numbers blurring as I wiped my eyes with the back of my hands, I decided to call it a night.</p> <p>Before I left the office, I pulled my hair back in a rubber band, then arranged my face to as stoic and unbothered an expression as I could manage. Two deep breaths, and then I was walking to the door.</p><p>\u2018The thing is,\u2019 Leah was saying as I came onto the floor, \u2018I\u2019m never going to meet a hot guy at a coffee shop.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Says who?\u2019 Esther asked.</p><p>\u2018General logic. They just don\u2019t hang out there.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What about the hot, sensitive, artistic type? They live at coffee shops.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018See, but,\u2019 Leah said, \u2018artistic isn\u2019t hot to me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, right. You only like greased-up frat boys,\u2019 Esther replied.</p><p>\u2018Grease is your specialty, actually. It\u2019s the artistic types who don\u2019t bathe.\u2019</p><p>I was hoping that this conversation was engrossing enough that they\u2019d hardly notice me. But no luck. When they saw me coming, I had their full attention.</p><p>\u2018So, I\u2019ve got to go,\u2019 I said, keeping my voice casual. \u2018The receipts are done, and I\u2019ll come in early to finish payroll tomorrow.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Okay,\u2019 Maggie said. \u2018Hey, did you have fun with your \u2013\u2019</p> <p>\u2018You know,\u2019 Esther said suddenly to Leah, \u2018I kind of resent that remark. I have never dated anyone as greasy as that air force guy you met last summer.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That wasn\u2019t grease,\u2019 Leah said, picking up her phone and scanning the screen. \u2018That was hair gel.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I think it counts.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It doesn\u2019t.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You sure about that? Because...\u2019</p><p>Thankfully, due to this, I was able to pretend I hadn\u2019t heard Maggie\u2019s half question, and slip out the door without further explanation. Not that she seemed to notice: when I glanced back, she was laughing at something Leah was saying, while Esther rolled her eyes, the three of them securely in their little pink world, as always.</p><p>I hit Beach Beans, which was a few stores down, for a large coffee, then found a place on the sand and drank it while the sun set. After downing the last drop, I pulled out my phone and hit number one on my speed dial.</p><p>\u2018Dr. Victoria West.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Hi, Mom. It\u2019s me.\u2019</p><p>There was a slight pause. Then, \u2018Auden. I thought I might hear from you.\u2019</p><p>Not a good start, but I pressed on anyway. \u2018I just,\u2019 I said, \u2018I wanted to see if you might want to have breakfast tomorrow morning.\u2019</p><p>She sighed. \u2018Oh, darling, I\u2019d love to, but I\u2019m heading back very early. I fear this trip was ill advised, to be honest. I forgot how much I dislike the beach. Everything is just so...\u2019</p><p>I waited for the adjective that would fill this gap, knowing it probably was meant to describe me, as well. But she let it trail off, sparing both the coast and myself.</p><p>\u2018Anyway,\u2019 she said after a moment of too-noticeable silence, \u2018it was lovely to see you. Do let me know how your summer progresses. I want to know everything.\u2019</p><p>It was not lost on me that this was exactly what she\u2019d said to me the day I left. Then, though, we\u2019d both known she meant the gory, mockable details of my dad and Heidi and their silly lives. The life that I, with one pink raincoat, was now living as well.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll do that,\u2019 I said. \u2018Have a safe drive back.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I will. Good-bye, sweetheart.\u2019</p><p>I shut my phone, then just sat there, feeling that lump rise in my throat again. I\u2019d always had to work so hard to keep my mother\u2019s interest, wresting it away from her work, her colleagues, her students, my brother. I\u2019d often wondered if it was ridiculous to feel this way. Clearly, though, my instincts had been right: her attention was not only hard to come by, but entirely too easy to lose.</p><p>I sat there for a long time, watching as people walked up and down the beach in front of me. There were families, kids running ahead and dodging the waves. Couples holding hands. Groups of girls, groups of guys, surfers dotting the distant breakers, even as darkness began to fall. Eventually, though, the sand grew empty, as lights came on in the houses behind me and on the pier in the distance. The night was only just starting, and there was still so long to go until morning. The very thought made me tired, so tired.</p><p>\u2018Auden?\u2019</p><p>I jumped, then turned my head to see Maggie standing beside me. Her hair was blowing in the breeze, her bag over her shoulder. Behind her, the boardwalk was a row of lights, one right after the other.</p><p>\u2018You okay?\u2019 she said. When I didn\u2019t respond, she added, \u2018You seemed kind of sad when you left.\u2019</p><p>I had a flash of my mother, the dismissive way she\u2019d looked at Maggie, the bikini bottoms, the Booty Berry, and then me, all of us grouped in the category of Not to Her Liking. But it was vast, that place I\u2019d struggled to avoid for so long, as wide and long as the beach where we were right then. And now that I finally found myself squarely in it, I realized I was kind of glad to have company.</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 I said to her. \u2018I don\u2019t think I am, actually.\u2019</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure what I expected her to do or say to this. It was all new to me, from that second on. But clearly, she\u2019d been there before. It was obvious in the easy way she shrugged off her bag, letting it fall with a thump onto the sand, before sitting down beside me. She didn\u2019t pull me close for a big bonding hug, or offer up some saccharine words of comfort, both of which would have sent me running for sure. Instead, she gave me nothing but her company, realizing even before I did that this, in fact, was just what I needed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter EIGHT</p><p>\u2018What I find,\u2019 Maggie said, \u2018is that when you get gum, you always need something else. Because gum isn\u2019t really a snack.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So true,\u2019 Esther agreed.</p><p>\u2018If I do get gum, I always grab some chips, or maybe a cookie two-pack, as well. That way you know you\u2019ve got your food and something refreshing for afterward.\u2019</p> <p>Leah shook her head. \u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 she said. \u2018What about Tic Tacs? They\u2019re like gum, but I\u2019ve been known to eat them for a meal before.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Tic Tacs you actually swallow, though,\u2019 Esther pointed out. \u2018You own a Tic Tac. Gum is just borrowed.\u2019</p><p>Maggie turned to her, smiling. \u2018Impressive.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Thank you,\u2019 Esther replied. \u2018I always feel inspired here at the Gas/Gro.\u2019</p><p>I, however, was not feeling inspired. Or impressed. If anything, I felt completely out of my element, a stranger in a strange world. One minute I was alone on the beach, and the next, I was here, a girl among girls, maybe even a store-goer.</p> <p>When Maggie had first sat down beside me, I\u2019d had no idea what to expect. I had friends from the various schools I\u2019d attended, but the one common denominator was that I\u2019d never really done the girly thing with any of them. Our interactions, instead, were mostly limited to academic discussions, our solid common ground. So all I had to go on were the snippets of chick flicks I\u2019d caught here and there on basic cable, where women only seemed to bond while drinking too much, playing disco music, dancing together, or all of the above. But since none of these things was going to happen on my watch, even in my depressed state, I had to wonder what, exactly would. When Maggie finally spoke, though, she managed to surprise me. Again.</p><p>\u2018So your mom\u2019s kind of a badass, huh.\u2019</p><p>I turned to look at her. She was staring out at the water, her hair blowing around her face, knees pulled to her chest. I said, \u2018That\u2019s one word for her.\u2019</p><p>She smiled, then reached over for her bag, plopping it between us and then reaching a hand in to dig around for something. After a moment, she pulled a magazine out, and I braced myself for some celebrity analogy, God help me. Instead, I was shocked to see it was a college catalog from the U as she pulled it into her lap, flipping through a few pages until she found one with the corner folded down. Then she handed it to me.</p><p>U ENGLISH AND YOU it said. The words were somewhat hard to read, as I had only the distant glow of the house behind us to go on. But the picture of my mom \u2013 sitting at the head of a seminar table, her glasses in one hand, clearly mid-lecture \u2013 I would have known in any light, any distance.</p><p>\u2018Where did you get this?\u2019 I asked her.</p> <p>\u2018It came with my application package. The English department was the main reason I applied there.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re going to the U?\u2019</p><p>She shook her head, and I felt bad for asking, as a rejection had to be a sore subject. \u2018I did tons of research, though. I knew your mom looked familiar in the store today. But I couldn\u2019t figure out why until I went home and found that.\u2019</p><p>I looked down at my mom\u2019s picture again, then slowly shut the catalog. \u2018She\u2019s... complex,\u2019 I said. \u2018It\u2019s not always easy being her daughter.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I think,\u2019 she said, \u2018sometimes it\u2019s hard no matter whose daughter you are.\u2019</p><p>I considered this as I handed the catalog back to her and she returned it to her bag. For a moment we just sat there, both of us quiet, looking at the water. All I could think was that of everyone I\u2019d met so far in Colby, she was the last person I ever would have thought I would end up with like this. Which reminded me of something else.</p><p>\u2018You know,\u2019 I said finally, \u2018Jake really was nothing to me. I\u2019m embarrassed I ever had anything to do with him.\u2019</p><p>She nodded slowly. \u2018He tends to have that effect on people.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Really, though. If I had it to do over...\u2019 I took in a breath. \u2018I wouldn\u2019t.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And you,\u2019 she said, stretching her legs out in front of her, \u2018were only with him for one night. Imagine wasting two years of your life, like I did.\u2019</p><p>I couldn\u2019t, of course. I\u2019d never even had a real boyfriend, even a crappy one. I said, \u2018You must have really loved him.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I did.\u2019 This was said simply, easily. The truth. \u2018I guess everyone has that, though, right?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Has what?\u2019</p><p>\u2018That first love. And the first one who breaks your heart. For me, they just happen to be the same person. At least I\u2019m efficient, right?\u2019 She reached into her bag, rummaging around again, before finally pulling out a pack of gum. She went to pull out a stick, then furrowed her brow. \u2018Empty. Time to hit the Gas/Gro.\u2019</p><p>I looked up at her as she got to her feet, brushing sand off herself before grabbing her bag. \u2018Well,\u2019 I said. \u2018Thanks. For checking in on me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re not coming?\u2019 she asked.</p><p>\u2018To the Gas/Gro?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Or wherever.\u2019 She hiked her bag over her shoulder. \u2018I mean, you can just sit here, I guess. But it seems kind of lonely. Especially if you\u2019re already feeling rotten.\u2019</p><p>I just sat there, looking at her for a moment. I felt like I should be honest, let her know that lonely actually appealed to me, even at my most rotten, and at times was actually preferable. But then I remembered how I\u2019d been feeling, sitting there watching the sun go down, and wondered if this was still true. Maybe. Maybe not. It seemed a lot to decide, right in that moment. So instead, I went with another truth, one that was never in doubt.</p><p>\u2018Well,\u2019 I said, \u2018I guess I could use some more coffee.\u2019</p><p>Then, somehow, I was standing up. Chucking my empty cup in a nearby trash can. And falling into step beside her, down the sand to the boardwalk, past the gathered tourists, to the Gas/Gro, where Esther and Leah were sitting outside on the bumper of a beat-up Jetta, waiting for us.</p><p>Now, I watched as Maggie grabbed a pack of cookies and her gum, and paused, her hand over the Twizzlers, before deciding against them. Esther, beside her, was studying a package of sunflower seeds.</p><p>\u2018All night I\u2019ve been thinking about these,\u2019 she said. \u2018But now, here in the moment, I\u2019m just not sure they have enough snack bang.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Snack bang?\u2019 I asked.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s the amount of taste and sustenance you get from any given snack,\u2019 Maggie explained as Leah grabbed a box of Tic Tacs, shaking them. \u2018So, like, sunflower seeds have very little. But beef jerky has tons.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I said, \u2018You know, I have to be honest. I just don\u2019t get this.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Get what?\u2019 Leah asked.</p><p>\u2018This whole obsession with stores, and snacks, and analyzing the minutiae of every single choice and pairing,\u2019 I said. \u2018What is that all about?\u2019</p><p>They all looked at one another. Then Esther said, \u2018I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s like, we\u2019re headed out somewhere. You never know what\u2019s going to happen. So you stop for supplies.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018The store-going comes first,\u2019 Maggie added, \u2018and then the adventure follows.\u2019</p><p>They headed for the register, and I grabbed a fresh cup, filling it up with GroRoast. It was simple: I required nothing else. But on my way to the register, I found myself suddenly reaching out to grab a pack of two chocolate cupcakes. I knew they were extraneous, highly caloric, a waste of money. And yet I had to wonder if they were right. When you don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going, maybe it wasn\u2019t such a bad thing to have more than you need.</p><p>\u2018Oh, God,\u2019 Esther groaned. \u2018Like we haven\u2019t been here before.\u2019</p><p>We were standing in the driveway of a big house right on the beach. There were people packed on the front steps, moving in shadows across lit-up windows, filling both decks and scattered across the sand below. Plus, there still were cars arriving, parking behind those already lining the narrow road and cluttering the cul-de-sac. In the two minutes we\u2019d been standing there, at least fifteen people had walked past us, heading in.</p><p>\u2018And because we have been here before,\u2019 Esther continued as a car drove by behind us, radio blaring, \u2018I vote that we leave now, while we still have our dignity.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I\u2019m not planning to be undignified,\u2019 Leah said, opening her Tic Tacs and popping one in her mouth. \u2018I just want to have a good time.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Same thing.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, for God\u2019s sake, it is not,\u2019 Leah said. \u2018Would you just relax, for once? This might be fun.\u2019</p><p>\u2018This kind of party is never fun,\u2019 Esther said. \u2018Unless you like having beer spilled on you, or some meaty guy grab your ass in some crowded hallway. Which, apparently, you do.\u2019</p><p>Leah sighed, blowing her hair out of her face. \u2018Look. Last night, I went to Club Caramel and sat there while that girl played the xylophone and sang ten songs about communism. And did I complain?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Maggie and Esther said in unison. Esther added, \u2018Loudly.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018But I went,\u2019 Leah continued, ignoring this. \u2018And in return, I got to choose what we did tonight. And I pick this. So let\u2019s go in.\u2019</p><p>She didn\u2019t wait for agreement, instead just pocketing her Tic Tacs and starting toward the house with long, confident strides. Esther followed along behind her, decidedly less enthusiastic, while Maggie glanced at me. \u2018It won\u2019t be that bad,\u2019 she said. \u2018I mean, it\u2019s just your typical weekend house party. You know.\u2019</p><p>I didn\u2019t, though. I had no idea, not that I was going to say so. I just followed Maggie up the driveway, taking care to step over the many beer cans that were littering the driveway and stairs.</p><p>Inside the house, the hallway was crowded, people packed in on either side. The only way through was navigating a narrow passage, single file, and even then it was a tight squeeze. It smelled like cologne and sweat and beer, an odor that just grew more potent the farther we proceeded. I tried to look straight ahead, but occasionally, out of the corner of my eye, I\u2019d see a guy watching me, his brow damp with sweat, or hear a voice say something \u2013 \u2018Hey baby, how you doing?\u2019 \u2013 maybe meant for me, or anyone.</p><p>We finally reached the living room, where there was a bit more breathing room, and a lot more people. Music was blaring from a stereo I couldn\u2019t see, and there was a group of people dancing off to one side, mostly girls, while a bunch of guys looked on. In the kitchen directly to my right, I could see a keg, as well as a bunch of various liquor bottles cluttering the counter by the sink. There was also, inexplicably, two trays of pastries: one of beautiful cupcakes, clearly hand-iced, each dotted with roses, and another of various bars \u2013 lemon, chocolate chip, raspberry \u2013 carefully arranged on tiny paper doilies.</p><p>Maggie, seeing me notice this, motioned for me to lean closer to her. Then she said, right in my ear, \u2018Belissa\u2019s parents own Sweet Petite bakery. This is her house.\u2019</p><p>She nodded toward a girl with long, dark hair streaked with blonde, wearing a white tank top and jeans, who was dancing with the group in the living room. She had her head thrown back, laughing, and her lipstick was bright, bright red, the same color as the tiny roses on each of the cupcakes.</p><p>\u2018We need beer,\u2019 Leah announced from Maggie\u2019s other side. She grabbed a couple of red cups from somewhere, then handed them to me. \u2018Here. You\u2019re closest.\u2019</p> <p>I looked down at the cups, then at the keg beside me. Leah and Maggie were now talking about something \u2013 Esther had vanished \u2013 so neither of them noticed me hesitate before turning to face the keg, where I assumed I was supposed to get the beer. It seemed simple enough, so I picked up the spigot attached to it and turned the top. Nothing happened.</p><p>I glanced around me. Leah and Maggie were still talking, and the only other people nearby \u2013 a couple, making out against the fridge \u2013 weren\u2019t paying me, or anything else, any attention. I twisted the top again \u2013 nothing \u2013 and felt my face flush, embarrassed. I had never been good at asking for help with anything, especially something that people assumed you already knew. And I knew plenty, but this simple, stupid thing was all new to me.</p><p>I took a breath, about to try again, when suddenly a hand appeared over mine, the fingers pressing down on the spigot, and beer began to fill the cup I was holding.</p><p>\u2018Let me guess,\u2019 Eli said, his voice that low, even timbre, as always. \u2018Drinking from kegs also falls under outdoor activity.\u2019</p><p>I just looked at him, standing there in jeans and the same blue hoodie he\u2019d had on the first time I met him. Maybe it was the embarrassment, which had been bad enough before I had an audience, but I was instantly annoyed. I said, \u2018Are we outside?\u2019</p><p>He glanced around, as if needing to confirm this. \u2018Nope.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Then no.\u2019 I turned my attention back to the keg.</p><p>He removed his hand from the spigot, then stood there watching me as I filled another cup. \u2018You know,\u2019 he said, \u2018I\u2019ve noticed you\u2019re kind of defensive.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And I,\u2019 I replied, \u2018have noticed that you are very judgmental.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Oh,\u2019 he said. \u2018So you\u2019re still upset about the bike thing.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know how to ride a bike!\u2019 I said.</p><p>\u2018But not how to work a keg.\u2019</p><p>I sighed. \u2018And you care about this because?\u2019</p> <p>He shrugged. \u2018It\u2019s kind of required here. Like buying more than one thing at the Gas/Gro.\u2019</p><p>I was impressed he remembered me saying this from the jump park \u2013 it was nice to be memorable, even in a somewhat embarrassing way \u2013 but I ignored him, instead moving to get Maggie\u2019s and Leah\u2019s attention so I could give them their beers. When I turned to them, though, they both were staring at me, their eyes wide. \u2018What?\u2019 I said, but they just took the cups, then stepped a bit farther away from me, exchanging a look as they each took a sip.</p><p>I moved back to the keg with the last cup, reaching to fill it. Once I had, they were still watching me with these weird expressions, so I just took a sip from my cup instead. The beer was warm and flat. Clearly, I had not been missing much.</p><p>Beside me, Eli was now studying the pastries, and I realized that maybe I had been a little short with him. In an attempt to be conciliatory, I said, \u2018Apparently the people who own this house have a bakery. Or something.\u2019</p><p>He glanced at me. \u2018Really.\u2019</p> <p>I took another sip, why I had no idea, as it tasted terrible. \u2018She\u2019s the girl in the white shirt, over there. With the red lipstick.\u2019</p><p>He glanced in the direction I indicated, watching the people dancing for a moment. \u2018Oh, right. I see her.\u2019</p><p>The girl was really moving now, her hair swishing down her back from side to side as she moved her hips in a circle, a pumped-up guy with, yes, hair gel pressing up behind her. \u2018Wow,\u2019 I said. \u2018That\u2019s really something.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Meaning what?\u2019</p><p>I shrugged. The girl glanced over at us, her eyes meeting mine, and I took another sip of my beer. \u2018Just... sometimes less is more. You know?\u2019</p><p>He sort of smiled, as if this was cute, which was kind of annoying. I glanced over at Maggie and Leah, who, for some reason, were now looking at me totally goggle-eyed.</p> <p>\u2018Which is not to say,\u2019 I said to Eli, \u2018you shouldn\u2019t have one of her cupcakes. They look great.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nah,\u2019 he said. \u2018I\u2019ll pass.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You know,\u2019 I told him, \u2018if you don\u2019t know how to eat a cupcake, that\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of.\u2019</p><p>Now he did smile. \u2018I know how to eat a cupcake.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sure you do.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I do,\u2019 he said. \u2018I just don\u2019t want one of those.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah?\u2019 I put my cup down, then reached into my bag for the packaged ones I\u2019d bought at the Gas/Gro, pulling them out and placing them on the counter between us. \u2018Prove it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You really want me to?\u2019 he asked.</p> <p>\u2018It\u2019s kind of required here,\u2019 I said. \u2018Like riding a bike.\u2019</p><p>He studied my face for a second, then picked up the pack of cupcakes, opening it and pulling one out. I was watching him, about to take another sip of beer, when I felt a hand suddenly clench my arm. \u2018Abort,\u2019 Maggie hissed in my ear. \u2018Abort, abort, right now.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 I said, but I barely got the word out before she was yanking me sideways, past Eli \u2013 who was chewing, watching us \u2013 and out onto the back deck, where Leah was clearing a path through the people there.</p><p>\u2018Hurry,\u2019 she yelled over her shoulder, and Maggie nodded, still dragging me behind her. \u2018I think if we go down the stairs this way, we can get out faster and maybe avoid this.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Right,\u2019 Maggie replied, \u2018let\u2019s definitely avoid this.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What are you guys talking about?\u2019 I asked as Maggie dragged me down a short flight of stairs to a lower deck, which was a bit less crowded. \u2018Avoid what?\u2019</p><p>She turned, as if to answer me, but didn\u2019t get the chance. Because right then, a glass door to our right slid open, and the girl from the dance floor \u2013 Miss Red Lipstick, cupcake, less is not more \u2013 appeared, planting herself squarely in our path. Two of the girls she\u2019d been dancing with, a redhead in a black dress and a shorter, pudgy blonde girl, spilled out behind her.</p><p>\u2018Okay,\u2019 she said, holding up both hands, palms facing us. Her voice was kind of nasal, thin. \u2018What just happened in there? And who the hell is this?\u2019</p><p>She was looking right at me, as were both her friends, and I felt myself break into a cold sweat, instantly, something that I\u2019d read about but never actually experienced before in my entire life. Maggie, releasing her hold on my arm, said, \u2018Belissa, it\u2019s really nothing.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nothing?\u2019 Belissa took a step toward me. Up close, I could see the bumpy texture of her skin, how her nose was a little pointier than she probably liked. \u2018What\u2019s your name, skank?\u2019</p><p>At first, I thought this was both a question \u2013 what\u2019s your name? \u2013 and an answer. Then I realized she was actually waiting for a response. \u2018Auden,\u2019 I said.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u2018Auden,\u2019 she repeated, the way you\u2019d say scrotum or excrement. \u2018What kind of a name is that?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well \u2013\u2019 I said.</p><p>\u2018It doesn\u2019t matter,\u2019 Leah said, cutting me off. \u2018Like Maggie said, nothing happened.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Was she, or was she not, in there hitting on Eli?\u2019 Belissa demanded.</p><p>\u2018She wasn\u2019t,\u2019 Leah said, her voice flat. Certain. The blonde and the redhead exchanged looks. \u2018She\u2019s not from here, she doesn\u2019t know anybody.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Or anything,\u2019 Maggie added, sounding less confident. Belissa glanced at her. \u2018You know what I mean.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I saw how he was talking to her,\u2019 Belissa said. It was weird how she was staring at me, and yet at the same time ignoring me completely. \u2018He was smiling, for God\u2019s sakes.\u2019</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s not allowed to smile?\u2019 Leah asked. Maggie shot her a look, and she added, \u2018Look, Belissa, it was an honest mistake, and we\u2019re leaving. Okay?\u2019</p><p>Belissa considered this, then stepped even closer to me. \u2018I don\u2019t know who you are,\u2019 she said, punctuating this with a jab of her finger, the tip touching my chest. \u2018And I don\u2019t really care. But you better stay away from my boy-friend, especially when you\u2019re under my roof. Understood?\u2019</p><p>I looked past her, to Maggie, who nodded, her head bobbing wildly. I said, \u2018All right.\u2019</p><p>\u2018All right,\u2019 Belissa repeated. Behind her, Leah sighed, looking up at the sky. \u2018Now get off my property.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And with that, Maggie was yanking my arm again, dragging me down the nearby stairs. She continued her death grip on me as we followed Leah down to the beach, around a dune, and then over a public walkway, back to the street, not letting go until we were back at the car, where Esther was waiting.</p><p>\u2018Where the hell have you been?\u2019 Leah demanded. \u2018We could have used you back there.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Let me guess,\u2019 Esther said as Maggie and I got in the backseat. \u2018Something undignified happened.\u2019</p><p>\u2018If you call Auden just about getting all our asses kicked undignified, then yes,\u2019 Leah told her. She slammed her door shut, then turned around in her seat to look at me. \u2018Are you crazy? Flirting with Eli Stock in front of Belissa Norwood, in Belissa Norwood\u2019s house, while eating Belissa Norwood\u2019s cupcakes?\u2019</p> <p>They were all looking at me now. I said, \u2018We weren\u2019t eating those cupcakes.\u2019</p><p>Leah threw her hands up, turning back around as Esther cranked the engine. Maggie, beside me, said, \u2018You guys, she didn\u2019t know about any of that.\u2019</p><p>\u2018She didn\u2019t know about you and Jake, either,\u2019 Leah said. \u2018But that didn\u2019t stop you from wanting to flatten her when she hooked up with him.\u2019</p><p>\u2018True,\u2019 Maggie said. \u2018But, like Belissa, I was in the wrong. She and Eli are broken up. He can talk to whoever he wants.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But that\u2019s just the point,\u2019 Leah told her, turning to face me. \u2018Eli doesn\u2019t talk. To anyone. Ever. So why is he talking to her?\u2019</p> <p>No one said anything. Finally, I cleared my throat and said, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t know. He just does, ever since this one night when I saw him riding his bike.\u2019</p><p>Silence. They were all staring at me, even Esther, who used the rearview. Maggie said softly, \u2018You saw Eli on a bike? What was he doing?\u2019</p><p>I shrugged. \u2018I don\u2019t know. Tricks? He was jumping around, at the end of the boardwalk.\u2019</p><p>Maggie and Leah looked at each other. \u2018You know,\u2019 Leah said, \u2018I think maybe...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Agreed,\u2019 Esther said, hitting her turn signal as the Gas/ Gro came up in the distance. \u2018We definitely need some snack bang for this one.\u2019</p><p>\u2018The thing is,\u2019 Maggie began, \u2018if we\u2019re going to tell you about Eli, first we have to tell you about Abe.\u2019</p> <p>We were at the very tip of the pier, lined up on a bench and looking out over the water. On the way out to the end, we\u2019d passed several fishermen, standing with their rods leaning over the side, focused on the water. Here, we were all alone, except for the wind and the splashing below.</p><p>\u2018Abe and Eli,\u2019 Maggie said, \u2018were inseparable. Best friends since, like, kindergarten. You hardly ever saw them apart.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But they were totally different,\u2019 Esther added. \u2018You know, Eli\u2019s got that dark, quiet thing going on. And Abe was...\u2019</p><p>They were all quiet for a moment. Then Leah said, \u2018A total goofball.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Total,\u2019 Maggie agreed. \u2018Like, the silliest person you have ever met. He could make anybody laugh.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Even Eli.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Especially Eli.\u2019 Leah smiled. \u2018God, do you even remember what Eli was like before Abe died? He was actually... funny.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Abe died?\u2019 I said.</p> <p>Maggie nodded solemnly, opening up a pack of gum. \u2018It was May of last year. He and Eli were down in Brockton, at this event at Concrete Jungle? They were both sponsored, had been for a couple of years now. They both started out straight BMX, you know, but then Eli took up the half-pipe, and Abe stuck more to flatland, at least in competition. But they were both really good at urban, although that\u2019s not surprising, considering where we\u2019re from.\u2019</p><p>I just looked at her. Leah said, \u2018Maggie, nobody here but you understands all that bike shit. Speak English.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, sorry.\u2019 Maggie pulled out a piece of gum, popping it in her mouth. \u2018Eli and Abe were both really, really good at riding bikes. So good they got paid to go around and compete at various events, and that\u2019s why they were in Brockton.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And it was after the event,\u2019 Esther said, \u2018when they were driving back from a party, that the accident happened.\u2019</p><p>\u2018The accident,\u2019 I said.</p><p>Leah nodded. \u2018Eli was driving. And Abe was killed.\u2019</p><p>I heard myself gasp. \u2018Oh, my God.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know.\u2019 Maggie folded the gum wrapper she was holding, first once, then twice, down to a tiny square. \u2018I was with Jake when Eli called. We were at his house, and I could hear Eli on the phone. He was at the hospital, and he was trying to talk, but all I could hear was this awful sound he was making...\u2019</p><p>She didn\u2019t finish, instead just looked out over the water, dark on either side of us. Esther said, \u2018It wasn\u2019t his fault. They were going through a four-way stop, and someone just ran it and hit them.\u2019</p><p>\u2018A drunk,\u2019 Leah added.</p><p>Esther nodded. \u2018It tore Eli up, big-time. It was like Abe took some part of him when he went, you know? He\u2019s never been the same.\u2019</p><p>\u2018He gave up all his sponsorships, the riding, everything,\u2019 Maggie said. \u2018He\u2019d gotten into college at the U and deferred to keep competing, but he didn\u2019t go there either. He just got a job managing the bike shop and stopped riding altogether.\u2019</p><p>Leah glanced at me. \u2018Or so we thought.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I just saw him doing it that one night on the boardwalk,\u2019 I told her. \u2018It was really late. Or early, actually.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well,\u2019 Maggie said, \u2018I guess that means something. What, I don\u2019t know. But something.\u2019</p><p>There was a sudden burst of noise from behind us: when I turned, I saw one of the fishermen pulling something over the rail of the pier. It was flopping, catching the light here and there, before he eased it down behind a tackle box, out of sight. The other people fishing took note, then returned to their own lines.</p><p>\u2018And Belissa,\u2019 I said, warming my hands around my cup. \u2018What\u2019s the story there?\u2019</p><p>\u2018They\u2019d dated since sophomore year,\u2019 Leah told me. \u2018She stuck with him through the funeral, and a couple of months after, but eventually things just fell apart. She dumped him, is what I heard. Although apparently she sees it differently.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Apparently,\u2019 I said.</p><p>Leah smiled, shaking her head. \u2018I swear, when she asked you what kind of a name that was, and you were about to answer her... I almost just took off running and left you there to fend for yourself.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018She asked me a question,\u2019 I said.</p><p>\u2018She didn\u2019t want an answer, though.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, then why did she ask?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Because,\u2019 Leah said, \u2018she was gearing up to smacking your face. God! Don\u2019t you know anything about dealing with jealous ex-girlfriends?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018No,\u2019 I said. \u2018Not really.\u2019</p><p>Maggie smiled. \u2018Well, you just got a crash course, then.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Crash being the operative word,\u2019 Leah added. \u2018I mean, did you see how pissed off she was? And then she tells you to get lost, or else, and you say...\u2019</p><p>\u2018\u201cAll right,\u201d\u2019 Maggie said.</p><p>Esther\u2019s eyes widened. \u2018No.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018She totally did. And said it just like that, too. Like she was doing her a favor by agreeing.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I did not,\u2019 I said. Leah and Maggie just looked at me. \u2018Did I?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yup.\u2019 Leah shook her cup, then took another sip off her straw. \u2018Which was either incredibly ballsy, or incredibly stupid. I\u2019m still not sure which.\u2019</p><p>Esther laughed, and I just sat there, looking down at my coffee and remembering how completely out of my element I\u2019d been at that party, and that moment. Never before had it been so obvious that although I\u2019d spent my entire life learning, there was a lot of stuff I still didn\u2019t know. Enough to get me into big trouble, apparently, if someone hadn\u2019t been there to help me out.</p><p>\u2018It was stupid,\u2019 I said out loud, thinking this. They all looked at me. \u2018I mean, what I said. The truth is, I didn\u2019t have much of a social life in high school. Or ever, for that matter.\u2019</p><p>This was greeted with an extended silence. Or maybe it just felt that way to me.</p> <p>\u2018You know,\u2019 Leah said, \u2018that actually explains a lot.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It does,\u2019 Maggie agreed.</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u2019 I asked.</p><p>\u2018Nothing,\u2019 she said quickly. Then, glancing at Leah, she added, \u2018I mean, just how you came to town, and hooked up with Jake right away, and then were surprised when people, um, drew conclusions about you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And by people,\u2019 Leah said, \u2018she means us.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Got that,\u2019 I replied. \u2018Thanks.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Plus,\u2019 Esther added, \u2018there\u2019s the way you\u2019ve always kept to yourself.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Except for tonight,\u2019 Leah pointed out.</p> <p>\u2018Except for tonight,\u2019 Maggie agreed. \u2018I mean, we just figured you thought you were better than us. But maybe you just didn\u2019t know how to hang out.\u2019</p><p>I wanted to believe it was the latter. But I knew in my heart of hearts, my truest place, that I had assumed my superiority. In Maggie\u2019s case, with a single glance.</p><p>\u2018Like I said,\u2019 Leah said, \u2018only a girl who didn\u2019t have any real girlfriends would actually begin to answer the question, \u201cWhat kind of a name is that?\u201d\u2019</p><p>\u2018I thought she wanted to know!\u2019 I said.</p><p>\u2018I doubt Belissa Norwood has much interest in learning about the life of a modern poet famous for his works on politics, nature, and unrequited love,\u2019 Maggie said.</p><p>I turned, facing her. \u2018You know about Auden?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I wrote my senior thesis on the use of loss in his poems,\u2019 she replied. \u2018It\u2019s what got me into Defriese. Hey, Leah, you have any Tic Tacs left?\u2019</p><p>I just sat there, stunned into silence as Leah pulled out the pack, passing it to her. I\u2019d had a lot of surprises that day: my mom showing up, almost getting my butt kicked, and learning about Eli\u2019s past. But this was the thing that left me speechless. Maggie was going to Defriese. Just like me.</p><p>\u2018Shoot,\u2019 Esther said, glancing at her watch. \u2018It\u2019s past midnight. I better get home. Who needs a ride?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I guess I do,\u2019 Leah said, standing up and wiping off her jeans with her hands, \u2018considering I didn\u2019t get to meet some hot guy to drive me home from that party.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sorry,\u2019 I said.</p><p>\u2018Oh, she\u2019ll survive,\u2019 Esther said, sliding her arm around Leah\u2019s shoulders as we started back down the pier. \u2018Tomorrow night, we\u2019ll go to Bentley\u2019s for open mike, and maybe you can find yourself a nice, greasy artist type there.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Maybe I will,\u2019 Leah replied, \u2018just to spite you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What about you, Auden?\u2019 Maggie asked, falling into step beside me. \u2018You want a ride back to Heidi\u2019s?\u2019</p><p>I looked down the pier to the boardwalk and the road beyond it, the streetlights breaking up the dark. \u2018Nah,\u2019 I said. \u2018I think I\u2019ll grab some more coffee before I head home.\u2019</p><p>\u2018More coffee?\u2019 Esther said, eyeing my cup. \u2018Doesn\u2019t that keep you up, though?\u2019</p><p>I shook my head. \u2018Nope. It doesn\u2019t.\u2019</p><p>At the end of the pier, we said our good-byes, and they headed back to the car. I could hear them still talking, their voices carried by the wind, as I turned and started in the other direction, back to the Gas/Gro, where I was the only customer as I filled up a fresh cup, adding milk, a stirrer, and, after a moment of consideration, a candy bar. The cashier, an older woman with blonde hair and a name tag that said WANDA, was working on a crossword. She put it down, then rang me up while stifling a yawn.</p><p>\u2018Late night,\u2019 she said as I slid my money across to her.</p><p>\u2018Aren\u2019t they all,\u2019 I replied.</p><p>Out in the parking lot, the wind was warm and blowing hard, and for a moment I just closed my eyes and stood there, feeling it on my face. Earlier that night, I\u2019d taken off to be alone, only to find \u2013 to my surprise \u2013 that company was just what I needed. Still, I knew it must have been hard for Maggie to come looking for me, not knowing how I\u2019d react when I saw her. The easiest thing would have been to just leave me alone. But she didn\u2019t go for the easiest thing.</p><p>I was a girl who liked a challenge, too. Or at least I liked to think of myself that way. So I went looking for Eli.</p><p>On the way to the boardwalk, I passed a cop, driving slowly, his radio crackling. Two girls, arm in arm, one stumbling, the other pulling her forward. The bars still had an hour or so left until closing, with people and music spilling out their open doors. Farther down into the business district, though, all the stores were dark. But in the bike shop, way in back, a light was on.</p><p>I raised my hand to knock, then dropped it, reconsidering. So I\u2019d spent a night in the world of girls, big deal. Did it really mean anything had changed, especially me? As I stood there, debating this, I saw someone move across the lit, open back door of the shop: dark hair, blue shirt. Before I knew what I was doing, my hand was rapping the glass, hard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Eli looked up, his face wary. When he came closer and saw it was me, he didn\u2019t really look relieved. Or surprised, actually. He unlocked the door, pushing it open. \u2018Let me guess,\u2019 he said. \u2018You want to learn to ride a bike, and it can\u2019t wait until morning.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 I said. He dropped his hand from the door, and just stood there, looking at me. I realized he was waiting for me to explain myself. \u2018I was in the neighborhood, saw the light.\u2019 I held up my coffee, as if this proved something. \u2018Long night, and all that.\u2019</p><p>He studied my face for a moment. \u2018Right,\u2019 he said finally. \u2018Well, come on in.\u2019</p><p>I stepped through the door, and he shut it, locking it behind me. I followed him through the dark shop to the back, which was some kind of repair area. There were parts of bikes up on stands, wheels leaning against workbenches, a pile of gears on a table, tools everywhere. In one corner, where a bike was partially assembled, a handwritten sign said ADAM\u2019S WORKSPACE \u2013 TOUCH AND DIE! with a skull and crossbones underneath it.</p> <p>\u2018Have a seat,\u2019 Eli said, waving a hand at a stool right beside this.</p><p>\u2018Seems dangerous.\u2019</p><p>He glanced at the sign, then rolled his eyes. \u2018It\u2019s not.\u2019</p><p>I sat down, my cup in hand, as he slid behind a nearby cluttered desk, which was piled with papers, various bike parts, and, not surprisingly, a collection of empty soda bottles and various convenience-store items. \u2018So,\u2019 he said, picking up an envelope and glancing at it, \u2018you say you\u2019re not here for a bike.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 I said.</p> <p>\u2018Then what? You\u2019re just out walking the boardwalk in the middle of the night?\u2019</p><p>Eli doesn\u2019t talk, Leah had said. To anyone. Ever. But he had to me, and maybe that did mean something, even if it wasn\u2019t clear just what.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 I said. \u2018I just... I thought you might want to talk, or something.\u2019</p><p>Eli shut the drawer, slowly, and looked at me. The click noise it made seemed very loud. \u2018Talk,\u2019 he said, his voice flat.</p><p>\u2018Yeah.\u2019 He was just sitting there, staring at me, expressionless, and I felt not unlike when my mom got me in her sights, a serious squirm coming on. \u2018You\u2019re up, I\u2019m up. I just figured...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, I get it,\u2019 he said, nodding. \u2018Right. You know now.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Know...\u2019 I said.</p><p>He shook his head. \u2018I should have known when I saw you at the door. Not to mention at that party. Maggie isn\u2019t exactly known for holding back information.\u2019</p><p>I just sat there, not sure what to do. I said, \u2018Look, I\u2019m sorry. I just thought...\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know what you thought.\u2019 He picked up a stack of papers, rifling through it. \u2018And I appreciate you wanting to help me, or whatever. But I don\u2019t need it. Okay?\u2019</p><p>I nodded numbly. Suddenly the room seemed too bright, illuminating every single one of my failings. I slid off the stool. \u2018I should go,\u2019 I said. \u2018It\u2019s late.\u2019</p><p>Eli looked over at me. I remembered how that first night, I\u2019d thought of him as haunted, before I even knew this was true. He said, \u2018Do you want to know why I talk to you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah,\u2019 I said. \u2018I do.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Because,\u2019 he said, \u2018from that first day on the boardwalk, you were different. You never tiptoed around me, or acted all weird and sorry for me, or gave me that look.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018What look?\u2019</p><p>\u2018That one,\u2019 he said, pointing at my face. I felt myself blush. \u2018You were just... normal. Until tonight.\u2019</p><p>Until tonight, I thought, hearing Maggie and Esther saying these same words, only an hour earlier. Eli was still rummaging around in the drawer, his head ducked, and I thought of him that day on the pier with Thisbe, how easily he\u2019d reached down to pick her up. There are a lot of ways to comfort someone. The elevator was only one of the unexpected ones.</p><p>\u2018You know,\u2019 I said, leaning against the doorjamb, \u2018I\u2019m actually really relieved to hear you say that. Because I don\u2019t want to feel sorry for you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You don\u2019t,\u2019 he said, not looking up.</p><p>\u2018Nope. The truth is, I\u2019m actually kind of angry with you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Angry?\u2019 I nodded. He lifted his head: now, I had his attention. \u2018And why is that?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Because you almost got my ass kicked tonight.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I did?\u2019</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u2018Like you didn\u2019t know that was your girlfriend I was talking about,\u2019 I told him. \u2018Not to mention looking at while I was talking about.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hold on,\u2019 he said. \u2018She\u2019s \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018You just let me stand there and shoot off my mouth,\u2019 I continued, ignoring this, \u2018and then, when she came after me...\u2019</p><p>\u2018She came after you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018She poked me in the chest and called me a skank,\u2019 I said. He raised his eyebrows. \u2018And meanwhile, you\u2019re off eating cupcakes somewhere.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Excuse me,\u2019 he said, pushing the drawer shut, \u2018but you were the one who told me to eat the cupcakes.\u2019</p><p>\u2018When I didn\u2019t know my life was in danger!\u2019 I sighed. \u2018All I\u2019m saying is that you kind of left me out there to fend for myself. Which was not very cool.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Look,\u2019 he said, \u2018Belissa is not my girlfriend.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You might want to tell her that,\u2019 I replied. \u2018If you can, you know, make time during all that cupcake eating.\u2019</p><p>Eli was just looking at me, his expression hard to read, and again I felt like squirming. But not for the same reasons. At all.</p><p>\u2018What are you really doing out so late?\u2019 he asked.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t sleep at night.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why not?\u2019</p><p>\u2018It used to be because my parents were up fighting,\u2019 I said. \u2018But now... I don\u2019t know.\u2019</p><p>This answer was like a reflex, coming without thinking. Eli nodded, then said, \u2018So what do you do to pass the time? Other than not riding bikes.\u2019</p><p>I shrugged. \u2018Read. Drive. At home, I have a twenty-four-hour diner I really like, but here there\u2019s only the Wheelhouse, which is less than ideal.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ve been going to the Wheelhouse?\u2019 He shook his head. \u2018The coffee there is terrible.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know. Plus the waitresses are mean.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And it\u2019s not like you\u2019re taking up a table someone else wants.\u2019 He sighed. \u2018You should be going where I go. Open twenty-four/seven, great coffee, and pie.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Really,\u2019 I said. \u2018That\u2019s the trifecta.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Wait, though,\u2019 I said. \u2018I have Googled every single restaurant for fifty miles, and nothing came up but the Wheelhouse.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That,\u2019 he said, \u2018is because my place is a local secret.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Oh, right.\u2019 I leaned back against the doorjamb. \u2018Of course. The local thing again.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yep,\u2019 he said, reaching down to grab a canvas bag from beside the desk, and hoisting it over his shoulder. \u2018But don\u2019t worry. I think I can get you in.\u2019</p><p>\u2018This,\u2019 I said, \u2018is not a restaurant.\u2019</p><p>That much was obvious by the row of coin-operated washing machines on one side of the room, the dryers on the other. Not to mention the tables lined up for folding in between, a few plastic chairs, and a machine dispensing small boxes of detergent and fabric softener with an OUT OF ORDER sign taped over it.</p><p>\u2018I didn\u2019t say it was a restaurant,\u2019 Eli said as he walked over to a machine, plopping his canvas bag down on top of it.</p> <p>\u2018You didn\u2019t say it was a Laundromat,\u2019 I pointed out.</p><p>\u2018True.\u2019 He pulled a bottle of Tide out of the bag, then dumped the bag\u2019s contents inside. After he fed in some quarters, and water began to slosh across the glass front, sudsing immediately, he said, \u2018Follow me.\u2019</p><p>I did, albeit hesitantly, down the row of washers and dryers to a narrow hallway, which ended with a plain, white door. He knocked twice, then pulled it open, gesturing for me to go through first. Initially, I hesitated. But then, sure enough, I smelled coffee. And that was enough to push me over the threshold.</p><p>Which, honestly, was like stepping into a different world. Gone was the linoleum and shiny appliances. This place was dim, the walls painted a deep purple. There was one window, a string of multicolored lights tacked up over it, and a few small tables. Right by the back door, which was open, a warm breeze blowing through, was a small counter. An older guy with black hair streaked with white was sitting behind it, reading a magazine. When he looked up and saw Eli, he smiled.</p><p>\u2018Yo,\u2019 he called out. \u2018I thought you might turn up tonight.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I was running out of shirts,\u2019 Eli replied.</p> <p>\u2018Well, then.\u2019 The guy put his magazine aside, then stood up, rubbing his hands together. \u2018What can I get for you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018That depends,\u2019 Eli said, walking over to the counter and pulling out a stool. I was about to do the same when he gestured at it, and I realized it was for me. \u2018What\u2019s on the menu?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well,\u2019 the guy said, stepping back from the counter and looking beneath it, \u2018let\u2019s see... there\u2019s some rhubarb. Apple. And some razzleberry.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Razzleberry?\u2019</p><p>The guy nodded. \u2018Raspberry and blueberry. Sort of tart, sort of mellow. It\u2019s a little intense. But worth trying.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sounds good.\u2019 Eli glanced at me. \u2018What do you want?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Coffee?\u2019 I said.</p><p>\u2018Just coffee?\u2019 the guy asked.</p> <p>\u2018She\u2019s not from here,\u2019 Eli explained. To me he said, \u2018Trust me. You want pie.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh.\u2019 They were both looking at me. I said, \u2018Um, apple, then.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Good choice,\u2019 Eli said as the guy turned around, grabbing two mugs from a rack behind him and filling them from a nearby coffeepot. Then, as we watched, he pulled two plates out from under the counter, followed by two pies. He cut hefty slices of each, arranged them neatly with a fork beside, and them pushed them over to us.</p><p>I picked up my mug first, taking a tiny sip. Eli hadn\u2019t been joking after all: the coffee was incredible. But not as good as the pie. Sweet Jesus.</p><p>\u2018I told you,\u2019 Eli said. \u2018Beats the Wheelhouse by a mile.\u2019</p><p>\u2018The Wheelhouse? Who\u2019s eating there?\u2019 the guy said. Eli nodded at me. \u2018Oh, man. I hate to hear that.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Clyde,\u2019 Eli said to me, \u2018is a man who takes pie very seriously.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well,\u2019 Clyde said, flattered, \u2018I mean, I endeavor to. But I\u2019m only a beginner at this whole baking thing. I got a late start.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Clyde owns the bike shop,\u2019 Eli told me. \u2018And this Laundromat. And about four other businesses here in Colby. He\u2019s a mogul.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I prefer the term renaissance man,\u2019 Clyde said as he picked up his magazine again, which, I saw now, was a copy of Gourmet. \u2018And just because I\u2019m good at business does not mean I can do a perfect piecrust. Or so I\u2019m learning.\u2019</p><p>I took another bite of the pie \u2013 which tasted pretty close to perfect to me, actually \u2013 and looked around the room again.</p><p>\u2018You have to admit,\u2019 Eli said as Clyde flipped a page, studying a recipe for potatoes au gratin, \u2018this is better than driving or reading.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Much,\u2019 I agreed.</p><p>\u2018She doesn\u2019t sleep either,\u2019 Eli told Clyde, who nodded. To me he said, \u2018Clyde bought this place just so he\u2019d have something to do at night.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yep,\u2019 Clyde said. \u2018The coffee shop part, though, that was Eli\u2019s idea.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nah,\u2019 Eli said, shaking his head.</p><p>\u2018It was.\u2019 Clyde turned another page. \u2018Used to be, we\u2019d just hang out during the spin cycle, share a thermos and whatever pastry I was working on. Then he convinced me maybe we weren\u2019t the only ones looking for a place to go other than a bar late at night.\u2019</p><p>Eli poked his fork into his piecrust. \u2018Spin cycle,\u2019 he said. \u2018That\u2019s not a bad one, actually.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Huh.\u2019 Clyde considered this. \u2018You\u2019re right. Write it down.\u2019</p><p>Eli pulled out his wallet, then took out a piece of yellow folded paper. From the looks of it, it was a list, and a long one. Clyde handed him a pen, and I watched as he added SPIN CYCLE to the bottom.</p><p>\u2018We need a new name for the bike shop,\u2019 Clyde explained to me. \u2018We\u2019ve been trying to come up with one for ages.\u2019</p><p>I had a flash of my first day in Colby, the conversation I\u2019d heard among Jake, Wallace, and Adam as I passed them on the boardwalk. \u2018What\u2019s it called now?\u2019</p><p>\u2018The Bike Shop,\u2019 Eli said, his voice flat. I raised my eyebrows. \u2018Nice, right?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Actually, it\u2019s called Clyde\u2019s Rides,\u2019 Clyde said, picking up my coffee mug to refill it. \u2018But the sign got blown off during Hurricane Beatrice last year, and when I went to replace it, I thought maybe it was time to give it a new name...\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018... which we\u2019ve been trying to do ever since,\u2019 Eli said. \u2018Clyde can\u2019t make up his mind.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll know it when I hear it,\u2019 Clyde said, hardly bothered. \u2018Until then, it\u2019s fine if everyone calls it the Bike Shop. Because that\u2019s what it is. Right?\u2019</p><p>A phone rang behind him then, and he turned to grab it. As he stepped outside, the receiver pressed to his ear, Eli turned to look at me. \u2018What did I tell you?\u2019 he said. \u2018Pretty good, huh?\u2019</p><p>\u2018It is,\u2019 I agreed. \u2018And you\u2019re right. I never would have found this place in a million years.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Nope,\u2019 he said.</p><p>We sat there for a minute, eating. On the other side of the wall, I could hear a load bumping through a drying cycle, thump thump thump. My watch said two fifteen. \u2018So,\u2019 I said. \u2018What else you got?\u2019</p><p>I\u2019d thought I was pretty good at both staying up and staying productive. But Eli was the master.</p><p>After the Laundromat, we got back into his car \u2013 an old Toyota truck with a cab on it, the back of which was filled with bike parts that clanked and rattled with every turn \u2013 then headed fifteen miles west, to the twenty-four-hour Park Mart. There you could, at three A.M., not only buy groceries, linens, and small appliances, but also get your tires rotated, if you so desired. As we walked the aisles, a cart between us, we talked. Not about Abe. But about almost everything else.</p><p>\u2018So, Defriese,\u2019 he said as he compared brands of microwave popcorn. \u2018Isn\u2019t that where Maggie\u2019s going?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I think so,\u2019 I said as he pulled down a box, examining it.</p><p>\u2018Must be a really good school, then. That girl\u2019s brilliant.\u2019 I didn\u2019t say anything, and a moment later he added, \u2018So I guess that makes you brilliant, too, huh?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yep,\u2019 I said. \u2018Pretty much.\u2019</p><p>He raised an eyebrow at me, sticking the popcorn in our cart. \u2018If you\u2019re such a brain, though,\u2019 he said, \u2018how come you didn\u2019t know not to flirt with another girl\u2019s boyfriend in her own kitchen?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m book smart,\u2019 I said. \u2018Not street smart.\u2019</p><p>Eli made a face. \u2018I wouldn\u2019t exactly call Belissa street. She gets her jeans dry-cleaned.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Really?\u2019</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u2018Wow.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know.\u2019</p><p>We walked down the aisle a bit. He didn\u2019t seem to have a list and yet still knew exactly what he wanted. \u2018Seriously, though,\u2019 I said. \u2018You\u2019re right. I was kind of...\u2019</p><p>I trailed off, and he didn\u2019t jump in, pushing me to finish. I was finding that I liked that.</p><p>\u2018I guess,\u2019 I said, \u2018that I just missed a lot in high school. Like, socially.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I doubt it,\u2019 he replied, stopping to throw a roll of paper towels in the cart. \u2018A lot of that stuff is overrated.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018You can say that because you were popular, though.\u2019</p><p>He glanced at me as we turned the corner, to the soup aisle. Halfway down, a guy in a long coat was muttering to himself. That was the one thing about being out so late, or early. The crazies were, too. Watching Eli, I saw he had the same attitude about it that I did, which was three pronged: don\u2019t stare, keep a wide berth, and act normal. \u2018What makes you think I was popular?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, come on,\u2019 I said. \u2018You were a bike pro. You had to be.\u2019</p><p>\u2018For all you know,\u2019 he replied, \u2018I was a nerdy bike pro.\u2019</p><p>I just looked at him.</p><p>\u2018Okay, fine. I wasn\u2019t exactly a wallflower.\u2019 He grabbed a can of tomato rice soup off the shelf, then another. \u2018But big deal. It\u2019s not like it makes a difference in the long run.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I think maybe it does.\u2019 I leaned over the cart, looking down into it. \u2018I mean, I did all the academic stuff. But I never had that many friends. So there\u2019s a lot I don\u2019t know.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Like...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Like not to talk to a girl\u2019s boyfriend in her own kitchen.\u2019</p><p>We moved out of the aisle away from the guy in the coat, who was still muttering, and headed to the dairy section, passing a sleepy-looking employee restocking cold cuts along the way. \u2018Well,\u2019 he said, \u2018nothing like almost getting your ass kicked to hammer a lesson home. You\u2019re not likely to forget it now.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah,\u2019 I said. \u2018But what about everything else?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Such as?\u2019</p><p>I shrugged, leaning over the cart as he pulled out some milk, checking the expiration date. Watching him, I thought, not for the first time that night, that maybe it should have felt strange to be with him, here, now. And yet it didn\u2019t, at all. That was one of the things about the night. Stuff that would be weird in the bright light of day just wasn\u2019t so much once you passed a certain hour. It was like the dark just evened it all out somehow. I said, \u2018I just think that it\u2019s too late, maybe. All the things I should have been doing over the last eighteen years, like going to slumber parties, or breaking curfew on Friday night, or \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Riding a bike,\u2019 he said.</p><p>I stopped pushing the cart. \u2018What is it,\u2019 I said, \u2018with you and the whole bike thing?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, I am in the business. Plus, it\u2019s a big part of growing up,\u2019 he replied, moving down to the cheese display. \u2018And it\u2019s not too late.\u2019</p><p>I didn\u2019t say anything as we headed toward the registers, where one girl was standing by the only one that was open, examining her split ends.</p><p>\u2018Of course,\u2019 Eli said as he began unloading the cart onto the belt, \u2018it\u2019s not too late for slumber parties or any of that other stuff either. But breaking curfew I think you can go ahead and knock off your list.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Because it\u2019s past four A.M. and you\u2019re at the Park Mart,\u2019 he said as the girl began to scan the groceries. \u2018It counts, I think.\u2019</p><p>I considered this as I watched some apples roll down the belt. \u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 I said. \u2018Maybe you\u2019re right, and all that stuff I think I missed is overrated. Why should I even bother? What\u2019s the point, really?\u2019</p><p>He thought for a moment. \u2018Who says there has to be a point?\u2019 he asked. \u2018Or a reason. Maybe it\u2019s just something you have to do.\u2019</p><p>He moved down to start bagging while I just stood there, letting this sink in. Just something you have to do. No excuse or rationale necessary. I kind of liked that.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>From Park Mart, we headed over to Lumber and Stone, the home improvement superstore, which Eli informed me opened early for contractors. Which we were not, but they didn\u2019t seem to care, letting us walk right in. I tagged along as Eli stocked up on a new wrench set, a box of nails, and a value pack of lightbulbs: while he checked out, I sat on a bench by the front door, watching the sun begin to rise over the parking lot. By the time we left, it was almost six, and the rest of the world was finally waking up to join us.</p><p>\u2018I saw that,\u2019 he said as I stifled a yawn while sliding into the front seat of his car.</p><p>\u2018This,\u2019 I said, \u2018is about the time I usually crash.\u2019</p><p>\u2018One last stop,\u2019 he replied.</p> <p>It was, of course, the Gas/Gro, where the same older woman, now reading the newspaper, was behind the counter, a cell phone pressed to her ear.</p><p>\u2018You need anything?\u2019 Eli asked, and I shook my head, sliding down in the seat a bit as he got out and went in. Just as he walked up to the door, a little blue Honda pulled in a few spaces down. I was in the midst of another yawn when I saw someone get out, shutting the driver\u2019s-side door and also leaving a passenger to wait. He was tall, wearing rumpled khakis, a plaid shirt, and black-framed glasses.</p><p>I leaned closer, taking in his profile as he went in. Then I turned slowly to look down at the Honda, where, sure enough, I saw my mother sitting in the passenger seat. She had her hair piled up on her head, her favorite black sweater tied over her shoulders, and she looked tired. Inside, her grad student was pouring himself a coffee. I watched him grab a pack of gum, and then an apple pie, as he headed up to the register, where Eli was chatting with the woman working as she rang him up. What do you know, I thought. My mother was dating a store-goer.</p><p>When Eli came out, a bottled water and bag of Doritos in hand, I watched her study him as he passed, eyes narrowed as she took in his too-long dark hair, the worn T-shirt, the way he jangled his keys in his hand. I knew she was cataloging him instantly: high school education, not college bound or even interested, working class. The same things, if I was honest, that I would have thought, once. But I was one night, and many hours, further away from my mother now. Even with this short distance between us.</p><p>She might have still been watching when Eli got in the truck, shutting the door behind him. I didn\u2019t know, because by then I\u2019d already turned to face him, my back to her, unrecognizable. Just any girl, nodding in reply as he asked if I was ready, finally, to go home.</p> <p>Chapter NINE</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s done!\u2019</p><p>I opened my eyes, blinked, then shut them again. Maybe I was dreaming. A moment later, though, I heard it again.</p><p>\u2018Done! Finished!\u2019 A door opened and shut, followed by footsteps, coming closer. \u2018Hello? Where is everybody?\u2019</p><p>I sat up, then glanced at my watch. It was four fifteen, and I\u2019d been up until six A.M. the morning before. Or that morning, actually. These days, it was kind of hard to draw a distinction.</p><p>I slid off my bed, then walked to my bedroom door, easing it open just in time to see my dad approaching Thisbe\u2019s room, one hand already outstretched to the knob. \u2018Hey,\u2019 he said to me, \u2018Guess what! I \u2013\u2019</p> <p>Lightning quick, I reached out, intercepting his fingers just as they made contact and pulling them back. \u2018Wait,\u2019 I whispered. \u2018Don\u2019t.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 he said.</p><p>I wrapped my hand around his, pulling him into my room and shutting the door gently behind us. Then I motioned for him to follow me across the short distance to the window, the farthest spot from the wall between the baby\u2019s room and mine.</p><p>\u2018Auden,\u2019 he said, his voice still loud. \u2018What are you doing?\u2019</p><p>\u2018The baby was really colicky last night,\u2019 I whispered. \u2018And this morning. But she\u2019s finally sleeping, so I bet Heidi is, too.\u2019</p><p>He glanced at his watch, then at my closed door. \u2018How do you know she\u2019s sleeping?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Who?\u2019</p><p>\u2018The baby. Or Heidi, for that matter,\u2019 he said.</p> <p>\u2018Do you hear crying?\u2019 I asked him.</p><p>We both listened. All that was audible was the noise machine. \u2018Well, this is anticlimactic,\u2019 he said after a moment. \u2018I finally finish my book and nobody cares.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You finished your book?\u2019 I asked. \u2018That\u2019s great.\u2019</p><p>Now, he smiled. \u2018Just wrote the last paragraph. Want to hear it?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Are you kidding?\u2019 I replied. \u2018Of course I do.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Come on, then.\u2019</p><p>He opened the door, and I followed him \u2013 quietly \u2013 down the hallway, back to his office, where he\u2019d pretty much been living for the last couple of weeks. This was obvious by the collection of mugs, empty water bottles, and broken apple cores in various states of decomposition that I spied as soon as I stepped inside.</p><p>\u2018Okay,\u2019 my dad said, sitting down in front of his laptop and punching a few keys. A document appeared, and he rubbed his hands together, then moved the page down so only a couple of lines were showing. \u2018Ready?\u2019</p><p>I nodded. \u2018Ready.\u2019</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u2018\u201cThe path was more narrow now, the lacy boughs of the trees bending to meet each other as I walked beneath them. Somewhere, ahead, was the sea.\u201d\u2019</p><p>When he finished, we just stood there, letting the words settle around us. It was a big moment, although I was somewhat distracted as distantly, I was pretty sure I heard a yelp. \u2018Wow,\u2019 I said, hoping I was wrong. \u2018That\u2019s great.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s been a long haul, that\u2019s for sure,\u2019 he said, leaning back in his chair, which creaked beneath him. \u2018Ten years, all leading up to those twenty-seven words. I can\u2019t really believe it\u2019s finally done.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Congratulations,\u2019 I said.</p><p>Thisbe was definitely crying now, the sound growing louder from down the hall. My dad sat up straighter, hearing it, then said, \u2018Sounds like they\u2019re up! Let\u2019s go share the good news, shall we?\u2019</p><p>And with that, he was out of his chair, a bounce in his step as he walked back down to Thisbe\u2019s room, pushing the door open. Instantly, the crying went from low level to full on. \u2018Honey, guess what?\u2019 he was saying as I caught up with him. \u2018I finished my book!\u2019</p><p>All it took was one look at Heidi to know that, frankly, she probably couldn\u2019t have cared less. She was still in her pajamas from the night before, a pair of yoga pants and a rumpled T-shirt with some kind of damp stain on the front. Her hair was flat and stringy, her eyes red as she looked at both of us, as if we looked familiar, but she wasn\u2019t quite sure why. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Oh, Robert,\u2019 she managed as Thisbe squirmed in her arms, her own face red and twisted, \u2018that\u2019s just wonderful.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I think a celebration is in order, don\u2019t you?\u2019 he asked, then turned to look at me for confirmation. I was still trying to decide whether I should nod or not when he added, \u2018I was thinking we\u2019d do a nice dinner. Just the two of us. What do you think?\u2019</p><p>It was hard to ignore Thisbe when she was screaming. I knew, because I had been trying since, oh, the day I\u2019d arrived. And yet my dad could somehow do it. Apparently.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 Heidi said slowly, looking down at the baby, who was clearly in a state. \u2018I don\u2019t think I can take her out like this...\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Of course not,\u2019 my dad said. \u2018We\u2019ll find a sitter. Didn\u2019t Isabel say she\u2019d love to come help you out one night?\u2019</p><p>Heidi blinked at him. She honestly looked like pictures of prisoners of war I\u2019d seen in history books, that out of it and shell-shocked. \u2018She did,\u2019 she said. \u2018But...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Let\u2019s call her, then,\u2019 my dad said. \u2018Get her earning those godmother stripes. I\u2019ll do it, if you like. What\u2019s her number?\u2019</p><p>\u2018She\u2019s out of town,\u2019 Heidi said.</p><p>\u2018Oh.\u2019 My dad considered this. And then, slowly, he turned to me. \u2018Well... Auden? Think you can help us out here?\u2019</p> <p>Heidi looked at me, then shook her head. \u2018Oh, no, that\u2019s not fair. We can\u2019t put you on the spot like that.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sure Auden doesn\u2019t mind,\u2019 my dad said. To me he added, \u2018Do you? It would only be for a couple of hours.\u2019</p><p>I probably should have been annoyed by this easy assumption, but honestly, looking at Heidi, agreeing felt more like an intervention than a favor. I said, \u2018Sure. No problem.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But you\u2019ve got to go to work,\u2019 Heidi said, shifting Thisbe to her other arm, which did not stop or even slow down the crying. \u2018The books... payroll is tomorrow.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well,\u2019 my dad said, glancing at me again. \u2018Maybe...\u2019</p><p>I was noticing that he did this a lot, the half-sentence-trailing-off thing, leaving you (or me, in this case) to finish his thought for him. \u2018I\u2019ll just take her with me,\u2019 I said to Heidi. \u2018Then you can pick her up when you\u2019re done.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 she said, jiggling Thisbe. \u2018She\u2019s not exactly in good shape for an outing.\u2019</p><p>\u2018The sea air will do her good!\u2019 my dad said, reaching over to take the baby from her. He smiled down at her screaming face, then sat down in the nearby rocking chair, cradling her in one arm. Heidi followed the baby\u2019s movement with her eyes, her expression unchanging. \u2018And you, too, honey. Go jump in the shower, and take your time. We\u2019ve got it from here.\u2019</p><p>Heidi glanced at me, and I nodded. A moment later, she started moving toward the door. Out in the hall, she looked back at my dad, who was still rocking Thisbe, seemingly unaffected by her continued fussing, as if she wasn\u2019t quite sure who he was. Truth be told, at that moment, I wasn\u2019t either.</p><p>With Heidi gone, I half expected my dad to hand the baby right over to me. But he didn\u2019t. He sat there, rocking her and patting her back with one hand. I wasn\u2019t even sure he was aware I was in the doorway, watching him, even as I lingered there, wondering if he\u2019d done this same thing with Hollis and me. If my mother was to be believed, probably not. I certainly wouldn\u2019t have thought so even ten minutes earlier. But maybe people can change, or at least try to. I was beginning to see evidence of it everywhere, even though I knew enough to not be convinced, just yet.</p><p>It had been about a week since my long night out, and since then, my knowledge of Colby nightlife only continued to expand. All those nights by myself, driving to the Wheelhouse, and then through the neighborhoods and streets, stopping now and then at the Gas/Gro: they\u2019d been as boring as treading water. It was only now, with Eli, that I was finding the real night.</p><p>It was at the Laundromat, sharing pie and coffee with Clyde as he detailed his latest culinary adventures. Dodging the crazies at Park Mart while on the hunt for dental floss, wind chimes, and whatever else was on the list Eli carried in his head. Going to the boardwalk after last call, when a guy named Mohammed set up a pizza cart outside the most popular clubs to sell the best slice of cheese \u2013 at a dollar fifty a pop \u2013 I\u2019d ever had in my life. Fishing on the pier and watching the phosphorescence lighting up the water below. I\u2019d leave Clementine\u2019s after closing, spend some time shooting the breeze with the girls, and then make my excuses and head off by myself. Fifteen minutes, half an hour, an hour later, at the Gas/Gro, or Beach Beans, I\u2019d cross paths with Eli, and the adventures would begin.</p><p>\u2018How does anyone get to the age of eighteen,\u2019 he\u2019d said to me the night before, \u2018without bowling?\u2019</p><p>We were at the Ten Pin, a bowling alley open late a couple of towns over from Colby. The lanes were narrow, the benches sticky, and I didn\u2019t even want to know what the story was with the shoes I\u2019d had to rent. But Eli had insisted we come, once he\u2019d heard that this was one of the many things my childhood had excluded.</p> <p>\u2018I told you,\u2019 I said as he sat down at the head of the lane, sliding our score sheet beneath a rusty clip, \u2018my parents were not sports oriented.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You bowl indoors, though,\u2019 he said. \u2018So you should be, like, a pro at this.\u2019</p><p>I made a face at him. \u2018You know, when I told you I\u2019d missed out on a lot of things, I didn\u2019t mean that I was necessarily sorry about all of them.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You would be very sorry if you never bowled,\u2019 he told me, holding out the ball he\u2019d picked out for me. \u2018Here.\u2019 I took the ball, putting my fingers in the holes the way he showed me. Then he gestured for me to follow him to the top of the lane. \u2018Now, when I was a kid,\u2019 he said, \u2018we learned by squatting down and just pushing the ball forward with both hands.\u2019</p><p>I looked down the lanes on either side of us, which were empty, as it was two A.M. The only people around were sitting up at the bar behind us, which was barely visible due to a fog of cigarette smoke. \u2018I\u2019m not squatting down,\u2019 I said firmly.</p><p>\u2018Fine. Then you have to learn the proper release.\u2019 He lifted his hands, holding an imaginary ball, then stepped forward, lowering it to his side, and then ahead of him, opening his fingers. \u2018Like that. Okay?\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Okay.\u2019</p><p>I lifted up the ball. He didn\u2019t move, still standing right beside me. I shot him a look and he shrugged, retreating back to the sticky bench.</p><p>Since our first night out together a week earlier, this was pretty much how it had been. A constant back-and-forth, sometimes serious, more often not, stretched out across the hours between when everyone else went home and the sun came up. I knew if I\u2019d spent the same amount of time with Eli during the day, or even early evening, I probably would have gotten to know him, too. But not like this. The night changed things, widening out the scope. What we said to each other, the things we did, they all took on a bigger meaning in the dark. Like time was sped up and slowed down, all at once.</p><p>So maybe that was why we always seemed to be talking about time as we wandered the aisles of stores under fluorescent lights, or drank coffee in a dark room while his clothes fluffed, or just drove through the mostly empty streets, en route to somewhere. Time ahead, like college, and behind, like childhood. But mostly, we discussed making up for lost time, if such a thing was possible. Eli seemed to think it was, at least in my case.</p> <p>\u2018You know what they say,\u2019 he\u2019d said to me a few nights earlier, as we helped ourselves to Slurpees at the Gas/Gro around three A.M. \u2018It\u2019s never too late to have a happy childhood.\u2019</p><p>I picked up a straw, poking down the pink slush in my cup. \u2018I wouldn\u2019t say my childhood was unhappy, though. It just wasn\u2019t...\u2019</p><p>Eli waited, fitting a lid onto his cup with a click.</p><p>\u2018... very childlike,\u2019 I finished. I took a sip of my Slurpee, then added a bit of blue flavor for variety, a trick he\u2019d taught me a few nights before. \u2018My brother had kind of worn my parents out on the whole kid thing. They didn\u2019t have the patience to do it again.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But you were a kid,\u2019 he pointed out.</p> <p>\u2018I was,\u2019 I agreed. \u2018But in their minds, that was something I could overcome, if I just tried hard enough.\u2019</p><p>He gave me one of the looks I\u2019d come to recognize, his expression a mix of befuddlement and respect. You kind of had to see it to understand. Then he said, \u2018In our house, it was the total opposite. Kid central, all the time.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Really.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yup. You know how there\u2019s one house in the neighborhood where everyone goes to ride bikes, or watch cartoons, or sleep over, or build a tree house?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah,\u2019 I said. Then I added, \u2018I mean, I\u2019ve heard of such things.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That was our place. Because there were four of us, we were always halfway to any game of kickball or dodgeball. Plus my mom was always around, so we had the best snacks. Her pizza wraps were legendary.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Wow,\u2019 I said, following him up to the register. The cashier, the older woman I\u2019d come to recognize, looked up from her magazine, smiling at him as she rung us up. \u2018Your mom sounds great.\u2019</p><p>\u2018She is.\u2019 He said this so simply, matter-of-factly, as he pushed a couple of bills across to the cashier. \u2018She\u2019s so good it\u2019s hard for her to convince anyone to move out. It took her forever to get rid of my sister and older brother. And Jake\u2019s the baby, and totally spoiled, so she\u2019s probably stuck with him until some girl is stupid enough to marry him.\u2019</p><p>Hearing this, I felt my face flush, remembering our fast, fumbled moment in the dunes. I swallowed, focusing on Wanda as I paid for my Slurpee.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until we were headed outside that he said suddenly, \u2018Look, no offense. I mean, about what I said. About Jake. I know you two \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not offended,\u2019 I said, cutting him off before he could begin to try and define this. \u2018Just humiliated.\u2019</p><p>\u2018We don\u2019t have to talk about it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Good.\u2019 I took a long draw off my straw. We walked in silence to the car, but then I said, \u2018In my defense, though, I don\u2019t have a lot of experience with, um, guys. So that was...\u2019</p><p>\u2018You don\u2019t have to explain,\u2019 he said, opening his door. \u2018Really. My brother is a piece of work. Let\u2019s just leave it at that.\u2019</p> <p>I smiled gratefully, as I slid into the front seat. \u2018I have one of those, too. A piece-of-work brother. Except he\u2019s in Europe, where he\u2019s been mooching off my parents for a couple of years now.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You can mooch from overseas?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hollis can,\u2019 I told him. \u2018He\u2019s got it down to an art form, practically.\u2019</p><p>Eli considered this as we stepped out into the hot, windy night. \u2018Seems kind of selfish,\u2019 he observed. \u2018Considering he got the only childhood.\u2019</p><p>I hadn\u2019t ever thought of it that way. \u2018Well, like you said. Maybe it\u2019s not too late. For my happy childhood, and all.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s not,\u2019 Eli said.</p><p>\u2018You sound awfully sure of that,\u2019 I told him. \u2018So sure I have to wonder if you\u2019ve done this kind of making-up thing before.\u2019</p><p>He shook his head, taking a sip off his straw. \u2018Nope. I have the opposite problem, actually.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Which is?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Too much of a childhood.\u2019 We walked over to the truck, and he pulled his door open. \u2018All I\u2019ve ever done was goof around. I even managed to make playing a living.\u2019</p><p>\u2018With the bike thing.\u2019</p><p>He nodded. \u2018And then you wake up one day, and you\u2019ve got nothing of value to show for all those years. Just a bunch of stupid stories, which seem even stupider the more time passes.\u2019</p><p>I looked at him over the top of the car. \u2018If you really feel that way,\u2019 I said, \u2018then why do you keep encouraging me to do all this stuff?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Because,\u2019 he said, \u2018you can always break curfew or have a slumber party. It\u2019s never too late. So you should, because...\u2019</p><p>He trailed off. By now, I knew not to fill in the gap.</p><p>\u2018... that\u2019s not the case with everything,\u2019 he said. \u2018Or so I\u2019m learning.\u2019</p><p>Now, ahead of me, the lights were blinking over the pins, on and off. The lane stretched out ahead, the wood polished and worn, and I tried to imagine how, as a kid, it would look even longer, almost endless.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re overthinking,\u2019 Eli called from behind me. \u2018Just throw it down there.\u2019</p><p>I stepped back, trying to remember his form, and swung the ball out in front of me. It took flight \u2013 which I was pretty sure was not supposed to happen \u2013 then landed with a loud thud. In the next lane. Before rolling, oh-so-slowly, into the gutter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Hey!\u2019 a voice bellowed from the smoking section. \u2018Careful there!\u2019</p><p>I felt my face flush, totally embarrassed, as the ball rolled to the end of the lane, disappearing behind the pins. A moment later, there was a thunk, and Eli appeared back beside me, holding it out to me.</p><p>\u2018I think I\u2019d better not,\u2019 I said. \u2018Clearly, this is not my strong suit.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It was your first shot,\u2019 he replied. \u2018What, you thought you\u2019d get a strike or something?\u2019</p> <p>I swallowed. In fact, this was exactly what I\u2019d thought. Or at least hoped for. \u2018I just...\u2019 I said. \u2018I\u2019m not good at this kind of thing.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Because you\u2019ve never done it.\u2019 He reached over, taking my hands, and put the ball in it. \u2018Try again. And this time, let go earlier.\u2019</p><p>He went back to the bench, and I forced myself to take a deep breath. It\u2019s just a game, I told myself. Not so important. Then, with this still in mind, I stepped forward and released the ball. It wasn\u2019t pretty \u2013 wobbling crookedly, and very slowly \u2013 but I took out two pins on the right. Which was...</p><p>\u2018Not bad,\u2019 Eli called out as the machine reset itself. \u2018Not bad at all.\u2019</p><p>We\u2019d played two full games, during which he bowled constant strikes and spares, and I focused on staying out of the gutter. Still, I managed a couple of good frames, which I surprised myself by actually being kind of happy about. So much so that as we left, I plucked the score sheet from the trash can where he\u2019d tossed it, folding it down to little square. When I looked up, I realized Eli was watching me.</p> <p>\u2018Documentation,\u2019 I explained. \u2018It\u2019s important.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Right,\u2019 he said, keeping his eyes on me as I slipped it into my pocket. \u2018Of course.\u2019</p><p>Outside, we walked across the rain-slicked parking lot to my car, leaving the blinking BOWL neon sign behind us. \u2018So now you\u2019ve done bowling, breaking curfew, almost getting your ass kicked at a party,\u2019 he said. \u2018What else is on the list?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 I said. \u2018What else did you do for your first eighteen years?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Like I said,\u2019 he said as I unlocked the car, \u2018I\u2019m not so sure that you should go by my example.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why not?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Because I have regrets,\u2019 he said. \u2018Also, I\u2019m a guy. And guys do different stuff.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Like ride bikes?\u2019 I said.</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 he replied. \u2018Like have food fights. And break stuff. And set off firecrackers on people\u2019s front porches. And...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Girls can\u2019t set off firecrackers on people\u2019s front porches?\u2019</p><p>\u2018They can,\u2019 he said as I cranked the engine. \u2018But they\u2019re smart enough not to. That\u2019s the difference.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 I said. \u2018I think food fights and breaking stuff are equal-opportunity activities.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Fine. But if you\u2019re going to do the firecracker thing, you\u2019re on your own. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What,\u2019 I said, \u2018you afraid or something?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Nope.\u2019 He sat back. \u2018Just been there, done that. Done the getting hauled down to the police station thing because of it, too. I appreciate your quest and everything, but I have to draw the line somewhere.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Wait,\u2019 I said, holding up my hand. \u2018My quest?\u2019</p><p>He turned to look at me. We were at a red light, no other cars anywhere in sight. \u2018Yeah,\u2019 he said. \u2018You know, like in Lord of the Rings, or Star Wars. You\u2019re searching for something you lost or need. It\u2019s a quest.\u2019</p><p>I just looked at him.</p><p>\u2018Maybe it\u2019s a guy thing,\u2019 he said. \u2018Fine, don\u2019t call it a quest. Call it chicken salad, I don\u2019t care. My point is, I\u2019m in, but within reason. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.\u2019</p><p>Here I\u2019d thought we were just hanging out. Killing time. But gender specific or not, I kind of liked the idea of searching for something you\u2019d lost or needed. Or both.</p><p>The light finally changed, dropping down to green, but I didn\u2019t hit the gas. Instead I said, \u2018Chicken salad?\u2019</p><p>\u2018What? You never said that as a kid?\u2019</p><p>\u2018\u201cCall it chicken salad\u201d?\u2019 I asked. He nodded. \u2018Um, no?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Wow.\u2019 He shook his head. \u2018What have you been doing all your life?\u2019</p><p>As soon as he said this, a million answers popped into my head, each of them true and legitimate. There were endless ways to spend your days, I knew that, none of them right or wrong. But given the chance for a real do-over, another way around, who would say no? Not me. Not then. Call it crazy, or just chicken salad. But within reason, or even without it, I was in, too.</p><p>\u2018Well,\u2019 Maggie said, \u2018that\u2019s an interesting outfit.\u2019</p><p>We all looked down at Thisbe, who was strapped in her stroller, still in the trance she\u2019d fallen into as soon as I wheeled her down the driveway, eyes wide open, fully silent. \u2018Interesting,\u2019 I repeated. \u2018What\u2019s your point?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Did Heidi put this on her?\u2019 Leah said, crouching down so she was at Thisbe\u2019s eye level.</p><p>\u2018No. I did.\u2019 Leah looked at Maggie, who raised her eyebrows. \u2018What? I think she looks cute.\u2019</p><p>\u2018She\u2019s wearing black,\u2019 Maggie said.</p><p>\u2018So?\u2019</p><p>\u2018So how often do you see infants in black?\u2019</p><p>I looked down at the baby again. When my dad went to go get ready for dinner, I\u2019d realized she, too, probably needed a change, so I went to her bureau to find a fresh Onesie. Since everything was pink, or had pink incorporated somewhere, I\u2019d decided to be contrary, digging in the very bottom drawer until I found a plain black Onesie and some bright green pants. I thought she looked kind of rock and roll, personally, but judging by the looks I was getting now \u2013 not to mention the odd expression Heidi had given me as we said good-bye \u2013 maybe I was wrong.</p><p>\u2018You know,\u2019 I said, \u2018just because you\u2019re a girl doesn\u2019t mean you have to wear pink.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Leah agreed, \u2018but you don\u2019t have to dress like a truck driver, either.\u2019</p><p>\u2018She doesn\u2019t look like a truck driver,\u2019 I said. \u2018God.\u2019</p><p>Leah cocked her head to the side. \u2018You\u2019re right. She looks like a farmer. Or maybe a construction worker.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Because she\u2019s not in pink?\u2019</p><p>\u2018She\u2019s a baby,\u2019 Maggie told me. \u2018Babies wear pastels.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Says who?\u2019 I asked. Esther opened her mouth to answer, but before she could I said, \u2018Society. The same society, I might add, that dictates that little girls should always be sugar and spice and everything nice, which encourages them to not be assertive. And that, in turn, then leads to low self-esteem, which can lead to eating disorders and increased tolerance and acceptance of domestic, sexual, and substance abuse.\u2019</p><p>They all looked at me. \u2018You get all that,\u2019 Leah said after a moment, \u2018from a pink Onesie?\u2019</p><p>Just then, Thisbe began to whimper, turning her head from side to side. \u2018Uh-oh,\u2019 I said, pushing the stroller forward, then back. \u2018This does not bode well.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Is she hungry or something?\u2019 Esther asked.</p> <p>\u2018Maybe it\u2019s her low self-esteem,\u2019 Leah said.</p><p>I ignored this as I bent down to unbuckle the baby, scooping her up into my arms. Her skin was warm, her cries just starting to get loud as I turned her around, locking my hands around her waist, and bent my knees. Up, down. Up, down. By the third round, she was quiet.</p><p>\u2018Wow,\u2019 Maggie said. \u2018You\u2019ve got the touch, huh?\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s called the elevator,\u2019 I told her. \u2018Works every time.\u2019</p><p>They all watched me for a moment. Then Esther said, \u2018You know, I think Auden\u2019s right. The black isn\u2019t so weird. It\u2019s kind of radical, actually.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Of course you\u2019d say that,\u2019 Leah said. \u2018Look what you\u2019re wearing.\u2019</p><p>Esther glanced down at her dark T-shirt. \u2018This isn\u2019t black. It\u2019s navy.\u2019</p><p>The other two girls snorted. Then Leah turned to me, saying, \u2018That\u2019s what she said all during her goth period, when she wouldn\u2019t wear anything but black. Black clothes, black shoes...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Black eyeliner, black lipstick,\u2019 Maggie added.</p><p>\u2018Are you guys ever going to let that go?\u2019 Esther asked. She sighed. \u2018It was a phase, all right? Like you two never did anything you regretted in high school.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Two words,\u2019 Maggie replied. \u2018Jake Stock.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018No kidding,\u2019 Leah agreed.</p><p>\u2018And you,\u2019 Esther said, pointing at her, \u2018dyed your hair blonde for Joe Parker. Which \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018No real redhead should ever do,\u2019 Leah finished. \u2018I\u2019m still ashamed.\u2019</p><p>Through all of this, I was still doing the elevator with Thisbe in my arms. She\u2019d gone back into her trance, quiet, and for a moment we all just watched her moving up and down. Finally Maggie said, \u2018Isn\u2019t it weird to think we were all that little, once?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Totally.\u2019 Leah reached out, taking Thisbe\u2019s hand and squeezing it. \u2018She\u2019s like a clean slate. No mistakes yet.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Lucky girl,\u2019 Esther said. Then, leaning closer, she added, \u2018A word of advice: don\u2019t do the goth thing. Nobody ever lets you forget it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And don\u2019t change for a guy, ever,\u2019 Leah added. \u2018If they\u2019re worthy, they\u2019ll like you just the way you are.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Always wear your helmet on the dirt jumps,\u2019 Maggie said.</p> <p>\u2018Don\u2019t eat beef jerky before you get on a roller coaster,\u2019 Leah said.</p><p>\u2018A nose piercing,\u2019 Esther chimed in, \u2018does not look good on everyone. Trust me.\u2019</p><p>Thisbe took all this in with her same, solemn expression. I shifted her in my arms, leaning down to breathe in her smell, a mix of milk and baby shampoo. \u2018Come on, Auden,\u2019 Leah said. \u2018You must have some wisdom to share.\u2019</p><p>I thought for a moment. \u2018Don\u2019t flirt with a girl\u2019s boyfriend in her own kitchen,\u2019 I said. \u2018Or answer the question \u201cWhat kind of a name is that?\u201d\u2019</p><p>\u2018And you know someone will ask her that,\u2019 Leah said. \u2018With a name like Thisbe, it\u2019s guaranteed.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What about this,\u2019 Maggie said. \u2018Stay clear of cute boys on bikes. They\u2019ll only break your heart.\u2019 I glanced over at her, and she smiled. \u2018Of course, that\u2019s easier said than done. Right?\u2019</p><p>I just looked at her, wondering what she meant. I hadn\u2019t told anyone about me and Eli, mostly because I knew they would just assume we were hooking up. What else would you be doing all night, every night, with someone else? The very fact that there were so many answers to that question made me want to leave this one, that Maggie was asking and yet not asking, unanswered.</p><p>\u2018God, Maggie,\u2019 Leah said, \u2018I thought you\u2019d let that Jake thing go, already.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I have,\u2019 Maggie told her.</p><p>\u2018Then why are you bugging Auden about it now?\u2019 Leah shook her head.</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s not what I was \u2013\u2019</p><p>This thought was interrupted, suddenly, by a crash from the front entrance. We all looked over just in time to see Adam bending back from the glass, rubbing his arm.</p><p>\u2018Pull open,\u2019 Maggie called out. As Leah rolled her eyes, she said, \u2018He never remembers. It\u2019s so weird.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Can\u2019t say I don\u2019t make an entrance,\u2019 Adam said, hardly bothered by what some would consider a public humiliation of sorts as he walked toward us, carrying a plastic grocery bag in one hand. \u2018So, ladies. An announcement.\u2019</p><p>Leah shot a wary look at the bag. \u2018Are you selling candy bars to raise money for math club again?\u2019</p><p>Adam just looked at her. \u2018That was eighth grade,\u2019 he said. \u2018And school\u2019s over, remember?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Ignore her,\u2019 Maggie told him as Leah shrugged, going back behind the counter. \u2018What\u2019s the announcement?\u2019</p><p>He grinned, reaching into the bag. \u2018Hot-dog party,\u2019 he said, pulling out a value pack of wieners. \u2018The first of the summer. After work, at me and Wallace\u2019s. Bring your own condiments.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Count me out,\u2019 Esther said, hopping up on the counter. \u2018I\u2019m a vegetarian.\u2019</p><p>Adam reached back into the bag, pulling out another pack of dogs. \u2018Bam!\u2019 he said, shaking it at her. \u2018Tofu Pups! Just for you!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Is the bathroom going to be clean?\u2019 Leah asked.</p><p>\u2018Isn\u2019t it always?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Leah, Maggie, and Esther said in unison.</p><p>\u2018Well, it will be tonight. I\u2019ll bust out my Clorox Clean-Up and everything.\u2019</p><p>Maggie smiled as he dropped the dogs back into the bag, twisting it shut. \u2018It\u2019s been a long time since the last hotdog party,\u2019 she said. \u2018What\u2019s the occasion?\u2019</p><p>\u2018The housewarming party we forgot to have two months ago when we moved in,\u2019 he said. \u2018Plus, it\u2019s been a while, you know? It just seemed like maybe it was time.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Is Eli coming?\u2019 Esther asked.</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s invited,\u2019 Adam said. \u2018So we\u2019ll see.\u2019</p><p>Maggie turned to me, saying, \u2018The hot-dog party was one of Abe\u2019s big traditions. He used to have them every Saturday at Eli\u2019s and his place. Hot dogs, baked beans...\u2019</p><p>\u2018... potato chips for the vegetable,\u2019 Leah said.</p> <p>\u2018And Popsicles for dessert. He called it the perfect summer meal.\u2019 Maggie reached up, twisting one of her curls around her finger. \u2018He and Eli always bought all the stuff in bulk at Park Mart, so they could have one at a moment\u2019s notice.\u2019</p><p>\u2018IHDP,\u2019 Esther said. When I raised my eyebrows, she added, \u2018Impromptu Hot-Dog Party.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Right,\u2019 I said. My knees were starting to hurt, so I stopped the elevator, shifting Thisbe across my right arm. Adam came closer, making a googly face at her.</p><p>\u2018You might be too young for an HDP,\u2019 he said, poking her tummy before turning toward the door. \u2018As for the rest of you, I expect to see you with condiments, at Wallace\u2019s, after closing. No excuses.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You know,\u2019 Leah said, \u2018I liked you better when you were selling candy bars.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018See you later!\u2019 he replied. This time, he got the door right, disappearing out onto the boardwalk as the chime sounded overhead.</p><p>Leah looked at Maggie. \u2018Great,\u2019 she muttered. \u2018He\u2019s got the hots for you, and now we all have to eat wieners because of it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018He does not have the hots for me,\u2019 Maggie said, walking over to the earring display and adjusting a couple of pairs.</p><p>\u2018Well, I\u2019m not going,\u2019 Leah said, pushing a button on the register. The drawer slid open, and she picked up some bills, straightening them. \u2018The summer is almost half over, and the only guys I\u2019ve hung out with are the ones I\u2019ve known since grade school. This is getting ridiculous.\u2019</p><p>\u2018There might be new boys at the hot-dog party,\u2019 Esther suggested.</p><p>\u2018Oh, please,\u2019 Leah said.</p> <p>\u2018Hey, they have tofu dogs. Anything is possible.\u2019</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t new boys I was interested in as I sat in the office for the next hour, my foot locked around the back wheels of Thisbe\u2019s stroller, pushing her back and forth as I paged through the day\u2019s receipts. It was just one boy, that same boy I always started to think about more and more as the hours passed.</p><p>Despite my best efforts, it was hard, as the hour got later, not to look ahead, wondering what the night might hold for me and Eli. This was something I\u2019d missed out on thus far, the sense of expectation when it came to someone else. So while a hot-dog party sounded fun and all \u2013 and might even have qualified for part of my quest, actually \u2013 if Eli wasn\u2019t going to be there, I was pretty sure I didn\u2019t want to be, either. Even if there were tofu dogs.</p><p>At around eight thirty, my dad and Heidi showed up to pick up the baby. Their arrival was heralded by a burst of squealing from the sales floor.</p><p>\u2018Oh, my God, you look so good!\u2019 Maggie said. \u2018You\u2019re super skinny already!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Please,\u2019 Heidi said. \u2018I could not wear a single thing in this store right now. Not even the ponchos.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Stop it,\u2019 Esther told her. \u2018You\u2019re gorgeous.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And so is Thisbe,\u2019 Leah added. \u2018We love her name, by the way.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018See?\u2019 I heard my dad say. \u2018I told you. It\u2019s a powerful name! It has presence.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Although,\u2019 Maggie said, \u2018the story of Thisbe is kind of tragic, really. Dying for her lover, and her soul blooming in the mulberry tree.\u2019</p><p>Even with the door shut between us, and no visual on this interaction, I could literally feel how impressed my dad was as he said, \u2018You know the story of Thisbe?\u2019</p><p>\u2018We read it in my classics class, when we were studying myth and women,\u2019 Maggie replied.</p><p>\u2018I thought it was from Shakespeare,\u2019 Heidi said.</p><p>\u2018It was reprised in Shakespeare, in a farcical way,\u2019 my dad told her. \u2018But this young lady is right. The true story is actually quite sad.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s our Maggie,\u2019 Leah said. \u2018Expert on all things tragic.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Is Auden in back?\u2019 I heard Heidi say. A moment later, she tapped on the door, sticking her head in. When she saw Thisbe, dozing in the stroller, she smiled. \u2018Look at that. And here I was worried she was screaming her head off the entire time.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Not the entire time,\u2019 I said. \u2018How was dinner?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Lovely,\u2019 she said. Then she yawned, putting her hand over her mouth. \u2018It was good that we went and celebrated. This is a great accomplishment for your father. He\u2019s worked so hard these last few weeks.\u2019</p><p>I looked down at Thisbe. \u2018So have you,\u2019 I said.</p><p>\u2018Oh, well.\u2019 She waved this off, then stepped forward, easing the stroller out the door. \u2018I can\u2019t thank you enough, Auden, really. I can\u2019t remember the last time we got out alone, together.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It was no problem,\u2019 I said.</p><p>\u2018Still. I appreciate it.\u2019 She glanced out at the sales floor. \u2018I\u2019d better get your father out of here while he\u2019s still cheerful. He claims this place gives him a headache. Too much pink. Can you even imagine?\u2019</p><p>I could. But I didn\u2019t say anything, instead just nodding as she wheeled Thisbe down the hallway, waving to me over her shoulder.</p><p>For the next two hours, I focused on my work, taking only passing notice of the customers that came and went (there was a run on flip-flops), the nine o\u2019clock dance (Elvis this time, from his rockabilly days), and the ongoing debate about attending the hot-dog party (Maggie was in, Leah out, Esther on the fence). At ten on the dot, I locked the safe, shut the door, and went out to join them as they headed out onto the boardwalk, still in discussion. All of this was part of my routine now, as was what came next: making my excuses, and going to find Eli.</p><p>\u2018We could just go for a little while,\u2019 Maggie was saying. \u2018To make an appearance.\u2019</p><p>Leah turned to me. \u2018What about you, Auden? Are you in or out?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh,\u2019 I said. \u2018Actually, I think I\u2019m going to just...\u2019</p><p>I was going to use one of my standards, like \u2018go home\u2019, or \u2018go run some errands\u2019, but just then, I looked over Maggie\u2019s shoulder to the bike shop, and there was Eli, sitting on the bench, the shop locked up and dark behind him. No searching for once, so simple. Or it would have been, except that he wasn\u2019t alone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Belissa Norwood was standing in front of him, her hair blowing around her face, hands in her pockets. She wasn\u2019t dressed up like she\u2019d been at the party, now wearing just jeans and a simple blue sleeveless shirt, a sweater tied around her waist, and I was struck, immediately, by how much prettier she looked. Less is more, indeed.</p><p>She was saying something to Eli, who wasn\u2019t looking at her, instead just leaning forward on the bench, his head propped in his hands. Then she said something else, and he looked up at her and nodded. I just stood there, staring, as she slid down to sit beside him, her knee resting against his. After a moment, she leaned her head on his shoulder, closing her eyes.</p><p>\u2018Auden?\u2019 Leah said. Seeing my face, she turned, looking behind her, just as a group of big-shouldered guys in tracksuits came out of the adjacent Jumbo Smoothie shop, blocking everything behind them. \u2018What is it?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nothing,\u2019 I said quickly. \u2018I\u2019m in.\u2019</p> <p>Wallace\u2019s apartment was the lower level of a green house two streets back from the beach. The yard was mostly dirt with a few clumps of grass; there was a washing machine on the side porch, and a sign hanging over the garage read, inexplicably, SENTIMENTAL JOURNEY.</p><p>\u2018Interesting name choice,\u2019 I said as I followed Maggie and Esther up the driveway, the bag of condiments we\u2019d bought at the Gas/Gro \u2013 ketchup, mustard, mayo, and chocolate sauce \u2013 in my hand. Leah was lagging behind, her phone to her ear, still networking in hopes of finding a better destination.</p><p>\u2018It wasn\u2019t up to the guys,\u2019 Maggie explained over her shoulder. \u2018The landlords picked it. It\u2019s a beach thing, you know, naming houses. The last place Wallace lived was called GULL\u2019S CRY.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Which was a terrible name,\u2019 Esther said. \u2018Hey, Mags, remember when Eli and Abe were living over in that dump on Fourth Street? What was that \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018SUMMER LOVIN\u2019,\u2019 Maggie finished for her as we climbed the front steps. \u2018And there was nothing to love about it, let me tell you. Such a dump.\u2019</p> <p>Just as she said this, Adam appeared in the open door, an oven mitt on one hand. \u2018Hey,\u2019 he said, holding it over his heart, offended. \u2018You haven\u2019t even come inside yet!\u2019</p><p>\u2018I wasn\u2019t talking about this place,\u2019 Maggie told him as he stepped aside, letting us in. \u2018This is... very nice.\u2019</p><p>Which was kind of an overstatement. The living room was small, crowded with worn, mismatched furniture: plaid couch, striped recliner, very beat-up coffee table, stained with rings upon rings upon rings. Clearly, though, someone had taken steps to spruce it up, as was evident by the bowl of nuts on the table and what looked like a brand-new scented candle burning on the bar that led to the kitchen.</p><p>\u2018Decor,\u2019 Adam said, having caught me noticing this. \u2018It really makes a difference, don\u2019t you think?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Still stinks like beer,\u2019 Leah informed him as she came in, dropping her phone in her purse.</p><p>\u2018Does that mean you don\u2019t want one?\u2019 Wallace yelled from the kitchen.</p> <p>\u2018No,\u2019 Leah said.</p><p>\u2018Didn\u2019t think so,\u2019 he replied, emerging with a twelve-pack of cans. He moved down the line, handing them off. I was going to pass but ended up taking one anyway, if only to be polite.</p><p>\u2018There are coasters to your left,\u2019 Adam said to Leah as she popped her can.</p><p>\u2018Coasters?\u2019 she said. \u2018On this coffee table? It\u2019s already covered with rings.\u2019</p><p>He glanced at it, then at her. \u2018Just because something\u2019s damaged doesn\u2019t mean it shouldn\u2019t be treated with respect.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Ad,\u2019 Wallace said, \u2018it\u2019s a coffee table, not an orphan.\u2019</p><p>Esther snickered. But Maggie, true to form, reached over and set a coaster on the table before putting her beer down. As she did, Adam reached behind him to the island, grabbing a camera sitting there. \u2018Our first hot-dog party,\u2019 he said, raising it to his eye. \u2018I have to get a shot of this.\u2019</p><p>The reaction in the room was swift, and unanimous: every single person except me raised their hands at once to cover their faces. The accompanying utterances, though, were varied. I heard everything from \u2018Please no\u2019 (Maggie), to \u2018Jesus Christ\u2019 (Wallace), to \u2018Stop it or die\u2019 (I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s obvious).</p> <p>Adam sighed, lowering the camera. \u2018Why,\u2019 he said, \u2018can you guys not allow one shot, once in a while?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Because that was the deal,\u2019 Wallace replied, his face muffled by his fingers, which were still over his mouth.</p><p>\u2018The deal?\u2019 I asked.</p><p>Maggie separated her thumb and forefinger, then said through them, \u2018Adam was yearbook editor for the last two years. He was relentless with the camera.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I only had one person on staff!\u2019 Adam protested. \u2018I had no choice. Somebody had to take pictures.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So we told him,\u2019 Wallace continued, around his palm, \u2018that we would tolerate it until the yearbook was done. But after that...\u2019</p><p>\u2018No more pictures,\u2019 Maggie said.</p><p>\u2018Ever,\u2019 Leah added.</p><p>Adam put the camera back on the island, a glum expression on his face. \u2018Fine,\u2019 he said, and everyone dropped their hands. \u2018But years from now, when you\u2019re feeling nostalgic about this summer and yet can\u2019t really reminisce because of a lack of documentation, don\u2019t blame me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018We\u2019ve been fully documented,\u2019 Maggie told him. \u2018The yearbook candids were of nothing but us.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Which is great, because you\u2019ll never forget anything,\u2019 he told her. \u2018But that\u2019s already history. This is now.\u2019</p><p>\u2018The now in which we are spared being photographed.\u2019 Leah picked up her beer \u2013 no coaster \u2013 and took a sip, then said, \u2018So who else is coming to this shindig?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You know, the usual suspects,\u2019 Wallace replied, sitting down in the armchair, which sagged noticeably beneath him. \u2018The guys from the shop, some of the locals from the bike park, that cute girl from Jumbo Smoothie, and \u2013\u2019</p><p>This thought was interrupted by the sound of someone banging up the steps. \u2018Yo!\u2019 a voice bellowed. \u2018You guys better have some beer, because I am ready to get \u2013\u2019</p><p>Jake Stock \u2013 in a form-fitting black tee and a deeper tan than ever \u2013 stopped talking and walking the minute he came through the door and saw me and Maggie, side by side on the couch. Talk about a buzz kill.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Get what?\u2019 Leah asked him, sipping her beer.</p><p>Jake looked at her, then at Wallace, who shrugged. \u2018Lovely to see you as always,\u2019 he said to Leah, then walked past her and us, heading to the kitchen. I glanced sideways at Maggie, but she was staring straight ahead at her beer on its coaster, her expression unreadable.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s not too late to hit the clubs,\u2019 Leah said to her. \u2018New boys, new chances.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Grill\u2019s on!\u2019 Adam hollered from the back door. \u2018Who wants the first dog?\u2019</p> <p>Maggie stood, picking up her beer. \u2018Me,\u2019 she called back, walking past Jake, who was leaning against the bar, sniffing the candle. \u2018I do.\u2019</p><p>An hour later, I\u2019d had one beer, two tofu dogs, and, despite my efforts to keep up with the party and conversation around me, entirely too much time to run over what I\u2019d seen on the boardwalk with Eli and Belissa. I looked at my watch: it was almost midnight. This time the night before, Eli and I had just been leaving Clyde\u2019s, where he\u2019d done a load of whites and we\u2019d shared a piece of butter-scotch almond tart. I looked down at the bowl of nuts, untouched on the table in front of me, and took another sip of my beer.</p><p>Really, it had been stupid to expect anything anyway. A few late nights does not a habit, or a relationship, make.</p><p>Just then, my phone rang, and I felt stupid by how quickly I jumped to answer it, thinking it might be Eli. Who, I realized a beat later, did not have my phone number. I flipped it open, only to see the number of another man who always seemed to keep me wondering: my brother.</p><p>\u2018Aud!\u2019 he said as soon as I answered. \u2018It\u2019s me! Guess where I am?\u2019</p> <p>As we\u2019d played this game before, and I\u2019d always lost, I just said, \u2018Tell me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Home!\u2019</p><p>At first, I thought he\u2019d said Rome. It wasn\u2019t until I asked him to repeat himself, and he did, that I realized he was two hundred miles away instead of however many thousand.</p><p>\u2018Home?\u2019 I said. \u2018Since when?\u2019</p><p>\u2018About two hours ago.\u2019 He laughed. \u2018I am jet-lagging like crazy, let me tell you. I have no freaking idea what time it is. Where are you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018At a party,\u2019 I said, standing up and walking to the front door, pushing it open.</p> <p>\u2018A party? Really?\u2019</p><p>He sounded so shocked I probably should have been offended. Then again, a few weeks earlier, I would have been surprised, too. \u2018Yeah,\u2019 I said, walking down to sit on the bottom step. \u2018So... what brings you back?\u2019</p><p>There was a pause. For dramatic purposes, as it turned out. \u2018Not what,\u2019 he said. \u2018Who.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Who?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Aud.\u2019 Another pause. Then, \u2018I\u2019m in love.\u2019</p><p>As he said this, I was looking up at a streetlight, bright and buzzing overhead. A few bugs were circling it, tiny specks up high. \u2018You are?\u2019 I said.</p><p>\u2018Yeah.\u2019 He laughed. \u2018It\u2019s crazy, I know. But I\u2019m sick with it. So sick I cut the trip short and jumped a plane to follow her back here.\u2019</p><p>The trip had been going on for a couple of years, which I wouldn\u2019t exactly have called short. But with Hollis, it was always about the bigger picture. \u2018So,\u2019 I said, \u2018who is she?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Her name,\u2019 he said, \u2018is Laura. She\u2019s amazing! I met her at a youth hostel in Seville. I was there for this big three-day festival-slash-rave...\u2019</p><p>I rolled my eyes at no one, there in the dark.</p><p>\u2018... and she was there for some genetic conference. She\u2019s a scientist, Aud! Doing grad work at the U, of all places. She was studying in the library where I was sleeping. Said my snoring was disturbing her research and I needed to get up and get out. Crazy, right? It\u2019s the story we\u2019ll tell our grandchildren!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hollis,\u2019 I said, \u2018you\u2019re messing with me right now, aren\u2019t you? You\u2019re in Paris, or somewhere, and just \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 he replied. \u2018No! God, no. This is the real deal. Here, I\u2019ll prove it.\u2019</p><p>There was a muffled noise, followed by some static. Then, I heard my mother recite, at a distance, in her most droll, flat tone, \u2018Yes. It is true. Your brother is in love and in my kitchen.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hear that?\u2019 Hollis asked, even as I sat there, startled at her voice. \u2018It\u2019s no joke!\u2019</p><p>\u2018So...\u2019 I said, still grappling, \u2018how long are you home for, then?\u2019</p><p>\u2018As long as Laura will have me. We\u2019re looking for an apartment, and I\u2019m going to sign up for fall classes. Might even hit up the English department, you never know.\u2019 He laughed. \u2018But seriously, before then I want to come down, visit you and Dad and Heidi and the munchkin, introduce my girl around. So let them know, okay?\u2019</p><p>\u2018All right,\u2019 I said slowly. \u2018I\u2019m glad you\u2019re back, Hollis.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Me, too. See you soon!\u2019</p><p>I hung up, then looked out at the quiet street, the ocean somewhere in the dark beyond. It was so early and yet, between what I\u2019d seen with Eli and my brother\u2019s strange homecoming, I felt, for the first time in a long while, like all I wanted to do was go crawl into bed. Pull the covers over my head, finding my own dark, and wake up when this night was over.</p><p>Thinking this, I went inside to say my good-byes, but the living room was empty, stereo still playing, beer cans scattered \u2013 mostly uncoastered \u2013 across the coffee table. I picked up my purse, then walked through the kitchen to the back door. Through it, I could see everyone gathered on the back deck: Adam at the grill with Maggie beside him, Leah and Esther sitting side by side on the rail. Wallace was opening a can of baked beans while Jake looked on from a nearby rusted lawn chair.</p><p>\u2018You knew he probably wouldn\u2019t show,\u2019 he was saying to Adam, who was busy turning dogs over the flame. \u2018He\u2019s been antisocial ever since it happened.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s been over a year now, though,\u2019 Adam said. \u2018He\u2019s got to start hanging out again sometime.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Maybe he is hanging out,\u2019 Maggie said. \u2018Just not with you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Meaning what?\u2019 Wallace asked. I stepped back behind the open door, waiting for Maggie to respond, but she didn\u2019t. \u2018Belissa? I can assure you, that is not happening.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No kidding. They\u2019ve been broken up for months, idiot,\u2019 Jake said.</p><p>\u2018Yeah, but she\u2019s still been hung up on him,\u2019 Wallace replied. \u2018But then tonight, she came by the shop to tell him she\u2019s got a new boyfriend. Some guy from the U, down for the summer working at the Cadillac tending bar. Said she wanted to tell him in person, so he didn\u2019t find out from someone else.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was a short silence. Then Leah said, \u2018And how do you know this, exactly?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I might have been just inside the door, checking the air on the display bikes.\u2019</p><p>Someone snorted. Adam said, \u2018You are the worst gossip, Wallace. Worse than a girl.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hey!\u2019 Esther said.</p> <p>\u2018Sorry. Just an expression,\u2019 Adam told her. \u2018Seriously, though, Maggie might be right. Maybe he does have something going on, somewhere else. When I invited him tonight, he said he\u2019d try to make it, but he already had plans with someone to run some errands.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Errands?\u2019 Leah said. \u2018Who runs errands at night?\u2019</p><p>\u2018It didn\u2019t make sense to me either,\u2019 Adam told her. \u2018But that\u2019s what he said.\u2019</p><p>I looked around the kitchen, then walked over to a nearby drawer, pulling it open, then the one beneath it. In the third, I found what I was looking for: the Colby phone book. It was such a small town, only one Laundromat was listed.</p><p>\u2018The Washroom, Clyde speaking.\u2019</p> <p>I glanced outside again, then stepped closer to the fridge. \u2018Hey, Clyde. It\u2019s Auden. Is Eli there?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You bet. Hang on.\u2019</p><p>There was a bit of interference, and a short exchange, as the receiver was handed over. Then Eli said, \u2018You are missing out on some serious apple crumble right now.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I got dragged to a hot-dog party,\u2019 I said.</p><p>A pause. \u2018Really.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah.\u2019 I turned around, shutting the phone book. \u2018Apparently, they are a very important rite of passage. So I figured I should check it out, for my quest and all.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Right,\u2019 he said.</p><p>For a moment, neither of us said anything, and I realized that it was the first time in a long while that I\u2019d felt nervous or uncomfortable around Eli. All those crazy nights, doing so many crazy things. And yet this, a simple phone conversation, was hard.</p><p>\u2018So let me guess,\u2019 he said. \u2018Right about now, Adam\u2019s probably still cooking hot dogs, even though no one wants any more.\u2019</p><p>I glanced outside. Sure enough, Adam was at the grill, opening up another pack. \u2018Um,\u2019 I said. \u2018Yeah, actually.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Leah and Esther are probably starting to argue about leaving.\u2019</p><p>Another look proved that yes, they did look like they were having a somewhat spirited conversation. Leah, at least, was gesturing pretty widely. \u2018They are. But how did you \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018And my brother,\u2019 he continued, \u2018having arrived talking big about throwing down and scoring with women, is most likely drunk and dozing off somewhere. Alone.\u2019</p><p>I peeked back at Jake. His eyes were definitely closed. \u2018You know,\u2019 I said, \u2018with all the time we spent together, you could have mentioned you were a psychic.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I\u2019m not,\u2019 he said. \u2018You need a ride?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I do,\u2019 I replied, without even hesitating.</p><p>\u2018Be there in ten.\u2019</p><p>Seventeen minutes later, and I was out on the deck with everyone else, watching Leah and Maggie argue.</p><p>\u2018The deal was,\u2019 Leah was saying, her voice slightly slurred, \u2018that I would come as long as we could leave at some point and do something else.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s past midnight!\u2019 Maggie replied. \u2018It\u2019s too late to go anywhere.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Which was exactly your plan. Get me here, get me drunk \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018You got yourself drunk,\u2019 Adam pointed out.</p><p>\u2018\u2013 and get me stuck. Same as always,\u2019 Leah finished. \u2018What happened to our big, fun summer before college? The one that was supposed to be full of new experiences and great memories we\u2019d take with us for when we were apart? It was supposed to be... to be...\u2019</p><p>She trailed off, clearly grasping for words. I said, \u2018The best of times.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s right!\u2019 She snapped her fingers. \u2018The best of times! What happened to the best of times?\u2019</p><p>Everyone fell completely silent, I assumed because they were all contemplating this question. Then I realized it was because Eli had appeared behind me in the open kitchen door.</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t ask me,\u2019 he said. We were all staring at him. \u2018I just came for the hot dogs.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hot dogs!\u2019 Adam burst out excitedly. \u2018We\u2019ve got hot dogs! Tons of hot dogs! Here! Have one!\u2019</p><p>He grabbed a bun, stuffing a dog into it, and thrust it out toward him. Eli raised his eyebrows, then took it. \u2018Thanks.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No problem!\u2019 Adam said. \u2018Lots more where that came from, too. Plus there\u2019s chips, and baked beans, and \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Adam,\u2019 Wallace said, his voice low. \u2018Chill out.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Right,\u2019 Adam replied just as loudly. Then, in a somewhat more subdued tone, he added, \u2018We have Popsicles, too.\u2019</p><p>Everyone looked at Eli again. It was so awkward and tense, you would have thought we were at a wake, not a cookout. Then again, maybe we kind of were.</p><p>\u2018So, Eli,\u2019 Maggie said after a moment, \u2018how\u2019s it going with the shop? Come up with a name yet?\u2019</p><p>Eli glanced at her, then down at his hot dog. \u2018It\u2019s still in the discussion phase.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Personally,\u2019 Adam said, \u2018I like The Chain Gang.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That makes us sound like a singing group,\u2019 Wallace told him.</p><p>\u2018A bad singing group,\u2019 Leah added.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s better than Pump Cycles.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s wrong with Pump Cycles?\u2019 Wallace asked. \u2018That\u2019s a great name.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It sounds menstrual,\u2019 Adam told him. Esther swatted at his arm. \u2018What? It does.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I think,\u2019 Jake said, surprising everyone, as we\u2019d assumed he was fast asleep, \u2018that we need a name with edge. Something dark, kind of dangerous.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Like?\u2019 Eli said.</p><p>\u2018Like,\u2019 Jake went on, eyes still closed, \u2018Barbed Wire Bikes. Or Flatline Bikes.\u2019</p><p>Adam rolled his eyes. \u2018You can\u2019t call a tourist bike shop Flatline Bikes.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why not?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Because people on vacation want to think about happy, relaxing things. When they rent a bike, they don\u2019t want to think about dying in some accident.\u2019</p><p>I could tell, by Adam\u2019s face as he said this \u2013 relaxed, opinionated \u2013 followed by just after \u2013 shocked, then ashamed \u2013 that he\u2019d had absolutely no idea what was going to come out of his mouth until it was too late. And now it was.</p><p>Another silence fell. Adam\u2019s face was flushed, and I watched Maggie and Esther exchange a desperate kind of look. Beside me, Eli just stood there, the awkwardness tangible, something solid you could feel. All I could think was that it was my fault he was there, that any and all of this was happening. But I had no idea what to do about it until I saw the pot of baked beans on the table next to me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was a split-second decision, the kind you hear about people making in the most dangerous or serious of situations. This was really neither, but I still was not thinking, just doing, as I reached my hand into the beans, scooping out a big gob with my fingers. Then, before I could reconsider, I turned and launched it right at Eli.</p><p>The beans hit him square in the forehead, then splattered back into his hair, a few falling to hit the deck at his feet. I could hear the inhaled breath of everyone else on the deck, indicating their absolute shock, watching this. But I kept my eyes on Eli, who blinked, then reached up, wiping some beans from the tip of his nose.</p><p>\u2018Oh, man,\u2019 he said to me. \u2018It\u2019s so on.\u2019</p><p>And just like that, he was reaching across me, lightning quick, and grabbing the pot of beans. One smooth movement \u2013 too fast to even think, much less stop him \u2013 and he\u2019d overturned it on my head. I felt heat on my hair, something slimy trickling down into my eyes, even as I grabbed for a discarded plate nearby, launching the half-eaten hot dog back at him.</p> <p>\u2018What the hell...\u2019 I heard Leah say, but the rest of the sentence was lost as Eli pelted me with buns from the bag he\u2019d grabbed off the kitchen counter. I ducked my head \u2013 still covered with beans \u2013 and ran across the deck, picking up along the way a bag of Cheetos for ammo.</p><p>\u2018Wait!\u2019 Adam yelled. \u2018That\u2019s my breakfast for the week!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, lighten up,\u2019 Maggie said, picking up a handful of coleslaw from her plate and tossing it at him. When Leah gasped, she threw another fistful at her.</p><p>Leah\u2019s jaw dropped. She looked down at her shirt, then up at Maggie. \u2018Oh, boy,\u2019 she said, picking up a beer can and shaking it, hard, before popping the top, \u2018you better run.\u2019</p><p>Maggie squealed, taking off down the stairs with Leah behind her, the beer already fizzing over. Meanwhile Adam and Wallace were now exchanging rapid fire with the leftover nuts while Esther, arms over her head, ducked behind Jake, who was asleep with a sprinkling of coleslaw over his face. All of this I noticed before running back into the house while trying to simultaneously dodge the Popsicle pieces Eli was tossing at me and chucking potato chips back at him behind me. I was so busy defending myself and keeping up my offensive that I didn\u2019t realize he had me trapped in the kitchen until it was too late.</p> <p>\u2018Wait,\u2019 I said, gasping for breath as I leaned against the fridge. I held up my hands. \u2018Time-out.\u2019</p><p>\u2018There\u2019s no time-outs in food fights,\u2019 Eli informed me, throwing another slushy piece at me. It hit my shoulder, knocking off some beans.</p><p>\u2018Then how do they end?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Whoever runs out of food first has to formally surrender,\u2019 he said.</p><p>I looked at my hands, covered with bean residue and pieces of chips, but basically empty. \u2018I\u2019m not good at surrendering.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No one is,\u2019 he said. \u2018But sometimes, you lose. Nothing you can do but admit it.\u2019</p> <p>We were both so filthy, standing there, beans in our hair, food all over our clothes. It was the last moment you\u2019d think would mean anything, and yet somehow, it did. Like only in all this chaos could it finally feel right to say the one thing I\u2019d wanted to, all along.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m really sorry about your friend,\u2019 I told him.</p><p>Eli nodded slowly. He kept his eyes right on me, not wavering a bit, as he said, \u2018Thanks.\u2019</p><p>Outside, I could hear someone still shrieking, other battles going on. But in the bright light of the kitchen, it was just us. The way it had been those other nights, yet suddenly something felt different. Not like we\u2019d changed so much as that we could. And might.</p><p>I was looking right at Eli, thinking this, and he was staring right back at me, and it was suddenly so easy to imagine myself reaching my hand forward to brush his hair from his face. It was all there: how his skin would feel against my fingertips, the strands against my palm, his hands rising up to my waist. Like it was already happening, and then, suddenly, I heard the door bang behind me.</p><p>\u2018Hey,\u2019 Adam called out, and I turned to see him holding up the camera again, the lens pointing right at us. \u2018Smile!\u2019</p><p>As the shutter snapped, I knew it was likely I\u2019d never see this picture. But even if I did, it wouldn\u2019t come close to capturing everything I was feeling right then. If I ever did get a copy, I already had the perfect place for it: a blue frame, a few words etched beneath. The best of times.</p><p>Chapter TEN</p> <p>\u2018Boot cut or boyfriend fit?\u2019</p><p>There was a pause. Then, \u2018Which do you think looks better?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You know, it\u2019s not an either/or kind of thing. It\u2019s more about how you want your butt to look.\u2019</p><p>I sighed, then put the deposit book into the safe and pushed the door shut with my foot. Another day, another opportunity to hear Maggie go on about the gospel of denim. I liked her and all \u2013 surprising as that was \u2013 but I still had trouble stomaching the seriously girly stuff. Like this.</p><p>\u2018See?\u2019 I heard her say a moment later as the customer emerged again from the fitting room. \u2018The boot gives you that nice flow from thigh to ankle. The upturn at the cuff draws your eye right to it, rather than other areas.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Other areas,\u2019 the woman grumbled, \u2018are my problem.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Mine, too.\u2019 Maggie sighed. \u2018But the boyfriend fit has its strengths also. So you should try them and we\u2019ll compare.\u2019</p><p>The woman said something, although I couldn\u2019t hear her over the front door chiming. A moment later, Esther came into the office. She had on army pants and a black tank top, and her expression was grave as she flopped into the chair behind me without comment.</p><p>\u2018Hey,\u2019 I said to her. \u2018Are you \u2013\u2019</p><p>Maggie suddenly appeared in the open door, eyes wide, her phone in one hand. She glanced at it, then at Esther. \u2018I just got your text! Is this for real? Hildy is... dead?\u2019</p><p>Esther nodded, still silent.</p><p>\u2018I can\u2019t believe it.\u2019 Maggie shook her head. \u2018But she was, like, one of us. I mean, after all this time...\u2019</p><p>I opened my mouth to say something, offer some kind of condolence. But before I could, Esther finally spoke. \u2018I know,\u2019 she said, her voice tight. \u2018She was a great car.\u2019</p><p>Outside, the fitting-room door swung open again. \u2018Car?\u2019 I asked.</p><p>They both looked at me. \u2018The best Jetta ever,\u2019 Maggie said. \u2018Hildy was our sole source of transportation in high school. She was one of the girls.\u2019</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Such a trooper,\u2019 Esther agreed. \u2018I bought her for three thousand bucks with eighty thousand miles on her, and she never let us down.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well,\u2019 Maggie said, \u2018I wouldn\u2019t say that. What about that time on the interstate, on the way to the World of Waffles?\u2019</p><p>Esther shot her a look. \u2018Are you really going to bring that up? Now? At this moment?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sorry,\u2019 Maggie said. Outside, the fitting room door swung open again. \u2018Oh, crap. Hold on.\u2019</p> <p>She disappeared back down the hallway. A moment later, I heard the customer say, \u2018I just don\u2019t know about these. Now I feel like my ankles are huge.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s just because you\u2019re used to the flare,\u2019 Maggie assured her. \u2018But look at how good your thighs look!\u2019</p><p>Esther tipped her head back, looking at the ceiling. I said, \u2018So what now? You\u2019re walking?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Not an option,\u2019 she said. \u2018I leave for school soon, and I have to take a car with me. I\u2019ve got some money saved, but not nearly enough.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You could take out a loan.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018And be in more debt?\u2019 She sighed. \u2018I\u2019m already going to be paying college off until I\u2019m dead.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 I heard the customer say outside. \u2018Neither have really looked right so far.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s because finding the perfect jeans is a process,\u2019 Maggie replied. \u2018I told you, you have to find the ones that speak to you.\u2019</p><p>I rolled my eyes again, picking up my pen and going back to my balance sheet. A moment later, I heard the customer go back into the fitting room, and Maggie reappeared in the office.</p><p>\u2018Okay, so let\u2019s talk options,\u2019 she said to Esther, who was still staring at the ceiling. \u2018What about a loan?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m already going to be paying off college until I\u2019m dead,\u2019 she repeated, her voice flat. \u2018I guess I\u2019ll just have to cash the savings bonds my grandparents gave me.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Oh, Esther! I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good idea.\u2019</p><p>I knew this really didn\u2019t concern me, but I felt bad for Esther. So I figured someone should jump in to clarify. \u2018She doesn\u2019t want to be in more debt,\u2019 I explained to Maggie, wishing there was a way to draw a parallel between this and jeans, somehow. \u2018If she takes out a loan, she\u2019ll owe more.\u2019</p><p>Outside, the fitting room door banged open again. \u2018I don\u2019t know about these...\u2019 I heard the customer say. \u2018Are my legs supposed to look like sausages?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Maggie called down to her, shaking her head. \u2018Try the other boot cuts, the ones with the embellished pockets, okay?\u2019</p><p>The door shut. Esther sighed. I said to Maggie, \u2018More money borrowed is more money owed. It\u2019s basic.\u2019</p><p>\u2018True,\u2019 Maggie agreed. \u2018But a car is a consumable item, not an asset. Esther\u2019s not investing the money she puts into it, because it will automatically begin to depreciate. So while it\u2019s tempting to liquidate her savings, and cash in the bonds, the better bet is probably to take advantage of the rate you can get from the local credit union on a loan.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You think?\u2019 Esther asked.</p><p>\u2018Absolutely. I mean,\u2019 she continued, \u2018what is the rate right now, like, 5.99 percent or something? So you do that, and keep your bonds in savings where they retain their full market value. It\u2019s a more cost-effective use of the money.\u2019</p> <p>I just looked at her. Who was this girl?</p><p>\u2018What about these?\u2019 the customer called out.</p><p>Maggie glanced down the hallway, her face breaking into a big smile. \u2018Oh, man,\u2019 she said, clapping her hands. \u2018What do you think?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I think,\u2019 the woman said, \u2018that they\u2019re speaking to me.\u2019</p><p>Maggie laughed, and as I watched her head back down to the fitting rooms, I sat there, trying to process what I\u2019d just seen. It wasn\u2019t easy. In fact, later that night, when she came in before locking up, I was still thinking about it.</p><p>\u2018That financial stuff,\u2019 I said to her as she slid the cash drawer onto the desk. \u2018How did you know all that?\u2019</p><p>She glanced up at me. \u2018Oh, mostly from my riding days. My mom wasn\u2019t exactly supportive of it as a hobby, so I had to finance my bikes and equipment and stuff.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s pretty impressive.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Maybe,\u2019 she said. \u2018Too bad it\u2019s not what impresses my mom.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No?\u2019 She shook her head. \u2018What does, then?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, I don\u2019t know,\u2019 she said. \u2018Maybe if I\u2019d agreed to do the debutante thing like she wanted. Or taken up pageants instead of riding jump bikes with a bunch of grungy boys. I\u2019d always tell her, why can\u2019t I do both? Who says you have to be either smart or pretty, or into girly stuff or sports? Life shouldn\u2019t be about the either/or. We\u2019re capable of more than that, you know?\u2019</p><p>Clearly, she was. Not that I\u2019d seen it, really, until now. \u2018Yeah,\u2019 I said. \u2018That does make sense.\u2019</p><p>She smiled, then grabbed her keys off the desk, sliding them into her pocket. \u2018I\u2019m going to go clean up the denim section while you finish up. Finding those slim boot cuts for that woman was work. But it was so worth it. Her butt looked great when she left here.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I bet,\u2019 I said, and then she was gone back down the hallway to fold. I sat there for a minute, in that pink and orange room, thinking about what impressed my mom, and the either/or I\u2019d been stuck in for so long. Maybe it was true, and being a girl could be about interest rates and skinny jeans, riding bikes and wearing pink. Not about any one thing, but everything.</p><p>Over the next couple of weeks, I fell into the perfect routine. Mornings were for sleep, evenings for work. My nights were for Eli.</p><p>These days, I didn\u2019t have to make it look like I was bumping into him accidentally. Instead, it was understood that we met each evening after I got off work at the Gas/ Gro, where we fueled up on both gas (coffee) and gro (you never knew what you might need) and planned our evening\u2019s activities. Which meant errands, eating pie with Clyde, and working on my quest, one item at a time.</p><p>\u2018Really?\u2019 I said, one night around one as we stood outside Tallyho, Leah\u2019s favorite club. There was a neon sign in the window that said HOLA MARGARITAS! and a beefy, bored-looking guy sitting on a stool by the door, checking messages on his phone. \u2018You think I need to do this?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yup,\u2019 Eli said. \u2018Hitting a club is a rite of passage. And you get extra points if it\u2019s a bad club.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018But I don\u2019t have an ID,\u2019 I told him as we walked closer, passing a girl in a red dress, puffy eyed and stumbling.</p><p>\u2018You don\u2019t need one.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Are you sure?\u2019</p><p>Instead of answering, he reached down and grabbed my hand, and I felt a jolt run through me. Since that night at the hot-dog party, we\u2019d been closer, but this was the first real physical contact between us. I was so busy worrying about what it might mean that it took me a minute to realize how natural and easy his palm felt against mine. Like it wasn\u2019t new at all, but something I\u2019d done recently and often, that familiar.</p> <p>\u2018Hey,\u2019 Eli said to the bouncer as we approached. \u2018What\u2019s the cover?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You got ID?\u2019</p><p>Eli pulled out his wallet, then handed over his license. The guy glanced at it, then at him, before giving it back. \u2018What about her?\u2019</p><p>\u2018She forgot hers,\u2019 Eli said. \u2018But don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll vouch for her.\u2019</p><p>The guy gave him a flat look. \u2018Honor system doesn\u2019t fly here, sorry.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I hear you,\u2019 Eli replied. \u2018But maybe you can make an exception.\u2019</p><p>I expected the guy to react in some way, but if anything he looked even more bored than before. \u2018No ID, no exceptions.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s fine,\u2019 I said to Eli. \u2018Really.\u2019</p><p>He held up his hand, quieting me. Then he said, \u2018Look. We don\u2019t want to drink. We don\u2019t even want to stay long. Five minutes, max.\u2019</p><p>The bouncer, now starting to look annoyed, said, \u2018What part of no ID, no entry, do you not understand?\u2019</p><p>\u2018What if I told you\u2019 \u2013 Eli pressed on as I squirmed, worrying my palm was now entirely sticky against his \u2013 \u2018that this was a quest?\u2019</p> <p>The guy just looked at him. Through the door, I could hear bass thumping, thumping. Finally he said, \u2018What kind of quest?\u2019</p><p>No way, I thought. There\u2019s just no way.</p><p>\u2018She\u2019s never done anything,\u2019 Eli told him, gesturing at me. \u2018No parties in high school, no prom, no homecoming. No social life, ever.\u2019 The bouncer looked at me, and I tried to look adequately culturally stunted. \u2018So we\u2019re just, you know, trying to make up for lost stuff, one thing at a time. This is on the list.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Tallyho is on the list?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Going to a club is,\u2019 Eli told him. \u2018Not drinking at a club. Not even staying at a club. Just going.\u2019</p><p>The bouncer looked at me again. He said, \u2018For five minutes.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Maybe even four,\u2019 Eli replied.</p><p>I just stood there, feeling my heart beat, and then the guy was reaching for my hand, pulling a rubber stamp out from his chest pocket. He pressed it against mine, then gestured for Eli\u2019s so he could do the same. \u2018Stay away from the bar,\u2019 he said. \u2018And you\u2019ve got five minutes.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Awesome,\u2019 Eli said, and with that, he was tugging me inside.</p><p>\u2018Wait,\u2019 I said as we headed down a dark, narrow hallway that led to a room full of flashing lights, \u2018how did you do that?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I told you,\u2019 he said over his shoulder. He had to yell over the music, which was just getting louder. \u2018Everyone understands a quest.\u2019</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure how to reply to this. Not that I could have anyway, as we emerged into the club, which was so loud I couldn\u2019t hear anything, even my own voice. It was a single room, square, lined with booths on three sides, a bar on the other. The dance floor was in the middle, and it was packed with people: girls in tight shirts, holding beer bottles, guys with deep tans and faux-surfer gear shuffling their feet alongside them.</p><p>\u2018This is crazy,\u2019 I yelled to Eli, who was still holding my hand. He either didn\u2019t hear or just didn\u2019t reply, though, pulling me alongside the dance floor.</p><p>I was trying to step over feet and purses, and barely succeeding, the floor thumping beneath me with every beat. The air felt thick and sticky, and smelled like perfume and smoke, and already I\u2019d broken a sweat, even though we\u2019d been in there for mere seconds. It was like being in a carnival fun house, but with a copious amount of hair gel.</p><p>\u2018Last dance!\u2019 I heard a voice yell from somewhere overhead, filtering through the pounding music. \u2018Grab someone and hit the floor, it\u2019s already tomorrow!\u2019</p><p>Suddenly, the song changed, in midbeat, to something slow with a more quiet, sensual beat. There was a bunch of hooting from somewhere on the floor, and the crowd there changed, with some people leaving, the remainders pairing up as new couples joined them. I was so immersed in watching this that when Eli suddenly hung a sharp left, pulling me into the crowd, I almost lost my footing and went down entirely.</p><p>\u2018Wait,\u2019 I said as we brushed past one couple in mid-grope, followed by a guy and a girl totally grinding on each other. She was still holding her beer, the bottle dangling from two fingers. \u2018I don\u2019t know if I \u2013\u2019</p><p>He stopped walking. I pulled up short beside him, my hand still in his, and realized we were in the center of the floor, a bunch of spinning lights over our heads. I looked up at them, then at everyone around us, before turning back to him.</p><p>\u2018Come on,\u2019 he said. Then he stepped forward, letting loose of my hand and sliding his arms down to my waist. \u2018We\u2019ve still got a good two minutes.\u2019</p><p>I smiled at him, in spite of myself, and felt my feet step forward, closer. It came so naturally to put my arms around his neck, my fingers finding each other there. And just like that, we were dancing.</p><p>\u2018This is insane,\u2019 I said, looking around me. \u2018It\u2019s...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Worth doing once,\u2019 he finished for me. \u2018But only once.\u2019</p><p>I smiled, and then, in the middle of Tallyho, in the middle of the night, in the middle of everything, Eli kissed me. It was not at all how I\u2019d imagined it happening, and yet totally perfect anyway.</p><p>When he pulled back moments later, the song was winding down. And yet everyone kept dancing, kept holding on, until the very end. I rested my head against Eli\u2019s chest, letting it last, knowing that what the DJ had said was true. It was already tomorrow. But I had a feeling it was going to be a really good day.</p><p>When I woke up at noon, the house was quiet. No waves, no crying. Nothing, except...</p><p>\u2018Are you kidding? Of course I\u2019ll come. I wouldn\u2019t miss it!\u2019</p><p>I blinked, rolling over, then got out of bed and made my way to the bathroom, where I woke up slowly while brushing my teeth. My dad\u2019s voice, louder now, kept drifting down the hallway. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018No, no, there\u2019s a couple of daily flights...\u2019 There was the sound of keys clacking. \u2018Sure. The timing couldn\u2019t be better. I\u2019ll bring the draft with me. Yes. Great! See you then.\u2019</p><p>By the time I came down for coffee ten minutes later, he was in the kitchen, pacing back and forth. Heidi was at the table, looking bleary, with Isby in her arms.</p><p>\u2018... a great opportunity to get my name back out there,\u2019 my dad was saying. \u2018Lots of industry types, just the people I need to make contact with. It\u2019s perfect.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s tonight?\u2019 Heidi asked. \u2018Isn\u2019t that kind of short notice?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Does it matter? I\u2019ll just book a flight, head up there for a night, and then come back.\u2019</p><p>I pulled a mug out of the cupboard, watching Heidi as she processed this information. It took a while, but then everything did on the mornings after Isby was up crying, as she had been most of the night before. Sleep deprivation dulled all Heidi\u2019s edges, but especially the cognitive ones.</p><p>\u2018When?\u2019 she said finally.</p><p>\u2018When what?\u2019</p><p>In her arms, Isby squawked, and she winced, putting her over her shoulder. \u2018When will you be back?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Sometime tomorrow. Maybe in the evening,\u2019 my dad replied. He was all jacked up, still moving around. \u2018As long as I\u2019m there, I might as well try to take some meetings. At least set up a lunch.\u2019</p><p>Heidi swallowed, then looked down at Isby, who was snuffling into her shoulder. \u2018I just,\u2019 she began, then stopped. \u2018I\u2019m not sure this is a good time for you to go away.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 my dad said. \u2018Why?\u2019</p><p>I took a sip from my mug, making a point of keeping my back to all of this.</p><p>\u2018Well,\u2019 Heidi said after a moment, \u2018it\u2019s just that the baby\u2019s been really fussy lately. I haven\u2019t slept in so long... I just don\u2019t know if I can...\u2019</p><p>My dad stopped walking. \u2018You want me to stay.\u2019</p> <p>It was not a question. Heidi said, \u2018Robert, I\u2019m just wondering if you could wait a couple more weeks. Until we\u2019re on more of a schedule.\u2019</p><p>\u2018This party is tonight,\u2019 he said slowly. \u2018That\u2019s the whole point.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know. But I just think \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Fine.\u2019</p><p>I grabbed the carafe, filling my cup again, even though I\u2019d barely taken two sips of what I had.</p><p>\u2018Robert \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018No. I\u2019ll just call Peter and tell him no, sorry, I can\u2019t make it. I\u2019m sure there will be another Writers\u2019 Guild benefit in a few weeks.\u2019</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to be part of this. Not ever, but especially not today, which I\u2019d started so happily on the floor of Tallyho, with Eli. So I made it a point not to look at Heidi or my dad as I slipped out of the kitchen and back upstairs to my room, where I pushed open my window and sat on the sill, letting the ocean drown out anything else I might have heard.</p> <p>Still, I was not surprised when I came down a couple of hours later to see a small carry-on suitcase by the door. My dad might have made an effort to sound like he would compromise. But again, he had gotten his way.</p><p>By the time I left for work, he was already gone, and Heidi was in the pink room, rocking Isby in her chair. I paused outside the door, thinking I should probably check in with her, but then I stopped myself. It wasn\u2019t like she\u2019d asked me for help. And I was tired of always offering it anyway.</p><p>At Clementine\u2019s, I busied myself in the office, trying to focus on Eli and the night ahead. Out on the floor, Maggie had a steady stream of customers, thanks to an outdoor concert that was going on at the boardwalk pavilion. Around nine thirty, she stuck her head in the office door.</p><p>\u2018Have you seen anything about a Barefoot special order?\u2019</p><p>I glanced up at her, my head still swimming with numbers. \u2018A what?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Barefoot flip-flops?\u2019 she said. \u2018There\u2019s someone here who said they set up a special order for, like, twenty pairs with Heidi ages ago. I can\u2019t find a record of it anywhere.\u2019</p><p>I shook my head. \u2018Did you call her?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I hate to bother her. The baby might be sleeping.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Unlikely,\u2019 I said. Then I handed her the phone, dialing it first.</p><p>She glanced back out at the floor, the receiver cocked between her ear and shoulder, as I turned back to the payroll. \u2018Heidi? Hi, it\u2019s Maggie. Look I just... are you okay?\u2019</p><p>I pulled the calculator closer, clearing the screen. Outside, I could hear some girls squealing over the clearance rack.</p><p>\u2018No, it\u2019s just, you sounded...\u2019 Maggie paused. \u2018What? Yeah, I can tell. She\u2019s really crying, huh? Look, I\u2019m so sorry I bothered you, but there\u2019s this special order thing...\u2019</p><p>Eli, I thought, punching in a number. Tonight. Hit the plus sign. Not my problem, subtotal, total. It took three different transactions, but finally, Maggie hung up.</p><p>\u2018She says they\u2019re in the storeroom, in one of the jeans boxes,\u2019 she reported, handing the phone back to me. \u2018At least, I think that\u2019s what she was saying. It was hard to tell with all the crying.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah,\u2019 I said, clearing the screen again. \u2018Isby can really let it rip.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Not her,\u2019 she replied. \u2018It was Heidi. She sounds miserable. Is she all right?\u2019</p><p>I turned, looking at her. \u2018Heidi was crying?\u2019</p><p>\u2018She acted like she wasn\u2019t. But you can tell, you know?\u2019 The door chimed again. \u2018Crap. I gotta get back out there. Can you go look for that box for me?\u2019</p><p>I nodded. Then I sat there for a second before pushing out my chair and heading into the storeroom, where I found the flip-flops right where Heidi said they\u2019d be. I picked up the box, carrying it out to the floor, where Maggie shot me a grateful look as I slid it onto the counter. Then I pushed out the front door and turned toward home.</p><p>I actually would have felt better if I\u2019d heard Isby\u2019s familiar wailing as I stepped into the foyer, but instead it was quiet. I went down the dark hallway to the kitchen, where a single light was on over the sink. The living room was dark, so dark that at first I didn\u2019t even see Heidi.</p><p>She was sitting on the couch, Isby in her arms, and she was crying. Not with gasps and shrieks, the kind I was used to, but a silent, constant weeping that gave me a chill up the back of my neck. It was such a raw, personal moment that I wanted to turn around and let her have it in peace. But I knew I couldn\u2019t.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Heidi?\u2019 I said. She didn\u2019t respond. I moved closer, squatting down beside her. When I reached out, touching her leg, she sobbed harder, tears dripping down onto my hand. I looked at Isby, who was awake and staring up at her. \u2018Give me the baby.\u2019</p><p>She shook her head. Still crying, her shoulders shaking.</p><p>\u2018Heidi. Please.\u2019 No response. She was scaring me, so I reached out, taking Isby from her arms. As soon as I did, she curled into herself, pulling her knees to her chest, and turned her face away from me.</p><p>I looked at her, then at Isby. I had no idea what to do. And while I knew I should probably call my dad, or even my mom, I instead walked to the kitchen and dialed the one number I thought might put me in contact with someone who could help.</p> <p>\u2018Gas/Gro, Wanda speaking.\u2019</p><p>In my mind, I could see the cashier that was always there at this time of night, with her dangling earrings and blonde hair. I cleared my throat.</p><p>\u2018Hi, Wanda.\u2019 I jiggled Isby, who was sputtering a bit. \u2018I, um... this is Auden, I come in there a lot around this time of night for coffee? I\u2019m trying to find Eli Stock? It\u2019s kind of an emergency, I mean, not really, but he\u2019s about twenty or so, dark hair, drives a black \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hello?\u2019</p><p>At the sound of Eli\u2019s voice, I felt some small part of me relax. \u2018Hi. It\u2019s me.\u2019 I paused, then clarified, \u2018Auden.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I had a feeling,\u2019 he replied. \u2018I am not sure who else would actually call me at the Gas/Gro.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah,\u2019 I said, glancing at Heidi, who was harder than ever to see now in the dark of the living room, curled into the couch. \u2018Sorry about that. I just kind of have a situation here, and I\u2019m not sure what to do.\u2019</p><p>\u2018A situation,\u2019 he repeated. \u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019</p><p>I stepped into the foyer, putting Isby over my shoulder, and told him. As I did, faintly, distantly, I could hear Heidi, still sobbing.</p><p>\u2018Sit tight,\u2019 he said when I was done. \u2018I know just what to do.\u2019</p><p>Twenty minutes later, there was a knock at the door. When I walked over and opened it, there was Eli, carrying four cups of GroRoast and a pack of cupcakes. \u2018Coffee?\u2019 I said. \u2018This is your solution?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018No,\u2019 he replied. \u2018This is.\u2019</p><p>And he stepped aside, revealing a small, middle-aged woman with short dark hair. She had familiar olive skin and green eyes, and was wearing a sensible cardigan and slacks, a purse strapped across her, and spotless white tennis shoes.</p><p>\u2018Mom, this is Auden. Auden, my mom. Karen Stock.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hi,\u2019 I said. \u2018Thank you for coming. I just... I don\u2019t know what to do.\u2019</p><p>She smiled at me, then leaned closer, looking down at Isby, who was now starting to fuss. \u2018How old\u2019s the baby?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Six weeks.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And where\u2019s Mom?\u2019</p><p>\u2018In the living room,\u2019 I said, stepping back from the door. \u2018She\u2019s just crying; she won\u2019t even talk to me.\u2019</p> <p>Mrs. Stock came inside. Then she looked at Eli and said, \u2018Take the baby upstairs and swaddle her. I\u2019ll be up shortly.\u2019</p><p>He nodded, and then looked at me.</p><p>\u2018Should I...\u2019 I asked. \u2018I mean \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018She\u2019ll be just fine,\u2019 she said. \u2018Just trust me.\u2019</p><p>And the weird thing was, I did. Even as I stood there, watching this stranger walk past me into the living room. She put her purse down on the kitchen table, then moved over to Heidi, sitting down beside her. When she began to speak, I couldn\u2019t make out a word she was saying. But Heidi was listening. It was clear in the way that, after a moment, she let Mrs. Stock pull her into her arms, patting her on the back as she allowed herself to be the one soothed, finally.</p><p>By the time we got to the pink room, Isby was all-out fussing, working up to one of her fits. Eli stepped inside, flicking on the light, then said, \u2018Got a blanket?\u2019</p><p>\u2018A blanket?\u2019 He nodded. \u2018In the dresser. Third drawer, maybe?\u2019</p><p>I watched, jiggling Isby a bit as he walked over, rummaging around for a minute before pulling out a pink one with brown dots. He glanced at it, then shut the drawer. \u2018We need a bed,\u2019 he said. \u2018Something flat. Where\u2019s your room?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Next door,\u2019 I said. \u2018But I don\u2019t \u2013\u2019</p><p>He was already walking next door, leaving me no choice but to follow. Once there, he spread the blanket out on the bed sideways, then folded down the top corner. \u2018Okay,\u2019 he said, holding out his hands. \u2018Give her here.\u2019</p><p>I shot him a doubtful look. \u2018What are you doing?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Didn\u2019t you hear my mom?\u2019 he asked. \u2018You\u2019re supposed to trust me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018She said to trust her,\u2019 I pointed out.</p><p>\u2018You don\u2019t trust me?\u2019</p><p>I looked at him, then at the blanket, then at Isby, who was all-out squawking, and had a flash of him leading me to the center of the floor at Tallyho, not even a full day ago. I handed her over.</p><p>Isby was wailing, her face getting redder and redder as he carefully laid her down, her head just on the edge of the folded blanket. Then, as she writhed around, he put her left arm to her side and pulled the bottom tip of the blanket up and across her, then tucked the bottom corner over her shoulder. With each step, Isby wailed louder.</p><p>\u2018Eli,\u2019 I said, raising my voice to be heard. \u2018You\u2019re making it worse.\u2019</p><p>He didn\u2019t hear me, moving to the last corner, which he pulled tight across her waist and around her. Isby was allout screaming now.</p><p>\u2018Eli,\u2019 I said again, practically yelling, as he pulled the last corner tight and started to tuck it into one of the other folds, \u2018stop it. She\u2019s not \u2013\u2019</p><p>And then, suddenly, it was silent. It happened so abruptly and completely that for a moment I was sure Isby had died. But when I looked at her, and she was just lying there, all wrapped up like a tiny burrito, blinking at us.</p><p>\u2018\u2013 crying,\u2019 I finished. Eli reached down, picking her up, and handed her back to me. \u2018How did you do that?\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s not me,\u2019 he said as I eased myself carefully onto the bed. Isby opened her mouth, but only yawned, then settled against me. \u2018It\u2019s the swaddle. It\u2019s like magic. My mom swears by it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s amazing,\u2019 I said. \u2018How does she know all this?\u2019</p><p>\u2018She was a maternity ward nurse,\u2019 he replied. \u2018Just retired last year. Plus my brother and sister have four kids between them. Add in all of us, and she\u2019s had a lot of practice.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Always and Forever, Lara Jean (To All the Boys I've Loved Before #3)</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018It\u2019s fine,\u2019 I said, as always wanting to avoid a big emotional moment. \u2018I\u2019m just glad you feel better.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I do,\u2019 she said, looking down at Isby again. \u2018I really do.\u2019</p><p>Since then, she had seemed to be in better spirits, and Isby was sleeping a bit more, which was good for everyone. Still, Mrs. Stock had dropped by a couple more times, although I always seemed to miss her. When she\u2019d visited, though, I could always tell. Heidi just seemed happier.</p><p>Unlike my mother, who was still going on about Laura and how she was sucking out my brother\u2019s joie de vivre, one myelinated cell at a time. \u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 I said to her now. \u2018He seems to really like her.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Your brother likes everyone!</p><p>That\u2019s always been his fatal flaw.\u2019 Another dark sigh. \u2018You\u2019ll see when you meet her, Auden. She\u2019s just...\u2019</p><p>I glanced back out my window, just in time to see a silver Honda pulling into the driveway. \u2018Here,\u2019 I finished for her. \u2018I better go.\u2019</p><p>\u2018God help you,\u2019 she muttered. \u2018Call me later.\u2019</p><p>I told her I would, then closed my phone and walked out into the hallway just as my dad was yelling up to Heidi that Hollis had arrived.</p> <p>\u2018Ready to go meet your brother?\u2019 she said to Thisbe, bending down to unbuckle her from her seat. Together, we walked to the top of the stairs just as my dad opened the front door.</p><p>I could see Hollis getting out of the car, and even though it had been more than two years that he\u2019d been gone, he looked pretty much the same. A little skinnier, his hair somewhat shaggier. When Laura stepped out of the passenger side, she, too, looked awfully familiar, although at first I couldn\u2019t figure out why. Then Heidi gasped.</p><p>\u2018Oh, my God,\u2019 she said. \u2018Laura looks just like your mother!\u2019</p><p>She was right. Same long dark hair, same dark clothes, same pale, pale skin. Laura was a little shorter and curvier, but still, the resemblance was striking. The closer they got, the more it freaked me out.</p><p>\u2018There he is!\u2019 my dad said, pulling Hollis in for a hug as he stepped over the threshold. \u2018The world traveler returns!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Look at you, proud papa!</p> <p>Where\u2019s that baby girl?\u2019 Hollis said, grinning.</p><p>\u2018Right here,\u2019 Heidi said, starting down the stairs. I made myself follow her, even as Laura came in the door, taking off her sunglasses and folding them. Her eyes were dark, too. \u2018This is Thisbe.\u2019</p><p>Hollis immediately reached for the baby, lifting her up high over his head. She looked down at him, as if trying to make up her mind whether to start crying or not. \u2018Oh, boy,\u2019 he said. \u2018You\u2019re gonna be trouble. I can just tell!\u2019</p><p>My dad and Heidi laughed, but I kept my eyes on Laura, who was standing just off to the side, still holding her sunglasses, watching this scene with a somewhat clinical expression. After a moment of Hollis making googly faces at the baby, she very quietly \u2013 but pointedly \u2013 cleared her throat.</p><p>\u2018Oh, babe, sorry!\u2019 Hollis handed Thisbe off to my dad, then reached an arm over Laura\u2019s shoulders, pulling her in closer to everyone else. \u2018Everyone, this is my fianc\u00e9e, Laura.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Fianc\u00e9e?\u2019 my dad said. \u2018You didn\u2019t mention that in your phone call. When did you...\u2019</p><p>Laura smiled, showing no teeth. \u2018We didn\u2019t,\u2019 she said. \u2018Hollis is just...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Confident,\u2019 my brother finished for her. \u2018And ready. Even if she isn\u2019t.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I keep telling Hollis that marriage is serious,\u2019 Laura said. Her voice was very even and clear, like she was used to having the room\u2019s attention. \u2018You can\u2019t just jump into it like an airplane.\u2019</p><p>Dad and Heidi and I just stood there, not sure what to make of this, but Hollis just laughed. \u2018That\u2019s my girl! She\u2019ll break my impulsive streak yet.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, don\u2019t do that,\u2019 my dad said to Laura, clapping Hollis on the shoulder again. \u2018We love that about this guy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Impulsiveness can be charming,\u2019 she agreed. \u2018But deliberation can have an appeal, as well.\u2019</p><p>My dad raised his eyebrows. \u2018Actually,\u2019 he said, his tone a bit sharper than before, \u2018I \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018You must be exhausted from your trip!\u2019 Heidi said, reaching to take Thisbe from my father. \u2018Let\u2019s go and have a cold drink. We\u2019ve got lemonade, beer, wine...\u2019</p><p>She turned, starting for the kitchen, and Hollis and my dad immediately fell in behind her, leaving me with Laura. I watched as she examined her sunglasses, then took a corner of her black shirt, slowly rubbing a spot on one lens clean before again folding them shut. Then she looked up at me, as if surprised to find me still standing there.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s really nice to meet you,\u2019 I said, for lack of anything better. \u2018Hollis seems... he\u2019s very happy.\u2019</p><p>She nodded. \u2018He\u2019s a very happy person,\u2019 she said, although from her tone, I couldn\u2019t tell if she thought this was an asset or not.</p><p>\u2018Babe!\u2019 my brother yelled. \u2018Get in here! You gotta see this view!\u2019</p><p>Laura gave me another tight smile, then walked into the living room. I waited a beat or two, then followed her, stopping in the kitchen, where my dad and Heidi were huddled together by the sink, pouring lemonade into glasses.</p><p>\u2018... her first time meeting us,\u2019 Heidi was saying. \u2018She\u2019s probably just nervous.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nervous? You call that nervous?\u2019 my dad replied.</p><p>Heidi said something else, but I didn\u2019t hear her, having turned my attention to my brother and Laura. They were standing in front of the open glass doors, the ocean a wide, clear blue in front of them. Hollis had his arm around her shoulders, gesturing with one hand as he said something about the horizon, but even from the back I could tell Laura was not particularly impressed. It was something about the posture, the way her head was slightly tilted to the side. Sure, she was a stranger. But I\u2019d seen it before.</p><p>\u2018So you don\u2019t like her.\u2019</p><p>I looked over at Eli. \u2018I didn\u2019t say that.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You didn\u2019t have to.\u2019</p><p>He pulled a container of milk off the shelf, sticking it in the cart. It was one thirty A.M., and we were at Park Mart, doing a little shopping. As it was a Monday night, we had the place pretty much to ourselves, and the quiet was just what I\u2019d needed, having earlier endured a two-hour family dinner that had basically devolved into an argument between my dad and Laura about capital punishment. This followed their spirited discussion about university funding (liberal arts versus sciences) over cocktails, which had come after a protracted debate about environmental policy during lunch. For me, it was like watching an adaptation of the last couple of years of my parents\u2019 marriage, just with someone else playing the role of My Mom. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018It\u2019s just,\u2019 I said to Eli, pushing the cart forward to follow him out of the grocery section and into sporting goods, \u2018she\u2019s really different from all the other girls Hollis has dated.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And what were they like?\u2019</p><p>A blur of gorgeous, friendly faces appeared in my mind. \u2018Nice,\u2019 I finally said. \u2018Sweet. More like Hollis.\u2019</p><p>Eli stopped to check out a camping stove, then moved on. \u2018He didn\u2019t want to marry any of the others, though. Right?\u2019</p> <p>I considered this as we passed a collection of catcher\u2019s mitts. \u2018Not for more than a few minutes.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But this girl he says is the one.\u2019 We were coming up on the bike section now, several lined up in a row, from kids\u2019 sizes to adult. He pulled a midsize bike off the rack, bouncing it on its front tire. \u2018So it seems to me, it doesn\u2019t matter what you or your mom or dad think. Relationships don\u2019t always make sense. Especially from the outside.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But this is Hollis,\u2019 I pointed out. \u2018He\u2019s never been serious about anything.\u2019</p><p>He climbed onto the bike, then rose up on the pedals, moving slowly forward. \u2018Well,\u2019 he said, \u2018maybe he just found the right person. People change.\u2019</p><p>He was riding around me and the cart, and as I watched him I thought of my mother, saying these same two words with a don\u2019t between them, with equal conviction. \u2018You know,\u2019 I said finally, \u2018everyone thinks you never ride anymore.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I don\u2019t.\u2019</p><p>I rolled my eyes, since he was passing me again as he said this. \u2018Then how come I\u2019m watching you do it right now?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 he said. \u2018What do you think?\u2019</p><p>The truth was, I wasn\u2019t sure. But I wanted to keep believing people could change, and it was certainly easier to do so when you were in the midst of it. The way I imagined I was as I stood there, aware of a slight breeze each time he passed, like a wave, the feeling of motion.</p><p>I\u2019d been at Clementine\u2019s for over an hour, catching up on paperwork, when I got the distinct feeling someone was watching me. And that someone was Maggie.</p><p>\u2018Hi,\u2019 she said when I looked up to find her standing in the half-open doorway. She had on a white eyelet sundress and orange flip-flops, her hair pulled back at her neck, and was holding a pricing gun. \u2018Got a minute?\u2019</p> <p>I nodded, and she glanced back out at the store before taking a step inside, then clearing a stack of catalogs off a nearby chair and sitting down.</p><p>She didn\u2019t say anything, and neither did I. All I could hear was a pop song, playing from the sales floor. Something about roller coasters and sweet tangy kisses.</p><p>\u2018So, look,\u2019 she began. \u2018About you and Eli.\u2019</p><p>This wasn\u2019t a question. Or even a statement. It was a fragment, and this was my justification for not responding. How can there even be a whole answer to a part of something?</p><p>\u2018I know you guys have been hanging out all night, like, every night,\u2019 she continued. \u2018And it\u2019s not exactly my business, but...\u2019</p><p>\u2018How?\u2019 I said.</p><p>She blinked at me. \u2018How is it not my business?\u2019</p><p>\u2018How do you know?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I just do.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What, you\u2019re all-knowing and all-seeing now?\u2019 I asked. \u2018Who are you, Big Brother?\u2019</p><p>\u2018This is a small town, Auden. In many ways, minuscule. Word gets around.\u2019 She sighed, looking down at the gun. \u2018Look, the thing is, I\u2019ve known Eli a long time. I don\u2019t want to see him get hurt.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019d honestly had no idea what she was getting at. None. But when I heard this, I felt like a fool for not having seen it coming. \u2018You think I\u2019m going to hurt Eli?\u2019</p><p>She shrugged. \u2018I don\u2019t know. After what happened with Jake...\u2019</p><p>\u2018That was totally different,\u2019 I said.</p><p>\u2018See, but I don\u2019t know that.\u2019 She sat back, folding her legs. \u2018All I have to go on is what I\u2019ve seen. And while the thing with Jake pissed me off because I was jealous, it was also somewhat karmic. He had it coming. Eli doesn\u2019t.\u2019</p><p>\u2018We\u2019re just...\u2019 I trailed off, not sure how much I wanted to explain this. \u2018We\u2019re friends.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Maybe so.\u2019 She looked down at the gun again, turning it in her lap. \u2018But we both know you\u2019re the reason he showed up at the party the other night. I heard you call him.\u2019</p><p>I raised my eyebrows. \u2018You are like Big Brother.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I was in the bathroom. The walls are so thin there! I sometimes can\u2019t even pee if anyone\u2019s in the kitchen.\u2019 She waved her hand. \u2018Anyway, then there\u2019s the bike thing, and the fact that you threw beans at him and he didn\u2019t completely go ballistic \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018It was just a food fight.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You don\u2019t understand, though,\u2019 she said. \u2018Eli hasn\u2019t done anything since Abe died. No parties, no hanging out, hardly even any conversation. Definitely no food fights. He\u2019s been under this cloud. And then suddenly you show up, and all that changes. Which is great.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But,\u2019 I said, because there is always a but.</p><p>\u2018But,\u2019 she continued, \u2018if you are just jerking his chain and playing around, he might not just bounce back like Jake did. There\u2019s more at stake here, and I just wasn\u2019t sure you knew that. So I wanted to tell you. Because that\u2019s what friends do.\u2019</p><p>I considered this as the music outside changed to something slower, more dreamy-sounding. \u2018Well,\u2019 I said, \u2018I guess he\u2019s lucky he has you. As a friend, I mean.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I wasn\u2019t talking about Eli.\u2019</p><p>I looked up at her. \u2018What?\u2019</p><p>\u2018We\u2019re friends,\u2019 she said, moving her hand back and forth between us. \u2018And friends are honest with each other. Even if the truth hurts. Right?\u2019</p><p>I would have agreed with this, but my own truth was that I really didn\u2019t know. All of this was new to me. So instead, I said, \u2018You don\u2019t have to worry. Nobody\u2019s getting hurt. We\u2019re just... we\u2019re hanging out. Nothing more.\u2019</p><p>She nodded slowly. \u2018Okay, then. That\u2019s all I need to know.\u2019</p><p>There was a beep from the sales floor, signaling a customer entering. Maggie got to her feet, then stuck her head out the door. \u2018Hi,\u2019 she called out. \u2018I\u2019ll be right with you!\u2019</p><p>\u2018No worries,\u2019 a voice I recognized replied. \u2018Just tell Auden to get her butt out here!\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Maggie turned to look at me. \u2018My brother,\u2019 I explained, pushing my chair back.</p><p>\u2018You have a brother?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Come and see for yourself.\u2019</p><p>When we got out to the floor, Hollis was standing by a box of half-off swimsuits, examining a purple thong bikini.</p> <p>\u2018Not your size,\u2019 I said as I approached. \u2018Or color, either.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Too bad,\u2019 he replied. \u2018I think it would look boss on me, don\u2019t you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I think you should stick to trunks,\u2019 I told him.</p><p>\u2018Actually,\u2019 Maggie piped up, \u2018in Europe, men often wear a more bikini style. Every summer we have at least one group of German tourists who show up in them.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No way,\u2019 Hollis told her. \u2018Over there, you just go to the nude beach. No suit needed, period!\u2019</p> <p>\u2018This is Maggie,\u2019 I said to him. \u2018Maggie, my brother, Hollis.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You went to a nude beach?\u2019 she asked him. \u2018Seriously?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sure, why not? You know what they say. When in Rome. Or Spain...\u2019 He tossed the thong back into the box. \u2018So, Aud, you up for a little very late lunch or super early dinner? Dad says there\u2019s a place with great onion rings I should try.\u2019</p><p>\u2018The Last Chance,\u2019 Maggie told him. \u2018End of the boardwalk, on the left. I recommend the tuna melt.\u2019</p><p>Hollis sighed. \u2018I love a tuna melt. That, you can\u2019t get in Spain. Even if you are naked.\u2019</p><p>I glanced back at the office. \u2018I actually have a lot of work to do...\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Oh, come on! You haven\u2019t seen me in two years.\u2019 Hollis shook his head at Maggie. \u2018My sister. She got all the drive in this family, obviously.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Go,\u2019 Maggie said to me. \u2018You can just stay later tonight, or something.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Listen to Maggie,\u2019 Hollis said. He said her name casually, like they\u2019d known each other for years. \u2018Come on. Let\u2019s go bond.\u2019</p><p>Out on the boardwalk, it was that golden time of the afternoon, past the heat of the day but before it began to cool off for evening. Hollis and I fell in behind a group of women with strollers, their wheels clacking across the boards beneath us.</p><p>\u2018So, where\u2019s Laura?\u2019 I asked him. \u2018She doesn\u2019t like onion rings?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Loves them,\u2019 he replied, sliding on his sunglasses. \u2018But she has work to do. She\u2019s applying for some grant for the spring and has some essays to write for it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Wow,\u2019 I said. \u2018She sounds like the driven one.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No kidding. She\u2019s unstoppable.\u2019</p> <p>He tipped his head back, looking up as a row of pelicans flew overhead, toward the water, and I watched with him for a moment. Then I said, \u2018She seems really nice, Hollis.\u2019</p><p>\u2018She is.\u2019 He smiled at me. \u2018She\u2019s not like any of the other girls I\u2019ve dated, huh?\u2019</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure how to answer this. But he was asking, so I said, \u2018Not really, no.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You should have heard Mom,\u2019 he said, laughing. \u2018For years she\u2019s on me for only dating vapid, mindless drones \u2013 her words, of course \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Of course.\u2019</p><p>\u2018\u2013 and now I show up with someone smart and amazing, and she totally freaks out. You should have seen her at dinner when Laura was talking about her work. So jealous she was almost sputtering.\u2019</p><p>Wow, I thought. Out loud I said, \u2018Jealous? You think?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, come on, Aud. You know Mom\u2019s used to being the smartest woman in the room. It\u2019s her thing.\u2019 He reached up, adjusting his sunglasses. \u2018She kept pulling me aside, telling me I was making a mistake, that I was too serious about Laura too quickly. Like I\u2019m going to take relationship advice from her, with that grad student lurking outside, sleeping in his car like some kind of stalker.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 I said.</p><p>He glanced at me. \u2018Oh, you know. She was sleeping with some grad student, he got serious about her and actually wanted something from her, so she cut him loose, and now he\u2019s hanging around, licking his wounds.\u2019</p><p>I had a flash of the guy in the dark-framed glasses, sitting out by the pool with his book. I didn\u2019t even know his name.</p><p>\u2018I felt so bad for the guy,\u2019 Hollis was saying now. \u2018Although God knows he should have seen it coming. It\u2019s not like she hasn\u2019t done it before.\u2019</p><p>It took me a minute to absorb all this, so I focused on the bike shop, which was coming up ahead. I could see Wallace and Adam on the bench outside, sharing a bag of potato chips. \u2018You think she does that a lot?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, God, yes. Since the divorce, anyway.\u2019 He slid his hands in his pockets, then glanced at me. \u2018I mean, you knew that, right? You had to.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sure,\u2019 I said quickly. \u2018Absolutely.\u2019</p><p>He watched my face for a moment. Then he said, \u2018Not that I can say anything, though. Considering I used to be just like her.\u2019</p><p>Again, I was speechless. What do you do when you finally hear everything you\u2019ve always thought said aloud? This time, though, I was saved from having to reply, as Adam spotted us. \u2018Hey, Auden! Come settle an argument!\u2019</p><p>Hollis glanced over at him and Wallace. \u2018Friends of yours?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah,\u2019 I said as Adam waved us over. Hollis looked surprised, which I tried not to take personally. \u2018Come on.\u2019</p><p>When we got over to them, I introduced my brother as Adam hopped off the bench, landing in front of us. \u2018Okay,\u2019 he said, holding up his hands. \u2018We\u2019re finally on the brink of a new name for the shop.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Which is to say,\u2019 Wallace piped in from behind him, his mouth full of chips, \u2018that we\u2019ve narrowed the list of possibilities to ten.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Ten?\u2019 I said.</p><p>\u2018But only five are any good,\u2019 Adam added. \u2018So we\u2019re taking an informal poll to see who likes which ones.\u2019</p><p>Hollis, always game, looked up at the bare awning. \u2018What\u2019s it called now?\u2019</p><p>\u2018The Bike Shop,\u2019 Wallace told him. Hollis raised his eyebrows. \u2018It\u2019s temporary.\u2019</p><p>\u2018For the last three years,\u2019 Adam said. \u2018So, okay. The list in no particular order, is as follows: Overdrive Bikes, the Chain Gang, Colby Cycles...\u2019</p><p>I was distracted temporarily as Eli came out of the shop, pushing a small pink bike with training wheels. He had a helmet in his free hand, and a couple with a little girl in tow were right behind him.</p><p>\u2018... the Crankshaft and Pedal to the Metal Bikes,\u2019 Adam finished. \u2018What do you think?\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hollis thought for a second. \u2018The Chain Gang or the Crankshaft,\u2019 he said. \u2018Overdrive is boring, Colby Cycles too corporate...\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s what I said!\u2019 Wallace said, pointing at him.</p><p>\u2018And Pedal to the Metal... I don\u2019t even know what to say about that.\u2019</p><p>Adam sighed. \u2018Everyone hates it. The only reason it\u2019s still on the list is that it\u2019s my favorite. Auden, what do you think?\u2019</p> <p>I was still watching Eli, though, as he bent over the pink bike, adjusting one of the pedals. The little girl for whom it was clearly intended, a redhead wearing blue shorts and a T-shirt with a giraffe on it, stood holding her mom\u2019s hand, looking apprehensive.</p><p>\u2018Like I said,\u2019 he was saying, \u2018this is a really good starter bike.\u2019</p><p>\u2018She wants to learn,\u2019 her mom was saying, running a hand over her daughter\u2019s head. \u2018But she\u2019s kind of nervous.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nothing to be nervous about.\u2019 Eli stood up, then looked at the girl. \u2018The training wheels will keep you up until you get the hang of it. And then one day, you just won\u2019t need them anymore.\u2019</p><p>\u2018How long does it usually take, though?\u2019 the father, who had on a baseball cap and leather sandals, asked. \u2018What\u2019s the norm?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Different for everyone,\u2019 Eli told him. \u2018When she\u2019s ready, she\u2019ll know.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What do you say, honey?\u2019 the woman asked. \u2018Want to try it out?\u2019</p><p>The girl nodded slowly, then stepped forward. I watched as Eli held out his hand, helping her onto the bike, then strapped the helmet on her head. She reached for the handlebars, carefully stretching her fingers over them.</p><p>\u2018All right, sweetie,\u2019 her dad said. \u2018Just pedal, like you do on your trike.\u2019</p><p>The girl put her feet down, tentatively pushing on the pedals, and moved about a half an inch forward. She glanced back at her parents, who smiled at her, then tried again. After another incremental budge, I watched as Eli put his hand on the back of the bike, nudging it forward just slightly. She was still pedaling and didn\u2019t even notice. But when she really began to move, she looked back at him, grinning.</p><p>\u2018Auden?\u2019</p> <p>I turned my head to see Adam looking at me, his face expectant. \u2018Um,\u2019 I said, \u2018I don\u2019t really like any of them that much. To be honest.\u2019</p><p>His face fell. \u2018Not even the Crankshaft?\u2019</p><p>I shook my head. \u2018Not really.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I told you they all sucked,\u2019 Wallace said.</p><p>\u2018He liked two of them!\u2019 Adam shot back.</p><p>\u2018Not that much,\u2019 Hollis said.</p><p>Adam sighed, flopping back down on the bench, and I waved good-bye as Hollis and I started walking again toward the Last Chance. After a few steps, though, I looked back at that little girl again. After that initial push, she\u2019d gotten going for real, and now had passed two storefronts and was almost at Clementine\u2019s. Her mom was trailing behind her, close but not too close, as she slowly made her way, all on her own.</p><p>The Last Chance was empty for once, and we got a booth right by the window without having to wait. As Hollis perused the menu, I looked out on to the boardwalk, watching the people walk by.</p> <p>\u2018So, Aud,\u2019 he said after a moment. \u2018I gotta say, I\u2019m really happy you did this.\u2019</p><p>I looked over at him. \u2018Did what?\u2019</p><p>\u2018This,\u2019 he said, gesturing around the restaurant. \u2018Coming here for the summer, hanging out, making friends. I was worried you\u2019d spend this summer like all the others.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Like all the others,\u2019 I repeated.</p><p>\u2018You know.\u2019 He picked up his water, taking a sip. \u2018Hanging out at the house with Mom, refilling wineglasses at her little superior get-togethers, studying for classes that haven\u2019t even started yet.\u2019</p><p>I felt myself stiffen. \u2018I never refilled wineglasses.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You get the idea.\u2019 He smiled at me, clearly unaware that he might have offended me. Or at least hurt my feelings. \u2018My point is, you\u2019re different here.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hollis, I\u2019ve only been here for a month.\u2019</p><p>\u2018A lot can happen in a month,\u2019 he replied. \u2018Shoot, in two weeks I met my future wife, changed my entire life\u2019s trajectory, and bought my first tie.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You bought a tie?\u2019 I asked. Because honestly, this was almost the most shocking part.</p><p>\u2018Yup.\u2019 He laughed. \u2018Seriously, though. Seeing you here, with your friends... it just really makes me happy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hollis,\u2019 I said. Now I was uncomfortable again, but for different reasons. My family was a lot of things \u2013 and changing daily, or so it seemed \u2013 but sentimental was not one of them. \u2018Come on.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m serious!\u2019 He looked down at his menu again, then up at me. \u2018Look, Aud. I know the divorce was hard for you. And living with Mom afterward had to be even harder. She\u2019s not exactly kid-friendly.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I wasn\u2019t a kid,\u2019 I told him. \u2018I was sixteen.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re always a kid around your parents,\u2019 he replied. \u2018Unless they\u2019re acting like children. Then you don\u2019t get the chance. You know what I\u2019m saying?\u2019</p><p>I realized, suddenly, that I did. Just about the same time that it hit me why my brother had stayed gone for so long, careful to keep an ocean and a telephone line between us and him. It was the reverse of most families: to be a kid, you had to leave home. It was returning that made you grow up, once and for all.</p><p>Just as I thought this, Adam and Wallace whizzed by on a pair of bikes, zigzagging through the pedestrians. Hollis said, \u2018Speaking of which, it\u2019s not too late.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Too late for what?\u2019</p><p>\u2018To learn to ride a bike.\u2019 He nodded back at the shop. \u2018I bet your friends could teach you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I can ride a bike,\u2019 I said.</p><p>\u2018Yeah? When did you learn?\u2019</p><p>I just looked at him. \u2018When I was six,\u2019 I said. \u2018In the driveway.\u2019</p><p>He thought for a moment. \u2018You sure about that?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Of course I am.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Because all I remember,\u2019 he said, \u2018is you getting a bike, falling off it right away, and then it sitting in the garage and slowly rusting until Dad gave it away.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That,\u2019 I said, \u2018is not what happened. I rode all over the driveway.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Did you?\u2019 He squinted, thinking hard. \u2018Well, you\u2019re probably right. God knows I\u2019ve killed a few brain cells in the last few years.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This was the truth: between the two of us, there was no question whose memory was more reliable. And wouldn\u2019t I know my own history better than anyone else? Still, even as we ordered, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about what he\u2019d said. He was going on about Laura, and Europe, but I was only half listening as I thought back, back, to that day in the driveway. It was all so clear: climbing on, pushing down on the pedals, rolling forward, it had to be true. Didn\u2019t it?</p><p>Chapter TWELVE</p><p>\u2018So the word on the street,\u2019 my mother said in her formal, cool way, \u2018is that you\u2019ve changed.\u2019</p><p>I took my toothbrush out of my mouth, already wary. \u2018Changed?\u2019</p> <p>These days, she always called around five, when I was waking up and she was ending her workday. I wanted to believe it was because she missed me, or had realized how important our connection really was to her. But I knew that really, she just needed someone to vent to about Hollis, who was back under her roof, still madly in love with Laura, and completely on her nerves.</p><p>\u2018For the better, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking,\u2019 she said now, although her tone suggested she was not entirely convinced. \u2018I believe the exact word your brother used was blossomed.\u2019</p><p>I looked at myself in the mirror: my hair was uncombed, I had toothpaste on my lips and was still wearing the scoop-necked tee I\u2019d had on last night at the bowling alley, which reeked of smoke. Not exactly flowery. \u2018Well,\u2019 I said, \u2018that\u2019s nice, I guess.\u2019</p><p>\u2018He was particularly impressed,\u2019 she said, \u2018with your newfound social life. Apparently you\u2019ve got scads of friends and a serious boyfriend as well?\u2019</p><p>The fact that this last part was phrased as a question pretty much said everything about how she felt about it personally. \u2018I don\u2019t have a boyfriend,\u2019 I told her.</p> <p>\u2018Just a boy you spend your nights with.\u2019 A statement, this time.</p><p>I looked at myself in the mirror again. \u2018Yep,\u2019 I told her. \u2018That\u2019s about right.\u2019</p><p>Among all the other sudden changes in my brother, he was now an early riser \u2013 Hollis, who\u2019d always slept past noon \u2013 as well as a jogger. He and Laura ran every day at sunrise, then came home to do yoga stretches and meditate. Although apparently, he wasn\u2019t that immersed in his oms and namastes. When he heard me come in the morning after their arrival, he immediately came to investigate.</p><p>\u2018Auden Penelope West,\u2019 he said, wagging a finger at me as I carefully shut the door behind me. \u2018Look at you, doing the walk of shame!\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not ashamed,\u2019 I replied, although I did kind of wish he\u2019d keep it down.</p><p>\u2018And who is this young man dropping you off?\u2019 he asked, pulling aside a blind to peer out at Eli, who was backing his truck out of the driveway. \u2018Shouldn\u2019t he have to show himself, get my approval before taking you out courting?\u2019</p> <p>I just looked at him. From the living room, I could hear Laura chanting.</p><p>\u2018My little sister,\u2019 he said, shaking his head. \u2018Staying out all night with a boy. Seems like just yesterday you were playing Barbies and skipping rope.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hollis, please,\u2019 I said. \u2018Mom considered Barbies weapons of chauvinism, and nobody\u2019s skipped rope since 1950.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I just can\u2019t believe,\u2019 he said, ignoring this, \u2018you\u2019re growing up so fast. Next you\u2019ll be married and bouncing a baby on your knee.\u2019</p><p>I ignored this, walking past him to the stairs, but it didn\u2019t stop him, not then, and not the mornings that followed, when he always managed to be waiting for me, opening the door as I came up the front walk. One day he was actually sitting on the porch when we pulled up, necessitating both an introduction and a conversation with Eli.</p><p>\u2018Nice guy,\u2019 he\u2019d said, when I\u2019d finally wrangled him away. \u2018What\u2019s with the scars on his arm, though?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Car accident,\u2019 I told him.</p><p>\u2018Really? What happened?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I don\u2019t really know, actually.\u2019</p><p>He shot me a doubtful look as he pulled the front door open for me. \u2018Seems kind of weird, considering how much time you two spend together.\u2019</p><p>I shrugged. \u2018Not really. It just hasn\u2019t come up.\u2019</p><p>I could tell he didn\u2019t believe me, not that I cared. I\u2019d long ago stopped trying to explain my relationship with Eli to anyone, including myself. It wasn\u2019t any one thing, but many strung together: long nights, trips to Park Mart and Builder\u2019s Supply, pie with Clyde, bowling in the early morning, and my quest. We didn\u2019t talk about our scars, the ones you could see, and the ones you couldn\u2019t. Instead, I was having all the fun and frivolousness I was due in one summer, night by night.</p><p>Now, my mother took another sip of her wine as I left the bathroom, heading back down the hall. Thisbe\u2019s door was slightly ajar, and I could hear her waves, steady and crashing, over and over again.</p><p>\u2018Well,\u2019 she said, \u2018frankly, I\u2019m glad to hear you\u2019re not getting involved with someone. The last thing you need before you head off to Defriese is some boy begging you to stay with him. A smart woman knows a fling is always best.\u2019</p><p>There had been a time when I liked my mother to think we were similar. Even craved it. But hearing this, I felt a weird twinge, something not settling right. What I was doing with Eli wasn\u2019t like her and her graduate student(s).</p><p>\u2018So,\u2019 I said, shaking this off, \u2018how\u2019s Hollis doing?\u2019</p><p>She sighed, loud and long. \u2018He\u2019s insane. Completely insane. I came home yesterday and do you know what he was doing?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Wearing a tie.\u2019 She gave this a minute to sink in, then added, \u2018She had him interviewing for a job at a bank. Your brother! Who this time last year was living in a tent on the side of a mountain in Germany!\u2019</p><p>It was just too easy to get my mom off my back these days. One mention of Hollis, and she was off and running. \u2018A bank,\u2019 I said. \u2018What\u2019s he going to be, a teller or something?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, I don\u2019t know,\u2019 she said irritably. \u2018I didn\u2019t even ask, I was so horrified. He did volunteer, however, that Laura thinks employment might help him to be \u201cmore responsible\u201d and \u201cprepared for their future together\u201d. Like that\u2019s a good thing. I don\u2019t even think this is a relationship, it\u2019s so dysfunctional. I don\u2019t know what to call it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Call it chicken salad.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Too late, I realized this had slipped out, without me even realizing it. \u2018Nothing,\u2019 I told her.</p><p>I heard footsteps, and looked down the hall just in time to see Heidi and my dad coming upstairs. From the looks of it they, too, were having a pretty intense conversation: my dad was throwing his arms around, his annoyed face on, while she just shook her head. I eased my door shut, switching my phone to my other ear.</p><p>\u2018... ridiculous,\u2019 my mom was saying now. \u2018Two years of culture and travel, and for what? To sit and process deposits all day long? It\u2019s heartbreaking.\u2019</p><p>She really sounded sad. Still, I couldn\u2019t help but say, \u2018Mom, most people Hollis\u2019s age have jobs, you know. Especially if they aren\u2019t in school.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I didn\u2019t raise either of you to be like most people,\u2019 she replied. \u2018Don\u2019t you know that by now?\u2019</p><p>I had a flash of myself the night before, standing at the Park Mart with Eli, in the toy section. He\u2019d stopped by a big display of rubber sport balls, pulling one out and bouncing it on the floor. \u2018Oh, yeah,\u2019 he said. \u2018Hear that?\u2019</p><p>\u2018The bouncing noise?\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s more,\u2019 he told me, \u2018than a bouncing noise. That is the noise of imminent pain.\u2019</p><p>I looked at the ball, still moving up and down under his open palm. \u2018Pain?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018In dodgeball,\u2019 he explained. \u2018Or kickball, if you were playing the way we did.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Wait!\u2019 I said, holding up my hand. \u2018I have played dodgeball. And kickball.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Really.\u2019</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m impressed. And they aren\u2019t even indoor sports.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, it was, actually. At school, in the gym.\u2019 He raised his eyebrows. \u2018What? It\u2019s the same game.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Actually it\u2019s not,\u2019 he said.</p><p>\u2018Come on.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Seriously. There\u2019s school rules, and neighborhood rules. The two are very different.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Says who?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Anybody who has played both,\u2019 he said, tossing the ball back. \u2018Trust me.\u2019</p><p>Now, my mother took another sip of her wine. \u2018Oh, I almost forgot,\u2019 she said. \u2018A packet has arrived for you. From Defriese. Orientation information, I\u2019m assuming. Would you like for me to open it?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sure,\u2019 I said. \u2018Thanks.\u2019</p><p>There was the sound of paper tearing, then crinkling. She sighed. \u2018As I suspected. Meal plan info, updated transcript requests, a roommate questionnaire... which is due at the end of the week, apparently.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Really.\u2019</p><p>\u2018For God\u2019s sake.\u2019 She groaned. \u2018It\u2019s like a compatibility test! \u201cWhat activities do you enjoy?\u201d \u201cWould you say you are a workaholic, or more carefree with your studies?\u201d What is this, higher education or Internet dating?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Just stick it in the mail to me,\u2019 I said. \u2018I\u2019ll get it back as fast as I can.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And if you\u2019re late, you\u2019ll end up with some carefree, activity-loving roommate. We\u2019re better off filling it out now,\u2019 she muttered. \u2018Oh, wait a moment. There\u2019s a second page here, where you can request \u201calternate living arrangements\u201d.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Meaning what?\u2019</p><p>She didn\u2019t say anything for a moment, busy reading. Then, \u2018There are certain floors and dorms you can request where everyone has a specific focus, such as foreign languages or sports. Let me just... ah. Perfect.\u2019</p><p>I heard a pen scritching. \u2018What\u2019s perfect?\u2019</p><p>\u2018The Pembleton Program,\u2019 she replied. \u2018I just signed you up for it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019</p><p>She cleared her throat, then read aloud. \u2018\u201cHoused in a dorm removed from the main campus, the Pembleton Program offers academically strong students an environment dedicated solely to their studies. With single rooms, on-site research materials, and close access to both libraries, members of Pembleton are free to focus on their work without the distractions of regular dorm life.\u201d\u2019</p><p>\u2018Which means...\u2019</p><p>\u2018No roommate, no parties, no nonsense. It\u2019s just what you want.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Um,\u2019 I said. \u2018I don\u2019t know. It sounds kind of restrictive, don\u2019t you think?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Not at all,\u2019 she replied. \u2018You won\u2019t have to deal with drunk frat boys and hormonal, gossiping girls. It\u2019s ideal. Now, I\u2019ll just sign your name here, and we can \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t,\u2019 I said quickly. I could feel her surprise, could see her on the other end of the phone, pen in hand, eyebrows raised. \u2018I mean, I\u2019m not really sure I want to live there.\u2019</p><p>Silence. Then, \u2018Auden. I don\u2019t think you understand how distracting it can be to live in a dorm environment. There are people who come to college purely for the social life. Do you really want to be stuck in a room with someone like that?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 I said. \u2018But I don\u2019t want to spend every single second studying either.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh.\u2019 Her voice was flat. \u2018I suppose this is part of your blossoming, then? Suddenly school isn\u2019t important anymore, just boys and girlfriends and clothes?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Of course not. But \u2013\u2019</p><p>A sigh, loud, filling my ear. \u2018I should have known spending the summer with Heidi would do this to you,\u2019 she said. \u2018I spend eighteen years teaching you about the importance of taking yourself seriously, and in a matter of weeks you\u2019re wearing pink bikinis and totally boy crazy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Mom,\u2019 I said, my voice rising. \u2018This isn\u2019t about Heidi.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 she shot back. \u2018It\u2019s about your sudden lack of drive and focus. How could you let yourself get this way?\u2019</p><p>Hearing this, I had a flash of my dad, attributing all I\u2019d done to the name he\u2019d chosen for me. All the good was their doing; the bad, mine. I bit my lip. \u2018I haven\u2019t changed,\u2019 I told her. \u2018This is just me.\u2019</p><p>Silence. And I knew, within it, that the fact this might be true was worse than any frat boy or pink bikini ever could be.</p><p>\u2018Well, I\u2019ll just stick this in the mail.\u2019 She drew in a breath, stiff, formal. \u2018You make your own decision.\u2019</p><p>I swallowed. \u2018Okay.\u2019</p><p>For a moment, neither of us said anything, and I wondered what could possibly follow this. How we could come back from such an impasse, this huge expanse stretching between us. There were a million different ways, I was sure, but my mom surprised me by not choosing any of them. Instead, she hung up, leaving me with a simple click, the last word, and no idea where to go from here. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Apparently, conflict was contagious, or at least in the air. When I left my room about twenty minutes later to head to work, Thisbe\u2019s waves had stopped, and another steady noise was coming from her room: the sound of bickering.</p><p>\u2018Of course you deserve a night out,\u2019 my father was saying. \u2018I\u2019m just not sure tonight is the right one, is all I\u2019m saying.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why not?\u2019 Heidi asked. I could hear Thisbe making noises in the background. \u2018I\u2019ll be back for the nine o\u2019clock feeding, the baby\u2019s just had a nap...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nine o\u2019clock!</p> <p>It\u2019s only five thirty right now!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Robert, we\u2019re having cocktails and dinner.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Where? Istanbul?\u2019 my dad said. \u2018There\u2019s no way that will take three and a half hours.\u2019</p><p>There was a prolonged silence. I didn\u2019t have to peek inside to imagine the look on Heidi\u2019s face. Finally my dad said, \u2018Honey, I want you to go have fun. But it\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve been alone with a newborn for that long, and I just...\u2019</p><p>\u2018She\u2019s not a newborn. She\u2019s your daughter.\u2019 Thisbe sputtered, as if agreeing with this. \u2018You\u2019ve raised two lovely children. You can do this. Now go ahead and take her so I can go finish getting ready.\u2019</p> <p>I heard my dad start to say something, but then the door was opening, and I darted out of sight. Not fast enough, though.</p><p>\u2018Auden?\u2019 he called out. \u2018Could you \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, she can\u2019t,\u2019 Heidi said over her shoulder. Then she nudged me forward. \u2018Keep walking. He\u2019s fine.\u2019</p><p>When we got to the stairs, I turned to look at her. Instead of the Heidi I\u2019d gotten used to seeing, clad in sweats and a ponytail, dark circles perennially under her eyes, this was a different woman entirely. Her hair was sleek, her makeup done, and she was wearing dark jeans, heels, and a fitted black top, a silver necklace with a key studded with red stones around her neck. This I recognized: we\u2019d just gotten them in at the store the previous week, and they were already selling like hotcakes.</p><p>\u2018Wow,\u2019 I said. \u2018You look great.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You think?\u2019 She glanced down at herself. \u2018It\u2019s been so long since I could wear this stuff I didn\u2019t even know if it would fit. I guess stress does burn a lot of calories, after all.\u2019</p> <p>Down the hall, I could hear Thisbe beginning to fuss. Heidi looked over, then turned on her heel, walking to her bedroom. I followed her to the doorway, leaning against it as she picked up her purse from the bed.</p><p>\u2018So I have to say,\u2019 I said as she rummaged around, finally pulling out a lip gloss, \u2018you sure seem different all of a sudden. And it\u2019s not just the clothes.\u2019</p><p>Thisbe was really crying now. Heidi bit her lip, then uncapped the gloss, putting some on. \u2018You\u2019re right,\u2019 she said. \u2018I just... I\u2019ve realized over the last couple of weeks that I needed to take some time for myself. We\u2019ve talked about it a lot, actually.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You and Dad?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Me and Karen.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Really,\u2019 I said.</p><p>She nodded, dropping the gloss back in the bag. \u2018Ever since the baby was born I\u2019ve been so hesitant to ask your dad for any help. I\u2019m so used to doing everything myself, and it wasn\u2019t like he was really offering much.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Or any,\u2019 I said.</p> <p>\u2018But Karen kept pointing out that you and your brother were just fine, and he was your dad as well. She said it takes two to make a baby, and at least that many to raise one well. Usually more.\u2019 She smiled. \u2018She made me promise her that I\u2019d set up that girls\u2019 night my friends have been wanting forever. I was dragging my feet, though, until Laura came. When she said pretty much the same thing, I figured they had to be onto something.\u2019</p><p>I watched as she checked her hair in the mirror, adjusting a piece in front. \u2018I didn\u2019t realize you and Laura talked when she was here.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, we didn\u2019t at first,\u2019 she replied, picking up her purse. \u2018To be honest, she kind of scared the crap out of me. Not exactly the warmest person, you know?\u2019</p><p>I nodded. \u2018No kidding.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But then the night before they left, I was up late with Thisbe, and she came down for a glass of water. At first she was just sitting there, watching us, and eventually I asked her if she wanted to hold her. She said yes, so I handed her over, and then we just started talking. There\u2019s a lot more to her than it seems at first glance.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You should tell my mother that,\u2019 I said. \u2018She hates her.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Of course she does,\u2019 she said. \u2018It\u2019s because they\u2019re so similar. They both have that whole cold, bitchy, wary-ofall-other-women thing going on. It\u2019s like two magnets repelling each other.\u2019</p><p>I thought of my mother just moments earlier on the phone, her voice so sharp and dismissive. If I wasn\u2019t like her, she didn\u2019t care to know who I was. \u2018So you think my mom has more to her than that, as well?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Of course she does. She has to.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Because...\u2019</p><p>She looked at me. \u2018Because she raised you. And Hollis. And she was in love with your father for a very long time. Truly cold bitches don\u2019t do that.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What do they do?\u2019</p><p>\u2018They end up alone.\u2019</p><p>I raised my eyebrows. \u2018You sound awfully sure about that.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I am,\u2019 she said. \u2018Because I was one.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You?\u2019 I said. \u2018No way.\u2019</p><p>She smiled. \u2018Someday I\u2019ll tell you all about it. But now, I\u2019ve got to run and kiss my daughter and then try to leave without having a breakdown. Okay?\u2019</p><p>I nodded and was still standing there, trying to process this, as she started into the hallway. When she passed me, she paused, bending down to quickly kiss my forehead before moving on, the smell of her perfume lingering behind her. Maybe it was to prove her point. Or just instinct. Either way, it was surprising. But not as much as the fact that I didn\u2019t really mind it, not at all.</p><p>Later that night, I was walking to the Gas/Gro after work when I heard a car coming up behind me. A moment later, a newspaper landed with a slap at my feet.</p><p>I looked at it, then at Eli, who was now pulling up beside me. \u2018So you have a paper route now?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Technically,\u2019 he replied as I picked up the paper, noticing the stacks of others piled up in the back of the truck, \u2018my friend Roger has a paper route. But he also has the flu, so I\u2019m helping him out. Plus, I thought it might apply to your quest.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Delivering papers?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sure.\u2019 He stopped the car, gesturing for me to open the passenger door. When I did, he said, \u2018It\u2019s a rite of passage. My first job was delivering the Colby Coupon Clipper on my bike.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve had jobs,\u2019 I told him.</p><p>\u2018Yeah? What were they?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I worked for a professor in the English department one summer, helping with a bibliography for his book,\u2019 I said, as I slid inside. \u2018Then I worked for my mom\u2019s accountant as an office assistant. And all last year I did test prep at Huntsinger.\u2019</p><p>Personally, I\u2019d always thought this was a pretty impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Eli, however, just gave me a flat look. \u2018You,\u2019 he said, hitting the gas, \u2018definitely need a paper route. At least for one night.\u2019</p><p>And so it was that, after hitting the Washroom, and Park Mart for a few incidentals, we pulled into a neighborhood just past the pier, driving slowly with a stack of papers between us, and a list of subscriber addresses in his hand. It was just after two A.M.</p><p>\u2018Eleven hundred,\u2019 Eli said, nodding at a split-level off to the right. \u2018That\u2019s all you.\u2019</p><p>I picked up a paper, getting a good grip, then tossed it toward the driveway. It hit the curb, then bounced into a pile of lawn clippings, disappearing entirely. \u2018Whoops,\u2019 I said. He pulled to a stop and I jumped out, retrieving it and throwing it again, this time doing a bit better, hitting the far right of the driveway. \u2018It\u2019s harder than it looks,\u2019 I told him when I finally got back in the car.</p> <p>\u2018Most things are,\u2019 Eli said. Then, of course, he grabbed a paper, launching it at a house across the street in a perfect arc. It landed right on the front stoop, the delivery version of a perfect ten. When I just looked at him, speechless, he shrugged. \u2018Colby Coupon Clipper, I told you. Two years.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Still,\u2019 I said. My next shot was a bit better, but too wide. It hit the lawn, and again I had to get out to move it to a safer, less wet spot. \u2018God, I suck at this.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s your second one,\u2019 he said before launching another perfect shot at a bungalow with a plastic flamingo in the front yard.</p><p>\u2018Still,\u2019 I said again.</p><p>I could feel him watching me as I threw another one, concentrating hard. It hit the steps (good) but then banked into the nearby bushes (not so good). When I came back from retrieving it, some brambles in my hair, my frustration must have been obvious.</p><p>\u2018You know,\u2019 Eli said, tossing another paper and hitting another front stoop \u2013 thwack! \u2013 \u2018it\u2019s okay not to be good at everything.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018This is delivering papers.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So?\u2019</p><p>\u2018So,\u2019 I said as he did another perfect throw, Jesus, \u2018I\u2019m all right if I suck at, say, quantum physics. Or Mandarin Chinese. Because those things are hard, and take work.\u2019</p><p>He watched, silent, as I missed yet another driveway. By about a mile. When I returned he said, \u2018And clearly, this doesn\u2019t.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s different,\u2019 I told him. \u2018Look, achievement is my thing, okay? It\u2019s what I do. It\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever been good at.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re good at doing well,\u2019 he said, clarifying.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m good,\u2019 I said, throwing another paper and doing marginally better, \u2018at learning. Because I never had to involve anyone else in that. It was just me, and the subject matter.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Indoors, working away,\u2019 he added.</p> <p>I shot him a look, but, as usual, he did not seem deterred. Or bothered in the least. He just handed me another paper, which I launched at the next house. It hit the driveway, a bit too much to the left, but he drove on anyway.</p><p>\u2018Life is full of screwups,\u2019 he said, chucking another paper at a split-level before taking the corner. \u2018You\u2019re supposed to fail sometimes. It\u2019s a required part of the human existence.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve failed,\u2019 I told him.</p><p>\u2018Yeah? At what?\u2019</p><p>I blanked for a moment, not exactly good for my argument. \u2018I told you,\u2019 I said, \u2018I was a social failure.\u2019</p><p>He took another turn, tossing a couple more papers as we cruised down a dark street. \u2018You didn\u2019t try to be homecoming queen and lose, though.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well,\u2019 I said, \u2018I never wanted to be homecoming queen. Or any of that stuff.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Then you didn\u2019t fail. You just opted out. There\u2019s a difference.\u2019</p><p>I considered this as we cruised down another street. He wasn\u2019t even handing me papers anymore, just throwing them all himself. \u2018What about you, then?\u2019 I asked. \u2018What did you fail at?\u2019</p><p>\u2018The better question,\u2019 he said, slowing for a stop sign, \u2018is what didn\u2019t I fail at.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Really.\u2019</p><p>He nodded, then held up a hand and began to count off, finger by finger. \u2018Algebra. Football. Lacey McIntyre. Skate-boarding on a half-pipe...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Lacey McIntyre?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Eighth grade. Spent months working up to asking her to a dance, and she shot me down cold. In full view of the entire lunchroom.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Ouch.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Tell me about it.\u2019 He turned again, going down a narrow street with only a few houses on it. Thwack. Thwack. \u2018Winning over Belissa\u2019s dad, who still hates me. Convincing my little brother not to be such a chump. Learning to fix my own car.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Wow. This is a long list.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I told you. I\u2019m very good at being bad at things.\u2019</p><p>I glanced over at him again as we came to another stop sign. \u2018So you never get discouraged.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Of course I do,\u2019 he said. \u2018Failing sucks. But it\u2019s better than the alternative.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Which is?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Not even trying.\u2019 Now he did look at me, straight on. \u2018Life\u2019s short, you know?\u2019</p><p>I\u2019d never met Abe. Or even heard much about him, aside from the few things Maggie and Leah had said. But suddenly, in that moment, it was like I could feel him. Sitting in the very seat where I was, riding along with us. Maybe he\u2019d been there the whole time.</p><p>Eli took another turn, and I realized we were in my dad\u2019s neighborhood, the surroundings suddenly familiar. His house was quickly approaching, and on my side to boot. It had to be a sign. I reached over, picking up a paper from the stack between us. \u2018Okay,\u2019 I said. \u2018This one\u2019s mine.\u2019</p><p>I drew back my hand, trying to use my elbow for leverage the way I\u2019d seen him do, and this time aimed not for the driveway but the porch. It came closer, closer, and at the exact right minute, I let it fly, watching as it arced high over the lawn... before landing with a slap on the windshield of Heidi\u2019s Prius. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Eli slowed to a stop. \u2018I know it\u2019s family,\u2019 he said, \u2018but that demands a do-over.\u2019</p><p>I slid out of the car \u2013 again \u2013 and walked over to grab the paper, tucking it under my arm. Then I crept up as slowly as possible to the porch, trying to be quiet as I bent to slide it onto the perfect center of the mat. Just as I did, though, I heard my dad\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u2018... just my point! I wanted you to have what you wanted. But what about what I want?\u2019</p><p>I shrank from the door, backing down one step as I glanced at my watch. It was almost three A.M. Entirely too late for most people to be up, unless something bad was happening.</p> <p>\u2018Are you saying you don\u2019t want the baby?\u2019 Heidi said. Her voice was higher, shaky. \u2018Because if that\u2019s true...\u2019</p><p>\u2018This isn\u2019t about the baby.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Then what is it about?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Our lives,\u2019 he replied, sounding tired. \u2018And how they\u2019ve changed.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ve done this before, Robert. Twice. You knew what it was like to have an infant in the house.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I was a child myself then!</p><p>I\u2019m older now. It\u2019s different. It\u2019s...\u2019</p><p>Silence. All I could hear was Eli\u2019s car, the engine murmuring behind me.</p><p>\u2018... not what I expected,\u2019 my dad finished. \u2018You want the truth, there it is. I wasn\u2019t ready for all this.\u2019</p><p>All this. Such a round, all-encompassing term, as wide as the ocean, which I could also hear, distantly \u2013 the real waves this time. But even with all that vastness, it was impossible to tell what, or who, it really included. It seemed safest to just assume everything.</p><p>\u2018This,\u2019 Heidi said, \u2018is your family. Ready or not, Robert.\u2019</p> <p>I had a flash of all those cul-de-sac games I never really played, but knew the rules to nonetheless. You hide: whoever is It counts down, and then \u2013 ready or not! \u2013 they came looking for you. If they got close, you had no choice but to stay put, hoping not to be found. But if you were, there was no wiggle room. Game over.</p><p>I could hear my father starting to say something, but I wasn\u2019t a child this time, and didn\u2019t have to stay and listen. I could leave, disappear into the night, which was vast, too, wide and all-encompassing, with so many places to hide. So I did.</p><p>\u2018Forgive the mess,\u2019 Eli said, reaching inside the dark room for a light switch. \u2018Housework is another one of my failings.\u2019</p><p>In truth, his apartment was simply plain. One large room, with a bed on one side, a single wooden chair and TV on the other. The kitchen was tiny, the counters bare except for a coffeemaker, a box of filters beside it. Still, I appreciated his efforts to pretend otherwise, if only because it meant we weren\u2019t talking about the fact that I\u2019d pretty much lost it only moments earlier.</p><p>I thought I\u2019d been fine as I backed away from my dad\u2019s house, walking across the already dew-damp grass to the truck. Fine as I slid in, picking up another paper to throw. But then, Eli had said, \u2018Hey. You okay?\u2019 and the next thing I knew, I wasn\u2019t.</p><p>It\u2019s always embarrassing to cry in front of anyone. But bursting into tears in front of Eli was downright humiliating. Maybe it was the way he just sat there, not saying anything, the only sound my hiccuping sobs and loud sniffles. Or how, after a moment, he just drove on, throwing papers at houses while I looked out the window and tried to stop. By the time he\u2019d pulled into the dark driveway of a green split-level house a block from the boardwalk, I\u2019d gotten calmed down enough to be racking my brain for some way to play the whole thing off. I was thinking I\u2019d blame sudden-onset PMS, or maybe my devastation at sucking so entirely at paper delivering. Before I could say anything, though, he cut the engine, pushing his door open.</p><p>\u2018Come on,\u2019 he said. As he got out, I sat there for a moment, watching as he began to climb a narrow flight of stairs beside the garage. He never looked back to see if I was following him. Which was probably why I did.</p><p>Now, he shut the door behind me, then walked over to the kitchen, dropping his keys on the counter en route to turning on the coffeemaker. Only when it began to brew, the smell wafting toward me, did I go to join him.</p> <p>\u2018Have a seat,\u2019 he said, his back to me as he bent into the fridge, rummaging around for something. \u2018There\u2019s a chair.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And only a chair,\u2019 I said. \u2018What do you do when you have company?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t.\u2019 He stood up, shutting the fridge. He had a stick of butter in one hand. \u2018I mean, usually.\u2019</p><p>I didn\u2019t say anything, instead just watching as he pulled a saucepan out of a cabinet, sticking the butter in it before placing it on the stove. \u2018Look,\u2019 I said as he turned on the burner, \u2018what happened back there \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s okay,\u2019 he said. \u2018We don\u2019t have to talk about it.\u2019</p><p>I was quiet for a minute, watching as he melted the butter in the pan, tipping it from side to side. It was just another courtesy that he\u2019d given me this easy out, the chance to move on, and I thought it was a gift I\u2019d take, and gratefully. Until I heard myself say, \u2018Remember how you were asking me what I\u2019d failed at, earlier?\u2019</p><p>He nodded, jiggling the pan over the stove. \u2018Yeah. The social thing, right?\u2019</p><p>\u2018That,\u2019 I said, \u2018and keeping my parents together.\u2019</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until I said this that I realized it was true. That I hadn\u2019t blanked out at this question earlier so much as thought of an answer I couldn\u2019t say aloud. At least until I\u2019d overheard my dad and Heidi fighting, and it all came rushing back to me: those awkward dinners, with the picky little arguments, the unsettled feel of the house as the hours went on and on, closer to my bedtime. The way I learned to stretch the night all around me, staying awake and alert to keep all the things that scared me most at bay. But it hadn\u2019t worked. Not then. And not now either.</p><p>I blinked, feeling a tear roll down my cheek. Three years of total stoicism, blown in one night. Talk about humiliating.</p><p>\u2018Hey. Auden.\u2019</p><p>I looked up to see Eli watching me. He\u2019d taken out a box of Rice Krispies at some point, and instead of looking back at him I focused on the faces of Snap, Crackle, and Pop, all gathered happily around a big cereal bowl. \u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 I said, because for some reason, even with these cartoon distractions I still seemed to be crying. \u2018I just... I don\u2019t even think about this anymore, but then when I went to throw that paper, they were fighting, and it was so...\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He put the box down, then came over to the opposite side of the island. He didn\u2019t try to reach out for me, or touch me. He just stood there, near, as he said, \u2018Who was fighting?\u2019</p><p>I swallowed. \u2018My dad and Heidi. Things have been pretty bumpy since Isby came, and tonight I guess things just blew up, or something.\u2019</p><p>God, I was still blubbering. My voice was all choked, coming in little gaspy sobs. Eli said, \u2018Just because people fight doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re splitting up.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know that.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I mean, my parents used to go at it sometimes. It just kind of cleared the air, you know? It was always better afterward.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know my dad, though,\u2019 I said. \u2018I\u2019ve seen him do this before.\u2019</p><p>\u2018People change.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Or they don\u2019t,\u2019 I replied. Finally I made myself look at him. Those green eyes, long lashes. His haunted face, not as haunted anymore. \u2018Sometimes, they don\u2019t.\u2019</p><p>He just stood there, looking at me, and I had this flash of us, here in this little garage apartment, in the middle of the night. From up above, in a plane passing over, you\u2019d just see one little light in all this dark, with no idea of the lives that were being lived within it, and in the house beside, and beside that one. So much happening in the world, night and day, hour by hour. It was no wonder we were meant to sleep, if only to check out of it for a little while.</p> <p>There was a sudden crackling pop from the stove, and Eli looked over his shoulder. \u2018Whoops,\u2019 he said, turning back to the saucepan and pulling it off the heat. \u2018One sec, let me just finish these.\u2019</p><p>I wiped my hand beneath my eyes, trying to collect myself. \u2018What are you doing over there, anyway?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Making Rice Krispie treats.\u2019</p><p>This seemed so odd, and incongruous, it almost made sense. Along with everything else that night. Still, I felt compelled to ask \u2018Why?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Because it\u2019s what my mom always did when my sisters were crying.\u2019 He glanced back at me. \u2018I don\u2019t know. I told you, I never have company. You were upset, and it just seemed...\u2019</p><p>He trailed off, and I looked around the room, taking in the plain bed, the one chair. The single light outside the door, glowing yellow and bright, all night long.</p> <p>\u2018... perfect,\u2019 I finished for him. \u2018It\u2019s perfect.\u2019</p><p>Of course, nothing is really perfect. But Eli\u2019s Rice Krispie treats were pretty close. We ate half a pan while we split the pot of coffee, using the one chair as a table, each of us sitting on the floor on either side of it.</p><p>\u2018So let me guess,\u2019 I said, putting my mug on the floor by my feet. \u2018You\u2019re a minimalist.\u2019</p><p>He glanced around the room, then back at me. \u2018You think?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Eli,\u2019 I said. \u2018You have one chair.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah. But just because all the furniture at my old place was Abe\u2019s.\u2019</p><p>Hearing this, it was all I could do not to start, or jump, so jarring was it to hear him say his name, after all this time. Instead, I took another sip of my coffee. \u2018Really.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah.\u2019 He sat back, picking a bit of sticky crumb off the side of the Rice Krispie pan. \u2018The minute he made some prize money riding, he was all about decorating our place. And he bought the stupidest stuff. Huge TV, singing fish...\u2019</p> <p>\u2018A singing fish?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You know, those plastic ones that you hang on the wall, and when you walk by they start singing, like, some Motown song?\u2019 I just looked at him. \u2018Okay, so you don\u2019t know. Consider yourself lucky. Ours was, like, the center of our apartment. He put it right by the door, so it went off constantly, and everyone had to listen to it.\u2019</p><p>I smiled. \u2018Sounds interesting.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s not the word I\u2019d choose.\u2019 He shook his head. \u2018Plus he insisted on buying these big papasan chairs, you know the ones that are circular, filled with squishy cushions? I wanted a plain, normal couch. But no. We had to have these stupid things that everyone was always getting sucked down into. No one could ever get up and out of them on their own. We were always having to pull people out, like a freaking rescue mission.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Come on.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m totally serious. It was ridiculous.\u2019 He sighed. \u2018And then there was the whole water bed thing. He said he\u2019d always wanted one. Even when it leaked, and gave him a crazy backache, he would not admit it was a mistake. \u201cI must have spilled something,\u201d he\u2019d say, or \u201cI really pulled a muscle on that last ride.\u201d He was hobbling around like an old man, complaining constantly. All night long, all I could hear was him thrashing around, trying to get comfortable. It was, like, an endless squishing.\u2019</p><p>I laughed, picking up my mug again. \u2018So what happened? Did he finally give it up?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 he said. \u2018He died.\u2019</p><p>I knew this, of course. But even so, hearing it this way was like a shock to the system, all over again. \u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 I said. \u2018I \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018See, but that\u2019s the thing, though.\u2019 He sat back, shaking his head. \u2018Everyone always wants to tell these stories, all the stories. It\u2019s all anyone wanted to do at the funeral, and after. Oh, remember this thing, and this, and what about this? But the ending to every story is the same. He dies. That\u2019s never going to change. So why even bother?\u2019</p><p>We were both quiet for a moment. \u2018I guess,\u2019 I said finally, \u2018that for some people, it\u2019s how they remember. You know, by telling the stories. It keeps the person close.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But I don\u2019t have that problem,\u2019 he said quietly. \u2018Not remembering.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You want to talk about failure?\u2019 He looked up at me, meeting my eyes. \u2018Try being the one who was driving. Who got to live.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Eli,\u2019 I said. I tried to keep my voice low, even, the way his had been when he\u2019d been reassuring me. \u2018It wasn\u2019t your fault. It was an accident.\u2019</p><p>He shook his head. \u2018Maybe. But the bottom line is, I\u2019m here and he\u2019s not. And everyone who sees me \u2013 his parents, his girlfriend, his friends \u2013 they know that. In all the uncertainty, it\u2019s the one thing they know for sure. And it sucks.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sure they don\u2019t hold it against you,\u2019 I said.</p><p>\u2018They don\u2019t have to.\u2019 He looked down at his mug, then up at me. \u2018The whole do-over thing, that\u2019s all I think about since it happened. What if we\u2019d left that party earlier, or later. If I\u2019d seen the car coming at us and not stopping, a moment sooner. If he\u2019d been driving instead of me. There are a million variables, and if even one was different... maybe everything would be.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We were both quiet for a moment. Finally I said, \u2018You can\u2019t think like that, though. You\u2019ll make yourself crazy.\u2019</p><p>He gave me a wry smile. \u2018Tell me about it.\u2019</p><p>I started to say something, but then he was getting to his feet, picking up the tray and taking it to the kitchen. Just as he did, I heard a thump from the wall by his bed, followed by another. I stood up, walking closer, and listened again.</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s the McConners,\u2019 Eli said from the kitchen.</p> <p>\u2018The who?\u2019</p><p>He came over, standing behind me. \u2018The McConners. They own this house. Their son\u2019s room is right through that wall.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh,\u2019 I said.</p><p>\u2018He usually wakes up once or twice a night. Asks for water, you know, the whole thing.\u2019 Eli sat down on his bed, the springs creaking beneath him. \u2018If it\u2019s really quiet, I can hear every word.\u2019</p><p>I sat down beside him, listening hard. But all I could make out was two voices murmuring: one high, one lower. It was kind of like Heidi\u2019s waves, distant white noise.</p> <p>\u2018I used to do that,\u2019 Eli said. We were both whispering. \u2018The whole waking up, wanting water thing, when I was a kid. I remember it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Not me,\u2019 I told him. \u2018My parents needed their sleep.\u2019</p><p>He shook his head, lying back on the bed, folding his arms over his chest. Through the wall, the negotiations continued, the higher voice rising, urgent, the lower one staying level. \u2018You were always thinking of them, huh?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Pretty much.\u2019 I stifled a yawn, then looked at my watch. It was four thirty, about when I usually headed home. Through the wall, the voices kept going, and, still listening, I slid down next to Eli, resting my head on his chest. His T-shirt was soft beneath my head, and smelled like the detergent I knew he used at the Washroom.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s late,\u2019 I said quietly. \u2018He should go to sleep.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Not always so easy.\u2019 His voice was low, slow, too, and I felt his lips brush the top of my head, gently.</p> <p>The light was still on in Eli\u2019s kitchen, but it became muted as I closed my eyes, still hearing those murmurings behind me. Shh, shh, everything\u2019s all right, I was sure I heard a voice say. Or maybe it was the one in my head, my mantra. Shh, Shh. \u2018It\u2019s not your fault,\u2019 I said to Eli, my voice sounding thick to my own ears. \u2018You\u2019re not to blame.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Neither are you,\u2019 he answered. Shh. Shh. It\u2019s all right.</p><p>It was so late. Late for children, late for anyone. I knew I should get to my feet, go down those stairs, and find my way home, but already I could feel something happening. A feeling, thick and heavy, creeping over me. It had been so long since I\u2019d done this that for a moment a part of me was scared, wanting to fight it off, stay vigilant. But instead, just before it took me, I rolled over, pressing myself closer against him. I felt his hand rise to my head and then, I was gone.</p><p>When I woke up the next morning, it was seven thirty and Eli was still sleeping. His arm was around my waist, his chest moving slowly up, down, up, down, beneath my cheek. I closed my eyes again, trying to drift back, but the sunlight was slanting in overhead, the day already begun.</p><p>I eased myself away from him, getting to my feet, but then stood watching his face, relaxed and dreaming, for a few moments. I knew I should tell him good-bye, but I didn\u2019t want to wake him. Plus, I had no idea what I could say in a note that would possibly convey how grateful I was to him for everything he\u2019d done for me the night before. In the end, I did the closest thing I could: I refilled the coffee-maker, put fresh grounds in a new filter, and flipped the switch. It was already brewing as I slipped outside and made my way down his steps to the street.</p><p>It was one of those gorgeous beach mornings, bright and sunny already, everything enhanced with the benefit of actual nighttime sleep. Walking the four blocks or so back home, I was more aware than ever of the salt in the air, the beauty of the rambling roses climbing along someone\u2019s fence, even the friendliness I felt toward the bicyclist I passed, an older woman with a long braid, wearing a crazy orange jogging suit and whistling to herself. She returned my wide smile, lifting a hand to wave as I made my way up the front walk.</p><p>I was so immersed in all this \u2013 the night, the sleep, the morning \u2013 that I didn\u2019t even see my dad until I was about to walk right into him. But there he was, in the foyer at this early hour, already showered and dressed.</p><p>\u2018Hey,\u2019 I said. \u2018You\u2019re up early. Did inspiration strike or something? Ready to start another book already?\u2019</p> <p>He glanced up the stairs. \u2018Um,\u2019 he said. \u2018Not exactly. Actually I was just... I\u2019m headed out.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh.\u2019 I stopped. \u2018Where are you going? Campus?\u2019</p><p>A pause. Right then, in that too-long beat of silence, I got the first inkling that something was wrong. \u2018No. I\u2019m going to a hotel for a couple of nights.\u2019 He swallowed, then looked down at his hands. His face was tired. \u2018Heidi and I... we have some things to work out, and we decided this was the best thing. For now.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re leaving?\u2019 Even the word sounded wrong, said aloud.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s only temporary.\u2019 He took in a breath, then let it out. \u2018Trust me, this is better. For the baby, for everyone. I\u2019ll just be at the Condor; we can still see each other every day.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re leaving?\u2019 I said again. Still weird.</p><p>He bent down, picking up the bag I\u2019d not spotted until now, which was by the stairs. \u2018It\u2019s complicated,\u2019 he said. \u2018Just give us some time. Okay?\u2019</p><p>I just stood there, speechless, as he walked past me to the door, pulling it open. Here I was, with finally a chance to say everything I hadn\u2019t two years earlier, the do-over of all do-overs. I could have asked him to reconsider, to think of other options. To stay. And yet nothing came. Nothing. I just watched him go, again.</p><p>I stood there for a long time, thinking this had to be a joke. It wasn\u2019t until I had watched him pull out of the garage, flip down his sun visor, and drive off that I walked over and locked the door.</p><p>When I went upstairs, Heidi\u2019s door was closed, but as I passed Isby\u2019s room, I heard something. Not surprisingly, at first, I assumed it was a cry. But listening another minute, I realized it wasn\u2019t. Tentatively, I pushed open the door, peering in. She was in her bassinette, looking up at her mobile, waving her arms around. Not wailing. Not shrieking. Even though these would have been perfectly acceptable and expected any day, but especially this one. Instead, she was just murmuring, making little baby noises. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I went closer, to the edge of her bassinette, and peered down at her. For a moment, she kept kicking, intent on the ceiling, but then she suddenly looked at me. Her face relaxed, changing entirely into something new, something amazing. A smile.</p><p>Chapter THIRTEEN</p><p>\u2018I didn\u2019t even want to call you,\u2019 I heard Heidi say. \u2018I was sure you\u2019d just tell me you told me so.\u2019</p><p>For three hours I\u2019d been up in my room, trying to fall back asleep, but with no luck. Instead, I\u2019d just lain there, remembering it all again: waking up so happy with Eli, my walk home, and then being blindsided by my dad\u2019s departure, take two. But of all these images, it was Isby\u2019s smile, so sweet and unexpected, that had stuck with me the most. Whenever I closed my eyes to try and sleep, it was all I could see.</p> <p>\u2018No, not really,\u2019 Heidi continued. \u2018But I wouldn\u2019t blame you. It\u2019s just such a mess. I still can\u2019t believe any of this is happening.\u2019</p><p>I walked past the table, where she was sitting, the baby in her arms, and headed to the cupboard to get myself a mug. Outside, it was another bright and sunny day, gorgeous like all the others.</p><p>\u2018Hey,\u2019 Heidi said suddenly, glancing at me, \u2018let me call you back. No, I will. Okay, then you call me. Ten minutes. All right. Bye.\u2019</p><p>She hung up, and I could feel her watching me as I poured myself a cup of coffee. Finally she said, \u2018So, Auden. Can you sit down a sec? I... I have to talk to you about something.\u2019</p><p>She sounded so sad and worried I could barely stand it. \u2018It\u2019s okay, I already know,\u2019 I said, turning around. \u2018I talked to Dad.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Oh.\u2019 She swallowed, looking down at the baby again. \u2018Well, that\u2019s good. What did he...\u2019</p><p>Isby suddenly let out a little squawk. Instead of crying, though, she just buried her face in Heidi\u2019s chest, closing her eyes.</p><p>\u2018He said you guys had some stuff to work out,\u2019 I said. \u2018And that he was staying at the Condor for a while.\u2019</p><p>She nodded, her face looking pained. \u2018So,\u2019 she said, \u2018are you doing okay?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Me?\u2019 I said. \u2018I\u2019m fine. Why wouldn\u2019t I be?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, this is kind of unsettling, I\u2019m sure,\u2019 she said. \u2018I just... you can talk to me anytime, all right? If you have questions, or concerns...\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I\u2019m fine,\u2019 I said again. \u2018Really.\u2019</p><p>Just then, I heard a buzzing noise: Heidi\u2019s phone. She glanced at it, then sighed, putting it to her ear. \u2018Hello?\u2019 she said. \u2018Hi, Elaine. No, no, I got your messages, I just... How are you? Right. Of course. Well, to be honest, I haven\u2019t had much of a chance to think about the Bash yet...\u2019</p><p>She stood, shifting Isby in her arms, and walked over to the glass doors, still talking. I sat there, thinking of how I watched my dad driving away earlier, the way it felt like another do-over, but with the same outcome. Maybe some things could never change, or be fixed, even with time.</p><p>A moment later, Heidi returned to the kitchen, putting her phone down on the counter. \u2018That was Elaine, the chair of the Colby Visitors\u2019 Council,\u2019 she said in a flat voice. \u2018She wants a theme for the Beach Bash, and she wants it now.\u2019</p><p>\u2018The Beach Bash?\u2019 I said.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s this annual event we have at the end of every summer,\u2019 she explained, sitting down again. \u2018It\u2019s in the hall on the boardwalk. We sell tickets, all the merchants participate, it\u2019s the last big thing of the summer. And for some reason, I always volunteer to organize it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Really.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s total masochism.\u2019 She shook her head. \u2018Anyway, last year, I did a pirate theme, which was kind of cute. The year before, we did a whole Renaissance thing. But this year... I mean, what am I going to do? I\u2019m not exactly in a festive place right now.\u2019</p> <p>I watched her as she ran a hand over Isby\u2019s cheek, then tucked the blanket more tightly around her. \u2018You\u2019ll think of something.\u2019</p><p>Just then, her phone rang again. She picked it up, settling it between her ear and shoulder. \u2018Hi, Morgan. No, it\u2019s fine. I was just talking to Elaine.\u2019 She sighed, shaking her head. \u2018I know. And I appreciate that. But it\u2019s just... I can\u2019t believe this, you know? Last year at this time, all I wanted was for Robert and me to get pregnant, and now...\u2019</p><p>She gulped, then moved a hand to cover her face, even as I heard whoever was on the other end start talking, their voice low and soothing. I pushed out my chair, then put my cup in the sink as once again, I found myself on the outside, watching something I\u2019d never really known and didn\u2019t understand. Most perplexing of all, though, was the tightness of my own throat and the sudden lump I felt there. I pushed back my chair, slipping out of the room, into the foyer, thinking again of my dad walking out that same door, bag in hand. It was terrible and awful when someone left you. You could move on, do the best you could, but like Eli had said, an ending was an ending. No matter how many pages of sentences and paragraphs of great stories led up to it, it would always have the last word.</p><p>By the time I left the house two hours later, Heidi and the baby were both sleeping. The house seemed almost peaceful, if you didn\u2019t know better.</p><p>I, however, felt entirely unsettled, which made no sense, because first, Heidi was not my mother, and second, when this had happened with my parents, years earlier, I\u2019d been just fine. Sure, I was disappointed and a little sad, but from what I remembered, I\u2019d adapted pretty quickly to the new arrangements. Aside from the whole not-sleeping thing, of course, but that had been going on already. What I didn\u2019t remember was the weird, panicky feeling, now still lingering, that had come over me watching my dad drive away from the house earlier. It was the way I usually felt around midnight, knowing that so much of the night was still to come and I had to find a way to fill it, the certainty of time passing so slowly until daylight.</p><p>Thank God I had work to do. I\u2019d actually never been so happy to walk into Clementine\u2019s, which was bustling with customers in a late afternoon rush. Maggie, consulting with a mother and daughter on some jean shorts, waved as I passed, grabbing the receipts and invoices on my way to the office. Once inside, I shut the door, flicked on the light, and prepared myself to buckle down into the numbers until closing. I\u2019d just managed to lose myself in the check register when my phone rang.</p><p>MOM, the caller ID said. I watched the screen, the little phone jumping up and down as it logged one ring, then another. For a moment, I considered answering and telling her everything. Then, just as quickly, I realized that this was the worst possible idea ever. It would be like Christmas and her birthday rolled into one, the satisfaction she\u2019d get, and I just couldn\u2019t take her smugness. And besides, she\u2019d hung up on me the day before, making it more than clear that she didn\u2019t want to know me. Now it was my right to distance myself, as long as I wanted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For the next two hours, I immersed myself in Heidi\u2019s books, more grateful than ever for the dependability and static nature of numbers and calculations. When I finished the register and the payroll, I turned my attention to the desk, which had been cluttered since the day I started. I could almost feel my blood pressure dropping, bit by bit, as I organized Heidi\u2019s pens, throwing out the ones that didn\u2019t work and making sure the rest had caps snugly on and were all facing upright in the pink mug where they lived. Then I moved on to the top drawer, sorting little scraps of paper, stacking random business cards into neat piles, and collecting all the paper clips into an empty Band-Aid box I found lying nearby. I was just about to tackle the next one, when there was a tap on the door and Maggie stuck her head in.</p><p>\u2018Hey,\u2019 she said. \u2018Esther\u2019s going to Beach Beans, you want anything?\u2019</p><p>I reached into my pocket, pulling out my wallet. \u2018Large triple-shot mocha.\u2019</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u2018Wow. You pulling an all-nighter, or something?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018No,\u2019 I said. \u2018I\u2019m just... kind of tired.\u2019</p><p>She nodded, running a hand through her hair. \u2018I hear you. My mom started in on me first thing this morning about my roommate forms. Apparently she wants me to fast track my pick because she\u2019s worried otherwise we won\u2019t have enough time to properly coordinate our linens. As if anyone else cares about that.\u2019</p><p>I had a flash of my own mother, her clipped tone when I dared to question her choice of the Pembleton Program. \u2018That\u2019s what she\u2019s worried about?\u2019</p><p>\u2018She\u2019s worried about everything,\u2019 Maggie said, flipping her hand. \u2018In her mind, if I don\u2019t have the perfect college experience, it will be an unparalleled tragedy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s not such a bad thing, though,\u2019 I said, \u2018is it?\u2019</p> <p>She sighed. \u2018You don\u2019t know my mother. I\u2019m never, you know, enough for her.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Enough?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Girly enough,\u2019 she explained, \u2018because I was so into dirt bikes. Social enough, because I only had one boyfriend all through high school and didn\u2019t \u201cplay the field\u201d. Now I\u2019m not embracing college enough. And it hasn\u2019t even started yet!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Tell me about it,\u2019 I said. \u2018My mom\u2019s riding me about the roommate thing, too. Except she wants me to enroll in some program where you do nothing but study twenty-four/seven and fun is not allowed under any circumstances.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Really?\u2019</p><p>I nodded.</p> <p>\u2018I should sign up for that. My mom would lose her mind.\u2019</p><p>I smiled. Then the front door chime sounded, and she looked down at the money in her hand. \u2018Large triple-shot mocha,\u2019 she said. I nodded. \u2018I\u2019ll let Esther know.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Thanks.\u2019</p><p>The door shut back with a click, and I pulled open the second desk drawer. Inside was a stack of old checkbook registers, topped with a couple of yellow legal pads, covered with scribbles. As I pulled them out, I glanced at the writing, which was clearly Heidi\u2019s. There were lists for inventory, various phone numbers, and a few pages in, this:</p><p>Caroline Isabel West</p><p>Isabel Caroline West</p><p>Emily Caroline West</p><p>Ainsley Isabel West</p> <p>Each was written carefully: you could almost feel her deliberation as she added them, one by one. I thought back to the day she\u2019d admitted her dislike of the name Thisbe, and how I \u2013 and my mother \u2013 had judged her for giving in to it anyway. My father was selfish. He got what he wanted, and even then, it wasn\u2019t enough.</p><p>I closed the pad, pushing it aside and digging down deeper into the drawer. There were various invoices, which I set aside to file properly, a flyer for the previous year\u2019s Annual Colby Beach Bash \u2013 Ahoy, Mateys! \u2013 and, at the very bottom, a stack of pictures. Here was Heidi, with a paintbrush dabbed with pink paint, standing with a wide smile in front of a white wall. Heidi again, posing before the front door, the CLEMENTINE\u2019S sign arcing over her head. And finally, at the very bottom, a shot of her with my dad. They were on the boardwalk, her in a white dress, her belly round and full, him with his arm around her. The date stamp was early May, just a few weeks before Isby was born.</p><p>\u2018Auden?\u2019</p><p>I jumped. Somehow Esther had managed to slip in the door right behind me. \u2018Oh,\u2019 I said, looking down at the drawer, the contents spread across the desk, \u2018I was just \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Your caffeine,\u2019 she said. She was holding out the cup to me when suddenly, something blurred past behind her. Something red, which then crashed against the end of the hallway with a loud, bouncy bang.</p><p>\u2018Hey!\u2019 Esther yelled out the door. \u2018What the hell was that?\u2019</p><p>\u2018What do you think?\u2019 I heard a male voice \u2013 Adam, I thought \u2013 yell back.</p><p>She opened the door wide, just as a red rubber ball rolled slowly past in the opposite direction, heading back toward the sales floor. \u2018Oh, man. Seriously?\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s right,\u2019 Adam hollered. \u2018Kickball. Tonight. Get ready to get wet.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And who,\u2019 I heard Maggie say, \u2018decided this?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Who do you think?\u2019</p><p>Esther stepped out into the hallway, picking up the ball. \u2018Not Eli.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yup.\u2019 I heard footsteps, and then Adam came into view, holding out his hands. Esther handed over the ball, and he nodded at me. \u2018Came in late today, with this under his arm. He actually seemed cheerful.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Really.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yup. We were all totally freaked out.\u2019 He gave the ball a bounce. \u2018But he was serious. First game of the season, tonight after closing. Drawing for second base commences sharply at ten oh five.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, God.\u2019 Maggie groaned, joining them in the hallway. \u2018If I have to be second base, I\u2019m not playing.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That,\u2019 Adam said, pointing at her, \u2018is a quitter attitude.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Last time I got totally soaked!\u2019 she protested.</p><p>\u2018Last time was over a year ago. Come on! Eli\u2019s finally pulling out of this thing. The least you can do is get a little wet.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It is pretty major that he\u2019s up for it,\u2019 Esther said to her. \u2018I wonder what changed.\u2019</p><p>I started to turn back to the desk, taking another sip of my drink. But not before I saw Maggie look right at me.</p><p>\u2018Who knows?\u2019 Adam said. \u2018Let\u2019s just be glad and get on with it. See you at ten!\u2019</p><p>And with that, he was gone, bouncing the ball as he went. Esther sighed, then followed him, but I could feel Maggie\u2019s eyes still on me as I carefully stacked everything back in the drawer, stuffing the pictures in on top. \u2018Hey,\u2019 she said. \u2018You all right?\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Yeah,\u2019 I said. \u2018I\u2019m fine.\u2019</p><p>This should have been true. After all, I\u2019d had the same night as Eli, and he\u2019d woken up with a whole new attitude. I should have been just coasting and happy, more ready than anyone to jump into kickball, especially with Eli there. And yet, as the nine o\u2019clock dance passed and the minutes of the next hour ticked down, I could feel my stomach getting tighter and tighter.</p><p>At ten on the nose, Maggie appeared in the doorway to the office, keys in her hand. \u2018Come on,\u2019 she announced. \u2018The second base drawing is in five minutes, and believe me, you don\u2019t want to get stuck with it. You\u2019re basically in the water.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh,\u2019 I said, \u2018actually, I think I\u2019m going to stay late tonight. I have this payroll to do, and some filing...\u2019</p> <p>She looked at me, then at the pens arranged neatly in the jar next to my elbow. \u2018Really.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah. I\u2019ll be along eventually.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Eventually,\u2019 she repeated. I nodded, then turned back to the desk. Her voice was flatter as she said, \u2018All right. We\u2019ll be waiting for you.\u2019</p><p>Finally she left, and I busied myself labeling some file folders as she and Esther shut down the registers and headed outside. Once the door was locked behind them, I pushed back from my desk. After fifteen minutes of just sitting there, I went out to the now dark store, walking up to the front windows.</p><p>Everyone was gathered just down the boardwalk, at the main entrance to the beach. I could see Maggie sitting on a bench next to Adam, with Esther beside him. Wallace and some other guys from the bike shop I knew by sight if not by name were milling around, joking with one another: I watched as they said something to Leah when she showed up, and she rolled her eyes, swatting at them before Maggie slid over to make room for her. More and more people came along, some I recognized, others I didn\u2019t. But then suddenly everyone began to move in closer, converging, and I knew Eli had arrived.</p> <p>He had on the same blue hoodie he was wearing the first time I saw him, the red ball tucked under one arm. His hair was loose, blowing over his eyes, and as he approached he bounced the ball once, catching it as he turned his head, scanning the assembled group. When he turned, looking behind him right at Clementine\u2019s, I stepped back from the window, out of sight.</p><p>After a moment of discussion, teams were organized, and some sort of decision was made. From the looks of it, Adam came out on the losing side, if the jeers and pointed fingers in his direction were any indication. Then, en masse, everyone headed onto the beach, with one group assembling by the dunes while another spread out across the sand. Adam, I saw, took his place right by the surf itself, reaching down to roll up his pant legs, while Eli moved to the center, the ball still in his hands. He was just rolling out the first pitch when I turned and went back to the office.</p><p>An hour later, I went out the back door, then made my way across a parking lot and down two alleys before finally popping out by the Gas/Gro. I\u2019d been planning to just go home, thinking Heidi might need the company, but instead I found myself walking back to the boardwalk. I sat down on a bench in front of the Last Chance, which was still bustling, to watch the game from a distance. Just as I arrived, Leah was up: she kicked the ball far and long, out into the water, and a guy I didn\u2019t recognize, now at second base, dove in after it.</p><p>\u2018Auden?\u2019</p><p>I jumped, then turned slowly, bracing myself. Of course Eli would sneak up on me, especially when I was doing my best to stay lost. But as I turned, I saw instead the last person I ever would have expected: my former almost-prom date, Jason Talbot. He was in khakis and a collared shirt, hands in his pockets, smiling at me.</p><p>\u2018Hey,\u2019 I said. \u2018What are you doing here?\u2019</p> <p>He nodded back at the restaurant behind him. \u2018Just finishing up some dinner. I\u2019ve been sitting in there for the last fifteen minutes, wondering if that was you, but I wasn\u2019t sure. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d seen your name on the list for the conference, but...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Conference?\u2019</p><p>\u2018The FCLC? It just started today. Isn\u2019t that why you\u2019re here?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Um,\u2019 I said. \u2018No. My dad lives nearby.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh. Right. Well... that\u2019s great.\u2019</p><p>There was a sudden burst of voices from down the boardwalk. We both looked over, just in time to see Maggie running the bases, laughing, while Adam started to wade out into the water. \u2018Wow,\u2019 Jason said. \u2018Kickball. Haven\u2019t seen that since third grade.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So what\u2019s the FCLC, again?\u2019 I asked.</p><p>\u2018Future College Leadership Course,\u2019 he replied. \u2018It\u2019s a month-long series of lectures, workshops, and symposiums, with incoming freshmen from schools all around the country. It\u2019s basically designed to give attendees skills they\u2019ll need to make an impact on their campuses from day one.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Wow,\u2019 I said. There was another round of cheering from behind him, but this time I didn\u2019t look. \u2018That sounds great.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, I think it will be. I\u2019ve already met, like, twenty people from Harvard who are already involved in campus leadership,\u2019 he said. \u2018You know, you should check it out. I know you weren\u2019t that into student government, but it\u2019s a great networking opportunity. It\u2019s not too late to sign up, and there are tons of people from Defriese there.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 I said. \u2018I\u2019m kind of busy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, tell me about it,\u2019 Jason replied, shaking his head. \u2018I got the syllabi from my fall classes and have been reading already, and it\u2019s really intense. But everyone I\u2019ve met is doing the same thing.\u2019</p><p>I nodded, even as I noted that my heart was already beating a bit faster. \u2018I bet,\u2019 I said.</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s really what I\u2019m hearing again and again. That you can\u2019t just come in on the first day of the semester and hit the ground running anymore.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Really.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, yeah. You need to prep early, and seriously.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve been doing my reading, too,\u2019 I said. \u2018I mean, between working and everything else...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Working?\u2019 I nodded. \u2018What are you doing? Like, internship stuff? Service projects?\u2019</p><p>I thought of the office at Clementine\u2019s, all that pink. \u2018More business-related. I\u2019m working for a small business that\u2019s in the process of expanding, helping with accounting and marketing during the transition. I figured it would be a good way to experience some real-time economics while at the same time studying the larger trends.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Wow,\u2019 he said, nodding. \u2018That sounds really interesting. Still, though, you should think about the FCLC. I mean, if you\u2019re here anyway. I think you\u2019d be a real asset to the conversation.\u2019</p><p>There was a loud whoop! noise from the beach, followed by a round of applause and laughter. I said, \u2018Maybe I will.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Good.\u2019 Jason smiled. \u2018Look, I should get back to dinner, I guess. We were in the middle of this big discussion about class rank, the pros and cons, and I don\u2019t want to miss it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sure,\u2019 I said. \u2018Of course.\u2019</p> <p>He took a step back, then paused. \u2018Are you at the same number, though? Because while I\u2019m here, maybe we could get together, you know. Just to catch up, compare notes.\u2019</p><p>Everyone was coming off the beach now. I could see Maggie and Adam, who was soaked, in front, with Leah and Esther following. \u2018Yeah,\u2019 I said. \u2018Sure.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Great!\u2019 He smiled again. \u2018So I\u2019ll just see you soon.\u2019</p><p>I nodded. And then, before I could even begin to react, he was stepping forward, pulling me into a hug. An awkward, too-much-elbow, faceful-of-fabric-softener hug, but at least it was over quickly.</p><p>But not quickly enough. Because as he walked away, there was Eli. Standing with the ball under his arm, watching me, his expression unreadable. For a moment, we just looked at each other, and I had a flash of that first long night, near this same place. Aren\u2019t they all.</p> <p>\u2018Hey,\u2019 I said. \u2018How was the game?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Good.\u2019 He bounced the ball once. \u2018We won.\u2019</p><p>Two couples, dressed for a night out, walked between us, chattering happily among themselves. For a fleeting instant, I just wanted to fall in with them, go wherever they were going.</p><p>\u2018So,\u2019 he said, coming closer, \u2018what happened?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I had to work,\u2019 I said. \u2018We\u2019re behind on payroll, and there was all this filing...\u2019</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019 He bounced the ball again. \u2018I mean to you.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Me?\u2019</p><p>He nodded. \u2018You\u2019re acting different. What\u2019s going on?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nothing,\u2019 I said. He kept his eyes on me, steady, unconvinced. \u2018What, you mean that?\u2019 I said, nodding at the Last Chance, where Jason had now disappeared inside. \u2018He\u2019s just this friend of mine from home. My prom date, actually, although he ditched me at the last minute. Not that I was that upset, we were never, like, serious. Anyway, he\u2019s down here for some conference, and he saw me out here, so \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Auden.\u2019 The way he said my name was like a brake, applied hard. I stopped in mid-breath. \u2018Seriously. What\u2019s wrong?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nothing,\u2019 I said again. \u2018Why do you keep asking me that?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Because you were fine last night,\u2019 he said. \u2018And then tonight you duck out and hide from me and now you won\u2019t even look me in the eye.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m fine,\u2019 I said. \u2018God, I just had to work. Why is that so hard to believe?\u2019</p><p>This time, he didn\u2019t answer. But he didn\u2019t really have to. It was a total lie, paper thin. And yet I stood there, holding on to it for dear life anyway.</p> <p>\u2018You know,\u2019 he said finally, \u2018if this is about what happened with your dad and Heidi...\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s not.\u2019 My voice was sharp. Defensive. Even I could hear it. \u2018I told you, I had to work. I have a lot on my plate right now, okay? I can\u2019t just spend my whole summer playing kickball. I have classes to prepare for, and books to read, if I want to hit the ground running at Defriese this fall. I\u2019ve been slacking off so much, and now...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Slacking off,\u2019 he repeated.</p><p>\u2018Yes.\u2019 I looked down at my hands. \u2018It\u2019s been fun and all. But I\u2019m totally behind. I have to get serious.\u2019</p><p>As I said this, down the boardwalk I could hear all those familiar voices, laughing, jeering, happy together. I knew it instantly, as the sound was much more familiar at a distance than from within it.</p><p>\u2018Right,\u2019 Eli said. \u2018Well. Good luck. Getting serious, and all that.\u2019</p><p>There was something in his tone \u2013 final, distant, exactly what I\u2019d thought I wanted \u2013 that made me suddenly realize maybe I didn\u2019t. \u2018Eli,\u2019 I said quickly. \u2018Look. I just...\u2019</p><p>But no words followed. I just let this hang there, open-ended, waiting for him to jump in, finish it, do the hard part for me. It was my dad\u2019s signature trick, and now I understood why. It was just so much easier than having to say what you didn\u2019t want to aloud. But Eli didn\u2019t fall in, doing the hard part for me. He just walked away. Not that this should have surprised me. What did he care if this sentence was finished or not? He was.</p><p>Chapter FOURTEEN</p><p>1:05 P.M.: Just on a break from a panel, thought you might want to grab lunch?</p><p>3:30 P.M.: Are you free for dinner tonight? Last Chance, around 6?</p><p>10:30 P.M.: Heading back to the dorms. Talk to you tomorrow.</p><p>I put my phone down on the desk. Leah, who was paging through some receipts, glanced at the screen. \u2018Well,\u2019 she said, \u2018someone\u2019s popular tonight.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s just this guy I know,\u2019 I told her. \u2018From home.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Just a guy,\u2019 she repeated. \u2018Is there even such a thing?\u2019</p><p>We were in the office after closing, where everyone was waiting for me to do a few last-minute things before locking up. \u2018In this case,\u2019 I told her, \u2018yes.\u2019</p><p>My phone beeped again. I sighed, turning it over.</p><p>10:45 P.M.: If you have time to chat tonight, give me a call. Got some ideas to run by you.</p><p>\u2018He seems awfully persistent,\u2019 Esther observed.</p><p>\u2018I think he\u2019s just trying to make up for standing me up at prom,\u2019 I said. \u2018Or something. I don\u2019t know.\u2019</p><p>Really, this hadn\u2019t occurred to me until right at that moment. But now that I thought about it, it kind of made sense.</p><p>\u2018You got stood up on prom night?\u2019 Maggie asked. She looked truly upset. \u2018That\u2019s horrible.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It wasn\u2019t quite that bad,\u2019 I said. \u2018He called the day before, said he\u2019d gotten invited to this big environmental meeting up in D.C. It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So is your senior prom,\u2019 Leah said. \u2018It\u2019s a good thing you\u2019re blowing him off. He deserves it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s not why I\u2019m...\u2019 I sighed. \u2018I\u2019m just not interested in revisiting that particular part of my past. That\u2019s all.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My phone beeped again. This time, I didn\u2019t even look at it. Later, though, back at home, I studied my phone, reading over Jason\u2019s messages again. Maybe it would be my own kind of do-over to answer back, go meet him, try again for something I didn\u2019t get before. But unlike bowling and food fights and breaking curfew, I didn\u2019t feel like I\u2019d missed out on Jason. Instead, what had happened \u2013 or not \u2013 with us was just a twist of fate, meant to be. Like we hadn\u2019t even needed a first chance, much less a second one.</p><p>A week earlier, at eleven thirty P.M., I would have been out already an hour, just starting the night\u2019s adventures. These days, though, I was usually back at home, in my room, hitting the books.</p><p>That night Eli had walked away from me, I\u2019d come home around midnight to find the entire house quiet. Isby was asleep in her room, and Heidi was down for the count, although she\u2019d left her bedside light on. I\u2019d gone to my own room, planning to just grab a few things before heading out, but then I\u2019d remembered what Jason had said about reading ahead and hitting the ground running. The next thing I knew, I was pulling my suitcase out from under my bed.</p><p>When I opened it up, the first thing I saw was the picture frame Hollis had given me, which I promptly pushed aside. Beneath it was my econ textbook. Within ten minutes, I was reading chapter one, a yellow pad half covered with notes beside me.</p> <p>It was so easy. Academics, like an old friend, had just waited patiently for me, and returning to it felt safe and right. Unlike all the things I\u2019d been doing with Eli, which were new and challenging and way out of my comfort zone, studying was my strength, the one thing I did well, no matter what else was going badly.</p><p>So instead of driving around that night, I stayed in my room, the window open beside me, reading chapter after chapter as the waves crashed below. Still, whenever I took a break to go get more coffee, or hit the bathroom, I\u2019d find myself glancing at my watch, wondering what Eli was up to. At midnight, probably the Washroom. By one thirty, Park Mart. And then, who knew? Without me and my stupid quest to deal with, he could have been anywhere.</p><p>Where I ended up, though, surprised me most of all. At seven A.M., I jerked awake, lifting my head off my legal pad, where it had apparently dropped when I actually fell asleep at some point the night before. My neck was aching, and I had ink stains on my cheek, but none of these felt as odd as the sensation that I had actually slept at night for the second time in a row. I wasn\u2019t really sure I wanted to know why.</p><p>Whatever the reason, this sudden change in sleeping habits \u2013 which continued over the next three nights \u2013 completely threw me off my schedule. For the first time in recent memory, I was awake and lucid in the morning. At first, I tried to just keep studying, but by day three, I decided to go to Clementine\u2019s.</p><p>\u2018Oh, my God,\u2019 I heard Maggie say as soon as I walked in. \u2018This is unbelievable.\u2019</p> <p>I rolled my eyes, then slid off my sunglasses, bracing myself for the inevitable questions, and required explanation, of what I was doing there so early. Then I realized that she hadn\u2019t seen me at all. Instead, she, Leah, and Adam were crowded around a laptop open on the counter, watching something on-screen.</p><p>\u2018Tell me about it,\u2019 Adam said. \u2018None of us had any idea. Not even Jake. He just got a text from someone saying they\u2019d seen it online, and so he looked it up.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s the date on it, again?\u2019 Leah asked as Maggie hit a button, leaning in closer.</p><p>\u2018Yesterday. It was the Hopper Bikes exhibition thing, in Randallton.\u2019</p><p>They all focused on the screen again, not seeming to notice me as I came closer, picking up the previous day\u2019s receipts. I glanced at the screen: there was a bike going up a ramp, then down the other side.</p><p>\u2018He looks good,\u2019 Maggie said.</p> <p>\u2018He looks great,\u2019 Adam told her. \u2018I mean, it was his first competition in over a year and he placed second.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Look at that,\u2019 Maggie murmured.</p><p>\u2018No kidding. It\u2019s serious vertical.\u2019 Adam shook his head. \u2018I can\u2019t believe Eli just got on the bike after all that time and did that well. It\u2019s crazy.\u2019</p><p>I looked at the screen again. The figure on the bike was small, but now I noticed the longer hair sticking out beneath the helmet.</p><p>\u2018Well,\u2019 Maggie said, \u2018maybe he didn\u2019t.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Meaning what?\u2019</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer at first. Then she said, \u2018Just because we didn\u2019t see him riding didn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah, but,\u2019 Adam said, \u2018to be that good, still, he\u2019d have to have been practicing a lot. Someone would have seen something. Unless he was, like...\u2019</p> <p>\u2018... doing it in the middle of the night or something,\u2019 Leah finished for him.</p><p>I glanced up. Both she and Maggie were looking at me, straight on. Adam, seeing this, looked at me, then back at them. \u2018Wait,\u2019 he said. \u2018What am I missing?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Did you know about this?\u2019 Leah asked. \u2018About Eli competing again?\u2019</p><p>I shook my head. \u2018No.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You sure about that?\u2019 Maggie said. \u2018You two seem to have a lot of secrets.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah,\u2019 I told her. \u2018I\u2019m positive.\u2019</p><p>They were all still watching me as I picked up my receipts, then went back into the office, shutting the door behind me. I listened as they watched the video again and again, commenting on how impressive Eli looked, how much he had surprised everyone. Especially me. It made me realize how lucky I\u2019d been to get the tiniest glimpse into what was in his head, like pushing a door open just enough for a sliver of light to fall through. At the same time, though, it made it clear how much still remained unexplored, unseen.</p><p>Aside from glimpsing the video, I didn\u2019t want to see Eli. In fact, I was so embarrassed about how I\u2019d acted and what I\u2019d said that I took great pains to avoid the bike shop whenever possible. I came and went from Clementine\u2019s by the back door most of the time, claiming that way got me home faster. I wasn\u2019t sure whether Maggie and everyone else believed me, and didn\u2019t really care either. In a couple of weeks, I\u2019d pack up for home, and then from there, Defriese. This part of my life, strange and transitory, was almost over. Thank God.</p><p>Later that night, when I took a study break, Heidi had pulled the rocking chair to the sliding glass doors, and had Isby swaddled and asleep in her arms, her phone at her ear.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 she was saying. \u2018Whenever we talk, he just sounds so defeated. Like he\u2019s convinced this won\u2019t work no matter what we do. I know, but...\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was quiet for a moment, and all I could hear was the rocking chair creaking, back and forth, back and forth.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m scared it\u2019s too late,\u2019 she said finally. \u2018Like he\u2019s right, and this is unfixable. I know, I know, you say it\u2019s never too late. But I\u2019m not so sure.\u2019</p><p>My phone, which was in my back pocket, suddenly beeped. I pulled it out, checking the screen.</p><p>You free for coffee? I\u2019m buying.</p> <p>I read these words once, twice, three times. Never too late, I thought. Then there was another beep.</p><p>Name the place, I\u2019m new here! J.</p><p>\u2018Who\u2019s texting you so late?\u2019 Heidi called out as she came back inside, carrying Isby, her phone in her free hand.</p><p>\u2018Just my ex prom date,\u2019 I told her. \u2018It\u2019s a long story.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Really,\u2019 she said. \u2018What... oh, my God!\u2019</p> <p>I jumped, startled, then looked behind me, expecting to see something crashing down or on fire. \u2018What?\u2019 I said. \u2018What is it?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Prom!\u2019 Heidi shook her head. \u2018I can\u2019t believe we didn\u2019t think of it earlier! For the Beach Bash theme. Prom Night. It\u2019s perfect!\u2019 She flipped open her phone, punching in a few numbers. A second later, I heard someone pick up. \u2018Prom,\u2019 she announced to them. There was a pause, then, \u2018For the theme!</p><p>Isn\u2019t it perfect? Well, think about it. People can dress up, and we can do a king and queen, and play cheesy music, and...\u2019</p><p>She kept talking, but I headed back upstairs to my room, where my books and notes were waiting. Once I settled onto the bed, though, I found I couldn\u2019t concentrate, so I sat back, breathing in some sea air. Then I saw my laptop on my bedside table. Before I could stop myself, I was booting it up and hitting LiveVid, the video site.</p><p>HOPPER BIKES EXHIBITION, I typed in. RANDALLTON. Ten videos popped up. After scrolling through them, I found one tagged STOCK and RAMP, and clicked on it.</p><p>It was the same one they\u2019d been watching at Clementine\u2019s: I recognized the helmet and the background. I remembered what I\u2019d seen at the jump park, and even to my untrained eye what Eli was doing was different. There was a grace to it, an effortlessness, that made it clear how hard it really had to be. As he moved across the screen, each time going higher, higher in the air, I felt my heart jump. It was so risky and so scary, and yet at the same time, so beautiful. Maybe the truth was, it shouldn\u2019t be easy to be amazing. Then everything would be. It\u2019s the things you fight for and struggle with before earning that have the greatest worth. When something\u2019s difficult to come by, you\u2019ll do that much more to make sure it\u2019s even harder \u2013 if not impossible \u2013 to lose.</p> <p>The next morning, after about a week of awkward phone calls, I finally went to visit my dad at the Condor. I found him in his room with the shades drawn, sporting a desert island\u2013style beard. After opening the door for me, he flopped onto the unmade bed, stretching his arms over his head and closing his eyes.</p><p>\u2018So,\u2019 he said, after emitting a long, loud sigh, \u2018tell me. How is my life without me?\u2019</p><p>Simultaneously, I resisted the urge to answer this question and to roll my eyes. Instead, I said, \u2018Haven\u2019t you and Heidi talked?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Talk.\u2019 He scoffed, flipping a wrist. \u2018Oh, we talk. But nothing ever really gets said. The bottom line is, we don\u2019t see eye to eye. I worry we never will.\u2019</p><p>The truth was, I didn\u2019t really want to know all the sticky details of their problems. It was enough to know they had them, and that they were Big and Unresolved. But since I was the only one there, I felt I had no choice but to wade in deeper. \u2018Is this... is it about the baby?\u2019</p><p>He sat up slightly and looked at me. \u2018Oh, Auden. Is that what she\u2019s saying?\u2019</p><p>\u2018She isn\u2019t saying anything,\u2019 I told him, pulling open the heavy shades. \u2018I\u2019m just asking because I want you guys to work it out, that\u2019s all.\u2019</p><p>He watched me, studious, as I walked around his room, picking up coffee cups and fast-food bags. \u2018Your concern is intriguing,\u2019 he said finally. \u2018Considering I thought you didn\u2019t like Heidi.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018What?\u2019 I threw a couple of sticky, ketchup-covered napkins in the overflowing trash can. \u2018Of course I do.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So you don\u2019t think she\u2019s some vapid, soulless Barbie doll?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 I said, pushing aside the thought that, okay, this might have once been true. \u2018Why would you think that?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Because that\u2019s what your mother said,\u2019 he replied, his voice heavy. \u2018And you two tend to think alike.\u2019</p><p>I was in the bathroom as he said this, washing my hands, and hearing it I looked up, then away from my own eyes in the mirror. Maybe this had once been true, as well. \u2018Not about everything,\u2019 I said.</p><p>\u2018Oh, but that is what is great about your mother,\u2019 he mused as I looked around for a clean towel to wipe my hands on. \u2018You always know what she\u2019s thinking. There\u2019s none of this guessing around, speculating, having to read all the hidden signs and codes. When she was unhappy, I knew it. But Heidi...\u2019</p><p>I stepped back into the room, sitting down on the other bed. \u2018Heidi what?\u2019</p><p>He sighed again. \u2018She hides everything. Keeps it deep down, and you think everything\u2019s fine, but then one day, out of nowhere, it suddenly explodes in your face. She\u2019s not fine, she\u2019s unhappy. You haven\u2019t been doing enough after all. Oh, and you\u2019re the worst father ever, also.\u2019</p><p>I waited a beat or two before asking, \u2018Did she actually say that, though?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Of course not!\u2019 he snapped. \u2018But in marriage, all is subtext, Auden. The fact of the matter is that in her mind, I have failed her and Thisbe. From day one, apparently.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So you try again,\u2019 I said. \u2018And do better.\u2019</p><p>He gave me a sad look. \u2018It\u2019s not that easy, honey.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s the alternative, though? Just staying here, alone?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, I don\u2019t know.\u2019 He got off the bed, walking over to the window and sliding his hands in his pockets. \u2018I certainly don\u2019t want to make things any worse than I already have. It\u2019s possible they\u2019d be better off without me. Even probable.\u2019</p><p>I felt my stomach twist, unexpectedly. \u2018I doubt that,\u2019 I said. \u2018Heidi loves you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And I her,\u2019 he said. \u2018But sometimes, love isn\u2019t enough.\u2019 The weird thing was that what bothered me most about him saying this was that it was such a lame, throwaway line. He was a great writer: I knew he could do better. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018I\u2019ve got to go to work,\u2019 I said, picking up my bag from the bed beside me. \u2018I just... I wanted to see how you were.\u2019</p><p>He walked over to me, pulling me close for a hug. I could feel that beard, itchy and out of place, rubbing my forehead as he murmured, \u2018I\u2019m okay. I\u2019ll be okay.\u2019</p><p>Outside, I walked to the elevator and hit the button, which did not light up. I hit it again. Nothing. Then I stepped closer, and bashed it with my fist.</p><p>I realized \u2013 as it finally lit up, and fast \u2013 that I was furious. No: heart-pounding, can\u2019t-even-think-straight pissed off. When I got inside the elevator, the doors closed, mirroring my reflection back at me. This time, I looked at myself full-on.</p> <p>It was the strangest thing, to be suddenly infuriated, like something he\u2019d said, or done, had uncapped a valve within me, long sealed, and suddenly something was shooting out, gushing like a geyser. As I crossed the lobby to the boardwalk, all I could think was that regardless of the performance I\u2019d just witnessed, it didn\u2019t make you noble to step away from something that wasn\u2019t working, even if you thought you were the reason for the malfunction. Especially then. It just made you a quitter. Because if you were the problem, chances were you could also be the solution. The only way to find out was to take another shot.</p><p>I was almost to Clementine\u2019s before I realized how fast I was walking, passing people on both sides. When I finally pushed the door open, I was breathing so heavily and so flushed that Maggie jumped, startled, when she saw me.</p><p>\u2018Auden?\u2019 she said. \u2018What\u2019s \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018I need a favor,\u2019 I told her.</p><p>She blinked at me. \u2018Okay,\u2019 she said. \u2018What is it?\u2019</p> <p>When I told her, I expected her to be confused. Or maybe laugh at me. But she did neither. She just considered it for a moment, and then nodded. \u2018Yeah,\u2019 she said. \u2018I can do that.\u2019</p><p>Chapter FIFTEEN</p><p>It was, to say the least, embarrassing.</p><p>\u2018Now, see,\u2019 Maggie said as I got up off the ground, \u2018that\u2019s what we don\u2019t want to happen.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Got it.\u2019 I looked down, noting my newly scraped knee, which now matched my other one. \u2018I just... it feels so weird.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I bet.\u2019 She sighed. \u2018I mean, there\u2019s a reason you\u2019re supposed to learn this when you\u2019re little.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Less self-conscious?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Less distance to fall.\u2019</p><p>She reached down, picking up the bike and putting it back into a standing position. Once more, I climbed on, resting my feet flat on the ground. \u2018Okay,\u2019 she said. \u2018Try again.\u2019</p><p>We were at the clearing by the jump park, bright and early the following morning, and one thing was now clear: I did not know how to ride a bike.</p><p>If I had, it would have come back to me, along with the confidence that I did know what to do once I was up on the pedals and rolling forward. Instead, each time I got moving \u2013 even at a snail\u2019s pace \u2013 I panicked, wobbled, and fell. I\u2019d managed to go about forty yards once, but only because Maggie was holding on to the back of the seat. As soon as she let go, I veered off into some bushes and wiped out once more.</p><p>Of course I wanted to quit. I had since the first wreck, which had been over an hour earlier. It was completely humiliating to have to keep picking myself up off the ground and wiping sand and gravel off my knees, not to mention facing Maggie\u2019s cheerful, go-team expression, which was usually paired with a thumbs-up, even after I\u2019d gone down hard. This was just such a simple thing. Little kids did it every day. And yet, I kept failing. And falling.</p><p>\u2018You know,\u2019 she said, after the next crash, which involved full-body contact with a garbage can, yuck, \u2018I\u2019m thinking I\u2019m approaching this the wrong way.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s not you,\u2019 I told her, picking up the bike again. \u2018It\u2019s me. I\u2019m terrible at this.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018No, you\u2019re not.\u2019 She smiled at me, which made me feel even more pathetic. \u2018Look, riding a bike involves a great deal of faith. I mean, you\u2019re not supposed to be able to be aloft on two skinny rubber tires. It goes against all logic.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Okay,\u2019 I said, picking some gravel off my elbow, \u2018now you\u2019re really being condescending.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not.\u2019 She held the bike as I climbed back on and flexed my hands over the bars. \u2018But I do think that maybe we could use some reinforcements.\u2019</p><p>I looked at her. \u2018Oh, no. No way.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Auden. It\u2019s all right.\u2019 She pulled her phone out of her back pocket, flipping it open.</p><p>\u2018Please don\u2019t,\u2019 I said. \u2018Leah will laugh me out of town. And Esther... she\u2019ll just feel sorry for me, which would be even worse.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Agreed,\u2019 she replied, punching some keys. \u2018But I\u2019m calling the one person you literally cannot make an ass of yourself in front of. It\u2019s guaranteed.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Maggie.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Seriously.\u2019 She hit another button. \u2018Trust me.\u2019</p><p>At the time, I had no idea who she was talking about. But ten minutes later, when I heard a car door slam in the parking lot behind us and turned my head, it made total sense.</p><p>\u2018This is a 911?\u2019 Adam said as he walked up. \u2018You know you only text that when someone is dead or dying. You scared the crap out of me!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sorry,\u2019 Maggie told him. \u2018But I needed you here fast.\u2019</p><p>He sighed, then pulled a hand through his curly hair, which, I now noticed, was sticking up on one side. Also, there were sheet crease marks on his face. \u2018Fine. So what\u2019s the emergency?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well,\u2019 she said, \u2018Auden can\u2019t ride a bike.\u2019</p><p>Adam looked at me, and I felt myself flush. \u2018Wow,\u2019 he said solemnly. \u2018That is serious.\u2019</p><p>\u2018See?\u2019 Maggie said to me. \u2018I told you he was the right person to call!\u2019</p><p>Adam came closer, checking out both the bike and me on it. \u2018All right,\u2019 he said after a moment. \u2018So what method of instruction have you been using here?\u2019</p><p>Maggie blinked. \u2018Method of...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Did you start with the buddy system, and then move on to assisted riding? Or do assisted riding first, with the intention of a slow, incremental build toward independent movement?\u2019</p><p>Maggie and I exchanged a look. Then she said, \u2018I just kind of put her on and let her go.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, man. That\u2019s the fastest way to make a person hate the bike.\u2019 He gestured for me to get off and roll it toward him, which I did. Then he climbed on. \u2018Okay, Auden. Get on the handlebars.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018What?\u2019</p><p>\u2018The handlebars. Climb on.\u2019 When I just stood there, clearly doubtful, he said, \u2018Look. If you want to learn to ride a bike, you have to want to learn to ride a bike. And the only way to do that is to see how fun it is, once you know what you\u2019re doing. Hop on.\u2019</p><p>I shot a look at Maggie. When she nodded encouragingly, I eased myself up on the handlebars, trying to be graceful about it. \u2018Okay,\u2019 Adam said. \u2018Now hold on tight. When we get going really fast, you can let go, but only for a second, and only when you really feel ready.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not letting go,\u2019 I told him. \u2018Ever.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018That\u2019s fine, too.\u2019</p><p>Then he started pedaling. Slowly at first, and then a bit faster, so that the wind was blowing back my hair and ruffling my shirt. Once we reached the end of the parking lot, he hung a right and kept going.</p><p>\u2018Wait,\u2019 I said, looking back at Maggie, who was watching us, her hand shielding her eyes. \u2018What about...\u2019</p><p>\u2018She\u2019s fine,\u2019 Adam said. \u2018We won\u2019t be gone long.\u2019</p><p>We were on the main road now, moving swiftly along the shoulder, the occasional car passing us on the left. The sun was fully up now, and the air smelled sweet and salty, all at once. \u2018Okay,\u2019 Adam yelled as another car passed us, \u2018tell me what you\u2019re feeling.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I\u2019m hoping I don\u2019t fall off the handlebars,\u2019 I told him. \u2018What else?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I...\u2019 I said as we bumped off the road, onto the boardwalk, \u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You have to be feeling something.\u2019</p><p>I considered this as we started down the boardwalk, which was mostly empty, save for a few early morning walkers and a bunch of seagulls, which scattered as we approached. \u2018It\u2019s like flying,\u2019 I said, watching them rise up. \u2018Kind of.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Exactly!\u2019 he said, picking up the pace a bit. \u2018The speed, the wind... and the best part is, it\u2019s all you doing it. I mean, it\u2019s me, now. But it will be you. And it will feel just like this. Or even better, actually, because it will be you doing it, all on your own.\u2019</p><p>We were really going now, the boards clacking beneath us, and I leaned back farther, letting the wind hit my face straight on. To my right, the ocean was so big and sparkling, and, as we whooshed along, it was a steady blue, blurring past. Despite my worry about falling, and my various embarrassments, I felt a strange sense of exhilaration, and I closed my eyes.</p> <p>\u2018See?\u2019 Adam said, his voice somehow finding my ears. \u2018This is a good thing.\u2019</p><p>I opened my eyes, intending to respond to this. To tell him he was right, that I understood now, and how grateful I was that he\u2019d given me this chance, and this ride. But just as my vision cleared, I realized we were passing the bike shop, and turned my head, looking at it. The front door was open, and in the second we blew by it I could see the back lights were on and someone was standing at the counter. Someone holding a plastic coffee cup. Maybe we were going so fast that Eli didn\u2019t even see, or if he did, had no way of knowing it was me. But regardless, for one instant, I decided to let go for real, and held up my hands anyway.</p><p>For the next week, Maggie and I practiced almost every morning. It was a ritual: I picked up two coffees at Beach Beans, then met her at the jump park clearing. At first, on Adam\u2019s advice, we incorporated what he called \u2018assisted riding\u2019, i.e., me pedaling with her holding on to the back of the seat. Then we worked up to her letting go for small increments, while still running behind, so I didn\u2019t topple over. Now, we were increasing those periods, bit by bit, while I continued to work on my balance and pedaling. It wasn\u2019t perfect \u2013 I\u2019d had a couple of wipeouts, and still sported scabs on both knees \u2013 but it was much better than that first day.</p><p>More and more lately, I\u2019d been realizing that my life had again shifted, almost reversing itself. I now stayed home at night, studying and sleeping, and was out in the early morning and afternoon, almost like a normal person. Unlike a normal person, though, I was still spending most of my time alone. If I wasn\u2019t at work or practicing with Maggie, I was at home, avoiding texts from Jason \u2013 which were still coming, although not with such regularity, thank God \u2013 and phone calls from my parents.</p><p>I knew they both had to be wondering what was going on, as I hadn\u2019t talked to either of them in ages, ignoring their calls and subsequent messages. I knew this was childish, and for some reason this actually made it okay to me. Like it was another part of my unfinished quest, making up for lost time. Really, though, some part of me was worried that if I did speak to either of them \u2013 even for a moment, one word \u2013 whatever I\u2019d barely tapped into that day leaving the Condor would spill out like a big wave, engulfing us all.</p><p>The only family member I was talking to was Hollis, but even our contact was sporadic at best, if only because he was so caught up in his new life with Laura. If my dad\u2019s relationship was falling apart, and my mom\u2019s, as usual, never really even starting, Hollis was still bucking convention and his own history. Weird enough that he was still madly in love, long after he usually had lost interest and moved on. Now, he\u2019d done something else shocking.</p><p>\u2018Hollis West.\u2019</p><p>Even though I had dialed his number and so knew this was my brother, I was still taken aback by his professional tone. \u2018Hollis?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Aud! Hey! Hold on, let me just step outside.\u2019</p><p>There were some muffled noises, followed by the sound of a door shutting. Then he was back. \u2018Sorry about that,\u2019 he said. \u2018We\u2019re just on a break from this meeting.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You and Laura?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No. Me and the rest of the personal finance specialists.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Who?\u2019</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u2018My coworkers. I\u2019m at Main Mutual now, didn\u2019t Mom tell you?\u2019</p><p>Vaguely, I remembered my mother saying something about a bank. \u2018I guess,\u2019 I said. \u2018How long have you been there?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Three weeks or so,\u2019 he said. \u2018It\u2019s gone fast, though. I\u2019m really clicking here.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So,\u2019 I said slowly, \u2018you like it?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Totally!\u2019 I heard a horn beep. \u2018Turns out I\u2019m really good at customer relations. I guess all that bullshitting around Europe did train me for something after all.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You relate to customers?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Apparently.\u2019 He laughed. \u2018I got hired on as a teller, but after a week they moved me to the customer service desk. So I handle all the account changes, and safety-deposit applications, stuff like that.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I was trying to picture Hollis behind a desk at a bank, or anywhere. But all I could see was that shot of him grinning in his backpack in front of the Taj Mahal. This was the best of times?</p><p>\u2018So, Aud,\u2019 he said. \u2018I\u2019ve only got a few minutes before I go back in. What\u2019s up down there? How\u2019s Dad and Heidi and my other sister?\u2019</p><p>I hesitated, knowing I should tell him about my father moving out. He had a right to know. But for some reason, I didn\u2019t want to be the one to tell him. It was like my dad trailing off another sentence, leaving me to do his dirty work. So instead I said, \u2018Everything\u2019s all right. How\u2019s Mom?\u2019</p><p>He sighed. \u2018Oh, you know. Crabby as always. Apparently I have disappointed her beyond belief by turning my back on my independent spirit and joining the bourgeoisie.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I bet.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And she misses you.\u2019</p><p>Honestly, hearing this shocked me almost as much as hearing his new job title. \u2018Mom doesn\u2019t miss anyone,\u2019 I said. \u2018She\u2019s completely self-sustaining.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Not true.\u2019 He paused for a second. \u2018Look, Aud. I know you guys have had your issues this summer, but you should really try to talk to her. She\u2019s still having all this drama with Finn, and...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Finn?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018The graduate student. Car sleeper? I told you about him, right?\u2019</p><p>I thought of those black-framed glasses. \u2018Yeah. I think so.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You know the drill. He\u2019s in love with her, she won\u2019t commit, blah blah blah. Usually they scare off easy, but this one, he\u2019s tenacious. He is not giving up. It\u2019s kicking up all her issues.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Wow,\u2019 I said. \u2018Sounds intense.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Everything is, where she\u2019s concerned,\u2019 he replied. \u2018Look, Aud, I gotta get back inside for this brainstorming session. But seriously. Give her another shot.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hollis. I don\u2019t...\u2019</p> <p>\u2018At least consider it, then. For me?\u2019</p><p>I didn\u2019t feel like I owed Hollis all that much, to be honest. So I suppose it said something about his people skills that I still heard myself say, \u2018All right. I\u2019ll think about it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Thank you. And hey, call me later, all right? I want to hear what else is going on.\u2019</p><p>I assured him that I would, and then he was gone, back into his meeting. And I kept my word, and did think about talking to my mom. I decided against it. But I did consider it.</p><p>Then it was back to the same old, same old. I tried to steer clear of Heidi, who had thrown herself full throttle into planning the Beach Bash. Ignored my parents\u2019 messages. Read another chapter, did another set of study questions. Turned off the light when I felt my eyes get heavy and then lay there in the dark, never believing that sleep would come until the exact moment when it did. The only time I let my mind go to anything other than school and work, actually, was when I was on the bike. And then, I thought only of Eli.</p><p>Since that day we\u2019d blown past him on the boardwalk, I\u2019d seen him a handful of times. He was passing by the front windows of Clementine\u2019s as I took stuff out of the register, or standing in front of the shop, showing a bike to a prospective customer. It was easy to tell myself that we were only not talking because we were so busy with other things, and I could almost believe that. But then I\u2019d remember what I\u2019d said to him about slacking off, and the look on his face just before he\u2019d walked away from me, and I knew otherwise. This was my choice, my decision. He was the closest thing I\u2019d ever had to something, or someone, that mattered. But in the end, close didn\u2019t count. You were either in, or you weren\u2019t.</p><p>What I thought about most, though, when I was on the bike, was my quest. At the time, it had seemed like a silly little game, something to pass the time, but now, I was understanding it was so much more than that. Night after night, task after task, he\u2019d helped me to return to my past and make some things \u2013 if not everything \u2013 right. Eli had given me all these second chances, presented like a gift. In the end, though, I was one short. Still, as I pedaled around the jump park lot, Maggie either holding on or right behind me, I wished I could just show him this one thing. I knew it wouldn\u2019t make up for everything else. But for some reason, I wanted him to know anyway.</p><p>So in the mornings, I practiced my riding, slowly gaining speed and confidence. At night, I sat in front of my laptop, searching for clips on LiveVid of him in one competition after another. Watching him move across the screen, so quick and sure, it hardly seemed like they could be related, my fledgling efforts and his complete skill and mastery. But at their core, they were the same thing. Each was about propelling yourself forward, into whatever lies ahead, one turn of the wheel at a time.</p> <p>First, there was squealing. Then, giggling. But it wasn\u2019t until I heard the music start up that I put down my pen and went to investigate.</p><p>It was ten fifteen, and I was doing what I always did in the evenings, these days: getting ready to do some school-work. After finishing up the books at Clementine\u2019s, I\u2019d grabbed a sandwich from Beach Beans, which I ate alone in the kitchen, savoring the fact that I had the house to myself. Once I was settled and ten minutes into World Economic Theory and Practices, though, I suddenly had company. The loud kind.</p><p>I went halfway down the stairs, then peered into the kitchen to see a crowd. Heidi, in shorts and a black tank top, was piling plastic bags on the kitchen table as Isby, strapped in her stroller, watched. A blonde Heidi\u2019s age was popping a beer as another girl, a brunette, dumped some tortilla chips into a bowl. Maggie, Leah, and Esther were all seated around the table, more plastic bags piled up in front of them.</p><p>There\u2019s a certain sound that can only be made by a group of women. It\u2019s not just chatter, or even conversation, but almost a melody of words and exhalations. I\u2019d spent a lot of my life listening to it from just this kind of distance, but still, it never failed to make me acutely aware of every bit of the space between me and its source. At the same time, though, this was where I preferred to be, which was why it was so unsettling when Heidi looked up and spotted me.</p><p>\u2018Auden,\u2019 she called out as someone turned up the music, which sounded like salsa, fast with a lot of horns. \u2018Hey. Come join us!\u2019</p><p>Before I could react, everyone had turned and looked at me, making a fast retreat not just awkward but impossible. \u2018Um,\u2019 I said. \u2018I \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018This is Isabel,\u2019 she continued, pointing at the blonde, who nodded at me. Then she gestured to the brunette. \u2018And this is Morgan. My oldest friends in Colby. Guys, this is Auden, Robert\u2019s daughter.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018So nice to finally meet you!\u2019 Morgan said. \u2018Heidi just raves about you. Raves!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Did you get my messages?\u2019 Heidi asked as she lifted Isby out of her stroller. \u2018I tried to let you know we were coming, but your mailbox was full.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Wow,\u2019 Leah said, raising her eyebrows. \u2018Someone\u2019s popular.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Actually,\u2019 I said as Esther upended a bag onto the table, spilling out a pile of little picture frames, \u2018I\u2019m making a bunch of calls right now.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Oh. Well, when you\u2019re done, then.\u2019 Heidi reached over, taking the beer that Isabel was offering her as Morgan put the chips on the table. \u2018We\u2019ll be here, I\u2019m sure. We\u2019ve got at least three hundred favors to make.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Three hundred?\u2019 Leah said. She narrowed her eyes at Maggie. \u2018You said...\u2019</p><p>\u2018I said it would be fun, and it will be,\u2019 Maggie replied. \u2018What else were you going to do tonight, anyway?\u2019</p><p>\u2018A lot of things! It\u2019s Ladies\u2019 Night at Tallyho.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, no, no to Tallyho,\u2019 Esther said, picking up a picture frame.</p> <p>\u2018Amen to that,\u2019 Isabel agreed. \u2018That place gives me the skeevies.\u2019</p><p>Back in my room, I picked up my pen again and tried to immerse myself in the politics of global currency. After a few bursts of laughter from downstairs, I got up and shut the door. I could still hear the music through the floor, though, the beat insistent and distracting. Finally, I picked up my phone, flipping it open and dialing into my mailbox.</p><p>Heidi was right: it was full, mostly with old messages from my parents I\u2019d never gotten around to really listening to. I worked my way through them, one by one, my eyes on the dark ocean outside.</p><p>\u2018Auden, hello, it\u2019s your mother. I\u2019ll try you again later, I suppose.\u2019</p><p>Delete.</p><p>\u2018Hi, honey, it\u2019s your dad. Just taking a break from doing some revisions, thought I\u2019d give you a call. I\u2019ll be here in the room all day if you want to call or drop by. I\u2019ll keep an eye out for you.\u2019</p> <p>Delete.</p><p>\u2018Auden, this is your mother. Your brother is now working at a bank. I hope you are adequately horrified. Goodbye.\u2019</p><p>Delete.</p><p>\u2018Hi, Auden, Dad here again. Wondering if you might want to meet at the Last Chance, I\u2019m getting a little sick of room service. Give me a call, okay?\u2019</p><p>Delete.</p><p>\u2018Auden. I am getting tired of your voice mail. I will not be calling again until I hear from you.\u2019</p><p>Delete.</p><p>\u2018Honey, Dad again. I guess I\u2019ll call the house number, maybe you\u2019re not answering this one anymore?\u2019</p> <p>Delete.</p><p>They just went on and on, endlessly, and yet I felt nothing as I kept hitting the same button, erasing them. Until I got to this one.</p><p>\u2018Oh, Auden. You are clearly avoiding me.\u2019 There was a sigh, as familiar to me as my own face. Then, though, she said, \u2018I suppose this is what I deserve? As always, I seem to be especially adept at alienating the few people I actually want to talk to. I don\u2019t know why that is. Maybe you\u2019ve figured it out, in your summer of transformation? I wonder...\u2019</p><p>I pulled the phone away, looking down at it. This message was from two days ago, at around five P.M. Where had I been, when she\u2019d left it? Probably alone as well, in the office at Clementine\u2019s, here in my room, or somewhere in between.</p><p>I thought of my mother, sitting at her kitchen table, with Hollis off working at a bank, and me, for all she knew, riding in a car with boys while wearing a pink bikini. How different we had to be from what she had expected, or planned, all those days when, like Heidi, she rocked us and carried us and cared for us. It was so easy to disown what you couldn\u2019t recognize, to keep yourself apart from things that were foreign and unsettling. The only person you can be sure to control, always, is yourself. Which is a lot to be sure of, but at the same time, not enough.</p><p>Now, as there was another round of laughter from downstairs, I hit number one on my speed dial, and waited.</p><p>\u2018Hello?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Mom, it\u2019s me.\u2019</p><p>A pause. Then, \u2018Auden. How are you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m okay,\u2019 I said. It felt strange, talking to her after all this time. \u2018How are you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well,\u2019 she said. \u2018I suppose I am okay, also.\u2019</p><p>My mother was not the touchy-feely type. Never had been. But there was something in her voice, in that message, that gave me the courage to say what I did next.</p><p>\u2018Mom? Can I ask you something?\u2019</p><p>I could hear her hesitate before she said, \u2018Yes. Of course.\u2019</p><p>\u2018When you and Dad decided to split up, was that... did you do it right away? Or did you, like, try and work it out for a long time first?\u2019</p><p>I don\u2019t know what she\u2019d been expecting me to ask. But based on the long silence that followed, it wasn\u2019t this. Finally she said, \u2018We tried very hard to stay together. The divorce was not a decision we made lightly, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking. Is that what you\u2019re asking?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019 I looked down at my book, my pad lined up beside it. \u2018I guess... forget it. I\u2019m sorry.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, no, it\u2019s all right.\u2019 Her voice was closer to the phone now, filling my ear. \u2018Auden, what\u2019s going on? Why are you thinking about this now?\u2019</p><p>I was embarrassed, suddenly, to realize that I had a lump in my throat. God, what was wrong with me? I swallowed, then said, \u2018It\u2019s just... Dad and Heidi are having problems.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Problems,\u2019 she repeated. \u2018What kind of problems?\u2019</p><p>From downstairs, I heard another round of laughter. I said, \u2018He moved out a couple of weeks ago.\u2019</p><p>She exhaled slowly, the kind of sound someone makes as they watch a baseball fly over a fence, way, way gone. \u2018Oh, my. I\u2019m sorry to hear that.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Are you?\u2019</p><p>I said this without really realizing it, and instantly regretted how surprised I sounded. Her tone was a bit sharper as she said, \u2018Well, of course. One never likes to see a marriage in trouble, especially when a child is involved.\u2019</p><p>And just like that, I was crying. The tears just came, filling my eyes and spilling over, and I sucked in a breath in an attempt to maintain my composure.</p><p>\u2018Auden? Are you all right?\u2019</p><p>I looked out my window at the ocean again, so steady and vast, seemingly never changing and yet always in flux. \u2018I guess I just wish,\u2019 I said, my voice wavering, \u2018that I\u2019d done some things differently.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Ah,\u2019 she said. Like she understood totally, even with so little given. Subtext, indeed. \u2018Don\u2019t we all.\u2019</p><p>Maybe with normal mothers and daughters, it was more straightforward. They had the kind of back-and-forth that left no ambiguity or question, saying exactly what they meant, when they meant it. But my mom and I weren\u2019t normal, so this \u2013 stilted and vague as it might be \u2013 was the closest we\u2019d come to each other in ages. It was like reaching out for someone\u2019s hand, then missing their fingers, or even their arm, and hitting their shoulder instead. But no matter. You hang on tight anyway.</p><p>For a moment, we just sat there on the line, neither of us saying anything. Finally I said, \u2018I should go. My friends are downstairs.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Of course.\u2019 She coughed. \u2018Call me tomorrow, though?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Yes. Absolutely.\u2019</p><p>\u2018All right. Good night, Auden.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Good night.\u2019</p><p>I closed my phone, then put it on the bed, on top of my textbook, and walked over to the door. As I went down the hallway and then the stairs, I could hear that same familiar melody, playing louder than ever.</p><p>\u2018... just don\u2019t understand why suddenly we\u2019re all acting like prom night was so great,\u2019 Isabel was saying.</p> <p>\u2018Because it was,\u2019 Morgan replied.</p><p>\u2018For some of you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Exactly,\u2019 Esther said. \u2018Some of us got stuck with drunk dates who never made it out of the parking lot.\u2019</p><p>Morgan snorted. Isabel said, \u2018Shut up.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Personally,\u2019 Heidi was saying, \u2018I think prom is one of those high school things that you either really loved or really hated. Like high school itself.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I loved high school,\u2019 Maggie said.</p> <p>\u2018Of course you did,\u2019 Leah told her. \u2018You dated the hottest guy, you had the best grades, and everyone loved you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You never wanted everyone to love you,\u2019 Esther said to Leah.</p><p>\u2018I wouldn\u2019t have minded if somebody did, though,\u2019 she replied.</p><p>\u2018My high school boyfriend broke my heart, remember,\u2019 Maggie told her.</p><p>\u2018Mine, too!\u2019 Morgan sighed. \u2018God, that sucked.\u2019</p><p>\u2018He was a tool,\u2019 Isabel told her. \u2018Way too much hair gel.\u2019</p><p>Now Esther snorted. Leah said, \u2018Shut up.\u2019</p><p>\u2018See, though,\u2019 Heidi said, \u2018this is why this is such a good theme! People who loved prom can relive the experience. People who hated it get another shot. Everyone wins.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Except the losers stuck doing three hundred favors,\u2019 Leah grumbled. Then she looked up and saw me. \u2018Hey. You decide to come be a loser, too?\u2019</p><p>I swallowed, aware of Heidi looking at me, noticing my red eyes, her expression suddenly concerned. \u2018You bet,\u2019 I said.</p><p>Maggie scooted over in her chair, making a space for me, and I sat down beside her. \u2018So,\u2019 Isabel said. \u2018Auden. Prom love or prom hate?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Prom hate,\u2019 I replied. \u2018I got stood up.\u2019</p><p>There was a round of gasps. \u2018You what?\u2019 Morgan said. \u2018That\u2019s terrible!\u2019</p><p>\u2018And,\u2019 Leah added, \u2018the guy is down here now and won\u2019t stop texting her.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You know what you should do,\u2019 Morgan said. \u2018You should ask him to the Beach Bash, and then stand him up.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Morgan.\u2019 Isabel raised her eyebrows. \u2018Listen to you, going all vigilante!\u2019</p><p>\u2018I think,\u2019 Heidi said, \u2018that you should find someone you really want to go with, and do it right. That\u2019s my opinion.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 I said. \u2018I think it\u2019s a little late for that.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Not necessarily,\u2019 Leah told me. \u2018It\u2019s Ladies\u2019 Night at Tallyho.\u2019</p><p>I smiled. \u2018No, no, no to Tallyho.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s my girl!\u2019 Maggie beamed, then bumped me with her shoulder.</p><p>Everyone laughed, and just like that, the conversation shifted, jumping to another topic. It was fast and furious, the talking, the emotion, the back-and-forth and forth-and-back. I realized that if I tried to focus on it too much, I got overwhelmed. So I just decided to relax into it, bumpy and crazy as it might be, and try for once to just go along for the ride.</p><p>Chapter SIXTEEN</p><p>\u2018Wow. Nice road burn.\u2019</p><p>I looked up to see Adam standing in the doorway to Heidi\u2019s office, a box under one arm. \u2018Well,\u2019 I said, putting down my tube of Neosporin, which I\u2019d been applying to the latest scrape on my shin, the result of a wobbly crash that morning. \u2018I guess that\u2019s one way of looking at it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s the only way.\u2019 He put the box down on the file cabinet, then yanked up his shirt, showing me a scar on his stomach. \u2018See this? Seventh grade, wiped out on a ramp. And then here\u2019 \u2013 he slid up his shirtsleeve, showing another shiny white spot \u2013 \u2018I crashed on a mountain bike trail when I hit a log.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Ouch.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance,\u2019 he continued, tapping his chest, \u2018is right here. All titanium, baby.\u2019</p><p>I just looked at him. \u2018What is?\u2019</p><p>\u2018The plate they used to put my sternum back together,\u2019 he replied cheerfully. \u2018Two years ago. Broke it with my full-face helmet going over a jump.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You know,\u2019 I said, considering my scrape again, \u2018you\u2019re kind of making me look like a wimp.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Not at all!\u2019 He smiled. \u2018It all counts. If you\u2019re not getting hurt, you\u2019re not riding hard enough.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Then I,\u2019 I said, \u2018am riding really hard.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s what I hear,\u2019 he said, picking up the box again. \u2018Maggie says you\u2019re like an animal out there.\u2019</p><p>I was horrified. \u2018She what?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m paraphrasing,\u2019 he said easily, flipping his hand. \u2018She says you\u2019re really working hard, that you\u2019re doing great.\u2019</p><p>I shrugged, capping the Neosporin. \u2018I don\u2019t know. If I was good, I wouldn\u2019t be all banged up like this.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Not true.\u2019</p><p>I looked up at him. \u2018No?\u2019</p><p>He shook his head. \u2018Of course not. Look at me. I\u2019m a great rider, and I\u2019ve bit dirt more times than I can even count. And the pros? They\u2019re, like, bionic, they\u2019ve crashed so much. Look at Eli. He\u2019s broken his elbow, and his collarbone multiple times, and then there\u2019s that arm thing...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Wait,\u2019 I said. \u2018The arm thing? You mean the scar?\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Yeah.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I thought that was from the accident.\u2019</p><p>Adam shook his head. \u2018No. He was doing some tricks out on the pier and landed wrong. Sliced it wide open on the edge of a bench. There was blood everywhere.\u2019</p><p>I looked back down at my knee scab, small and almost a perfect circle, shiny with ointment.</p> <p>\u2018It all counts,\u2019 Adam said again. \u2018And the bottom line is, what defines you isn\u2019t how many times you crash, but the number of times you get back on the bike. As long as it\u2019s one more, you\u2019re all good.\u2019</p><p>I smiled, looking up at him. \u2018You know,\u2019 I said, \u2018you should be a motivational speaker, or something.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nah. Entirely too dorky,\u2019 he replied easily. \u2018Hey, is Heidi around?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No. She\u2019s at lunch.\u2019 I didn\u2019t add that she was with my dad, their first formal meeting since he moved out. Heidi had been so nervous all morning, walking around the store, straightening displays and hovering over me in the office, that I\u2019d been relieved when she finally strapped Isby into the BabyBj\u00f6rn and headed off. As soon as the door shut behind her, though, I\u2019d gotten uneasy myself, wondering what she\u2019d have to say when she returned. \u2018She\u2019ll be back in an hour or so, probably.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh. Well, I can just leave these, then.\u2019 He put the box down on the desk to my left. When I glanced at them, he added, \u2018Prom shots from my yearbook days. She said she wants them for decor for the Beach Bash, or something.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Really,\u2019 I said. \u2018Can I take a look?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sure.\u2019</p><p>I lifted the lid. Inside was a big stack of pictures, mostly five-by-sevens, all black and white. The one on the top was of Maggie, standing with Jake by the tailgate of a car. She had on a short, dark A-line dress and strappy heels, her hair spilling over her shoulders. There was a corsage on her wrist and she was laughing, holding out a bag of Doritos to Jake, who was in a tux shirt and pants, barefoot on the sand. I flipped to the next picture: also Maggie, this time alone, the same night, standing on tiptoe to check her reflection in a mirror that said COCA-COLA across its center. In the next shot, there was Leah, in a more formal pose with a guy in a military uniform, both of them looking at the camera, followed by one of Wallace on a dance floor, cummerbund loose, in the midst of busting some sort of move. Then Maggie again, another year, in another dress, this one white and longer. In the first shot, she was walking down the boardwalk, holding the hand of someone whose shoulder alone made it into the picture. In the one beneath it, she was reaching out for the camera, fingers blurred, her mouth half-open as she laughed.</p><p>\u2018Wow,\u2019 I said as I kept flipping through them. There was Leah again. Esther. Maggie. Wallace and Leah. Jake and Esther. Maggie. Wallace and Esther. Maggie. Maggie. Maggie. I looked up at him. \u2018You\u2019re not in any of these.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nah. I was always behind the camera.\u2019</p><p>I moved past yet another shot of Maggie, this time on a bike, her white dress gathered up in one hand, her helmet in the other. \u2018Lots of her here.\u2019</p> <p>He kept his eyes on the picture, his tone noncommittal, as he said, \u2018I guess so.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What are you guys looking at?\u2019</p><p>Adam and I both jumped as Maggie herself \u2013 in the flesh and flip-flops and jeans \u2013 appeared behind us in the doorway. \u2018Prom pictures,\u2019 I told her, casually flipping back to the one of Leah and Wallace. \u2018Heidi wanted them for the Beach Bash.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, no.\u2019 She sighed, then stepped forward to lean over my shoulder. \u2018I can\u2019t bear to... look! Junior year. Leah\u2019s date was that marine, remember?\u2019</p><p>Adam nodded. \u2018I do.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And I had my white dress. I loved that dress.\u2019 She sighed again, this time happily, and reached over me to flip to the next picture. \u2018There it is! Man. I agonized over that outfit like you would not believe. Kept it clean all night, even when I was on a bike on a dare. And then Jake threw up all over it on the way home. The stain...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Never came out,\u2019 Adam finished for her. \u2018I have a shot of it somewhere.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hopefully not in this box.\u2019 She plucked out the one of her on the bike. \u2018That was a great night, though. I mean, until the end. What other ones are in there? Any more of me?\u2019</p> <p>I felt Adam glance at me as I eased the box shut, saying, \u2018Not really.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh,\u2019 she said. \u2018Well, I guess that\u2019s a good thing. I don\u2019t think I necessarily want my prom memories up on display for the whole town to see anyway.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No?\u2019 I said. \u2018It seems like you had a pretty good time.\u2019</p><p>She shrugged. \u2018I guess. But I was with Jake then. The last thing I need right now is another reminder of how much of my life I wasted on him.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You were happy at the time, though,\u2019 I said. \u2018That has to count for something.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 Maggie said. \u2018Lately I\u2019ve been thinking it would have been better to have just been by myself. That way, at least all of high school wouldn\u2019t be, you know, tinged with his memory.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Tinged?\u2019 Adam said. \u2018Is that even a real word?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You know what I mean,\u2019 she said, poking his arm. \u2018Anyway, my point is that if I\u2019d wised up to what he was sooner, my entire experience might have been different.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah,\u2019 I said. \u2018You could have spent all of high school alone, and never gone to prom at all.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Exactly,\u2019 she replied. \u2018And that might have been good, too. Or even better.\u2019</p><p>I looked down at the box again, remembering all those shots inside, trying to picture myself in even one of them. What if I\u2019d had a boyfriend? What if I\u2019d gone to the prom? What kind of tinge could I have had, given another chance? \u2018Maybe,\u2019 I said to Maggie. \u2018Or maybe not.\u2019</p><p>She gave me a weird look, then opened her mouth to say something, but then the front door chime sounded. \u2018Duty calls,\u2019 she said, turning on her heel, and then she was thwacking back down the hallway, her voice cheery as she greeted a group of customers.</p><p>Adam watched her go, then leaned back in the doorjamb. \u2018You know,\u2019 he said, \u2018if you want to remedy that, you can.\u2019</p><p>I looked up at him. \u2018Remedy what?\u2019</p><p>\u2018The whole not-going-to-the-prom thing,\u2019 he said. \u2018Eli\u2019s at the shop right now, doing inventory.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What,\u2019 I said, \u2018are you talking about?\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018You just walk over there and into the office and say, \u201cHey, be my prom date,\u201d\u2019 he said. \u2018It\u2019s that simple.\u2019</p><p>I wanted to tell him that nothing concerning me and Eli was simple, especially lately. Instead, I said, \u2018What makes you think I want to go with him?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Because,\u2019 he said, \u2018you\u2019re sitting here going on about spending high school alone, never going to prom at all... It was kind of obvious who you were talking about.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Maggie. I was talking about Maggie.\u2019</p> <p>He crossed his arms over his chest. \u2018Sure you were.\u2019</p><p>I just looked at him for a second. Then I said, \u2018Well, what about you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Me?\u2019</p><p>I nodded. \u2018When are you planning to ask her?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Ask her what?\u2019</p> <p>I rolled my eyes.</p><p>\u2018Oh, no. We\u2019re just friends.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Right.\u2019 I opened up the box again and started flipping through the pictures, taking out the one of her on the bike, and walking, and laughing, and in front of the mirror, laying them on the desk side by side. \u2018Because, of course, you took this many pictures of all your friends.\u2019</p><p>He glanced at the shots, then swallowed. \u2018Actually,\u2019 he said stiffly, \u2018I do have a lot of shots of Wallace.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Adam. Come on.\u2019</p><p>I watched as, defeated, he slumped into the chair, folding his arms behind his head. For a moment we just sat there, neither of us saying anything. Outside, I could hear Maggie chattering on the pros and cons of one-piece bathing suits. \u2018The thing is,\u2019 he said finally, \u2018I\u2019ve made it this far, you know? We start college in a matter of weeks.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018So?\u2019</p><p>\u2018So,\u2019 he continued, \u2018I just don\u2019t know if I want that tinge on the summer. Not to mention our friendship. An awkward tinge, that will then color everything else.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re assuming she\u2019ll say no.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 he said, \u2018I\u2019m assuming she\u2019ll say yes, because she\u2019ll figure it\u2019ll be fun. And then I\u2019ll work it up to be this big deal, like it\u2019s a real date, which is not how she\u2019ll see it, which will become crushingly obvious at the prom itself when she abandons me to dance, and then leave, and eventually marry some other guy.\u2019</p><p>Outside, Maggie laughed, the sound light and cheery, like music.</p><p>\u2018Well,\u2019 I said. \u2018At least you haven\u2019t put much thought into it.\u2019</p><p>He gave me a wry smile. \u2018Just like you haven\u2019t thought about asking Eli, right?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I haven\u2019t.\u2019</p> <p>He rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u2018No, really. We had a falling-out... We\u2019re not even talking right now.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, then. You know what you need to do.\u2019</p><p>I said, \u2018I do?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yep.\u2019 He pushed himself to his feet. \u2018Get back on that bike.\u2019</p><p>I just looked at him. \u2018It\u2019s not that simple.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sure it is,\u2019 he said. \u2018Just takes one more time. Remember?\u2019</p><p>I considered this as he started for the door, sliding his hands in his pockets. \u2018On the same note,\u2019 I said, \u2018there\u2019s a worse thing than an awkward tinge.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah?\u2019</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s that?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Always wondering if it might have gone the other way.\u2019 I nodded at the prom shots, still laid out in front of me. \u2018That is a lot of pictures. You know?\u2019</p><p>He glanced at them, then back at me. \u2018Yeah,\u2019 he said. \u2018I guess it is.\u2019</p><p>My phone beeped then, and I glanced down at it. Jason.</p><p>Are you free for lunch? I\u2019m en route to the Last</p><p>Chance, have an hour.</p><p>\u2018Gotta go,\u2019 Adam said. Then he pointed at the scab on my knee. \u2018Remember. Back on the bike!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Right,\u2019 I replied. \u2018Got it.\u2019</p><p>He flashed me a thumbs-up, then was gone, whistling \u2013 always so damn cheery, how was that? \u2013 as he headed back toward the front of the store. I looked down at Maggie\u2019s pictures, end to end, and then at my phone, where Jason\u2019s text was still on the screen. I knew I\u2019d really screwed up with Eli, turning away from him the way I had, but perhaps it wasn\u2019t too late to have a tinge of my own. Maybe good, maybe bad, but at least it would add some color, somewhere. So I picked up my phone and gave Jason his answer.</p><p>Okay. On my way.</p><p>When I got home that evening, Heidi was on the back deck, looking out at the water. Even from a distance and through the sliding glass door, I recognized the tenseness in her shoulders, the way her head leaned a little sadly to the side, and so was not surprised when she turned, hearing me, to see her eyes were red and puffy.</p><p>\u2018Auden,\u2019 she said, reaching to brush back her hair, taking a breath. \u2018I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be home until later.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I finished up early.\u2019 I slid my keys into my bag. \u2018Are you okay?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m fine.\u2019 She came inside, shutting the door behind her. \u2018Just doing some thinking.\u2019</p><p>We stood there for a moment, neither of us saying anything. Upstairs, I could hear Thisbe\u2019s waves, crashing. \u2018So... how did it go?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Good.\u2019 She swallowed, biting her lip. \u2018We did a lot of talking.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And?\u2019</p><p>\u2018And,\u2019 she said, \u2018we agreed that for the time being, it\u2019s better if we keep things as they are.\u2019</p><p>\u2018With him at the Condor,\u2019 I said, clarifying. She nodded. \u2018So he didn\u2019t want to come back.\u2019</p><p>She walked over to me, putting her hands on my shoulders. \u2018Your father... he thinks he\u2019d be a hindrance more than a help right now. That maybe, until the Beach Bash and summer is over, it\u2019s better if I just focus on me and Thisbe.\u2019</p><p>\u2018How could that be better?\u2019 I asked. \u2018You\u2019re his family.\u2019</p><p>She bit her lip again, then looked down at her hands. \u2018I know it doesn\u2019t sound like it makes sense.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It doesn\u2019t.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But I understand what he\u2019s saying,\u2019 she continued. \u2018Your father and I... we had a whirlwind courtship and marriage, and I got pregnant so fast. We just need to slow down a bit.\u2019</p><p>I put my purse down on the table. \u2018So this is a slowing. Not a full stop.\u2019</p><p>Heidi nodded. \u2018Absolutely.\u2019</p><p>To be honest, I wasn\u2019t fully convinced. I knew my dad and how he operated: if things got complicated, he extricated himself, somehow managing to make it seem like it was the most selfless of gestures, instead of just the opposite. He wasn\u2019t abandoning Heidi and Thisbe: he was simplifying their lives. He hadn\u2019t left my mom over professional envy: he\u2019d stepped aside to give her the spotlight she needed. And he certainly hadn\u2019t basically ignored the fact that I was his child all those years: he was just teaching me to be independent and a grown-up in a world in which most people were too infantile. My dad never got back on the bike. He never even let himself crash. One wobble, or even the hint of one, and he pulled over to the side, abandoning the ride altogether. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018So,\u2019 Heidi said, pulling out a chair and sitting down at the table, \u2018enough about me. What\u2019s going on with you?\u2019</p><p>I slid in opposite her, folding my hands on top of my bag. \u2018Well,\u2019 I said, \u2018it looks like I have a date to the prom.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Really?\u2019 She clapped her hands. \u2018That\u2019s great!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah. Jason just asked me.\u2019</p> <p>She blinked. \u2018Jason...\u2019</p><p>\u2018My friend from home,\u2019 I said. She still looked quizzical, so I picked up my phone, flashing it at her. \u2018The texter.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh! The one who stood you up!\u2019</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u2018Well. That\u2019s very...\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Lame?\u2019 I said.</p><p>\u2018I was going to say full circle, actually, or something to that effect,\u2019 she said slowly. \u2018What, you don\u2019t want to go?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, I do.\u2019 I looked down at my hands again. \u2018I mean, it\u2019s a second chance. I think I\u2019d be stupid not to take it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018True.\u2019 She sat back, running a hand through her hair. \u2018They don\u2019t come around that often.\u2019</p><p>I nodded, thinking of Jason at the Last Chance, how he\u2019d been waiting for me in a booth and smiled broadly when I came in the door. Over burgers and onion rings, he\u2019d gone on and on about the leadership conference, and how great it was going, and listening to him felt so familiar, but not in a bad way. It was like reversing, going back to the spring when we\u2019d shared lunches and talked about school and classes. And when he cleared his throat and said he had something to ask me, that was familiar, too, and I\u2019d agreed easily. It was just that simple.</p><p>Now, I looked at Heidi, who was staring out the window over the sink, and remembered how I\u2019d once seen her based on her effervescent e-mails and girly clothes, all flash, no substance. I\u2019d thought I knew so much when I\u2019d arrived here, the smartest girl in the room. But I\u2019d been wrong.</p> <p>\u2018Hey,\u2019 I said, \u2018can I ask you something?\u2019</p><p>She looked over at me. \u2018Of course.\u2019</p><p>\u2018A few weeks back,\u2019 I began, \u2018you said something about how my mom wasn\u2019t a truly cold bitch. How she couldn\u2019t be, because they always end up alone. Do you remember that?\u2019</p><p>Heidi furrowed her brow, thinking. \u2018Vaguely.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And then you said you knew all about cold bitches, because you used to be one yourself.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Right,\u2019 she said. \u2018So what\u2019s your question?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I guess...\u2019 I stopped, taking a breath. \u2018Were you really, though?\u2019</p><p>\u2018A cold bitch?\u2019 she asked.</p> <p>I nodded.</p><p>\u2018Oh, yeah. Totally.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I just can\u2019t picture that,\u2019 I said. \u2018I mean, you that way.\u2019</p><p>Heidi smiled. \u2018Well, you didn\u2019t know me before I came here and met your father. I was just out of business school, totally uptight. Ruthless, actually. I was killing myself gaining capital so I could open a boutique in New York. I had a business plan, and all these investor contacts, a loan, the whole deal. Nothing else mattered.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I never knew you lived in New York.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It was my plan, after I graduated,\u2019 she said. \u2018But then my mom got sick, and I had to come home here to Colby for the summer to take care of her. I\u2019d known Isabel and Morgan since high school, so I got a job with them waiting tables, just to make some extra cash for my move.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You worked at the Last Chance?\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s how I met your dad,\u2019 she said. \u2018He\u2019d just had his faculty interview at Weymar and came in for lunch. It was slow, so we started talking. And it just went from there. At the end of the summer, my mom got better for a little while, so I said good-bye to your dad and left. But once I was in New York, it just didn\u2019t feel right. I didn\u2019t have the hunger for it anymore.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Really.\u2019</p><p>She drew in a breath. \u2018I\u2019d come here planning to leave as soon as I could. It was a pit stop, not a destination. I had my whole life mapped out.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So what happened?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I guess that map didn\u2019t turn out to be mine after all,\u2019 she said. \u2018So I left New York, married your dad, and used my money to open Clementine\u2019s. And weird as it sounds, it felt perfectly right. Totally different, but perfectly right.\u2019</p><p>I thought of her face when I\u2019d come home that night, the sad way she\u2019d told me about her talk with my dad. \u2018Does it still? Feel right, I mean.\u2019</p><p>She looked at me for a moment. Then she said, \u2018Actually, yes. Of course, I wish things were different with your dad and me right now. But I have Thisbe, and my work... I have what I wanted, even if it isn\u2019t perfect. If I\u2019d stayed in New York, I would have always wondered if that was possible.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No tinge,\u2019 I said.</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019</p><p>I shook my head. \u2018Nothing.\u2019</p><p>Heidi pushed her chair out, getting to her feet. \u2018In the end, I went away for the summer, fell in love, and everything changed. It\u2019s the oldest story in the world.\u2019</p><p>The way she was looking at me as she said this made me suddenly uncomfortable, and I turned my attention back to my purse in my lap. \u2018Yeah,\u2019 I replied, pulling my phone out. \u2018I guess I have heard that before.\u2019</p><p>In response, she said nothing, instead just running a hand over the top of my head as she passed by me. \u2018Good night, Auden,\u2019 she said, stifling a yawn. \u2018Sleep well.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You, too.\u2019</p><p>And the thing was, I knew I would. Sleep, that is, and maybe even well. That was one thing that had definitely changed for me in my time here. The love part, and everything else... that didn\u2019t apply. But you never knew. I had a prom date, with it another chance to draw my own map. The summer wasn\u2019t over yet, so maybe the story wasn\u2019t either.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>\u2018Okay,\u2019 Leah said, hiking up her dress to examine the hem. \u2018I am having major flashbacks right now. Didn\u2019t we just do this?\u2019</p><p>\u2018We did,\u2019 Esther told her. \u2018In May.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And why are we doing it again?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Because it\u2019s the Beach Bash!\u2019 Maggie said.</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s a statement, not an explanation,\u2019 Leah replied. \u2018And it\u2019s definitely not reason enough to go through all this again.\u2019</p><p>We were in Heidi\u2019s bedroom, where she\u2019d sent us after hearing us complain, en masse, about not being able to find anything decent to wear to the Beach Bash Prom. My stepmother continued to surprise me. Not only was she a former cold bitch, but a shopaholic, as well. She had tons of dresses, in a variety of sizes, that she\u2019d bought over the years. Vintage, classic, entirely eighties, you name it and it was there. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018We need dates, too, remember,\u2019 Leah said. \u2018Unless Heidi\u2019s got some hot guys tucked away behind those shoe boxes.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You never know,\u2019 I said, peering into the deep recesses of the closet. \u2018At this point, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Dates aren\u2019t mandatory, this time,\u2019 Maggie said. \u2018Let\u2019s just all go together. It\u2019ll be easier not having to deal with boys anyway.\u2019</p><p>Leah shot her a look. \u2018No way. If I\u2019m having to get all dolled up and wear a nice dress, I want a cute boy to go with it. It\u2019s a deal breaker.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Well,\u2019 I said, opening up the other side closet door, \u2018tonight is Ladies\u2019 Night at Tallyho.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Finally!\u2019 Leah pointed at me. \u2018Someone understands.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Easy for her to say,\u2019 Esther said. \u2018She\u2019s the only one with a date.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But not a dress,\u2019 I replied, pulling out a black, low-cut sheath, then immediately putting it back. It was a small detail, I knew. And it wasn\u2019t like this was a real prom. But it would probably be the only one I\u2019d ever attend, so I was determined to make the most of it. So far, though, everything I\u2019d found had been too something: too bright, too short, too long, too much.</p><p>\u2018Oh, man!\u2019 Esther spun around, holding against herself a pink fifties-style dress with a full, stiff crinoline. \u2018How much will you bet me to wear this without any sense of irony?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018You have to,\u2019 Maggie said, reaching out to touch the skirt. \u2018God. It\u2019s perfect for you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Only if you wear that black one you had on earlier, the Audrey Hepburn\u2013looking one,\u2019 Esther told her.</p><p>\u2018You think? It\u2019s so dressy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So wear flip-flops with it. They are your trademark.\u2019</p><p>Maggie walked over, picking up the black dress from the bed. \u2018That could work. What do you think, Leah?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I think,\u2019 Leah, who was pulling a bright red number over her tank top, said, \u2018that if I\u2019m going to go to this thing dateless, I could wear a garbage bag and it wouldn\u2019t matter.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Why do you need a guy to dress up?\u2019 Maggie asked. \u2018Aren\u2019t we, your oldest and dearest friends, good enough company?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Maggie.\u2019 Leah yanked the dress down farther. \u2018It\u2019s a prom. Not a sisterhood retreat.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And this may be the last big thing we all do together before college. It\u2019s almost August, the summer is practically over.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t,\u2019 Esther threatened, pointing at her. \u2018Remember the rules. No waxing nostalgic until the twentieth. We agreed.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know, I know,\u2019 Maggie said, fluttering her hands in front of her face. She walked over to the bed, sitting down with the black dress across her lap. \u2018I just... I can\u2019t believe that it\u2019s all really going to be over soon. This time next year, everything will be different.\u2019</p><p>\u2018God, I hope so.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Leah!\u2019</p><p>Leah looked over from the mirror, where she was eyeing her reflection. \u2018What? So I\u2019m hoping a year from now I\u2019ll have a great boyfriend and total life satisfaction. A girl can dream, can\u2019t she?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018This is not so bad, though,\u2019 Maggie said. \u2018What we have, and had. It\u2019s not.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 I said, pushing aside another couple of dresses. \u2018It isn\u2019t.\u2019</p><p>I just sort of said this, not really thinking. It wasn\u2019t until the room got quiet that I realized they were all looking at me. \u2018See,\u2019 Maggie said, nodding at me. \u2018Auden understands.\u2019</p><p>\u2018She understood about Tallyho, too,\u2019 Leah grumbled. \u2018Not that anyone else cared about that.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Seriously, though.\u2019 Maggie looked at me. \u2018She didn\u2019t get to do all this, back then. If you need a reason to go to the prom, and dress up, and do it all over again, do it for Auden. She missed it the first time around.\u2019</p><p>Leah glanced at me, then back at her reflection. \u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 she said. \u2018It\u2019s a lot to ask.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So what,\u2019 Esther said, bouncing up and down, her crinoline rustling. \u2018It gives you an excuse to go to Tallyho.\u2019</p><p>\u2018True,\u2019 Leah agreed.</p><p>\u2018You don\u2019t have to, you know,\u2019 I said to Maggie, who was watching me as I pulled on another dress. \u2018I\u2019ve got Jason to go with. I\u2019ll be fine.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No way,\u2019 she replied. \u2018For the true prom experience, you need your friends there.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Because who else but your friends,\u2019 Esther said, \u2018would agree to help you re-create your past, just to fix some wrong that\u2019s been niggling you ever since?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nobody,\u2019 Leah said.</p><p>\u2018Nobody,\u2019 Maggie repeated.</p><p>They were all looking at me. \u2018Nobody,\u2019 I said, although I could think of one other answer besides this one, even if I couldn\u2019t say it out loud.</p><p>Even with my affirmation, though, they continued to stare at me, to the point that I started to wonder if I had ink on my face, or my underwear was showing. I was just about to do a panicked mirror check when Maggie said, \u2018Wow. Auden. That\u2019s the one.\u2019</p><p>\u2018The what?\u2019 I said.</p><p>\u2018Your dress,\u2019 Esther said, nodding at me. \u2018It looks amazing.\u2019</p><p>I looked down at the purple dress I\u2019d pulled on moments earlier, which I hadn\u2019t even really looked at that closely, yanking it from the closet only because it was not red or black or white, like everything else I\u2019d tried on. Now, though, as I stepped in front of the mirror, I saw that it did fit me pretty well. The neckline was flattering, the skirt full, and I liked how it brought out my eyes. It wasn\u2019t a dress to stop traffic, but maybe I didn\u2019t need that anyway.</p><p>\u2018Really?\u2019 I said.</p><p>\u2018Definitely.\u2019 Maggie came over to stand beside me, reaching out a hand to touch the skirt. \u2018Don\u2019t you like it?\u2019</p><p>I studied my reflection. I\u2019d never been one for dresses or bold colors, and had never owned anything that shade of purple before in my life. I looked like a different girl. But maybe that was the point. And like having the right snacks, for a true adventure, the proper attire is everything.</p><p>\u2018Yeah,\u2019 I said, reaching down with my fingers to pull the skirt to one side. When I dropped it, it swished back, rearranging itself, as if it already knew where it belonged. \u2018It\u2019s perfect.\u2019</p><p>Chapter SEVENTEEN</p><p>The morning of the Beach Bash, I woke at eight A.M. to the sound of Isby crying through our shared wall. I rolled over, burying my head in the pillow, and waited for Heidi to come and quiet her down. A few minutes later, the crying turned to sobbing, and I began to wonder what was going on. When she started to all-out scream, I went to investigate. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I found her on her back in her crib, red faced, hair matted down with sweat. When she saw me lean over her, she yelled louder, waving her arms madly in front of her face. When I picked her up, cradling her against me, she quieted down, emitting only a bunch of little gasps, like hiccups.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re okay,\u2019 I told her, jiggling her slightly as I stuck my head out in the hallway. No sign yet of Heidi, which was sort of worrisome, so I went back in and changed the baby\u2019s diaper, which cheered her up considerably. Then I swaddled her up and headed downstairs, where I came upon Heidi sitting at the kitchen table, boxes of prom favors stacked all around her, the phone to her ear.</p><p>\u2018Yes, Robert, I understand your predicament,\u2019 she was saying as she fiddled with a coffee mug in front of her. \u2018But the truth is I was counting on you, and I don\u2019t know if I can find someone else on such short notice.\u2019</p><p>I could hear my dad\u2019s voice, distant, replying to this through the receiver. It made me realize how long it had been since I\u2019d spoken to him: a week, maybe even two. He\u2019d finally got the message of my not replying to his messages, though. My voice mail had been empty for a while now.</p> <p>\u2018You know what,\u2019 she said suddenly, \u2018it\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll just find someone. No, don\u2019t worry about it. Really. But I need to go now. I have a ton of stuff to do today, and...\u2019</p><p>She stopped talking, and I heard my dad\u2019s voice again. Whatever he was saying, it elicited nothing from Heidi but a sigh and a shake of her head.</p><p>I hesitated, wondering if I should just go back upstairs. But then Isby let out a squawk, and Heidi turned, spotting us.</p><p>\u2018... I have to go,\u2019 she said, then hung up without a goodbye. She pushed out her chair. \u2018Oh, Auden, I\u2019m so sorry she woke you up! I thought I heard her, but I was on the phone and...\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s fine,\u2019 I said as she reached for the baby, smiling at her as she lifted her from my arms. \u2018I was kind of up anyway.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018You and me both.\u2019 She tucked Isby over her shoulder, patting her back as she walked to the coffeemaker, pouring herself a fresh cup, then one for me. As she handed it over, she said, \u2018I jolted awake at four, thinking about everything I had to do in the next fifteen hours. And of course, then when I was feeling just a little bit on top of things, your father called to say he can\u2019t watch the baby tonight after all, because he\u2019s got to jet off to New York to meet with his agent first thing Monday morning about his book.\u2019</p><p>I considered this as she sat down at the table again, arranging Thisbe in her lap. \u2018Well,\u2019 I said. \u2018I can stay with her, if you want.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You?\u2019 She shook her head. \u2018Of course not! You\u2019re going to the Beach Bash.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t have to.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes you do! You have a date and everything.\u2019</p><p>I shrugged, looking down at my coffee.</p> <p>\u2018What\u2019s wrong? I thought you were excited.\u2019</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure exactly how to explain the hesitation that had come over me ever since I\u2019d found my dress. It was just this weird sad feeling, like the prom had already fallen short before it even happened. \u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 I said. \u2018I guess it\u2019s just that it\u2019s not the real prom, you know? I mean, it\u2019ll be fun and everything. But it won\u2019t be the same as if I\u2019d gone the first time around, to the real one.\u2019</p><p>Heidi considered this, still patting Isby\u2019s back. \u2018Well, I guess you could look at it that way,\u2019 she said. \u2018Or, you could realize you\u2019re lucky to have another try, and that it\u2019s up to you to make it memorable.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah,\u2019 I said. \u2018I guess.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Look,\u2019 she said, putting down her cup. \u2018The basic fact of the matter is that no, this isn\u2019t ideal. Very few things are. Sometimes, you have to manufacture your own history. Give fate a push, so to speak. You know?\u2019</p><p>Right away, I thought of me and Eli, working our way down my quest. Each of those things \u2013 bowling, food fights, tossing newspapers \u2013 had happened late and out of order, not exactly as they probably should have. But the memories and experiences were no less real because of it. If anything, they were more special, because they hadn\u2019t happened to me, but because of me. And him.</p><p>\u2018You know what?\u2019 I said to Heidi. \u2018You\u2019re absolutely right.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Am I?\u2019 She smiled. \u2018Well, that\u2019s a nice thing to hear. Especially considering the day I still have ahead of me.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018It\u2019ll be fine,\u2019 I told her, drinking down the rest of my coffee and going for a refill. On the way, I picked up her cup, taking it with me. \u2018I\u2019m up and ready to help. What can I do?\u2019</p><p>She groaned, pulling a yellow legal pad out of one of the favor boxes and flipping up a page. \u2018Well, there are favors to bring to the hall. And the punch bowl to pick up. And the DJ to meet at ten A.M. for a sound check. Oh, and the balloon people are demanding payment before they\u2019ll do anything, and now I have to find a babysitter...\u2019</p><p>I slid her now-full mug in front of her, then took my seat again. In her arms, Isby looked at me, and I reached out, running a hand over her head. Her skin was warm and soft, and she kept her eyes on me for a moment before tucking in tighter to her mother\u2019s chest and closing them, drifting off even in the midst of everything.</p><p>By noon, I\u2019d dealt with the balloon people, made two trips to the hall where the prom was happening, and pulled a muscle in my shoulder helping Heidi move the photo backdrop \u2013 a large, wooden fake wave dotted with fish made by the local senior arts group \u2013 into place. I was sticky and sore and on my way back to the house to pick up a box of punch glasses when I saw Jason.</p><p>He was getting out of his car, which was parked right by the top of the boardwalk. When he turned and saw me, he stiffened, then lifted a hand to wave.</p><p>\u2018Auden,\u2019 he called out, hurrying closer. \u2018I\u2019ve been trying to call you.\u2019</p><p>I had a flash of my phone, which I was pretty sure I\u2019d left on the kitchen table. \u2018Oh,\u2019 I said. \u2018I\u2019ve been running around all morning.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Your stepmother said,\u2019 he replied. \u2018I finally looked up your dad\u2019s home number. Luckily there are only a couple of Wests here.\u2019</p><p>Behind him, I could see Adam coming out of the bike shop, wheeling a red bike with a sign that said READY TO GO! hanging from its handlebars. He parked it by the bench, then went back inside, the door banging behind him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018So look,\u2019 Jason said. \u2018I need to talk to you about tonight.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Okay.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not...\u2019 He stopped, then took a breath. \u2018I\u2019m not going to be able to make it.\u2019</p><p>I was surprised by the way I reacted, hearing this. My face flushed, my heartbeat jumped. It was like every time I got on the bike, a mix of fear and inevitability, all at once. \u2018You\u2019re canceling on me?\u2019 I said. \u2018Seriously? Again?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I know.\u2019 He winced. \u2018It\u2019s totally rude of me. I wouldn\u2019t blame you if you never spoke to me again.\u2019</p><p>This was when I was supposed to proclaim otherwise. I didn\u2019t. I just waited for the excuse, because there always was one.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s just, there\u2019s this speaker coming today to the conference,\u2019 he said quickly. \u2018She\u2019s a leader in student activism, has really made some big changes at Harvard, where she went undergrad, and now Yale, where she\u2019s in law school. I mean, incredible policy-changing stuff. So she\u2019s a great contact for me.\u2019</p><p>I said nothing as Adam came out once again, this time pushing a smaller green bike. It had fatter tires, a glossy black seat, and was polished so clean it was glinting in the sun. ENJOY YOUR RIDE! said its sign, which was swinging in the breeze.</p><p>\u2018Anyway,\u2019 Jason continued, \u2018her talk is this afternoon, but then she\u2019s going to dinner with a select few attendees to talk about some of her experiences one on one. No first years were supposed to be invited, but apparently she\u2019d heard about that recycling initiative I did junior year, so...\u2019</p> <p>I was listening, even as I watched Adam push out another bike, this one a two-seater. YOU\u2019LL LOOK SWEET! said its sign, with a heart around it.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s just,\u2019 Jason finished finally. \u2018It\u2019s something I have to do. I\u2019m sorry.\u2019</p><p>Right then, I realized something. I wasn\u2019t upset that Jason was ditching me. That racing of my heart, the flushing of my face I was feeling: it was what happened when you got hurt, true, but also when you got back up and went on. Maybe Jason had never been meant to be part of my second chance anyway, and this was just the push that I, and fate, needed.</p><p>\u2018You know what?\u2019 I said to him. \u2018It\u2019s fine.\u2019</p><p>He blinked at me. \u2018Really?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Really.\u2019 I took a breath, making sure this true. Weirdly, it was. \u2018I\u2019m okay with this.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018You are?\u2019 I nodded. \u2018Oh, God, Auden, thanks for understanding. I figured you\u2019d be so angry with me! But you of all people understand the academic thing, right? I mean, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and...\u2019</p><p>He was still talking as I stepped around him and started toward the bike shop. Vaguely, I heard him saying something about understanding and obligation, commitment and future endeavors, all the buzzwords and concepts I did understand, and knew so well. Unlike what I was now approaching. Still, more than ever this summer, I\u2019d learned that it\u2019s not just where you go, but how you choose to get there. So I pulled that sign off the green bike \u2013 ENJOY YOUR RIDE! \u2013 and went inside to take the first step toward doing just that.</p><p>\u2018Guess what?\u2019 Maggie said as soon as I walked into Clementine\u2019s.</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019</p><p>She clapped her hands. \u2018I have a date for the prom!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Guess what?\u2019 I replied.</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t.\u2019 Her mouth dropped open. \u2018Oh, and,\u2019 I added, \u2018I bought a bike.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018What?\u2019 she said, but I was already walking past her. I heard her fall in behind me, yelling to some customers by the jeans that she\u2019d be with them in a second, and when I pushed open the door to the office, she was right on my heels.</p><p>\u2018Okay, let\u2019s just slow down.\u2019 She held up her hands, palms facing me. \u2018First things first. What do you mean, you don\u2019t have a date?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Just that,\u2019 I said, sitting down at the desk. \u2018Jason bailed on me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Again?\u2019</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u2018When?\u2019</p><p>\u2018About twenty minutes ago.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, my God.\u2019 She put a hand over her mouth: her expression was so horrified, like someone had died. \u2018That\u2019s the worst thing ever.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 I said, swallowing. \u2018It\u2019s actually not.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No?\u2019</p><p>I shook my head. \u2018The worst thing is that right afterward, I marched right into the bike shop to ask Eli to go with me, and he said no.\u2019</p><p>She threw up her other hand, clapping it over the one already covering her mouth. \u2018Holy crap,\u2019 she said, her voice muffled. \u2018Where does the bike come in?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 I said, waving my hand. \u2018That part\u2019s kind of a blur.\u2019</p><p>Her eyes widened, and she dropped her hands, sticking her head back out in the hallway. After checking on the customers, she whipped out her phone. \u2018Don\u2019t move,\u2019 she said, fingers flying over the keyboard. \u2018I\u2019m calling for backup.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Maggie.\u2019 I groaned. \u2018Please don\u2019t.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Too late.\u2019 She pushed one last button. \u2018It\u2019s done.\u2019</p><p>Which was how, twenty minutes later, I found myself sitting in the same spot, now surrounded by not only Maggie but also Leah and Esther, with a large cup of coffee and two packs of chocolate cupcakes on the desk in front of me.</p><p>\u2018Cupcakes?\u2019 Maggie said to Esther. \u2018Really?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I panicked,\u2019 Esther replied. \u2018What kind of snack does a situation like this call for?\u2019</p><p>Leah thought for a moment. \u2018The pharmaceutical kind.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, they don\u2019t have that at the Gas/Gro. So cupcakes it is.\u2019 Esther looked at me. \u2018Okay. We\u2019re all here now. What happened?\u2019</p><p>I picked up the coffee, taking a sip, and immediately wanted to drain the whole thing. Instead, I told them.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t like I had a solid plan when I pulled open the bike shop door. All I could think was that here I had another chance, and this time, I was going to do it right.</p><p>It seemed like the best sign possible, maybe even ideal, that I spotted Eli the minute I stepped inside the door. He was behind the counter, his back to me, stuffing something into a duffel bag, and seeing him, I had the same reaction I\u2019d had for weeks now, a sudden embarrassment about how I\u2019d acted, followed by an urge to run in the other direction as fast as I could. Instead, I gripped the sign in my hand even tighter, and pressed on. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Hey,\u2019 I said as I came up on the counter. My voice sounded loud and ragged, rushed, and I told myself to take a breath. Which got considerably more difficult as he turned around to face me.</p><p>\u2018Hey.\u2019 He was looking at me with a wary expression. \u2018What\u2019s up?\u2019</p><p>In a perfect world, I would have eased into what I had to say gradually. Worked up to it, phrasing it neatly and succinctly with all the right adjectives. As it was, I just blurted out, \u2018Do you remember that first time we went bowling?\u2019</p><p>Eli raised his eyebrows. Then he looked in the repair room behind him, where, distantly, I could see Adam and Wallace, standing in the door that led out to the back alley, their backs to us. \u2018Yeah,\u2019 he said after a moment. \u2018Why?\u2019</p> <p>I swallowed, the sound seeming incredibly loud in my own ears. \u2018I was all annoyed, because I wasn\u2019t good at it. And you said I shouldn\u2019t have expected to be, because I\u2019d never done it before, and what mattered was that I keep trying.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Right,\u2019 he said slowly. \u2018I remember.\u2019</p><p>I knew I was on the verge of losing my nerve. I could literally feel it slipping away, second by second, like a wave slowly pulling itself back out to sea. But I kept going anyway.</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s what happened with us,\u2019 I said. \u2018With me. What we were doing... what we had... it was my first time. You know, where it mattered. And I wasn\u2019t good at it. I sucked, actually.\u2019</p><p>He narrowed his eyes. Oh, Jesus, I thought. That didn\u2019t come out right.</p> <p>\u2018At being with you,\u2019 I added quickly. \u2018I was bad at, you know, us. It was all new to me. I screwed it up because I didn\u2019t know what I was doing, and that scared me so I didn\u2019t even want to try. It\u2019s like the bike. Which you were also right about, by the way.\u2019</p><p>It was very, very quiet in the shop all around us, which made all of this sound that much more loud. In fact, I probably would have been completely humiliated, if I\u2019d let my words catch up with me. All the more reason to keep going.</p><p>\u2018What I\u2019m saying,\u2019 I said, because God knew I needed some clarification, \u2018is that I\u2019m sorry. You can call it crazy, or call it chicken salad, or whatever. But I want to do what you said, keep trying. So I\u2019m doing that by coming here and asking you to go to the prom with me tonight.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yo, Eli!\u2019 I heard Wallace yell, suddenly, from behind him. \u2018Train\u2019s leaving. Time to go!\u2019</p><p>Eli didn\u2019t respond, though. He was still looking at me, his face serious. As I stared back at him I tried to remember all those hours we\u2019d spent together, and how they\u2019d begun and ended in pretty much this very same space. Because of this, it seemed more right than ever to be there now, when I\u2019d know for sure whether we\u2019d continue, or end for good. I knew, too, that these were the two possibilities. But for some reason, I figured he\u2019d pick the other one.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 he said. And the thing was, it seemed true as he picked up his bag, slinging it over one shoulder. \u2018But I can\u2019t.\u2019</p> <p>I felt myself nod stupidly. And then, with one last look \u2013 intense, and almost sad \u2013 he was gone, turning his back and walking through the office, past Adam and Wallace, and out of sight. A second later, the door banged shut behind him. Done.</p><p>\u2018Auden!\u2019 I turned my head, still stunned, to see Adam coming toward me. \u2018Are you looking for Eli? Because he just \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 I said too quickly. \u2018I\u2019m not.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh. Okay.\u2019 He glanced at Wallace, who shrugged. \u2018Well, is there something else you needed?\u2019</p><p>I was really just looking for a way to save face, to get out of there gracefully. But then, I looked down again at the sign still in my hand \u2013 ENJOY YOUR RIDE! \u2013 and it seemed, suddenly, to be just that. A sign.</p><p>\u2018Actually,\u2019 I said. \u2018There is one thing.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Call it chicken salad?\u2019 Esther laughed, clapping her hands.</p><p>\u2018That is so retro! I haven\u2019t heard that since grade school.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I,\u2019 Leah said, \u2018never understood what that meant.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So that\u2019s how you ended up with the bike,\u2019 Maggie said.</p><p>\u2018Bike?\u2019 Leah said. \u2018What does a bike have to do with any of this?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I just bought one,\u2019 I told her. \u2018Apparently.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Because she also just learned how to ride one,\u2019 Maggie explained. \u2018I\u2019ve been teaching her every morning, on the sly. She never knew before.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Really?\u2019 Esther looked at me. \u2018Wow. That\u2019s impressive.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That I didn\u2019t know, or I learned?\u2019 I asked.</p><p>Esther considered this. \u2018Both,\u2019 she said finally.</p><p>\u2018People! Let\u2019s stay focused.\u2019 Leah turned to me. \u2018Okay, so Eli shot you down. It\u2019s not the end of the world.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 I said, \u2018it\u2019s just incredibly humiliating, and now I can never face him again.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I wonder why he said no?\u2019 Maggie mused.</p><p>\u2018Because he\u2019s Eli,\u2019 I told her.</p><p>Leah rolled her eyes. \u2018That\u2019s a statement, not an explanation.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What I mean is,\u2019 I said, \u2018I know what he\u2019s like. I had my chance with him, and I blew it. So he\u2019s done.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Wait.\u2019 Esther held up her hand. \u2018Back up. When were you and Eli an item?\u2019</p><p>Once again, I had everyone\u2019s attention as I said, \u2018Um, we were hanging out a lot, a few weeks back.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Doing what?\u2019 Leah asked.</p><p>I thought of Eli and me, in the car, driving through the dark streets of Colby, alone and together, all those nights. Shopping, eating, talking, questing. We\u2019d done so much it seemed impossible to narrow it down to any one word. So instead, I decided to go with the one thing we hadn\u2019t done, at least until the very end. \u2018We couldn\u2019t sleep,\u2019 I said. \u2018So we were just up, together.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Until you blew it,\u2019 Esther said, clarifying.</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u2018What\u2019d you do?\u2019</p><p>I looked down at my cold coffee. \u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 I said. \u2018Something happened, and I got scared and pulled away.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Okay, well, that\u2019s not vague,\u2019 Leah said.</p><p>\u2018Leah!\u2019 Esther said.</p><p>\u2018What? \u201cSomething happened\u201d? What does that mean?\u2019 They all looked at me again, and under their gazes I realized that this, too, was a point where I usually pulled back. Folded into myself, hiding away. But considering what I\u2019d already been through that day, it seemed only fitting to go for broke. \u2018My dad and Heidi separating,\u2019 I said. \u2018It... it kicked up a lot of stuff for me. And I dealt with it the way I did when my parents split.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Which was?\u2019 Esther asked.</p><p>I shrugged. \u2018Throwing myself into books and school, basically blocking everyone out. Especially anyone who might call me on it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Like Eli,\u2019 Maggie said.</p><p>\u2018Especially Eli,\u2019 I replied. \u2018We\u2019d had this one night where we really connected... and the next day, I just shut down on him. It was so stupid of me.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Did you tell him that, though?\u2019 Maggie asked. \u2018Today?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yep,\u2019 I said. \u2018But like I said, it was too late. He\u2019s done.\u2019</p><p>There was a moment of quiet as this was processed and considered. I picked up the pack of cupcakes, then put them back down.</p><p>\u2018Well,\u2019 Leah said finally, \u2018I say, screw it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Leah.\u2019 Esther sighed. \u2018Honestly.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018No, really. So you\u2019re humiliated. It happens. And who needs boys anyway? We\u2019ll all just go to the prom together tonight and have a good time.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I thought,\u2019 Esther said to her, \u2018that you were determined to have a date, or you weren\u2019t going.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That was before I\u2019d exhausted all my options,\u2019 Leah explained. \u2018Now, I\u2019m embracing my single status and just hanging with the girls. Like we all are. Right?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Right,\u2019 Esther said.</p><p>They both looked at me. I said, \u2018You know, having been rejected twice, I\u2019m thinking I might just stay home.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 Leah shook her head. \u2018That\u2019s a total quitter attitude.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Twice,\u2019 I said again, holding up two fingers. \u2018In fifteen minutes, within a hundred feet of each other. What\u2019s next? An anvil on my head?\u2019</p><p>\u2018This,\u2019 Esther said to me, \u2018is exactly when you need to go out with the girls. It\u2019s a textbook situation. You go with us, we dance together, you\u2019ll feel better. Right, Mags?\u2019</p><p>I hadn\u2019t noticed until right then that Maggie had kind of shrunk back toward the door, one foot actually already out in the hall. When we all turned our attention to her, she flushed. \u2018Well,\u2019 she said. \u2018Actually...\u2019</p><p>Silence. Then Leah said, \u2018Actually what?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I kind of have a date.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 Esther said. \u2018What happened to sisterhood?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You guys were totally blowing that off up until this very second!\u2019 Maggie protested. \u2018How was I supposed to know you\u2019d actually come around?\u2019</p><p>\u2018If you tell me you\u2019re going with Jake Stock,\u2019 Leah warned, \u2018my head is going to explode.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018No.\u2019 Maggie flushed again, then looked down at her hands. \u2018Adam asked me.\u2019</p><p>Leah and Esther looked at each other. Then at Maggie. Then at each other again. \u2018Holy crap,\u2019 Esther said, exhaling. \u2018Finally!\u2019</p><p>\u2018No shit,\u2019 Leah said. \u2018He finally got up the nerve!\u2019</p><p>Maggie brightened, stepping back into the office. \u2018So you\u2019re not mad?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Of course we are,\u2019 Leah said.</p><p>\u2018But,\u2019 Esther added, \u2018we\u2019re also happy that this sexual tension that\u2019s been going on for years \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Years,\u2019 Leah agreed.</p><p>\u2018\u2013 will finally be resolved, one way or another,\u2019 Esther finished.</p><p>\u2018Oh, it\u2019s not like that,\u2019 Maggie said, flipping her hand. \u2018We\u2019re just going as friends.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 I said. \u2018You\u2019re not.\u2019</p><p>She looked at me. \u2018What?\u2019</p><p>\u2018He likes you,\u2019 I told her. \u2018He told me. And I\u2019m telling you because if you blow your chance, you\u2019ll be really sorry. Trust me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Excuse me?\u2019 I heard someone yell from the sales floor. \u2018Is anyone working here?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Whoops,\u2019 Maggie said, turning around.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m on it,\u2019 Esther told her, brushing past her to the hallway. Leah followed her, tossing her cup in the trash as she went. A moment later I heard them burst out, already chattering at the customer, as if to compensate for the silence.</p><p>Maggie leaned against the doorjamb, looking in at me as I sat back in the office chair. \u2018I wish you\u2019d reconsider about tonight,\u2019 she said after a moment. \u2018It\u2019s still a memory worth having, even if it\u2019s not exactly what you imagined.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know,\u2019 I told her. \u2018But honestly, I just don\u2019t think I have it in me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, if you change your mind, we\u2019ll be there. Okay?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Okay.\u2019</p><p>She nodded, then pushed off the door, heading back to work. \u2018Oh, I meant to tell you,\u2019 she said. \u2018Your bike? It\u2019s awesome.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You think?\u2019</p><p>\u2018A Gossie with Whiplash cranks, a Tweedle fork, and those fat Russel tires? You can\u2019t go wrong.\u2019</p><p>I sighed. \u2018Well. At least I\u2019ll be leaving at the end of the summer with something.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I think,\u2019 she said, \u2018that was already the case.\u2019</p><p>And then she patted the doorjamb twice and was gone again. I looked back at my cupcakes, noting that somehow Esther had remembered that they were the one thing I\u2019d bought, on impulse, all those weeks ago. I unwrapped them, pulled one out, and took a bite. It was too rich, the icing sticky. But weirdly enough, it did match the coffee perfectly.</p><p>Chapter EIGHTEEN</p><p>\u2018Are you sure about this?\u2019 Heidi asked, for about the millionth time as she stood in the open door. \u2018Because I can probably still \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Heidi.\u2019 I shifted Isby to my other hip. \u2018Go.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But it just seems so wrong! If anyone should miss this, it\u2019s me. It\u2019s not like I haven\u2019t been to \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Go,\u2019 I repeated.</p><p>\u2018Look, if I find someone there who can relieve you, I\u2019ll just send them \u2013\u2019</p><p>I narrowed my eyes, shooting her the best cold bitch look I could muster. She recoiled slightly, and stepped out onto the porch.</p><p>\u2018Okay, fine,\u2019 she said. \u2018I\u2019m going.\u2019</p><p>I stood there, watching, as she started down the steps. After much debate, she\u2019d selected a long, coral-colored dress with spaghetti straps. It had looked strange on the hanger \u2013 too plain, the color odd \u2013 but once on, she was a total knockout. All the more reason not to wear the Baby-Bj\u00f6rn over it, which had been her original plan, as she\u2019d never found a babysitter.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m fine,\u2019 I\u2019d assured her, hours ago, when I volunteered. \u2018I don\u2019t want to go to the prom, I told you that.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018But it\u2019s your one chance!\u2019 She sighed, looking at Isby, who was on the bedroom floor between us on her little play gym, kicking her feet at the ladybug hanging overhead. \u2018I just hate how all this turned out for you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m really okay,\u2019 I said. She studied me, doubtful. I said, \u2018I am.\u2019</p><p>Weirdly enough, this was kind of true. Even with my morning of double rejections. Even though I\u2019d walked my new bike home, instead of riding it, as I just was not up for another bruise to my shins, elbows, or ego. Even after I\u2019d taken that violet dress out of my room and laid it across Heidi\u2019s bed, and slipped on my sweats and a tank top, dressing down just as everyone else began dressing up. In some ways, maybe this was what I\u2019d done back in May, my first time around. But it was also totally different.</p><p>I realized now why Maggie was so sure I\u2019d be leaving with more than a bike at the end of the summer. Because it was obvious, this true difference in me now: I had these experiences, these tales, more of this life. So maybe it wasn\u2019t the fairy tale. But those stories weren\u2019t real anyway. Mine were.</p> <p>Once Heidi was gone, I carried Isby out to the deck, holding her up so she could see the water. There were still people out on the beach, soaking up the last of the daylight, while others were already out for their evening walks, proceeding past in couples, or groups, dogs and children running out ahead or lagging behind. We watched for a while, then headed back inside, where I heard someone knocking at the door.</p><p>As I passed the kitchen table, I saw Heidi\u2019s phone, sitting right next to the saltshaker. She\u2019d missed two calls \u2013 whoops \u2013 before realizing and doubling back for it. When I pulled the door open, holding the phone out with my other hand, I saw it wasn\u2019t Heidi after all. It was my mother.</p><p>\u2018Hi, Auden,\u2019 she said. \u2018Can I come in?\u2019</p><p>In response, Isby let out a squawk. My mom looked at the baby, then at me. \u2018Sure,\u2019 I said, then realized I needed to step back to make room for this to actually happen. \u2018Of course.\u2019</p><p>I retreated, she advanced, and then, somehow, I was shutting the door behind me and shoving Heidi\u2019s phone into my back pocket before following her as she walked, slowly, through the foyer and toward the kitchen. I wasn\u2019t sure what it was about her that was so jarring, especially since she looked just the same: dark hair piled on her head, black skirt and tank top, the onyx necklace that hung right at her collarbone, emphasizing its sharpness. But still, something was different.</p> <p>\u2018So,\u2019 I said slowly, shifting Isby back to my other hip. \u2018What are you doing here?\u2019</p><p>My mom turned and looked at me. Under the brighter lights of the kitchen, I saw she looked tired, even kind of sad. \u2018I\u2019ve been worried about you. Ever since our last conversation. I kept telling myself I was just being silly, but then...\u2019</p><p>She trailed off, and I realized how rare this was, her using my dad\u2019s old trick. My mom never liked to leave any of her meaning in another person\u2019s hands. \u2018But then,\u2019 I repeated.</p><p>\u2018I came anyway,\u2019 she finished. \u2018Call it a mother\u2019s prerogative. I wonder if your dad and Heidi can spare a cup of coffee?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Of course,\u2019 I said, walking over to the cupboard to pull out a mug. I was trying to reach up to get one and manage Isby, who had suddenly decided to go all squirmy on me, when I looked over at my mom, who was watching me with a curious expression. \u2018Do you think you could \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh,\u2019 she said. Then she sat up straighter, as if about to be graded on something, and held out her hands. \u2018Certainly.\u2019</p> <p>I handed Isby over, feeling my mom\u2019s fingers brush mine as she left my hands for hers. Before I turned back to get the coffee, it struck me how strange it was to see my mother with a baby. She looked awkward sitting there, her arms bent at the elbow, studying Isby\u2019s face with a clinical expression, as if she was a puzzle or riddle. In turn, Isby stared back at her, googly eyed, moving her little hands in circles, around and around again. Still, when I slid the coffee in front of her a few moments later, I stood at her side, prepared to take over. But she kept her eyes on the baby, so I sat down instead.</p><p>\u2018She\u2019s very cute,\u2019 she said finally. \u2018Looks a little like you did at this age.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Really?\u2019</p><p>My mom nodded. \u2018It\u2019s the eyes. They\u2019re just like your father\u2019s.\u2019</p><p>I looked at Isby, who seemed to be not at all worried about being held by a stranger, much less one who was clearly somewhat uncomfortable. As far as she knew, everyone she met had her best interest at heart.</p><p>\u2018I didn\u2019t mean to worry you,\u2019 I said to my mom now. \u2018I\u2019ve just... there\u2019s just been a lot going on.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I could tell.\u2019 She eased Isby into a seated position, picking up her coffee with her other hand. \u2018But I still got worried, when in that last call, you started asking about the divorce. You sounded so different.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Different how?\u2019 I asked.</p> <p>She considered this for a minute. Then she said, \u2018The word that comes to mind is younger, actually. Although for the life of me, I can\u2019t explain why that is.\u2019</p><p>It made sense to me, but I didn\u2019t say so. Instead, I reached out, taking one of Isby\u2019s fat fingers and squeezing it. She looked at me, then back at my mom.</p><p>\u2018The truth is, I thought I was losing you,\u2019 she said, more to Isby than to me. \u2018When you came down here, to your father and Heidi, and made all these friends. And then with the argument we had about the dorms... I suppose I\u2019d just gotten comfortable thinking we were on the same page. And then, suddenly, we weren\u2019t. It was very strange. Almost lonely.\u2019</p><p>Almost, I thought. Out loud I said, \u2018Just because we don\u2019t see eye to eye on everything doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t be close.\u2019</p><p>\u2018True,\u2019 she agreed. \u2018But I suppose it was just very jarring for me. To see you changing so quickly. It was like you had this whole world of traditions and language I didn\u2019t understand, and there wasn\u2019t a place in it for me.\u2019</p><p>She was still looking at Isby as she said this \u2013 face to her face, her hands around the baby\u2019s waist \u2013 as if these words were meant for her ears alone. \u2018I know the feeling,\u2019 I said.</p><p>\u2018Do you?\u2019</p><p>I nodded. \u2018Yeah. I do.\u2019</p><p>Now, she turned, looking at me. \u2018I could not bear,\u2019 she said slowly, making sure each word was clear, \u2018to think that a choice I made in my life had somehow ruined yours. That would be unthinkable for me.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I thought of us that night on the phone, the way her voice had softened suddenly, when I\u2019d brought up the divorce. My mother had always had her cold, hard shell, this brittle armor she put up between her and everyone else. But maybe, all along, she\u2019d seen it differently. That I was not outside, banging to get in, but in there with her, protected and safe, giving her all the more reason to stay that way.</p><p>\u2018You didn\u2019t ruin my life,\u2019 I told her. \u2018I just wish we\u2019d talked more.\u2019</p><p>\u2018About the divorce?\u2019</p><p>\u2018About everything.\u2019</p> <p>She nodded, and for a moment, we just sat there, both of us watching Isby, who was studying her feet. Then she said, \u2018That\u2019s never been my strong suit. The emotional talking thing.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know,\u2019 I agreed. She looked at me. \u2018It wasn\u2019t mine either. But I kind of got a crash course this summer.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Really,\u2019 she said.</p><p>\u2018Yeah.\u2019 I took in a breath. \u2018It\u2019s not that hard, actually.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well.\u2019 She swallowed. \u2018Maybe you can teach me sometime.\u2019</p> <p>I smiled at her. I\u2019d just reached to put my hand over hers, feeling it warm beneath mine, when I felt Heidi\u2019s phone buzz in my back pocket.</p><p>\u2018Shoot,\u2019 I said, pulling it out. \u2018I better get this.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Go ahead,\u2019 she replied, sitting back and resettling Isby on her lap. \u2018We\u2019re fine.\u2019</p><p>I got to my feet, then hit TALK without checking the ID. \u2018Hello?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Heidi?\u2019</p><p>The fact that my dad didn\u2019t recognize my voice said something, although I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to think about what, exactly. I considered just hanging up, taking the coward\u2019s way out. But instead I said, \u2018No. It\u2019s Auden.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Oh.\u2019 A pause. \u2018Hi there.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hi,\u2019 I said. I looked at my mom, who was watching me, then turned my back, starting into the foyer. It still seemed too close, though, so I headed upstairs. \u2018Um, Heidi\u2019s not here. She left her phone by accident when she went to the Beach Bash.\u2019</p><p>It was very quiet on the line, so quiet that I had to wonder why there is interference or static only you really want to hear what the other person is saying. \u2018Well,\u2019 he said finally. \u2018How are you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m okay,\u2019 I told him. \u2018Busy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I figured. I\u2019ve left you some messages.\u2019 He cleared his throat. \u2018I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re angry at me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 I said, going into the bedroom, where my purple dress was still lying across the bed. I picked it up, carrying it to the closet. \u2018I\u2019ve just been working some things out.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And I, as well.\u2019 He coughed again. \u2018Look, I know you\u2019re there with Heidi, hearing her side of things \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Heidi wants you to come home.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018That\u2019s what I want, too,\u2019 he said. \u2018But it\u2019s just not that simple.\u2019</p><p>I pushed the dresses down the closet rod, the hangers clacking against each other, and stuffed the purple dress back in. Instead of shutting it, though, I kept moving through the line, looking at the other things there. I asked, \u2018Then what is it?\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019</p><p>I pulled another black dress out, this one with a pleated skirt, then shoved it back. \u2018You keep saying that, how it\u2019s not simple. So tell me what it is, then.\u2019</p><p>I could feel his surprise, tangible, which I guess shouldn\u2019t have been that shocking itself. He was used to me chalking up whatever decisions he made to a peculiar kind of logic, all his own. It excused so much: it excused everything. He was a writer, he was moody, he was selfish. He needed his sleep, he needed his space, he needed his time. If he\u2019d kept himself apart from the rest of the world, these things would have been just quirky annoyances, nothing more. But that was just the thing. He did involve other people. He reached out, drew them close. He made children with them, who then also could not separate themselves, whether they were babies or almost adults. You couldn\u2019t just pick and choose at will when someone depended on you, or loved you. It wasn\u2019t like a light switch, easy to shut on or off. If you were in, you were in. Out, you were out. To me, it didn\u2019t seem complicated at all. In fact, it was the simplest thing in the world.</p><p>\u2018See,\u2019 my dad said now, \u2018this is what I meant when I said you were angry. You\u2019ve heard Heidi talking, and you\u2019ve only gotten one side of the story.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s not why I\u2019m upset with you,\u2019 I told him, pushing more dresses aside. There was something so satisfying in the sound of the hangers clacking, all those colors blurring past. Pink, blue, red, orange, yellow. Each one like a shell, a skin, a different way to be, even if only for a day.</p><p>\u2018Then what is it?\u2019 he asked.</p><p>Black, green, black, polka dot. \u2018It\u2019s just,\u2019 I said, \u2018you have the opportunity for a second chance here.\u2019</p><p>\u2018A second chance,\u2019 he repeated.</p><p>\u2018Yeah,\u2019 I said. Short-sleeved, long-sleeved, narrow skirt, full. \u2018But you won\u2019t even take it. You\u2019d rather just quit.\u2019</p><p>He was quiet, the only sound the hangers sliding. I was almost to the end now, the choices narrowing to few, then fewer still. \u2018Is that what you think?\u2019 he said slowly. \u2018That I\u2019m quitting on you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Not on me,\u2019 I said.</p><p>\u2018On who, then?\u2019</p><p>And then, suddenly, there it was. A simple black dress with tiny beads hanging from the skirt, matching those along the neckline. A dancing dress, a flapper dress. The perfect dress, the one I\u2019d been looking for all along. And as I stared at it, I found something else as well. The answer to his question, and the reason, I realized suddenly, why this summer had brought so much of this to the surface.</p><p>\u2018Isby,\u2019 I told him.</p><p>When I said her name, I saw her face. Squawking, cooing, wailing, drooling. Sleeping, wakeful, fussy, content. The first day I\u2019d seen her, asleep in Heidi\u2019s arms, and how she\u2019d been only seconds ago, her eyes following me as I left the room. All these little parts of her, just the very beginning of who she would and could be. It was early yet. She had everything ahead of her, and more than anything, I hoped that she wouldn\u2019t need a lot of second chances. That maybe, unlike so many of us, she\u2019d find a way to get it right the first time.</p><p>\u2018Isby?\u2019 my dad repeated. \u2018You mean the baby?\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s what I call her,\u2019 I told him. \u2018That\u2019s who she is to me.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was quiet for a moment. Then he said, \u2018Auden, I love Thisbe. I\u2019d do anything in the world for her, or for you. You have to know that.\u2019</p><p>This was what my mother had said, too, only moments earlier, and I\u2019d chosen to believe her. So why was this so much harder? Because my mom had come to me. Traveled all this way, taken that risk, retraced some, if not all, of her steps to get us back to a place where we could, hopefully, forge a new path together. My dad was still in the same spot, and as always, he wanted me to come to him. Like I\u2019d done at the beginning of the summer, in this house, and at home as well. Always crossing that distance, crossing town, accommodating, making excuses.</p><p>\u2018If that\u2019s true,\u2019 I said to him, \u2018then prove it.\u2019</p><p>He was quiet for a moment. Then he said, \u2018How am I supposed to do that?\u2019</p> <p>Sometimes, you get things right the first time. Others, the second. But the third time, they say, is the charm. Standing there, a quitter myself, I figured I\u2019d never know if I didn\u2019t get back on that bike, one last time. So instead of replying, I pulled the black beaded dress from the closet, draping it across the bed. \u2018You figure it out,\u2019 I told him. \u2018There\u2019s something I have to do.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019d planned to drive. In fact, I\u2019d had my keys in hand as I ran out the door, the black dress swishing around my knees. But then, I saw the bike, sitting right against the steps where I left it, and the next thing I knew, I was climbing on. I raised up on the pedals, tried to remember everything Maggie had taught me over the last few weeks, and then pushed off before I could change my mind.</p><p>It was weird, but as I started down the front walk \u2013 wobbling slightly, but upright at least so far \u2013 all I could think of was my mom. When I\u2019d hung up the phone moments earlier, I\u2019d pulled on the dress and found my flip-flops and bag, figuring I\u2019d put Isby in the stroller and take her with me. But as I started to strap her in, hurriedly explaining myself to my mom, the baby started to fuss. Then cry. Then scream.</p><p>\u2018Oh, no,\u2019 I said as her face flooded with color. I knew the signs of a full-out fit when I saw one. \u2018This is not good.\u2019</p><p>\u2018She doesn\u2019t like the stroller?\u2019 asked my mom, who was standing behind me.</p> <p>\u2018Usually she loves it. I don\u2019t know what the problem is.\u2019 I bent down, adjusting the straps, but Isby just yelled louder, now kicking her feet for emphasis. I glanced up at my mom. \u2018I better just stay here. She\u2019s really unhappy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nonsense.\u2019 She gestured for me to move aside, then leaned over, undoing the straps and lifting Isby up. \u2018I\u2019ll watch her. You go have fun.\u2019</p><p>I did not mean for my expression to be so doubtful. Or shocked. But apparently it was, because she said, \u2018Auden. I raised two children. I can be trusted with a newborn for an hour.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Of course you can,\u2019 I said quickly. \u2018I just... I hate to leave you with her when she\u2019s like this.\u2019</p><p>\u2018She\u2019s not like anything,\u2019 my mom said, pulling the baby closer to her and patting her back. Weirdly enough, before, when Isby had been googly and cheerful, it was clear she was uncomfortable, but now, amid the screaming, she looked completely at ease. \u2018She\u2019s just giving me a piece of her mind.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Are you sure you want to do this?\u2019 I said, raising my voice to be heard above the din.</p> <p>\u2018Absolutely. Go.\u2019 She put the baby over her shoulder, still patting. \u2018That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right,\u2019 she said, over the shrieking. \u2018Tell me everything you have to say.\u2019</p><p>I just stood there, watching as she started to pace the kitchen floor, rocking Isby in her arms. As she walked, she fell into a rhythm: step, pat, step, pat. The baby, over her shoulder, looked at me, her face still red, mouth open. But as the space increased between us, she began to quiet down. And down. And down, until all I could hear was my mother\u2019s footsteps. And then something else.</p><p>\u2018Shh, shh,\u2019 she was saying. \u2018Everything\u2019s all right.\u2019</p><p>Her voice was low. Soft. And with these last words, suddenly familiar in a way it had not been ever before. That voice I thought I\u2019d imagined or conjured: it was her, all along. Not a dream, or a mantra, but a memory. A real one.</p><p>Everything\u2019s all right, I thought now, as I bumped over the curb and onto the street. There was no traffic in the neighborhood, and I thought of all those mornings with Maggie, feeling her hand on the back of my seat, her footsteps slapping the pavement as she raced to keep up before giving me one last push \u2013 Go! \u2013 and I was on my own.</p><p>I just kept riding, shooting under streetlights and past mailboxes, the tires whizzing against the pavement. As I turned out of the neighborhood, I had the road to myself, all the way to the single stoplight where it ended at the beach.</p><p>It was the light I focused on, solid green, up ahead of me, as I pedaled faster, the fastest yet, my hair blowing back, the spokes of the tires humming. I\u2019d never gone so fast before, and it occurred to me that I should probably be scared, but I wasn\u2019t. On the other side of the light I could see the ocean, big and dark and vast, and I pictured myself hitting the sand and just keeping going, over the dunes and into the waves, the current the only thing strong enough to stop me. I was so immersed in this image, which was amazingly clear in my head, that I didn\u2019t see two things until I was right up on them: the banged-up Toyota truck sitting at the stoplight, and the curb right across from it.</p><p>I saw the truck first. Suddenly, it was just there, although I was positive there had been no traffic when I\u2019d looked only seconds earlier. And maybe it was a good thing that I hardly had time to process that it was, in fact, Eli\u2019s truck. Because the next second, the curb presented itself, and it needed my full attention.</p> <p>I was already zooming past Eli when I realized I had to make a decision: try to brake and turn and hope my crash was a small one, or keep going and try to jump the curb. If anyone else had been in that truck, I probably would have taken the first option. But it wasn\u2019t anyone else, and I knew \u2013 even in those dwindling seconds, when I could feel every bit of my blood rushing through my ears \u2013 that this was probably the best way to explain to him what I\u2019d tried to that morning at the shop. So I jumped.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t like what I\u2019d seen Maggie do that night at the park. Or the tons of bike videos I\u2019d watched over the last few weeks. But it didn\u2019t matter. For me, the feeling of rising up suddenly, suddenly being airborne \u2013 the tires spinning into nothing \u2013 was amazing. It was like a dream. Or maybe, like waking up from one. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It only lasted a few seconds, and then I was coming down hard, the bike hitting the pavement with a bang beneath me, even as it kept moving forward. I felt the shock all the way from my fingertips to my elbows as I tried to control the handlebars, hanging on for dear life as the tires skidded, trying to fall over sideways. This was the point where I\u2019d always given into the crash, squeezing my eyes shut as the garbage can or bushes came closer, closer, closer. But now, I kept them wide open and just held on, and after a spray of sand, I was somehow back upright, and moving on.</p><p>My hands were shaking as I carefully eased on my brake, feeling my pulse thudding in my temple. It was all so clear to me \u2013 the fast approach, spotting the curb, and launching up, up, up \u2013 and yet at the same time, I could not believe I\u2019d actually done it. In fact, it didn\u2019t even seem real until I circled around, still shaking, and saw Eli, who at some point had pulled over to the curb and gotten out of his truck and was now just standing there, staring at me.</p><p>\u2018Holy crap,\u2019 he said finally. \u2018That was awesome.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah?\u2019</p> <p>He nodded. \u2018And here I thought you couldn\u2019t ride a bike.\u2019</p><p>I smiled, then pedaled back toward him. It was only as I got closer that I noticed he was not in his usual jeans and T-shirt or hoodie, but wearing nice black pants, some vintage-looking shiny dress shoes, and a long-sleeved white shirt, untucked. \u2018I couldn\u2019t,\u2019 I said, coming to a stop beside him. \u2018Maggie taught me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018How to jump, too?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Um, no,\u2019 I said, feeling myself flush. \u2018I kind of winged that part, actually.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Really.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018You couldn\u2019t tell?\u2019</p><p>He looked at me for a moment. \u2018Actually,\u2019 he said, \u2018I could.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What gave me away? The look of pure terror on my face?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nope.\u2019 He leaned back on his heels. \u2018In fact, you didn\u2019t look scared at all.\u2019</p><p>\u2018How did I look?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Ready,\u2019 he replied.</p> <p>I considered this as I looked down at my bike. \u2018Yeah,\u2019 I said. \u2018I think I was, actually.\u2019</p><p>Maybe this should have felt strange, especially after all that had happened. But it didn\u2019t. Perhaps because it was nighttime, when things that might have felt odd in daylight instead seemed just right. Like riding a bike in a prom dress and crossing paths with only one person, and it\u2019s the only person you want to see.</p><p>If it was light out, I would have questioned more, second-guessed, started to overthink. But now, it seemed natural to turn to Eli and say, \u2018You were right, you know.\u2019</p><p>\u2018About what?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Me,\u2019 I said. \u2018How I always quit if I don\u2019t get something right the first time. It\u2019s been a big mistake.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So you believe in second chances now,\u2019 he said, clarifying.</p><p>\u2018I believe,\u2019 I said, \u2018in however many you might need to get it right.\u2019</p><p>Eli slid his hands back in his pockets. \u2018I\u2019m believing in that, too, actually. Especially today.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Really.\u2019</p><p>He nodded, then gestured to his truck behind him. \u2018So... you know how I said no to you earlier. When you asked about the prom.\u2019</p><p>I felt my face flush. \u2018I think I remember that, yeah.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I had this competition, in Roardale. I\u2019ve actually been back competing for a few weeks now.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know.\u2019</p><p>He looked surprised, which I had to admit I kind of liked, as it was so rare. \u2018How?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve been kind of keeping up with the standings,\u2019 I said. \u2018Online. So how\u2019d you do?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I won.\u2019</p><p>I smiled. \u2018That\u2019s great. So I guess you\u2019re back riding for real, now?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nope. I\u2019m done.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re quitting again?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Retiring,\u2019 he corrected me. \u2018As of today.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why?\u2019</p><p>He leaned back on his heels, looking down the dark street. \u2018I was planning to last year. You know, because I\u2019d gotten into the U, and wanted to go to school. But then...\u2019</p><p>I waited. Because with Eli, he was never trying to get you to finish for him. He always knew where he was going, even if it took a little while to get there.</p><p>\u2018... Abe died,\u2019 he said. \u2018And everything just stopped. But it wasn\u2019t how I wanted to go out, just dropping off the map like that.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You wanted to go out on top,\u2019 I said.</p><p>\u2018Or at least try to.\u2019 He reached up, pulling a hand through his hair. \u2018So I\u2019m sorry, about today. I wish I\u2019d explained better why I said no.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I understand,\u2019 I told him. \u2018It was just something you had to do.\u2019</p><p>He looked at me, his eyes so dark. \u2018Yeah,\u2019 he said. \u2018Exactly.\u2019</p><p>A car was driving up to the light now, its headlights moving across us. They paused, their turn signal ticking, before moving past. Then Eli looked me up and down, taking in my dress and my flip-flops. \u2018So,\u2019 he said. \u2018Where are you going?\u2019</p><p>\u2018To the prom,\u2019 I told him. \u2018You?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Same. Better late than never, right?\u2019 he said. \u2018Want a ride?\u2019</p><p>I shook my head. He raised his eyebrows, opening his mouth to respond, but before he could I reached out, taking his hand, and pulled him closer to me. Then I stood on tiptoes, bringing my lips to his. The kiss was slow and sweet, and while it was happening, I had that image again of us so small, standing in the middle of Colby, under that stoplight, as the entire town and world turned around us. And in that moment, if only for that moment, we were right where we were supposed to be.</p><p>I smiled at him as I stepped back, then up on my pedals again. He turned slowly in a circle, watching me as I slowly rode around him, once, twice, three times, like casting a spell.</p><p>\u2018So you don\u2019t want me to take you,\u2019 he said.</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 I replied. \u2018But I\u2019ll meet you there.\u2019</p><p>Chapter NINETEEN</p><p>The coffee in the Defriese cafeteria was good, but not great. It was covered by my meal plan, though, and the cups were bottomless. So I\u2019d learned to like it just fine.</p><p>I fit a travel lid onto my jumbo cup, then pushed out onto the quad, pulling my backpack over my shoulder with my free hand. Now that it was October it was getting colder, a chill to the air that made a warm drink that much more necessary. I climbed onto my bike, balancing my cup with one hand as I carefully rode back across the empty campus to my dorm, a light drizzle starting to fall just as I pulled up at the rack outside. By the time I got to my room, I could hear the rain pinging off the windows. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Hey,\u2019 Maggie said, peering down at me from the top of our loft as I came in, shaking off my windbreaker. \u2018I thought you\u2019d already taken off.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Not yet,\u2019 I told her. \u2018I had a couple of last things to do.\u2019</p><p>She yawned, leaning back on her bed. \u2018Oh, your phone was ringing,\u2019 she said. \u2018A couple of times, actually.\u2019</p><p>I sat down on my bed, putting my coffee down on the milk crate I used as a bedside table. In addition to my alarm clock, it also held a stack of books and the contents of Heidi\u2019s latest care package: two bath bombs, a lip gloss, and a brand-new pair of Pink Slingback jeans. I hadn\u2019t had use for any of them yet, but still, I appreciated the gesture.</p> <p>Also on my table was my THE BEST OF TIMES picture frame Hollis had given me, all those months ago. I\u2019d forgotten about it until the day I was packing to leave for school, when I realized that I finally had something I could actually put in it. But I couldn\u2019t decide if I should use a shot from the prom, or one of the several I\u2019d taken with Maggie, Esther, and Leah in our last days in Colby. Maybe, I thought, I should use the one of me with Hollis and Laura, the day they officially announced their engagement. I had so many choices that in the end, I just chose to leave it empty until I was absolutely sure. Because maybe, the best of times were yet to come. You never knew.</p><p>There was one picture I did like to keep close at hand, but it wasn\u2019t of me. Instead, I preferred Isby\u2019s face to be the first one I saw when I rolled over in the morning. I\u2019d been surprised by how hard it had been to leave her at the end of the summer. My last day, we\u2019d sat together for over an hour, her asleep on my shoulder as we rocked in the chair in her room. Her warm skin, damp weight, that smell of milk and baby: I could still remember it so easily, as well as all the things I\u2019d whispered in her ear about her, and me, and this world of girls and boys we were both just one small part of. Someday, she\u2019d be able to tell me everything she knew, too. I couldn\u2019t wait.</p><p>In the meantime, I had one other thing to remind me of her. I\u2019d seen it at the local Park Mart during one of my first trips out after coming to school, and without even thinking I\u2019d tossed it into my cart. I was lucky to have Maggie as a roommate for an endless number of reasons. But the fact that she could tolerate the sound of waves once in a while \u2013 especially fake ones \u2013 was at the top of the list.</p><p>Now, I picked up my phone, scrolling though my missed calls. Sure enough, there were two. One from my mom, who called regularly, presumably to discuss my studies, although we usually got onto other topics pretty quickly these days. Like Laura and Hollis\u2019s wedding, which was making her insane \u2013 although she was trying to keep an open mind, she swore \u2013 or her slowly growing relationship with Finn, the graduate student with the black-rimmed glasses. He was sweet and funny, and adored my mother. How she felt about him was harder to say. Although I\u2019d been working with her, so that when she was ready to talk about it, she\u2019d be able to.</p><p>The second message was from my dad. He was back at home with Heidi, giving it another shot, a decision he\u2019d made the night of the prom, when he elected not to catch his flight but come over to watch Isby instead. Something about finding my mother walking the floor, soothing her, struck a chord with him, the very image able to convey all the things that I hadn\u2019t been able to. He\u2019d sent my mom back to her hotel and sat with Isby until late that night, when Heidi arrived home, shoes in hand, all abuzz from the Beach Bash. While the baby slept, they talked. And talked.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t come home right away. It was a slow process, with a lot of negotiations, and things had changed. Heidi was back at the store part-time, and my dad had dropped to teaching only one course, so they could each work but still have time with the baby. The days neither of them could be home, Isby stayed with either Karen, Eli\u2019s mom \u2013 who always liked a bit of baby time \u2013 or one of a few Weymar coeds who loved the extra perk of free clothes from Clementine\u2019s. My dad was still trying to sell his novel, but in the meantime, he\u2019d started a new book, one that was about the \u2018dark underbelly of parenthood and suburbia\u2019. He only had time to write late at night, but despite the less than nine hours, it seemed to suit him. Plus, he was always up for a chat if I was pulling an all-nighter as well.</p><p>I slid my phone into my pocket, then picked up my bag and coffee. \u2018I\u2019m out of here,\u2019 I said to Maggie.</p><p>\u2018See you tomorrow,\u2019 she replied. \u2018Oh, wait, I won\u2019t, actually. I\u2019m going to Colby.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You are?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah. It\u2019s the grand reopening, remember? Oh, I meant to tell you, Adam sent a T-shirt for you. It\u2019s over on your bureau.\u2019</p><p>I couldn\u2019t believe I\u2019d forgotten. Especially since whenever Adam had come to visit \u2013 at least every other weekend \u2013 it was all he could talk about. He\u2019d taken over managing the shop in the fall, juggling it with his part-time class schedule at Weymar, and he was completely excited about how Clyde was letting him make changes, get in new stock, really spruce the place up. New signs, new specials, new everything. There had been one holdover from the previous manager though, one last thing he needed to do, which I saw when I picked up the shirt, unfolding it.</p> <p>\u2018Abe\u2019s Bikes,\u2019 I read off the front. \u2018It does have a nice ring to it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t you think?\u2019 she replied, sticking her head over the edge to look down at me again. \u2018God, but Adam\u2019s a nervous wreck. He\u2019s freaking out that everything has to be perfect, and of course things keep going wrong. I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s going to have a nervous breakdown if anything else screws up.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nah,\u2019 I said. \u2018But if it does, just tell him I said to get back on the bike.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019</p><p>\u2018He\u2019ll understand.\u2019</p><p>I waved at her, then pulled my bag over my shoulder as I made my way down the hallway, then the stairs, to my car. It was just after five, and the sun was going down. By the time I got off the interstate two hours later and pulled into the parking lot of Ray\u2019s, it had already been dark for a while.</p><p>I cut the engine, then sat there for a second, looking in at the bright lights and shiny tables. Ray\u2019s was no Washroom, but the waitresses were nice, and you could sit as long as you wanted. Which was a good thing, when it was late and you had no other options, the way I had been when I\u2019d first discovered it. Now, I had plenty, but one big reason to be here just the same. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>I found him at table four, our favorite, the one in the corner by the window. Mug in his hand, slice of pie, half-eaten, by his elbow, totally immersed in the textbook in front of him. This semester he was taking an insane number of hours at the U, playing catch-up for the year he\u2019d missed, and it had been tough for him at first, going back to school. Kind of new, definitely scary. But luckily, I knew all about inside things like this, and was more than happy to help him on his quest, one paper and test at a time.</p><p>I bent down, kissing his forehead, and he looked up at me and smiled. Then I slid in opposite him as the waitress approached, filling the mug beside me. As I picked it up, it was warm in my hands, and I felt his hand move onto my knee. Morning would come before we knew it. It always did. But we still had the night, and for now, we were together, so I just closed my eyes and drank it all in.</p>   </body></html>"]
