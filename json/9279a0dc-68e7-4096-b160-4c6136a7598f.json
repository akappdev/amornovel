It didn\u2019t start at the airport, or at Gretl\u2019s house, or even the few days I spent sightseeing around St. Andras, the little town in Austria where my cousin Gretl lived. No, it started with an inquiry about nipples, and since I\u2019m determined to set this all down for posterity, I will do my best to record exactly what happened.</p><p>It\u2019s certainly the oddest thing I\u2019ve ever lived through, but I probably shouldn\u2019t mention that, because according to the creative writing class I took seven years ago, that\u2019s considered foreshadowing, and it\u2019s a grave sin when trying to explain how events came about. I\u2019ll stick to just what happened without the benefit of hindsight from here on out, I promise.</p> <p>Shoot, now I\u2019ve forgotten where... Oh, the nipple tattoos.</p><p>\u201cEr...\u201d I blinked in surprise at the polite inquiry made by a spiky-haired woman in a short Lolita skirt and a red and white striped vinyl PVC corset that I was willing to bet made her sweat like crazy. \u201cI don\u2019t think... On the nipple? That has to be impossible, not to mention beyond painful and into the land of downright insane.\u201d</p><p>The woman shrugged, dusting off a black leather barber\u2019s chair with a small cloth. \u201cIt\u2019s a personal statement that cannot be denied by all who see it. I thought perhaps since Madame was staring at the photos, Madame might be interested in one for herself.\u201d The woman\u2019s light gray eyes cast an assessing glance toward my chest. \u201cSince perhaps Madame feels a need to emphasize what she has.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well, Madame may not have big boobs, but she isn\u2019t into pain at all, especially on her nipples. I wasn\u2019t staring at the photos of your past customers,\u201d I added, avoiding looking at the various shots of newly pierced and tattooed customers that bedecked one wall of the small stall. \u201cI was intrigued by that bust you have in the back. It\u2019s a phrenologist\u2019s head, isn\u2019t it? The kind used in the last century to illustrate the meaning of the bumps on people\u2019s heads?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It belongs to Justinia, my partner. She is in Salzburg tonight, but will return tomorrow if you wish to have her read your head.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m a photographer.\u201d I held up my small Nikon. \u201cAmateur, but I hope to take enough photos while I\u2019m spending the summer here in Austria to start a new career, and I just love the setting of that phrenologist\u2019s head. Would you mind if I took a few pictures of it?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged again, gesturing with a lazy hand at the back of the booth. \u201cAs Madame desires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you guys going to be here for long? The...uh...sideshow, I mean?\u201d I asked, taking a few preliminary shots before digging out one of my filters to add a more stark look to the image.</p><p>\u201cThe GothFaire is not a sideshow. It is a traveling fair featuring feats of magic as well as vendors purveying many curiosities and fantastical services that you will not find anywhere else in the world,\u201d the woman answered in a faintly singsong Scandinavian accent. \u201cWe are not freaks or desperate attention seekers. We are learned in lore that has long been hidden from common knowledge. We are artisans, dealers in magic, granters of the most unlikely fantasies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, all that in one little traveling fair,\u201d I murmured as I moved to the side to get another series of shots with a second filter.</p><p>\u201cWe are unique. Madame will find nothing like us anywhere else in the world. Here are mystics and philosophers, magicians and conjurers of the ethereal.\u201d</p> <p>I had doubts that a tattoo and piercing artist could be described as ethereal, especially when viewed in relation to one\u2019s nipples, but kept that thought to myself, instead murmuring inconsequential comments as I satisfied my need to capture on film the fascinating old bust.</p><p>\u201cIo? You\u2019re not thinking of getting something pierced, are you?\u201d</p><p>I turned to smile at the middle-aged woman who stood clutching a plastic carrier bag, her eyes wide and wary. \u201cNo, this kind lady was letting me photograph her phrenologist\u2019s head.\u201d</p><p>The spiky-haired vendor eyed first Gretl, my second cousin, whom I\u2019d known since I was a small child, then me. \u201cI can offer a discounted price for more than one tattoo, if Madame\u2019s friend would care to join her. I am happy to do a tattoo of a more intimate nature, if that is desired. I am told that my work on labias is unparalleled.\u201d</p><p>Gretl\u2019s eyes widened even more. I took her by the arm and steered her away from the tattoo artist, saying as we left, \u201cI appreciate the offer, but I never jump into something without thinking it through, and that includes tattoos on my naughty parts. Thanks again for letting me have pictures of your partner\u2019s head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know that woman?\u201d Gretl asked as we moved down the center aisle of the fair. She cast a glance over her shoulder, as if she was worried the tattooist was going to chase us down and force us to get vagina tats.</p><p>\u201cNot at all. But she was interesting, don\u2019t you think? Well, this whole place is interesting. How did you hear about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn old friend of mine works here. I went to see if she was here, but her booth was closed. The Wiccan lady next to her told me that she was off shopping, though, and she should be back any time. What would you like to do while we wait for her?\u201d Gretl stopped and looked around.</p> <p>I looked with her. The GothFaire itself consisted of two rows of booths set up in a U shape and a large main tent standing at the bottom. Flyers rippling in the breeze proclaimed that two bands would be playing later in the evening, but a couple of magic shows were scheduled earlier. I glanced at my watch. \u201cI\u2019d love to see the magic acts, but those don\u2019t start for an hour. How about we check out the palm reader? Or they have some sort of aura-photography thing. That might be fun. I wonder what sort of camera tricks they use to give people auras? Maybe I could examine their setup and figure it out.\u201d</p><p>Gretl laughed and nudged my hand, which was still holding my camera. \u201cTrust you to want to see the photography booth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here, after all,\u201d I said lightly, gesturing down the length of the fair to where a booth with a giant eyeball was painted on a wooden sign.</p><p>\u201cYou are here to recover from recent events in your life, nothing more,\u201d Gretl said firmly, stopping me when I began to protest. \u201cI would never be able to look myself in the face if I made you work while you were staying with me. You relax. You rest. You get your feet under you again, and then you will return to the States and find yourself a new job\u2014a better one, one that will not have an employer who tries to grope you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could have handled Barry\u2019s octopus hands if it had just been that, but when he found out I filed a sexual harassment charge, he cooked a few accounts to make it look like I messed up. Lying, despicable, boob-grabbing bastard.\u201d I took a deep breath, reminding myself that I had two and a half long months to get over losing my job and my apartment in the same week. A new home shouldn\u2019t be too hard to find, although this time I\u2019d make sure the owner of the building didn\u2019t plan on selling it out from underneath all his tenants. \u201cAnd photography is relaxing to me, Gretl. This is going to be the best summer I\u2019ve had since...well, since the last time I spent the summer with you.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cYou were sixteen then. Much has changed in St. Andras in that time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt still seems to be the same cute little Austrian town to me.\u201d I nodded over her head to where a ruined castle perched on a hill. \u201cPicturesque as hell, and so charming I probably won\u2019t want to go back home at the end of the summer, just like I didn\u2019t when I was sixteen. Have I told you that you\u2019re the best cousin ever for inviting me to stay with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and I have an ulterior motive, you know,\u201d she answered, pushing me along the line of booths. \u201cNow that Anna is married, I have the empty tree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmpty nest? Yes, I suppose you do. But it\u2019s not like you don\u2019t have a lot going on in your life, what with your yoga classes and that program for encouraging new artists that you were telling me about on the way here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPfft. I am never too busy for family. Oh, look! Imogen is back. That is my old friend. I have known her for, oh, over thirty years. You will like her\u2014she has a way about her that makes everyone very comfortable. Imogen!\u201d</p><p>Gretl hurried forward to where a tall, elegant woman with long curly blond hair was arranging bowls of small polished rocks on a black velvet tablecloth. I followed slowly in order to give Gretl time to greet her friend. The woman turned and Gretl checked for a moment.</p><p>\u201cGretl? Can it be you?\u201d The blonde started toward Gretl with a surprised but welcoming smile.</p><p>\u201cYes, it is me,\u201d my cousin answered, her voice sounding odd. \u201cBut you! You have not changed since the last time I saw you more than twelve years ago. How is this? What magical face cream are you using to look so young?\u201d</p><p>Imogen laughed, but the lines around her eyes were stark rather than happy. Her complexion was pale, normal for blondes, but it struck me that she was a little too pale, as if she was under a great strain. \u201cIt is nothing but genetics, I\u2019m afraid. You, however, look as wonderful as you did when we last met! And you are a grandmother! It must be all those yoga classes about which you wrote to me.\u201d</p><p>The two ladies hugged, and I was pleased for Gretl\u2019s sake to see genuine affection in her friend\u2019s blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cI do not look even close to wonderful, but I am content as I am,\u201d Gretl said as she released Imogen. \u201cNow I must introduce to you my cousin from the States. Iolanthe, this is Imogen Slovik. Iolanthe is staying with me for the summer.\u201d</p><p>We murmured pleasantries and shook hands. \u201cYou are being a tourist?\u201d Imogen asked a few minutes later when she and Gretl had caught up on the most immediate of news. \u201cAre you traveling around Austria, or staying in St. Andras?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little of each. I\u2019m using this break as kind of a working holiday,\u201d I said, holding up my camera. \u201cI\u2019m trying to make a start in the photography world, so right now I\u2019m poking around St. Andras looking for interesting locations. Luckily, there\u2019s a lot to choose from here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere are many lovely sites in this region,\u201d Imogen agreed.</p><p>I eyed her. There was an air of fragility about her that intrigued me, and I wondered if there was any way I could capture that on film. She was certainly lovely enough to model, but a sense of tension seemed to wind around her, as if she were only just being kept from fracturing into a million pieces. It prompted me to ask, \u201cWould you... This is going to sound awfully presumptuous, but would you be willing to let me take a few pictures of you? I can\u2019t pay you, I\u2019m afraid, but I\u2019d be happy to give you copies of any of the prints you want.\u201d</p><p>Imogen looked startled for a moment before smiling. \u201cHow very sweet of you. It\u2019s been...oh, so long I can\u2019t even remember when someone has asked to take my photo. I would be delighted to, although we are only in St. Andras for five days. We are taking a bit of a holiday, you see, and keeping only short hours for the fair until we move on.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell...\u201d I glanced at the skyline. It was dusk, and a dark purple had started to creep across the sky from the inky black silhouette of the mountains. \u201cI know you\u2019re busy tonight with your pretty stone things\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRune stones,\u201d she interrupted, touching with reverence a deep purple stone bearing an etched symbol on one side. \u201cI have an affinity for them, although I do occasionally read palms, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Rune stones. Interesting.\u201d</p><p>She flipped a long curl over her shoulder. \u201cRight now Fran is doing palm reading because she and Benedikt are...er...helping here at the fair. Benedikt is my brother,\u201d she added, turning to Gretl. \u201cDo you remember meeting him in Vienna that time in the 1990s?\u201d</p><p>Gretl\u2019s round face lit up, a faint blush pinkening her cheeks. \u201cWho could forget him? He was absolutely gorgeous. And he\u2019s here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, with Francesca. They were married a few months ago. You\u2019ll like Fran\u2014she\u2019s very sweet, and she absolutely adores Benedikt, although she teases him mercilessly about the fact that women are prone to swooning over him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. He must still be quite the looker. You guys must have some really great genes,\u201d I commented before steering the conversation back to where I wanted it. \u201cI know you\u2019re busy tonight, but perhaps I could shoot you tomorrow, if you are free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBenedikt is very handsome, yes,\u201d Imogen answered, ignoring my attempts to steer her. \u201cHe resembles our father in that way.\u201d</p><p>The sense of tension in her increased, and I noticed she glanced over my shoulder, a flicker of pain passing across her face.</p><p>\u201cYour father must have been a very handsome man, then,\u201d Gretl said with a dreamy look in her eyes that made me want to giggle. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you\u2019ve ever mentioned him before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe died when I was twenty-two,\u201d Imogen said swiftly, her gaze now on the stones that she stroked with long, sensitive fingers. \u201cHe was destroyed by his two half brothers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, how horrible!\u201d both Gretl and I said.</p><p>\u201cIt was very tragic. He inherited our family home, and they obviously coveted that, so they lured him into a forest one summer night and destroyed him.\u201d She stopped, obviously hesitant to go on. \u201cIt is why I am here, as a matter of fact. The anniversary of his...death...is a few days from now. I try to make a pilgrimage to this area whenever I can, to remember happier times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I said as Gretl murmured sympathetic platitudes. \u201cI should never have brought up the subject of genes.\u201d</p><p>She sniffed back a few unshed tears. \u201cNo, no, I don\u2019t mind talking about Papa. Before that horrible night, he was a good man, an excellent father, and I loved him very dearly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must miss him terribly. I assume they caught his killers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey disappeared before they could be tried, unfortunately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so sad. But I\u2019m sure that wherever your father is, he knows how much you loved him.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at me, her eyes wide with surprise. \u201cWherever he is?\u201d</p> <p>I gestured toward the sky. \u201cYou know, looking down on you.\u201d I had no idea what religion, if any, she subscribed to, so I didn\u2019t want to be too specific in my attempt to provide her with a little comfort.</p><p>Imogen gave a delicate little shrug, returning her gaze to the stones. \u201cAh. Yes, I\u2019m sure he does. At one time I had hope that Ben and I would find Nikola\u2019s brothers, but we were unable to do so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNikola is your father?\u201d I couldn\u2019t help but ask. I didn\u2019t want to be nosy, but my curiosity got the better of me, and she honestly didn\u2019t seem to mind talking about him, so long as we kept off the subject of his manner of death.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She set down a stone she was stroking and looked up again at us, a little smile lighting her pure blue eyes. \u201cNikola Czerny, the fifth Baron von Shey.\u201d</p><p>I blinked at her. \u201cYour dad was a baron? A real baron? Does that make you anything?\u201d</p><p>She laughed aloud, patting my arm for a second. \u201cYes, it makes me a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d I apologized again, blushing a little at the stupidity that had emerged from my mouth. \u201cYou have to excuse me\u2014I\u2019m an idiot. But I\u2019ve never met someone who was from the aristocracy before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of the nobility lost their power in Austria almost a hundred years ago,\u201d Gretl said gently, giving me a little squeeze on my arm. \u201cAlthough I, too, did not know that Imogen\u2019s father was a baron. The title passed to Ben?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it didn\u2019t,\u201d Imogen said, her expression darkening for a moment before she gave us both a bright smile. \u201cIt was all a long time ago, and we have much more pleasant things to speak of, yes?\u201d</p><p>It was a not very subtle hint that she was through talking about the subject.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Gretl said soothingly, and made a date for the next afternoon to have tea and pastries.</p><p>\u201cI hate to bother you if you\u2019re busy,\u201d I said, not sure whether she had responded to my request for a photo session because she was polite or because she really wanted me to take some pictures of her. \u201cIf so, then I will totally understand. But if not, I\u2019m sure we can find somewhere locally that would make a good backdrop.\u201d</p><p>Imogen looked up with a genuine smile. \u201cNo, I am not too busy. I would love to be your model.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you must go to Andras Castle!\u201d Gretl said, clasping my arm. \u201cIt would make a lovely setting\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Imogen said quickly, her expression as brittle as ice. I blinked at the change in her demeanor. She suddenly relaxed and gave a forced little laugh. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. You must think me very odd, but Andras Castle holds...bad memories for me. I would prefer not to go there again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course we won\u2019t use it,\u201d I reassured her, curious at such a strong reaction to a ruined castle. Perhaps she\u2019d been frightened there\u2014when Gretl had told me about the ruins, she said that it had a bad reputation by the locals as being unpleasant to visit. \u201cThere are lots of other places around here we could use.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe rose gardens?\u201d Gretl suggested. \u201cThe town hall? The church? It is quite old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm...\u201d I scrunched up my nose as I thought. \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019d like to try something a little different as a backdrop for Imogen. Something to contrast with all that fair delicacy.\u201d</p><p>Imogen laughed, her expression once again changing like quicksilver. \u201cI\u2019m sure you meant that as a compliment, but I assure you, I am anything but delicate. Fair, yes\u2014I got that from my mother. But delicate? No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAppearances are often deceiving,\u201d I agreed. \u201cI think I\u2019d like to see you set against somewhere dark and gritty. That would make for some wonderful depth to the picture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you like. You\u2019re the expert,\u201d Imogen said with another of her little shrugs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m far from that, but I see you...\u201d I narrowed my eyes and thought about an image of Imogen against the ruined castle. That would have been ideal, but there were other places that I could use. \u201cOh! Gretl told me about this haunted forest near here\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Imogen all but squawked, drawing attention from the people moving past us. She shot them a reassuring smile before turning it on me. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. You must think me terribly emotional, but if you are talking about the Zauberwald, the woods near Andras Castle, then I must again say no. It is not a good place, that forest. I will not step foot in it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to suggest somewhere that would make you feel uncomfortable.\u201d I thought for a moment. \u201cI don\u2019t really know many places around here, but surely there must be some other location we can use that would give the same sense of\u2014oh, I don\u2019t know\u2014something otherworldly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOtherworldly? Yes, of course I can do that.\u201d She shot me a startled glance that quickly turned speculative, then amused, as if we shared a secret, something that struck me as hugely odd. I had only just met her\u2014how could we share a secret? When Gretl turned to greet an acquaintance who had called her name, Imogen leaned over to me, saying with a little nod at Gretl\u2019s back, \u201cI had no idea you were not mundane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr...\u201d Mundane? Was she making a dig at Gretl? I bristled righteously in defense of a much-loved cousin. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought of myself as something...different, but just because Gretl chose a more traditional path in life doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not a wonderful person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course she\u2019s wonderful. She\u2019s been my friend for many years.\u201d Imogen smiled and squeezed my arm briefly. \u201cAnd we all feel different at some time or other, don\u2019t we? At least until we settle in with our own kind. But who exactly are you? I realize it is rude to just come right out and ask you, but I\u2019m sure you do not wish to speak of your true nature in front of dear Gretl.\u201d</p><p>I blinked at her, once again taken aback and unsure of how to respond, but luckily Gretl finished her chat and turned back to us, so I was content to simply smile in answer to Imogen\u2019s wink, and made a mental note to ask Gretl or her eldest daughter, Erica, to accompany me on the photo shoot. It was becoming clear that Imogen was a few apples shy of spiced cider. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, there are Benedikt and Fran. Come. I must introduce you both to them. Benedikt will be delighted to see you again, Gretl.\u201d</p><p>I followed as Imogen bustled off with Gretl in tow over to where a tall man with shoulder-length black hair stood with a woman who was almost as tall as he was. The woman, who faced me, looked to be in her early twenties.</p><p>\u201cWell, now, that\u2019s interesting,\u201d I murmured, eyeing the woman named Fran. No matter how good Imogen looked, she had to be nearing fifty for Gretl to have known her for thirty years. Which meant her brother was probably in his forties or fifties, too, or he was a whole lot younger than Imogen. \u201cEven if there is a big age difference,\u201d I said as I strolled toward them, \u201che would be close to my age.\u201d</p> <p>And yet his wife was probably twenty-two or twenty-three. I glanced at Gretl as the couple stepped forward to greet her. A puzzled frown pulled her brows together for an instant before she smiled, quickly returning to her usual charming self. When the man turned to greet me, I saw why Gretl had frowned. I stared at him for a moment, unable to believe what I was seeing. He was in his mid- to late twenties, at least ten years younger than me, which meant Imogen was old enough to be his mother. Not an unknown situation, but not a common one, either. I realized that everyone was staring at me as I gawked so obviously at Imogen\u2019s handsome, much, much younger brother, and I pulled my wits together.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I murmured, shaking first his hand, then Fran\u2019s. She gave me an amused glance before leaning into her husband, her arm around his waist in a possessive move that I\u2019d have had to be blind to miss.</p><p>I chuckled to myself, wanting to assure her that I might be single and not averse to finding a man, but I wasn\u2019t about to stoop to husband stealing and cradle robbing. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you both,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cIolanthe wishes to take my picture tomorrow,\u201d Imogen told her brother. \u201cShe is a photographer. She wishes to take me somewhere otherworldly.\u201d</p><p>The emphasis Imogen put on the word seemed to have some meaning for them, because they both raised their eyebrows for a few seconds. Ben slid a gaze to Gretl before returning it to me, saying in a low voice that couldn\u2019t have been heard by anyone but his wife, \u201cAre you with the Court of Divine Blood? I don\u2019t recognize what you are, but I\u2019m not very familiar with members of the Court.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a woman,\u201d I answered, ironically echoing Imogen\u2019s words as I moved a few steps away from him. Clearly there was some sort of mental instability in Imogen\u2019s family.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course you are,\u201d Fran said with a comforting smile that I didn\u2019t for one minute buy. Ben turned to answer a question Gretl asked him, leaving Fran chatting with me in a low voice. \u201cWhat Ben meant was what are you? You\u2019re not a therion or a Guardian or a Summoner. I\u2019ve seen those, and you don\u2019t look like them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to be an accountant,\u201d I told her, feeling that diplomacy was going to be my best bet if I wanted to get pictures of Imogen. It wouldn\u2019t do to offend any of Imogen\u2019s family by calling them crackpots. \u201cBut Barry, my boss, kept hitting on me, and when I tried to turn him in, he got me fired. Illegal and reprehensible, but true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I meant\u2014\u201d Fran stopped talking when Gretl turned back to us.</p><p>\u201cIo, you don\u2019t mind that Imogen has asked me to sit with her for an hour or so while she reads the rune stones, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. I\u2019ll just wander around the fair and see the sights.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take care of your cousin,\u201d Fran told Gretl as we moved off. I couldn\u2019t help but notice that Fran wore a pair of long black lace gloves that disappeared into her shirt cuffs. \u201cWe\u2019ll show you around and introduce you to all the people who work here. You might find someone you\u2019d like to photograph in addition to Imogen, you know. There are lots of interesting folks. My mother is\u2014 Ratsbane! What\u2019s he doing here?\u201d</p><p>Fran had been steering me down the center aisle when she suddenly froze and glared to the side, where a blond man with a short goatee was strolling toward us. The man also froze when he caught sight of us, an expression of joy on his face as he waved an arm in the air and bellowed, \u201cGoddess Fran! We have returned!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you said they\u2019d gone back to Valhalla?\u201d Ben asked in a tight, low voice.</p><p>\u201cThey had. Dammit, they promised me they wouldn\u2019t come back until I asked for their help again.... Excuse me a minute, Io. I have to deal with an old...friend....\u201d</p><p>She hurried off to the blond man, who was joined by a second man, who also enveloped Fran in a bear hug.</p><p>\u201cOh, Christ, not both of them,\u201d Ben said, rubbing a hand over his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to escort me around the fair, you know. I\u2019m quite capable of trotting around by myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d much rather show you around than deal with those two lunatics,\u201d he said, nodding toward the nearest booth. \u201cWhat would you like to see first? I can\u2019t vouch for the tattooing, but the demonologist is a friend of mine and can be quite interesting if he\u2019s holding a private group session.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine just people watching, if truth be told,\u201d I said politely, the hairs on the back of my neck standing on end. The words \u201cdemonologist\u201d and \u201cprivate session\u201d just seemed like an incredibly bad juxtaposition. \u201cPeople are so fascinating if you have the time to really study them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue words. I won\u2019t ask you any more about yourself, since I\u2019m sure Imogen will pump you for all the information you\u2019re willing to divulge,\u201d he said, laughter rich in his voice as we moved on at a slow amble. \u201cMy sister appreciates people watching, as well. Some might call her nosy, but in reality she just likes mortals.\u201d</p><p>Keep in the open, I told myself. Stay around other people. Do not, under any circumstances, go off anywhere alone with this bizarre man. \u201cI really am not all that interesting, I assure you. I do feel bad about my horrible foot-in-mouth disease with Imogen, though.\u201d</p><p>He paused in front of a booth dedicated to personal time travel, shooting me a curious look. \u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>I made a little face. \u201cI said I wanted to take photos of Imogen at the place your father met his end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father?\u201d Ben blinked. \u201cMy father is in South America.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d A blush warmed my face as I realized that once again I\u2019d verbally embarrassed myself. \u201cI thought you and Imogen had the same father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do. He\u2019s in Brazil, I believe. Or Argentina. Somewhere with lots of nearly naked young women and a high level of debauchery.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him in incomprehension. \u201cHe\u2019s not dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He leaned in close and said in a low voice, \u201cMy father is a Dark One. He can\u2019t die unless someone goes to quite a bit of trouble, and I can assure you that no one has done that in several centuries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeveral centuries,\u201d I repeated, just as if that weren\u2019t the least bit startling, although, of course, my brain was screaming at me to run far, far away from the crazy man.</p><p>And then the thought hit me\u2014what if Imogen and her brother were having me on? What if they were teasing me, the ignorant little American tourist? What if they were waiting to see me freak out, whereupon they\u2019d all have a good giggle at my expense?</p><p>The bastards. I wouldn\u2019t give them the pleasure!</p><p>\u201cWell...three hundred? That seems about right. I think it was in 1708 that he flipped out. So three hundred and a bit.\u201d</p><p>I may not have had a lot of pride left that wasn\u2019t in tatters after the smear campaign by Barry of the Many Hands, but what I did have I gathered around me. \u201cOh, that kind of Dark One. I thought you meant the...um...non-three-hundred-year type.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me as if potatoes had started a cabaret act on my head. \u201cThe what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, the kind that aren\u2019t around for three hundred years.\u201d</p><p>I think the potatoes may have begun a trapeze act, because the look he gave me was one of utter incredulity. That killed my idea of his pulling my leg\u2014people who were teasing you seldom bore that sort of expression when you sussed out what it was they were doing.</p><p>\u201cYou did say three hundred years, didn\u2019t you?\u201d I asked, suddenly worried that I misheard him. Maybe he had every right to look at me as if I was the odd one.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He continued to eye me. \u201cMy father is actually older than three hundred years. He\u2019s...let me see. I\u2019m three hundred and nineteen, which means he must be around three hundred and sixty. Or seventy. Somewhere around that age.\u201d</p><p>What do you say to a man who claims he\u2019s over three hundred years old? I don\u2019t know what you would say, but I decided that the best thing to do was to agree with him and try to get rid of him.</p><p>\u201cJust so. Those are my favorite kind of Black Ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDark Ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d I cleared my throat and tried to sidle away. \u201cI think I\u2019ll just\u2014\u201d</p><p>Ben evidently wasn\u2019t having any of it. He followed after me, giving me a curious look. \u201cThere are only two types of Dark Ones, Io\u2014redeemed and unredeemed. My father is the latter, naturally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally.\u201d I wondered whether if I dashed into the big main tent, he would come after me, or whether I could lose him in the crowd that was starting to gather.</p><p>\u201cAlthough he did love my mother. In his own fashion. It was only afterward that he lost the ability to feel any such emotions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you know how it is with Dark Dudes\u2014that happens.\u201d</p><p>He stopped me by taking hold of my arm, swinging me around to face him, his eyes narrowed on my face. \u201cYou do know what a Dark One is, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I lied, giving him what I hoped was a serene smile. \u201cThey\u2019re...um... They live a long time, and they...uh...hang out at fairs, and...er...do other stuff like...urm...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBeing vampires,\u201d a female voice said behind me.</p><p>Eyes wide with disbelief, I spun around to find Fran smiling over my shoulder at Ben.</p><p>\u201cSexy, sexy vampires,\u201d she added with a little sigh of pleasure.</p> <p>Panic hit me then, hard and hot in my gut. I looked around wildly for an escape, throwing to the wind my desire to photograph Imogen. There was no way on this green earth I was going to spend any more time with people who thought they were three-hundred-year-old vampires!</p><p>\u201cIo, let me introduce you to my ghosts. They\u2019re Vikings, and although they\u2019re supposed to be in Valhalla, they claim they were sent back to help Ben and me with a little project\u2014\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t wait for Fran to finish her sentence. I bolted, wanting nothing more than to escape the insanity that seemed to surround me.</p><p>July 11</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re all right on your own, Io?\u201d Gretl watched me for a few seconds, her brow furrowed. \u201cYou\u2019re not feeling ill, are you?\u201d</p> <p>I set my small camera bag on a smooth boulder just off the shoulder of the road, giving her a reassuring smile. \u201cI\u2019m not sick, and I\u2019ll be fine. I was just tired last night at the GothFaire, nothing more, but I\u2019m right as rain this morning.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lower lip, still eyeing me. \u201cYou were so distraught last night, insisting on returning home early.... If Imogen\u2019s brother said something to upset you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Like he was a three-hundred-year-old vampire? Oh yeah, that would do the job, but I would never admit to Gretl that her friends were wack jobs, since they obviously acted perfectly normal around her. I rubbed my bare arms against the chill of the memory of the previous evening. \u201cI told you that he didn\u2019t do anything. I was just having low biorhythms or something. I needed some rest, and as you can see, I\u2019m peachy keen today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d She glanced over my shoulder to the woods beyond, shivering a little at the sight. \u201cWhy you wish to come here to photograph when you know the area is said to be haunted...and it is where Imogen said her father was killed. I think maybe you should find somewhere else to take your photos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImogen may not want to be here\u2014not that I blame her if it has such a bad connotation for her family\u2014but there\u2019s no reason I can\u2019t take some pictures of the woods.\u201d</p><p>I turned to consider the dense growth of trees. I knew from perusing Gretl\u2019s map of the area that the forest was fairly small, probably under ten acres, and shaped roughly like an oval, lying between the town of St. Andras to the south, the castle to the north, and, to the east, a mountainous rise that curved to the neighboring town. To the west, the trees petered out, the land sloping down into the valley where the GothFaire was currently camped.</p> <p>\u201cI suppose not,\u201d Gretl said slowly, doubt evident on her face. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s so spooky. I would never go in there.\u201d</p><p>I had to admit, there was something about the woods that raised the fine hairs on the back of my neck, a sense of a place that wasn\u2019t quite in sync with the rest of the world. \u201cI think it\u2019s beautiful. I love fir and pine trees so densely packed together that you can see the sunlight streaming through their branches. That\u2019s an awesome look. See over there, just past that boulder shaped like a sleeping cat\u2014see how the sunlight pours through the tree like honey? And those vines, whatever they are, are like streamers of green and brown tangled through the lower branches of the trees, wafting down to the ground where they gently wave.\u201d I took a couple of steps forward, intrigued by the woods, studying the scene with a critical eye for composition, and finding nothing at fault. \u201cIt\u2019s the breeze that moves the vines, but honestly, Gretl, can\u2019t you imagine them as some form of sentient life, beckoning the unwary traveler into their midst, pulling you deeper and deeper into the cool, dark, mysterious heart of the woods until you find\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind what?\u201d Gretl\u2019s voice was at the same time hushed and high-pitched, but it was enough to break the spell that had gripped me.</p><p>A little shiver ran down my back at the thought of what lay in the heart of the forest. Then with a mental shake of my head at such fanciful thoughts I turned back to my cousin with an apologetic smile. \u201cMore woods, no doubt. I\u2019m sorry if I spooked you. I\u2019m normally a very feet-on-the-ground sort of person, but there\u2019s just something about those woods that makes me go emo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmo?\u201d She shivered and rubbed her arms again. \u201cEmotional?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t blame you. I don\u2019t like the woods, Io. They are bad, and I do not like you spending the day there. It is unnatural.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but don\u2019t you see, Gretl\u2014it\u2019s just that unnatural sense of an otherworld that I\u2019m seeking for my photos. Can\u2019t you envision a shot of Imogen set against it as a background? A little Photoshop magic, and voil\u00e0, I\u2019ll have a killer series of pictures that I just bet I can sell. Or at the very least, add to my portfolio.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you\u2019ll be all alone in there.\u201d Her brows were pulled together in worry as I collected my bag from the rock, removing from it my camera, which I slung around my neck on its strap. \u201cAren\u2019t you afraid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? No, I\u2019m a curious little kitty. I like to poke around mysterious sorts of places. Besides...\u201d I pulled from the bag a small canister the size of the palm of my hand. \u201cI have your pepper spray, so should there be any weirdos camping out in the forest who feel like attacking me, I\u2019ll be set. OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d she repeated, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cI know, but just wait until you see the pictures. They\u2019ll knock your socks off.\u201d I glanced at my watch. \u201cHow about you pick me up at six? Will your book group be done by then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, six will be fine. Io, be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise! Nothing will happen except I\u2019ll spend the day in the spooky woods getting bit by mosquitoes and taking tons of fabulously moody shots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope that is all you are bitten by,\u201d she said darkly, but, to my relief, got into her compact\u2014but expensive\u2014car and started it up.</p><p>I waved, straightened my navy and white print sundress, hoisted the camera bag, and with a deep breath started for the woods, musing on her words. \u201cShe hopes that\u2019s all I\u2019m bitten by?\u201d I shook my head as I left the warm sunshine and entered the coolness of the shade cast by the dense growth of trees, the pines filling the air with scent, while the sound of discarded needles crunched underfoot. \u201cLike what else would bite me? A vampire? Ha! I laugh at that.\u201d</p><p>I did laugh, but it came out strained and curiously flat, as if I was trying to convince myself.</p><p>\u201cI am so not afraid of trees and vines and the weird trick of light that makes it look like there are little sparkles of things floating in the air around here. It\u2019s just a small wood, nothing more.\u201d</p><p>The words were brave, but the sensation of closeness seemed to wrap around me, almost like an embrace, leaving the everyday sounds\u2014the noise of cars traveling on the road, the occasional airplane droning high overhead\u2014muffled and distant.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just muffled by the trees,\u201d I told myself as I pushed aside a long tendril of vine to march resolutely toward a particularly bright spot where light streamed through the branches. \u201cTrees do that to things. Even the normal stuff like birds and insects get damped down by the\u2014\u201d I stopped as I listened intently for a few seconds.</p><p>There was no birdsong, no whine of insects. There was no noise whatsoever except the muted rustle of the vines as they rubbed on the branches.</p><p>Just like they were alive and reaching for me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all that talk of vampires and Viking ghosts and haunted forests. That\u2019s what\u2019s making you scare the bejeepers out of yourself,\u201d I said with a nervous laugh, trying hard to shake off the feeling that everything around me was aware that I was in its midst. \u201cYou\u2019re not in a Tolkien book, Io, and there are no Ents around here to scare the snot out of you, so just mellow out and get down to business, or you\u2019ll have to explain to Gretl why you spent the entire day sitting on the rock next to the road because you scared yourself.\u201d</p><p>That little pep talk did the trick\u2014mostly\u2014and with a squaring of my shoulders, I walked resolutely toward the spot I wanted, and spent the next few hours snapping photos of it, and various other locations. There was a particularly magnificent outcropping of rock that rose some twelve feet in the air, almost like it was part of the ruined castle to the north, all covered in ferns and creepers, surrounded by budding little pine trees. I shot it from all angles, imagining in my head the composition of a series of pictures with Imogen set against it.</p><p>\u201cThis is going to be great,\u201d I said quietly to myself as I pushed deeper into the woods. The sunshine was less plentiful here, since the trees fought for space, their branches tangled and twisted together, making an effective fir canopy. The air was cooler, as well, and sharp with the scent of the trees and earth, enough that it made me shiver a little as I skirted another large boulder. Although I continued to speak aloud, more to bolster my own spirits than because I was of the habit of doing so, my voice had taken on a hushed quality normally confined to places such as churches or graveyards. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to get back to my laptop and see how they turned\u2014whoa. What the heck is that?\u201d</p><p>I plucked from my arm a vine that had somehow snagged me, and I slid between it and a massive pine tree to stop and squint at the object in the center of a small clearing about thirty feet in width. The ground rose slightly to the center, where a sort of cloud seemed to hang, slowly twisting and turning upon itself.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s not something you see every day,\u201d I said slowly, and shuffled forward a few feet to get a better look at it. It still looked like a cloud, faintly bluish black in color, just lingering over the spot at the top of the little rise. \u201cHow on earth...? Is there, like, a hot spring or something beneath here?\u201d</p><p>There didn\u2019t seem to be anything dangerous about the cloud, so with a glance around the clearing, I took a few shots of it from three different angles before approaching it, holding out my hand to feel any steam that might be leaking through a crack above a hot spring. My fingers brushed the edge of the cloud, making them tingle. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat is just the strangest thing....\u201d I held the camera to my eye and focused on one section of the cloud. It wasn\u2019t completely opaque, but the way it gently moved around on itself was not quite...well, normal. I reached out to touch it again. It wasn\u2019t hot at all, and studying the ground, I found no signs of disturbance, which let out my spring theory. I waved a hand through the cloud, swishing it around vigorously to see if it would dissipate.</p><p>Tendrils of the cloud broke off and evaporated into nothing, but the rest seemed to fill in the part that had been removed.</p><p>\u201cNational Geographic, here I come,\u201d I said, moving in a complete circle around it, photographing as I did so. \u201cThey\u2019re guaranteed to want these pictures, and even if it\u2019s just some sort of swamp gas\u2014on the side of a mountain, which is really weird if you ask me\u2014the results will be completely spectacular.\u201d</p> <p>A thought struck me then\u2014perhaps this was why the locals considered the area haunted? I lowered my camera and eyed the cloud with speculation.</p><p>\u201cIt certainly is a strange phenomenon, and I suppose if one was superstitious or the least bit prone to being weirded out by things, it would be possible to imagine that you are a ghost. But you\u2019re not a ghost. You\u2019re nothing but a cloud,\u201d I told the strange anomaly, moving closer to it in order to stick my arm entirely through it. \u201cI wonder if I can get a picture of just my arm coming through the other side?\u201d I adjusted the focus and leaned to the side to do just that, but at that moment, the ground beneath my feet seemed to shift, toppling me forward.</p><p>I shrieked and threw out my hands to catch myself before hitting the ground, swearing even as I did so when my camera flew out of my hands, leaving me to be completely swallowed up by an inky abyss.</p><p>Nothing surrounded me. At least, that\u2019s what it seemed like when I regained consciousness. I sat up, aware of throbbing in my head and mouth.</p><p>\u201cOw,\u201d I mumbled, sitting on my heels as I felt my mouth, pulling away my fingers to see if it was bleeding.</p> <p>I couldn\u2019t see them to tell if I had drawn blood. At that moment I realized that the visual fuzziness had nothing to do with me waking up, and everything to do with the fact that night had suddenly fallen. Right smack-dab in the middle of the day. I looked up to where stars glittered overhead with a cold silver blue light. \u201cHoly bizarre-o-rama, Batman,\u201d I said slowly, letting my gaze drop back down to the trees surrounding the little clearing.</p><p>The wind rustled through them, raising goose bumps along my bare arms, and sending a shiver skittering down my back. Ebony fingers stretched toward me, seeming to shimmer in the moonlight. I stood up slowly, feeling as if I\u2019d stepped through the looking glass into another world. \u201cOnly this isn\u2019t another world,\u201d I said aloud, my voice piercing the velvety quiet of the night. \u201cEverything is the same, except it\u2019s night. I must have hit my head and passed out. Oh, Gretl will be insane with worry....\u201d I spun around to find my camera bag, which held my cell phone and wallet, but the move was a bit too much for my still-dizzy brain. I staggered backward and tripped over a small rock, landing on my behind.</p><p>\u201cWhoa. OK. Slowly this time.\u201d I waited until the world stopped spinning and got to my feet again, brushing off my dress before carefully surveying what I could of the immediate area.</p><p>There was nothing but grass, dirt, pine needles, and the swirly bit of cloud that was now almost invisible in the darkness. \u201cIt has to be here. I set it down right before I started taking pictures.\u201d I tentatively felt around the ground. There was enough light from the moon to make out basic shapes, but nothing in the immediate area even remotely resembled a camera bag, or my camera.</p><p>\u201cOf all the...someone must have stolen it while I was passed out!\u201d Indignation filled me at such a thought, and gave me the spurt of adrenaline I needed to get moving. I was through the forest and heading for the road before I had the bulk of rude things I wanted to say worked out of my system. \u201cAnd so help me, if I ever catch the person who left me unconscious in the middle of the woods, they\u2019ll be one sad little panda. Hey. What happened to the road?\u201d</p><p>The pale silvery blue light of the moon made the grass verge appear sooty. I glared at the road. \u201cI don\u2019t remember you being a dirt road. I remember you being a normal paved road. What the hell is going on?\u201d</p> <p>Gingerly, I felt my head, braced for some sort of wound that would indicate I had hit it when I had fallen, but there was nothing there but normal, undamaged head. I took a deep, deep breath and, with only a few minor muttered imprecations, turned to the left and started walking down the (now dirt) road that wound down the hill and led to the town in the valley below.</p><p>I was on a flattish stretch that curved through some forest\u2014not the haunted one\u2014when I heard the dull rumble of thunder. \u201cOh, great, this is just what I need\u2014rain while I have to walk the three miles into town. Someone really does not like me today.\u201d</p><p>I increased my pace, hoping against hope that I\u2019d make it at least into town before the rain hit, muttering to myself about my spate of bad luck of late, and why that needed to change immediately. The sound of the thunder increased.</p><p>\u201cScrew this,\u201d I snarled, and sprinted down the road, bits of dirt worming their way into my sandals, grinding painfully against my soles. Despite the slight decline of the road, I ran like crazy, my eyes on the lights of the town just visible in the valley below. The road hairpinned back and forth up the side of the mountain, however, and just as I was contemplating taking a straight route across a rocky bit of land that dropped down to the stretch of road below, the devil rose up out of the darkness, and ran me over.</p><p>12 July 1703</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure you do not wish to spend the night, Gn\u00e4diger Herr?\u201d</p><p>The woman\u2019s voice was as smooth as the pearly white skin that he had moments ago been caressing with his mouth and tongue. Nikola gave the invitation serious consideration for a few seconds, aware that this particular pigeon could be his with just a nod of his head, but despite the rather insistent urges of his body, he declined.</p><p>\u201cAnother time, my sweet.\u201d He dropped a few coins onto the table next to where the innkeeper\u2019s wife sat in boneless grace, and he worried for a little moment that he had taken too much of her blood. But one look at the sultry eyes with their obvious invitation reassured him that the woman was under the influence of the peculiar form of bloodlust common to his donors, rather than the loss of blood itself.</p> <p>With a little bow, he strolled out of the inn, giving his waiting coachman orders to return home. His daughter would be home awaiting him, no doubt, and as his journey from Heidelberg had been delayed by bad weather, she would be worrying. Imogen was a worrier, he mused as the carriage lurched forward in the cooling night air. She got that from her mother.</p><p>Pain spiked through him at the memory of Margaret, pain and guilt that he hadn\u2019t loved her as she had deserved, and certainly not to the depth with which she had worshipped him. And that irritated him, for Margaret had been a gentle, loving woman who had spent the last twenty-three years of her life attending to his every need.</p><p>\u201cWomen,\u201d he muttered to himself, staring blindly out into the night as the carriage left the town and began the long, winding climb to Andras Castle. \u201cThey insist on being loving and kind and caring, and why do they do that? To make a man feel guilty, that\u2019s why. And then they lure innocent men who are busy with important scientific research into impregnating them, and then said busy men end up caring about said spawn. And these ladies smell good, too. Deliberately. The wenches.\u201d</p><p>Nikola nursed his sense of injustice as long as he could\u2014about ten minutes\u2014but even he knew it was a foolish attempt to avoid the truth: He had honored Margaret as best he could, but it wasn\u2019t what she was due. And now she had been dead seven years, and their youngest child, his son, his Benedikt, was off to university in Heidelberg. Margaret would be pleased by that. She had been the daughter of a cobbler, and had never imagined herself catching the local baron\u2019s eye, let alone being his wife and bearing him children.</p><p>\u201cAnd the truth is that I would never have married her except for the curse.\u201d Saying the words aloud seemed to make the guilt ease a little, as if acknowledging it took away some of its power. \u201cI could not love her, but I gave her my name, position, and wealth.\u201d</p><p>But not your heart, a tiny little voice pointed out. You gave her everything but your heart.</p><p>\u201cI did the best I could,\u201d he argued with the voice, shifting uncomfortably. Why the hell did he always end up having these arguments with himself? Did other people do such? Or was it something particular to his nature? He made a mental note to ask Imogen if she regularly held mental debates with herself, or if it was something that came with the curse. \u201cI gave her all I had.\u201d</p><p>That lie stung him even as the words passed his lips, and he slumped back against the cushioned seat, wondering why his conscience had chosen this moment to flagellate him. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if I can change anything. It\u2019s not as if I could go back in time and\u2014\u201d</p><p>A flash of white caught his peripheral vision just a scant second before the carriage rocked, and the coachman shouted angrily.</p><p>\u201cWhat the devil is going on?\u201d Nikola was out of the carriage when it lurched to a stop, his gaze, always good at night, immediately catching sight of a body lying to the side of the road.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis a woman, Master Nicky. She was suddenly right out in front of me, and ran right into Heinrich.\u201d</p><p>Old Ted, the coachman, slid down out of his seat with an audible grunt of pain, hobbling over to where Nikola crouched over the body of the woman. \u201cBe she dead, do ye think?\u201d</p><p>Nikola placed a hand on her neck. Her pulse was a bit fast, but present. \u201cNo. Just stunned. Let\u2019s roll her over to see if she\u2019s injured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the lantern,\u201d Ted said, limping heavily to the carriage to lift off a hook one of the lamps that illuminated the road before them. The light bobbed and jerked as he returned, but Nikola didn\u2019t need its yellow glow to see that there were no signs of blood or obvious injury on the woman who had run so heedlessly into his horse. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just like women,\u201d he said with a glower at the form lying before him. \u201cAlways doing things like running headlong into a man\u2019s carriage without the least thought of the damage they could do to a valuable horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, that they are,\u201d Old Ted agreed, spitting to the side as he considered the body of the woman. \u201cLooks like a proper hoor, she does, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoor?\u201d Nikola was momentarily distracted from the fresh injustice that had been brought into his life by this heedless woman. He cast his mind around his knowledge of the English language, which was excellent given that he had spent several years of his youth in England. It was in that country that he had first encountered Ted.</p> <p>\u201cAye, Master Nicky, a hoor. Doxy. Woman who ain\u2019t no better than she should be.\u201d</p><p>Nikola looked over the woman with a critical eye. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t appear to be a prostitute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s runnin\u2019 around in naught but her underbits. That\u2019s the sign of a right hoor, that is. No proper woman\u2019d be scamperin\u2019 down the road in her chemise, now, would she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn excellent point, and one I can\u2019t dispute. She is no doubt a whore, and best left to her own.\u201d</p><p>Carefully, he gathered her up in his arms and stood, surprised to find that not only did the woman feel exceptionally good pressed against him, but she smelled wonderful, as well. He closed his eyes for a moment, breathing deeply to capture the scent. It danced elusively on the edge of his awareness, something that was vaguely floral, but not at all like the scents used by the women with whom he\u2019d been familiar. It was earthy, and yet delicate, intriguing and mysterious.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t like mystery,\u201d he told the unconscious female.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, ye don\u2019t. And don\u2019t ye be having nothin\u2019 to do with the hoor, now, Master Nick. I\u2019ll just move her to the side of the road and we\u2019ll be on our way home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s certainly what she deserves, scaring poor Heinrich like that.\u201d Nikola wondered who the woman was, and what she was doing running down the road clad in a flimsy garment.</p><p>The bay, one of the two horses harnessed to the carriage, tossed his head up and down, and whinnied his agreement, pawing the ground to add a further comment on the travesty that had been done to him. His nearly hairless stump of a tail twitched in aggravation. Lucy, the one-eared mare next to him, leaned over and tried to bite him. Heinrich bared his teeth in return.</p><p>\u201cMadame. I would have your name so that I might know who to send the bill to should Heinrich prove to be injured.\u201d Nikola gave the limp body in his arms a little shake to wake her up, but she simply lolled there, warm and soft and smelling of things that made him feel too warm for his wool coat, not to mention the fact that his breeches had suddenly grown two sizes too small. His gaze traced down the soft swell of her bare arms up to lightly freckled rounded shoulders, and even more rounded breasts that were just barely visible at the square neckline of her chemise. He wondered what it would feel like to touch her arms, to sweep his hands along the delicate lines of her shoulders and neck, to dip his head down into the valley between her breasts and taste\u2014</p><p>\u201cJust you leave her on the grass.\u201d Ted\u2019s voice interrupted his thoughts. Nikola tore his gaze from the woman to see his coachman hobble over to the edge of the road, gesturing at a spot suitable for the removal of whores from the road. \u201cHer people will find her sooner or later.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI certainly have no need for a stray woman, let alone one of such dubious background,\u201d Nikola agreed, and strode over to the carriage, gently placing her on the seat. He pulled down a small footstool and placed it next to the coachman\u2019s box. \u201cLet us go home quickly, Ted, before Heinrich is forced to suffer any more indignities.\u201d</p><p>Ted sighed as he limped over to the carriage, but said nothing when Nikola held out an arm, instead grasping the carriage rail with one hand while stepping up onto the footstool, then more or less pulling himself into the coachman\u2019s seat.</p><p>Nikola tucked the footstool away again, and swung himself lightly into the carriage. As he closed the door, he heard a muttered, \u201cSo it\u2019s going to be like that, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do without the jaded comments. I\u2019m quite likely to find myself no longer in need of your services should they continue,\u201d Nikola called loudly, tucking the carriage blanket around the still-unconscious woman.</p><p>\u201cAnd just what will the young lady say about you bringin\u2019 home a hoor? That\u2019s what I\u2019d like to know,\u201d Ted yelled back, clucking to the horses to get them started.</p><p>Nikola was careful to brace the woman as the carriage lurched forward again, finally leaning back against the cushions when he was sure she would not roll off the seat. \u201cI am master in my own house, and none would dare gainsay me. Imogen does what I tell her.\u201d</p><p>He could have sworn that a disbelieving snort was the answer to that statement, but it could well have been Heinrich, so he let it pass without comment. Instead, he spent the rest of the ride home alternately fighting the need to slide down the blanket so he could stroke that luminous, soft skin, and worrying about just how he was going to explain the strange woman to his daughter.</p><p>\u201cPapa!\u201d</p> <p>Imogen was at the entrance to the large dwelling he called home when the carriage finally rolled to a stop outside the massive oak double doors. It might be a run-down, ramshackle sort of castle, but it was still his, and he loved every crumbling stone, every rotted board, every grimy window of it. Wrapped in a large woolen shawl, Imogen stood alongside a small group of servants, several of whom held torches. The smile on his daughter\u2019s face warmed something cold and tight inside him. His little Imogen, now a woman grown, but still his, and in the very likeness of her mother with soft blue eyes, and golden hair so bright it all but glowed.</p><p>Odd how he used to think that blondes were the epitome of beauty in a woman. He realized with a start that now he had a preference for brunettes, ones with freckled skin that seemed to beckon to him.</p><p>\u201cI was worried that you had an accident,\u201d Imogen said, coming forward when the footman opened the carriage door with powdery flourish. \u201cI thought you would be home three days ago.\u201d</p><p>Nikola held out his arms for her, suffering her to hug him, giving her a squeeze and kiss on the forehead in return. Like her mother, Imogen was an emotional sort of woman, not at all the clearheaded, logical beings that he and Benedikt were. Odd how families worked that way. \u201cI was delayed by the rains. You look peaked. Are you unwell? Have you been eating enough? Frau Leiven! Why is my daughter as pale as the moon?\u201d</p><p>Imogen laughed as he bellowed at the short woman who was as round as she was tall, her spherical self topped with a huge mound of fat sausage curls. The woman toddled forward, her hands twisting around themselves. She made a bobbing gesture that passed for a curtsy. \u201cThe Fr\u00e4ulein is very well, Baron, very well indeed. I have seen to it that she has eaten plentiful meals, and she has slept without interruption, and has indeed been most studious during your absence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is as pale as a ghost!\u201d he said sternly, waving a hand toward Imogen, now giggling in a most inane fashion. \u201cI did not employ you to ignore my daughter when I am away from home, madame. If you wish to keep your position, you will see to it that my orders are carried out to the fullest extent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would not...you could not be so cruel as to cast me from your very fireside?\u201d Frau Leiven clutched at her throat, her eyes huge with horror. \u201cPlease, my lord, I am but a poor widow with no family who will take me in!\u201d</p><p>Imogen rolled her eyes and put an arm around the rotund woman. \u201cPapa, you\u2019re scaring poor Anna. Pay him no heed, my dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall perish in the cold!\u201d the woman wailed.</p><p>Nikola sighed to himself.</p><p>\u201cI am too old to start again with a young child! Oh, please, please, Fr\u00e4ulein Imogen, do not let your father do this terrible thing and cast me out to the wolves!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not going to do anything of the sort, Anna. He doesn\u2019t mean a word of it. You know as well as I do that Papa is never so happy as when he is stomping around pretending he\u2019s a tyrant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am a tyrant, woman, and I will thank you to remember that,\u201d Nikola growled, setting the footstool in place before turning back to the carriage interior. \u201cBe so good as to have a fire lit in the Chinese room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Imogen asked, releasing her former governess, and now companion, to peer over Nikola\u2019s shoulder. \u201cAre we having a guest? Papa! Who is that woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSainted Mary,\u201d the round little Anna gasped, crossing herself as Nikola turned with the unknown woman of obviously ill repute in his arms. \u201cShe\u2019s dead! And that is exactly what will happen to me should the baron order me from your side, my dearest Fr\u00e4ulein Imogen!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is not dead,\u201d Nikola corrected. \u201cShe merely knocked herself insensible by running into Heinrich on the road below. Imogen, see to the room. You, Robbie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut who is she, Papa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRobEHR, monseigneur,\u201d the slim young footman said in a heavy French accent. He wore a powdered pale salmon wig, white satin breeches that Nikola felt were entirely too tight for viewing by innocent damsels like Imogen, and a navy blue jacket, part of the livery of his former employer. Copious rings bearing large jewels of dubious authenticity glittered on his fingers, while in one hand he held a lacy handkerchief that waggled when he spoke, leaving faint clouds of powder that drifted gently to the ground with each gesture. \u201cMy name, she is Robert, not the so mundane Robbie of the English.\u201d</p><p>Imogen tugged at Nikola\u2019s arm. \u201cIs she a friend of yours? How did she run into Heinrich? Have you known her long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father, he was named Robert, as well,\u201d Robert said with a haughty sniff and a curl of his lip as he eyed the unconscious woman. \u201cIt is a family name, monseigneur. A French family name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall die, die, I tell you, if you make me leave Andras Castle! It will be nothing short of murder!\u201d Frau Leiven danced around him, her hands clutched together. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if your name is Louis XIV, remove my trunk and things to my bedchamber. Imogen, cease fussing this instant and do as I ordered. Frau Leiven, if you continue to drivel in that annoying fashion, I really will cast you from the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAaargh!\u201d The governess clutched her sausage rolls and wailed. Imogen fluttered around her, offering reassurances that no harm would befall her.</p><p>Nikola hoisted the unknown woman higher up on his chest, annoyed that no one did as he commanded. He was lord and master of his home, by the saints, as he had long been telling his servants and children. The fact that they all disregarded that point was more than any sane man could bear. Not that his actions the last half hour had been particularly fraught with sanity, he thought as he looked down at the warm body that pressed so solidly against him. Men of intellect did not, as a rule, bring home stray women who insisted on flinging themselves on horses.</p> <p>Then again, perhaps they did, and he just hadn\u2019t been in such a situation before. He was in the middle of wondering whom of his acquaintance he could consult upon the matter when it struck him that he was once again arguing with himself.</p><p>\u201cImogen!\u201d he said loudly as he strode up the stairs and into the great hall.</p><p>\u201cYes, Papa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you debate various subjects with yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDebate?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, debate. Argue. Discuss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith...myself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, with yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mean actually speak out loud?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes. Sometimes it\u2019s just an argument carried on in your head.\u201d</p><p>Imogen appeared at his side as he headed for the staircase in the center of the hall, her brows pulled together in puzzlement. \u201cNo, Papa, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh.\u201d Perhaps it was something that came down the male line of the family. Or it could be the curse after all. That would imply Benedikt was stricken with it, as well, then. \u201cI will write to Benedikt and ask him,\u201d he said, nodding his head as he mounted the stairs, all five members of his household on his heels.</p><p>\u201cGone barmy the master \u2019as,\u201d Young Ted the stableboy said in a voice filled with dark portent.</p><p>A smacking sound answered that statement, immediately followed by a howl of pain.</p><p>\u201cMind yer tongue, lad. Master Nick isn\u2019t barmy; he\u2019s just eccentric. All them lords are,\u201d Old Ted said, then turned back to the door, shoving his son in front of him. \u201cYe come help me get the harness off of Heinrich. Ye know how testy he gets when he\u2019s not groomed right away....\u201d</p><p>Their voices trailed off when Nikola marched up two flights of stairs and turned down the wing that housed the family rooms. He passed first the lord\u2019s bedchamber, then the one belonging to his late wife, pausing at the door just beyond it.</p><p>\u201cOpen it,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>A small figure with red hair straggling out of her mobcap dashed toward the door, only to be stopped and pushed to the side. \u201cI am the footman most extraordinaire. You are only the maidservant,\u201d Robert told the redheaded maid, scowling at her as he wiped off the hand he had used to stop her. \u201cIt is my duty to open doors. Begone you and your so bent arm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can open a door if I wish to,\u201d the maid named Elizabet answered, squaring her thin shoulders, one arm, smaller and more emaciated than the other, clutched just under her nearly nonexistent bosom. \u201cThe master said I can do anything anyone else can do. He said my arm is nothing to be ashamed of, and that in some foreign places I\u2019d be revered as a god because I\u2019m different.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re just a woman,\u201d Robert said with another of his superior sniffs. \u201cYou cannot be the god. Only a man like me can be a god.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what Master says. He says I could be a footman if I really wanted to be one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would not be a footman, then,\u201d Robert argued. \u201cYou would be a footwoman. And no one wishes to have a footwoman. It is not done. Let go of the doorknob!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not! Master says\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaster says that if you think it\u2019s easy hauling a deadweight upstairs and all around the house,\u201d Nikola interrupted loudly, \u201cyou\u2019re bloody wrong. I don\u2019t care which of you opens the damned door just so it\u2019s opened before my arms break off from the strain, leaving me with the need to learn how to feed myself with my feet. And given the fact that I have never been able to do so much as pick up a quill with my toes, learning to eat with them is not going to end well. Open. The. Door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPapa, I still want to know who this woman is\u2014\u201d</p><p>Luckily for Nikola\u2019s sanity Robert managed to wrest Elizabet\u2019s hand away from the door, and flung it open with a glower at the little maid, saying as he did so, \u201cThe monseigneur rescued me from the so lecherous Count d\u2019Orville when he attempted to do wicked things to me with parts of his person that I will not mention in front of Mademoiselle Imogen. Me, and not you. Therefore, it is I who will open his doors when he has upon his hands the dead women.\u201d</p><p>Nikola, for what seemed like the hundredth time, wondered why he put up with the odd group of servants that seemed always to find him. \u201cI could have normal servants, you know, ones who knew their places and acted accordingly. At one point in my life, I did have normal servants. I wonder what happened to them, and whether they\u2019d be willing to return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they would be so boring,\u201d Imogen said, following him into the room.</p><p>He laid the woman gently on the bed, staring down at her for a few moments. In the lamplight, she seemed to be sleeping, nothing more, and the logical jump in thoughts from a sleeping woman to a woman in his bed giving him more pleasure than he could humanly conceive had him aware that his breeches were growing tighter by the second.</p><p>His gaze played along the length of her, lingering on the highlights of her attractions\u2014small but perfectly shaped breasts, rounded hips, and supple-looking legs. Just the thought of those legs wrapped around his hips while he buried himself in her left him in a state that might have been best described as \u201cfull to bursting.\u201d</p><p>It was not a pleasant experience.</p><p>\u201cWake up,\u201d he told the woman, tired of her just lying there demanding that he ogle her. He hated being bossed around, and if this woman of ill repute thought she was going to twist him around her long, sensitive fingers\u2014fingers that he suddenly could imagine doing so many things to him\u2014she should start thinking again.</p><p>To his surprise, her eyelashes fluttered a few times, then squeezed tightly shut for the count of three before they parted to reveal eyes the color of the stormy North Sea.</p><p>\u201cHrn?\u201d she asked, her gaze on him, her expression filled with confusion. \u201cWhat...uh...who are you?\u201d</p><p>She spoke English with an accent that he couldn\u2019t place for a moment before realizing it was one that he had heard from a colonist. How on earth had a colonial prostitute traveled to Austria? And why would she go to all that trouble? Were there no customers in the colonies with whom she could ply her wares? He allowed his gaze to wander over her again. If he were at all the sort of man who had to resort to a courtesan, she would most definitely fit his needs.</p><p>\u201cHello? Eyes up here, buster.\u201d</p><p>Nikola straightened up when the woman snapped at him, giving him an annoyed look. No one had ever snapped at him before. He did not care for the experience, and said with frosty dignity, \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were staring at my boobs,\u201d the woman answered, a defiant tilt to her chin that seemed to warm him despite his irritation with all the untoward snapping. \u201cThat\u2019s seriously over the line, and even if I didn\u2019t just turn in my boss for sexual harassment, and thus have become very familiar with what does and does not constitute inappropriate ogling, then I still would have an issue with you eyeing me like I\u2019m a slab of meat and you\u2019re a hungry wolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSexual harassment?\u201d Was she mad as well as heedless? \u201cI am not a wolf. I am a Moravian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you are is a damned ogler.\u201d</p><p>Imogen and the others in the room gasped in surprise at her use of profanity.</p><p>He flared his nostrils at her in a manner that had, in the past, never failed to intimidate those who had the audacity to irritate him, although now that he thought about it, there weren\u2019t very many people who deliberately attempted to try his temper in the manner of this annoying, delectable woman. \u201cMadame\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIo.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her for a few seconds. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIo. My name is Io.\u201d She pronounced the name \u201ceye-oh,\u201d as if that were perfectly ordinary. Which was ridiculous, because no one he knew bore a name with only vowels. It had to be something indigenous to the colonies. \u201cIt\u2019s actually Iolanthe, but no one calls me that but my tax accountant. Who are you?\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath, determined to take charge of the situation. \u201cMy name is Nikola Czerny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicole? I thought that was a girl\u2019s name.\u201d</p><p>Imogen gasped again. Frau Leiven clutched her throat and staggered over to a chair. Robert studied himself in a mirror that hung on a wall, and adjusted his wig to a rakish angle.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Nikola, and it is not a female name,\u201d Nikola answered in an even tone, despite the sudden and almost overwhelming urge to throttle the woman. Or kiss her. He wouldn\u2019t mind doing both, to be honest. \u201cIt is my name, and I am a man. It is nothing uncommon, not like a name that contains nary a single consonant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name has consonants!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-O,\u201d he said with much portent.</p><p>\u201cWell, that part is just vowels.\u201d She looked grumpy now, as if she did not like having the flaws in her reasoning pointed out. \u201cBut there\u2019s more to my full name than that. Just don\u2019t call me Yolanda. I hate that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well, Iolanthe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit, I just said don\u2019t call me that!\u201d She sat up, frowning and rubbing her head.</p><p>\u201cNo, you said not to call you Yolanda. I called you Iolanthe, which is a name that has proper syllables and consonants.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She punched his arm. \u201cIt sounds the same!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not. The \u2018the\u2019 at the end sounds rather like a \u2018da\u2019 when pronounced in German, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for the love of the five and forty virgins, just give it up! Call me Io. Yes, just the vowels, I know, you don\u2019t need to point it out again. Nikola, you said?\u201d Her nose wrinkled slightly as she thought. \u201cOh, with a k in the middle, like Tesla? That\u2019s actually a pretty cool name.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said gravely, making her a little bow. \u201cWere my parents alive, I would pass along to them your appreciation of it. I do not know this Tesla, but I have not met all the people in the valley. Now, if you would be so good to tell me what you were doing running into Heinrich. Were you fleeing your proprietress? Or a customer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA what, now?\u201d Io winced as she continued to rub her forehead. \u201cMan, I have the headache to end all headaches. What happened? Do I know you? You sound Austrian\u2014are you one of Gretl\u2019s friends?\u201d</p><p>Nikola refused to notice what an endearing picture she made when she blinked up at him with those smoky, mysterious eyes.</p><p>He did not like mysterious people. They were often annoying. \u201cI was born in Moravia, not Austria, although I have lived here from the time I reached my majority. For whom do you work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one, not anymore.\u201d She swung her legs over the edge of the bed, gripping the blankets and wobbling just enough that Nikola put his hands on her shoulders to keep her from toppling over.</p> <p>The feel of that tanned, freckled silken skin under his fingers made his blood tingle with desire. He told both his blood and his desire to cease acting inappropriately. He had better things to do with his time than stand here and touch this woman, his fingertips positively burning with the need to stroke that flesh, to lick it, to bite and drink his fill in the warmth that he was suddenly certain only she could bring him.</p><p>What the deuce was he thinking? He did not want to lick or bite or drink from this prostitute. He did not want to lay her in his bed and sate himself on her over and over and over again. He did not want to watch her eyes go dark with passion, or to feel her body tighten around him....</p><p>\u201cHey, are you all right? You look funny, like you\u2019ve got a painful gas bubble or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHrn?\u201d With an effort, Nikola dragged his attention from the erotic mental images that gripped him, and blinked down at the woman. \u201cPainful gas bubble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother used to get them a lot. She said they were a real bitch when she was around others.\u201d</p><p>He was aware of more horrified gasping from the servants and his daughter, but the amusement in the woman\u2019s eyes seemed to hold him in thrall. Who was she? And, more important, why did she affect him so strongly?</p> <p>\u201cMind you, she also had a tipped uterus, but I really don\u2019t think that has anything to do with the matter.\u201d</p><p>Had she cast some spell over him?</p><p>\u201cAnd of course, that\u2019s not a situation that would affect you, either.\u201d</p><p>It had to be a spell. He\u2019d never before reacted in such a manner to a woman.</p><p>\u201cMy mom used to say that drinking water helped a lot. The painful gas bubbles, that is, not the thing with her uterus.\u201d</p><p>He would simply demand that she remove the spell. Once she knew that he was aware of her trickery, she would be ashamed and would take her desirable, tempting person away from him.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t talk much, do you?\u201d</p><p>And then life would return to normal, and he could continue to be a martyr to his servants. He nodded to himself. That was what he\u2019d do. He\u2019d demand she remove the spell.</p> <p>\u201cNikola?\u201d</p><p>Io was asking him something. He rummaged around in his memory to find whatever it was she\u2019d been babbling about. \u201cNo,\u201d he finally said. \u201cI am not afflicted by painful wind in bubble or any other form.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s always good to know,\u201d she said pleasantly, a little smile curling the edges of her mouth. \u201cSo, anyway, I got fired from my last job by a boss who was Mr. Grabby Hands. Thanks, you can let go of me, I\u2019m OK now. I was just a bit dizzy for a few seconds. Is Gretl here? I assume I had some sort of an accident, but I\u2019ll be damned if I remember just what happened to me.\u201d</p><p>He released his hold on her shoulders, stepping back a foot in order to better pin her with a look. \u201cI wish for you to remove the spell you have cast upon me,\u201d he told her with a firmness that he felt brooked no opposition.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to what?\u201d Her forehead scrunched up, her nose wrinkling in such an adorable manner, it almost brought him to his knees.</p><p>More gasps sounded around the edges of the room, but this time they were less shocked and more fearful.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a witch!\u201d he heard Frau Leiven cry. \u201cShe\u2019s cast a spell on the baron! Where\u2019s the witch finder? Someone get the witch finder!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh for the love of Mike,\u201d Io said, peering around him to where the servants stood against the wall. \u201cA witch? I\u2019m not even remotely Wiccan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike?\u201d Nikola pounced on the word. \u201cWho is this Mike? Is he your lover?\u201d A sudden surge of hatred for this lover made his heart pound. He hated Mike. He had no idea who the man was, but he hated him with every morsel of his being. He had to curl his fingers into fists in order to keep from grabbing her and demanding to know where this wastrel, this Mike, was located.</p><p>Io was back to looking at him, as she should be, but he could have sworn there was real confusion in her eyes as she answered. \u201cNo. My last boyfriend\u2019s name was Thomas, but he was a real dick, so I dumped him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDick?\u201d How many lovers did she have? There must be limits, even for prostitutes. If nothing else, time must be a factor. If she serviced customers on average ten hours a day, at one hour per customer, with four days off per month, then that would make a yearly maximum of... He did the calculations in his head, didn\u2019t like the answer, and decided his equation was faulty.</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry, it\u2019s slang for\u2014\u201d She waved a hand toward the front of his breeches. \u201cPenis.\u201d</p><p>Instantly, he was hard.</p><p>More gasping ensued from the woodwork. \u201cThe witch speaks words of the devil!\u201d Frau Leiven declared, her reedy voice ringing with righteousness. \u201cShe will bespell us all if she is not tortured to reveal the truth about her dark master, beheaded, and burned, her ashes scattered to the four quarters so she cannot resume life and bespell us all again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? All that just for saying \u2018penis\u2019?\u201d Io shook her head at the emotional woman. \u201cI\u2019d heard there were some uptight folks in this part of the world, but I thought it was all just a bunch of bullshi\u2014er\u2014hooey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will cease speaking of your many lovers in front of my daughter,\u201d he said sternly.</p><p>\u201cMany lovers? I\u2019ve had exactly three boyfriends\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is a gentle and unlearned maiden, and does not know the ways of men.\u201d</p><p>Behind Io, Imogen snorted, then instantly schooled her expression into one of innocence.</p><p>\u201cLook, I know you guys are more conservative here\u2014although really, beheading? Scattering ashes? And I\u2019m sorry about saying the D-word if you have a kid, but really, you\u2019re overreacting. And it was you who asked about my last boyfriend, not that I see mentioning him is going to corrupt your snow-white daughter, but still, you mentioned him first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPapa\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilence.\u201d He narrowed his gaze on Io, picturing her beheaded. The thought gave him no pleasure. Quite the contrary, such an idea greatly disturbed him. \u201cDo you deny that you have put a spell on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is with you people? Yes, I deny it!\u201d Io slapped her hands on her thighs, a thought that sent his brain on a little mental trip that ended up with him clearing his throat and hoping the witch prostitute would not look toward his groin. \u201cAnd you can just stop that right now, too,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cStop what?\u201d He wanted nothing more than to pounce on her, he really did, but he was never one to allow his sexual needs to drive his actions, and he\u2019d be damned if he started now.</p><p>He smiled at the irony at the fact that he was already damned. What could a little more damnation hurt?</p><p>\u201cThat.\u201d Io pointed at his crotch. \u201cYou\u2019re getting all bulgy, and I resent your penis\u2019s implication that I\u2019m doing something to arouse you. Unless you\u2019re some sort of weirdo who gets off by women saying the word \u2018penis,\u2019 which is frankly kinda sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaron, you must stop her from speaking! It is the devil\u2019s words that come out of her mouth!\u201d Frau Leiven hurried around the bed to stand behind it, clapping her hands over Imogen\u2019s ears. \u201cShe will bespell us all!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaron?\u201d Io stopped glaring at his admittedly bulgy breeches and glanced up at him. \u201cI thought you said your name was Nikola.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. I am also a baron. Frau Leiven, if you do not cease squawking, I will have you put out of the castle. Imogen, go to your room. This conversation is not suitable for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, a real baron? Not one of those mall kinds that you become when you buy a square foot of land\u2014Imogen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Papa\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave!\u201d he commanded, feeling that if there were fewer people in the room, he could get about to seducing the woman properly.</p><p>His mind did a double take. Chastising her, he corrected to himself, despite the nagging suspicion that the first would be infinitely more enjoyable.</p><p>Io got to her feet and turned around, gawking in surprise. \u201cImogen, it is you. Nice to see you again. What happened to me? I seem to be a bit wonky in the brain. I remember doing...something...but just can\u2019t pin down exactly what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know my daughter?\u201d he asked, frowning first at Imogen, then at Frau Leiven. \u201cYou allowed Imogen to consort with whores?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Papa\u2014\u201d Imogen started to say, but Io interrupted her.</p><p>\u201cWhore?\u201d she bellowed, then immediately slapped both hands to her head, weaving with pain. \u201cOh my god, someone get me some ibuprofen. I think my head is going to explode.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He helped her to sit back down on the bed, his body warring with his mind. \u201cI do not know who Ibuprofen is, but if he is another of your lovers, I will have to adjust my equation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat equation? No, wait, it doesn\u2019t matter. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re the king or emperor or whatever they have here in Austria now\u2014you do not get to call me rude names.\u201d Io stood up again, weaving only slightly before she squared her shoulders and shot him a look that should have enraged him, but simply went straight to his groin.</p><p>He really was getting a little tired of everything about her making his rod stiff with need and desire and wanting that all but left his tongue cleaving to the roof of his mouth.</p> <p>She must be the best prostitute in the world if she could do all that without so much as touching him.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind,\u201d she said, trying to brush past him, \u201cI\u2019m going home. Or rather, I\u2019m going to go to my cousin\u2019s home. You guys can just continue on with your oddball ways without me. Imogen...hell, I don\u2019t know what to say to you. I guess I\u2019ll just keep mum to Gretl about the fact that you evidently have some...did you say daughter? Imogen is your daughter?\u201d Io looked startled when she turned to face Imogen again. \u201cYou told me your dad was dead. Although your brother said he wasn\u2019t, but I kind of figured he was a little light in the noggin since he also said he was some sort of a vampire.\u201d</p><p>Everyone in the room froze, including Nikola. The odd side of his mind noticed that Io\u2019s declaration had, at least, had the benefit of killing his erection, but that wasn\u2019t really important.</p><p>\u201cWho are you, how did you meet my children, and how do you know about\u2014\u201d He stopped, unwilling to speak in front of the superstitious servants. He\u2019d carried his secret close to his breast, not even allowing his valet to know the truth about Benedikt and Imogen, or how the curse had come to be. Other than his children, only two others knew the truth. He eyed the woman again. Had one of his half brothers spoken to her about him?</p><p>It was all very much a puzzle, and along with mysterious women, he disliked puzzles intensely.</p> <p>July 12</p><p>If someone finds this journal someday and says to herself, \u201cHoly jumping cats, whoever wrote this seriously needed to have some penmanship lessons,\u201d please note that I\u2019m writing with a quill. A quill. One from a bird. Goose, I think, or something big like that. Regardless, it\u2019s really, really hard to write with a quill without leaving big ole blotches of ink everywhere, not to mention ripping up the paper, and just trying to get letters formed so they\u2019re actually readable.</p><p>Man, things have gotten so weird, I\u2019m actually ranting about a feather.</p><p>But I promised I was going to do this properly, and I am.</p><p>Right after I woke up in some strange dude\u2019s place (and when I say \u201cstrange dude,\u201d I don\u2019t just mean someone I didn\u2019t know\u2014Nikola was a very odd man, what with his demands that I tell him about my boyfriends, and then getting bent out of shape when I did so, and some strange equation that he kept yammering on about), I knew immediately something seriously wrong was going on.</p><p>For one, I couldn\u2019t remember a damned thing about how I had ended up in the room.</p> <p>For another, and I\u2019m totally at a loss how this could even be, I seemed to have woken up in some ultraconservative cult, kind of like Amish people who insisted on living just as if they were three hundred years in the past.</p><p>And lastly, the strange dude appeared to be under the impression that I was a hooker. Me! And Imogen was a part of it. \u201cLook,\u201d I said to Imogen\u2019s father, who more closely resembled an older brother than a father, but it was clear there was some sort of weird genetic thing going on with that family.</p><p>You could say that.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m not a ho.\u201d I stopped, frowning at the voice in my head. I\u2019ve never been one to talk to myself, and I didn\u2019t want to start. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not exactly sure what I\u2019m doing here, but I really do think it\u2019s time I go back to town. Does someone have a phone I could use? I seem to have lost mine.\u201d</p><p>Everyone, every single person from the effeminate guy in some sort of Georgian costume with a big pink wig to the mega-conservative short, round lady who kept calling for the others to do heinous things to me, stared just as if I\u2019d said something exceptional.</p><p>\u201cWhat, you guys don\u2019t have any technology here?\u201d I glanced around the room. There was a fire in a fireplace set in the wall opposite the bed, and lots and lots of candles all over the room. It was a bit of a fire hazard, to be honest, and I wondered what sort of sprinkler system they had in place just in case one of those candles tipped over. \u201cNone whatsoever? Even the Amish folks can have cell phones if they keep them in a special place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s speaking in tongues!\u201d the crazy round lady exclaimed, pointing at me with one hand while clutching the tall, willowy Imogen with the other. \u201cShe is the devil\u2019s plaything and must be destroyed!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am no one\u2019s plaything, and nice manners abroad or not, you\u2019re really starting to work my nerves, lady,\u201d I told her, giving her a gimlet eye. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t dream of telling you people how to run your cult or religion or whatever it is that you\u2019re doing here, but I am not a doormat, and I will not let you walk all over me. So you can do the rest of us a big ole fat favor and just get over yourself already.\u201d</p> <p>I might have yelled that last sentence at the crazy lady, but that\u2019s no excuse for the handsome Nikola to suddenly snap into action, clearing the room of everyone in a matter of seconds.</p><p>\u201cLeave us!\u201d he bellowed, waving one imperious hand.</p><p>To my surprise, everyone did as he ordered. Imogen slid me a long, long look as she left, as well. That surprised me a bit, but I realized I had no claim on her friendship with Gretl.</p><p>Still, it would have been nice of her to offer me the use of her cell phone.</p><p>\u201cNow you will explain to me what game you are playing,\u201d Nikola demanded.</p><p>It was his eyes, I decided, that made a little shiver run down my back. He had the eyes of a white wolf: pale, icy blue, with a black ring around the outer edge of the iris. Set against that black hair, and a face that could have graced any fashion magazine, his eyes packed a wallop that I was steadfastly determined to resist.</p><p>I was not in the market for a man, even an older one who probably had worked out all his issues. Especially one who looked like Nikola did\u2014I knew from experience how men who felt they were god\u2019s gift to the world acted, and I wanted nothing to do with another one of that ilk.</p><p>\u201cI do not play games, not the sort you\u2019re referring to,\u201d I said with much dignity. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re busy with your party or cosplay or religious cult or whatever it is you folks are doing, so I\u2019ll just get out of your hair. I\u2019d prefer to call my cousin, but if you don\u2019t have a phone, then I guess I\u2019ll just have to walk to the nearest one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho told you I was a Dark One?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one told me...wait, you mean Dark One like vampire?\u201d I gawked at him for a minute. Had I gone completely insane? \u201cYou think you\u2019re a vampire, too? Like Benedikt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will tell me what you know of my son!\u201d he said as he stalked slowly toward me. \u201cYou will tell me how you have learned about the curse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will?\u201d He really was a handsome devil, once he stood where the candlelight could play all over his face. He was dressed in a costume, as well\u2014costume! He was wearing a costume! I slumped in relief on the bed, my anxiety level dropping when I realized that everyone must be attending a costume party. That or they were part of a local theater troupe. \u201cWhat curse would that be?\u201d</p><p>The one that has made my life a living hell.</p><p>I sat up straight at the voice in my head. Since when did my brain play tricks like that on me? I must have hit my head harder than I thought. Great, now I\u2019d have to go see a doctor to find out why voices were suddenly talking in my brain.</p><p>\u201cDo not play coy with me, madame. I neither desire nor seek such an attitude. Was it Rolf? Arnulf? Did they tell you what happened to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know an Arnold or a Ralph, so the answer to that is a rock-solid no.\u201d I eyed him as he moved toward me, all sorts of warning bells going off in my head, and not just because the man moved like a panther about to pounce on some unwary prey.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t a whole lot taller than me, but he was broad across the chest and shoulders; that much I could see even through the fancy outfit he wore. His hair was black, curly, and worn longish in the back, not\u2014thank god\u2014in a mullet, but still long enough that it was caught up in a little ponytail. He had an interesting face with a long, straight nose, a chin that made me a bit weak in the knees, and those eyes...oh, those eyes. He certainly didn\u2019t look like a man in his sixties, which he must be if Imogen was in her forties. I shook my head at my confused thoughts. There was just something different about Nikola that went beyond the obvious sex appeal.</p><p>Warmth flooded me at that acknowledgment, a sexual sort of warmth, one that startled me with its intensity. \u201cOh, lovely, I probably have some sort of serious brain injury as a result of...of...\u201d I screwed up my eyes and tried to force myself to remember what I had been doing before I woke up here.</p><p>\u201cYou did not hit Heinrich hard enough to injure your brain,\u201d Nikola said, his voice, a lovely rich baritone, doing something wonderful to my insides. \u201cYou will look at me when I am speaking to you!\u201d</p><p>Nothing breaks the spell of a yummy male voice like an obnoxious demand. I popped open one eye to glare at him. \u201cOK, one, you are so not the boss of me, and two, I do not respond well to orders. If you had asked politely, I would have told you that I\u2019ve closed my eyes so that I can try to remember what happened to me before I woke up here.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eye again, and concentrated.</p><p>\u201cI can tell you what you did to end up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I opened my eyes once more. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ran into Heinrich.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I frowned, not recognizing the name. Was it one of Gretl\u2019s friends? \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve met a Heinrich.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were running down the road in your underthings, and you ran directly into Heinrich, knocking yourself senseless.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at myself, shocked at the idea of running anywhere in my undies. \u201cI was running around in my underwear? What the hell was I doing that for? Who\u2019s Heinrich? And who dressed me again?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I have no idea, one of my carriage horses, and we did not find your gown, let alone put it on you. Now, you will cease\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute, I think we\u2019re talking at cross-purposes,\u201d I interrupted, holding up a hand to stop him.</p><p>He looked thoroughly outraged that I\u2019d do such a thing. \u201cYou will not interrupt me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just did, didn\u2019t I? Thus, I will. Er...did. And someone must have put my dress back on, assuming that I was, in fact, running around in my undies, because I\u2019m wearing it now. My dress, that is.\u201d I waved toward my torso. \u201cThis is really a bizarre conversation, you know that? Like, on the level of reality TV sort of bizarre.\u201d</p><p>He glanced down at my dress, his eyes lingering on my breasts in a way that had me tightening my fingers into fists. \u201cThat is your gown?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, and I\u2019ve asked you once to stop staring at my boobs. Keep it up and I\u2019ll make you one very sorry little cowpoke.\u201d</p><p>His gaze shifted up to mine, genuine confusion visible in his pale eyes. \u201cYou speak words that I do not know, and yet my grasp of English is excellent. What is a cowpoke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s someone who\u2019s going to be sorry if he doesn\u2019t stop staring at my breasts.\u201d</p><p>His gaze flickered straight back to my boobs. \u201cWhy? You present them for male appreciation, do you not?\u201d</p><p>I looked down, found the first button on my sundress had slipped open, and hastily rebuttoned it. \u201cNo, I wore this dress because it was hot and I wanted to stay cool while I... I...\u201d I frowned again as I tried to concentrate. Vague images seemed to flicker just out of the range of my vision, dark, fleeting images. \u201cI can almost see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour breasts? You will if you undo those buttons again.\u201d His gaze was frankly appreciative, but I had learned my lesson. I crossed my arms over my boobs, giving him a quick glare.</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d I turned my attention inward again. \u201cIt\u2019s just...there. I can almost see it. I was doing something important, something...profound.\u201d</p><p>Trees flashed passed my unseeing eyes, trees that were first richly green, then inky black in the night, the tips of their pine needles kissed by sunlight and moonlight alike. And something else hovered just beyond my awareness, something big, something important that I could almost reach out and touch....</p><p>\u201cThe swirly thing!\u201d I exclaimed, seeing it again when it came into mental focus, the blue-white light twisting and turning back upon itself in that strange fashion. \u201cI was taking pictures of it, and of the creepy forest, and I put my hand through the swirly thing....\u201d</p><p>I remembered again the feeling of static in the air when I leaned forward into the twisting light. I swayed, suddenly as light-headed as when I had fallen through the strange smoky object, but this time when I pitched forward, I fell right onto a warm, hard, very solid shape.</p><p>One who smelled faintly of lemon, leather, and something slightly earthy that had me turning my head into his neck in an attempt to capture more of it. A sudden urge flared to life in me, one that swept through my blood, making it impossible to resist. Before I could even weigh the consequences of my action, I opened my mouth and gently bit the tendon in Nikola\u2019s neck.</p><p>It was as if I\u2019d lit a match to a bonfire. He froze for a moment, and I knew I\u2019d shocked him, knew I was guilty of a far greater form of harassment than merely ogling my breasts, but before I could do so much as to pull away from him, I was on my back on the bed, Nikola covering my front, his eyes darkening even as I stared in complete astonishment. He didn\u2019t say anything, just dipped his head down until his lips burned a brand on my neck.</p><p>I was so shocked by what I\u2019d done, I didn\u2019t think to push him off me so I could apologize. On the contrary, I slid my hands up his arms, my legs moving restlessly as his weight made me sink into the soft mattress of the bed. All sorts of wickedly naughty erotic images danced in my head as his teeth scraped on my neck. I knew he was going to give me a love bite in return, knew I should stop it by apologizing for biting him, knew I should get far, far away from him, but apparently my brain had ceased to function, because the second his teeth bit my flesh, I arched back against him, writhing in ecstasy.</p><p>\u201cOh my god, do you know how to do this,\u201d I moaned, clutching his hair and squirming at the sensation of his mouth on my neck. My entire body seemed to be made of fire. \u201cBut really, I suppose...oh, lord, yes... I suppose we should stop because this really is way over the line, not that I\u2019m blameless since I bit you first, and dear god, you\u2019re not going to stop, are you?\u201d</p> <p>He pulled back from me, his eyes now a pure sapphire blue, his lips suddenly holding an unholy fascination for me. They were red, as if he\u2019d been kissing me, all gently curved lines, and so enticing I almost pulled him back down onto me.</p><p>A morsel of common sense remained to me, however, and I\u2019m proud to say that even in the full onset of a massive lust, I managed to keep from kissing the breath out of him.</p><p>\u201cI must stop, or you would die,\u201d he said in answer to my question, giving me an odd look before sliding off me.</p><p>For a few seconds I lay in a boneless, quivering mass of want and need and too many other emotions to untangle. \u201cWell, that was probably the best hickey I\u2019ve ever had, but I don\u2019t think it would have killed me.\u201d</p><p>He frowned as I sat up, rebuttoning the top button of my dress, which had popped open yet again. \u201cI do not know this word \u2018hickey,\u2019 either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means a love bite. Kind of a passionate one. Look, I\u2019m sorry I bit you. I don\u2019t know what possessed me. I\u2019m not at all a bitey sort of woman, and especially not with strangers. I\u2019m mortified that I was just yelling at you about ogling me and then I went and bit you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI enjoyed it. No one has ever bitten me before, not even my wife. She was always afraid to. She was afraid she would become like me.\u201d</p><p>A blush unlike any other washed up from my chest, burning my face with shame. \u201cI am so sorry. I didn\u2019t know you were married. There\u2019s no excuse for my behavior\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am widowed. My wife died several years ago.\u201d He eyed me as I put my hands on my blazing cheeks. \u201cIf you are not a whore, as you claim you are not, then who are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just me,\u201d I said with a little frustrated gesture. \u201cI\u2019m a former secretary. I like photography and traveling, although I haven\u2019t done much of either. I\u2019m spending the summer in St. Andras with my cousin Gretl. And I don\u2019t normally bite men, especially strange men, and really especially not men who are as handsome as you are. So no, I\u2019m not a whore, although I admit that after what I did to you, you\u2019d be justified in questioning that statement.\u201d I couldn\u2019t stop reliving the feel of his mouth on my neck. It was the most sensual thing I\u2019d ever felt.</p><p>It will only get better.</p><p>I froze, a dull feeling of worry filling my gut. What had I done to myself that I was hearing voices?</p><p>\u201cI told you that I enjoyed it. You will cease blushing over it. Who were you running from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one. At least, I don\u2019t think I was.\u201d I stopped worrying about having to go to the hospital for CAT scans and the like, and tried to remember what happened after I had fallen near the twisty light.</p><p>\u201cNot near it...through it,\u201d I said aloud, my eyes widening as the memory came flooding back to me of the daytime that had turned to night, of a dirt road where a paved one should have been, and of a carriage and horses looming up out of the night as I raced toward the town and safety.</p><p>A horrible, horrible idea started to dawn in the dim recesses of my brain, something so fantastic that I didn\u2019t even want to consider it.</p><p>\u201cThrough what?\u201d Nikola held out a hand for me, and without thinking, I took it, allowing him to pull me to my feet. I stared at him, my brain seizing up and refusing to process the idea.</p><p>\u201cIt was... I don\u2019t know what it was. A big swirly thing in the middle of the woods. Made up of light. I know this is going to sound really odd, but what\u2019s today\u2019s date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWoods? What wooded area? Near here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where here is, so I couldn\u2019t say. It\u2019s the place that all the people in St. Andras say is haunted. It\u2019s like halfway up the hill to the ruined castle. You didn\u2019t answer me about the date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndras Castle is not a ruin,\u201d he said, his fingers still holding mine. \u201cThe east wing needs some repairs, but I will attend to them now that I have returned from settling my son at university in Heidelberg.\u201d</p><p>The horrible idea my brain refused to cope with grew even stronger. \u201cWhat\u2019s the date?\u201d I asked again, holding my breath against the answer.</p><p>He frowned. \u201cToday? It is the twelfth of July.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the year?\u201d</p><p>His beautiful eyes, now back to pale, glacier blue, narrowed on me. \u201cYou do not know what year it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I did, but I have a magnificently horrible feeling I\u2019m going to be wrong. What year is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is 1703.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes for a second, my stomach lurching when the room spun. Nikola\u2019s fingers tightened, pulling me toward him.</p><p>\u201cAre you swooning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, just...oh, boy. You\u2019re kidding, aren\u2019t you? You\u2019re playacting that it\u2019s 1703? Or...or you\u2019re with some reenactment group or living-history place, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not jesting, no,\u201d he said, still frowning, and I could feel the truth of what he said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo. This is just...no. Impossible,\u201d I said softly, slumping against him when my brain fought to find sanity in this madness. \u201cHouston, we have a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNikola, not Houston. As for the problem you pose\u2014\u201d He eyed me again. \u201cI foresee much inconvenience in my future until you leave, not the least of which is the fact that despite just feeding from you, I wish to do so again. I will not be dictated to in this fashion, do you understand? I am not at all pliant, nor will I allow you to twine me about your fingers! I will feed when I wish to feed, and nothing you can do will change that!\u201d</p><p>I straightened up and stared at him, a beautiful, angry man, and wondered what the hell I\u2019d gotten myself into now. Whatever it was, he\u2019d have an aneurysm if he didn\u2019t calm down, and although his lack of anger management skills wasn\u2019t my problem, I kind of liked him. I felt some sort of a need to help him, although heaven knew why when he was being as unhelpful as possible.</p><p>The temptation is too great. Distance is protection.</p> <p>\u201cOK, Mr. Brain, you can just stop doing that because I\u2019m not taking you to a hospital right this second,\u201d I said sternly to myself.</p><p>Nikola\u2019s left eyebrow rose.</p><p>\u201cSorry. I don\u2019t normally talk out loud to my brain, but it\u2019s been doing weird things the last few minutes. What were we talking about? Oh, yes, I\u2019m sorry if you think I\u2019m twisting you around my little finger. I promise I\u2019ll stop doing that, OK? I don\u2019t know about feeding you, though. I\u2019m not a very good cook, although I\u2019ve been told my chicken spaghetti is pretty good. Feel better? Excellent. I think I need to go into town, though, because otherwise, I really am going to worry that I\u2019ve gone insane, what with you telling me it\u2019s 1703, and my brain thinking that maybe it could be if that swirly thing was some sort of Doctor Who TARDIS thingie, and if it is, I can tell you that this isn\u2019t going to end well.\u201d I smiled brightly at him and headed for the door.</p><p>He didn\u2019t stop me, as I half expected him to. Instead he just followed me as I opened the door and stepped out into a narrow hallway dimly lit by a stand of candles at the far end. \u201cYou guys really take your reenactment seriously, huh?\u201d I said as I strolled down the hall, determined to be as calm as I could. There would be all the time in the world to panic later if I found out I really had gone insane. \u201cI had a friend who used to be into the Civil War stuff, but she got tired of wearing the big hoop skirts. Said it was impossible to go to the bathroom without having to disrobe first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you not believe that I am speaking the truth?\u201d Nikola asked. \u201cI feel obligated to point out that if you were a man, I would challenge you for such an insult. But as you are a woman, and a strange one at that, I will merely make a mental note to punish you later for such insolence.\u201d</p> <p>To Nikola\u2019s (and my own) surprise, I laughed at such an outrageous statement. \u201cPunish me?\u201d I asked, smiling over my shoulder at him before descending the long, curving staircase to the floor below. \u201cLike what, a spanking? Or are you going to send me to my room for a time-out?\u201d</p><p>I could send you to my room. That would be far more interesting.</p><p>I paused, and blinked, my fingers tightening around the banister, a little spurt of fear making my stomach hurt. Why was my brain doing this to me? What the hell was wrong with me?</p><p>\u201cI am simply stating a fact. I am literally the lord and master here, madame, and as you have placed yourself in my protection\u2014\u201d</p><p>I continued down the stairs, distracted from my worries about my impending mental breakdown by Nikola\u2019s ridiculous attitude. \u201cI did nothing of the sort. I simply ran into some guy named Heinrich.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHorse. Heinrich is my horse, as I have stated already. Do not make me repeat myself.\u201d</p> <p>I paused again, watching with disbelief as he marched steadfastly down the stairs, stopping at the bottom to glance up at me. \u201cYou really are a piece of work, you know that? Even if this was 1703, and honestly, I\u2019m not so far gone into derangement that I\u2019m willing to believe that, but even if it was the truth, then still that attitude must have been pretty much unbearable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more so than your insistence that I\u2019m lying about the date,\u201d he said, making an irritated gesture toward me. \u201cAs for your other claims, they are just as ridiculous. I am not unbearable. I am generosity personified. I must be, or else I would be demanding recompense for the damage you\u2019ve done to Heinrich, not to mention the indisposition you\u2019ve put to my house by forcing me to give you shelter when you knocked yourself witless. A lesser man, an unbearable man, would have tossed you on the verge as Old Ted suggested. That you are here now, lambasting me with the vilest of slurs, is proof to the contrary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like how you talk,\u201d I said, slowly continuing down the stairs until I stood next to him. \u201cI don\u2019t quite understand why you have an English accent rather than an Austrian one, but I like it nonetheless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spent many years in England,\u201d he said, frowning. \u201cMy mother was English. My father is from Moravia. I mentioned that, too, although you apparently wish to ignore it. Why, I have no idea. I will consider it one of your many peccadilloes, and move past it to more important things, such as who told you about the curse, how you know my children, and just what you were doing out on the road where you might ambush my carriage.\u201d He squinted at me slightly. \u201cI begin to suspect you are misleading me with regards to your acquaintanceship with Rolf.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and walked past him, taking in the entryway hall. It, too, was lit by clumps of candles, and a fire crackling away in a huge fireplace across the room. I headed for the double doors that must surely lead outside. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever met a Ralph\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRolf\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHim, too. Let alone know one well enough to mislead you about him. I\u2019m going to town. How far is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlightly under four miles via the road. Less as the crow flies.\u201d</p> <p>I opened the nearest door, rubbing my arms and shivering a little when the night air swirled around me. Outside, the darkness was broken up here and there by a gentle glow from a handful of windows. Gravel crunched under my feet as I took a few steps away from the house before turning to look back at it.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a house. It was a castle. A big ole stone castle, right there in front of me. I tipped my head back as far as it would go, allowing my gaze to wander along crumbling bits of stonework, and the tall, pointy spire that rose closest to me. It was a castle with a tower. Of course it was. Where else would I be but a who-knew-how-many-hundreds-of-years-old castle.</p><p>\u201cThis looks like the painting of Andras Castle that Gretl has hanging on her dining room wall,\u201d I commented, still rubbing my arms.</p><p>Nikola tsked impatiently, pulling off his long-tailed coat jacket, and slung it around me. \u201cThat is because it is Andras Castle.\u201d</p><p>I gave him a long look.</p><p>He gave it right back to me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going into town,\u201d I said. \u201cWhich way is it?\u201d</p><p>He pointed over my shoulder. I turned and started walking, somewhat disappointed when he didn\u2019t join me.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need him,\u201d I told myself a minute later when it was clear he was just going to let me walk off wearing his fancy costume coat. I glanced back, but he stood at the doors, watching me. He didn\u2019t even wave good-bye, the rat. \u201cJust because he\u2019s the world\u2019s best hickey-giver doesn\u2019t mean you want anything more to do with him. Besides, he\u2019s bossy and arrogant and clearly thinks he\u2019s above the rules the rest of us have to follow, and if you haven\u2019t learned by now what trouble that sort of man can be, then you really are insane.\u201d</p><p>Lecturing myself didn\u2019t help much. Especially once I got beyond the boundaries of the landscaped lawns, somewhat seedy topiaries, and an avenue of arched, leafy trees. Three minutes after I had walked away from Nikola, I was beginning to regret my actions. The darkness seemed to close in around me, while the soft thud of my footsteps on the now-dirt road echoed the beat of my heart. Overhead, fleeting shapes of obsidian danced across the night sky, the moon too obscured for me to make out if they were night birds, or bats.</p><p>\u201cI really hope they\u2019re owls or something,\u201d I muttered to myself, rubbing my arms again, this time in reaction to the thought of creepy little bats flying around me. The darkness was beginning to get to me, making me twitchy at the slightest of sounds, and just the possibility that they were bats made me want to run straight back into Nikola\u2019s arms.</p><p>Castle! His castle, not his arms. What on earth was I thinking? \u201cAnd if wanting to throw myself into his arms isn\u2019t a sign I\u2019ve done myself some sort of head injury, I just don\u2019t know what\u2014argh!\u201d</p><p>A large shape loomed up out of nowhere, making me shriek and stumble backward into a small shrub.</p><p>\u201cI suppose I should be thankful that this time you sprang away from my horse rather than into him,\u201d a male voice said with calm indifference.</p><p>I pushed my way out of the shrub and glared up at Nikola where he sat mounted on a white horse.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell! You run me down and have the nerve to complain about the fact that I flung myself out of the way of that monster\u2019s pounding hooves?\u201d</p><p>He sighed and dismounted, leading the white horse toward me, and a second that I hadn\u2019t noticed until that moment. \u201cYou did so unnecessarily. Demeter hasn\u2019t trampled a lady underfoot in months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I asked when he held out his hand for me, and split my suspicious look between him and the horses.</p><p>\u201cYou wish to go to town. Old Ted has retired for the evening. Since it is not a pleasant walk, we will ride.\u201d</p><p>He took my hand and pulled me over to the second horse, a long-faced bay who snuffled me curiously when Nikola led me to his side. \u201cOh. Well, that was thoughtful of you. Hey, wait just a minute. You don\u2019t expect me to get up there, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be difficult to ride him any other way, although I admit that I would enjoy watching your attempt to do so. Are you afraid of horses?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot particularly.\u201d I eyed the animal. It didn\u2019t look overly pleased to see me. I seconded its sentiments. \u201cI just haven\u2019t done much riding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThor is Imogen\u2019s mount. He has very nice manners. Gather up your gown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d I stopped tentatively patting the neck of the horse in order to give it the (wholly false) impression that I was a competent horsewoman, and turned to ask Nikola what he meant, but before anything more could come out of my mouth, he grasped me by my waist and heaved me upward, plopping me down sideways on the saddle.</p> <p>That was when I realized there was something wrong with it. Or rather with me. \u201cThis is\u2014I\u2019ve never ridden in a sidesaddle. Am I supposed to sit sideways? It\u2019s kind of uncomfortable if I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t ridden at all?\u201d Incredulity fairly dripped off his words.</p><p>\u201cNo, and you can stop with the superior attitude. I\u2019m a San Francisco girl, born and raised. I haven\u2019t been on a horse since I went to fat girls\u2019 camp when I was eleven, and they had proper saddles. This one is seriously funky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHook your leg over the pommel,\u201d Nikola explained, gesturing toward a curved piece that poked up off the front of the saddle. \u201cYour other foot goes in the stirrup.\u201d</p><p>I leaned back a little and pulled my knee toward myself in preparation to doing as he said, but ended up just continuing on backward, promptly falling off the horse.</p> <p>\u201cOw,\u201d I muttered, spitting out a mouthful of dirt and glaring up at the horse\u2019s legs. \u201cYou did that on purpose, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you addressing Thor or me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth of you.\u201d I took the hand offered and allowed Nikola to assist me to my feet, brushing off the front of my sundress, and covertly trying to dig out dirt from where it had gotten into my bra. \u201cYou know, I think I\u2019ll walk to town. I\u2019m less likely to end up with a broken nose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so weak,\u201d he said, and hoisted me up onto the dratted horse again. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine how you never learned to ride properly, but now is not the time to give in to your fears. Hook your leg thusly.\u201d</p><p>It took a good five minutes of coaching, but at last I had my legs arranged to Nikola\u2019s satisfaction. I wobbled a bit precariously while he walked the horse in a circle and explained how to adjust my balance for the movement of the horse, but in the end, I decided to stick it out rather than walk the three miles into town.</p><p>Mostly because some unknown romantic part of me wanted a moonlit ride with a handsome man, even if there was the possibility that one of us had gone over the deep end.</p> <p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t so bad,\u201d I said a short while later, after having released the death grip I held on a clump of the horse\u2019s mane. \u201cI think I\u2019ve gotten the hang of this whole move-along-with-the-horse thing. Can we go faster? Without me falling off, that is? I could walk as fast as the horses, and I\u2019d really like to get to town to see if it\u2019s you or me who\u2019s deranged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you like,\u201d was all he said, and the next thing I knew, he clicked his tongue and the white monster he was riding took off like a rocket. One with four legs and a tail.</p><p>Here\u2019s the thing about horses\u2014evidently if they hang out together a lot, they buy into this whole \u201cbest friends forever\u201d thing, and when one of them suddenly bolts, the other feels obligated to join in the fun and frolics.</p><p>\u201cI believe the answer to your question is no,\u201d a voice said to me when I groaned and rolled over onto my back to stare up at the night sky.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Gingerly, I moved my arms and legs to make sure everything was in working order. It was, although parts of me were slightly bruised. I was also somewhat dazed from the unexpected impact with the ground. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asked if you could go faster without falling off. The answer to that is no, you cannot. Are you injured?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno.\u201d I groaned again, just because I felt like I was due a bit of pity. I looked at Nikola to see if he was likely to feel sympathetic toward me, but caught him ogling my legs, which were exposed up to midthigh since my dress had gotten twisted around. \u201cHey, what did I say about eyes up here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou objected to me enjoying your breasts. You said nothing about your legs.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt applies to everywhere.\u201d I sat up and pulled down the skirt of my dress, giving him a really quality glare that I suspected he couldn\u2019t see, even though he seemed to have no problem seeing my legs.</p><p>They would be a shame to miss.</p><p>\u201cWhoa!\u201d I scrambled to my feet before Nikola could even get out of my way. \u201cHelp me onto this horse. I have to get to town to get some serious medical attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are injured, then?\u201d Nikola asked, boosting me onto the horse.</p><p>\u201cNot in the way you mean, but I keep\u2014\u201d I bit off the words, not wanting to tell him that I had suffered some sort of weird brain thing when I blacked out earlier, and was now experiencing delusions of the highest caliber.</p><p>You seem anything but delusional to me.</p><p>\u201cOh, god,\u201d I sobbed, swinging my leg around the pommel, and using both hands to clutch the reins along with Thor\u2019s mane. \u201cWe have to get into town fast. Does this horse have a turbo mode, or third gear, or whatever you do to make them go really fast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Why are you shaking? If you tighten those reins any more, Thor will assume you wish for him to rear, and you\u2019ll end up on the ground again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going insane. I keep hearing voices in my head,\u201d I said without realizing it until the words left my lips. I loosened up my death grip on the reins to clap one hand over my mouth, my eyes on Nikola to see how he\u2019d react to my admission of insanity.</p><p>He simply raised one of his glossy black eyebrows. And for some reason, that seemed to make me feel much better.</p><p>It\u2019s true that is odd, but there could well be a reasonable explanation.</p><p>\u201cAck!\u201d I screeched. \u201cThere it goes again! Quick, I have to get to doctor before my brain erodes any further.\u201d</p><p>12 July 1703</p><p>Nikola wasn\u2019t sure what instinct warned him that the oddly named woman was close to losing control of her wits, but some innate sense given to men regarding women had come through when he needed it, and rather than point out to Io that her insistence that the nearest doctor could help her over her derangement was not at all reasonable (given that Herr Doktor Huebe had four-footed patients as well as those of merely two), he did as she demanded, and rode with her into town.</p><p>\u201cYou are not in the least bit good at riding, and in saying that, I use the broadest definition of the word \u2018good,\u2019\u201d he said conversationally some ten minutes later when he managed to catch her as she almost slid out of the saddle. He set her aright again, wincing in sympathy with Thor when she dropped the reins and clutched the horse\u2019s mane in a fierce grip. \u201cYou\u2019re not even tolerably mediocre.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s no thanks to this stupid saddle,\u201d she snapped back in a wholly undeserved manner. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be the most ridiculous, most sexist thing ever invented. I just bet that whatever man thought up this monstrosity of a saddle was bent on keeping women subservient and dependent on others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWomen are subservient and dependent on others,\u201d he pointed out, catching her again as she skewed around to glare at him. \u201cIt is the way of things, and if you cease flinging yourself about in the saddle, you might stay atop Thor rather than repeatedly sliding off him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, you may think you\u2019re all Mr. Seventeen Hundreds Nobility and whatnot, but until I find out that I\u2019ve really gone to la-la land, and not having a mental breakdown like I think I\u2019m having because of the voices in my head, I\u2019m not going to play your little game of how things used to be. So you can just stop trying to work my nerves, and tell me instead how to make this horse go faster. We\u2019ve been riding forever and I still don\u2019t even see the town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we went faster, you\u2019d fall off again,\u201d he pointed out, ignoring the gibberish part of her conversation despite finding it more than a little amusing.</p><p>He realized with a shock that he found her amusing, as well. How long had it been since he\u2019d been entertained merely by conversing with a woman?</p><p>Chauvinist pig.</p><p>He frowned, wondering where that thought had come from. He wasn\u2019t entirely sure where Chauvin was, or why their pigs would occur to him at that moment, but he assumed that something Io had said had triggered a long-lost memory.</p><p>\u201cOh, man, I\u2019m so going insane. Distract my wonky brain, Nikola!\u201d Io demanded.</p><p>He thought of pointing out that he was not accustomed to people making demands of him, let alone fulfilling them, but admitted that he did not find conversation with her tiresome, as he did so many other women.</p><p>Dawg!</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d she asked, impatience quite audible in the single word.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to distract me so I don\u2019t sit here and freak out any more about going insane while we slowly amble our way down the side of this mountain, like a couple of slugs out for a leisurely stroll. So get on with the distracting. What are you thinking about right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking about dogs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of a dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Absently, he reached out and grabbed her arm to keep her from slipping off the side of Thor.</p><p>The look on her face was priceless. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking about a dog, but you don\u2019t know which one? Maybe I\u2019m not the only one who should be seeing the doctor.\u201d</p><p>Nikola considered this. \u201cHe is certainly fairly conversant with their ailments.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him a couple of times. When she spoke, her voice was fairly strained. \u201cWho is fairly conversant with dogs\u2019 ailments?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he agreed, turning his mind to the issue of what he was going to do with her. Oh, it was true she hadn\u2019t begged him for help in escaping her local protector, whoever that should be\u2014and he wasn\u2019t entirely certain he didn\u2019t believe her claim that she wasn\u2019t a light-skirt, since she hadn\u2019t once made an attempt to touch him, not in a sexual way, at least. Well, there was that little bite she had given him, but surely that wasn\u2019t an overture. It hadn\u2019t felt like a blatant sexual hint, and it had been his experience that women of loose morals made bold with their hands, something Io had most definitely not done. No, she most likely was not a doxy, and that meant he couldn\u2019t just give her over to the local horse doctor and be on his way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For whatever the reason, he felt the need to protect her. He had a suspicion, however, that she wouldn\u2019t enjoy that sentiment.</p><p>Io took a deep breath. \u201cOK, we\u2019re going to do this again, because if nothing else, it\u2019s keeping me from worrying about the state of my brain. I said you\u2019re thinking about a dog, and you said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe I said that I was thinking about a dog, not you,\u201d he interrupted, considering the fracas that would follow if he should attempt to install her in his house. The temptation she posed him would surely disturb his peace of mind, if nothing else.</p> <p>The noise of more air being sucked in registered on his ears.</p><p>\u201cAnd you said that some dude would be familiar with dogs\u2019 illnesses, and I said who, and you said yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d Perhaps he could house her somewhere in town where she wouldn\u2019t distract him with that silken flesh, and those long legs, and the small, but pert, breasts that looked like they were made just for his hands. And mouth. And possibly other parts of him.</p><p>\u201cWho is the dude?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is, yes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo help me god,\u201d Io said, breathing heavily through her nose, \u201cif you say \u2018Who\u2019s on first?\u2019 I\u2019m going to deck you good and proper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst what?\u201d he asked, confused now.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know! Wait, he\u2019s on third base! Hahahahah!\u201d Io sounded the slightest bit hysterical.</p><p>He cast her a wary glance, wondering if she might not be as deranged as she kept claiming. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know Huebe, why are you convinced he\u2019s first at anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAaaargh!\u201d Io screamed, her arms flailing wildly, causing Thor to take exception to such behavior, and before he could say \u201chasenpfeffer,\u201d once again she was on the ground spitting out dirt and grass.</p><p>By the time he had dusted her off, and worked out that she was saying the English word \u201cwho\u201d instead of Huebe, he decided that she would be one mass of bruises if he allowed her to continue to ride on her own. Without further ado, he mounted Demeter, reached down with one hand, and told her to swing herself up in front of him.</p> <p>To his surprise (and no little pleasure) she did so without any objection, settling sideways across his thighs, one arm wrapped around his waist while the other clutched his jacket front.</p><p>\u201cAll right, but only because your horse doesn\u2019t like me at all,\u201d she said, her breath skittering across his cheek in a way that left his groin heavy and in bad need of a woman\u2019s attention. \u201cCan we shift into third now, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve shifted as much as I can,\u201d he replied, trying to squeeze a little extra room for her between his body and the pommel, which he knew had to be pressed uncomfortably against her thigh.</p><p>Her long, luscious thigh.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant. Can we go fast?\u201d</p><p>He tied the reins of Thor to his saddle, and pressed his heels to Demeter. She didn\u2019t care to have two people on her back, and did a little dance of annoyance that he quelled with a muttered imprecation about females.</p><p>\u201cWho, now?\u201d Io asked.</p><p>\u201cHuebe, not who.\u201d</p> <p>The look she gave him by rights should have dropped him dead on the spot, but of course, he couldn\u2019t die. Not anymore.</p><p>\u201cTake a look at my face. Do you see my expression? Does it scare you? It should, because this is the expression of a woman who\u2019s fallen off a horse too many times to put up with more shenanigans of the verbal variety. Got that? Good. What female, exactly, were you muttering those bad things about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDemeter. Although I was also close to speaking my thoughts about your thighs, but I felt that, given the present circumstances, you would not care to hear them.\u201d</p><p>She blinked again at him. \u201cHear my thighs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy thoughts. You can\u2019t hear thighs. Not unless they were wrapped around one\u2019s head rubbing against the ears.\u201d And just the thought of that was enough to almost bring him to his knees. Metaphorically speaking.</p><p>Io froze for a moment, her fingers tight on his jacket front. \u201cWhy, oh, why did I leave my pink penguin at home?\u201d</p><p>Nikola wasn\u2019t sure how to best answer that question, but being in a somewhat benevolent mood despite the insistent throb of his personal parts, he made an attempt at answering it. \u201cPerhaps penguins were not allowed on the ship that you sailed on to Europe. However, I will admit that I have never seen a pink penguin, and I take quite an interest in natural history. The only descriptions I\u2019ve read all state that they are in shades of white, black, and gray, some of which have slight touches of color around the head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not...er...it\u2019s not a real penguin.\u201d For some reason, Io seemed flustered by this turn in conversation. He was more than intrigued by that phenomenon. \u201cIt\u2019s my Tingleator. It\u2019s shaped like a penguin, you see.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, but not because they were approaching a shaded section of the road into the valley below. He had no difficulty seeing the road even in the darkest of nights. No, his was a frown of incomprehension, and that was something he disliked intensely. He hated feeling left out of knowledge. \u201cI am unfamiliar with a Tingleator. You will describe it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, that may have been too regional. It\u2019s my hoe, you know?\u201d</p><p>His frown deepened.</p><p>\u201cMy hoe for the ladygarden.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps she was mad. Her conversation certainly didn\u2019t make too much sense. \u201cYou wish to discuss gardening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that kind of garden. Oh, god, you\u2019re going to make me spell it out, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Her breath teased his cheek again as she sighed. \u201cBecause my life couldn\u2019t be any more embarrassing than sitting on some strange man\u2019s lap talking about vibrators.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWoman! You are doing this deliberately!\u201d Nikola had reached the end of his patience. He stopped the horse, shifting Io slightly so as to be able to reach into one of his coat pockets.</p><p>\u201cHuh? What have I done? Eek! Stop moving like that or I\u2019ll fall again, and I\u2019ve reached my limit of daily falls from a horse!\u201d She wrapped both arms around him, her eyes huge as he struggled to extract his hand from his pocket. \u201cOh my god you\u2019re going to shoot me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not, but I will admit that it is a tempting thought. Cease struggling or Demeter will object. If you release my arm, I can move it.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed on his. \u201cYou\u2019re just going to pull out a gun or Mace or something and get revenge on me because...because...well, hell, I don\u2019t know why you\u2019d want revenge on me. I\u2019m the one who\u2019s been dumped on the ground all night long.\u201d</p><p>By sheer dint of superb horsemanship, Nikola managed to keep control not only of his mount and the interested Thor, who kept bumping his back in hopes of treats, but the wildcat in his arms. \u201cI am simply tired of you flaunting your knowledge at me,\u201d he snapped, pulling his hand from his pocket. In it was a small memorandum journal.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m what? What knowledge?\u201d Io stopped struggling and watched with curiosity as he flipped open the journal, and wrote with a small pencil that had seen better days.</p><p>\u201cYour words. You are using them deliberately to show me that I am inferior to you, and that I will not have. Is \u2018ladygarden\u2019 one word or two? And this \u2018vibrator\u2019\u2014is it a proper noun?\u201d</p><p>She started to laugh, causing Demeter to lay back her ears in warning. Nikola, with one eye on his annoyed horse, tucked away his journal after making a few notes, and sent Demeter into a fast trot.</p><p>Io stopped laughing, eeped, and clung to him in a highly gratifying manner for a few minutes before evidently realizing he wasn\u2019t going to allow her to fall.</p><p>She loosened her hold on his arms and gave him a long look from those lovely eyes. \u201cYou seriously think I\u2019m using words you\u2019re not familiar with on purpose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have told you that I have an excellent grasp on the English language. I have not been to the colonies, but I understand that English is spoken there. You seem to have no difficulty in understanding my speech; therefore, you are deliberately attempting to confuse and belittle me linguistically.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can assure you, Nikola,\u201d she said with a telltale twitch of her lips, \u201cthat I am not trying to do either. I don\u2019t play the superior game with people, and even if I did, I certainly wouldn\u2019t with someone for whom English isn\u2019t a first language. I\u2019m horrible at languages, so honestly, I\u2019m impressed with anyone who can speak more than one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will accept your apology for making me feel inferior,\u201d he said magnanimously.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t apologize\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut only because you will now proceed to explain the phrases I do not understand. Let us commence with \u2018ladygarden.\u2019\u201d</p><p>She started laughing again, but after a few false starts, and quite a number of blushes, he was finally able to store the words \u2018ladygarden,\u2019 \u2018vibrator,\u2019 and \u2018love rocket\u2019 away in his mental dictionary.</p><p>\u201cDo women from the colonies use phalluses frequently?\u201d he was driven to ask as they neared the outskirts of town.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no longer a colony.... Oh, skip it. Yes, women in the U.S. use lots of vibrators. And...er...other things. Nonvibratory ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him again. He was beginning to find it a wholly endearing gesture. \u201cWhy do they use a vibrator?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, why? Are there not enough men in the colonies?\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath. He enjoyed the effect that action had on her chest, one breast of which was pressed against him. He began sorting through conversational gambits to pick out the ones that would continue to make her take deep breaths. \u201cSome women,\u201d she said with obvious emphasis, \u201cdon\u2019t need a man in their life. Some of us are quite happy as we are, and like to be in control of our sexual needs and gratification, rather than leaving it to a man who may or may not get his jollies in two minutes flat and leave us lying there unfulfilled and so frustrated we could scream.\u201d She took another deep breath, and his penis commended the action. \u201cNot that I\u2019m speaking from experience, you understand.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou are a virgin?\u201d He found that difficult to believe, not because he had first assumed she was a prostitute, but because she was so clearly meant for male delight, he didn\u2019t believe any man would be so foolish as to leave her alone.</p><p>She sat bolt upright in his lap, her eyes spitting annoyance. \u201cThat, sir, is none of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a virgin?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, of course not! I\u2019m in my thirties, for heaven\u2019s sake. What do you think I am, some sort of nun or something? Sheesh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Good. I dislike virgins. They tend to weep, and wring their hands, and recoil in horror from the sight of an erect penis, and nothing disturbs a man\u2019s peace of mind more than a weeping, hand-wringing virgin shrieking about his penis up and down the house.\u201d A thought occurred to him at that moment, an unpleasant thought. If she wasn\u2019t a virgin, then she must have been with a man. He gritted his teeth at the thought of some man, probably one of those rough, unkempt colonials, sating his manly lust upon her.</p><p>\u201cI think a wee chink in your research armor is showing, Nikola,\u201d she said softly, turning her back to him.</p><p>He wanted to demand she tell him the name of the lusty colonial who took pleasure in her tempting body. He also wanted to tell himself he didn\u2019t care one infinitesimally small jot about how many men had touched her body, but he knew that thought wouldn\u2019t even complete itself satisfactorily before it was dismissed as irrelevant and untrue.</p><p>\u201cIn the history books I\u2019ve read,\u201d she continued, just as if he weren\u2019t suffering untold torment envisioning the dirty, slovenly, no doubt ale-addled wastrel as he touched her with his filthy paws, \u201cmen were always super big on virginity for their women.\u201d</p> <p>His fingers itched for the rapier he\u2019d left at home. He\u2019d teach that odious, woman-defiling colonial a thing or two about sullying innocent, silky-thighed maidens!</p><p>\u201cI hate to say it, but your Google-fu must not be very strong if you missed turning up that fact.\u201d She glanced over her shoulder at him and smiled.</p><p>He bared his teeth in return. \u201cThis monster who deflowered you\u2014he isn\u2019t on the continent, is he?\u201d Oh, how he hoped for an answer in the affirmative.</p><p>Her eyes widened in surprise, then narrowed as she thought through what he had asked. \u201cMy first boyfriend? You mean Tony? A monster? You know, I\u2019d point out yet again that you\u2019re way over the line as far as what\u2019s politically correct by asking about him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst?\u201d He pounced on the word. \u201cGood god, woman, how many defilers have there been?\u201d</p><p>Her jaw dropped a little. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you just asked\u2014no. You didn\u2019t. In the interests of U.S.-Austrian relations, I\u2019m going to pretend you didn\u2019t ask me how many men I\u2019ve slept with. In fact, I think I\u2019m just going to pretend I don\u2019t know you.\u201d</p> <p>She turned her back on him again, sitting rigidly upright, careful not to touch him any more than she had to.</p><p>He didn\u2019t like that at all. He liked the idea of her having multiple lovers even less. And most of all, he didn\u2019t like just how much it mattered to him to find each and every man who had touched her, so he could lesson them within a hairsbreadth of their lives.</p><p>\u201cGoogle...fu...\u201d he growled, pulling out the journal and making another note. Then he added the name Tony, and a reminder to investigate the nearest ship sailing for the colonies.</p><p>He could have sworn she giggled, but she kept her back turned to him, and said nothing when they entered the outskirts of town. The silence lasted until she got a good look at buildings they were passing, and then all hell broke loose.</p><p>\u201cWhat the\u2014no!\u201d she wailed, pushing herself off his thighs, almost pulling him off the horse as she struggled to the ground. \u201cNo, no, no! This can\u2019t be! It just can\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe day I understand women is the day that I turn back into a normal man,\u201d he told Demeter, watching as Io ran first to one side of the road, then the other, yelling at the top of her lungs at the small houses that staggered in a drunken line toward the town square. \u201cI suppose I should stop her before she wakes up everyone.\u201d</p><p>With a martyred sigh, he dismounted. Io was spinning around the square, her hands clutching her hair, her eyes huge with genuine fear, visible to him even in what remained of the moonlight.</p><p>Something in him stirred at the sight of the fear. She didn\u2019t strike him as the type of woman who backed down from any challenge, and yet there she was, looking every inch the madwoman she claimed she was on the verge of becoming.</p> <p>\u201cCease this noise,\u201d he said sternly, striding toward her, the horses following him. He stopped and spun around to face them. \u201cStay there,\u201d he said, pointing to the ground.</p><p>Demeter lipped his finger and nickered at him. Thor bit her flank, and received a swift rear hoof to the chest in response.</p><p>\u201cStay,\u201d he repeated before turning back to Io. The horses followed him, just as he knew they would. He sighed yet another martyred sigh. When had anyone, his horses included, ever done as he ordered? \u201cWhat is the matter now, woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe town is the matter!\u201d Io wailed, her lower lip quivering. \u201cIt\u2019s not right! It\u2019s not the way it\u2019s supposed to be, and even if you guys were some weirdo reenactment group, you couldn\u2019t duplicate an entire town, could you? I mean, I can see that it\u2019s right where it\u2019s supposed to be, but it\u2019s not right, not right at all!\u201d</p><p>He put his hands on his hips and considered the town. \u201cI don\u2019t see anything amiss. It is not a large town, but it does have three inns, and four wells. I do not know of another of this size that has those amenities.\u201d</p><p>She quivered for a few seconds before wrapping her arms around herself. \u201cIt\u2019s...it\u2019s...oh my god, it\u2019s true, isn\u2019t it? It really is 1703. You\u2019re not pretending to be an Austrian duke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaron,\u201d he corrected.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t lost my mind. Well, except for the voices talking to me, but maybe that had something to do with the swirly thing, too, because that\u2019s what did this to me, Nikola.\u201d She took him by the edge of his lapel and shook him with a fervor that boded ill for his coat. \u201cIt was that swirly thing in the haunted woods. It sent me back in time. Me! Perfectly normal me! And now what the hell am I going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you wish to do?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cGo home!\u201d she answered quickly. \u201cBack to my own time, that is. Not home home, because there\u2019s nothing waiting for me there but unemployment and all sorts of stress and crap that I really don\u2019t need right now. But back to 2012.\u201d</p><p>He was silent for a few seconds, assessing her behavior. He hadn\u2019t ever run across anyone who\u2019d believed they lived in another time, especially not more than three hundred years in the future, but despite all her talk of losing her mind, and the abuse to his coat, she didn\u2019t strike him as mad.</p><p>Quite the contrary, she was reacting just as he thought he might should he be in her shoes. He ignored the memory of just how lovely her feet and ankles and legs and thighs were as she lay splayed on the ground, and instead asked, \u201cWhere is this phenomenon that you believe is responsible for you being here?\u201d</p><p>She started to answer, then stopped, releasing his coat and giving him a curious look. \u201cWait just one second.... You aren\u2019t telling me I\u2019m nutso-cuckoo.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her for a moment, then pulled out his journal. \u201cNutso-cuckoo.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s a flip way of saying deranged. How come you don\u2019t think I\u2019m crazy, Nikola? Why haven\u2019t you even said it\u2019s impossible for me to have traveled back in time?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI have ample proof that the impossible is often all too possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean because your son thinks he\u2019s a vampire?\u201d</p><p>He glanced around the square, taking her arm and pulling her toward the road that led back up the side of the mountain, the horses trailing behind them. \u201cThe term is Dark One, as I\u2019ve told you, and if you do not mind, I prefer to keep that news from the townspeople. Benedikt is young, and I have tried to shield him as best I can from the prejudice that arises from the unenlightened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute.\u201d Io frowned down at the road for the time it took them to walk past three cottages. \u201cI saw Benedikt and Imogen in my time\u2014whoa, I can\u2019t believe I just said that. Don\u2019t you think I\u2019m handling this whole impossible situation really well? I do. I think I should get some sort of commendation, or award, or at least a \u2018Didn\u2019t Go Insane When Others Would Have\u2019 tiara. Where was I? Oh, I saw both Benedikt and Imogen yesterday. That\u2019s my yesterday, not yours. Anyway, I just saw them, and they look a bit older than they do here, but not a lot older, not, you know, three hundred years older. Imogen looks like she\u2019s in her early thirties, and Benedikt a few years younger than that. How can that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was told that the children of unredeemed Dark Ones carry the stain of their father\u2019s curse; hence Benedikt is as immortal as Imogen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImogen is a vampire, too? Wow. So, that stuff about vampires being immortal isn\u2019t just folklore? It\u2019s really true?\u201d She was silent for a moment or two while she thought about that. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of scary, and yet at the same time, really intriguing. I mean, all that stuff Imogen must have seen firsthand! It kind of boggles the mind. And it would also explain why she looks so much younger than Gretl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour cousin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I just can\u2019t wrap my mind around the idea that Imogen is a vampire, too. She seems so normal. Does she drink bloo\u2014whoa Nellie!\u201d She stopped, spinning around to face him. Demeter bumped into his back when he, too, stopped. \u201cThe children of a Dark One? You mean you\u2019re a vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe established that fact earlier,\u201d he answered, pulling her forward again so Demeter would stop nibbling on the back of his head. He\u2019d gone out without a hat, a fact he now regretted considering the horse\u2019s propensity to graze on his hair. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe did? When did we do that? You mean\u2014\u201d She gasped, sucking in a huge quantity of air. \u201cOh my god you bit me! You\u2019re a vampire and you bit me! You drank my blood! I\u2019m going to turn into a vampire now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work like that, I\u2019ve found,\u201d he said, steering her forward once more. Honestly, if she shouted any louder, the neighboring towns could hear, as well. \u201cI believe you have to be cursed to this state, as I was. I\u2019ve fed off of many women over the past twenty-five years, and none of them have ever turned into a Dark One.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bit me!\u201d she repeated, her voice warming slightly as she obviously remembered the experience. It would certainly remain high on his list of memories. Just the thought of her warm, silky softness beneath him had him hard and aching, the hunger deep inside him rising to claim his mind, leaving him extremely aware that she was just a few inches away from him.</p> <p>He wanted her, wanted her in more ways than just to satisfy his hunger. He wanted to touch and caress and stroke every inch of her. He wanted to feast on her with all his senses, tasting and touching and licking. He wanted to join with her in the most fundamental way a man can with a woman, and he wanted it all right that very instant.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d she said, her eyes huge as she looked at him two seconds before she suddenly lunged, her arms and legs wrapping around him, sending him rocking backward into Demeter.</p><p>The horse sidestepped him, dammit. He hit the ground with a loud whump, but even Io\u2019s head impacting his chin didn\u2019t stop her. She tugged at his neckcloth until it was freed, baring his throat. He had just enough presence of mind to say in what he hoped was an outraged tone of voice, \u201cMadame! Unhand me! I do not find seduction on the road within view of town in the least bit arousing.\u201d</p><p>It was a lie, of course, since he didn\u2019t believe he could possibly be more aroused than he was at that moment, but a man had to have some standards, and making love to this delectable, enticing woman in the road was not one of them.</p><p>Now, if they moved onto the grass, that would be an entirely different situation.</p> <p>Io froze, her eyes growing large as she looked down at him. \u201cOh my god, I did it again! I attacked you! I can\u2019t believe I attacked you a second time!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t quite what I think of as an attack, although I would have appreciated a softer fall.\u201d He got to his feet when she rolled off him, her face suffused with color.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry! I can\u2019t believe I just jumped you like that. I have no excuse at all, except all of a sudden I was so...and I wanted to...and it was like I was hungry of all things, which I guess now that I think about it, I am, but this was a different kind of hunger. It was red, and pulsing, and so overwhelming that I just wanted to touch and taste and lick you\u2014\u201d She stopped speaking, snapping her teeth together before adding, \u201cI\u2019m sorry again. I shouldn\u2019t have said that. It\u2019s like I\u2019ve suddenly become Ms. Wholly Inappropriate Sexual Harassment.\u201d</p><p>He finished brushing himself off, looking at her and wondering. \u201cIt was red?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy face? Oh, yes.\u201d She marched off, her hands briefly rising to her cheeks, which he had to admit were a dusky rose. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how embarrassed I am. I just seem to lose all control around you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, the hunger you felt. It was red, you said?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m never going to be able to live this down, absolutely will never be able to live\u2014what? Oh, yes, red and hot and...and...\u201d She stopped and slid him a curious look. \u201cI\u2019m not going to continue or I\u2019ll end up shaming myself again, and really, I think I\u2019ve about reached the limit of things I can cope with in one night. Between unexpected time traveling and sexual moves on a man I don\u2019t know, who just happens to be a vampire who drank my blood...hey, do you think that could be why I want to jump you so bad? Maybe it\u2019s your fault. I think it is. I think you did something to me to make me want to do wholly inappropriate sexual things to you. Anyway, between that and the whole going-back-in-time thing, I think my brain is pretty much going to explode if I do anything else out of the ordinary, so I\u2019m just going to walk quietly and meditate to calm myself down. Om.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish to try an experiment,\u201d Nikola said after a few minutes\u2019 thought. He glanced around, making sure they were out of view of the town. Dawn was less than an hour away, and he knew the townspeople would be stirring with the coming light.</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of an experiment?\u201d Io asked suspiciously.</p><p>He pulled her off the road and into a field that had been left fallow, tall grasses skirting the edges of it. He leaned into her, not touching her, but allowing her scent to sink deep into his pores, the hunger immediately responding with urgent demands that he claim her.</p><p>She growled low in her throat, and flung herself on him again. This time he was ready for her, and braced himself, rocking back only a little as her body slammed into his. He thought for a moment or two that he might just die of pleasure when she bit his earlobe, his neck, and his chin, all the while scattering kisses, and murmuring words that didn\u2019t make any sense, but he felt such an extreme act on his part might be interpreted as being unappreciative, not to mention rude, so he held his ground and allowed her to have her way with him.</p><p>Until one of her hands snaked its way into his shirt and touched his bare chest. Then the hunger that he\u2019d been keeping so carefully leashed slipped his control.</p><p>\u201cWoman! You push me too far!\u201d He lowered her onto the soft grass, shredding her gown from where it hid her body from his eyes. She shrieked a little shriek that turned into a moan of pleasure when he bent over her, nuzzling his face in two delectable mounds of breasts where they were contained in some sort of abbreviated stays.</p><p>\u201cOh my god, yes!\u201d she cried, then suddenly began to struggle, shoving him over onto his back.</p> <p>He stared at her in surprise. Did she not want him the way he wanted her? \u201cYou say yes, but you thrust me away from your breasts and belly and those thighs that are begging for my mouth? I begin to believe your claim that you are deranged!\u201d</p><p>She stared at him for a moment in utter disbelief, then pounced on him, just as if she were a cat and he something hard and manly and about to spontaneously combust with the need to bite and taste and claim her once and for all. She bit and licked and murmured some more, all the while tugging and pulling at his coat and shirt until she had his upper parts bare. He thought of protesting such liberties, but in fairness, he had shredded her gown first, so he felt it was only right that she should have equal time with his garments.</p><p>\u201cNot the breeches, though,\u201d he told her when her hands wandered down to the buttons that kept him from bursting out into the open. \u201cMy daughter made them for me for my last birthday, and she would not like it if you, in your wild and unfettered female lust, ripped them off my body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo much talking!\u201d Io snarled, and, straddling him, leaned over his chest to take one of his nipples in her mouth.</p><p>He arched up, unable to articulate the sensation of her mouth, hot and sweet and so wonderfully wicked, on a purely mundane piece of his personal equipment. Yes, yes, there is entirely too much talking! Cease it immediately and do the other one!</p><p>She moved along his chest, her mouth burning a path over to where his second nipple was waiting impatiently for its turn. You taste so hot. Spicy hot, like the fire that burns inside of me. I want to bite you and taste you and ride you like you\u2019re a bucking bronco.</p><p>His eyes, which had rolled back in his head at the touch of her mouth on his nipples, promptly rolled forward again so as to enable him to stare down at the top of her head in surprise. What the devil? There was a voice in his head, a foreign voice, one that hadn\u2019t been there before. What was going on? Had Io somehow infected him with her voice-in-head derangement? Was that even possible?</p><p>She froze, slowly pushing herself upright. I\u2019ve infected you? That\u2019s...you? Nikola? You\u2019re talking in my head?</p><p>Goose bumps rolled along his body at the touch of her mind to his. This was extraordinary! He must, at once, take notes on the phenomenon, detailed and lengthy notes about exactly what was happening to him. Only by keeping the strictest scientific control over the situation could he learn from it. He would write a paper about it, and submit it to the best of the scientific journals. He would no doubt become the world\u2019s most preeminent expert on mind-talking.</p><p>How the hell are you doing that? Io asked, shifting backward.</p><p>All thoughts of the acceptance speech he would make when granted an award by whatever university first recognized his brilliance faded to nothing when Io\u2019s ass, her round, warm, so incredibly tempting ass, pressed his extremely erect penis, making him see stars for a few seconds. Her eyes opened wide a scant second or two before she rocked backward again, nearly causing him to spill his seed right then and there.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m doing it, but if you do not cease tormenting me with your derriere, I will do all those things you are thinking about, including the one where you are on all fours. And that one, as well, although I can\u2019t imagine being upside down like that would be very comfortable for you.</p><p>Aiee! she shrieked into his head. You can read my smutty thoughts! Oh my god! I\u2019m sexually harassing you and I\u2019m insane! Wait...if I\u2019m insane, then you are, as well, and you\u2019re thinking just as many naughty thoughts about me as I am about you. Oooh! Especially that one, Mr. Likes the Cowgirl Position. And for the record, don\u2019t knock the Kama Sutra, because that wheelbarrow position is made of all sorts of awesome. Er...so I\u2019m told.</p><p>\u201cThe what?\u201d he managed to gasp out as his mind was filled with the most erotic images he\u2019d ever in his life entertained. That they had their source in Io just made them all that much more irresistible.</p><p>\u201cKama Sutra. Old Indian sex guide. Not that I\u2019m going to have sex with you, because I don\u2019t do that with men I just met, even if my mind has coped with a lot of crap in the last few hours, and thus I\u2019d be excused to give in and jump you as you obviously wish to be jumped.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Despite his demands to the contrary (and her odious statement that she didn\u2019t intend to give in to the urges she was projecting to him), she slid backward down his body, her nimble fingers unbuttoning the fall front of his breeches. \u201cSweet mother of seriously fabulous penises! You\u2019re really...statuesque.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t wait for an invitation\u2014which was a good thing, since at that moment he fully believed that the power of speech and cognitive thought had abandoned him\u2014she simply reached out and took him into both hands.</p><p>And I thought the thing with the nipples was good, he moaned into her head shortly before falling back on the grass, his hands twitching spasmodically as she stroked him.</p> <p>Oh my god, you\u2019re so very hot. And hard. Your dick is like steel or something. That has to hurt.</p><p>It does, it does. A glorious hurt, he moaned again, his hips moving in time to her hands.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re talking to me. Right inside my head, you\u2019re talking to me. Thank god I\u2019m not insane. Although maybe I am after all because, Nikola, I really, really want to bite you.</p><p>His hips froze for a moment while he opened one eyelid and looked down at where she straddled his thighs, his extremely happy penis twitching slightly in her hands. \u201cRough bedsport is not enticing to me, Io. Although I did enjoy you biting me on the neck. If you insist on biting me\u2014and rest assured that I will reciprocate\u2014then you may do so there, but nowhere else.\u201d</p><p>She looked down at where he overflowed her hands. She looked up to his neck. Her gaze wandered back and forth between the two spots for a few seconds while the hunger in him surged and demanded to be sated upon her.</p> <p>\u201cDeal,\u201d she said at last, releasing his arousal and crawling up his body, her mouth hot on his neck before once again, she gently bit the corded tendon found therein.</p><p>He thought he might pass out from the pleasure her touch gave him.</p><p>You really like that, don\u2019t you? she asked, wiggling provocatively against him, her breasts still confined in their satin stays, some sort of matching undergarment clad about her loins. He wanted to object to that garment, but as the warm satin fabric covering her crotch pressed against his penis, he knew he was once again perilously close to emptying his stones.</p><p>I do, but not as much as I like this. He wrapped his hands around her delectable ass, moving her back and forth against him as at last he gave in to the hunger, biting the soft, silky flesh of her shoulder.</p><p>She moaned aloud while he drank, moving against him now with soft little urgent cries. His fingers slid beneath the material, around the soft globes of her ass to her warm, welcoming depths. She cried again, her body shaking as she shifted against him, pushing him past a point of all bearing. His fingers brushed against sensitive flesh, and sent her spiraling into an orgasm that triggered his own, his cry mingling with hers as it floated up into the predawn sky.</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d Io\u2019s voice interrupted his blissful sense of sexually sated oblivion. He opened his eyes and looked down to where she had pushed herself off his chest, her knees still clasping his hips. \u201cNow I can add dry-humping a stranger to my list of sexual harassment sins. Thank you, Nikola, thank you so very much.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d he said, sensing that for some reason she didn\u2019t mean the words literally. She seemed slightly annoyed, as a matter of fact. He wondered why that would be when she had enjoyed herself as much as he had. Could it be because he had spilled his seed on her undergarment, thereby staining it? He frowned at the undergarment in question.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing frowning at my lady parts?\u201d</p><p>Io sounded outraged.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not frowning at them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are. Your eyebrows are all pulled down between your gorgeous eyes, making me want to run my fingers along them to smooth them out. That, sir, is a frown, and it\u2019s directed at my nether bits. There\u2019s nothing there to frown at, I assure you. I pruned before I came to Austria, not that I expected to get it on with anyone, and especially not that we\u2019re going to hook up.\u201d She paused. \u201cOther than what we\u2019ve already done, obviously. But that\u2019s not really going gung ho forward, is it? It was just kind of quasi there.\u201d</p><p>He had absolutely no idea what she was going on about, so he focused on the one thing that did make sense. \u201cMy eyes are sufficiently smooth, thank you,\u201d he corrected her, still frowning at that part of her that was so tantalizingly close. It was true that the entire front of the pale peach undergarment was wet with his seed, but that wasn\u2019t what bothered him.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean. Why are you frowning at my crotch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am frowning at that ridiculous garment you are wearing to hide it from my view.\u201d</p> <p>She looked startled for a moment before looking down to where his penis\u2014now succumbing to a restful state\u2014lay against her pubic mound. \u201cMy...underwear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever it is called, I dislike it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Victoria\u2019s Secret, you boob! It\u2019s very expensive! I got it for myself last Christmas, before I was fired by my asshat of a boss. Besides, it matches the bra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what it matches, or whose secret it is, I dislike it because it keeps your flesh from meeting mine as is right and proper. Remove it immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I may have done things with you that I never do with a man I\u2019ve just met, but that doesn\u2019t give you the right to demand I remove my undies even if they are a bit ooky now because you got all excited on them. Not that I\u2019m holding you entirely to blame for that, since your vamp-biting thing made me crazy wild with lust. But still, it\u2019s not going to happen, so just get over it already.\u201d She got to her feet and stalked over to where the remains of her gown lay on the ground.</p><p>Nikola stared up at the lightening sky and considered and discarded a number of scenarios in which he showed Io that he was not the type of man who cared what others thought or felt, and decided, in the end, to be magnanimous. He would allow her to continue believing that she had every right to speak to him in that wholly irreverent manner, but only so long as it took to write his brilliant paper and receive his award. In the meantime, he would sate himself on her, giving in to the siren lure of her delicious person, and take his fill, then simply walk away from her and continue on with his life.</p><p>July 13</p><p>I\u2019m a bit embarrassed to write what happened early this morning. Oh, it was totally Nikola\u2019s fault, because it\u2019s obvious that he did something to my brain when he sucked my blood and all, but even with the vampire compulsion or thrall or whatever it is that vamps do to ensnare innocent women\u2019s minds and make them their love slaves, it was still me that jumped his bones. Repeatedly.</p><p>And enjoyed every damned second of it.</p><p>\u201cYou are wholly to blame for this,\u201d I pointed out to Nikola a short while after the scene on the side of the road.</p><p>\u201cA fact which I have admitted, and reassured you that I will replace your gown,\u201d he said in that yummy British accent he had. That voice seemed to do something to me, make all of my innards vibrate with happiness every time he spoke. I told my innards to cool it, that we\u2019d shamed ourselves enough for one day.</p><p>\u201cI was actually talking about the fact that you enslaved my mind with your lustful thoughts rather than the fact that you ripped my brand-new sundress to shreds,\u201d I corrected him, glancing down at myself. With my dress in tatters, I wore his shirt and coat, the former of which reached down to my knees since it was exceptionally long.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t enslave your mind.\u201d Nikola rode next to me, the rosy fingers of dawn managing to caress his bare chest and arms in a way that made my breath stop in my lungs. \u201cI cannot enslave anyone\u2019s mind.\u201d</p><p>I cleared my throat and dragged my eyes off him.</p><p>\u201cThen you enthralled me or did something to make me your love slave.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI\u2019ve just told you that I cannot do that. That\u2019s not to say I wouldn\u2019t if I could, because the idea of being surrounded by love slaves appeals to me, and being a man, I am naturally in need of many women to attend to my varied sexual needs, but unfortunately, I have not yet discovered that a Dark One can enslave minds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d love a herd of love-struck women swooning over you,\u201d I said with a glare at him. The dawg!</p><p>\u201cIt is the way of things,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>I was about to tell him what I thought of that sentiment when a thought occurred to me. \u201cYou said your wife has been dead for a bit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven years, yes.\u201d He shot me a curious look.</p><p>\u201cHow long were you married?\u201d</p><p>The look got significantly more pointed. \u201cSixteen years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did your wife think of you messing around with this great big herd of women that your manful lusts demanded?\u201d</p><p>He stiffened in the saddle, making his horse do a little side step that he quickly got under control. \u201cMadame, I can assure you that my wife never had complaints about me in that regard.\u201d</p><p>For some reason, his outrage made me want to giggle. Oh, I had his number all right\u2014he was all bark and little bite.</p><p>So to speak.</p><p>\u201cHowever, I have been without a wife for many years, and it is a well-known fact that men have sexual needs greater than those of women.\u201d</p><p>My amusement faded. \u201cYou are so\u2014that is utter and complete bullshit! It is not a well-known fact! It\u2019s a well-known fallacy put around by a bunch of horny men who want to justify having sex with every woman they can sweet-talk into bed, that\u2019s all. For your information, women have the same amount of sexual needs as men. Boy, you guys really did have some messed-up ideas about things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have read many scientific papers on the subject, and they all agree that men\u2019s needs are more prevalent and varied than women\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can stuff your scientific papers where the sun don\u2019t shine as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I gawked at him for a few seconds.</p><p>\u201cThe correct grammar is \u2018where the sun doesn\u2019t shine.\u2019\u201d He frowned as he thought. \u201cAlthough that is an odd thing to say. If you meant night, why did you not simply say \u2018at night\u2019?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know what the correct grammar is, you ignoramus! It\u2019s a saying. It means you can shove your outdated, woman-stifling, chauvinistic ideas up your butt.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows rose a quarter of an inch. \u201cI do not at all enjoy that sort of thing, either. And if you do, I regret to inform you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Thor, Imogen\u2019s horse, tossed his head around at my shriek. I lowered my voice and gritted my teeth. \u201cI don\u2019t like that, either, not that I\u2019ve tried it, but it\u2019s not something I intend to experiment with, so let\u2019s move past that, shall we?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who brought it up,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to literally stick something up your\u2014\u201d I took a deep breath, struggling to get a good, solid grip on my temper, which was not an easy task when Nikola seemed determined to drive me bonkers. \u201cI don\u2019t even remember how we got onto the subject of your ridiculous ideas about women and sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou accused me of making you my love slave, which is lamentably incorrect, because if you were my love slave, you would even now be impaled on my penis.\u201d</p><p>The image of that so filled my mind, I had to take a minute or two to get past it. \u201cEr...while we were on the horse?\u201d I eventually managed to ask, unable to keep myself from glancing at his lap.</p><p>His eyebrows rose again. \u201cIf you desire. I\u2019ve heard it can be stimulating, assuming both persons have good seats.\u201d</p> <p>That thought kept us both quiet for a short bit. After realizing that I was considering just where my arms and legs would go with regards to his saddle, I gave myself another mental scold, and returned to the matter at hand. \u201cI was simply pointing out that someone is responsible for my state of mind. How else do you explain the fact that I\u2019ve jumped you three times now?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at me with those wickedly gorgeous pale blue eyes, a little smile dancing on his lips. \u201cPerhaps you simply desire me as much as I desire you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe just met, and I\u2019m the sort of a woman who likes men for their minds, not their bodies. It\u2019s a well-known fact among my friends that I have to know a man for some time before I get sexually interested. Gretl says I\u2019m too picky that way, but it\u2019s just the way I am. So clearly, this whole situation with me wanting to do things to you is your fault, and not mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d That was all he said, but when he did so, he brushed a bug off his chest. Instantly, my gaze went to his bare chest, my hands tingling with the desire to stroke the lovely muscles that made up some really spectacular viewing.</p><p>Oh, dear lord, I was doing it again! Honestly, I wasn\u2019t such a ninny that I couldn\u2019t be near the man without wanting him to do all sorts of erotic things to me.</p><p>But I want to do those erotic things. Especially that one where you spread oil on us both and slither around on top of me.</p> <p>\u201cAnd you can stop egging on my poor, deluded brain! Besides, that\u2019s eavesdropping pure and simple, and I\u2019m not going to stand for it. Now, what we need here is to get organized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am completely organized,\u201d Nikola said blandly. \u201cEvery aspect of my life is orderly and well-thought-out. I run my house with a firm hand. My children and servants know that should they disorder that to which I have brought order, they will suffer the most grievous of penalties. Dedicated study to the unknown, order, and a calm clarity of mind are all my bywords. In short, madame, I am the personification of the word organized.\u201d</p><p>I murmured a word to myself that was not at all polite, and gave some thought to the situation. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that somehow that swirly thing in the woods was responsible for me being zapped back here. Therefore, I need to find it again, and let it send me back where I belong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have not fully explained this swirly thing, as you call it. What, exactly, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard to describe.\u201d I spent a few seconds summoning my memories, and explained to Nikola the happenings in the woods.</p><p>\u201cI do not understand this photograph that you keep referring to,\u201d he said after a long pause. He had pulled out his notebook from a pocket in his breeches, and made a brief note or two. \u201cNor why a cloud of smoke had the ability to alter time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe swirly thing wasn\u2019t really smoke\u2014it just kind of looked smoky. It was more like\u2014I don\u2019t know\u2014light, I guess. Swirls of light twisting around on itself. And a photograph is like a painting, only more realistic. It\u2019s a two-dimensional representation of an object or scene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d He made a few more notes. I smiled to myself. I\u2019d never thought that I was an overly curious person, but the fact that Nikola\u2019s interest in the world around him was clearly far more developed than mine tickled me.</p> <p>It also made me feel profoundly stupid about those things that people in my time took for granted.</p><p>\u201cAnd why were you in the woods to begin with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm? Oh, I was looking for a setting to take some pictures of Imogen, but she\u2014\u201d The words stopped as a memory of Imogen\u2019s face rose with horrible clarity in my mind.</p><p>Imogen refused to go to the woods because she said that\u2019s where her uncles had killed her father. Slowly, I turned to look at Nikola. He rode beside me, one hand holding the reins against his thigh while the other hand flipped through the pages of his notebook.</p><p>I was confused pure and simple\u2014Imogen said her father was killed in the woods one fateful night, while her brother had claimed he was alive and well and living in South America, enjoying the scantily clad women that abounded there.</p><p>My eyes narrowed at Nikola. I had no difficulty imagining him being in seventh heaven in such a surrounding.</p><p>But which of the siblings was right? Had Benedikt lied to me about his father being alive? Or had Imogen? And if Imogen was telling the truth\u2014a cold wave swept over me despite the warmth of Nikola\u2019s coat. \u201cThe anniversary of his death is in a couple of days,\u201d I said softly, repeating the words Imogen had spoken to me.</p><p>\u201cWhose death?\u201d Nikola asked, looking up from his notebook.</p><p>\u201cEr...no one\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>A chill swept over me. It was clear now that Imogen had been speaking the truth. No doubt she had told her younger brother a lie to keep him from being traumatized by the true events of that dreadful day.</p><p>None of that altered the horrible realization that Nikola could be in deadly peril. Possibly we were a few hours away from the day when, in some unknown year, Nikola would die.</p><p>What if it was this year?</p><p>That thought held me in its terrible grip the remainder of the trip back to Nikola\u2019s castle. By the time we got there, I\u2019d come to two conclusions\u2014one, that I needed to waste no time finding the swirly light thing, and returning to my own reality, and two, if it was at all possible to warn Nikola about his brothers\u2019 murderous intent without messing up the time-space continuum, or whatever it is that the people in Star Trek were always worried about whenever they time traveled, then I would do so.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to sleep with you,\u201d I told the empty room into which Nikola deposited me once we arrived at his castle on the mountaintop. \u201cBut Imogen is Gretl\u2019s friend\u2014will be Gretl\u2019s friend\u2014and for that reason, and because you were nice enough to let me wear your shirt, not to mention the fact that your chest holds an unholy fascination for me, because of all that, I will warn you about the evil plot your brothers are hatching. But that\u2019s it. Nothing more. No sex, no more nooky, nothing.\u201d</p><p>The fire crackling in the fireplace across from the bed was the only response to my bold statement. I sighed and sat down on the bed, wondering how on earth I was going to manage to keep myself from jumping Nikola the next time I saw him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing this on purpose,\u201d I said three minutes later when the door opened and Nikola strolled in, clad once again in a white shirt, long waistcoat of blue and gold, and midnight blue coat that reached almost to his knees.</p><p>\u201cYes, I am. I frequently have a purpose when I enter a room. I find that if I don\u2019t, I just wander around the castle bumping into things. Why aren\u2019t you in bed?\u201d</p><p>I gasped and clutched a beautifully embroidered pillow to my chest. \u201cI knew it! You just want to get into my pants! Well, I meant what I said, Buster Brown, so you can just put that in your pipe and smoke it.\u201d</p><p>Nikola frowned. \u201cI do not smoke a pipe. Tobacco bothers my daughter. You are supposed to be in bed. I instructed you to retire since you have fallen off a horse four times\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat last time was totally your fault! I told you to catch me and you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t aware you were going to dismount on the incorrect side. If you had done it properly\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I like that! I\u2019m the newbie at riding, so you should have made your dismounting instructions more comprehensive. And as for your instructions\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn addition to which you ran headlong into Heinrich with such force as to make yourself insensible\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was probably also your fault, too,\u201d I said darkly. Although most of my memory had returned, I didn\u2019t remember running into Nikola\u2019s carriage, as he said I had.</p><p>\u201cAnd finally, the exertion of attempting to seduce me on three separate occasions must all have taken its toll on your constitution, and thus you need rest.\u201d He finished with a little bow to me, hands making an elegant gesture that was heightened by the pretty lace at his wrists. Oddly enough, the lace didn\u2019t make him look effeminate\u2014quite the opposite, it enhanced the raw masculinity that he seemed to exude.</p><p>I was about to point out to him that I was a big girl, and perfectly able to determine when I needed sleep, but the truth was, I felt as if I were two inches away from shattering into a billion pieces of exhaustion.</p><p>The door opened before I could inform Nikola of my intention to get some rest. Imogen bustled into the room with her arms full of white linen.</p><p>\u201cPapa?\u201d she asked, giving him a curious look before sliding it toward me. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis is my castle. I own it. I inherited it from my father, your grandfather for whom you are named.\u201d Nikola frowned at his daughter. \u201cThus the answer to your question is that I am here because I have every right to be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father\u2019s name was Imogen?\u201d I asked Nikola.</p><p>He moved the frown over to me. \u201cOf course it wasn\u2019t. Imogen is a female name. My father\u2019s name was Fidele.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPapa, you should not be here. Miss Iolanthe is an unmarried woman in an advanced state of undress, and I will not allow you to take advantage of her,\u201d Imogen interrupted, setting down the stack of clothing on the corner of the bed. \u201cYou may leave, and I will attend to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWoman!\u201d He fairly yelled the word. \u201cI will not be gainsaid in my own home! If I wish to be here, in this room of the castle of which I am the lord and master, so that Io might seduce me again, then here is where I will stand, and there is naught you can say to me to remove me from the premises. Now begone, so that the lady might begin her seduction without an audience.\u201d</p><p>Imogen slowly turned to look at me, a speculative glint in her eyes. \u201cYou seduced my father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I would never! I just happened to jump him once or twice\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThree times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce or three times, not that anyone should be counting.\u201d I shot Nikola a potent glare. \u201cBut there was no seduction. It was just...er...how old are you?\u201d</p><p>Imogen\u2019s lips pursed for a moment. \u201cDoes my age matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does if you don\u2019t know about the birds and bees.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cWhat birds and bees?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a euphemism for...eh...men and women. Being together. Intimately.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSexual congress, you mean?\u201d She nodded. \u201cOf course I know about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do not!\u201d Nikola roared, pinning her back with a glare that should have ripped her hair right off her head. \u201cYou are a young and thoroughly innocent maiden!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course I am, Papa, but I have eyes. I\u2019ve seen the animals, and the people in town, and that really handsome stableboy with the very large...muscles.\u201d Her gaze dropped demurely, but I didn\u2019t believe for one second that Imogen was as innocent as Nikola believed.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t any of my business, however. \u201cThe fact is that I did not try to seduce your father, or rather, I did, but I was under the compulsion of the thing he did to brainwash me into thinking I wanted him right at that very second. And I don\u2019t. So it was all a mistake.\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips again. \u201cI see. You find my father handsome.\u201d</p><p>Oh, handsome wasn\u2019t the word for what Nikola was. He went far beyond that and hovered over the \u201cdevastatingly gorgeous\u201d range. \u201cI don\u2019t see what my opinion of Nikola\u2019s looks matters, but as it happens, yes, I think he\u2019s pretty easy on the eyes.\u201d</p><p>Nikola looked pleased.</p><p>You\u2019re also arrogant, pushy, and you have so many wrong ideas.</p> <p>You want me nonetheless. You want me naked on that bed behind you, covered in some form of lemon oil that I\u2019ve not seen before. You want to rub yourself on me.</p><p>Dammit, stop reading my smutty thoughts!</p><p>They\u2019re about me. I would be remiss in my hostly duties if I did not offer the common courtesy of being interested in what devilish things you wish to do to my man\u2019s body. Next time you wish to have sexual fantasies about me, however, please let me know in advance so that I might enjoy them, too.</p><p>\u201cHow old are you?\u201d</p><p>Imogen\u2019s question took me a bit by surprise. \u201cEr...thirty-something.\u201d I glanced at Nikola. \u201cAs long as we\u2019re playing twenty questions, how old are you? Not that I care in any way, shape, or form, because we are not going to have a relationship, despite you offering yourself for seduction, but it will make me feel a lot better about the way you made me jump you if I know you\u2019re not young enough to be emotionally scarred by the circumstances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was two score when Imogen was born, and that was a little more than a score ago,\u201d he said, his frown growing darker. \u201cImogen, I have ordered you to leave this chamber. Why have you not done as I have commanded?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Iolanthe\u2014I\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t know your surname\u2014is obviously in need of assistance since you managed to remove almost all of her garments before bringing her home,\u201d Imogen said mildly. \u201cI know my duty, and that is to ensure her safety while she is under our protection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will see to any protecting that needs to be done,\u201d Nikola said firmly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one I need protecting from,\u201d I said, throwing grammar to the wind. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid to be alone with anyone else, least of all Imogen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere, you see?\u201d Imogen shooed her father toward the door. To my surprise, Nikola allowed himself to be shooed, casting belligerent looks over his shoulder toward me. \u201cI will take care of her, Papa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnhand me, daughter! I will not be treated in this manner!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course you won\u2019t,\u201d Imogen said soothingly, and then more or less shoved Nikola through the door, ignoring his sputters of protest. She closed the door behind him and turned around to face me, a faint smile on her lips fading away to nothing.</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t need help, but I appreciate the offer,\u201d I said, wondering at the odd look she was giving me. \u201cI hate to give your father the satisfaction of being correct, but I am very tired, and wouldn\u2019t mind a little nap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have brought you some night things,\u201d she said, moving to the stack of linen on the bed. \u201cAnd also a gown, because yours was destroyed by Papa. Although I\u2019m not sure I understand why that is so, since he\u2019s normally a very circumspect man. Perhaps you would care to enlighten me?\u201d</p><p>I clamped my lips closed on the truth. Although Imogen was certainly old enough to know her father had a sexuality that was normal and natural, I had no idea if eighteenth-century women were copacetic discussing such things, especially when it concerned a parent. So instead I smiled and thanked her when she held out a lacy, frilly nightgown.</p><p>\u201cIs it true that you ran into Papa\u2019s carriage horse?\u201d Imogen asked as she puttered around the room, picking up Nikola\u2019s shirt from where I tossed it in order to slip into the nightgown.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what he says. I don\u2019t remember anything about it. Imogen\u2014\u201d I bit my lip, not sure how to ask her the question I wanted most to ask. \u201cAbout your father\u2014he has two brothers, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you wish to know that?\u201d Imogen countered, a small frown pulling her brows together.</p><p>I took a deep breath and gave up trying to tie all the little ties on the front of the nightgown. \u201cThis is going to sound completely crazy, and I don\u2019t blame you one bit if you think I\u2019ve gone insane, but I\u2019m from the future. Your future, that is.\u201d</p><p>She just looked at me for a few seconds, then pulled a wide, armless chair over, and sat in it. \u201cI don\u2019t see what that has to do with my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to even question the idea that I am from the future?\u201d I asked, completely surprised by her apparent nonchalance in accepting such a bizarre idea. \u201cIf the situation was reversed, I\u2019d totally be calling the local loony bin for you.\u201d</p><p>Imogen\u2019s frown increased for a few seconds. \u201cI do not know this loony bin. As for what you claim...\u201d She made a delicate shrug. \u201cI do not believe or discount what you say. I merely am inquiring what that has to do with my father\u2019s family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt matters because we\u2019ve met. Or we will meet. In my time, I met you two days ago, and one of the things you told me was that your father had been killed by his brothers. I just want to know if that\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can hardly be true if my father is alive, which he is.\u201d Imogen\u2019s voice may have been light\u2014and slightly tinged with a mocking tone that I could have done without\u2014but her expression was grave.</p><p>\u201cI meant, does he have two brothers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she answered.</p><p>I sat on the edge of the bed, wondering what the present-day Imogen had been up to, since she had obviously been lying to me.</p><p>\u201cHe has two half brothers, younger sons of my grandmother when she married a second time.\u201d</p><p>A chill swept over me despite the warmth from the big fire. I shivered and clutched a puffy eiderdown around me. \u201cHalf brothers. That\u2019s right, you said half brothers. Those are the dudes.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThey are not here. They live in a small town to the north. They\u2019ve never gotten along with Papa, so he gave them a small property he owned, where they could be their own masters and not be beholden to him.\u201d</p><p>I racked my brain, trying to remember what Imogen had told me about her father\u2019s death. Was there something about the brothers being jealous of him? \u201cWhereabouts do they live, exactly?\u201d</p><p>She named a town that I didn\u2019t recognize, adding, \u201cWe see them twice a year, once on Papa\u2019s birthday, and the second at the anniversary of my grandmother\u2019s death, but neither event is for some time. Why would my uncles want Papa dead?\u201d</p><p>I just looked at her, unsure how to answer. I didn\u2019t want to cause her more pain by admitting her uncles were jealous of Nikola\u2019s luck in being born first, and thereby being the heir to a castle and title, but on the other hand, she deserved to know the truth. Assuming it was the truth. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t know all the details, because when we met\u2014in 2012\u2014you didn\u2019t say much other than the anniversary of your father\u2019s death was coming up, and that he\u2019d been killed in some woods by his two half brothers. I think you said something about them being jealous, but I can\u2019t really remember for sure. So much has happened since then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said he was killed in a woods? What woods?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t know. You just said woods, and from what I could tell in the dark coming back here from the town, this whole region is covered in woods. Then there\u2019s the weird woods that held the swirly thing that brought me back in time\u2014Gretl said it was haunted, and that people in the area had avoided it for a long time. But that reputation is understandable given what happened to me there. I don\u2019t know where that is, either, since my memory seems to be incomplete, but I plan on searching for it as soon as I\u2019ve had a little nap. Does your father have a favorite spot in the woods he likes to visit?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot that I know of. He likes to go hunting, but he does that in a number of places.\u201d Pain flickered across her face as she clasped her hands together. \u201cI can\u2019t thank you enough for coming back through the centuries to make sure this tragedy will not happen. Truly, it is a miracle that you are here with us now. Fate has indeed been kind to us in that you have been sent to save Papa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really believe in fate that way,\u201d I said slowly, more than a little uncomfortable by the fervent light in her eyes. \u201cI believe people make their own futures, rather than being a bit of flotsam that gets picked up by some random happenstance. But back to the subject at hand\u2014I guess if your uncles aren\u2019t around, then this wasn\u2019t the year your father was killed, which frankly makes me very happy because I don\u2019t want to see anyone killed, let alone someone as lickable as Nikola. Likable! I meant likable! Not lickable at all.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged again. \u201cI do not mind that you find my father sexually attractive. He is attractive, and my mother has been dead for many years. He is lonely. He desires women, but does not take them when they are offered to him. It is most perplexing. My brother says\u2014but you are not interested in that. I must consider how best to approach the subject of my uncles with my father. Needless to say, I am grateful that you have traveled so far to save him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbout that...\u201d I said with obvious hesitation. \u201cSee, the thing is, I didn\u2019t come back in time to save Nikola. That is, I would if it was feasible, although your dad is kind of bossy and has some seriously antiquated ideas. He seems very nice once you get past those points, even if he is a vampire, but there\u2019s more to saving him than showing up and warning him that at some point in the future his brothers are going to off him. For one, we don\u2019t know when that is going to happen.... Wait a sec.\u201d A faint memory returned to me. \u201cYour dad said he was more than three score, right? A score is twenty years, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019s over sixty?\u201d I shook my head. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t look older than maybe thirty or thirty-two at a stretch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is a Dark One. They do not appear to age unless they desire to do so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotcha.\u201d I let go the idea that I was turned on by a sixty-plus-year-old vampire, and focused on what was important. According to Nikola, Imogen was just twenty, and the faint memory I had of her saying she was twenty-two when her dad died told me exactly when the event was going to happen: two years in the future.</p> <p>I closed my mouth on that knowledge, though. If saving Nikola had the potential to mess up the future, the thought of how things might change if either Imogen or he was in possession of the date of his death was even worse. \u201cIf only we could get around this stupid paradox,\u201d I murmured more to myself than to Imogen.</p><p>\u201cParadox?\u201d She was back to frowning again. \u201cWhat paradox?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one that happens if you change the past. OK, it\u2019s been a moot point up to now, but there\u2019s been a lot of speculation about what would happen if you changed something minor in the past. The most popular conclusion is that even something so simple as stepping on a bug could have major ramifications down the line. So imagine how something as big as stopping a man being murdered could affect the future.\u201d</p><p>Imogen crossed her arms. \u201cAre you saying that you will allow Papa to be killed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all. At least...\u201d I bit my lip. \u201cAt least not until I can figure out a way to do that without upsetting the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs your future life so important that you would allow my father\u2019s life to be taken from him?\u201d Imogen demanded, suddenly reminding me of Nikola at his most outraged.</p> <p>\u201cMy life is no great shakes, no, but that\u2019s just my situation. There are millions of people out there who probably have perfectly wonderful lives, and saving Nikola might change that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why,\u201d Imogen said scornfully, getting to her feet. \u201cHe is but one man. I shall consider best how to deal with this situation. Until then, you must get some sleep, or you will not be recovered enough to feed my father.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at her in surprise. \u201cHow did you know that Nikola had knocked back a pint or two of my blood?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged a third time. \u201cThere is something about you that tells me you have allowed him to feed from you. That is good. I believe it will do much for him to have someone he admires be the source of his nourishment. Now, if you will excuse me, I must think upon all that you have told me. I must warn him, Miss Iolanthe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIo, please. Iolanthe is such a mouthful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must call me Imogen, then. Io, hear me\u2014I cannot let my father be harmed, even if we have no proof that my uncles would do anything so heinous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know, but there\u2019s the whole messing-up-time thing to consider....\u201d I gnawed on my lip again. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to act rashly by rushing the situation. It\u2019s not like your dad is in danger right now.\u201d And wouldn\u2019t be for another two years.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not, but I will not risk his life for anything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThink, but don\u2019t act. At least not yet,\u201d I warned her. \u201cI really don\u2019t want to go back to a future where lizards are ruling the world because we warned Nikola about his future trip out into the woods with his brothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile I, on the other hand, would prefer anything to seeing my father destroyed.\u201d She gave me a look that said I should be thoroughly ashamed of myself, which I admitted I was. The door closed softly behind her, leaving me in a warm, silent room.</p><p>\u201cNow what am I going to do?\u201d I asked the room.</p><p>No one answered.</p><p>\u201cThanks a lot, life!\u201d I climbed into bed, and gave in to the exhaustion that had been pulling at me with leaden fingers.</p><p>Nine hours and a handful of minutes later, I sat at a table and stared down at the plate before me. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d I leaned forward and sniffed. My nose wrinkled in response. \u201cWould you mind if I asked if this meat is fresh? Because it\u2019s seriously green on that edge, and brown on the rest, and I don\u2019t think meat is supposed to smell like that.\u201d</p><p>The thin young woman who had gravely informed me her name was Elizabet adjusted her ruffled headwear\u2014some sort of cap with a bit of dirty ribbon tied around it\u2014while holding an obviously stunted arm against her midsection. She said with a sniff, \u201cMaster loves pheasant like this. Cook made it especially for him a week ago Sunday.\u201d</p><p>I flinched and pushed the plate away from me. \u201cYou know, I think I\u2019ll just save this for Nikola, then. I\u2019d hate to deprive him of his rancid pheasant. You wouldn\u2019t happen to have some fruit, would you? Apples? Peaches? Something like that? Maybe with a piece of bread? Fresh bread,\u201d I added hastily, not wanting to appear like a demanding guest, but at the same time not willing to risk my intestinal happiness.</p><p>\u201cAye, if you like, although Master says no one does pheasant like Cook.\u201d</p><p>I said nothing more, just smiled as she took the plate and a tankard of murky-looking water back to the kitchen.</p><p>I wandered out of the small sunny breakfast room a short time later in possession of two apples, and a cup of goat\u2019s milk. I drank the latter, and was munching on one of the former while considering what I needed to do.</p><p>Obviously, locating the woods and returning to my own time was the top priority. Second to that, but much less important, was the opportunity to examine what life was like in the eighteenth century. If only I had my camera, I could document my amazing experiences. \u201cHmm. That\u2019s not a bad idea, actually. Hey, you, footman...\u201d</p><p>The flaming servant with the salmon-colored wig sashayed into the room, pausing to admire himself in the surface of a highly polished silver urn that sat on a small table in the main hall, his lip curling at me in an \u201cI smell dog poop\u201d sort of expression. \u201cMy name is Robert, not footman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Robert. Do you happen to know if there is some paper and something to write with that I could use?\u201d</p><p>The footman, with another expressive curl of his lip, allowed that there was writing paper in the ladies\u2019 sitting room. I toddled off to a small room at the back of the house, pausing at the entrance when Imogen looked up from where she sat at a beautiful oak writing desk.</p><p>\u201cOh, my apologies. I didn\u2019t know anyone was here. Robert said there was some paper here. I thought I might just make a few quick notes about what I\u2019ve seen and done for historical purposes. I didn\u2019t mean to interrupt you. I can come back another time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, do not leave.\u201d Imogen rose from the desk, folding a piece of paper and tucking it up her sleeve. \u201cThere are many household tasks for me to perform now that Papa is home. You are welcome to use my desk and stationery to make your notes.\u201d She smiled, and paused at the door. \u201cPapa loves to take notes about things. Benedikt\u2014that is my brother\u2014Benedikt is forever teasing Papa that he should be an alchemist, but Papa says he\u2019s already discovered the secret of perpetual life, and does not wish to discover anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh? Oh, because he\u2019s a\u2014\u201d I made bitey motions with my fingers.</p><p>Imogen nodded.</p><p>\u201cThis is really personal, but do you drink blood like your father? You never said anything about that when I met you in my time, not that I suppose you would announce to a total stranger that you were a vampire and all, but still, you don\u2019t look at all how I imagine vamps look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am a Moravian, not a vampire,\u201d she said primly, then gave a negligent one-shouldered shrug. \u201cI can drink blood if I desire, but I much prefer wine. I will leave you to your notes. If you have need of more paper or quills, ring the bell.\u201d</p><p>It took me a bit to get used to the quill and ink method of writing, and I managed to spill ink all over one sleeve of the pretty dress that Imogen had loaned me (she had wanted to give me one of gold brocade and old rose watered silk, but I managed to talk her down to something she called a work dress, which was a flowers-and-birds-patterned cotton dress that opened in the front to reveal a pale green underskirt), but soon I mastered the quill and was happily scratching away on some hand-laid paper. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I fully intended to make only brief notes, but once I got started, it seemed important to get down every bit of what I had seen and done, lest I forget about this amazing trip to the past.</p><p>I shook my head at myself as I wrote, murmuring, \u201cI still can\u2019t believe how well I\u2019m coping with both time travel and a hunky vampire. I seriously need an award or something.\u201d</p><p>What seemed like a few minutes later, the footman Robert came into the room to deliver a tray with a beautiful teapot and accompanying accoutrements.</p> <p>\u201cThe lady Imogen, she says you will take the tea,\u201d Robert said, setting it down rather carelessly. I grimaced, my eyes on the delicate teapot.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds lovely, and be careful! That\u2019s an antique!\u201d</p><p>Robert\u2019s perfectly plucked eyebrows rose almost to the hairline of his wig as he glanced at the teapot. \u201cIt is not. The monseigneur, he had it brought back with him from Paris a few years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, in my view it\u2019s an antique, and a very nice one, so be a bit more careful of it.\u201d</p><p>Robert rolled his eyes dramatically and, with a spin that would do a model on a catwalk proud, sauntered to the door.</p> <p>\u201cWhat time is it, do you know?\u201d I asked, stretching. I was surprised to find I was slightly stiff from sitting at the writing desk.</p><p>\u201cIt is half after five of the clock. Lady Imogen desires to know if you will be taking supper with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive thirty? Holy time sink, Batman! I\u2019ve spent four hours in here?\u201d I looked down at the stack of papers splotched and smeared with ink, and admitted that I\u2019d done just that. \u201cBoy, time gets away with you when you\u2019re writing. Um... Imogen wanted to know about dinner? No, I don\u2019t have time for that. I have to go search the woods for my swirly thing. But first, I need a potty break. Please tell me there\u2019s a contraption downstairs like the one in that tiny room upstairs?\u201d</p><p>I gave a little shudder at the memory of my time at the toilet upstairs.... It was more like a camping toilet than a real one, with some sort of a wooden cabinet built around a chamber pot\u2014complete with lid\u2014but evidently flush toilets hadn\u2019t yet been invented. I wondered what else hadn\u2019t been invented yet. Indoor plumbing and electricity, obviously. But what about important things like health care? Did they even have real doctors at this time? The one I\u2019d been going to see when I thought I was deranged had turned out to be a vet. What if they still used leeches to cure people?</p><p>I shuddered again at just how perilously close I had been to being leeched. That was just one more reason to find the swirly time-travel portal.</p><p>\u201cContraption?\u201d Robert asked in a wholly uninterested voice. \u201cI do not know this contraption.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe toilet. Or...um...chamber pot. Is there one downstairs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOui. There is the privy next to the kitchen garden. There is also the chambre du convenience in the rear of the stairs. Lady Imogen prefers that to the privy, since she says Master Benedikt has the aim most terrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, there\u2019s some TMI fodder. Thanks, I\u2019ll find it.\u201d I tidied up the papers as best I could, hoping Imogen wouldn\u2019t notice the ink splashed all over the leather top of her writing desk. \u201cAnd now, I should go find the swirly thing.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ll gloss over my experience with the convenience (you may thank me now). When I was done, and had the one-handed maid Elizabet help me readjust all those skirts\u2014and make me incredibly thankful that I had turned down Imogen\u2019s offer of a corset, preferring to stick with my own bra instead\u2014another half hour had passed, and I was fast running out of time to search the woods.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I told myself as I marched with determination down the hall. \u201cTime to get to business. First, I\u2019ll get a horse. Then I\u2019ll start with the woods near the spot that Nikola said I ran into his carriage. Then, I\u2019ll make sure the swirly thing is there, and after that...\u201d</p><p>My words trailed away, my feet stopping at the same time, leaving me standing in the middle of the hall. What would I do if I found the woods and the swirly portal? Would I just pop through it to my time without so much as a good-bye to Nikola?</p><p>That didn\u2019t seem right. I might not want to sleep with him\u2014my mind skittered over that lie without so much as pointing it out\u2014but that didn\u2019t mean I was happy to leave him at the mercy of his brothers. What if Imogen didn\u2019t tell him about their intention to kill him? What if she did tell him, but he, being a man and thus prone to the stubborn belief that he knew best, either didn\u2019t believe her or didn\u2019t take action in time?</p><p>What if he died and it was my fault?</p> <p>Robert swished his way into the hall in a swirl of dirty lace, a faint halo of pinky orange powder around his giant wig.</p><p>\u201cJust the person I wanted to see. Do you know where Nikola is?\u201d I asked, hurrying toward him.</p><p>He backed away from me with one hand daintily clutching a scrap of linen to his nose.</p><p>\u201cMais oui, of course I know. The monseigneur is where the monseigneur always is at this time of the day\u2014in his study with the tools astronomiques, and the bodies of the things most dead, and the little cow maid whose cream he favors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCow maid whose cream...\u201d I squared my shoulders, outrage inexplicably filling me. Dammit, I would not allow myself to care if he was scarfing down the cow maid or her cream. Nikola might be Mr. Historical Sexy Pants, but that did not mean I had to give in to those urges that had already led me astray three times with him. \u201cI refuse to give him that satisfaction! Not again, anyway. I have standards, and it\u2019s about time I start standing by them. Just where is this den of iniquity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStudy, not den. It is directly above us,\u201d Robert answered, dismissing me with a disinterested wave of his hankie before he continued his way through the room.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, the world would be better off without such a dawg,\u201d I growled to myself, firmly intending to march out to the stables to ask for a horse.</p><p>Which would explain why I was so surprised when I found myself not only upstairs but standing in front of a door that I assumed led to Nikola\u2019s study.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I told the door. \u201cI\u2019ll just tell him what I think of him dining at Caf\u00e9 Io when he has a cow maid on tap. So to speak. Then it\u2019s back on track, and to the stable for a horse before going off to the woods to find my way back home to sanity.\u201d</p><p>The door opened just as I was reaching out to knock at it. Nikola leaned against the doorway, his arms crossed over his chest. \u201cDo you always talk to people through doors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was talking to myself, thank you very much,\u201d I told him with a scowl, looking past him into a dimly lit room. \u201cWhere\u2019s your cowgirl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. I, on the other hand, find it much more efficient to speak to someone while she is in the same room as me. No doubt you, having been raised in the colonies, will view that as an odd method of conversing, but I can assure you that it is a standard practice in civilized countries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat part of \u2018talking to myself\u2019 didn\u2019t you understand?\u201d I asked him, a bit annoyed at his attitude. \u201cAnd for the record, in my time the U.S. is a major world power, so you can just knock off the condescending tone, buster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name is Nikola, not Buster. You seem to have difficulty remembering that.\u201d He tipped his head to the side in a way that made my knees melt. Once again I was overwhelmed with the urge to fling myself on him and kiss the living daylights out of him. \u201cI wonder if that is due to a personality flaw, or if it\u2019s something that you\u2019ve picked up from living with savages?\u201d</p><p>I took a deep, deep breath, and was preparing to blast him when he gave a little wave of his hand. \u201cIt is of no matter. Since you are busy conversing with yourself, I will return to my studies. Good day.\u201d</p><p>He shut the door in my face. I gawked at it for a moment, unable to believe he\u2019d done that. A little titter from down the hallway had me glaring at Elizabet, who held a coal scuttle with her good arm.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s crazy as a loon, you know that, right?\u201d I asked the maid.</p><p>She grinned. \u201cWe\u2019re all a bit daft here, Mistress Io. Even my own da says I\u2019m not right in my head for leaving England and coming to a foreign country to work for the baron, but I say it\u2019s how you\u2019re treated that matters, and the baron treats us like people, not animals what don\u2019t have no feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say he wasn\u2019t a good employer, just that he\u2019s not going to be awarded a Sane Person of the Year award.\u201d I took another deep breath\u2014just because I felt I needed one\u2014and, without knocking, opened the door and entered Nikola\u2019s study.</p><p>Instantly, I felt as if I\u2019d stepped into another world. Which I had, given the whole time-travel thing, but this...\u201cThis is amazing,\u201d I said on a long breath, gazing in wonder around the room. It was L-shaped, with the short end to my left, while to the right ran the long side, sunlight pouring through the tall windows, illuminating intricate Middle Eastern carpets that dotted the floor. There were numerous tables of all sizes, from petite round ones to long, solid-looking desks bearing stacks and stacks of papers, books, and odd bits of equipment. A mechanical bird perched in a black iron cage sang as I stumbled forward, too intent on seeing everything to watch where I was walking. A marble mortar and pestle nestled up against a sphere depicting the constellations, which in turn sat on top of mechanical sketches that looked very familiar somehow. I headed toward them, my eyes widening even further when I extracted the top sheet of sketches, and recognized it.</p><p>\u201cThis is a da Vinci drawing of an airplane,\u201d I said, showing the sheet to Nikola, who sat behind a monstrously large ebony desk crowded with even more books. \u201cA real da Vinci!\u201d</p><p>Nikola looked up from where he was tinkering with a three-foot-tall mechanical statue of an African, complete with turban and spear. \u201cOh, it\u2019s you, is it?\u201d</p><p>I walked over to him, weaving my way around stacks of books piled on the floor, a tray with tea things, and two ginger-colored cats who were curled up together in front of a fire. \u201cIt\u2019s a da Vinci, Nikola.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He looked at the paper. \u201cSo it is. Not a very practical design, though. But I liked some elements of it, particularly the wings. Stretching skins over the wooden frame to mimic a bird\u2019s anatomy is very intriguing, very intriguing indeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand. This\u2014\u201d I found myself shaking the paper at him, and forced myself to gently set it down. \u201cThis is a da Vinci. An original. It should be in a museum! It\u2019s priceless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it is,\u201d he answered, returning his attention to the mechanical statue. \u201cI bought several notebooks full of those sorts of drawings, but didn\u2019t see much that seemed very reasonable. Creative, but not terribly useful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot useful...\u201d I murmured to myself, staggering over to a tall armchair before falling into it. I lifted a wan hand and gestured toward Nikola. \u201cWhat is it you\u2019re doing there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorking on my automaton. It freezes up after just a few turns.\u201d He glanced over at me again. \u201cDid you want something in particular, or did you just come to tempt me with your breasts and thighs and all the bits in between?\u201d</p><p>At the mention of breasts, I sat up, leveling a glare at him. \u201cI\u2019d have thought you had enough of that with this cow maid person that everyone says you\u2019re hot on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHot?\u201d He blinked a couple of times, then extracted his notebook from a stack of papers. \u201cUsed in this context, what is the meaning of the word?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare be all endearingly adorable by asking things like that!\u201d I stood up and pointed a finger at him. \u201cI\u2019m onto you now, buster! You\u2019re deliberately being cute so I\u2019ll forget about the cowgirl and let you dine at Ristorante Io. Well, it won\u2019t work, do you hear me? I will not be charmed!\u201d</p> <p>He set down a small tool, and leaned back in his chair, considering me. \u201cThen I will stop my unceasing and yet obviously futile attempts to sway you with my considerable erudition. Are you here because you believe I need feeding, and that only you can perform that function? If so, I will take this moment to reassure you that I will not trespass on your good nature by doing so again. There are ample numbers of men and women in the village who have provided me with sustenance for the last thirty-nine years, and will continue to do so for at least another thirty-nine more. Assumedly more, since I am now immortal, but I don\u2019t like to presume. You may take your blood and begone, woman. I have no need or desire for either you or it.\u201d</p><p>By the time he finished that little speech, he had gotten up and moved around to where I stood, pulling me to my feet until I was pressed against him, the hard lines of his body making all my soft, squishy bits cheer with happiness.</p><p>\u201cStop touching me,\u201d I told him, and leaned in to nip his lower lip.</p><p>\u201cI have no desire to\u2014\u201d</p><p>His words stopped when his mouth descended upon mine, his tongue instantly barging into my mouth in a manner just as arrogant as its owner.</p><p>Oh, you have desire, I said, feeling the passion flaring to life in him like a burst of electricity. You have oodles of desire. Oh, dear lord, right there, do that again!</p> <p>His hands had slid down to my breasts, cupping them and teasing them mercilessly, all the while his mouth was driving me insane with want and need until I felt just as electrified with desire as he did.</p><p>I may have misspoken, he admitted, his tongue mapping out my mouth before retreating back into his own. I find myself wanting you more than I\u2019ve wanted anything I can think of.</p><p>The feeling\u2019s mutual, I started to say, then remembered my good intentions of keeping my distance from him.</p><p>Slowly, with more strength of mind than I thought I had, I managed to push myself back from the warm, solid, so very alluring man, and stepped back, one hand on my mouth. My lips felt sensitized, like they, too, had been touched with electricity.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you come here?\u201d he asked, his eyes a smoky navy color. Evidently when he became aroused, his eyes grew darker. It was a bizarre phenomenon, and yet at the same time one that intrigued me to no end. I wondered if there was a way I could control how his irises shifted in color.</p><p>\u201cHere as in your study, or here as in 1703?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither. Both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you how I came to this year. As for being in your study right now, I wanted to ask you to help me find the swirly thing that brought me here,\u201d I heard myself saying. I was a bit surprised at that last bit, since I didn\u2019t remember even thinking such a thing, but once the words were spoken, it seemed to make sense. Who better to hunt for the exact place I\u2019d popped into this world than the man who lived here?</p> <p>Nikola glanced over my shoulder to the row of windows. \u201cIt\u2019s early evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sun still has an hour to set, and one of the things I\u2019ve learned over the last thirty years is that sunlight does not agree with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right, you\u2019re a vampire.\u201d I gave him a weak smile. \u201cI keep forgetting that. Well, I can go hunt for the spot by myself, but I don\u2019t remember anything about where I emerged, so I kind of hoped you\u2019d come with me.\u201d</p><p>He toyed with a metal file that he had been holding before he had kissed me. \u201cI might be persuaded to spend my evening in such a search, should the company interest me enough.\u201d</p><p>I stiffened. \u201cIs that some sort of a slur? Because if it is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was an invitation for you to use your feminine wiles upon me, and tempt me with promises of much pleasure to come should I accede to your wishes.\u201d I swear his eyes glittered with humor.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s what that was. And here I thought you were just making a dig at me. Well, since you want pleasure...\u201d I dropped my eyelids and gave him a smoldering look. \u201cHow about we do something really fun?\u201d</p><p>His eyes started to go dark again. \u201cWhat would that be?\u201d</p><p>I smiled at the fact that his voice was a bit rough around the edges, but before he could grab me, I snatched up the da Vinci page and held it up. \u201cWhat do you say we go put this in the eighteenth-century equivalent of an archival protective frame?\u201d</p><p>Nikola was silent for a moment before saying in a conversational tone, \u201cIf, in the time it takes me to count to four, you do not put down that drawing which for some inexplicable reason you value so highly, you will regret it.\u201d</p><p>I glanced from the drawing to his face, wondering if he was pissed.</p><p>His eyes were midnight blue.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said on a breath, and had just barely placed the paper back on the desk before I found myself on my back before the fire, the two ginger cats scooting over with disgusted looks at us. \u201cNikola, I don\u2019t want to make love to you.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s not what your body tells me.</p><p>\u201cI am not responsible for my body\u2019s actions,\u201d I said, my breath coming fast and hard as Nikola paused in the act of removing the cloth around his neck, and his jacket. I flinched at the look he gave me. \u201cI didn\u2019t just say that, did I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did.\u201d He continued to remove his clothing until he was clad in nothing but his breeches and stockings. \u201cBut I find the unique twist of your mind quite entertaining. You are unlike any other woman of my acquaintance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take that as praise, because...well, because it feels like praise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was. Since your body desires me physically, would you mind if I indulged it in some acts that I will personally guarantee to bring it exquisite pleasure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I mind. I really don\u2019t want to make love to you, Nikola.\u201d</p><p>He did that head-tipping thing that was so damned adorable, I just wanted to punch him in the face. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>It took a few minutes to find the words, a situation that was not made any easier by the fact that his bare chest and arms were distracting me almost to the point where I just tossed all my good intentions to the wind and flung myself on him. \u201cI\u2019ve told you\u2014I don\u2019t become involved with men until after I\u2019ve known them for a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not how you feel toward me, however,\u201d he pointed out, damn his delectable hide. \u201cYou desire me. I can feel the strength of that desire, one that is more than matched by my own for you. What is wrong with allowing those desires to merge?\u201d</p><p>I was still on my back, a little fire warming one side (the castle was, I had discovered, slightly chilly even in the summer, probably due to all that thick stone). Above me was an even warmer man, one who I could feel meant every word he said\u2014he found me very desirable, and was prone to thinking some of the most erotic thoughts I\u2019d ever entertained. I was in a century that was not my own, and might in a few hours be back where I belonged, leaving any physical relationship in which I might wish to indulge myself wholly uncomplicated or fraught with emotional entanglements.</p><p>In short, I could have my cake and eat it, too.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, because I\u2019m afraid that once might not be enough,\u201d I admitted, hesitant to bare the truth.</p><p>\u201cWho says it has to just be once?\u201d He trailed a fingertip down the exposed flesh of my collarbone, making me arch up to his hand.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stay here, Nikola. Who knows what horrible repercussions I\u2019m already having on the future? To stay longer is to risk all sorts of trouble.\u201d</p><p>He leaned over me, his hands on either side of my head. His eyes, that handy-dandy barometer to his emotions, were the color of the summer sky. \u201cAnd if I asked you to remain with me? Would you stay? Would you give up your own time for mine?\u201d</p><p>Luckily for my peace of mind, I wasn\u2019t forced to answer that question\u2014not that I had the slightest idea what I\u2019d say, because to be wholly honest, just having him so close to me made common sense seem like the most ridiculous attribute ever\u2014but because at that moment, the door was flung open and an agitated Imogen burst into the room, scattering words behind her.</p><p>\u201c\u2014and I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing here when they never come here before December, and it\u2019s all going to be just like Io said, and I\u2019m afraid of lizards and don\u2019t want them ruling the earth, but only Io knows when and where, so really, it\u2019s up to\u2014oh!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Imogen looked from her half-naked father leaning over me, to where I lay prone on the ground, my hands somehow having found their way onto his arms, where they might have been stroking his biceps in a wholly shameless manner.</p><p>\u201cImogen. Hi. Um...this isn\u2019t what it looks like,\u201d I stammered, snatching my hands back from Nikola\u2019s silky flesh.</p><p>\u201cIt looks to me like Papa is seducing you,\u201d she said with a frown at her father.</p> <p>\u201cThat is exactly what was happening. If you leave us now, I will continue, although your interruption has no doubt broken the mood, which means I will have to begin all over again with Io, and it is no easy task to seduce her when she is in one of her resistant moods.\u201d</p><p>I gawked at him. \u201cYou say that like all I do is resist you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I remind you that I was the one who seduced you first? I jumped you three times before you got around to reciprocating.\u201d</p><p>He grinned (which melted my innards) and kissed me on the tip of my nose. \u201cAnnoyed, sweetling?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot in the least. I told you that I wasn\u2019t interested\u2014\u201d It took until that moment for Imogen\u2019s words to register in my smut-riddled brain. I shoved Nikola back and sat up, looking over to her. \u201cDid you say lizards? You don\u2019t mean...\u201d</p><p>She nodded, her gaze unreadable as she watched her father, with an exaggerated sigh, pull on his shirt and fancy embroidered waistcoat. \u201cMy uncles are here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d I shook my head. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be here for two more years. Er...that is, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s nothing, Imogen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArnulf and Rolf are here now?\u201d Nikola did not look happy as he pulled on his boots. I got to my feet and hiked up the neckline of my dress. It had a tendency to expose more boob than I was comfortable seeing displayed. \u201cThey should not be here for months.\u201d</p><p>Imogen sent me a look fraught with anguish.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I told her. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be just a coincidence.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOne that could have dire repercussions,\u201d she argued.</p><p>\u201cI sense that you are excluding me from this conversation, and I do not enjoy the sensation. You will both cease it immediately, and tell me of what coincidence and what repercussions you are speaking, not to mention how lizards are involved, or what it is that only Io knows.\u201d</p><p>Imogen watched me for a few seconds as I wadded up a handful of the gown I was wearing, not sure how to begin to broach the subject of Nikola\u2019s demise. I wasn\u2019t even convinced I needed to at that point, since his half brothers\u2019 arrival could be nothing more than a coincidence.</p><p>Could it?</p><p>14 July 1703</p><p>Nikola disliked mysteries. He disliked mysterious women who ran into his horses, he disliked people having conversations around him that were deliberately intended to not be understandable to him, and most of all, he disliked the feeling that something was going on to which he was not privy.</p><p>That, along with sexual frustration, general hunger, and a desperate need for Io to admit that she wanted him as much as he wanted her, all contributed to a surliness that was evident in his greeting to his half brothers.</p><p>\u201cWhat the devil are you doing here?\u201d he demanded as he stomped into the sitting room where two men of middling years lounged with more ease than grace.</p> <p>\u201cEver the charmer, eh, Nikola?\u201d Rolf said with a sneer on his thick, oily lips.</p><p>Nikola considered his sibling with distaste. Both men were in their early sixties now, and time had not sat well on their countenances. Balding, with a fringe of brown and white hair, Rolf tried to disguise his enormous belly by means of stays that creaked and groaned when he walked. Arnulf was as thin as his brother was round, his body full of angles and sharp points that hurt just to look at.</p><p>Although Nikola had tried to love his half brothers as he should, he had never been close to them. Far from it, the two had always mocked him, made fun of his scientific interests, dropping sly innuendos about a range of subjects, and generally conducting themselves in a manner unpleasant to the point where he resented them intruding upon his well-ordered life. \u201cWhat is it you want?\u201d</p><p>Rolf, the elder of his two brothers, smiled, showing blackened broken teeth. \u201cDo we have to want something to visit our dear brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou usually do, yes. If it\u2019s an increase on your allowance that you\u2019re after\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have an allowance,\u201d Arnulf said, stepping over his brother\u2019s sprawled legs to stand in front of Nikola. \u201cWe\u2019re your brothers, for the lord\u2019s sake. Our mother\u2019s estate should have been handed over to us as was right and proper!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she had wanted you to have it, she wouldn\u2019t have given it to me to hold in trust,\u201d Nikola said, wearily wondering how long he could bear the company of his brothers, and whether it wouldn\u2019t save them all grief if he just had them removed from the house now.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you convinced her we were unworthy!\u201d Arnulf snapped, and clearly would have continued the timeworn argument had not Rolf interrupted.</p><p>\u201cWe have not come for an increase on the allowance, brother,\u201d he said with another of his oily smiles. With a grunt, he hoisted himself to his feet. \u201cWe are here to discuss a matter of the gravest importance, one which, once we determined its veracity, we knew would require your immediate attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of a matter?\u201d Nikola asked, despite his intention to get rid of his brothers. Damn his curiosity\u2014he had never been able to quell it as he would like.</p><p>\u201cA highly personal one. It seems, brother dear, that someone close to you, someone very close to you, desires to see you\u2014\u201d</p><p>The door behind him opened as Io and Imogen entered the room, the latter arguing quite forcibly with the former.</p><p>\u201c\u2014don\u2019t tell him, then I will be forced to. It\u2019s just too dangerous for him not to know.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed on Io. What is too dangerous for me not to know?</p><p>Io looked startled for a few seconds, before glancing over to his brothers. Er... I think we may need to have a talk.</p><p>One involving lovemaking? I approve of this plan.</p><p>Er...</p><p>\u201cI have no time to hear whatever it is that you believe is so important,\u201d he told his brothers, grabbing Io\u2019s arm and pulling her toward the door. \u201cIolanthe wishes to feed me, and as you know, I hold true to the precept that one should never discommode a lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPapa!\u201d Imogen said as they left the room.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look so shocked, sweetling\u2014your uncles found out the truth about me years ago. Now, my little strudel,\u201d he said as he closed the door behind them. \u201cLet us go to my bedchamber so that we might have this talk you so fervently wish for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, you don\u2019t. And stop reading my smutty thoughts. Just because my mind and body want you to do all those things you\u2019re thinking about... Really, Nikola? Do you have a tub big enough for that?... Just because the rest of me says, \u2018Oh, lordy, yes, let\u2019s get down and boogie\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re going to.\u201d</p><p>He paused at the foot of the stairs and gave her his best smoldering look.</p><p>She just thinned her lips at him and crossed her arms over those delicious mounds of breasts that he knew were created just for his satisfaction.</p><p>Right. The smolder was out. He switched it to a pathetic pleading expression. Surely she couldn\u2019t resist that. \u201cIt shall be as you wish, of course. I do need to feed, but I will find another.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw tightened, and her eyes narrowed until they were tiny slits. Damn. Perhaps he had been wrong trying to make her jealous.</p><p>He sighed, and said with as much pathos as he could muster, \u201cOr I can just wait until such time as you see fit to feed me. It won\u2019t be easy controlling myself around you when I am so hungry, but your wishes come first.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes at that, and punched him in the arm. \u201cOh, like I don\u2019t see through that shallow attempt at passive-aggressive manipulation? Please, my mother was the master of it. I\u2019ll be happy to let you...er...dine...but our discussion should probably wait until we have some time for a really long explanation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I have a quick nibble now? One that won\u2019t take much of your time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike any nibble you take is going to be quick? I know exactly what you\u2019re thinking, buster, you just remember that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA light repast, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She punched him in the arm again.</p><p>\u201cA sip or two. That\u2019s all, I swear.\u201d</p><p>She considered that for a moment, but unfortunately, his gaze drifted down from her face to her breasts, and soon his mind was filled with all the things he wanted to do to them.</p><p>She crossed her arms again. \u201cDo you seriously think I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing, Mr. Guilt Trip? You\u2019re not even that hungry, so don\u2019t give me those big blue puppy dog eyes. I\u2019ll feed you later, when we have time to talk. How come your half brothers are here? Imogen said they shouldn\u2019t be here until Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey wished to impart some important message to me. They were about to do so when you burst in and distracted me with your adorable breasts, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThighs, and all the parts in between, yes, I know,\u201d she told him with a look that made him grin. \u201cNikola, I meant it when I said I don\u2019t have sex with men until I\u2019ve known them for some time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long, in whatever measure of time you choose, does \u2018some time\u2019 translate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll know when it\u2019s happened,\u201d she told him, turning to face Imogen when she emerged from the sitting room, his annoying brothers on her heels.</p><p>\u201cPapa, I really must tell you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cImogen,\u201d Io interrupted, hurrying forward to take his daughter by the arm and tug her down the short hall to where the ladies\u2019 withdrawing room was located. \u201cI think we should continue our conversation before you say anything more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s something I neglected to tell you,\u201d Io said with emphasis, and with a quick glance back at him hurried Imogen off.</p><p>Are you plotting something? he asked, mentally gnashing his teeth at the sensation of being left out of the discussion. Are you planning on asking my daughter\u2019s permission to ravish me as I deserve? If so, please take heed when she informs you that I am lonely and need a woman in my life. She\u2019s been nagging me for the last five years to find one.</p><p>In your dreams, bat boy.</p> <p>Bat boy? What the devil did that mean? He was making a note of it in his notebook when Rolf jostled his arm, sending the tip of his pencil deep into the paper of the notebook.</p><p>\u201cWe need to speak to you about this situation,\u201d Rolf said, shooting a glance down the hallway into which the ladies had disappeared. \u201cPrivately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat situation?\u201d Nikola put the notebook away, irritated by all number of things\u2014his brothers\u2019 presence, the fact that Io was being so determined to not be seduced, and this air of mystery that clung to her and Imogen, to name just a few items. The last thing he wanted to do was to spend time closeted with his two annoying brothers.</p><p>\u201cThe one we told you about,\u201d Rolf said, struggling to hide his exasperation. \u201cThe one involving a grave threat to you.\u201d</p><p>Mostly it was Io who claimed his thoughts. Why was she being so insistent that they not give in to their mutual desire? She acknowledged that it existed, so logically it made sense for her to allow him to seduce her.</p> <p>\u201cWe must speak with you, but it is too dangerous to do so here.\u201d</p><p>And yet, the sad truth was that things had progressed much further when she was seducing him, rather than vice versa.... Nikola froze, the whole of his attention arrested by that sudden observation.</p><p>\u201cAye, Rolf speaks the truth. There are some here who should not be trusted, some who are very close to your bosom,\u201d Arnulf added.</p><p>What if he let Io seduce him again? It would solve all the problems, since it would allow her to be in control\u2014women always liked to feel they were in control of situations, especially those regarding lovemaking\u2014not to mention it would take care of all her notions about having to know him for some unspecified length of time before they could proceed along natural lines of engagement.</p><p>\u201cWe must speak to you somewhere away from the castle, where we can\u2019t be overheard.\u201d Rolf leaned in close to him. Without thinking, he shied back. \u201cSomewhere we can tell you all that we know.\u201d</p><p>Engagement. He frowned as that word echoed in his head. Was that the reason Io was so hesitant to engage in lovemaking? Was she saving herself for marriage?</p> <p>\u201cHow about that woods where we found that stag a few winters back?\u201d Arnulf suggested. \u201cThe one halfway between the town and here.\u201d</p><p>No, that couldn\u2019t be. She admitted she had lovers in the past\u2014he spent another few seconds mentally grinding his teeth over that irksome fact\u2014which meant her innocence was long gone.</p><p>\u201cAye, that would be a good spot,\u201d Rolf agreed. \u201cExcellent suggestion, Arnulf. Do you know the place, brother?\u201d</p><p>Perhaps, though, she was seeking a husband. Women did that. Would she expect him to make her an offer of marriage? Personally, he had been in Io\u2019s company enough to know that he wouldn\u2019t mind spending the next fifty or so years with her at his side, but he had buried one wife, and didn\u2019t know if he could go through the pain of watching another woman he cared for die.</p><p>\u201cYou know the spot we\u2019re talking about, don\u2019t you, Nikola? There\u2019s a clearing in the center of it, from what I can remember. We could meet there and tell you the truth about those closest to you. What\u2019s the name of the woods? Sauber? Sauston?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZauberwald,\u201d Nikola said without thinking, his mind busy on the conundrum that was Io. The second the word was spoken, however, his attention shifted. He ought to know the spot\u2014it was where thirty or so years ago he had run into a demon lord, and been cursed into his present state.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s the spot, Zauberwald. The so-called enchanted forest.\u201d Arnulf smiled before adding, \u201cAlthough I\u2019ve never seen what was supposed to be so enchanting about it.\u201d</p><p>Nikola frowned as he eyed the two men before him. \u201cWhat about it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is the ideal place for us to have a meeting, dear brother. One that will, I\u2019m afraid, open your eyes to the true nature of those who are around you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the devil are you talking about now?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Rolf laid a finger on his lips, glancing over Nikola\u2019s shoulder to where the footman had just entered the hall. \u201cTonight. Shall we say midnight? In the Zauberwald, at the center. All then will be made clear.\u201d</p><p>It was on the tip of his tongue to refuse, since he had hopes that at that time of the evening Io would be in the middle of seducing him, but there was a slight chance that she might not yet understand that he was no longer pursuing her.</p><p>\u201cAs you like,\u201d he said, turning on his heel and heading toward his study. \u201cI have business to attend to. You will no doubt entertain yourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf that, you can have no fear,\u201d Arnulf called after him as he left the hall. There was a slight tone to his youngest brother\u2019s voice that rubbed him the wrong way, but now, he told himself as his boot steps echoed in the side hallway that led to his study, was not the time to worry about such mundane irritations. Now was the time to focus on alerting Io to the fact that she was free to seduce him at her convenience.</p><p>How very hungry I am, he projected to Io an hour or so later, as he worked on his automaton. He allowed the red, biting sensation of the hunger to claim him for a few seconds, knowing that she would feel that, as well. I shall need to find sustenance soon.</p><p>I said I would feed you later. I\u2019m busy with Imogen right now.</p><p>Busy with what, may I inquire?</p><p>None of your beeswax, she said curtly, and closed her mind to his before he could attempt to broach it and see just what it was she was doing in such secrecy.</p><p>His steward brought work that demanded his attention then, with concerns of the estate, following which he was obliged to visit the stables and attend to Old Ted regarding one of the mares due to foal at any moment.</p><p>Have I mentioned that I dislike intensely women who adopt an air of mystery in order to captivate a man?</p><p>Have I mentioned that I dislike intensely men who barge into women\u2019s heads without at least knocking first?</p><p>Knock, knock.</p><p>Oh, very funny. There was a slight pause. I\u2019m not trying to captivate you, Nikola. I just want to... Her voice trailed off in his head.</p><p>What? he inquired, curious.</p><p>The echo of her thoughts came to him so faintly, he wasn\u2019t absolutely certain he heard it. Save you.</p><p>Save me?</p><p>What? The word was spoken with a sense of Io being startled.</p><p>You said you wanted to save me.</p><p>I did not!</p><p>I heard you. \u201cSave you,\u201d you said, and since you can speak only to me in this manner, you must have meant that it was me you wished to save.</p><p>You\u2019re imagining things, she said somewhat desperately, followed immediately by another echoed thought, this time of an oath.</p><p>And now you just swore at me. I heard that, too.</p><p>Argh! she yelled in his head. Stop talking to me!</p><p>Why?</p><p>Because I\u2019m busy!</p><p>Doing what?</p><p>Argh, she yelled again.</p><p>I dislike this sense of mystery you insist on having around me, he pointed out.</p><p>I know you don\u2019t like it, and I don\u2019t really care, so just mind your own business and leave me alone.</p><p>You should care. You\u2019ll never seduce me if you don\u2019t pay attention to the little hints I have been giving you about how best to tantalize and entice me.</p><p>Seduce you? Are you insane? I just got through telling you, numerous times as a matter of fact, that I don\u2019t want to have sex with you. Why on earth would I want to seduce you?</p><p>From what do you wish to save me? he asked, congratulating himself on neatly turning the conversation back to that subject. My own lust? If so, I must tell you that the only way to save me from that is to apply your nubile, smooth body to mine.</p><p>That\u2019s it, it\u2019s official, you\u2019re completely bonkers. Now stop talking to me so I can figure out how to keep the future from being destroyed.</p><p>That seems an odd pastime, but since you are determined to seduce me at your own pace, I will allow you to get on with it. But you should be aware that I will be busy for the next few hours, and thus will be unavailable to perform those sexual acts about which you are even now thinking.</p><p>Silence followed that statement for the count of twenty. She hadn\u2019t been thinking of anything erotic, at least not that he was aware, but the second he mentioned it, she did.</p><p>He smiled to himself.</p><p>I\u2019m not thinking of any sex acts! she protested, but it was a feeble protest, and they both knew it. Dammit, all right, I am, but only because you\u2019re putting them in my head. Stop putting your smutty fantasies in my head, Nikola!</p><p>I have done nothing of the kind. You are thinking about how you wish to touch and lick me, and to sit astride me and take me into yourself. Although I\u2019m quite willing to allow you to do those things to me, they are not my fantasies. These are my fantasies. He let her see some of the things he wanted to do to her.</p><p>You bastard, she swore, and immediately pushed him out of her mind.</p><p>He laughed, delighted and charmed by her personality as much as the way her mind worked, and, of course, by that luscious body that by now he was convinced was created just for his enjoyment.</p><p>By the time he had attended to some overdue correspondence, taken a stroll out with the gamekeeper to discuss the current stock of wildlife on his lands, and avoided his brothers\u2019 company, dinner was upon them.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Robbie,\u201d he asked as he stood in his bedchamber, clad in only a dressing gown, \u201cis the water not hot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it not?\u201d The footman pursed his lips and looked thoughtful as he stood at the end of the squat metal bathing tub.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it is not sufficiently hot. You know I desire my bathwater to be very hot. I have told you that every week for the last four months, since you insisted on taking up the duty of bringing my bathwater. I have told you that I wish for it to be boiling before it leaves the kitchen, so that it will be a suitable temperature for bathing by the time the tub has been filled.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Robert shrugged. \u201cIt was hot when I checked last. Perhaps you should check again. Perhaps it is hotter than you think.\u201d</p><p>Nikola, about to remove his dressing gown and bend over the tub to do just that, paused and slid a glance over to where the footman was watching him with a hopeful expression. He sighed. He didn\u2019t mind being the subject of unrequited lust, but he preferred that the luster be of the female gender. It just made things easier that way. \u201cLeave that can of water, and you may go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, monseigneur\u2014the water, she is not the way you desire.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRobert\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will fetch you more water, very hot water, steaming water that will make little beads of moisture appear on your chest.\u201d</p><p>Robert\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, monseigneur!\u201d Robert held up a hand to stop his protest. \u201cIt is no trouble. You must have the water most hot so that it slides across your belly just like the, how you say it, slithering of a tongue.\u201d</p><p>Nikola took a deep breath, picked up the tall metal can of by-now-lukewarm water, and emptied it into the tub. \u201cThis is fine. You may leave.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may leave!\u201d</p><p>Robert, pouting a little at the stern command, minced on his exceptionally high heels around the screen that protected the tub from drafts, and on to the door. He sniffed, but exited the room without further incident.</p><p>Nikola divested himself of his velvet dressing gown\u2014the castle was always chilly, especially in the evening\u2014and got into the tub, busily washing himself while he thought of Io, and how he was going to get her to seduce him again.</p><p>A brief flurry of cold air alerted him to the fact that someone had come into the room. He sighed to himself, about to tell Robert that he had no need of any further services, especially those of an intimate nature, when a hesitant voice spoke. \u201cNikola?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIolanthe?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cListen, I wanted to talk to you really quickly\u2014\u201d She came around the end of the screen and stopped, her eyes huge. \u201cOh! You\u2019re having a bath! I had one a little bit ago. You have really weird tubs, but at least the water was nice and hot. Um. Nikola, you\u2019re naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I am also wet.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened even more as her gaze flickered between his face and his chest, and knees. \u201cSo you are. You don\u2019t fit in your tub. Your legs are all scrunched up. Why don\u2019t you get a bigger tub, one you can sit in properly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would take an inordinate amount of time and water to fill. Did you desire something in particular, or did you just wish to see me at my bath? Is this an attempt at seduction? Because if it is, you must first allow me to get out of the tub, since there isn\u2019t room in it for both of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I don\u2019t want to seduce you\u2014\u201d She stammered a little before swallowing. \u201cI...er... I wanted to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d Casually, he rose from the tub. Nikola was not an overly modest man, but he was very aware of her gaze as it crawled across his naked flesh when he reached for the bath linen to dry himself.</p><p>She just stared at him for a few seconds, her eyes now moving from his groin to his chest and back to his face. \u201cUm...what?\u201d</p><p>He took in her flustered expression, and decided to make things easier for her. \u201cIs it my penis?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHuh?\u201d She looked at the object in question.</p><p>He gestured toward it. \u201cYou seem to be looking at it quite a bit. And yet, you\u2019ve seen it before. Does it, for some reason I am unable to fathom, now startle you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She stared at his groin in fascination as his arousal at her inspection of his body quickly became apparent.</p><p>\u201cAh. Then I must assume you wish to caress it, and perhaps take it in your hands as you did earlier this morning. Dare I hope that you might wish to indulge in that most wicked of all practices, and use your mouth instead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I don\u2019t want to touch you or give you a hand or blow job. I don\u2019t give a hoot about your penis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you still staring at it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d she said mendaciously, her gaze locked on his nether parts. Her fingers twitched.</p><p>\u201cIo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish to make love to you, and feed from you, and then possibly make love to you again, because the way you are staring at me makes me think I would be able to achieve a second bout of lovemaking immediately following the first, not that I\u2019ve successfully done so in the past, but if there was a woman who could ensure such a thing is possible, you are that woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo many words,\u201d she said, and as he was half expecting, she lunged at him, flinging herself with wild abandon that he wholeheartedly appreciated.</p><p>He was ready for her, though, and backed up with her in his arms until he bumped into the bed. He allowed her to push him down onto his back, his hands busily divesting her of one of Imogen\u2019s gowns that had obviously been lent to her.</p><p>\u201cI have never, ever felt this way about a man,\u201d she murmured as she swept her hands up his chest, her fingers tracing out all the muscles in his arms and upper torso. \u201cMy god, you\u2019re really ripped. Like, work-out-at-the-gym sort of ripped. I didn\u2019t think people in the past could have a six-pack, but you actually do have one. You must do a lot of physical stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ride,\u201d he answered, pulling off the gown and her chemise, leaving her in the odd matching short stays and undergarment that hid all her warm, delectable secrets from him. \u201cI hunt when needed. Imogen likes to go for walks, and many times, I accompany her. I taught my son swordplay, and he and I spent many months working on his technique. How do you remove the stays?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe what, now?\u201d She bent down to swirl her tongue around his nipple. He saw stars for a few seconds.</p><p>\u201cYour stays. The ones confining your breasts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called a bra, and it unhooks in the back. Nikola, this is wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re right, it does unhook in the back.\u201d He pulled the stays off her, his hands immediately filled with her sublime little breasts. Just enough to fill each palm, he thought with satisfaction as he rubbed his thumbs gently over the little brown nipples.</p><p>She moaned, and arched back, thrusting her breasts into his hands. Not that, this is wrong. Us. Together. And the fact that damn you, you\u2019re right, I do want to seduce you. Again. My god, I must be insane, but I want you more than I\u2019ve ever wanted a man.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite sane, I assure you, since I feel the same way about you.\u201d He pulled her down to a kiss that scorched his mouth, the feeling of those pert little breasts pressing against his chest enough to fill his mind with hunger\u2014for both her blood and her body. He slid his hands over her hips to the undergarment. It had no hooks on the back of it, so he assumed it simply slid off her legs. He pulled her upward, peeling the abbreviated garment from her body, reveling in the heat of her as she grasped his hips with her knees.</p><p>\u201cI really did intend to just talk to you,\u201d she moaned again as he pulled her forward enough to take the tip of one of those tempting breasts into his mouth, laving his tongue over it. Her fingernails stung his shoulders as she clutched him, her head thrown back, her chest heaving in time with his mouth as he paid homage to first one, then the second breast. \u201cJust talk, that\u2019s all. I didn\u2019t intend to jump you again, but dammit, Nikola, you were naked! Wet and naked! That\u2019s more than any woman can bear! Oh dear god, do my left boob again, please.\u201d</p><p>He obliged her, ignoring the drawing sensation in his privates, aware he was perilously close to spilling his seed again, but determined to give her the time she needed to make up her mind once and for all.</p><p>\u201cI meant what I said\u2014I really don\u2019t do this with guys I\u2019ve just met,\u201d she told him as she slid down his body, rising up and grasping his penis with a firm hand that made him twitch with anticipation. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t happen! I\u2019m not programmed that way. Although really, when you think about it, you\u2019re not like any other man, are you? So it makes sense that I\u2019m reacting to you in a way that I\u2019ve never done before. Because I\u2019ve never met a vampire before. That makes sense, right?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t have the slightest idea what she was babbling about, but he was happy to agree with her, since it appeared that she had, at last, worked out in her mind the fact that they were meant to indulge in all the things they both had been thinking. \u201cIt makes perfect sense. I am unique. As are you. I have never met a woman from the future. Therefore, it is a sound conclusion that you should impale yourself on me at this exact moment, and I will happily lose myself in your heat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds a bit crazy when I explain it,\u201d she continued on, \u201cbut it feels right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt feels very right.\u201d He gave a little lurch upward and moaned in happiness at the resulting sensation of her hands around him.</p><p>\u201cThis is just one of those situations where common sense doesn\u2019t apply, I think. I don\u2019t suppose you have any condoms?\u201d</p><p>He frowned at her, automatically reaching for his notebook, but it was across the room.</p><p>\u201cNever mind, I\u2019m on the pill, although if I go home with some sort of weirdo eighteenth-century STD, I will personally geld you. Are you ready?\u201d</p><p>She held him poised at the entrance to her gates of paradise. He could only nod; his penis was so hard at that point, it could probably have been used to hew stone.</p><p>\u201cOK, but just so you realize that I don\u2019t normally do this.\u201d Her eyes closed in rapture as she sank down on him, enveloping him with warmth and heat the likes of which he\u2019d never experienced.</p><p>A thousand velvety muscles seemed to ripple around him as she moved, easing him into her heat, allowing the invasion of him in a way that once again had him seeing stars.</p><p>\u201cMy god,\u201d she panted as she moved gingerly on him, slowly making her way down his length until her pubic bone rested against his. \u201cThis is...man, you\u2019re just there, aren\u2019t you? It\u2019s like...wow. It feels so good.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt will feel better if you move,\u201d he advised her, amazed he could actually speak, so overwhelming was the sensation of being buried inside her.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know, but this is good, too.\u201d She flashed him a grin, then leaned down to nip his lower lip, her eyes growing wide when he shifted his hips, causing him to slide a little more into her.</p><p>It was as if he\u2019d set a torch to a keg of gunpowder. She moved in a rhythm that seemed to leave him mindless, his whole being focused on her, and the pleasure that she was pouring into his mind. He pulled her tighter to him, licking a spot on her shoulder, asking her wordlessly for permission.</p> <p>Yes, she groaned into his mind, her hips moving in an erotic dance that he knew would drive him over the edge in just a matter of seconds. Oh, yes, please, Nikola. Feed. Take it from me.</p><p>Her flesh was warm and smooth against his mouth, but the moment he bit deep, and her life flowed into him, he knew that she had captured more than just his fancy.</p><p>July 15</p><p>The postorgasmic glow wasn\u2019t the only thing that knocked me out, but it did contribute to the effect. I\u2019d like to blame the mouse in my room for the bulk of the reason that I was so tired after seducing Nikola that I conked right out afterward, missing dinner and, more important, missing the fact that Nikola roused himself from his own snooze, and had toddled off.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, you blame a mouse? What has a mouse done to you?\u201d The vindictive round lady with the big fat gray curls stood over me as I struggled to get into all the various layers of clothing that women wore at that time. \u201cYou are trying to confuse me with talks of this mouse, but you will not do so! I can see through your ways! I know you for what you are\u2014the devil\u2019s bed partner! I will listen not to you, and so I shall advise Fr\u00e4ulein Imogen, for she is of the tender heart and innocent mind, and she will not see you for what you truly are.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe devil\u2019s bed partner, yeah, yeah\u2014dammit, can you hook that up or whatever it does?\u201d I asked, spinning around in a futile manner trying to see my own back. I stopped when she jerked the back of the gown closed, swiftly tying up a bunch of little cloth tapes, and connecting a series of hooks and eyes. \u201cAnd just for the record, Miss Casting the First Stone, I was talking about the mouse that was in my room that kept me awake a long time this morning when I was trying to take a nap. I\u2019m not used to sharing my room with rodents, and I was worried it would walk on me or bite me or nest in my hair or something while I was asleep. Thus, I\u2019ve been operating on very little sleep these last few days, and also thus, I fell asleep after Nikola and I\u2014\u201d I stopped, eyeing her as she snatched up a pair of shoes and shoved them at me.</p><p>\u201cEngaged in copulation with the baron!\u201d she said, giving me a scathing look. \u201cIt is all over the castle that he has taken you to his bed. The Lord shall smite you for your wicked ways, and if He does not, then we, the decent people of Andras Castle, shall see to it that you do not pervert us all with such immorality!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for the love of\u2014what did Imogen say she wanted me for?\u201d I sat on the edge of Nikola\u2019s bed\u2014which still smelled like him, and made me want to burrow back into its warmth and remember the wonderful experience of a few hours previous\u2014and strapped the shoes onto my bare feet. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be the middle of the night. Can\u2019t it wait?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is ill, and cannot rise from her bed. She made me swear I would bring you to her, for nothing would dissuade her from the idea that she must have talks with you. I do as she bids, but I will protect her! I will be at her side when you are there, so that you may not turn her into a devil\u2019s bed partner, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got sex on the mind,\u201d I told her, getting to my feet. \u201cYou seriously need to see a shrink. And if you poke at me one more time with that, I\u2019m going to talk to my partner the devil about you!\u201d</p><p>She gasped, clutching a large enamel crucifix to her massive bosom, her eyes filled with horror. Even her giant curls seemed to shrink back in horror. \u201cYou would not! The devil will steal my soul and turn me into a Krampus!\u201d</p> <p>I had a vague memory of Gretl telling me about a mythical being called a Krampus, but connected it to Christmas. What on earth did that have to do with being the devil\u2019s love bunny? \u201cWhatever. Let\u2019s just tone down all the accusations and maybe we\u2019ll get through this without anyone being Krampused, OK?\u201d</p><p>She sucked in her breath again, but confined herself to muttering in German as I tottered down the hall toward Imogen\u2019s room. I didn\u2019t like the sound of Imogen being sick, which was pretty much the only reason I had let her crabby companion drag me out of bed.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d I asked a few minutes later when I sat on the edge of Imogen\u2019s bed and studied her face. She looked pale and fairly clammy, with two bright spots on her cheekbones. \u201cYour nanny, or whatever she is, says you\u2019ve been sick, but that you wanted to see me. Can I do anything to make you feel better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have been poisoned,\u201d Imogen said weakly, but the hand that clutched my arm had a grip that made me yelp. \u201cMy uncles put something in my wine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey what?\u201d</p><p>Her eyelids fluttered at my shriek of horror before she nodded. \u201cThey know I have a weakness for a fine wine...but that is not important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019d say being poisoned is pretty damned important! Oh my god, Imogen! What can I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlasphemer!\u201d gasped Anna. \u201cProfaner!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGet a doctor, you deranged woman!\u201d I ordered, taking Imogen\u2019s hand in mine and trying to remember what one did for poisoning. \u201cIs it drink lots of milk, or eat bread? Or maybe barf...man, I knew I should have signed up for that first aid course at work, but I never got around to it. Hang in there, Imogen! You\u2019ll be OK.\u201d</p><p>A little smile touched her lips. \u201cI will not die, if that is what you are concerned about. My kind does not do so easily, and never from poison. It makes us ill for a little while only, and Anna has already purged the wine from me, so I will feel more the thing soon. I am just a bit weak, too weak to go after Papa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go find him for you if you want to tell him what his brothers did. I bet he\u2019ll open a serious can of whoop-ass on them, and after hearing about this, I wouldn\u2019t mind helping him. Are you sure you\u2019re OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, just weak. You must save Papa, Io. You are the only one who can stop them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop...\u201d Enlightenment dawned as she clutched my hand. I glanced at Anna, not knowing if I should speak in front of her. \u201cI thought we had that out earlier, when I explained about how certain things weren\u2019t supposed to happen for another two years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that is what you said, but somehow, it has changed to now. Perhaps you misunderstood what I said in...in the other time.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. You said you were twenty-two at the time, and your dad said earlier today that you were only twenty\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Imogen struggled to sit up, sweat breaking out on her forehead as she took me by the arms and shook me. \u201cI am twenty-two! Papa is forever forgetting my age, but I am twenty-two now, Io! It is today that he is meant to die!\u201d</p><p>Goose bumps crawled up my arms, making me shiver. \u201cGood god. Then his brothers\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is out with them right now!\u201d</p><p>I got to my feet, unsure of what to do, but feeling a desperate need to do something. \u201cAre you sure? Maybe Nikola is in his study playing with his robot. Did you check there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is gone to meet my uncles,\u201d she wailed, falling back on the pillows. \u201cI know because Robert told Anna, and she came to tell me that you were seen going into Papa\u2019s room, and that you should be stoned because of your loose ways, and that if we waited until midnight, Papa would be off meeting my uncles and we could capture you, and stone you.\u201d</p><p>I stared at her in horror before turning my gaze to the woman in question. She bared her teeth at me. \u201cYou are so over the line, babe. And we\u2019re going to have a little talk about that later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will stop up my ears to your unholy words! The devil will not have his way with me!\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and leaned down to Imogen to say, \u201cYou need to seriously consider getting someone else as your nanny before this one goes completely bonkers. I mean, sheesh, Imogen\u2014wanting to stone people because they sleep with someone isn\u2019t right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can talk about this later. You must go save Papa!\u201d</p><p>I straightened up and took the woolen shawl she pushed at me, turning to the crazy lady. \u201cWhere exactly did Robert say Nikola was going?\u201d</p><p>Her lips tightened as if she didn\u2019t wish to speak, but after a sharp word from Imogen, she finally said, \u201cThe Zauberwald.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the heck is a Zauberwhoosits?\u201d Nikola? You out there in brain radio land?</p><p>Silence was the answer to my tentative question. I wasn\u2019t sure if we could do the brain talking thing if we were far apart, but I felt obligated to give it a try.</p><p>\u201cIt is the name given to a small curve of wooded area slightly more than two miles from here. It is said to be a magical place, one where enchantment is heavy in the air.\u201d She shifted slightly, pressing my fingers in a painful grip. \u201cIo, you must go there immediately and stop my uncles. Do not let them destroy my papa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014I don\u2019t know how to stop guys intent on murder,\u201d I stammered. \u201cI\u2019m not good with martial arts or anything. I suppose I could throw a rock at them, but I\u2019m just pretty much useless about that sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what you do.\u201d She jerked me forward until my face was a few inches from hers, her eyes, a darker blue than Nikola\u2019s, filled with a fervent light. \u201cI don\u2019t care how you save him, but save him you must. Swear to me you will do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if I knew how\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSwear!\u201d</p><p>I swallowed back all my protests, all my doubts, all my concern for what sort of effect I might have on the future. All those protestations would be useless\u2014the second I gave in to the desire that had been building ever since I met Nikola, I signed away any ability to act in a dispassionate manner. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll save him,\u201d I promised. \u201cI don\u2019t know how, but I\u2019ll do it.\u201d Nikola? Can you hear me at all? If you can, don\u2019t go with your brothers. They\u2019re going to try to kill you.</p><p>She collapsed back on the pillows again, her skin deathly pale. Instantly, Anna was there, shoving me out of the way to tsk over Imogen, and offer her a sip of some pale-colored beverage.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d Imogen said, her voice barely above a whisper. \u201cAnd may God go with you.\u201d</p> <p>Nikola?</p><p>Silence remained the only answer, so I gave up trying to contact him, and instead tried to concoct some scheme whereby I could save Nikola, and not leave the future at risk. I left Imogen\u2019s room, wondering just how I was going to pull off such a thing. Ahead of me, Elizabet was approaching with a branch of candelabra in her hand.</p><p>\u201cJust the person I need,\u201d I told her, snatching the candles and setting them on the nearest table. \u201cWhere\u2019s the stable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOutside,\u201d she answered, giving me a quizzical look.</p><p>I gave her a shove toward the stairs. \u201cShow me!\u201d</p> <p>She looked over her shoulder at me. \u201cBut I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, sister! We don\u2019t have time to stand around arguing, not while Nikola is in danger.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened as she hurried toward the stairs. \u201cThe baron is in danger? How so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story. Come on, show me where the stable is, so I can go find him and help him beat the crap out of his brothers.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ll give her this\u2014she didn\u2019t stand around arguing; she simply bolted like a deer, racing down the stairs to the ground floor, a few tendrils of red hair coming loose from her elaborate, curly hairdo that all the women seemed to wear...those who weren\u2019t wearing more elaborate wigs, that is. Imogen\u2019s maid had tried\u2014and failed\u2014to duplicate something similar on my own head. I had finally convinced her to simply tuck my shoulder-length hair up in a modest French twist, but even that looked out of place among all the big, poufy hair worn by the servants.</p><p>\u201cDo you know where this Zauberwald place is?\u201d I asked, panting as we ran down a side corridor.</p> <p>\u201cNo, but I have only been here for three years. Old Ted might know\u2014he\u2019s been with the baron for many years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOld Ted\u2014that\u2019s the guy who takes care of the horses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d She flung open a door, and dashed inside. I followed, avoiding the inky shapes of furniture as best I could. I ran into something hard, a chair I think, and swore under my breath as I half ran, half hopped, rubbing my shin. Elizabet threw open a pair of French doors and ran outside, turning to the right and heading out into the neat, orderly hedges I had seen from an upper window.</p><p>\u201cWait, I\u2019ve got a stitch in my side and a possibly broken shinbone. Ow. Ow, ow, ow.\u201d I hobbled after her, telling myself the pain was of minor importance when it came to Nikola.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how she could see in the dark as well as she could\u2014even with the moonlight, it was still awfully black out\u2014but in next to no time we were at the stables, me completely out of breath, and Elizabet barely winded.</p><p>\u201cI...have...got to...get to the gym...again...\u201d I gasped, doubled over as Elizabet called for Ted.</p><p>\u201cAye, then, I\u2019m here, lass, what is it you be needin\u2019?\u201d An old man appeared at the stable door, his back twisted, but a cheerful look on his face. His gaze moved from Elizabet over to me, his eyes widening in surprise. \u201cOy! It\u2019s the trollop! What you be doin\u2019 with a woman the likes of her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am really getting tired of being referred to as a slut,\u201d I said, trying to stand up straight and give the man a look that should tell him a thing or two, but I was still out of breath, and my side and shin hurt something fierce. \u201cI need a horse. One with a regular saddle.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHis lordship didn\u2019t say nothing about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNikola is in danger, grave danger, and the longer you stand there and argue with me, the more likely it is he\u2019ll be dead by the time I find him, so please, for the love of all that is holy, get me a horse!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe master is in danger?\u201d the old man asked, his eyes narrowing.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I threw my hands up in a gesture of disgust. \u201cHorse! Now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe master went out riding not half an hour ago,\u201d Ted said cannily. \u201cHow be he in danger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is like a freaking nightmare! Listen to me, you obstinate old codger!\u201d I grabbed his lapels and shook him, infirmity or no infirmity. \u201cNikola is going to be killed if you don\u2019t get me a horse, and show me where the Zauberforest is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZauberwald,\u201d Elizabet corrected.</p><p>He eyed me for a few seconds, and I was just about to shove him aside and go find a horse for myself when he nodded his head, pushing me off him before hobbling back into the stable. \u201cI\u2019ll have to tell you where to find the Zauberwald, since I can\u2019t ride anymore, and my boy is off seeing his girl.\u201d</p><p>My shoulders slumped a little in relief at his words, although that relief soon turned to impatience as he saddled up the familiar Thor. I was relieved to see that he put a regular saddle on the horse, and tried to ignore the fact that the last time I tried to ride away from the castle, I ended up on the ground far more times than I liked.</p><p>\u201cHalfway down the mountain, small trail leading off the left when the road doubles back for the third time, take the fork to the left after that, clearing is past a bunch of trees,\u201d I repeated some minutes later as I got settled in the saddle, my dress hiked up around my knees. \u201cGotcha. Now let\u2019s just hope I\u2019m not too late.\u201d</p><p>That was the refrain that repeated through my head like a chant: I hope I\u2019m not too late, I hope I\u2019m not too late....</p><p>I don\u2019t know whether Thor the horse was used to my method of riding, or the proper saddle kept me upright and in place on his back, but whatever the reason, I was pathetically grateful that I didn\u2019t fall as I urged Thor into a canter. We headed down the road in a flurry of dust, the wind whistling past us while I chanted under my breath. Luckily, there was enough light to see by, and Thor seemed tolerably familiar with the road, so it wasn\u2019t long before I saw the third bend ahead, and the faintest marks in the shadows of trees where Ted had indicated a game trail led to the heart of the Zauberwald.</p><p>I turned off the road and onto the path, ducking low over Thor\u2019s neck as we entered the stand of trees, my heart racing, and my breath seeming to catch in my throat.</p><p>Instantly, the blackness closed around us, and I was left trying to guide the horse by the glimpses I had of the waning moon. The trees here weren\u2019t tightly grown together, but their fir branches obscured the sky enough to leave it slow going. The scent of pine filled the night air, Thor\u2019s hoofbeats now deadened by the dense carpet of dropped needles. Only a dull thud was audible, and that was mostly drowned out by the sound of the wind in the trees, occasional calls of animals and birds, and once or twice, I thought I heard snatches of conversation.</p><p>I sent up a little prayer that I wasn\u2019t too late, and directed Thor to what I imagined was the center of the wood.</p><p>Luckily for me, he had more sense than I did, for after about five minutes of my praying, muttering to myself, and desperately trying to listen for sounds of two men killing their vampire brother, Thor suddenly tossed his head, gave a soft, snorting whinny, and turned sharply to the left.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell, horse?\u201d I whispered, and tried to steer him back on the path that I thought I could still make out.</p><p>Thor was adamant, though, and after two more minutes of me trying to get him to go in the right direction, he stopped and dropped his head as if he was going to graze.</p><p>\u201cFine, I\u2019ll do this without you,\u201d I snarled under my breath, and slid my way out of the saddle.</p><p>I took one step and stumbled over something large and warm. I knew it was warm because I fell on it, recoiling instinctively until a familiar scent hit my nose.</p><p>\u201cNikola?\u201d I whispered, patting the shape until I recognized it for one of his legs. Fear froze me for a second, until I realized that if he was still warm, he couldn\u2019t be dead.</p><p>I quelled the horrible part of my mind that pointed out he could be freshly dead, and I could be, at that moment, lying across a dead man.</p><p>Instead, I patted my way up his body until I reached his chest, which I was intensely relieved to feel rising and falling under my questing hands. \u201cThank god I\u2019m not too late. Are you poisoned, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it, not one bit, I don\u2019t,\u201d a male voice said fairly close by, accompanied by the sound of a large body brushing tree branches aside. \u201cThe master, he\u2019s been good to me da and me, and I don\u2019t see no reason to play a trick like this on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that is why we approached you to help us, Ted. It is of the baron that we are thinking,\u201d a gruff German voice answered. \u201cHe is our brother! Do you think we would want harm to come to him? Imogen told us that this woman who has taken up residence has bewitched his mind. You must help us save him from her.\u201d</p><p>Imogen said that? I was stung by her betrayal. I thought we\u2019d bonded! But what a fool I had been to believe her tale. At what point had I talked myself into believing she was on my side? Just because she was concerned about her father? I shook my head at my own stupidity. She\u2019d told me more than once that she\u2019d do anything to save him...obviously, that anything included using me.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d been poisoned,\u201d I muttered to myself. Oh, I just bet she had. There was no coincidence in the fact that she\u2019d been conveniently poisoned and thus been unable to go after Nikola. She was obviously working with her uncles to...to what? That stumped me. I didn\u2019t have time to work it out, though. What I had to do was to get Nikola away from there, and fast.</p><p>\u201cThat has to be one of your odious brothers,\u201d I murmured to Nikola even as I felt for his head. There was a huge lump behind one of his ears, leaving my fingers wet and sticky with blood. \u201cGreat. No wonder you\u2019re unconscious.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou must fetch the strumpet and bring her to us,\u201d a second German voice said. \u201cSo that we might end the enchantment, and free our dear brother from her unholy plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am really getting tired of everyone in the eighteenth century believing I\u2019m some sort of satanic slut,\u201d I grumbled softly to Nikola\u2019s unconscious body, wiping my hands on his jacket before gently pulling him toward me. \u201cNikola, wake up, we have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose that would be all right,\u201d the man named Ted (assumedly the stable dude\u2019s son who was supposed to be out seeing his girlfriend) said slowly. \u201cBut I think I should ask me da about it first.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe have no time, my friend. You see how the moon is high in the sky? We must act now to take the enchantment off the baron. Quickly, you will return to the castle and fetch the whore, and return here as soon as you may. We will perform the sacrifice then, and save our brother.\u201d</p><p>Sacrifice?</p><p>I clasped Nikola\u2019s head in my hands and shook it gently. \u201cNikola! Wake up! They\u2019re going to sacrifice something, and I have a horrible feeling it\u2019s going to be me. Oh, for heaven\u2019s sake, now what do I do?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t have time to come up with a suitably MacGyver-esque plan; it was obvious that as soon as Nikola\u2019s evil brothers got rid of the groom\u2019s son, they would come back to check on Nikola, which meant I had to get him out of there pronto.</p><p>\u201cOK, let\u2019s get you onto the horse, and maybe I can hide you in the forest until you come to.\u201d Thor, who was busily snuffling Nikola\u2019s feet, looked on with interest as I half dragged, half carried Nikola the few steps to his side. Unfortunately, there\u2019s a big difference between dragging a full-grown, solidly built man a few feet and lifting him up onto the back of a horse, and it quickly became apparent that I\u2019d have to find another way to move him.</p> <p>Sounds of voices speaking in German, growing louder along with the snapping of branches, spurred me into instant action.</p><p>\u201cSorry about this, but it\u2019s the only option,\u201d I whispered to Nikola as I wrestled his coat off his torso, and wrapped it around his head, tying the sleeves around it to provide a buffering cocoon. I ripped off his neckcloth, a thick swath of linen about eight inches wide and a yard long, and tied it around one of his ankles, tying the other end to the stirrup. With another murmured apology, I grabbed Thor\u2019s bridle and turned him so Nikola lay behind him. Light flashed in the trees, the golden light of a lantern as it shone through the branches.</p><p>I flinched as I hauled the resisting horse forward, aware that the thumping sounds of the first couple of hesitant steps forward were made by Nikola\u2019s body being dragged across lumps of sod, wood, and rocks, but after the horse shied in protest of the awkward burden he hauled, he walked forward docilely enough.</p><p>We\u2019d just made it past a couple of fir trees that seemed to have twined around each other as they grew when there was an angry shout behind us.</p><p>\u201cCrap!\u201d I swore, and, grabbing the bridle firmly, bolted forward, praying that I had wrapped Nikola\u2019s head well enough to keep it from being damaged any further.</p><p>The yelling was now accompanied by the sound of men running after us. I dodged around another big fir, trying frantically to think of a way to lose them. I couldn\u2019t drag Nikola much farther without risking harming him, and, without help, couldn\u2019t get him onto the horse. As I rounded the tree, moonlight spilled onto the ground in front of me. My heart leaped at the sight of the faintly visible swirling mass of light that seemed to hang in the air in the center of the clearing. \u201cMy swirly thing!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou! Trollop! Stop!\u201d</p><p>I glanced over my shoulder to see the thinner of Nikola\u2019s brothers dashing around trees, a sword in his hand. He was about thirty feet behind us, and I could see, even in the flickering shadow of the trees, the man\u2019s lips pulled back to reveal a horrible grimace of sheer evil.</p><p>I ran for the swirly thing, stopping just at the edge of it, and threw myself down at Nikola\u2019s feet, desperately trying to wrench free the cloth I\u2019d tied around his ankle. The weight of his body had tightened the knot, however, making it impossible for me to undo.</p><p>\u201cI hope to god our lizard overlords understand why I had to do this,\u201d I told Nikola as I leaped back to my feet and, grabbing the horse by his bridle, ran straight into the middle of the swirling light.</p><p>July 15</p><p>The noise was what woke me up. It was a horrible, strangled sort of noise, one that suddenly became very loud and annoying, and disrupted my happy little sleep.</p><p>I frowned when the noise increased to a volume that irritated my nerves, frowning even more when the lovely warmth that surrounded me suddenly darkened. I opened one eye and looked up into the disheveled face of a man.</p><p>A very handsome man with black hair, and the most gorgeous eyes the color of a pale blue topaz.</p> <p>A man who looked familiar.</p><p>\u201cI bloody well should look familiar, since you were riding me just a few hours ago. Why the devil did you try to asphyxiate me with my own coat? Is it because I insisted that you be the one to seduce me? Or was that your way of starting some very curious form of lovemaking? If it is the latter, I must inform you that I will not have it. I am a fair man, a generous man, a man who is willing to let his woman seduce him if that is her desire, but I do not find having my vision and breathing obstructed in any manner titillating. Henceforth, you will leave off the rough lovemaking, and return to the sort where you apply your naked flesh to mine in a more congenial manner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNikola?\u201d I asked, as slowly the shadowed recesses of my brain brightened with dawning enlightenment. I opened the other eye and for a few seconds wondered what the hell had happened. I went ahead and asked him. \u201cWhy do you look like you\u2019ve been dragged through a hedge backward? Why is your face all red?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you bind my head and tie me to Thor?\u201d he countered.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d I sat up, and immediately the world spun around me. Nikola grabbed my arms and held me for the few seconds it took for everything to resume its proper place. \u201cOh, man, what was I drinking last night? I have the hangover to end all hangovers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have not been hung, although I believe I would be within my rights to throttle you. Are you well?\u201d</p><p>This last was said with much more concern than the former, and after a minute of letting my brain get back to the business of running my body, I nodded. \u201cJust a bit woozy, although I don\u2019t quite understand what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis,\u201d he said, gesturing toward his boot. The remnants of a piece of white cloth fluttered from his ankle. \u201cAnd that.\u201d</p><p>I looked at where he pointed, and saw a big horse happily grazing a few yards from us, another white cloth dangling from one stirrup.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s...that\u2019s...\u201d I closed my eyes for a moment to try to remember the horse\u2019s name.</p><p>\u201cThor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThor! That\u2019s right. Oh, holy Jesus!\u201d With the mention of the name, the full memory of the terrifying flight through the woods returned to me. I got to my knees, holding on to Nikola\u2019s arm as I quickly looked around us, half expecting to see one of his horrible brothers lurking in the shadows of the trees.</p><p>Although we were in the shade of the trees, the sun was high in the sky, casting its rays down on earth and human and horse alike...and the swirly thing that crested the slight hill about twenty feet away. \u201cThe swirly thing is still there, although\u201d\u2014I bit my lower lip as I got to my feet\u2014\u201cit looks different. It looks dimmer, if that makes sense.\u201d</p><p>Nikola nodded, winced at the gesture, and put his hand to the back of his head before saying, \u201cIt would look different, given its use. I take it that is the object you mentioned seeing before you were transported to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and what do you mean\u2014oh, your head! How does it feel?\u201d Gently, I touched his head, finding a small bump where a larger one had been earlier.</p><p>\u201cSore. Someone hit me on the back of it. Yes, that\u2019s the spot. It\u2019s healing now, but when I woke up, I felt as if Alexander had marched his entire army over it.\u201d</p><p>My hands dropped, and my gaze skittered away for a few seconds while I fought the guilty thought that I\u2019d made it worse. I cleared my throat. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure it was one of your brothers who knocked you out. Um. How does the rest of you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bit battered, but improving with every passing minute. I appear to have some ability that allows me to heal at an accelerated rate. I made a few notes about that before you woke up.\u201d He shook out his jacket, and put it on before pulling a small knife from his boot to cut the cloth from first his ankle and then the stirrup. \u201cWhy did you tie me to a horse and drag me here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s going to take some explaining. The super-short version is that once I saw the swirly thing, I knew I\u2019d have to risk it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRisk what?\u201d he asked, frowning as he bent to put away the knife.</p><p>\u201cBring you through it to my time.\u201d</p><p>He stood up and gave me a long look. \u201cYou did what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelcome to 2012,\u201d I said with a smile, spreading my hands. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may well like it, but that\u2019s not something we\u2019re bound to find out. We did not travel through time, Io. You simply stumbled over a root or rock and became insensible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think we came through the swirly thing?\u201d I looked around the clearing, but there was nothing there to offer a clue as to the year. \u201cWhy not? You know I came through it to your time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is impossible because that\u201d\u2014he gestured toward the object in question\u2014\u201cis clearly a portal, and you said yourself it has diminished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it does look a lot fainter, but I don\u2019t see what that has to do with anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou drew upon its energy to arrive here. It faded in response. There is not enough energy left in it to transport two people and a horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr it sent us back, and what you see is what it looks like after it did so.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He frowned at that line of reasoning, and was about to argue when I stopped him with a question of my own. \u201cHow did you know it was a portal? Did you know this was here all along? I told you that I came through a swirly light thing\u2014why didn\u2019t you tell me this is where it was located?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not know this was the object that you used to reach me,\u201d he said, giving a little head shake that had a swift flash of pain crossing his face. \u201cI have never seen this phenomenon before, but I know it is a portal because that is the exact location that a demon lord named Magoth used when he laid the curse upon me. He appeared out of nothing; thus, he must have used some sort of a portal from a different place to this one. It is only logical to assume that what one man might do, so might another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA demon cursed you?\u201d I asked, my skin crawling at the thought.</p> <p>\u201cA demon lord,\u201d he said with emphasis. \u201cHe told me that he was commissioned to destroy me, but that the method was not specified, so he chose the most heinous punishment he could think of, and cursed me to be a Dark One.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly freak-out,\u201d I said, unable to imagine how horrible that had been.</p><p>\u201cHe also took my soul, but I have learned to cope without that,\u201d Nikola added in an offhand manner, just as if the loss of a soul were a minor inconvenience.</p><p>\u201cYou have got to be kidding.... No, you\u2019re not, are you? You don\u2019t have a soul?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He took a look around us, then, putting both hands on my waist, hoisted me up and onto the saddle. \u201cI thought you would have noticed.\u201d</p> <p>I was a bit taken aback by that statement. \u201cWell, shoot, Nikola, it\u2019s not like I go around checking everyone I meet to see if a devil has taken their soul. But...is that why you\u2019re all angsty inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngsty?\u201d He patted his coat and pulled out a familiar notebook. \u201cI do not know the meaning of this word, but assuming you are referring to the emptiness that fills me, then yes, that is due to the loss of my soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wondered about that.\u201d I grabbed the horse\u2019s mane when Nikola took hold of Thor\u2019s bridle and turned him, walking back toward the way I\u2019d come through the trees. \u201cI thought maybe it was something I was imagining. What exactly is a demon lord? And why did someone hire him to curse you?\u201d</p><p>He was silent for a minute, finding a path for us through the trees, keeping to the shade and holding branches back for me whenever possible. For some reason that, and the knowledge that he really and truly was cursed into being a vampire, tugged at my heartstrings.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been able to find out who damned me to this curse, although I have my suspicions. A demon lord is one of the princes of Abaddon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHell. At least, that\u2019s what I assume, since no one has ever told me differently. When I was cursed, I did some research into the phenomenon of Dark Ones,\u201d he said very matter-of-factly.</p><p>I bit back a giggle. Of course he researched the subject\u2014I didn\u2019t expect anything different from Mr. Scientific Reason.</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t much documented about them, but what I did find reassured me that although Dark Ones are not commonly found, there are others, many of whom are from my native Moravia. I wrote to the society to inform them that I was newly made a member of their group, and received in return an offer of assistance should I have any questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVampires have their own society?\u201d I asked, a bit flabbergasted at that. \u201cDo they have local chapters? A newsletter? A Facebook page?\u201d</p><p>He stopped, glared at me, and pulled out his notebook again.</p><p>I giggled.</p><p>\u201cYes, there is a society for Dark Ones,\u201d he said after tucking away the notebook, and taking Thor\u2019s bridle again. He marched on through the trees. \u201cThey did not send me any other letters containing news or otherwise. Years later, after Benedikt was born, I thought of contacting them to discuss his weaning, but my wife discovered that if she gave him a piece of raw meat, he would gain sustenance from that. As he grew older, he commenced to taking blood from living animals, and later to people. It was a most interesting experience, and one I documented fully. Someday, I shall publish my findings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet that would make fascinating reading.\u201d</p> <p>He glanced over his shoulder to me, suspicion evident in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI mean it. I never really thought about what baby vampires eat. I guess I thought they just, you know, ate off their moms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey do. They nurse until they are weaned and then they consume blood. At least, that is what Benedikt did. Imogen was different, but I attribute that to the fact that she very much resembles her mother, whereas Benedikt favors me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really interesting. Do you ever eat stuff that isn\u2019t blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now.\u201d He frowned, and pushed back the low-hanging branch of a giant fir tree. \u201cI tried to at first, but it made me violently ill. I decided that something was not agreeing with me, and systematically began to eliminate those items of food that I could not stomach. After two years, I realized that it was food itself that my body had difficulty with. It would seem that Dark Ones do not digest food the same way as others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh. That\u2019s really weird. So you just went on a blood diet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did Elizabet say that you liked maggoty pheasant?\u201d</p><p>He sighed, and avoided a pool of sunlight, skirting it as we continued through the trees. \u201cThe servants would have commented if they saw that I did not take any nourishment, so I developed a method of pretending to consume food. Mostly, I had meals in my study. When that was unavoidable, I made sure one of my dogs was in the room with me, and simply slipped the food off my plate to whatever beast was handy. It saved me from attracting attention I prefer to do without, kept the dogs well fed, and made my cook happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one smart cookie, you know that?\u201d I asked, a warm glow of happiness spreading through me as I watched the back of his head.</p><p>\u201cCookie. Hmm. Cookie. A sweet biscuit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup, you got that one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a question for you, if it is my turn to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot. Er...that means go ahead.\u201d</p><p>He stopped in the middle of reaching for his notebook, and asked instead, \u201cI have had the short explanation\u2014if you can call it that\u2014of what actions you took, and now I would like a more detailed version. Why did you tie me to Thor and wrap my head in my coat?\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cI had a feeling you weren\u2019t going to let me get away without explaining fully. The truth is that your brothers\u2014how do I say this so it doesn\u2019t sound really circumstantial?\u2014your brothers were planning on killing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am immortal,\u201d he said after a few seconds of digesting that thought. I found it interesting\u2014and telling\u2014that he didn\u2019t at all question the idea of his brothers wanting to do him in.</p><p>\u201cBut you can be killed. You said so yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I can, but it is not an easy task to accomplish.\u201d He was silent again for another minute. \u201cHow do you know that they have planned to see that harm befalls me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cImogen told me.\u201d</p><p>He shot me a startled look, but kept walking.</p><p>\u201cThe Imogen in my time, that is. She was very upset, if that makes it better. Extremely so. She refused to even come up to this forest to take pictures because she said it has so many bad memories for her. Oh, holy cow, Imogen! We just left her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will be home shortly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we won\u2019t. Nikola, whether or not you want to admit it, I dragged you through that wormhole or portal or whatever the hell it is, smack-dab into the twenty-first century. It\u2019s 2012 now, and although Imogen is still alive\u2014at least I hope she is...oh, man, if the fact that I saved you messed things up, I\u2019m going to be so pissed\u2014anyway, assuming the lizards haven\u2019t taken over and she\u2019s here, then she\u2019s just fine and dandy. And she did tell me to do whatever it took to save you. She was really insistent about that, so I guess I really shouldn\u2019t worry, although now I feel terribly guilty over leaving her alone in the eighteenth century. That worry is retracted, however, if it turns out she was in with your brothers. Which I don\u2019t think she would be, because honestly, what would she gain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy daughter would never betray me in such a fashion,\u201d Nikola said stiffly. \u201cI make no such claim about my brothers; they have long resented the fact that my mother left her fortune to them in a trust that I administer, and I can readily believe that they would wish to see me gone so they can take over the control of their fortunes. However, to suggest that the same might be applied to my daughter is unreasonable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Although they did tell that kid named Ted that Imogen was in on the whole thing, but I can see where that might be a red herring.\u201d</p><p>He sighed and pulled out his notebook.</p><p>\u201cAgain, though, I don\u2019t see what she\u2019d benefit from it. If you were to die, your son would get the castle, wouldn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s out, unless Imogen plans to knock him off, too. \u2018Knock him off\u2019 means murder, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, I gathered the meaning of the phrase from the context,\u201d he murmured politely.</p><p>\u201cI just hope she\u2019ll be OK with no one to look after her but that crazy woman who sees smut everywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImogen is a woman grown, and capable of taking care of herself in all matters but that of men, and I have placed my trust in Frau Leiven to guard against Imogen being allowed undesired contact with such individuals. My word, as you have no doubt seen for yourself, is absolute. Frau Leiven will guard her from danger on that source.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t miss the emphasis.</p><p>\u201cI swear to god, if you call me a trollop or strumpet or whore, I\u2019ll deck you,\u201d I growled, waving one fist at him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t even look at me. \u201cAs for your other statement, I see that I shall have to show to you that based on the state of that portal, what you suggest is just not possible. I don\u2019t suppose you would care to make a wager on the subject?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat subject?\u201d I asked, confused.</p><p>\u201cWhether or not it would be possible to take two people and a horse through the portal at the center of the Zauberwald.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose. What did you have in mind to wager? I wouldn\u2019t have minded one of those da Vinci drawings, but I suppose those are long gone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhoever wins the wager will seduce the other person.\u201d</p><p>I burst into laughter, but a quick glance at his face made it absolutely clear that he was quite serious. \u201cRight, so if I lose the bet, you get to seduce me, and if I win the bet, I\u2019m the one doing the seducing? I may be a bit thick in the head what with all those falls I took yesterday, but I don\u2019t see any motivation in this wager for ensuring a win. I mean, we both benefit whether we win or lose.\u201d</p><p>He flashed a roguish, very wolflike smile back at me, and was about to reply when we suddenly stopped. Sunlight shone ahead, signaling the end of the forested area. Nikola had been forced to make a circuitous path through the trees to stay in the shade, and when we reached the ragged edge of the tree line, he paused, looking out at the road.</p><p>It was paved.</p><p>I cracked my knuckles, and smiled as I drawled, \u201cExcellent. I believe I shall introduce some fun things into the next seduction. Have you ever heard of massage oil that heats when you blow on it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d he asked, pointing toward the road. \u201cIt looks too smooth to be cobblestones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called blacktop, or asphalt. It does have stones in it, actually, just all ground up and blended with some other things, and then heated up to a really high temperature, which makes it viscous. It\u2019s poured on roads while it\u2019s hot, and then kind of smoothed out, so cars can drive on it.\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath as he pulled out his notebook. \u201cI cannot believe I miscalculated so greatly with regards to that portal. It looked depleted. I\u2019m going to need a second journal if this keeps up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s bound to be a learning curve, but that\u2019s to be expected. After all, I had to have someone explain to me how to use the closet stool thing that\u2019s really a camping toilet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClosestool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, my point is that it\u2019s your turn to not know how everything works, but don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be happy to explain stuff as we come upon it. Let\u2019s go down to town, and I\u2019ll find a phone and call my cousin to pick us up.\u201d</p> <p>He took a deep breath, his fingers twitching a little.</p><p>I smiled. \u201cHow much of that sentence did you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything to the point where you mentioned a phone.\u201d</p><p>I leaned down and patted his arm. \u201cIt\u2019ll make sense in a while. Town\u2019s that way, to the left.\u201d</p><p>He gave the road a considering look, then turned the horse to the right, staying in the shadow of the trees as he led Thor uphill, rather than down. \u201cNo. I refuse to accept that the portal was anything but depleted. Therefore, we will go home, and then I will show you that despite the miracle of the smooth cobblestoned road, we have not done the impossible and used a spent portal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour castle isn\u2019t there any longer, Nikola. I\u2019m sorry, I know it\u2019s going to be upsetting to realize that neither of your kids maintained it after you were killed, but I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s the truth. The castle is a ruin now, some of it having been destroyed in a war during the nineteen hundreds, according to what my cousin told me, and the rest of it falling into decay afterward.\u201d</p><p>Nikola said nothing, just set his jaw, and grimly led Thor and me up the winding road. Hidden as we were by the stand of forest that covered the slopes of the mountain, it wasn\u2019t until we came to the end of the tree line that Nikola stopped and stared, his head tilted back.</p><p>The ruins of a castle were clearly visible atop the mountainside.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said again, sliding off the horse to put my hand on Nikola\u2019s arm. His face wore a stricken look, as if some vital part of his being had been severed. \u201cI\u2019m really, really sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the fact that my home is destroyed,\u201d he asked, his eyes still on the remains of the castle, \u201cor for the disillusionment I feel in realizing that I don\u2019t after all know how the world functions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor your castle,\u201d I said, giving in to the urge that had been tormenting me. I wrapped my arms around him and hugged him. His scent teased me until I buried my face in his neck, breathing deeply, and fighting the almost desperate need I had to bite him.</p><p>It still shocked me, this sudden urge to bite him, but since it didn\u2019t seem to discombobulate Nikola, I was willing to cope with it without becoming obnoxiously paranoid that I was going to turn into a vampire, too.</p><p>His arms came around me, pulling me tight against his body. My inner bits gave a cheer of happiness.</p><p>I told you that Dark Ones do not work that way.</p><p>\u201cI know, but how else do you explain the fact that I want to bite you? I\u2019ve never bitten any other sexual partner. It\u2019s totally unlike me. And don\u2019t tell me that I also said I don\u2019t sleep with guys I haven\u2019t known for a long time, because I\u2019m well aware that I\u2019ve totally gone out of character on that front, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to say anything about that.\u201d He donned a noble expression.</p><p>I shook my finger at the expression, and bit his chin. \u201cMaybe not, but you were thinking it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d His hands slid down from my waist to my behind. What you feel is not your desire to bite me, but my need to feed on you, sweetling.</p><p>I giggled at the endearment, and wriggled against him. A bit peckish, are you?</p><p>I begin to suspect that I shall always be so around you. Cease squirming in that distracting manner; I am attempting to conduct a thorough scientific study of the area.</p><p>You are? I pushed back from where I had, in fact, been brazenly rubbing myself on him. \u201cHow are you doing that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am examining my surroundings in a comprehensive manner.\u201d</p><p>I watched him for a minute or two. He stood with one arm still around me, his eyes slowly scanning across the area in front of us.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just looking,\u201d I said, a bit confused (it was becoming an all too familiar state).</p><p>\u201cYes. It is the scientific way. I shall be happy to explain it to you at a later time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s hardly a thorough scientific study. I mean, if you wanted to do that, you should make a grid of the area, and then examine each square of the grid for clues or evidence or whatever it is you do when you want to know every little thing about that spot. You\u2019ll probably need those little number cards to mark stuff of interest, and of course latex gloves and those bootie things that keep you from leaving footprints. I wonder if it would be possible to get an infrared camera? I\u2019ve always wanted one of those. Hmm.\u201d</p><p>He stopped scanning and frowned at me. \u201cWhat are you babbling about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA thorough scientific study.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cThose cameras are probably too expensive, and besides, I heard they\u2019re best used at night, and who in their right mind is going to try to examine the ground at night?\u201d</p><p>He started to reach for his notebook, gave me an odd look, and let his hand drop. \u201cI refuse to be a slave to your determination to make me insane with curiosity. I do not care what bootie things are, or why an infrared camera is too expensive, let alone what it is, and why you would need gloves made of latacks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLatex, and that\u2019s fine, punkin,\u201d I said, patting his arm in a supportive manner. \u201cYou have plenty of time to learn about the twenty-first century; you don\u2019t have to do it all at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I wish to learn as much as I can so that when we return home, I will have ample notes to study at leisure.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him, little goose bumps crawling up my arms. \u201cWhen we return home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Once we have explored what there is here, of course. I will not rush you, although I hesitate to leave Imogen alone for more than a few weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...uh... Nikola, we are home.\u201d</p><p>He turned to face me, a frown pulling down his brows. \u201cWe are in the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is my home, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is not, however, mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s the future! It\u2019s better than what you left!\u201d I said, frustration building inside me. \u201cThe technology alone is going to blow your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not wish for my mind to be blown,\u201d he said, his frown growing. \u201cAre you saying that you do not wish to return with me to my home?\u201d</p><p>I opened and closed my mouth a couple of times before I could finally put words into action. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not saying that, but, Nikola, we don\u2019t even know that it\u2019s possible to return back to your time. You said yourself that the portal looked like it was almost wiped out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd with time, it may strengthen. It might not, but that will be an issue we can address should that happen. Until then, I intend to explore your world, and when the portal is once again usable, return home.\u201d His gaze pinned me back. \u201cI had assumed you would return with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... I think that you need to give the present a chance before you make plans to return to the past,\u201d I said carefully.</p><p>He studied me. \u201cYou did not like my home and my time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that. I just said that I think you need to try out my time before you\u2014before we make a decision. OK?\u201d</p><p>He was silent a few minutes. \u201cVery well. You were at my home for a few days; I can do the same for you.\u201d</p><p>I bit back the comment that such a short time wasn\u2019t going to be nearly enough to show him what the present was like, knowing full well that the same could be said to me of the past. This wasn\u2019t an argument that was going to be settled quickly or easily.</p><p>I changed the subject. \u201cExactly how hungry are you? Should I give in to my biteyness so that you can fill up, or can it wait until we can find somewhere more private than the side of the road next to a haunted forest?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He sighed. \u201cThe Zauberwald is not haunted; it is simply...different.\u201d</p><p>I wrapped my arms around him, and gently bit the tendon in his neck.</p><p>\u201cYour attempt to seduce me into making love to you is not at all appropriate at this time,\u201d he said sternly a few seconds before his mouth took over mine, his tongue going all bossy in a way that had me melting against him. \u201cIt is daylight, and should I give in to your wanton and wholly inappropriate demands, I would end up with severe burns along my back and buttocks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s always the forest,\u201d I pointed out with a coyness that took me by surprise. I was never coy! \u201cAnd I could be on top in case any pesky sunlight sneaked through the branches.\u201d</p><p>He thought for a moment, his gaze flickering over to the line of trees. I could feel him considering it, weighing the desire and hunger that he kept so severely reined in with an excited curiosity about this new environment. \u201cThat would result with pine needles finding their way into parts of me that would prefer not to entertain them.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, and gave him a swift kiss before turning to where Thor was cropping the grass. I let Nikola stand in the shade while I led the horse over to him. \u201cLater it is. If you put my shawl over your head, do you think you could ride?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am an expert horseman. I can ride with or without a shawl with equal ease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart-ass. You know what I mean.\u201d</p> <p>He picked me up and heaved me into the saddle. \u201cI do, but the question is moot. Thor would not be happy with two riders.\u201d He took the bridle again, and began to lead the horse along the edge of the tree line, staying in the shade as much as possible.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he wouldn\u2019t be, but it would be faster, and it would alleviate my guilt at riding when you have to walk. Oh, man, your face is turning red. Here, let me drape the shawl over your head. That might protect you a bit.\u201d</p><p>He tried to wave the shawl away, but after a few minutes of arguing, he gave in and let me drape it over his head.</p><p>We walked along in silence for a few minutes, the only sounds audible the sharp, high calls of birds, and the occasional low drone of noise that I had no problem picking out as belonging to a car.</p><p>\u201cSo, how old were you when you were vamped?\u201d</p><p>Nikola glanced back at me, his pale blue eyes filled with curiosity. \u201cI was seven and twenty. My mother died about a year later. She was taken by typhoid fever. My brothers had it, as well, but they survived.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. That must have been really hard on you. And you had no friendly neighborhood vamp to show you the ropes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat rope?\u201d</p><p>I waved it away. \u201cIt\u2019s just an expression. What did your family think about what happened to you?\u201d</p><p>Thor\u2019s muffled hoofbeats filled in the silence for a minute. \u201cMy mother was dead, as was her second husband. My brothers were two and three years younger than me.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything more, but I sensed some strong emotion in him, an unhappy emotion, one that I wanted to explore, but with a mental oath at myself, I kept my lips (and mental microphone) quiet. Of course he felt a strong emotion; he was remembering how his world had changed at the hands of a demon lord. I wanted to ask who he believed had damned him in that way, but a swift glance at the rigid set of his shoulders and the tense line of his jaw told me my questions would not be welcome.</p><p>Instead, I spent the next forty minutes chatting about the town, and what differences he\u2019d find once we reached there. I explained about cars, and cell phones, and airplanes, and was just broaching the subject of computers when we made the last turn of the twisty road that led into town. Below us, in the smooth pastureland that was the valley floor, the GothFaire still sat in its U shape of brightly colored tents, with equally colorful travel trailers arranged in a neat formation on the far side of the fairway.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re still here?\u201d I asked aloud, my eyes on a distant figure of a man as he wandered through the fair. \u201cWell, that\u2019s a stroke of luck. Look, Nikola, the fair is still here.\u201d</p><p>He glanced over at it, his brows rising a little under the shadow cast by the shawl over his head. \u201cAh. Are there conjurers? I\u2019ve always had an interest in conjurers. When I was very young, I wished to become one, but my mother said that no baron had ever been a conjurer, and she refused to get a tutor for me so that I might learn the art. I studied it on my own, naturally, but I believe that I would have been an excellent conjurer if only I had been apprenticed accordingly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou are seriously the strangest man I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d I told him, sliding off Thor. \u201cFascinating, but strange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou also find me arousing,\u201d he said with a smug, very male expression on his handsome face. \u201cEven now you wish to wrestle me to the verge, and ride my manly parts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, it\u2019s bad enough that you know I\u2019m thinking these smutty things about you, but you don\u2019t have to tell me that you know I\u2019m thinking them!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? What do you mean, why? Isn\u2019t it obvious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it was obvious, I wouldn\u2019t have asked. I\u2019m not the sort of man who talks just to hear himself speak. I do, however, have a curiosity about such things, which I believe I\u2019ve mentioned in the past. So if I ask why, it is because I do not understand how acknowledging the fact that you spend an inordinate amount of time dwelling on the subject of riding me, not to mention reliving those moments earlier in the previous evening when you did, in fact, do just that, is repugnant to you. You wish to ride me, and I have no objection to such a desire, so we are of one mind regarding that subject. Why would you not wish to admit it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor someone who doesn\u2019t talk just to hear himself, you sure do go on and on,\u201d I said somewhat tartly. The fact that he was absolutely right was neither here nor there, but I was determined to rise above such things and move on. \u201cAnd as long as we\u2019re being strictly factual, I may want to ride you like a ten-cent pony, but I don\u2019t wish to do so on the side of the road. Come on, let\u2019s get into town so all that riding can commence. Er...not in public, but in private. In my room. Assuming Gretl doesn\u2019t have a hissy over you, which I don\u2019t think she will, but you never know. GothFaire doesn\u2019t open until nighttime, so we have plenty of time for all those things you are thinking about doing to me\u2014oh yes, don\u2019t look so innocent. I\u2019m completely aware of your determination to try some kinky position you read about in a naughty French pamphlet you have hidden behind some boring books in your study\u2014what was I saying? Oh, the GothFaire doesn\u2019t open until later, so we can visit it then, and you can see Imogen and your son and his wife.\u201d</p><p>He stopped and stared at me, his eyes wide beneath the folds of my shawl wrapped around his head. \u201cBenedikt has married? He\u2019s too young!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s over three hundred years,\u201d I reminded him.</p><p>He grumbled at that, but allowed me to take the lead and hustle him toward town.</p><p>July 15, Part 2 (there\u2019s a lot to write about)</p><p>I had to stop writing about the stuff that happened when we came back to the present day because all hell broke loose, but I don\u2019t want to ruin anything by doing that foreshadowing crap, so I won\u2019t say anything other than man alive! Just when you think everything is peachy keen.</p><p>Nikola coped with things much better than I expected, certainly much better than I had dealt with the eighteenth century. Mind you, he didn\u2019t have to undergo the hell that was finding a camping toilet all done up to look spiffy and stuff inside a house (but let\u2019s face facts\u2014it was still a camping toilet).</p><p>When we walked into town, Nikola was all big eyes and curiosity about everything\u2014cars and people and buildings\u2014but he took it all in stride and simply made copious notes about what he wanted explained.</p><p>The people in town were equally cool about the fact that we led a horse into town, but given the pastureland around it, I gathered it wasn\u2019t an unknown thing to see someone ride around the more urban areas. By the time I begged a woman who was outside gardening to use her phone, and called Gretl (and submitted to her screams of joy, and later a tirade about disappearing without a word to her), Nikola had removed the shawl I\u2019d tossed over his head to protect his face from the sun, and begun to conduct what he thought of as a scientific examination of the people of the twenty-first century.</p><p>\u201cI know, I know, I have tons of explaining to do, and I\u2019ll gladly do it, but if you could bring me some clothes and my passport and the credit cards that\u2019re tucked into my suitcase, and meet me in town at the hotel, I\u2019ll tell you what happened. Although you probably should be braced for a really weird tale,\u201d I told her after she had run out of steam. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose anyone found my purse and camera, did they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you lose them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were...well...yeah, not sure. I assume they were stolen when I went through the...um...yeah. They were probably stolen. Never mind, I just wondered if anyone found them and brought them to the police or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIo, you aren\u2019t making any sense at all. Why must I meet you at the hotel? Why will you not come home? And how were your things stolen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to come here because I\u2019ve got a friend with me, and after some thought, I decided that it wasn\u2019t fair to foist him on you, too. He\u2019s a bit...uh...different. And I\u2019ll explain how I lost my things later. Please grab some of my things and stuff them in the duffel bag for me, and I\u2019ll see you in half an hour at the hotel, OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIo, what is going\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotta run. Nikola just found a FedEx woman, and I think he\u2019s grilling her about the truck. See you in a little while!\u201d</p><p>I hung up before she could continue, hurried past the gardening woman with scattered thanks, and grabbed Nikola\u2019s arm just as the woman was about to urge him into her truck.</p><p>The hussy.</p><p>\u201cThere you are, munchkin,\u201d I said loudly, baring my teeth at the skinny blond woman. She had her hand on Nikola\u2019s arm, and was urging him to climb up into the truck in a syrupy voice that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. I grabbed Thor\u2019s reins from where they\u2019d been looped around the mailbox, and hauled him over next to Nikola, covertly shoving the horse until he sidestepped toward the woman. \u201cI told you I wouldn\u2019t be long. No, Thor! Bad horsie! You shouldn\u2019t step on people\u2019s feet; they don\u2019t like it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nikola gave me a long look.</p><p>I smiled even broader at the woman as she swore in German, holding up one foot and hopping around in pain. \u201cSorry. You done here, Nikola? Excellent. Let\u2019s go on up to the hotel and see if there\u2019s somewhere we can park Thor.\u201d</p><p>He frowned at me, then looked back at the truck. \u201cThis woman has offered to show me the inside of her carriage. It appears to be run on that engine you mentioned, and I wish to see it. If I am to explore your world, then I must understand how things function, and that includes how a\u2014\u201d He glanced at the side of the truck. \u201c\u2014how a FedEx works.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, honey,\u201d I said, taking him by the arm and gently pulling him away from the temptress. \u201cShe wants to show you much more than just how she delivers packages.\u201d</p><p>Io, I wish to see inside this carriage.</p><p>I know you do, but honestly, that woman doesn\u2019t give a hoot about you looking around at how the truck is built. She just wants to jump your bones.</p><p>He looked faintly puzzled. Why would she want to kill me and assault my bones? I have done nothing to her.</p><p>Nikola, you\u2019re what, sixty-some years old? Well, you don\u2019t look more than thirty, an extremely handsome thirty, what with your gorgeous eyes, and that black hair, and of course your face, not to mention your chest and legs and naughty parts, and that woman\u2014really, could she be any more blatant? I\u2019m standing right here with my hand on you and she\u2019s still yammering away in German. What\u2019s she saying? I bet she\u2019s whispering mechanical sweet nothings in your ear, isn\u2019t she? Anyway, she just wants to do all those things to you that I want to do, and since I don\u2019t share, she\u2019s not going to have the chance to do them in the back of her smutmobile.</p> <p>He gave me another long look as he pulled out his notebook. I understand now. You are jealous.</p><p>So not true.</p><p>The woman tried to tug Nikola toward the truck.</p><p>I saw red. \u201cLook, babe, you may do things differently here in Austria, and I\u2019m all for being a good American abroad and stuff like that, but if you do that one more time, I\u2019m going to deck you. He\u2019s not up for grabs, capisce?\u201d</p><p>The woman snarled something rude at me in German. Nikola laughed, and answered her in the same language before taking Thor\u2019s reins, and slipping his other arm around me, urging me forward toward the center of town.</p><p>\u201cAll right, Mr. Urbane, what did she say that made you laugh? And what did you say back to her that made her look so shocked?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe asked if I could get rid of my mother so that she might answer all my questions about her carriage.\u201d</p><p>I gasped. \u201cYour mother! That bitch!\u201d</p><p>He gave my waist a little squeeze. \u201cI told her that you were my woman, and that although I appreciated the fact that she wanted to bone me, only you were allowed to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh... Nikola, we\u2019re going to have to have a chat about colloquialisms in the very near future,\u201d I said, wondering how on earth I was going to explain to him the intricacies of modern slang. \u201cBut seriously, your mother? OK, I look older than you, but still. I only look a little older than you, just a smidgen older, but that\u2019s because you look so frigging young.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIf you like, I will change myself to appear older, although you do not look ancient, as you are thinking. You look...mature.\u201d</p><p>I opened my eyes really wide and looked at him. \u201cYou do not tell a woman she looks mature. That\u2019s tantamount to saying she\u2019s an old hag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh? How about ripe?\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath. \u201cLook, I may not be as buffed and toned as Miss Austrian Hussypants back there, but I am not mature, and I am not ripe. I\u2019m thirty-nine if you want to be absolutely specific, and my friends, my friends say that I look much younger. Much, much younger! OK, so forty is just two months away, but that doesn\u2019t mean squat, because everyone knows that women just get better after thirty, whereas men have already peaked and are declining. So you can stuff that up your...hey. What do you mean you will change yourself to appear older?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf it bothers you that I appear to be younger, I will modify my appearance.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him in amazement. \u201cYou mean dye your hair or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I did this for my wife, when she aged. She, too, disliked the fact that I looked much younger than her.\u201d His brows pulled together a little. \u201cI assume that is a trait particular to women, although Imogen does not yet display such leanings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you can actually change how you look?\u201d I waved a hand around in a vague gesture. \u201cLike, magically? Can you turn into a bat, too? Or a wolf?\u201d</p><p>He looked at me as if I were the one being out of the ordinary. \u201cOf course not. And yes, I discovered soon after Benedikt was born that I could alter my appearance to show age if I so chose. When my wife died, it changed back without me being aware of it until one day Imogen pointed out that I looked younger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you get younger?\u201d</p><p>He gave a little shrug. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t something I consciously controlled. I assume it was just how I was comfortable appearing to others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. That\u2019s...wow. I guess it must be so you guys don\u2019t stand out in a crowd,\u201d I said, musing on the idea. \u201cI mean, a person who never ages would attract attention. But what did your servants think when you started to go back to Nikola Prime?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were living in Vienna when she died. Following that, I went back to England for a few years, then returned here with the servants, and opened up Andras Castle again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClever. So, can you do it right now?\u201d</p><p>He looked startled. \u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChange so you look older? I wouldn\u2019t make such a big fuss about it, but my cousin is going to bring my things to the hotel, and I don\u2019t want her thinking I\u2019m cradle robbing.\u201d</p><p>He stopped in the middle of one of the little squares that were satellites to the center of town. His eyes narrowed in concentration as he looked at me, the irises darkening to sapphire. I watched him closely, holding my breath, not knowing what to expect.</p><p>His face shifted slightly, blurring a little, then sharpening until faint lines fanned out from his eyes. A few strands of silver appeared at his temples, barely visible, but there if you looked close enough.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s amazing! How do you do that?\u201d</p><p>He smiled, his new laugh lines crinkling in a way that made my knees want to melt. Nikola looking like he was thirty was utterly gorgeous. Nikola looking fifteen years older was mind-numbingly irresistible. I just wanted to rip off his clothes and molest him. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of shifting my mental age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>We resumed walking. \u201cI did some thinking about this when my wife complained that I would continue to look young while she aged\u2014and the day that she noticed I no longer looked as young\u2014and came to the conclusion that I could alter my appearance if I felt older or younger. I call it a mental age. It is the age that I feel I am, despite the number of years that I carry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if that\u2019s the case, then I\u2019m mentally twenty-five, which is a really scary thought, since I was a mess at twenty-five. Nikola...\u201d I stopped him with a hand on his chest. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have bitched at you and made you change how you look. That wasn\u2019t fair of me. I honestly liked you the way you were, even if I will be letting myself in for some cradle-robbing jokes. Go back to the way you are comfortable looking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you insist,\u201d he said, pulling me forward into a kiss despite the fact that we were clearly visible by everyone walking or driving through the square. His mouth was as hot as sin, and twice as delicious, and I came seriously close to just throwing caution to the wind and tackling him right then and there, but luckily, Nikola had more presence of mind than me, and managed to break off the kiss before I did so.</p><p>Not more presence of mind, sweetling. I\u2019ve just had longer to learn to control my desires. Although if we do not find a private place in the next hour, that control will be severely tested, and I will not answer for my actions.</p><p>Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll have a hotel room to...er...feed you. Um. I hate to tell you this, Nikola, but you didn\u2019t change back. You still have laugh lines and a tiny bit of silver in your hair.</p><p>\u201cYou told me to appear as I was comfortable. I have done so,\u201d he said blithely, his hand on my back as we continued through the square.</p><p>\u201cTo the left,\u201d I said, pointing and looking at him from the corner of my eye. I wanted to protest that he didn\u2019t need to stay looking older than me just to make me happy, but damn. He really was beyond sexy like this.</p><p>He smiled, and I damned my inability to keep my thoughts to myself.</p><p>\u201cWhy are we going to a hotel to meet your cousin? You said earlier that we would stay with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well...\u201d I coughed. \u201cThe bed in the room where I\u2019m staying squeaks, and I thought we\u2019d be more comfortable at a hotel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt squeaks?\u201d His eyes widened, turning to pale blue that shimmered with heat. \u201cJust so. A hotel would be better.\u201d</p><p>I ignored the fact that I was blushing like crazy, and concentrated instead on walking the next three blocks without once thinking about licking Nikola.</p><p>Or touching him.</p><p>Or rubbing myself against his naked flesh.</p><p>Sweetling, if you do not cease thinking about those things, I will bed you right here in the street, and there is not even a verge in which we might disport ourselves.</p><p>Sorry. I\u2019ll try not to think about how much I want to touch your chest, and stomach, and legs, and...and...dear god, Nikola! Stop thinking about that! It\u2019s too much! Wait...with a strap?</p><p>Yes. It holds you up at the correct angle. I\u2019m told that the sensation of such an angle is quite pleasing for the female.</p><p>My legs felt like rubber as his erotic thoughts\u2014and they were far, far more erotic than my own musings\u2014filled my brain, but we made it to the hotel without either of us embarrassing ourselves. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I left Nikola in the shade of a bookstore while I ran across the street to the hotel, and inquired of the woman at the desk if she knew of somewhere we could stable Thor.</p><p>\u201cA horse?\u201d she asked without batting so much as one eyelash. \u201cThere is a small stable to the rear of the building that my husband uses for a car he is rebuilding, but if you like, your horse could stay in one of the empty stalls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be perfect. I\u2019m happy to pay for his board, if you know of someone who can feed him and clean out his stall, and that sort of thing. I\u2019m sure my friend will make more permanent arrangements as soon as he can, but that might take a couple of days.\u201d</p> <p>The middle-aged woman smiled. \u201cDo not distress yourself with worry. It unbalances your aura.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm. OK. Can we take Thor back to the stable now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you like. I will show you the way.\u201d</p><p>The woman accompanied us around the side of the hotel (thankfully the side that had shade), to a small outbuilding that was mercifully shaded by a giant chestnut tree. She hauled open the large door to reveal four stalls, two of which were taken up by a car that was in pieces, while a third held a number of wooden crates. The fourth stall also held a couple of crates, which we moved out before settling Thor into the stall\u2019s confines.</p><p>\u201cI will call a friend at a local riding stable,\u201d the hotel woman said as she pulled out a cell phone. \u201cShe will bring hay and grain for your horse.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSome brushes and currycombs would be welcome,\u201d Nikola told her. \u201cHe will need grooming, and I am loath to leave him unbrushed.\u201d</p><p>The woman nodded, and waved us back toward the hotel as she spoke rapidly in German.</p><p>The hotel lobby was small and what travel agents would call \u201ceclectic.\u201d The owners, Gretl had told me when she was showing me around town, were aging hippies who had moved to Austria from Canada, and were heavily active in the arts and crafts community. I stood next to a zebra-striped love seat, eyeing a tall lamp topped with a yellow satin fringed lampshade, while Nikola stood considering a red and pink heart-print sofa. I was in full agreement with Gretl\u2019s assessment that the hotel was an acquired taste.</p><p>\u201cThis furniture,\u201d Nikola said, his gaze moving over to a spotted green beanbag chair. He checked himself. \u201cIt is furniture, is it not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I glanced over my shoulder to make sure that the hotel owner wasn\u2019t within earshot. \u201cVery odd furniture, but it\u2019s meant to be sat on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is quite unique. I like the colors on that chest.\u201d</p> <p>A purple, green, and teal standing chest of drawers in the corner had been painted with various African animals. The squat legs of the chest were done in purple and white stripes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s...special. Thank god, there\u2019s Gretl.\u201d</p><p>I ran to the (yellow polka-dot) door to hug Gretl when she came in hauling my duffel bag. \u201cGretl! Oh my god, you don\u2019t know how happy I am to see you again!\u201d</p><p>She dropped the bag and hugged me back, immediately going into full scold mode. \u201cWhere have you been? Why did you not call me if you decided to go somewhere on your own? Do you know how worried I\u2019ve been? The police, they said they could not find proof that you traveled anywhere, but I was sure that you had been abducted, and they would not do anything. Oh, Io! I have been so worried!\u201d</p><p>It took a good five minutes to calm her down to the point where she listened to my repeated apologies, and the (admittedly flimsy) story I made up about falling asleep in the forest and waking up to find my things stolen, followed by a brief spate of mental confusion (which she had no trouble believing, drat her) that led me to wander the area until I was given succor by a kindly individual in the person of Nikola.</p><p>She took one look at Nikola, and the objections to the likeliness of my spending a few days with a stranger evaporated on her lips. After considering him for a few seconds, she spoke to him in German.</p><p>He answered in English. \u201cI have family who live in this area, and was visiting them when I found Io lost. She seemed rather dazed and confused about where she was\u2014\u201d</p><p>I like the fact that you\u2019re telling the absolute truth, and yet it\u2019s coming out in a way that won\u2019t have her calling the police.</p> <p>It is a gift, he said modestly.</p><p>\u201c\u2014so naturally, I did what I could to provide a safe haven for her.\u201d</p><p>After insisting I was a prostitute.</p><p>It seemed likely that you were, given your ensemble and the circumstances. I will point out that I have apologized for that mistaken belief a number of times.</p><p>Once. You apologized once. Once does not a number of times make. And don\u2019t you dare tell me that I\u2019m nitpicking, because I know I am. I just felt it was important to mention that you thought I was a hooker long before I molested you.</p><p>Why would I wish to pick a nit? he asked, genuinely confused.</p><p>We\u2019ll have that colloquial chat soon, I promised, and turned my attention back to Gretl, who was now saying polite things about him taking me in, while gently chastising me for not calling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I forgot your phone number, and I didn\u2019t have my cell phone,\u201d I lied, thanking heaven that her number was unlisted. \u201cNikola brought me back here as soon as possible, and by then, I had remembered what your phone number was, and so here we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said slowly, her gaze shifting from Nikola to me. I don\u2019t think she believed my story, but luckily, she was distracted by him, and didn\u2019t grill me further about the missing things. \u201cYou are going to stay here?\u201d</p><p>The unspoken question was whether Nikola was going to stay with me.</p><p>I smiled, and tried to not look like the sort of a woman who hooks up with a man after a few hours\u2019 acquaintanceship. \u201cYes, Nikola thought he\u2019d like to see the fair while it\u2019s still here, and he\u2019s happy to show me around the area, so I thought we\u2019d stay at the hotel so as not to disturb you if we come in late at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow very thoughtful of you,\u201d she said, her lips twitching a little. She glanced back at Nikola, a faint line between her brows. \u201cHave we met before? You seem familiar to me, but I can\u2019t quite remember where it was we met.\u201d</p><p>Nikola made a courtly bow that made my stomach go all wobbly. \u201cI cannot say that I\u2019ve had the honor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...as it happens, Nikola is related to Imogen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is?\u201d Gretl looked delighted. Nikola looked surprised. \u201cImogen is a very old friend of mine. How are you related to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s her...er...cousin.\u201d</p><p>I most certainly am not.</p><p>No, but there\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019m going to try to explain that you are Imogen\u2019s dad when you look younger than Gretl does. You\u2019re just going to have to be Imogen\u2019s cousin to the folks who don\u2019t understand about vampires and immortality.</p><p>\u201cHe looks like Imogen\u2019s brother, so that\u2019s probably where you see the resemblance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBenedikt resembles me,\u201d Nikola said firmly, with a pointed look at me.</p><p>I smiled, and took my things from Gretl, tucking away my passport and credit cards. \u201cShall we meet for dinner? I\u2019m going to get a room and go take a proper bath...er...take a bath, but if you\u2019d like to meet for dinner, that would be great.\u201d</p><p>She demurred, her eyes on Nikola before giving me a look that let me know she wanted to say something in private.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk you out to your car,\u201d I said, dropping the duffel bag at Nikola\u2019s feet. \u201cBe right back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you to be careful,\u201d Gretl said as soon as we were out of earshot. \u201cBecause you are old enough to know what you are doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. I realize this is a bit unexpected and certainly out of character for me, but Nikola is a very nice guy, and he...uh... I promised to help him with a little research problem, so I\u2019m going to be busy with that for some time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cResearch problem? He is a scientist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a manner of speaking. More freelance than official,\u201d I said, hedging wildly, but luckily, Gretl didn\u2019t seem to notice.</p><p>\u201cI would have thought he was an actor. Why is he in period costume if he is not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReenactors,\u201d I said quickly. \u201cHe belongs to a reenactor group that...uh...reenacts.\u201d I winced at just how stupid I sounded.</p><p>\u201cI do not know of any historical reenactment groups in this area,\u201d she said, her brow furrowed in thought. \u201cIs he perhaps from Vienna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s it. You don\u2019t mind if I stay with him, do you? I wouldn\u2019t want to hurt your feelings, especially after you invited me to come and stay with you for the summer\u2014\u201d</p><p>She patted my hand and stopped my pathetic apology. \u201cMy dear, if you have found a man with whom you have a future to share, then I am very happy for you. It is my fondest wish, you know. No, I am not hurt, and I do not mind that you should wish to stay with him, although I do warn you to be careful. We know nothing about him, about who he is, what he has done in the past.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, a wry little smile to be sure, but still a smile. \u201cHis past isn\u2019t as murky as you might think. I\u2019ll call you tomorrow just to let you know I\u2019m still alive and kicking, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake care, Io,\u201d she said, giving me another hug before getting into her car.</p><p>I returned to the hotel lobby, nodding when Nikola asked me if my cousin was safely dispatched.</p><p>Yes. She\u2019s worried that you might have an unsavory past, and could possibly turn out to be a deranged ax murderer or something like that.</p><p>She is a wise woman, he answered, startling me. It is the truth that you do not know me. I could indeed be a murderer.</p><p>I looked at him as I tried to take back my duffel bag. I may not have known you for long, Nikola, but I think I\u2019d feel if you were so twisted inside that you could murder people. You\u2019re actually just the opposite.</p><p>What is the opposite of a murderer? One who gives life?</p><p>Not so much literally, but yes, you do give life. Or rather, you make lives better. You don\u2019t think I didn\u2019t notice that every servant you have is in some way askew from normal? I bet it wouldn\u2019t have been easy for your crippled groom to have found work anywhere else, or for Elizabet to have gainful employment with one working arm, or even for that flaming footman to have a job where he wasn\u2019t abused for his sexual proclivities. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Given some of the noblemen in Austria, he might have gone far, Nikola replied with wry humor.</p><p>Even your horses are, for lack of a better word, runts of the litter. Thor has one eye and is missing an ear. The horse you rode has scars all up and down her chest and front legs. I read Black Beauty as a child, you know. I\u2019m well aware that in your time appearance was everything, and there you were riding around on horses that any other man of consequence would have sent to the knacker.</p><p>It was merely a matter of convenience, nothing more, he objected. I couldn\u2019t be bothered to replace something so trivial as a horse or a servant. I had important, weighty matters on my mind. That is all.</p> <p>Uh-huh. I touched his hand. You\u2019ve got an emptiness inside you, but it\u2019s not evil. And if you\u2019d just let go of my bag, I could get us a room and then show you just how much I appreciate the fact that you\u2019re not going to kill me in my sleep and chop me up into little bits.</p><p>I will carry your bag.</p><p>I sighed, and marched over to the registration desk (lavender with green tree frogs painted on the top). There was a brief tussle when Nikola wished to do the registering for a room.</p><p>You may think I\u2019m old-fashioned as often as you like\u2014although I should point out that I was born in 1637, so technically, I am old-fashioned\u2014but I have yet to be accused of not knowing what\u2019s proper and what\u2019s not, and allowing a woman to register a hotel room for me, as well as pay for it, is not proper. Cease offering that woman the small item you insist she needs. My money is perfectly good.</p><p>It\u2019s called a credit card, and your money is made of gold, three-hundred-year-old gold. Just one of those coins you tried to give her could rent a room here for a year. Nikola, please put your money away. I will allow you to pay me for the room if you like, but let me put it on my credit card\u2014otherwise we\u2019ll stand out, and I don\u2019t think we need any more attention than you are already getting being dressed as you are.</p> <p>He looked down at himself, then out the window to where people were strolling down the street, enjoying the sunny afternoon. Some men were in jeans or other types of pants, but most wore knee-length shorts and T-shirts.</p><p>\u201cI see that the fashion for breeches remains, but do not men wear stockings in your time?\u201d he asked a few minutes later as we walked up two flights of stairs to our room. \u201cOr waistcoats?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guys in shorts weren\u2019t wearing breeches. They\u2019re actually walking shorts, and their shirts were T-shirts. So no, no stockings and fancy breeches, or heavily embroidered waistcoats, or even the fancy coat you\u2019re wearing over all of it. They do wear ties, although they\u2019re not as big as your neckcloth. We\u2019ll have to go shopping after I\u2019ve had a bath in a real bathtub.\u201d</p><p>It was fascinating to watch Nikola be introduced to new things. I explained briefly about the telephone, radio, and TV that sat in the room, then stood back and watched him approach them in what he considered a scientific method. He asked questions about each item\u2014almost all of which I couldn\u2019t answer\u2014then proceeded to make little sketches of them in his notebook, as well as copious notes.</p><p>\u201cLet me show you how to use the toilet,\u201d I said, going into the small attached bathroom.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to use the toilet,\u201d he protested, following me into the room.</p> <p>\u201cNo, but you might at some point.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThat will not happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it will. Are you embarrassed because my toilets are nicer than your toilets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in the least. I\u2019m simply saying that I do not need to use one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, you mean never?\u201d I gawked at him. \u201cVampires don\u2019t pee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have no need to do so, no.\u201d</p><p>My level of gawking increased. \u201cBut...but how does your body get rid of waste?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIt no longer creates waste. Thus the functions associated with that are dormant.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s really handy. I wish I could do the same thing. Boy, the savings on toilet paper alone must be staggering. All right, so no toilet. Now, this is the shower. You do take showers, right? I mean, you were taking a bath last night when I walked in on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we bathe,\u201d he said with a look that told me he was this close to rolling his eyes. \u201cWe also cleanse our teeth, comb our hair, and shave our whiskers.\u201d</p><p>I showed him how to turn on the shower, and then, feeling somewhat itchy, said, \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve got three hundred years of dirt on me, so I\u2019m going to take a shower. Why don\u2019t you watch TV for a bit while I\u2019m doing so, and when I\u2019m done, I\u2019ll feed you, and most likely seduce you like you\u2019ve never been seduced before.\u201d</p><p>He looked interested at that suggestion, and went into the other room while I disrobed and got into the shower. I was just sighing with happiness as I used a tiny sample bottle of shampoo when Nikola asked, What is it you\u2019re doing that gives you so much pleasure?</p><p>Just enjoying the amenities of modern life. Did you turn the TV on?</p><p>Yes. It is interesting, like a lantern show, but with much more detail. I approve of it. You will explain how it works to me later.</p><p>Um. Yeah. We\u2019ll consult Wikipedia. I took up the body shampoo and sea sponge, soaping myself up in a businesslike manner that suddenly ceased when I felt Nikola\u2019s stunned interest. Is anything the matter?</p><p>No. The word came out strangled. Continue cleansing your body.</p><p>I slid my hands, soapy and wet, down my breasts. If you insist.</p><p>My hands went even lower, swirling little soapy circles on my stomach before sliding onward to more personal parts.</p><p>He moaned into my head. Oh, yes, right there, sweetling. Touch yourself there again.</p><p>I did, thrilled not by the touch of my own fingers, but by the incredible arousal that Nikola felt at my doing so.</p><p>I shifted, swirling long, soapy curlicues down the fronts of my legs, then up the backs to my behind.</p><p>He moaned again.</p><p>Do your belly once more, he demanded, panting a little into my mind.</p><p>I looked critically at the shower, decided that although it wasn\u2019t any too large, I wasn\u2019t going to kick up a fuss at being too cramped.</p><p>I\u2019d rather, I said, soaping my breasts again, that you be the one to wash my belly. And whatever else might strike your fancy.</p><p>The words had barely left my mind before he was there, naked, the door to the shower flung open, allowing cooler air to swirl around me for a second or two. \u201cI am your servant, madame.\u201d</p><p>I giggled as he took the sponge from me, about to turn around to face him, but unable to do so when he pulled me backward against his body, his hands busily possessing themselves of my breasts and stomach and pubic areas. \u201cA less servile man I have never met, Nikola. Oh, merciful heavens, do that again!\u201d</p><p>His fingers dipped and swirled and teased sensitive flesh, sending me immediately soaring. \u201cIf you bend forward, I will be able to make love to you,\u201d he murmured in my ear as I rocked my pelvis against his magic fingers.</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t enough room for me to bend forward,\u201d I pointed out, my body tightening in anticipation. \u201cHow about if I turn around, and you hoist me up and we do it that way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are too slippery for me to hold safely,\u201d he said, the hardness of his penis rubbing along my behind. \u201cPut your hands on the floor. There is enough room for you to double over in that manner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m likely to drown in that position. Or at least get water up my nose, which isn\u2019t at all pleasant. How about if we turn sideways, I wrap one leg around you, while supporting myself on the other?\u201d</p><p>He bit my shoulder, just a little love bite, but the hunger swept over him in an overpowering, consuming wave of need and want. You are not tall enough that I would be able to accommodate you.</p><p>I\u2019m perfectly normal in height, thank you.</p><p>Wrap one of your legs around me, and brace the other against the wall. That will allow me to support you without letting you slip.</p><p>You mean like this? Ow! Ow ow ow! Leg cramp! Wait a sec, let\u2019s try this: You squish me against the wall and I can brace both legs against the opposite wall, with you in between.</p><p>That sounds most awkward. If we turn so that my back is to the water, and you stand on your hands, you can wrap your legs around my waist, and\u2014</p><p>\u201cOh, screw this,\u201d I said, driven half-mad with need just by his emotions alone. I spun the shower knob to turn off the water, threw open the shower door, and pulled Nikola out to the bedroom.</p><p>We didn\u2019t make it to the bed.</p><p>Floor! I demanded.</p><p>This is much easier, he agreed when I tumbled to the soft carpet, my hands everywhere as I tried to touch and taste all of him at once. I nipped his hip, I bit his thigh, I nibbled on his ribs all the while that he was nipping, biting, and nibbling on me. At one point, I was trying to bite his ear just as he was about to do the same, and I cracked my head on his, biting a bit harder than I intended.</p><p>He jerked back, and to my horror, I saw a drop of blood on the curve of his ear. \u201cOh, Nikola! I\u2019m so sorry. You moved just as I was going to nibble\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it again!\u201d he commanded, burying his face in my neck.</p><p>I will, but not so hard this time, I answered as I kissed his ear, intending to brush away the drop of blood. Some deep-seated need had me licking it off, though, part of my mind recoiling at the thought that I might pick up some horrible disease from him, the other part savoring the sweetly spicy taste of his blood.</p><p>By the time I was in a frenzy of lust, he stretched over me, his eyes blazing a dark topaz blue. I will not ask if you are ready for me, because I can feel that you\u2014</p><p>\u201cToo much talking! Not enough action!\u201d I grabbed his butt and wrapped my legs around his hips, urging him with mind and body to send me flying into the wonderful Land of Orgasm.</p><p>You are the most irreverent, brazen, delectably delicious woman I have ever known, he murmured into my mind, groaning out loud when he slid into my body. I swear my eyes just about crossed at the sensation, but it wasn\u2019t until I felt his breath on my neck, followed by the graze of his teeth, that I gave myself up to the pleasure that only he could bring me. The sharp, hot pain of his bite was followed instantly by the soul-deep satisfaction that he felt as our bodies were joined together, my life flowing to him even as he allowed himself his own moment of pure rapture. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd you are the most amazing lover I\u2019ve ever had. That was indescribable, Nikola,\u201d I said some five minutes later, when I managed to get my brain working again. \u201cI keep thinking you can\u2019t possibly get any better, and yet you do. You\u2019re going to kill me with sex one of these days, you know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can but try,\u201d he said, rolling off me to lie on the floor, his chest damp with exertion.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d I reached a languid hand over to pinch him. \u201cIt\u2019s rude to tell the person you just pleasured to the moon and back that you want her dead.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t smile and make a joke, as I expected him to. Instead he opened his eyes and gave me a curious look. \u201cHow attached are you to your soul?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I sat up and turned to look at him. He lay before me like a statue of one of those Greek gods come to life, all lines of thick muscles, and sculpted expanses of flesh that, even sated as I was, made my mouth water. \u201cWhat the hell sort of question is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA straightforward one. How attached are you to the idea of having a soul?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... I... I don\u2019t know how to answer that. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever thought about my soul. In fact, I didn\u2019t really think it existed until you said you lost yours when\u2014hey! You don\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cIf you would not miss it, I could locate a demon lord, and arrange it so that you, too, could become a Dark One.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou want me to become a vampire?\u201d I was shocked by that statement, shocked and horrified, and for a second terrified.</p><p>\u201cI want you to stay with me.\u201d The words were spoken with simple honesty, which in itself might have given me pause, but it was the emotion behind the words that kept me from recoiling from him. \u201cIf you were as I am, then you would not die, and we would never be separated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you... Nikola, are you saying you\u2019re in love with me?\u201d</p><p>He looked thoughtful, one hand absently scratching his chest. \u201cI came to the conclusion many years ago that I do not know how to love a woman. I love my daughter, of course, but she is my child. I tried to love my wife, since she was due that honor, but...there was something lacking in me. I enjoy being with you, Io. I enjoy your mind, and the times when our bodies join together. It pleases me that you enjoy me, as well, and I wish for you to remain at my side for as many years as I can envision being granted to me, but I am a Dark One. I will not die of old age, and you will. I do not wish for you to do so. I would that you were like Imogen, immortal, and able to accompany me through the path of life. If that is love, then yes, I am capable of love for you.\u201d</p><p>I sat silent for a few minutes, trying to work through everything he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat of you?\u201d he asked, suddenly looking very vulnerable and unsure.</p> <p>I leaned down to kiss him, allowing my lips to linger on his warm, so very sweet mouth. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I feel, either, Nikola. I like you a lot, more than any other man I\u2019ve ever known. I want to be with you, too, and I think that it would probably be very easy for me to fall in love with you, but I don\u2019t want to become a vampire. I just... I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s for me.\u201d</p><p>His expression grew shuttered, and he started to roll away from me, the hurt so deep in him that it made tears sting my eyes. \u201cNo, wait,\u201d I said, grabbing his arm and forcing him to turn back toward me. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t want to spend my life with you. I think I do, I really think I do. But not at the cost of my soul. If there was a way I could become like Imogen, but keep my soul\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cImogen has her soul,\u201d he interrupted.</p><p>I stared down at him, his eyes once again a pale frosty blue. \u201cShe does? But I thought she\u2019s a vamp, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is a Moravian, but she has her soul. My son does not, but she does.\u201d His eyes narrowed in thought. \u201cI have wondered if it was due to her gender that she was allowed to retain her soul, while Benedikt was not. I have long meant to contact the Moravian Society to inquire about that, but more important studies always seemed to claim my time. However, I shall make the time to contact the society when we return home.\u201d</p><p>I let that subject go in favor of one more important. \u201cSo you think maybe there\u2019s a way I can be like Imogen? Because I would do that. So long as I could keep my soul, I would do that. It would hurt to see the few family members I have, like Gretl, grow old and eventually die, but that can happen at any time, and...and...well, to be honest, I can see myself spending a long, long time with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we are in agreement,\u201d he said, one hand sliding down my back to my behind. \u201cWe will find a way for you to become a Moravian like Imogen\u2014without sacrificing your soul\u2014and you will return with me to my home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice try to slip that last bit in while distracting me with a butt grope,\u201d I said, leaning down to kiss him again.</p> <p>He pulled me across his body, his legs capturing mine, erotic thoughts dancing once again in his brain. I let him fulfill all his smutty thoughts, content that, at least for the moment, we were of one mind.</p><p>16 July 2012</p><p>\u201cHey, Mr. Sleepyhead, wake up or we\u2019re going to miss the fair, and it\u2019s the last night for it, so we really should go so you can see Imogen and Ben.\u201d</p><p>The voice that woke Nikola was filled with warmth and happiness, and made him think of pleasurable afternoons spent in bedsport. \u201cI\u2019m sleeping. You have exhausted me with your demands for sensual delights, and I, being a mere man, have used up all my strength ensuring the fulfillment of your many needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a vampire, and everyone knows vampires don\u2019t take naps. Besides, you\u2019ve slept for three hours, and if Mr. Pokey down there is any indicator, you\u2019re more than rarin\u2019 to go again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may be a Dark One, you insatiably sassy wench, but I am also a man, and thus I need copious amounts of sleep after pleasuring my woman to the tips of her toes. What is that?\u201d He squinted at a large yellow glossy object she set next to him on the edge of the bed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor me?\u201d He sat up, anticipation driving away the need to sleep. He had a secret love of receiving unexpected presents, something he\u2019d never before told another person, but here was Io handing him some sort of slippery yellow paper that evidently contained a present. He was extraordinarily pleased.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t even opened it,\u201d Io laughed, pushing the object toward him. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you look so happy about it when you haven\u2019t seen what I got you. I had to guess your size, and you may not like them, but if we want to go out and about, you need something a little more conventional to wear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGarments?\u201d he asked, pulling out of the slippery yellow substance an item that was clearly meant to be a shirt, although it lacked attributes with which he was familiar. It was followed by a clear slippery package that contained other objects, some sort of abbreviated black stockings that looked as if they\u2019d barely go over his ankles, a somewhat worn pair of blue breeches, and an odd pair of shoes that had no laces whatsoever.</p><p>He loved them all. They were presents that she had picked out just for him, not for any other man, but for him. She had put much thought into them, considered what he might like, and chosen items that she knew would satisfy his needs and desires and wants.</p><p>She had brought him presents, surprise presents, presents he wasn\u2019t in the least bit anticipating. He wanted to touch all the presents, wanted to lay her out on the bed and show them to her before stripping her naked and licking every inch of her supple, silky body. He was, in fact, trying to work out a way to combine the special joy of both touching his presents and engaging in lovemaking with her when she asked, in a hesitant voice, \u201cDo you like them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are tolerable,\u201d he said, going for a lofty, disinterested tone, as befitted a man of his stature.</p><p>\u201cMan of your stature, my shiny pink butt,\u201d she said, smacking him on the arm, her smile belying the words. \u201cDo you like the color of the shirt? I wanted to get a red one, because red silk is just so yummy, but then I saw this blue one that matches your eyes, and I couldn\u2019t resist it. And it goes nicely with the jeans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe jeans are perfect,\u201d he said, holding up the shoes to examine them.</p><p>\u201cThose are the loafers, silly. These are the jeans.\u201d She held up the long breeches. \u201cThey\u2019re stonewashed, which I don\u2019t particularly care for, but they were all the store had that I thought would fit you. Oh, there\u2019s a belt, too.\u201d</p><p>She handed him a slim black leather belt.</p><p>\u201cThere are castles on it,\u201d he said, examining the embossing on the leather.</p><p>\u201cYeah, kind of touristy, but I figured no one would look too closely at it, so you wouldn\u2019t mind\u2014Nikola, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>His throat tightened painfully. He had to swallow three times before he could finally get out, \u201cNothing is wrong. I am simply admiring the castles on the belt that you have given me.\u201d</p><p>She watched him for a moment, her eyes concerned; then to his surprise she took the belt and shoes from his hands, pushed him onto his back, and leaned down, taking his face in her hands. \u201cYou are the sweetest man I know. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re all verklempt because I bought you a few things to wear. Surely you must have received presents in the past?\u201d</p><p>\u201cImogen embroidered handkerchiefs for me each Twelfth Night,\u201d he admitted. \u201cMy wife would sometimes make me stockings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s it? Socks and hankies? No one ever gave you anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy wife gave me children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t count. Oh, my poor, sweet darling\u2014\u201d He allowed her to kiss his face and chest, enjoying greatly the little murmurs she made as she did so.</p><p>He was ready and willing to make love to her right then and there, but Io had other ideas.</p><p>\u201cLater, punkin, later. Right now, we need to get you dressed so you can take me out and feed me, because I\u2019m so famished I could just about eat your belt.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He quickly snatched the item in question out of her reach, just in case she wasn\u2019t joking. After a short bit of explanation as to what the mysterious slithery material was (he made note of the word \u201cplastic,\u201d since Io used it a lot), he donned the male undergarments she said were commonplace, not at all displeased with how the silken material caressed his nether parts. By the time he had clad himself in the shirt, long breeches, and shoes, he felt very much like an adventurer about to step onto unknown shores.</p><p>\u201cWell, it is kind of an adventure,\u201d Io agreed as they left the hotel. \u201cI know I felt that way once I figured out I had traveled back in time. Oooh, a burger place, just what I want. You aren\u2019t going to mind if I eat in front of you? I hate to be rude, but I\u2019m starving, and I know you can\u2019t eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can if I have to, but I see no need to do so. I am quite satisfied after dining earlier,\u201d he said, unable to keep from pinching her adorable bottom.</p> <p>She squealed, and, with a promise to be right back, hurried across the road to a small building that bore pictures of odd-looking food products on its walls. He contented himself with watching her, frowning when a man nearby turned to look at her as she walked past, automatically reaching for the saber he wore at his side.</p><p>Dammit, Io had made him leave it back at the hotel room, claiming that a weapon like that would attract attention from the local magistrates.</p><p>\u201cI am the law at my home,\u201d he said under his breath as he waited for Io. \u201cNo one would dare look at my woman in such a manner. No one would tell me I cannot defend what is mine. I dislike being incommoded in this fashion\u2014\u201d</p><p>His grumbling stopped abruptly when he caught sight of a familiar shape suddenly made visible as a wave of local villagers, strolling around the shops and businesses, parted briefly. Although the man had his back to Nikola, he could have sworn that it was his brother Rolf.</p><p>Had Rolf produced descendants after all? Ones who resembled him? He moved through the crowd intent on seeing the man better, but he disappeared into the crowd by the time Nikola had reached the spot where he had stood.</p> <p>Nikola glanced around him, but was unable to find anyone who resembled the man he sought. He did, however, notice a shop behind him that had the words WE BUY GOLD on the window. He was reminded of Io\u2019s explanation of how money worked in her century, and accordingly stepped into the shop, a few of his coins in his hand.</p><p>When he emerged a few minutes later, having sold only one coin, the shop owner saw him to the door saying, \u201cI wish I could buy your entire collection, but as I told the other gentleman who offered me some silver coins, I cannot buy more than one without some form of identification. It is the law, you understand. If you bring me your passport, then I will be able to purchase more coins from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will discuss your offer with my woman. She knows more about these things than me,\u201d Nikola said politely, carefully putting into his pocket the paper money the man had given him. He had to admit that even though he wasn\u2019t used to wearing long breeches, the ones that Io had given him were quite comfortable, and had handy pockets that he would make sure were included in all his breeches from that moment forward.</p><p>\u201cEr...all right.\u201d The man waved him off, and as Nikola returned to the shop where Io had gone to find food, he felt much more in control. He had clothing that would allow him to blend in, and now he had currency that would allow him to purchase anything he might need.</p><p>He was planning on buying some sort of present for Io when she hurried up to him with a small bag in one hand, while jamming some sort of long strips of food into her mouth with the other. \u201cSorry to take so long. You sure you don\u2019t want anything? I got two burgers, and a jumbo fries in case you wanted to try modern food. You know, the kind without maggots all over it.\u201d</p><p>He sniffed at her food, but it held no appeal to him. It certainly couldn\u2019t come close to the scent of her that perpetually teased his nose and left him halfway aroused just being near her. \u201cI do not require food other than you, thank you.\u201d</p> <p>She sighed blissfully as she ate another handful of the strips, sliding one arm through his and directing them to the main street that led out of town. \u201cI\u2019ll eat as we walk to the fair, if you don\u2019t mind. It\u2019s not a long walk, and although I could rent a car, I think we\u2019ll have to ease you into the complexities of modern vehicles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have to do so if you had allowed me to examine the FedEx,\u201d he pointed out, turning to stare at a woman who emerged from a shop clad in small scraps of clothing that barely hid her breasts and woman\u2019s parts.</p><p>\u201cOh, that lady would have loved\u2014what\u2019s wrong? Oh.\u201d Io smothered a laugh as his gaze went from the nearly naked woman to her. \u201cThat\u2019s a bikini. It\u2019s what some women who don\u2019t have any body fat wear when they go swimming or, in that woman\u2019s case, to a tanning salon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI begin to see that there may be some merits to your century,\u201d Nikola said with a little smile.</p><p>She punched him in the arm, just as he knew she would do.</p><p>\u201cDawg. Did you people watch while I was in the fast-food place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI exchanged one of my coins for your currency. Look.\u201d He stopped and pulled out the wad of paper money, showing it to her. \u201cDid I negotiate an adequate amount for one coin? The man was quite excited about my coins, and wished only to give me ten paper monies for one, but I told him I must have more. He did not like that, but I know merchants well, and knew he would not offer me a fair price at first. After bargaining for a few minutes, he gave in and gave me these many monies, and I felt that it was a fair exchange. He also wished to purchase the rest of my coins, but said I must have identification in order for him to do so. I do not have a passport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I have one. Maybe I could\u2014\u201d Io\u2019s eyes widened at the sight of the money, and glancing around quickly, she shoved his hand toward his pocket. \u201cPut that away! I don\u2019t know that there are pickpockets around here, but fairs usually have them, so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised. And yes, that\u2019s a metric butt ton of money, so you did very well.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood.\u201d He was pleased that he had such success in her world with his first attempt. He must be sure to make notes about it later, so as to document how well he did here. \u201cNow I will pay for our lodgings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust one of those bills will pay for a whole week,\u201d Io said, unwrapping some food and taking a bite. \u201cNot to change the subject, but I think we should discuss what you\u2019re going to say when you see Imogen and your son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m going to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t freak them out by suddenly appearing from the past. Imogen said you had died, remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI find it difficult to forget something like my own death,\u201d he said drily.</p><p>\u201cAlthough oddly enough, Ben said you were alive and well and living in South America ogling nubile young girls.\u201d She gave him a long look. \u201cObviously, given the fact that your brothers were trying to kill you, he was lying about your death, but I\u2019m curious as to why he\u2019d do that. I don\u2019t suppose you have any insight into that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Benedikt felt it necessary to speak falsely about me, I\u2019m sure he had a very good reason,\u201d he answered with serenity. There might be many unknowns in his life\u2014and certainly more so now that he found himself in a world that was full of oddities\u2014but in one thing he was confident: the integrity of his children. \u201cI cannot anticipate what that might be, but I am sure that Benedikt will explain himself. I admit that I will be pleased to see them. I was just returning home from leaving Benedikt at the university in Heidelberg when you ran into my horse. I assume they have done well for themselves over the centuries?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so,\u201d she answered rather indistinctly around a mouthful of food. \u201cI told you that Ben had a wife now. She seemed nice enough, although...\u201d Io wadded up her bag and tossed it into a round receptacle that was placed on the street. \u201cAt the time, I thought she was as bonkers as Ben, because she said she had some ghosts visiting her. But I guess now that I\u2019m dating a vampire, and have traveled through time twice, I should just stop fighting it and go with the flow. Your daughter-in-law has Viking ghosts, Nikola. Ones that seem to think she\u2019s some sort of goddess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFascinating,\u201d he said, and pulled out his notebook to make a note about interviewing the ghosts. He wished to stop and make more comprehensive notes, but Io insisted that they stop by a bank so that he could get smaller denominations of currency.</p><p>\u201cNo one would be able to make change for the sort of bills you\u2019re hauling around,\u201d she told him as they emerged into the dusky twilight that enveloped the valley.</p><p>He had been careful to keep to the shadows earlier, but now with the sun setting, he was able to join the throng of people who were streaming out of town, on foot and in the metal carriages that Io had described earlier\u2014and about which he badly wanted to make a scientific study\u2014all headed to the field outside of the town where he could see colorful tents and small oblong buildings.</p><p>\u201cRemember, we\u2019re going to tell everyone that you\u2019re Imogen and Ben\u2019s cousin,\u201d Io warned him as they stood in front of a wooden structure bearing the legend \u201cTicket Booth.\u201d Io pointed out which notes he would need for the tickets to the fair. \u201cAnd yes, I know that irks you, but there\u2019s just no way we can explain your appearance otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI look older now,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>\u201cA tiny bit, yes. Enough that I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m robbing the cradle, but certainly not old enough to have kids who are Imogen\u2019s and Ben\u2019s ages. Hi, two adults, please.\u201d</p><p>He followed after Io as she led him onto the fairgrounds, his quick gaze taking in many things. \u201cI know what a tattoo is, but what purpose does piercing offer?\u201d he asked, stopping in front of one of the booths.</p><p>Io pulled him away from the front of the intriguing images. \u201cYou truly do not want to know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He dug in his heels and refused to budge. \u201cOn the contrary, I do. I am a scientist, and more, an adventurer. You yourself said so. Thus, I must record my adventures, and I cannot do that if you tug me away from interesting ones.\u201d</p><p>She stopped trying to pull him away from the booth, gesturing toward the flap that hid the inside of the tent while saying, \u201cBy all means, go ahead and see for yourself. I wouldn\u2019t want to deprive you of an adventure, or the pursuit of knowledge.\u201d</p><p>You are smiling, he said as he entered the close confines of the tent. Inside, there was some sort of odd reclining chair, several tables, and a woman with heavily drawn black around her eyes who looked up from a journal she was reading. I suspect you know something you are not telling me. What is it?</p><p>No, no, I wouldn\u2019t want to ruin your scientific studies of piercings and modern society. You just go on and find out for yourself.</p> <p>\u201cMay I help sir?\u201d the woman asked, getting to her feet. She appeared to have small bits of metal stuck to her nose, eyebrows, and lower lip. He stared at those for a few moments before recognizing the look she was giving him.</p><p>\u201cMy woman is outside,\u201d he told her. \u201cI do not wish to have sexual congress with you.\u201d</p><p>She paused for a moment, then pursed her lips. \u201cYour loss. Do you wish for a tattoo? Piercing?\u201d She brazenly eyed the front of his breeches. \u201cWould sir be interested in a Prince Albert, perhaps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am a baron, not a prince, and my name is Nikola, not Albert,\u201d he corrected her.</p><p>The woman smiled. \u201cA Prince Albert is a piercing, Baron. A small circular barbell is inserted in your cock. It will give much pleasure to your partner, I assure you. If you would remove your jeans, I will assess you for what size barbell would be best to start with.\u201d</p> <p>He stared at the woman for a few seconds, then turned on his heel and exited the tent. Io stifled a laugh when she saw his face.</p><p>He ignored it, saying simply, \u201cThe creation of the bikini aside, I must question the sanity of your times, Io.\u201d</p><p>She laughed out loud. \u201cWhere piercings are concerned, I totally agree. The woman who runs that place wanted me to get my nipples tattooed. I shudder to think of what she offered to do to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoving along, then...if you\u2019re done exploring the subject of body enhancements, Imogen\u2019s booth is on the right, at the end. Now, be gentle with her, Nikola. She\u2019s not expecting you to suddenly come back to life, and we wouldn\u2019t want to give her a heart attack or some\u2014well, hell. She\u2019s not there.\u201d</p><p>He looked where Io pointed to a booth covered in black canvas with gold runes painted on it. \u201cMy daughter is a soothsayer?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe reads rune stones, yes.\u201d Io bit her delicious lower lip, instantly causing him to want to do the same. \u201cI wonder where she went? This is all sorts of anticlimactic, Nikola. I was ready for a happy reunion. I brought tissues and everything, in case Imogen cried buckets at seeing her beloved daddy risen from the grave\u2014hey!\u201d</p><p>Io rammed into him, half turning as she did so to glare back at the person who had shoved her.</p><p>Nikola turned to deal with the rude person, but at that moment, the crowd of fairgoers went berserk as a sense of pandemonium gripped them. Women screamed, men shouted, children shrieked in fear, and all of them turned as one body and stampeded past Nikola and Io to the open end of the fair, and safety.</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth\u2014\u201d Io started to say.</p><p>Nikola thrust her into the space between his daughter\u2019s booth and the one next to it, standing protectively in front of her so that she wouldn\u2019t be trampled.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Io said, nudging his back and trying to peer over his shoulder.</p><p>The crowd streaming past them began to thin, and he could see at the far end three men who were stalking down the center aisle, sweeping bloodied scythes before them. \u201cIt would appear the grim reaper is here. And he is a triplet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho? And what?\u201d</p> <p>Io pushed him so she could see, but he stood solid, his gaze narrowed on the three men as they approached. \u201cPerhaps it isn\u2019t the grim reaper\u2014there are three men, and other than the blood-splattered scythes they are all holding, they appear perfectly ordinary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiches!\u201d a woman with short red hair yelled as she bolted past them, following on the heels of the crowd. \u201cFor the love of the goddess, everyone take shelter! Liches are here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI stand corrected,\u201d Nikola said, watching the men. \u201cThey are evidently liches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a lich?\u201d Io asked, holding his shoulder and craning her head to see them.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea. Assumedly someone who slaughters others with iron farm implements. No, remain behind me, there is no time for me to find a place for you to seek shelter as that woman advised. I will keep you safe from harm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, one, that he-man crap doesn\u2019t pull a lot of weight with me. Well, a little, because I appreciate the fact that you\u2019re standing there thinking about ways of disarming them should they come after us, and I flunked out of my self-defense class because I get squeamish about hitting people, and yes, I know that\u2019s not the right attitude to have when defending oneself\u2014lord knows, my instructor kept telling me that self-defense wasn\u2019t about anything but keeping yourself safe\u2014but regardless, I do appreciate it, and at the same time, I don\u2019t. If you know what I mean. Which I can see that you don\u2019t by the fact that you\u2019re looking at me like I\u2019m one antler short of a reindeer.\u201d</p><p>Your conversations never fail to interest me, sweetling, but now is not the time for blethering.</p><p>I was not blethering! she said, mentally bristling. I never blether! I am not a bletherer! What\u2019s blethering? Wait, it\u2019s like babbling, isn\u2019t it? Well, Mr. My Words Are Like Pearls from a Swine\u2019s Ear\u2014</p><p>Sow.</p><p>I beg your pardon?</p><p>It\u2019s pearls from a sow\u2019s ear, not swine\u2019s ear. \u201cWhat the devil?\u201d</p><p>A small group of people ran past them from the opposite direction, a man and two women, one of whom had familiar long, blond hair.</p><p>\u201cOh, look, there\u2019s Imogen,\u201d Io said helpfully, clutching his shoulders as she peered around his head. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s your son. Hell\u2019s teeth! That\u2019s one heck of a big sword Ben\u2019s carrying!\u201d</p><p>Two other men approached, clearly following on the heels of the threesome. Nikola noted the two swords held by one of the men, and the large ax held by the other.</p><p>\u201cStay here,\u201d he said, and, reaching out, snatched one of the swords from the closest of the two men.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Nikola! Dammit, man! I will not be left\u2014holy deranged ax murderers!\u201d</p><p>Io followed him, much to his irritation. I asked you to stay back, Io, and I expect you to honor that request.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a request, it was an order. An annoying and unrealistic order. One that I\u2019d have to be an idiot to follow, so you can just stop thinking about tying me to the booth, and instead pay attention to the dude with the beard, because he doesn\u2019t look any too happy about you taking his sword, and I think he\u2019s going to\u2014look out!</p><p>Io screamed just as the man whom he had de-sworded swung at him. Everything seemed to happen at once: He slammed the hilt of the sword against the head of the man, sending him reeling backward, then on the backswing, parried a thrust by the man holding the ax, tripping him so he, too, fell over backward, crashing heavily against one of the booths. The sounds of breaking wood, tearing canvas, and the tinkle of shattered glass were followed by some profane oaths. In front of him, the man and two women stopped to look back just as the three scythe holders shouted, and ran forward toward them.</p><p>\u201cPapa?\u201d he heard the blond woman ask, her voice filled with incredulity.</p><p>\u201cNikola, wait,\u201d Io yelled, leaping over the prone form of the man with the ax, stopping to kick out his leg from under him when he tried to rise and disentangle himself from the booth.</p><p>When we return home, I will make sure to find the time to explain to you why it is that you must attend to me when I give orders, he told Io sternly as she ran up behind him, clutching the back of his shirt. Do not block my arms, sweetling. I must be able to swing the sword, and I can\u2019t do that if you are clinging to me.</p><p>Oh, sorry. She let go, her concern for him warming him to the tips of his toes. She truly cared about what happened to him, and was honestly worried that he would be harmed. He cherished that sentiment almost as much as he cherished the silk undergarments that made wearing tight breeches extremely comfortable.</p><p>Seriously? You\u2019re fawning over your undies now? I can understand some of that, because you look really hot in them, and I just want to fondle...but no, now is not the time. Pay attention, Nikola. There are baddies in front and behind you. We can discuss your underwear later, in the hotel room.</p><p>I am a Dark One, he reminded her, striding forward past where Imogen was standing and staring at him with an open mouth. You will cease worrying. It is extremely difficult to kill me. \u201cImogen, you will catch flies if your mouth hangs open like that. Benedikt, stand back. I will attend to these ruffians.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the hockey pucks is that?\u201d the tall woman next to his son asked, giving him a less-than-friendly look.</p><p>Benedikt looked older than when he had last seen him, but Nikola felt a swell of pride that his son had grown to be a man of prepossessing appearance. \u201cYour mother would be pleased,\u201d he told his son before swinging his sword, catching the nearest of the scythe wielders on the shoulder, neatly severing his arm.</p><p>The man stopped dead in his tracks, looking in blank astonishment at the sight of his arm\u2014still holding the bloody scythe\u2014lying on the ground in front of him. \u201cOy!\u201d</p><p>The man nearest him also stopped, but his attention was on Benedikt, his black eyes narrowed until they were veritable slits. \u201cThere\u2019s the Dark One! Kill the women and take him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my arm!\u201d the first man said, looking from the blood spurting from his shoulder down to the arm on the ground. \u201cOy!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOver my dead body,\u201d Benedikt growled, focused now on the threatening man. He swung a large two-handed sword that Nikola instantly coveted.</p><p>\u201cHell\u2019s teeth, you just cut off that guy\u2019s arm!\u201d Io gasped. \u201cYou just...it\u2019s...it\u2019s right there on the ground. An arm. On the ground. Not attached or anything. Are you OK?\u201d</p><p>The man she was addressing looked from his arm to Io. \u201cHe\u2019s had me arm off!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know, I can see it. It\u2019s right there in front of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOy,\u201d the man said a third time before nudging the arm with the toe of his shoe.</p><p>\u201cThe master says we has to bring you in alive,\u201d the middle scythe man snarled, spittle flying from his mouth, his lips pulled back in a sneer that Nikola felt he\u2019d tolerated long enough.</p><p>\u201cImogen, stand next to Io. You, too, woman,\u201d he told the auburn-haired woman who frowned at him. \u201cI will take care of these swine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSow,\u201d came a soft voice from behind him.</p> <p>Now is not the time to be witty, he told Io. \u201cBenedikt, can you disable the smaller man? I will take care of this nasty piece of business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father?\u201d the woman asked, her voice filled with surprise. \u201cI thought you said your dad was a jerk who was in South America hitting on all sorts of scantily clad women?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me arm,\u201d the one-handed scyther said, picking up the object in question. He tried to push it back onto his shoulder, but the arm just fell to the ground again. \u201cNow what am I supposed to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you had a decent bone in your body, you\u2019d die,\u201d Nikola told him, his sword flashing in the air when the middle scythe man, his eyes widening when he got a good look at who was attacking him, snarled an obscenity that would have made a sinner blush.</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s my father,\u201d Benedikt said, giving him an odd look before rushing at the third man, who had leaped forward toward the women.</p><p>\u201cHi, Fran. That South America stuff was just something Imogen told Ben, probably to keep him from being devastated that his dad was killed by his brothers. Nikola\u2019s brothers, not Ben\u2019s brothers. I don\u2019t think Ben has any brothers.\u201d Nikola, you don\u2019t have any other children, do you?</p> <p>Now is not the time, woman! Nikola panted, alternately parrying and thrusting to disable, disarm, or smite down the man who clearly had nefarious designs against his son and daughter. It might have escaped your attention, busy as you are discussing arms and such with the potential murderer who is even now attempting to tie his severed arm onto his body using his belt\u2014which I cannot help notice does not possess a fine embossing of castles, as my present does\u2014but I am conducting some business that requires my full attention, and thus I will be able to engage in trivial conversation with you later, after I have dispatched these rogues.</p><p>Oh, sure, when you blather, it\u2019s just fine, but when I do, I\u2019m distracting you? Men! Io winced in sympathy when the edge of the scythe slashed against his upper arm. Are you OK? That looks deep.</p><p>Not enough to hinder me. Just stay back.</p><p>\u201cImogen said what?\u201d Fran asked, shaking her head before she hefted a large mallet that had been used to pound in a stake, and took a swing at the nearest man.</p><p>\u201cIo, why are you here with my father?\u201d Imogen asked her, then spun around and shouted, \u201cFinnvid! What are you and Eirik doing back there? Why are you playing with the aura photo booth? Come and help us kill the liches!\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t take Nikola long to disable and destroy the middle lich\u2014scythes being a notoriously awkward weapon to wield in close combat\u2014after which he turned his attention to the third ruffian, but Benedikt had just knocked that man\u2019s scythe away, and was about to skewer the man with his broadsword when the woman stopped him.</p><p>\u201cNo, Ben, don\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey killed four innocent mortals!\u201d Ben snarled, raising the sword.</p> <p>The woman grabbed his arm. \u201cI know, but killing them isn\u2019t the answer. Besides, if we let them live\u2014\u201d</p><p>Nikola twirled his sword, and neatly beheaded the lich.</p><p>\u201c\u2014we can find out what they know about David. Oh.\u201d The woman turned angry eyes to him. \u201cWell, thank you very much, Ben\u2019s dad! That guy might have given us just the clue we needed to find David!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll not tell you anything,\u201d the lich\u2019s head spat out, his fierce expression made somewhat less effective by the fact that there was no body attached. \u201cNot if you tortured me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the\u2014hell\u2019s toenails!\u201d Io clutched his arm and stared at the animated head. \u201cThat guy\u2019s head is still talking!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow very curious,\u201d Nikola said, studying the head for a moment before handing Io the sword and pulling out his notebook. \u201cEvidently liches can\u2019t be destroyed by a simple decapitation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to pay for this, mate,\u201d the armless lich yelled, shaking his arm at Nikola. \u201cIt\u2019ll cost me a packet to get this reattached, and I\u2019m not going to pay for it meself!\u201d</p><p>Nikola eyed the man, then reached for the sword.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Io said, turning away. \u201cOne decapitation is enough for me today, even if the head...wow, he really does know a lot of curse words, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s quite the potty mouth,\u201d Benedikt\u2019s woman agreed.</p><p>\u201cI feel woozy,\u201d the one-armed lich said, and staggered to the side, collapsing next to a tent. \u201cSomeone fetch a healer!\u201d</p><p>The head continued to hurl abuse, alternating with some choice threats that Nikola took down carefully.</p><p>Benedikt\u2019s woman sighed. \u201cImogen, maybe we could use your scarf to gag him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad I chose this one to wear, and not one of the good silk ones,\u201d Imogen said, handing over a blue and purple strip of fabric. She turned to him and gazed with wide, blue eyes that reminded him of her mother. \u201cPapa, what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIo brought me,\u201d he said simply, still making notes as Benedikt helped his woman tie a gag around the lich\u2019s mouth. It tried to bite them, but eventually they got the scarf bound around the head a few times.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Io stopped reading over his shoulder and went to Imogen, putting an arm around her. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry! We meant to do this much differently. We wanted to break it to you gently that your father was still alive, and not killed by your uncles as you\u2019ve believed all these years, but then those men attacked\u2014exactly what is a lich? And why did they have scythes, of all things? And then there you were, and of course, there was no time to explain everything. I hope we haven\u2019t given you some sort of a trauma by having Nikola come back from the dead like that, but...um...well, here he is!\u201d</p><p>Benedikt turned to face them, his face stony. \u201cAnd I wish to hell he\u2019d go back to wherever it is he crawled from.\u201d</p><p>July 16</p><p>\u201cI hope you realize just how incredibly lucky you are that at this moment I don\u2019t have a blunt object at hand,\u201d I told Ben, moving to stand in front of Nikola. I\u2019m not normally an aggressive person, but I couldn\u2019t believe what a bastard Ben was being to his father. Of all the nerve, telling him he wanted him gone!</p><p>\u201cAre you threatening him?\u201d Fran asked, an expression of utter incredulity chasing amusement across her face.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, I am,\u201d I said, lifting my chin and just daring either Ben or her to laugh at me. \u201cYour father was excited and happy to see you again, and for you to say such hurtful and cruel things to him after what he\u2019s been through\u2014well, you seriously have a smack upside the head coming, that\u2019s all I\u2019ll say!\u201d</p><p>Nikola sighed and put away his notebook. \u201cIo, do not upset yourself. You told me that Benedikt was not told the truth about my death. He is obviously reacting to whatever falsehood Imogen saw fit to tell him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell him a falsehood of any sort,\u201d Imogen said slowly, her expression suddenly wary.</p><p>\u201cOf course you did. You told Ben that his dad was alive and kicking in Rio or somewhere, obviously because you wanted to save him the horror of knowing Nikola was killed by your uncles. I don\u2019t blame you, although I would have thought, at seventeen, Ben could have handled the news, but you clearly felt otherwise\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Io, I didn\u2019t,\u201d Imogen interrupted, moving over to stand next to Ben. \u201cI didn\u2019t lie to Benedikt.... I lied to you. When I said my father died that night more than three hundred years ago, I was speaking more figuratively than literally.\u201d</p><p>I gawked at her. What the hell?</p><p>I don\u2019t know. Nikola tucked away his notebook and frowned at Imogen. Obviously, something has occurred about which we know nothing.</p><p>\u201cDammit, I knew if I brought you back with me, something horrible would happen to the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about\u2014there you are.\u201d Imogen turned to face the two men whom Nikola had disabled earlier. Both men looked like they wanted to pick a fight with him.</p><p>They\u2019re welcome to try, Nikola said with some amusement.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you doing back there?\u201d Imogen asked one of them, the one who was clutching the ax and glaring at Nikola. \u201cYou were supposed to help us. As it is, my father took care of the liches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father?\u201d the man asked, his frown fading. \u201cThe one who ogles women in Brazil?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s better than lizards taking over,\u201d I told Nikola. \u201cAlthough really, it\u2019s not very nice to know everyone thinks you\u2019re a smutmonger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmut\u2014\u201d Nikola pulled his notebook out and made another note.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s him. And this is Io. She\u2019s the cousin of a friend of mine. And...erm...somehow knows my father.\u201d</p><p>A little blush crept up my chest. I coughed. \u201cWe...uh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIo is my lover,\u201d Nikola said, sliding an arm around me. \u201cShe does a great many things to me that bring me much pleasure, and which I have not enjoyed since your mother died. I will not discuss them further, however, because you are yet an innocent maiden, and it is not suitable that you should know such things. However, I wish to put your mind to rest, since I know you are worried that I am lonely. Io has agreed to spend her life with me. We are in pursuit of a method by which we can make her Moravian without losing her soul. She does not wish to be soulless. I have told her it isn\u2019t that bad, but she is adamant, and I must honor her wishes in this regard.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The others stared at us like we were both buck naked and dancing the cancan.</p><p>To my complete surprise, Ben leaned forward and sniffed the air, an indefinable expression crossing his face.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s what?\u201d Fran said almost in a shriek.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s faint, but it\u2019s there,\u201d Ben said, giving me an odd look. \u201cEvidently she\u2019s his Beloved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I realize that Nikola could have broken the news about our relationship in a more fitting manner, but really, what we do behind closed doors is our business,\u201d I told Ben, feeling irritable for some reason. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if it upsets you that your dad has found someone, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not upset that he\u2019s found his Beloved,\u201d Ben interrupted. \u201cI\u2019m furious that he chose now to inflict himself on us. We don\u2019t have time for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, something is going on, and I think I can explain part of what\u2019s causing it. See, there\u2019s this paradox when you time travel that if you change something in the past, even something really minor, things in the future can be affected, and what we changed wasn\u2019t minor at all\u2014\u201d I was interrupted yet again, this time by a woman speaking from behind me.</p><p>\u201cAre the liches gone? Ah, yes, I see they are dead. All but the one passed out on Miranda\u2019s booth.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe have one of their heads,\u201d Fran said, holding up the still-living head by the scarf wrapped around it. \u201cWe hope to question it about David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust so.\u201d The woman, who was probably in her sixties, had one of those ageless complexions, and black hair that bore a thick white streak. She considered first Nikola, then me, her eyes widening a little when they got to me. \u201cAnother Dark One. And a weaver. One doesn\u2019t see many of you about,\u201d she told me. \u201cAre you here to help Fran and Ben? If so, I would warn against it. Such tactics never turn out as one expects.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t knit, let alone weave,\u201d I answered, feeling even more irritated. I just knew something like this would happen, Nikola.</p><p>No, you said lizards would have become our overlords. This is different.</p><p>Pfft. That\u2019s just a matter of semantics. Now what are we going to do?</p><p>\u201cNot a textile weaver,\u201d the woman said, frowning slightly. \u201cYou are a weaver of time. Benedikt, I believe you should dispose of those bodies before the public returns. Where are Hans and Karl?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn the main tent, guarding the audience there.\u201d Ben made an annoyed click of his tongue when his gaze settled on Nikola. \u201cSo long as you\u2019ve shoved yourself in where you\u2019re not wanted, you can help clean up the mess you caused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d I gave Ben a little shove. \u201cI realize that the paradox has messed stuff up, and for some reason you feel that you can be rude as hell to your father, but I\u2019m not going to stand for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIo, you do not need to defend me,\u201d Nikola said in a deceptively calm voice. I knew full well he was just as annoyed with his son as I was.</p><p>Yes, but I realize that a situation out of our control has caused him to have such animosity toward me, and thus he\u2019s not responsible for his behavior.</p><p>Like hell he isn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cAnd I will thank you to stop shoving Ben around,\u201d Fran said, pushing forward toward me. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t done anything wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrancesca,\u201d Ben said in a warning tone.</p><p>\u201cAre you implying that Nikola has done something wrong?\u201d I asked, bristling with indignation at the slur.</p> <p>It is only a slur if you allow it to be one.</p><p>Hush. I\u2019m defending your honor.</p><p>I was not aware it needed defending, he answered, but once again, I felt a sense of astonished gratitude from him that just made me want to simultaneously cry and molest him.</p><p>I prefer the molesting.</p><p>\u201cFrom what Ben and Imogen have told me, yes, he is very much in the wrong. He treated them horribly. Ben has every right to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen can just stick his attitude up his behind,\u201d I interrupted. It felt good to be the one doing it for a change.</p><p>Imogen gasped. \u201cIo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to be rude, but he started it, and to his father yet, a man who was looking forward to seeing how his children had changed since he died. Almost died. Would have died if we hadn\u2019t come through the swirly thing. So you can just stick that in your holier-than-thou pipe and smoke it!\u201d</p><p>Ben blinked at me in surprise. Fran looked like she was thinking about decking me. The two guys who got in Nikola\u2019s way moved around to stand behind Fran, one of them saying, \u201cWould you like us to put a scold\u2019s bridle on that female, Goddess Fran? The Dark One might be a bit more difficult, but if Finnvid and I were to summon some of my men, we would be able to take him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lay one finger on Io\u201d\u2014suddenly, Nikola was in front of me, blocking me from the two other men\u2014\u201cand you will not live to see the sun rise again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re ghosts,\u201d the man said with a cocky grin. \u201cWe\u2019re already dead.\u201d</p><p>Nikola\u2019s sword flashed, and the man suddenly froze, a look of horror on his face. The sword tip was at his crotch, the tip of the blade slipping easily through the fabric of his pants. \u201cThen you will be a gelded ghost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare hurt Eirik!\u201d Fran said, trying to push past the two ghosts\u2014who, I had to say, looked awfully solid and not at all how one imagines a ghost\u2014but Ben pulled her back against him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Francesca. He won\u2019t hurt your ghosts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is your woman?\u201d Nikola asked Ben, nodding toward Fran.</p><p>\u201cMy Beloved, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd his wife. We were married three weeks ago. My mother insisted.\u201d Fran still looked like she wanted to deck me, but at least she stopped looking daggers at Nikola, too.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Nikola said, blinking a couple of times. \u201cI have a daughter-by-marriage.\u201d He turned to me. \u201cMy son has married, Io. I suppose he is old enough, although I would have preferred that he discuss the matter with me, first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were dead, punkin,\u201d I said, patting his arm. \u201cThat\u2019s got to limit the amount of father-son communication possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is that,\u201d Nikola agreed, and turned back to the group in front of us. He gave the ghost a look that probably would have killed a lesser man. \u201cYou will cease making threats against my woman. I will not geld you at this time, but should you think to harm her, you will have me to answer to.\u201d</p><p>To my complete surprise, the ghost smiled, and nodded. The other one nodded, as well. \u201cI did not realize that the female was yours,\u201d the ghost said when Nikola dropped the tip of the sword. \u201cThe mother-by-marriage of the Goddess Fran must be honored.\u201d</p><p>I gawked. \u201cWait...what? No, we\u2019re not married\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hesitate to interrupt this fascinating conversation, but the mundane police should be arriving shortly if those sirens are anything to go by, and I would advise you to clean up the mess and begin the process of convincing everyone the attack by the liches was part of the show,\u201d the dark-haired woman said, giving me another odd look. \u201cSir Edward wishes for me to speak with you, child. You will come with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I think I\u2019m just going to stick with Nikola,\u201d I said, taking his hand. My stomach tightened with pleasure when his fingers wrapped around mine. \u201cGiven how rude people are to him, I think it\u2019s best that we stay together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe may join us. In fact, I believe you all should. There is a mystery here that Sir Edward insists must be unraveled,\u201d the woman said, and, turning on her heel, strode to the other end of the fair.</p><p>\u201cThat is Tallulah,\u201d Imogen said, her expression now bland as she looked from me to Nikola. \u201cShe is very wise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think, Nikola?\u201d I asked, nodding toward the receding figure of the woman.</p><p>He looked thoughtful. \u201cIt is quite evident that something is amiss with your time. If that lady can help clarify what we might do to correct things, then yes, I believe we should accompany her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBenedikt?\u201d Imogen nodded toward the retreating Tallulah, obviously asking him what they should do.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll clear up the bodies first,\u201d Ben said, stooping to collect the headless corpse in front of him. The ghosts picked up the second body, and the now-unconscious armless man. \u201cWe\u2019ll put them in Miranda\u2019s trailer. Imogen, go with...them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t say the word \u2018them\u2019 like we\u2019re giant ants about to devour the town,\u201d I said, sniffing loudly, but moving when Nikola tugged on my hand. \u201cAlthough if I was, I know who\u2019d I\u2019d squash flat first.\u201d</p><p>Ahem.</p><p>Not literally, of course. Just kind of...er...never mind.</p><p>Ten minutes later we were seated around and near a table in a travel trailer that was evidently Tallulah\u2019s home. She sat opposite Nikola and me, while Imogen, Ben, and Fran sat across from us on a cocoa-colored suede couch. The two ghosts\u2014who informed me candidly they were the pride of Valhalla sent to help Fran with some project\u2014lurked at the far end of the trailer in two spinning chairs, which they seemed greatly to enjoy.</p><p>\u201cThe police are here, but Peter has it under control. Peter is one of the owners of the GothFaire,\u201d Fran explained when she and Ben sat down. \u201cKurt and Karl got dressed up like the liches and told the police they were part of the show, so I think everything will return to normal. Or as normal as it gets around here. Oh, I guess we should do introductions.\u201d Fran gestured toward the two ghosts. \u201cThat\u2019s Eirik Redblood, and his friend Finnvid. They\u2019re Viking ghosts that I inadvertently resurrected in Sweden. The rest of Eirik\u2019s men are in Valhalla. You met Ben and me a few days ago, and this is Tallulah, who is known for her scrying and crystal-reading abilities. Sir Edward is her...er...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoyfriend,\u201d Tallulah said with complacency. Before her, she held a small black mirrored glass bowl, into which she poured a dash of water. \u201cSir Edward died some two hundred years ago, but we have not allowed that to alter our relationship. He resides in the beyond.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBeyond what?\u201d I couldn\u2019t help but ask. Don\u2019t you think I\u2019m doing really well at not even blinking at the idea of people who have ghosts as boyfriends?</p><p>If I died, would you wish to continue a relationship with me? Nikola asked.</p><p>Beneath the cover of the table, I took his hand and squeezed it. Yes.</p> <p>\u201cThe beyond is the name for that form of reality that lies between this and the next,\u201d Tallulah answered, which didn\u2019t really help me at all, but I decided that it probably wasn\u2019t the best moment to make a fuss about just what exactly she meant.</p><p>Nikola, of course, pulled out his notebook and made a few notes.</p><p>Imogen made a sound that I could\u2019ve sworn was a giggle, but when I glanced at her, her face was impassive.</p><p>\u201cOK. So your ghost friend thinks there\u2019s a mystery surrounding us? Does it have something to do with the swirly time-travel thing, or why Ben is being such a giant ball of snot to his father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is totally uncalled for,\u201d Fran said loudly.</p> <p>\u201cSwirly time-travel thing?\u201d Tallulah looked up from her bowl. \u201cDo you mean a portal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Nikola called it, but I just think of it as the swirly thing. It was almost gone by the time we came through it.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes seemed to strip away all my layers of defense, and peer straight into my soul. \u201cI believe before we go any further that we would all benefit from a recap of your experiences with the portal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, but don\u2019t expect us to have many answers. It took me forever to figure out what exactly happened, although Nikola seemed to have coped better with the whole thing. Except the part where he was convinced I was a prostitute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was understandable given the situation,\u201d he said mildly, squeezing my fingers where they rested on his thigh.</p><p>\u201cSeveral days ago I came to visit the fair with my cousin Gretl.\u201d I settled back and gave a succinct accounting of high points from the last few days, skipping over much of the craziness where I thought I was insane, and focusing on the nefarious plan by Nikola\u2019s brothers to destroy him. When I finished with us arriving back in the present, there was a profound silence for a good minute.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to think. I knew that my uncles had something to do with Papa severing ties with us, but to plan a scheme to physically harm him...it just seems so wrong.\u201d Imogen finally broke the silence, her gaze moving from Nikola to Ben. \u201cAre you sure about this, Io?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. Just as I\u2019m sure that in the present before I went through the swirly portal, you told me that your father was dead, and Ben told me he was in South America. It\u2019s clear that although lizards didn\u2019t take over the world because we altered the past, something did change, because you guys are so hostile and mean to Nikola.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Imogen said, shaking her head briefly. \u201cYour recollection of that day meshes with mine. Nothing has changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did you tell Io that I was murdered?\u201d Nikola asked her.</p><p>She pleated the material of her dress while she thought for a few seconds. \u201cI\u2014that night when you left the castle, something happened to you. But you weren\u2019t killed. At least, your body wasn\u2019t. But Rolf and Arnulf came to me the next day and said that you had ordered me from the house, and that I wasn\u2019t to return. Ever.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Nikola. I hate to keep repeating myself, but what the hell?</p><p>He shook his head. This does not make sense. \u201cAnd you believed them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at first. I tried for several days to see you, but you had locked yourself away in your study and refused to see me. At last you had to emerge from your study, and then...\u201d She rubbed her arms. \u201cThen it was like you had died inside. You were cold and cruel and said that Ben and I had betrayed you, and destroyed your heart, and that you would not tolerate vipers in your nest. You cast me out of the house, and cut off funds to Benedikt so that he had to leave university. In vain we protested that we had done nothing to betray you. You would not listen.\u201d</p> <p>Emotion was so thick in her voice it was impossible not to feel empathy. I turned to Nikola and smacked him on the arm. \u201cWhat the hell was the matter with you? Your own kids!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat cannot be,\u201d he said, frowning. \u201cI would never spurn my children in such a manner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDestroyed your heart,\u201d I repeated, scooting a little closer to him. The pain he felt at Imogen\u2019s words more than exceeded hers. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPapa never said,\u201d Imogen answered sadly. \u201cHe did not explain, nor did he answer my pleas to tell me what I had done to harm him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think it meant your late wife?\u201d I asked Nikola. \u201cBut she was dead for seven years when we met, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen we met,\u201d Nikola said slowly, looking at me with speculation. \u201cTell me, Imogen, in this past that you remember, was Io in it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIo?\u201d She considered me with a slight pucker between her brows. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. It was a very long time ago, but I do not remember Io being the woman with whom you were smitten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there was one?\u201d Nikola pounced on her words. \u201cThere was a woman present at the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d She turned to Ben. \u201cYou have a better memory than me\u2014do you remember the woman who Papa kept before that horrible day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I was away from home.\u201d Ben looked thoughtful. \u201cAlthough I do remember you writing to me and telling me that you were most pleased because he was interested in a woman again. I don\u2019t remember her name, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is possible that there are two planes of time,\u201d Nikola said, sketching something in his notebook. \u201cOne is the past that Imogen and Benedikt remember, where I severed relations with them\u2014something I find difficult to believe, but might be explained if for some reason I thought they had destroyed a woman I loved\u2014and the second plane of time, which I remember, and which Io has participated in. It is not beyond reason that the two planes touch at several points, and it is at one of those points that we moved from one time to the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying, what, that in Ben and Imogen\u2019s past, your brothers killed me, or some other woman\u201d\u2014and buster, it had better not be another woman, because then I really will feel like a tramp\u2014\u201cand in the past we lived through, they tried to kill you, instead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is possible, given that my brothers had the desire and ability to kill anyone.\u201d He tapped the end of the pencil against his chin, which just made me want to bite it. His chin, not the pencil.</p><p>Something struck me, other than the desire to molest Nikola. I turned to Imogen. \u201cYou told me that your uncles had killed your father. Why did you say that if, in your version of the past, Nikola severed ties with you himself?\u201d</p><p>She exchanged a glance with Ben. \u201cMy uncles and Papa have never been very close. And yet, at the time of his...derangement...they were not only present, but in his confidence where I was not. That was most unusual, and Benedikt and I suspected later that they had done something to Papa, cast some spell upon him, or corrupted his love for us. We had no proof, but it could not be a coincidence that they were present to poison his mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not recall any such thing,\u201d Nikola said, his gaze blind as he sorted through his memories. \u201cThey made me an unwelcome visit the day that Io insisted I accompany her through the portal, but we did not spend enough time together for either of them to have any effect on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I got you away from them so fast,\u201d I said with a sense of pride that I felt was wholly warranted. \u201cWhy did they come to visit you in the first place?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI couldn\u2019t make any sense of out either of them. Rolf babbled about how someone near me meant ill for me, and Arnulf simply groveled in his usual manner, and echoed Rolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever it was, you can bet it was part of their plan to knock you off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly.\u201d Nikola looked somewhat pensive. \u201cFrom my experiences with them, however, I would find it difficult to believe that they had the drive to conduct such a heinous act.\u201d</p><p>I let that supposition go, knowing Nikola well enough to understand that I wasn\u2019t going to convince him of his brothers\u2019 betrayal without solid proof. \u201cOK, so it seems like it\u2019s pretty clear that both pasts were real, but since you\u2019re here now, that means your past is the right past, so the one where you were a jerk to your kids didn\u2019t happen, and thus, they can stop being pissed at you and can be grateful you\u2019re alive and well and here to be a daddy to them again.\u201d I sniffled a little with happiness. \u201cIt\u2019s like a deranged Hallmark movie. Oh my god, Nikola!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I am not a god, although if it pleases you to think so about me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, silly.\u201d I whumped him on the arm. \u201cWhat if there\u2019s another you? The one that Ben and Imogen know? What if there\u2019s a second you who is living in Brazil hitting on all the tanned, bikini-clad women?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be impossible,\u201d he said, putting away his notebook.</p><p>\u201cNo, impossible is traveling back in time three centuries and falling for a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Nikola who spurned his children did so at the loss of his heart. My heart is very much in place, as are you. Therefore, that is the past that is negated, and my past is, as you point out, the valid one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we don\u2019t know for certain what else we might have affected,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThe only thing that changed concerned my existence, and if that was devoted solely to the pursuit of pleasure and nothing else, then it was trivial at best. I doubt if the shift of trivial to nonexistent\u2014in that context, at least\u2014would affect any great changes on the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose that\u2019s true,\u201d I said slowly.</p><p>Imogen gave a stifled sort of sob, then flung herself on Nikola, murmuring, \u201cPapa! Oh, Papa, how I\u2019ve missed you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was, as I said, very much a Hallmark moment, and although Ben seemed to harbor some less than Precious Moments feelings, he did at least let Nikola hug him, and answered his father\u2019s questions about his life readily enough.</p><p>\u201cOnce again I find myself in a position of interrupting,\u201d Tallulah said in a neutral voice that nonetheless had everyone retaking their seats. \u201cBut this is only part of the mystery of which Sir Edward speaks.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m so glad we got that straightened out, I told Nikola, leaning into his side and enjoying the feeling of his hand on my thigh. I hated the way they were treating you. What do you think of how they turned out?</p> <p>They are intelligent and charming, as I knew they would be, he said with lofty disregard of the fact that a few minutes before he was distressed by their behavior. My wife always said that they took after me.</p><p>Man, what an ego. If I didn\u2019t think you were smart and sexy as hell, I\u2019d be all over you for that.</p><p>I know you wish to seduce me, he said with what was meant to be a rebuke, but plainly wasn\u2019t in that he was at that exact moment thinking of the most erotic things that could be done to the human body with a tongue and two hands, but I feel compelled to listen to this woman. She appears to have interesting insights.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not something to do with David, is it?\u201d Fran asked, trying to see into the bowl of water. \u201cYou said last week that you couldn\u2019t see anything about how he was or even where he was. Has something changed with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Tallulah said, somewhat hesitantly. She held her gaze on the bowl as she tipped and rotated it slowly, making the water lap lazily from side to side. \u201cAt least, not in the sense you mean. Sir Edward claims that Nikola\u2019s presence here foretells violence to come, and that it might spill over to your concerns if left unchecked.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn what way?\u201d Nikola asked, his curiosity temporarily overriding his smutty thoughts.</p><p>\u201cAnd what sort of violence?\u201d I asked, worried that, by bringing him to the present, we\u2019d set in motion a horrible war or something similar.</p><p>\u201cIt is an unbalance.\u201d Tallulah set down her bowl and gave us both a frown. \u201cThe shifting of the balance will cause great pain for many if it is not redressed. You are a weaver, Iolanthe Tennyson. Time that you should have woven together to form a barrier has been unmade. Beyond that, I cannot see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said in a voice that was more a horrified squeak than anything else. \u201cYou\u2019re saying that this unbalanced violence is my fault? Is it because I went through the swirly portal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a weaver,\u201d she repeated, just like that was supposed to make things clearer. \u201cYou can summon and dismiss portals in time. You have stated that you traveled through a portal you summoned, but you did not state whether or not you closed it so that no others could use it as you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014but\u2014\u201d I stopped, turning to Nikola as his mind was suddenly filled with speculation and worry.</p> <p>\u201cDo you mean to say that someone else has used the portal that we used?\u201d Nikola asked, his muscles tense.</p><p>\u201cHas already, or may in the future, yes,\u201d Tallulah answered, her eyes grave as they watched me. \u201cDid you close the portal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! That is, I don\u2019t know. Maybe I did. I didn\u2019t even know there were such people as weavers, not that I\u2019m sure I am one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have never seen a portal in the Zauberwald except when the demon lord cursed me,\u201d Nikola said, his fingers stroking along the top of my hand. \u201cI had no idea such people existed, either, but it would explain why the portal was present when you were there, but missing when you were not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you close it?\u201d Ben asked me, but looking at his father.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea. I guess not, if something has to be done to close it. It was really faded when we last saw it. Nikola thought it was depleted. Is that the same thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Tallulah said. \u201cA portal is just that, an access point to somewhere or some other time. It has no power itself, but draws on those who master it. There are few beings who can do so\u2014demon lords, as Nikola mentioned, Guardians, and of course weavers. If you have little experience controlling it, then it is likely that it would have run out of power after you used it, and thus you would require a period of rest before you could use it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of like charging up its batteries?\u201d I asked, trying to get a grip on the whole idea that I was a magic-door-in-time wrangler.</p> <p>\u201cIf you like, although as I said, the portal itself does not have the power; you do. Do I take it that you suspect someone other than you has used the portal?\u201d</p><p>That last question was addressed to Nikola, who answered in an equally somber voice, \u201cI believe so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd do you know who that person might be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He looked at me, and I felt a sudden spike of fear in my gut when I felt the distress that gripped him. \u201cI thought I saw one of my brothers earlier while we were in town.\u201d</p><p>The fear grew until I felt sick. \u201cNo! Oh, for the love of the four and twenty virgins, if they saw us use the swirly portal\u2014but how could they use it, as well, if we ran it out of juice? Or rather, I ran out of portal-using juice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps it hadn\u2019t yet run out of energy,\u201d Nikola said, his fingers drawing random symbols on the table. \u201cIf they saw us disappear into it\u2014or even if they concluded what happened by our absence and the presence of the portal\u2014then they might have used it before we resumed our awareness here in your time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, we were out for a bit. It was nighttime when we went through, and afternoon when we came to here. Holy hairy pickles, Batman, your murderous half brothers are running around the present doing who knows what horrible things. What if they still want to kill you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr you,\u201d he said, pulling me closer. \u201cSince evidently they did that in the alternate past.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him, speechless with horror.</p><p>What on earth had I done?</p><p>July 16 (still, yes)</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know for certain that my uncles used the portal after you,\u201d Ben pointed out. \u201cBut at least you can keep them from killing Io easily enough. You just have to complete the Joining, and then Io will be a proper Beloved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you we\u2019ve already hooked up.\u201d I gave Ben a look that should have told him that I wasn\u2019t up to hearing snide comments about my relationship with Nikola. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to belabor the point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelabor?\u201d Nikola looked puzzled.</p><p>\u201cThe word \u2018Beloved,\u2019 it\u2019s not what you think,\u201d Fran told me with a tight little smile. \u201cThe vampires\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDark Ones,\u201d Ben and Nikola said in chorus.</p><p>\u201c\u2014have a special relationship with one woman, who they call their Beloved. That\u2019s a capital B Beloved. It\u2019s like a title. Anyway, Beloveds are special because they can redeem the soul of the vamp\u2014Dark Ones, but to do that, they have to go through seven steps called Joining. I don\u2019t really remember exactly what the steps are, because Ben and I did part of them several years ago, when I was only sixteen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need to bore them with that,\u201d Ben said quickly, giving her a look that made her laugh.</p><p>\u201cSixteen?\u201d Nikola\u2019s eyebrows rose. \u201cThat is too young. Women of sixteen do not yet know their own minds. I taught you to respect women better than that, Benedikt.\u201d</p><p>To my great enjoyment, Ben looked abashed. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that\u2014yes, Francesca was only sixteen when we met, but we spent several years apart before we\u2014before we decided to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou dug yourself into that hole,\u201d Fran said with another laugh. \u201cAnd no, I\u2019m not going to help you get out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was not until a few months ago that the Former Virgin Goddess Fran allowed the Dark One to engage in bedsport,\u201d the ghost named Eirik said helpfully. \u201cWe guarded her most diligently until she insisted that we allow her to enjoy his manroot. She sought much advice from us on how to please him, however, and what to do should he decide he preferred sheep to her.\u201d</p><p>Fran sighed heavily. \u201cJust an FYI\u2014don\u2019t ever ask them for advice. But we\u2019ve strayed from the point. Imogen, do you remember what the steps are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. The first step is a marking, followed by protection from afar, an exchange of...er...fluids, usually a kiss. Then the Dark One entrusts the Beloved with his life, by giving her a means to destroy him, which then leads to...well, an intimate situation...after which the Beloved helps him overcome his darker self, and that leads to a blood exchange. The last step isn\u2019t really a step, it\u2019s more of a coup de gr\u00e2ce, and that\u2019s where she sacrifices herself to save him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have got to be kidding!\u201d I said, aghast.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cThose are the seven steps. If Benedikt says you smell like a Beloved, then you must have completed the majority of them. And yet not all, because Papa does not have his soul back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA sacrifice? What sort of sacrifice? Like death sort of sacrifice?\u201d I pointed at Fran. \u201cShe\u2019s still alive. How can you sacrifice yourself and live? I don\u2019t want to be a sacrifice! I just want to live with Nikola and do all the things he\u2019s almost constantly thinking about doing, and several that I have thought up which I haven\u2019t yet let him see, and I can\u2019t possibly do that if I\u2019m dead. Besides, the whole point is to let me live as long as he does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down, it\u2019s not as dire as it sounds,\u201d Fran said, giving me a genuine smile this time. \u201cThe sacrifice part is very open to interpretation. From what the other Beloveds said when we met up while we were in Vienna last week, it depends on the couple. It could be something as simple as giving up your job and family and life at home to live with your vampire, or something with a bit more oomph to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d I asked. I don\u2019t mind giving up my job, because I don\u2019t have one. And I don\u2019t have close family, so that wouldn\u2019t be an issue, either. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell...one of the Beloveds threw herself in front of her vampire when someone was about to stake him, and she got stabbed instead. Another one got her throat cut, but that was a really special circumstance because I heard that she got turned, and lost her soul. But then she got it back, so it ended up OK.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEek,\u201d I said faintly, clutching Nikola\u2019s arm. I\u2019m sorry if this is going to sound selfish and uncaring, but I don\u2019t want to be stabbed or have my throat cut. Or lose my soul!</p><p>\u201cHow do you know this?\u201d Nikola asked Ben, looking up from where he was\u2014naturally\u2014taking notes. \u201cThis is not something I taught you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. Actually...\u201d Ben cleared his throat. \u201cI learned it after you severed ties with us. I turned to the Moravian Council for help, and they gave me quite a bit more information than you ever did. I used to think you deliberately withheld the information from us in an attempt to put us at a disadvantage, but with this new insight into the past, I\u2019m willing to admit that you didn\u2019t intend that to be the result.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have never heard of this Beloved business, or the Joining needed to create one.\u201d He looked at me. \u201cHindsight leads me to believe that I should have contacted the Moravian Society earlier, Io. I should not have let the fact that they knew things I had not yet determined for myself sway me from contacting them. I have nothing but my pride to blame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know better,\u201d I reassured him, leaning in to give him a quick kiss. \u201cNo one told you how to be a vampire after the demon lord made you one, so you couldn\u2019t have known all the rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have contacted them,\u201d he repeated. \u201cI may prefer to discover knowledge for myself, but I should have made an exception in this situation. However, that is now moot. This Beloved that you speak of, she has her soul, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Fran said, smiling at Ben. \u201cI have to say, it\u2019s kind of romantic that your dad had to come into the future to find his one true love.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, we\u2019re not in love,\u201d I said quickly, a little embarrassed that everyone should think we were a madly romantic couple. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m very fond of Nikola, and we enjoy being together, and yes, I did say that I wouldn\u2019t mind spending however long with him because he\u2019s really fascinating, but we\u2019re not in love. Just kind of...in fond. Right, Nikola?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall draft a letter to the council immediately, demanding that they tell me everything that they told my son,\u201d Nikola said to himself as he made another note.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d I waved toward Nikola.</p><p>Fran turned to her husband. \u201cDidn\u2019t you tell me that all vamps are madly in love with their Beloveds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Io smells like a Beloved?\u201d</p> <p>I straightened up. \u201cI beg your pardon!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen that means he has to be in love with her,\u201d Fran said, gesturing toward me. \u201cSo why isn\u2019t your dad getting with the program?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s always been a little...different,\u201d Ben said with obvious apology.</p><p>\u201cHey! There\u2019s nothing wrong with your dad. He just likes to keep track of important stuff and things he\u2019s curious about. Nikola, tell your kid that you\u2019re not weird just because you\u2019re not in love with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd perhaps I\u2019ll conduct some research into the phenomenon of losing and regaining a soul\u2014hmm? Why are you pinching me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen thinks you\u2019re defective or something because you\u2019re not in love with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does?\u201d Nikola eyed his son. \u201cI tried to love your mother, but was unable to do so despite the fact that she was quite worthy of that emotion. It is no surprise that I am unable to do likewise for Io.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama was not your Beloved,\u201d Imogen said, giving me a long look. \u201cEvidently Io is.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd that should make a difference?\u201d Nikola asked them.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Fran answered.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d He considered me. Would you like me to be in love with you, sweetling?</p><p>No! Of course not! No, unless...you know...you wanted to be. I don\u2019t want you to feel like you have to pretend you\u2019re in love with me, because that\u2019s not the sort of relationship we have.</p><p>Exactly what do we have? In reference to our relationship, that is?</p><p>Well...we like each other a lot.</p><p>Yes, we do.</p><p>And of course, the sex is spectacular.</p><p>Most gratifyingly so, yes.</p><p>And we want to spend time together. I mean, I like being with you, and you said you like being with me, so that\u2019s what we have.</p><p>With no love?</p><p>No. Er...not unless you wanted it. Do you?</p><p>I don\u2019t know. Do you?</p><p>Everyone is staring at us. I cleared my throat. I think this is going to be one of those discussions that we\u2019ll have to have another time.</p><p>As you like. He turned back to the others. \u201cIo is thinking over whether or not she wishes for us to be in love. Until she makes up her mind, we should go on with what advice this kind lady has for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wondered if anyone was going to remember me,\u201d Tallulah said with a private smile. \u201cIt is Sir Edward who offers the advice, and that is this: Find the man who has used the portal. Find him as quickly as you can, and do what you must to restore balance where you have brought unbalance. For if you do not...\u201d</p><p>Her voice trailed off dramatically, leaving me with a shiver down my back and arms. Once again, I leaned into Nikola for comfort.</p><p>\u201cIf we do not?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>Her gaze moved along each of us, ending on me. \u201cIf you do not, countless lives will be sacrificed.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until almost an hour later that we were able to gather\u2014\u201cwe\u201d being Imogen, Ben, Fran, and Nikola and me\u2014in Imogen\u2019s trailer. She had insisted that we meet Peter Sauber, who was one of the two owners of the fair, and explained to him that Nikola was her long-lost father.</p><p>\u201cCousin!\u201d I had said quickly, flashing a very toothy smile to Imogen before turning it on the balding, slightly worried-looking man. \u201cNikola is Imogen\u2019s cousin. He couldn\u2019t be her father because he barely looks ten years older than her. He\u2019s her cousin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Io,\u201d Imogen said, patting my hand. \u201cPeter knows about Ben and me. What we are, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I pursed my lips as I examined the man in question. \u201cSorry. Are you a vamp, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, his forehead wrinkling a little. \u201cI\u2019m a magician. It\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, Baron. I understood that you were in South America recently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that was the wrong past,\u201d I corrected him, smiling at Nikola just because he was so incredibly handsome, it took every ounce of strength I possessed to keep from flinging myself on him.</p><p>You are more than welcome to\u2014</p><p>Stop right there, or I will have no resistance whatsoever.</p><p>Nikola laughed in my head.</p><p>\u201cThe wrong...no, don\u2019t tell me. There\u2019s enough going on without trying to figure that out.\u201d</p><p>After meeting a few more people, we finally ended up in Imogen\u2019s pretty trailer, the inside of which was done in shades of olive and taupe.</p><p>Imogen, Fran, and I sat together on a gently curved taupe and olive polka-dot sofa, while Ben and his father stood at the far end of the trailer, their heads together as they discussed something. It made my heart happy to see Nikola reunited with his son, especially since it was obvious they were having such an emotionally intense conversation.</p><p>\u201cIo, I think I owe you an apology,\u201d Fran said, drawing my attention back.</p><p>\u201cAbout being so mean to Nikola? I suppose it\u2019s understandable, although really, even if Nikola had been from the past you remembered, he\u2019s still Ben\u2019s daddy, and thus due a little respect\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Fran said, holding up a hand to stop me. \u201cI meant about mentioning you guys being in love. I didn\u2019t realize that it was possible for a vamp and his Beloved not to be in love, and I think I made you very uncomfortable. I\u2019m very sorry if I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, that.\u201d I waved a hand like it didn\u2019t mean anything. \u201cI think it\u2019s because Nikola and I are so much more matu\u2014er\u2014settled in our ways. We\u2019re not young, like you and Ben are. Or rather just you. Not that you\u2019re an infant, but...oh, you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d She laughed. \u201cI\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t offend you. And I\u2019m really glad that you found Nikola, no matter how it came about, or what form the relationship takes. It\u2019s just nice to see another Dark One who\u2019s found his other half.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but look at Nikola, my gaze caressing him in a manner that I knew was going to spell trouble if I let it continue. I swear, my mouth started watering just from looking at him with his head next to Ben\u2019s as they talked quietly.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that cute?\u201d I said softly, nodding toward them. \u201cSeeing them together like that, I feel like the Grinch when his heart grows so many sizes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think they\u2019re talking about?\u201d Fran asked Imogen.</p><p>She smiled, her eyes a bit bright with tears of happiness. \u201cI don\u2019t know, and I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m just so pleased to have Papa back, the Papa I remember from my youth. He was always such a loving man...until that day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich didn\u2019t happen anymore,\u201d I pointed out, feeling my own eyes getting misty, as well. \u201cI bet they\u2019re talking about something deep and important. I bet Nikola\u2019s telling Ben how proud he is of him, and how much he\u2019s missed him, and maybe even is offering fatherly advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Imogen said, sniffling happily.</p><p>What are you talking to Ben about? I couldn\u2019t help but ask. Something sweet and tender and touching?</p><p>Yes. Nikola glanced my way. I asked Benedikt if he often caught his pubic hair on the fastening device of these breeches. He said that is what Jockeys are for. What is a Jockey? I do not wish to appear ignorant in front of my son. Is it something you stuff down the front of the breeches to protect your genitals? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I burst into laughter, unable to keep the mirth contained. \u201cOh, yes, they\u2019re having a deep and important conversation.\u201d</p><p>The two men, evidently through with said discussion, sat down opposite us. \u201cYou said you wished to help us locate Rolf?\u201d Nikola asked, shooting me a look that let me know he could read my thoughts of just how I\u2019d protect his pubic hair from undue zipper pinching.</p><p>\u201cWe would be happy to help you, but there\u2019s a situation that has been growing steadily worse, culminating in the attack you saw earlier,\u201d Ben answered, leaning back in one of Imogen\u2019s curved easy chairs. \u201cThe liches were sent by an Ilargi, a lichmaster who is also working with a group experimenting on therions and now Dark Ones. The man who is the father of Francesca\u2019s half sister, Petra, is responsible for the kidnapping of my blood brother David.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou have a blood brother?\u201d Nikola asked, a little startled.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Ben\u2019s eyes were dark with anger. \u201cHe is a therion, a leo of his pride, and he was helping me when he was taken. We\u2019ve tried for three months to locate where de Marco\u2014the lichmaster\u2014has taken him, but every time we get close to finding where they\u2019re holding David, they move him. Fran\u2019s ghosts have assisted us, as well as those therions who haven\u2019t gone into hiding to protect themselves, but we don\u2019t have much information to go on.\u201d</p><p>What\u2019s a therion?</p><p>I don\u2019t know. He thought for a moment. The word means dangerous animal in Greek. Perhaps...yes, I believe he\u2019s speaking about a man who has an animal spirit. I read of such things, but I did not know if it was the wild imaginings of the author or a genuine being.</p><p>\u201cSo, there are animal spirit dudes who this lich guy is experimenting on?\u201d I asked, not minding if I was the one who looked ignorant.</p> <p>\u201cAnimal spirit...ah. Therions are shape-shifters,\u201d Ben explained. \u201cDavid\u2019s animal form is that of an Asiatic lion. His pride, the group of therions that he leads, are all also lion shifters. The lichmaster is intent on building an army of therions he can control.\u201d His gaze shifted to Nikola. \u201cAnd lately, he\u2019s wanted to try to control Dark Ones, as well, hence his interest in capturing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is not going to happen,\u201d Fran said, moving over to sit on the arm of his chair, one hand tangled in his hair as she leaned into him.</p><p>Nikola watched them with interest for a few seconds before looking at me, one eyebrow cocked. I\u2019m not as young as she is, I pointed out. I don\u2019t perch on arms of chairs well. Not to mention that it\u2019s undignified.</p><p>I do not think so.</p><p>Well, I do. Also, I\u2019m not a young thing who can\u2019t keep her hands off of you. I am, as you so obnoxiously pointed out, mature. I can sit in the same room with you without feeling the need to maul you, or touch your hair, or kiss you.</p><p>All of that sounds rather nice, actually.</p> <p>Well, it can just sound nice. I\u2019m not going to pretend I\u2019m a giddy twenty-something madly in love with you. Besides, my behind is bigger than hers and needs a more substantial platform.</p><p>Your bottom is lovely, and just the size it should be. It gives me great pleasure. I enjoy looking at it and stroking it. I also wish to bite it, but I suspect you might find that objectionable, so I am content to keep that desire to myself until such time as you will let me do so.</p><p>\u201cOh, screw it,\u201d I said, and took three steps to plop myself down on Nikola\u2019s lap, wrapping one arm around him, and glaring at Imogen when she giggled. \u201cRight, so those scythe guys were trying to grab you for their lich boss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He\u2019s made an attempt to kidnap Ben before, right after we were married.\u201d Fran looked worried. \u201cWe were close to finding the whereabouts of David, and several of the therions de Marco has turned feral, for lack of a better word, caught us, and we had to run for our lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTallulah said that Uncle Rolf might be tied in with the David situation,\u201d Imogen said, her expression turning serious. \u201cBut I do not see how that can be. He is mortal, not a therion, and not a Dark One. Surely the lichmaster would have no interest in him, or vice versa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see no reason why this lichmaster would have an interest in Rolf,\u201d Nikola agreed, mentally considering and discarding various possibilities.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you can\u2019t, but I can,\u201d I said, suddenly feeling chilled. I put my other arm around him, my stomach sick at the thought.</p><p>I can\u2019t breathe if you clutch my head to your breasts like this.</p> <p>You don\u2019t need to breathe. You\u2019re a vampire. And I want to keep you safe.</p><p>Once again, gratitude and astonishment filled him as he gently pried my arms from around his head. As do I with you, sweetling, but we have nothing to fear from Rolf. I am immortal, and it seems we are close to making you so, as well.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Imogen asked, stark white stress lines appearing around her mouth as she tightened her lips.</p><p>\u201cI mean what if Rolf decided he needed some help getting rid of Nikola? He wanted him dead in the past; who\u2019s to say he doesn\u2019t want him dead now, too? Maybe that\u2019s why he followed us here. Maybe he is seeing this as a way of settling a score, or satisfying a need to destroy, or who knows what? If he wanted Nikola dead, then who better to go to than a vampire-torturing lichmaster with a bunch of rabid werewolves at his command?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTherions, not werewolves,\u201d Ben corrected automatically, but I saw the way he glanced at Fran. He suddenly looked just as worried as I felt.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see how Rolf would know about de Marco, though,\u201d Fran said slowly.</p><p>\u201cBut is it likely that he would be able to find information about this lich dude? That\u2019s the only issue I see. I mean, he\u2019s not a vampire like you are, Nikola.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but he discovered what happened to me shortly after I was cursed,\u201d Nikola mused. \u201cHe\u2019s very good at uncovering secrets, and although I still do not understand why he would be anxious to see me dead, I will admit that he possesses the skills and intelligence to ferret out any assistance there is to be had. It is logical to conclude that he will strive to do so. We must prepare for the worst, and hope that our expectations of Rolf\u2019s resourcefulness are inflated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m confused,\u201d Imogen said, looking exactly that. \u201cIt would be horrible for de Marco to kidnap Papa, just as it would be horrible if he were to get Ben, or any Dark One for that matter. But how is that unbalancing the present, as Tallulah said? How will this mean the deaths of many people?\u201d</p><p>Nikola stilled as he read my thoughts, shaking his head in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, I do think he could do that. I was simply appalled because of the realization that the son of my mother could do something so heinous. She would have died of shame had she known what a man he turned out to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth of them. Remember your other brother was in on the plan to kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s possible?\u201d Fran asked, but before we could answer, the door was thrown open and the two ghosts came in.</p><p>\u201cGoddess Fran,\u201d the one named Eirik said, bowing to Fran. \u201cDark One. Dark One. Mother-by-marriage of the Goddess Fran. Imogen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather of Imogen,\u201d the second ghost said, bowing even lower to Nikola. \u201cI am Finnvid, warrior of Valhalla, beloved of ale wenches, slaughterer of many Huns and Visigoths. Your daughter, Imogen, and I have spent many nights swiving. She is very good at it, and I, as a warrior and one who is beloved by the ale wenches I mentioned earlier, bring her much pleasure in bedsport. For that reason, and because I do not wish to return to Valhalla and be left to swive the ale wenches who seek my bed so frequently, I seek permission from you to wed Imogen, and provide her with countless nights of enjoyment beneath me. We will name our first son in your honor, and he will be strong and ready to fight for you should you need his sword arm. Our daughters will be comely and make excellent wives. We will name one of them after Imogen\u2019s mother, and if you like, one after your woman, although I do not understand how a name can have only vowels and no consonants. We will put some consonants in the daughter\u2019s name.\u201d</p><p>Finnvid bowed again, then waited, clearly leaving the conversational ball in Nikola\u2019s court.</p><p>\u201cOh, Finnvid,\u201d Imogen said in a little exasperation. \u201cI told you that we\u2019d wait a bit to talk to Papa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI waited,\u201d Finnvid protested.</p><p>\u201cYou wish to wed a ghost?\u201d Nikola finally asked, looking hard at Imogen.</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d She made a vague gesture. \u201cI\u2019m not getting any younger, and...er...he\u2019s right, we do hit it off quite well, although I don\u2019t think he needed to mention the ale wenches quite so much. So, yes, I think I\u2019d like to marry him, and that way, I won\u2019t be de trop when Benedikt and Fran are around, and now, of course, you and Io. You don\u2019t mind, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have consonants in my name,\u201d I protested. \u201cI just don\u2019t use them very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do not use them at all,\u201d Nikola corrected. \u201cI spoke to you about that, but you took offense and struck me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not hit you! I barely touched you. And besides, you deserved it, you were being obnoxious about my name, not to mention you kept sneaking peeks at my boobs.\u201d I stopped, and cleared my throat. \u201cBut that\u2019s not here or there. You go right ahead and do your fatherly thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat fatherly thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever it is fathers do when a Viking ghost asks to marry their daughter.\u201d Nikola just stared blankly at me. I slapped my hands on my thighs. \u201cWell, how do I know what that is? I\u2019m not a father!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey wish to name a child after you. I believe that involves you in the marriage negotiations,\u201d he countered.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, you don\u2019t. You\u2019re not getting me involved in whatever bizarro historical thing dads did in your day. Dowries, wasn\u2019t that it? Didn\u2019t you dower your daughters when they got married?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d I looked at him in surprise.</p><p>\u201cI only have one daughter, and she\u2019s never been married, so no, I have not dowered my daughters.\u201d</p> <p>I smacked him on the arm. \u201cYou know what I meant, Mr. Literal.\u201d</p><p>He examined Finnvid, who straightened up and clearly tried to look like suitable marriage material. \u201cTwo sons,\u201d Nikola finally said.</p><p>Imogen sighed, and rose, moving over to a counter to plug in an electric teakettle.</p><p>\u201cTwo?\u201d Finnvid asked.</p><p>\u201cYou will name one son after me, and one after my father. The naming of daughters I leave to Imogen, although it would please me to see one named after Io. With more consonants in the name, obviously.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou are beyond obnoxious,\u201d I told Nikola, getting off his lap and going toward the back of the trailer. \u201cImogen, I take it you have a bathroom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s just before the door to my bedroom.\u201d</p><p>I tended a little business, and returned to find Imogen pouring out cups of tea for herself, Fran, and me. The gentlemen had disappeared.</p><p>Is everything all right? I asked Nikola, worried at his absence.</p><p>Yes. The ghosts insist we celebrate the betrothal of Imogen with ale, which Benedikt says can be found in something called a food truck. What is a food truck?</p><p>It\u2019s a truck with food. I thought we were going to tackle the issue of your brother?</p> <p>We will shortly, but first I must negotiate the terms of the marriage settlement with the Viking.</p><p>Are you really OK with the idea of having a ghost for a son-in-law? I mean, can they even have children?</p><p>I am promised two grandsons and as many granddaughters, so I assume the answer is yes.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d I told Imogen, toasting her with my cup of tea. \u201cI hope you both will be very happy. And...er...don\u2019t pay any attention to that stuff about naming children after your dad or me. Although obviously, if you wanted to name a kid after your father, that\u2019s fine. I didn\u2019t know\u2014well, it\u2019s not like I even knew ghosts existed, let alone could be tangible and stuff like that\u2014but I didn\u2019t know that ghosts could have children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt depends on the ghost, evidently,\u201d Fran said, sipping her tea. \u201cMine were raised by means of the Vikingah\u00e4rta, an amulet which belongs to Loki, a big pain-in-the-patootie Norse god, so those ghosts are more substantial than your run-of-the-mill spirits, or so I gather. They can stay corporeal indefinitely.\u201d</p><p>I set down my cup. \u201cI just don\u2019t know that I\u2019m going to get used to this sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK. I know just how you feel,\u201d Fran said, patting my hand. She still wore her gloves, I noticed. She saw me looking at them, and grimaced. \u201cI\u2019m a psychometrist. I feel emotions and things like that by touching objects.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? That\u2019s kind of neat.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is if you\u2019re not the one who has to deal with it,\u201d she said with another grimace. \u201cIt\u2019s not nearly as handy as someone who can summon a time-traveling portal. You don\u2019t happen to have a screwdriver, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA screwdriver?\u201d I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you know, like the Doctor?\u201d She laughed when I continued to stare at her. \u201cNever mind, it was just a little joke. I\u2019ve been watching too much of the BBC. Did you really freak out when you met Ben\u2019s dad?\u201d</p><p>I sighed heavily. \u201cMostly. And a lot of it was his fault. I thought I was going crazy because I could hear his thoughts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine that was quite unnerving if you didn\u2019t realize you were being marked,\u201d Imogen said. \u201cHow exactly did you meet Papa?\u201d</p><p>I settled back and went over the last few days in more details than I had at Tallulah\u2019s trailer, glossing over the parts where I couldn\u2019t keep my hands off Nikola. By the time I\u2019d gotten to the smutty FedEx woman, the men returned, looking extremely pleased with themselves. The Vikings smelled of ale and staggered in after Nikola and Ben, who just looked dark, dangerous, and oh-so-sexy. At least Nikola did.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the game plan?\u201d I asked when everyone was settled again. Nikola and I had possession of Imogen\u2019s couch, which allowed me to surreptitiously press my leg against his in a way that made me very happy. Ben took up his spot on the chair, with Fran perched next to him. Imogen sat on a small ottoman next to Finnvid, and the other ghost, Eirik, murmured something about needing to stretch his back, so he lay down in the aisle and promptly fell asleep.</p><p>\u201cAs I see it, we have two problems,\u201d Fran said, combing her fingers through Ben\u2019s hair. \u201cThe first is the situation with David, but I don\u2019t expect that to be solved immediately unless we get a whole lot luckier than we have been in the last three months. The second is to find Ben\u2019s wicked uncle Rafe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRalph,\u201d I said, frowning a little and wondering how we were going to find him.</p><p>\u201cRolf,\u201d Nikola corrected.</p><p>\u201cAnd stop him from meeting with your lichmaster, and thus destroying every vampire he can find in a three-hundred-year span,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Fran shrieked, making Ben jerk away and give her a pained look. \u201cSorry, Ben, didn\u2019t mean to shout in your ear. What did you mean destroy every vampire in three hundred years? How can Ben\u2019s uncle do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he could use the portal to zip around time and capture vampires, he could do an unimaginable amount of damage,\u201d I explained.</p><p>\u201cSweet mother of reason,\u201d Fran said, looking horrified. \u201cIs that what you were about to mention earlier? I can\u2019t believe\u2014it couldn\u2019t be possible\u2014no, surely Rolf wouldn\u2019t go in for wholesale genocide. Would he?\u201d</p><p>She asked the question of Nikola, but it was Ben who answered. \u201cHe might well do exactly that.\u201d His gaze turned to his father. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to ask you this, but given the circumstances...well, that\u2019s all changed now. Who do you think engaged the demon lord who turned you?\u201d</p><p>Nikola was silent for a moment or two, his mind whirring with speculation about the question. \u201cI\u2019ve never known for certain,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cI\u2019ve had a suspicion, but the demon lord refused to tell me, and I was in no fit state to challenge him on the question. You appear to be implying that my brothers had something to do with it. Do you have any proof?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ben admitted. \u201cBut it seems to me that they are the ones who stood to benefit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom Nikola being made a Dark One?\u201d I patted Nikola\u2019s leg. \u201cWhy? It just makes him immortal. If they wanted his position or inheritance, then they wouldn\u2019t have wanted him living forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have long tried to understand our uncles\u2019 reasoning, but we can\u2019t. It just doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d Imogen said. \u201cBen says it is because we don\u2019t know all the truth of what happened at that time, that there were unseen forces at work, but he has always been a little prone to conspiracy theories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have not!\u201d Ben snorted, outraged.</p><p>Imogen smiled a tolerant smile.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense at all. My brothers couldn\u2019t inherit Andras Castle,\u201d Nikola said thoughtfully. \u201cThey were not sons of my father, and thus they had no claim on the castle. That will pass to Benedikt when I die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can\u2019t? Well, crap.\u201d I kicked my toe at nothing. \u201cThere goes my brilliant explanation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Imogen and I weren\u2019t born when you were changed into a Dark One. Perhaps they thought they could take control of the castle and your fortune if you were dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the castle,\u201d Nikola repeated, his mind still going over all the possibilities. \u201cBut my fortune...yes, that I could see them gaining if I had no descendants. It is, however, merely speculation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose we can\u2019t damn them based on just the fact that it makes perfect sense.\u201d I sighed sadly. \u201cOh well. Maybe we can beat the truth out of them once we catch them.\u201d</p><p>Nikola looked at me as if he\u2019d never seen me. \u201cBeat it out of them? You expect me to beat my own brothers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, not torture them, obviously, but surely a little arm-twisting to admit the truth wouldn\u2019t be out of the question. Or wait, can you just, you know, do a mind thing on them to make them admit the truth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMind thing?\u201d</p><p>I giggled at the expression on Nikola\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, Io, they can\u2019t do that,\u201d Fran said. \u201cI should know, I\u2019ve asked Ben to do it often enough, but he insists they can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we can\u2019t,\u201d Ben said firmly, giving her a stern look that just made her kiss his forehead.</p><p>You really seem to have gotten cheated. You can\u2019t turn into a bat or a wolf, you can\u2019t do the brain thing on people and make them your unwilling slaves, and you can\u2019t seduce women with your eyes.</p><p>Who said I can\u2019t?</p><p>He gave me a come-hither look that just about had me pouncing on him. All right, I take it back, you can seduce with your eyes. But you\u2019d better not be trying that on anyone else, or you\u2019ll find yourself with one pissed-off almost-Beloved on your hands.</p><p>You are a very violent woman. I didn\u2019t not realize this at first.</p><p>I am not! I\u2019m a pacifist! I don\u2019t believe in guns, or the death penalty, or wars, or stuff like that.</p><p>You are many things, sweetling, but you are not a pacifist.</p><p>\u201cThe question is,\u201d Imogen said, leaning against her ghost while I glared at her father. \u201cHow are we to find Uncle Rolf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs to that, I believe I have an idea,\u201d Nikola said, pulling out his notebook.</p><p>Approximately an hour and a half later, I emerged from a small shop, a triumphant\u2014if somewhat dazed\u2014smile on my face.</p><p>\u201cDid he buy the coins?\u201d Nikola asked as I got into the small minivan that we\u2019d rented a short while before. \u201cWas your passport enough documentation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he mention Uncle Rolf?\u201d Imogen asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes to all three. Here, put this away somewhere safe. You\u2019re now officially the richest person I know,\u201d I said, handing Nikola a check. \u201cYou\u2019re also the only baron I know, but that\u2019s probably beside the point. The coin dude wanted me to wait until morning so he could give me cash, but I said we were going to be leaving town tonight, and that we\u2019d trust him for a check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d Fran asked from where she sat next to Ben. The minivan was full to the gills with Viking ghosts, Nikola\u2019s children, and Fran. \u201cIs he going to do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shook my head, my gaze on Nikola where he sat in the front passenger seat. \u201cHe refused to play along and call up the mysterious man who offered him the silver coins. He said it was unethical, or some such crap.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you threaten to beat him?\u201d Nikola inquired politely.</p><p>\u201cI am a pacifist, dammit! Of course I didn\u2019t threaten to beat him up!\u201d</p><p>Nikola raised one eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cOK, maybe I said I had friends who wouldn\u2019t take kindly to him not doing as I asked, but that\u2019s entirely different from saying I was going to punch him in the gooch if he didn\u2019t do what I wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a gooch?\u201d I heard Imogen ask from the back row of seats.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to know; it\u2019s very rude,\u201d I said quickly, glaring at Nikola.</p><p>\u201cIn what form, then, will his help take?\u201d Nikola asked.</p><p>I thinned my lips. \u201cHow on earth do you know that he\u2019s helping us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not angry. You are not swearing. Therefore, you are not upset with him, which you would be if you were unable to get any information from him. What form did it take?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn address.\u201d I started the car, and pulled out of my pocket a slip of paper. \u201cEvidently you weren\u2019t the only one who had the bright idea of using a shill with ID to sell coins. Herr Kenner was so kind as to give me the address of a person who sold him several thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of silver coins when I told him I\u2019d sell your coins to his competitor. Turns out he\u2019s an avid collector of old Austrian money, and he was just about drooling when I let him have them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we go there now? It\u2019s getting pretty late,\u201d Fran pointed out.</p> <p>I looked at the clock in the van. \u201cI suppose midnight is a bit too late to be showing up on someone\u2019s doorstep. Do you think it would be safe to wait until morning?\u201d I asked Nikola.</p><p>\u201cWith regards to Rolf, do you mean? I do not see that a slight delay will endanger us, no.\u201d</p><p>You just want to go back to the hotel and do wicked things to me, don\u2019t you?</p><p>Oh, yes.</p><p>And I want you to do each and every one of them. Multiple times. However, right now, I think our time would be better spent tackling the issue of your brother.</p><p>Better spent? He let me feel just how badly he wanted to feed on me.</p><p>Feast, sweetling, feast, not feed. Anyone can feed me, but only you offer me a feast of endless delights.</p><p>\u201cRight, that is going to get you bonus points,\u201d I told him, and pulled out into the sparse traffic.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d Imogen asked, giggling when her ghost nibbled on her neck.</p><p>\u201cI said that Io offered me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhem! No kissing and telling.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWe weren\u2019t kissing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a phrase. File it away for colloquial night. Right now, I think it is more important that we tackle Rolf than to give in to some people\u2019s lustful thoughts, no matter how tantalizing they are, especially the ones involving some sort of swing of such erotic complexity that it would be wholly at home in a high-end sex shop.\u201d</p><p>Ben and Fran laughed aloud.</p><p>They have shops that sell sexual favors?</p><p>No. Well, I\u2019m sure they do, but that\u2019s not what I meant. And stop distracting me with smutty thoughts. I have to concentrate on making this GPS unit speak English so it can tell us where we\u2019re going.</p><p>Nikola glanced at the electronic device I indicated, pulling out his notebook. Colloquial night had better be soon, because I am fast filling up this journal.</p><p>The address that Herr Kenner had given me turned out to be about twenty-five minutes out of town, in a large, ranch-style house that sat on the other side of the valley, with an outstanding view of not only St. Andras but the ruins of the castle, as well.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how your uncle found this place,\u201d Fran told Ben as we silently marched up the long flagstone walkway to a Gothic-reproduction door. \u201cBut he has very good taste. This house is gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery pretty,\u201d Imogen agreed. \u201cThe view is outstanding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think maybe just Nikola and I should be the ones to approach his brother,\u201d I said, looking over the group of people with a somewhat critical eye. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of a large group.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s safety in numbers,\u201d Fran pointed out.</p><p>\u201cAye, and in swords,\u201d Finnvid answered, pulling his from a scabbard strapped across his back.</p><p>\u201cShe has a point,\u201d Ben said, taking Fran by the arm. He gestured to the flowering shrubs lining the opposite side of the walkway. \u201cImogen, you and Finnvid hide behind that big plant. Francesca and I will be on the other side of the lawn, behind that hedge. We\u2019ll be nearby if you need us.\u201d</p><p>We waited until everyone had taken their places before Nikola pressed the button beneath an intercom, looking askance at it when a disembodied voice said something in German.</p><p>Nikola answered in kind. The voice asked what I wanted. I told it that I wished to speak with Rolf.</p><p>Huh. You\u2019d have thought they would have something to say to that.</p><p>Nikola tensed, tugging me to the side until I was partially hidden by his body. There is someone behind the door. I can hear breathing.</p><p>The door clicked, and was open by a slim, elegant-looking young man with large gray eyes, dark, carefully tousled hair, and wearing a tight-fitting, expensive suit made of some shiny navy blue material that would have been right at home on the set of one of the Queer Eye TV shows. \u201cYes? To whom did you wish to speak?\u201d</p><p>The man spoke with a slight German accent, and a hint of a lisp that seemed more affected than authentic.</p><p>Nikola made him a very slight bow. \u201cI understand that my brother Rolf is here. Rolf von Linden. We wish to see him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. You must be the bawon.\u201d The man eyed first Nikola\u2014and I noticed that his visual examination seemed to take an inordinate amount of time\u2014then me before sighing and stepping back, gesturing us into the house. \u201cVewy well, but you cannot stay long. Heww von Linden is assisting me with a little pwoject, and we weally cannot take much time fwom it.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him for a few seconds, wondering why he felt it necessary to exaggerate his speech impediment to such a point where it was almost a parody, but decided that it wasn\u2019t important.</p><p>Nikola led the way into the house, telling me as he did so, Stay close to me, Io. Until we speak to Rolf, I do not trust him.</p><p>Me, either. For one, I\u2019d like to sic a few gay friends on him. And for another, he just seems too slick to be true. He didn\u2019t even bat an eyelash when you asked for Rolf.</p><p>The door closed behind me with a finality that sent a little shiver down my back. I turned back when the man at the door made a slight noise of satisfaction. Then there\u2019s the matter of that.</p><p>What? Nikola turned, frowning a little at the object held in the man\u2019s hand. What is that?</p><p>It\u2019s called a Taser, and I suspect we\u2019re going to\u2014</p><p>The world exploded in a burst of blue, red, and purple pain that swirled around and in me, sucking me down into its murky depths.</p><p>17 July</p><p>The voices seemed to ebb and flow like the water Nikola had seen on a beach in the south of France\u2014with soft, gentle little laps at his awareness that allowed him to drift aimlessly on a sea of insensibility.</p><p>If only the voices would stop nudging him, he could relax fully. But that wasn\u2019t really true, was it? He couldn\u2019t relax, not when danger hung overhead, danger for\u2014\u201cIo!\u201d he gasped aloud, and leaped to his feet without being aware that he had been lying on a cold stone floor. Sweetling, where are you?</p><p>There was no answering voice in his head, no sense of her presence, of her warmth, of everything about her that seemed so natural to him, it was no more than an extension of his being. Io? Are you well?</p><p>He snarled wordlessly at the silence that was his only answer, quickly taking in his surroundings. He was in some sort of a monk\u2019s cell, a narrow room with a sliver of a window high on the wall. The room was bare of furniture, possessing only the window and a door.</p><p>He rushed to the door, intending on jerking it open, but it was locked, and remained steadfastly closed despite his attempt to force it otherwise.</p><p>The memory of the strange, lisping man holding an oddly shaped pistol on himself and Io tormented him, mostly because he was convinced that some ill had befallen her, an ill he should have prevented. Do not fear, my love, I will find you. And should you be harmed, I will see to it that the whoreson who touched you will die a prolonged and painful death.</p><p>He rattled the door a few more times, paced the length of the cell for approximately a quarter of an hour, and was about to give in to the urge to swear loudly and profanely at his stupidity in allowing Io to be placed in harm\u2019s way when the analytical side of his mind, that which regularly held debates with the more frivolous part, urged him to look again at the door.</p><p>It was hewn of a solid wood, oak most likely, bound in iron. He narrowed his eyes at the lock and the round, circular door pull that served as a handle.</p><p>It looked familiar. It looked very familiar. It looked, in fact, just like those found in the row of rooms in the murky depths of his own castle, rooms that were stuffed with odds and ends, broken furniture, cast-off items of everyday usage, and a wine cellar that had been his father\u2019s pride.</p><p>A slow smile curled his lips. Bless you, Io, for giving me presents. He pulled from his pocket the small flat object that Io had slipped into his hand when they left the hotel earlier that day, saying she\u2019d picked it up at the men\u2019s shop where she\u2019d bought his clothes. \u201cIt\u2019s some sort of a survival gadget. It has a tiny little knife, and a screwdriver, and tweezers, and a bunch of other little things that are supposed to come in handy. I thought it looked kind of scientific, so you\u2019d like it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I do indeed like it, he told her, even if she couldn\u2019t hear him. He examined the flat object, about half the size of his palm, before eventually extracting a long, thin tool. Seven minutes later, he\u2019d taken apart the ancient lock, and pulled open the door to his cell. Like the cellar back home, the room he emerged into was dimly lit, this time, by a globe overhead.</p><p>\u201cBulb, not globe,\u201d he corrected himself, remembering that Io had called the object that made light out of nothing a bulb. This bulb was hung somewhat haphazardly on a cord that wove drunkenly down the ceiling, disappearing into the wall at the far end.</p><p>He glanced around, noting the narrow passage lined with numerous doors. There was no one in sight, and unable to resist the desire to know what was in the nearest room, he tried the door. It was locked. As was the one next to it, and on down the passage. Nikola walked to the end where his own cell had been, pulled out the tiny screwdriver, and went to work on the lock of nearest door. It was a bit more rusted than his had been, but after a few minutes\u2019 work, he was able to open the door.</p> <p>The air that swirled out to cover him was fetid, rank with the odor of unwashed bodies, and blood. His nose wrinkled with the scent of rotting animal flesh at the same moment that whatever was within the cell realized he was at the door. An inhuman howl of rage rent the air, and another swish of air warned of the swift movement within. Nikola just had time to see a pair of burning black eyes beneath a matted, filthy mass of hair before he slammed the door shut again, hastily twisting the lock so that it caught into the teeth of the mechanism. A second howl followed the slam of a large body against the solid door. Nikola quickly screwed the faceplate back onto the lock, the memory of those insane, burning eyes giving him pause.</p><p>\u201cIf they captured me, they must have done likewise to Io,\u201d he said softly, and went to the next door, carefully stripping the lock down to where he could open it. He cracked the door just enough to catch a whiff of the air contained within, found it just as abominable as the last one, and had the door closed and locked before the occupant even knew he was there.</p><p>Three more such rooms followed before he came to one that didn\u2019t bear the odor of animalistic, violent humans.</p><p>He peered cautiously into it, opening the door a little wider when the air smelled nothing worse than a little musty. A figure lay curled up in the corner, but it wasn\u2019t the figure of a man. It was a large, cinnamon-colored lion, and it stood up slowly, its eyes wary as Nikola glanced around its cell.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t happen to be named David, would you?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>The lion blinked at him for a few seconds; then its entire body seemed to shudder and ripple before changing into that of a nude man. \u201cIt\u2019s Daffyd, actually, but everyone calls me David. Are you one of de Marco\u2019s men?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have clothing? Your nudity does not disturb me, but I would not like Io to be exposed to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr...\u201d The man stepped back to where a pile of clothing sat in the corner. \u201cIo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. She is my woman. She is highly sensitive, and would not care to see you without clothing. In your human form, that is. I believe she would greatly enjoy seeing your lion form. It is true she has stated that she takes much pleasure in seeing me without clothing, but I cannot believe that to see others would be at all pleasing to her. You must be a therion. My son mentioned you to me. He did not, however, say that you would be sans clothing. Ah. That is better. Do you know where Io is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d David had a slight Welsh accent.</p><p>Nikola studied him, this man his son had chosen for a blood brother. He was still somewhat disturbed that Benedikt and Imogen could believe him capable of severing all ties with them, his beloved children, and he felt instinctively that Benedikt, for whatever reason, had felt the loss of a father more than Imogen. He badly wanted to know what sort of a man his son had turned out to be, so logically, he must look to the people with whom he had surrounded himself.</p> <p>But that could wait until he found Io and reassured himself that she was not harmed. \u201cI must find her. You may accompany me if you desire. I realize that my son seeks your freedom, but Io\u2019s safety must come first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, if she is your woman, then I imagine it must,\u201d David replied with a little amusement in his eyes. \u201cI will accompany you, although I don\u2019t quite understand just who you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am Nikola Czerny.\u201d He turned on his heel and left the cell, moving to the last three doors.</p><p>\u201cCzerny? Are you related to Benedikt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is my son.\u201d The next cell smelled worse than a privy. Nikola hastily closed the door and turned to the second-to-last door.</p><p>\u201cFerals. What a tragedy. They are long past saving. I thought you were dead,\u201d David said, peering over Nikola\u2019s shoulder as he unbolted the lock. \u201cBen said something once about you not being around anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was the incorrect past, according to Io.\u201d He exhaled in relief when a familiar scent caught his nose as he opened the door a crack. The air smelled of warm, sleepy woman, his warm, sleepy woman, one who was lying on her side with her back to the door. \u201cIo! Are you injured?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t appear to be. He rushed to her side, quickly making an examination of her body parts. Arms and legs appeared to be untouched, as was her face. In fact, she appeared to be doing nothing more sinister than taking a nap.</p> <p>\u201cSweetling, wake up.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t seem to want to. He scooped her up and rose, a need to get her to safety overriding his curiosity about where they had been taken, and who was behind their abduction.</p><p>\u201cIs she all right?\u201d David asked, following when he strode back down the long, narrow corridor.</p><p>\u201cI assume so, since there are no markings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid de Marco capture you, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not sure. There was a man with a slight lisp and some sort of bulky firearm that Io said was a Teaser, but we were tracking my brother when we found him, so it not clear to me who is responsible for\u2014can you hold her for me, please?\u201d</p><p>David looked surprised as Nikola thrust Io\u2019s warm, supple body into his arms. Nikola hesitated a moment, giving the younger man a good, stern look. \u201cYou will not enjoy the warmth of her body against yours. You will not admire her satiny freckled skin. You will not desire to touch her breasts and thighs and other parts. She is my woman.\u201d</p><p>The therion had the cheek to grin. \u201cYou really have it bad. Like father, like son, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIo is not like my daughter-by-marriage. She does not perch on the side of my chair and ruffle her hand through my hair. She does, however, sit on my lap, which pleases me more. If you would stand a little out of the light of the bulb, I will disassemble this lock and we shall free ourselves.\u201d</p><p>The lock of the door to the corridor was just as old as the cell doors, and it was only a matter of a minute before he reclaimed the still sleeping Io, and followed David up a narrow flight of wooden stairs.</p><p>Right into a room containing two surprised-looking people seated around a long table dotted with food and drink.</p><p>Nikola took one look at the occupants of the room, and gave David Io\u2019s delicious form again. \u201cWould you mind holding her once more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I would. I have a score to settle with that man,\u201d David said, handing her back, his voice rough with emotion and his eyes glittering with an unholy light.</p><p>\u201cWhat the deuce are you doing up here?\u201d Rolf, who had been stuffing his face with a turkey leg, sputtered bits of greasy turkey skin and flesh as he shoved back his chair and leaped to his feet. \u201cHow did you get out of the cell? Damn me, man, you told me he wouldn\u2019t be able to get out!\u201d</p><p>The lisping man who had incapacitated them rose to his feet, as well, but it was David he was staring in horror at, not Rolf. David\u2019s body did that rippling, shifting motion that resulted in him stalking forward in lion form.</p><p>\u201cDid you see that, sweetling?\u201d Nikola asked Io, shaking her slightly in case she was on the verge of waking up. \u201cIt\u2019s fascinating. I must make a comprehensive study of how it\u2019s done. You can assist me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit, Nikola, I demand to know how you got free!\u201d Rolf set down his turkey leg and advanced, his narrow eyes now only little slits in a face that Nikola was shocked to realize was filled with malice.</p><p>He looked for somewhere safe where he could set down Io, but at that moment, she stirred.</p><p>\u201cHrang?\u201d she asked, blinking her eyes and frowning as she tried to focus on him. She lifted a hand and poked him in the cheek. \u201cNia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sweetling, it\u2019s me. Sit here while I deal with my brother.\u201d He placed her in a chair and turned to Rolf, who had snatched up a long carving knife and was advancing upon him.</p><p>A soft, slithering noise behind him had him whirling back to Io just in time to see her fall off the chair and land face-first onto the floor. She lifted her head slightly, and said in a voice thick with befuddlement, \u201cOw. Nikla?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay there, my love,\u201d he commanded, turning back to face his brother. \u201cRolf, I am disappointed in you. If Mother were alive, you would have broken her heart.\u201d</p><p>Rolf froze, fury overtaking his expression of malice. \u201cHow dare you mention her!\u201d</p><p>A scream echoed from the far end of the room where David the lion had pounced on the lisping man.</p><p>\u201cDo not kill him yet,\u201d Nikola called to David as the lion began savaging the man now crawling on the floor and babbling for mercy. \u201cHe conducted an act of Teasing against Io, and thus I must exact my revenge on him, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaser,\u201d Io said thickly. \u201cThat was it. That precious guy had a Taser. Gonna whack him on the kneecaps with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were the one who brought her endless grief,\u201d Rolf yelled, gesturing with the knife. \u201cIf you had died like you were supposed to do, she would have gotten over it. But no, you had to bargain with that demon lord to make you immortal, and she worried herself into her grave over what happened to you.\u201d</p><p>Nikola stared in stark surprise at his brother, ignoring the sounds behind him of muttered swearing and a chair scraping as if someone was using it to pull her still-dazed self to her feet. Do not harm yourself, sweetling. I will be able to assist you just as soon as I\u2019ve dealt with Rolf. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m OK, she answered, her thoughts still a bit confused and somewhat scattered. I love you, Nikola.</p><p>He shot a startled glance over his shoulder.</p><p>Whoops. Did you hear that?</p> <p>Yes.</p><p>Frak. Can you pretend you didn\u2019t?</p><p>No.</p><p>An adorably indignant look crossed over her face. She made an effort to straighten up and glare at him. Well, I think you could if you put your mind to it.</p><p>We will talk about this later, Io. Right now I must ascertain just what Rolf meant by his statement.</p> <p>What statement? Rolf is here? She squinted past him. Oh, yeah, he is here. Can I break his kneecaps?</p><p>He shook his head, turning back to Rolf. It is not seemly for me to stand by and do nothing while you mete out revenge. No, I must be the one to break his kneecaps. I am nothing if not generous, however, and for that reason, I will allow you to box his ears.</p><p>I have no idea what\u2019s involved with ear boxing, and frankly, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to want to know, so you can just get off your he-man high horse, and let me have a shot at the kneecapping\u2014Nikola!</p><p>Io screamed in his head just as Rolf lunged at him, the knife held high. Nikola, long a devotee of esoteric manuscripts from the Far East, lashed out with his foot and knocked the knife out of Rolf\u2019s hand.</p><p>Rolf screamed in a perfect echo of the lisping man, who was now blocked from view by the large body of an extremely annoyed lion. \u201cYou\u2019ve broken my hand! My own brother has broken my hand!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Nikola said coolly, picking up the knife and gesturing with it. \u201cBut I will do so if you attempt to harm Io or me again. How did you know about the demon lord who cursed me? I never told you how it happened.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho do you think arranged for him to kill you?\u201d Rolf said sullenly, clutching his hand to his chest as he slumped into a chair, defeat visible in his posture.</p><p>\u201cI knew it,\u201d Io said, limping forward.</p><p>Did he harm your leg?</p><p>No, I whacked it on the chair trying to stand up. Did you hear him? He as much as admitted that he was the one responsible for hiring the demon lord to off you. Io snatched up a broom and continued on toward Rolf.</p><p>\u201cKeep your whore away from me,\u201d Rolf said with a curl to his lip, leaning to the side just as if she were polluting the very air with her presence.</p><p>Gee thanks.</p><p>Pardon?</p><p>For thinking that bit about me polluting the air.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t say you were, I was merely noting to myself what Rolf did, so that I might record it in my notes at a later time. No, my love, do not try to beat him with that broom. For one, you aren\u2019t strong enough, and for another, he is not the one responsible for my curse.</p><p>He just said he was! Do you need to clean your ears or something?</p><p>Another scream from the man David was attacking diverted his attention for a moment. \u201cDavid?\u201d</p><p>With reluctance, the lion backed up a few steps, shimmered in that unique way he had, and resumed the shape of a man.</p><p>\u201cHoly naked man!\u201d Io\u2019s eyes widened as she stared at David.</p><p>\u201cEr...hello. You must be Io.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. And you\u2019re...you were...were you just a lion a second ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I am a therion.\u201d David made a little bow to her that had her jaw dropping a smidgen.</p><p>\u201cAvert your eyes, sweetling,\u201d Nikola told her. \u201cI know how distressing it must be for you to view another man without his clothing on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, it\u2019s terribly distressing,\u201d Io said, continuing to stare as David picked up his clothing and once again began to don it. \u201cI\u2019m feeling traumatized. Wow, he really has a nice\u2014\u201d</p><p>Nikola scowled. Io bit off the sentence and gave him a weak smile. \u201cSorry, punkin. It just took me by surprise. Carry on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He turned back to Rolf, who was now moodily watching the lisping man weakly flail around on the floor. \u201cRolf, tell me how you know about the demon lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich one? The one who cursed you, or the one who helped me find Lemuel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is Lemuel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHim.\u201d Rolf nodded toward the man writhing and moaning on the floor.</p><p>\u201cJust so. You have met with a demon lord recently?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat business is it of yours?\u201d Rolf snapped in reply.</p><p>\u201cIt most certainly is my business if you arrange for Io and me to be kidnapped and taken to a lichmaster who evidently has an interest in torturing Dark Ones.\u201d</p><p>Rolf shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know about a lichmaster, but I did talk to Ashtaroth, a demon lord who put me in contact with Lemuel. He said his master would reward me greatly once he found out about the portal in Zauberwald.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAshtaroth,\u201d Nikola said slowly. David, now fully clothed, moved around to stand slightly behind them. Io gave him a long look before returning her attention to where it should be.</p><p>That\u2019s the guy who Ben and Fran were looking for.</p><p>Yes. He has a lion form, as you saw. Later, we might make a study of how he shifts form.</p><p>We might make a study?</p><p>I thought that you might wish to assist me in my studies.</p><p>She smiled, and warmth flooded through his loins, spreading out to his limbs. You\u2019d let me help?</p><p>Of course. You, too, have a scientific mind, and like to learn new things. You will be of a great help to me.</p><p>Nikola, I think that\u2019s just about the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me. Is Ashtaroth the demon lord who made you a vamp?</p><p>No. That demon lord\u2019s name was Magoth. \u201cHow did you know to contact a demon lord?\u201d</p><p>Rolf\u2019s expression was sulky and somewhat petulant. \u201cI suppose you\u2019re going to push and poke until you have all the answers, aren\u2019t you? You always were like that. You just had to know the answers to everything. That trait has always irritated me, do you know that? You don\u2019t care, do you? You never did. Well, brother mine, let me assuage that annoying curiosity of yours\u2014I knew how to contact Ashtaroth because I read my father\u2019s letters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father was the one who summoned Magoth,\u201d Nikola said, nodding. It fit with what he knew of his brothers\u2014they might be aggravating, and whiny, and constantly demanding more money from him, but they were not the murderous whoresons that Benedikt had hinted.</p><p>Your stepdad had you made into a vampire? Io asked in disbelief. Why?</p><p>\u201cIo wishes to know why your father summoned Magoth,\u201d Nikola told Rolf. \u201cShe did not know him as we did. She does not realize that he hated me, and resented the fact that I was the firstborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you know everything, don\u2019t you?\u201d Rolf\u2019s upper lip curled. \u201cWell, you don\u2019t. How\u2019s that feel, brother? Don\u2019t like it, do you? I can see by the look on your face that you\u2019re not going to let it rest until you hear it all, and since my head hurts and I want to go to bed and get some sleep, I\u2019ll tell you what my father did. Yes, he summoned Magoth, but he paid the demon lord to destroy you in the most heinous fashion he could manage. The stupid demon lord double-crossed my father, though, by making you a bloodsucker instead of tormenting you to death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is just about the most obscene thing I\u2019ve ever heard,\u201d Io said, clutching her broom tightly. Nikola put an arm around her to keep her from rushing his brother. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of some asshat stepparents before, but none of them were so jealous of their stepkids that they actually hunted down a demon lord! OK, so I didn\u2019t know there were such things as demon lords until Nikola told me, but still, my point stands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father didn\u2019t give a snap for Nikola being the firstborn,\u201d Rolf said, his shoulders slumping. He looked, Nikola thought, every one of his more than three hundred years.</p><p>\u201cDid he want Nikola\u2019s castle, then?\u201d Io asked, pressed close, her warmth seeping into all the dark places inside him. He wanted to scoop her up in his arms and locate the nearest bed, whereupon he would allow her to seduce him for several days. Nonstop.</p><p>\u201cPfft. Have you seen it? It\u2019s a ruins,\u201d Rolf said dismissively. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want the castle. He wanted the money, money that should have gone to my mother rather than Nikola, and thus to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were right,\u201d Io said with a look of admiration that warmed him to his toenails. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want your castle. This was all about money. But I don\u2019t understand why this demon lord dude turned you into a vamp instead of torturing you to death.\u201d</p><p>David laughed as Nikola gave her an outraged look.</p><p>\u201cSorry, punkin, that came out wrong. But you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe demon lord was deranged, that\u2019s why,\u201d Rolf said, reaching for the pitcher of ale. \u201cPapa paid him to destroy you, but Magoth thought it would be funny to make you into a bloodsucker instead. Papa was furious, of course, but there wasn\u2019t anything he could do about it because he had an apoplectic fit and died two days later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Io said, setting aside her broom. \u201cI can\u2019t say that I\u2019m sorry to hear that. What a poop.\u201d She glanced toward Nikola. \u201cSo now what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow we get you out of this place, and contact Benedikt to let him and Imogen know where we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ll have to do that,\u201d David said with a sudden smile, strolling across the kitchen to open a door that allowed sunlight to flood the room. Voices that were barely audible from outside grew louder, and before Nikola could so much as pull out his notebook to record the pertinent events of the last half hour, a group of eight people rushed into the room, voices high with excitement.</p><p>Benedikt and his soon-to-be ghost-by-marriage were at the front, with several other men following, and Imogen and Francesca bringing up the rear.</p><p>\u201cDavid!\u201d Benedikt shouted upon sighting his friend. The two men embraced as Francesca pushed forward.</p><p>\u201cNikola! Io! Oh, I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re all right. Ben, look, your dad found David.\u201d</p><p>Much confusion followed in the subsequent quarter hour, but it was Io who put an end to it by the method of standing on the long table, and placing her fingers in her mouth to perform an earsplitting whistle that froze everyone in their tracks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRight! Let\u2019s all simmer down so we can figure out who is who. Ben, are those dudes werewolves like David?\u201d Io asked, pointing at the four other men who were in a circle around David, all of whom were talking at the same time.</p><p>\u201cSorry, yes, those are members of his pride. We called them in when it became apparent that you and my father had been taken. The lich whose head we finally convinced to talk told us about this place. No one else was close enough to help, and we had some hope that if we found you here, we\u2019d be able to gain information about where David was being held, as well. We had no idea that we\u2019d find you all together.\u201d Ben clapped his friend on the back, his smile of such happiness that Nikola was well pleased.</p><p>My son is generous and free with his affection, he told Io, unable to keep the pride from her.</p> <p>She slid an arm around his waist. He is. I like him now that he\u2019s done being a jerk to you. I like Fran, too.</p><p>And Imogen? You will have no problems dealing with her? I have brought her up to be a modest, gentle maiden, but she always had her mother\u2019s will, and sometimes would not yield to my desires the way she should.</p><p>Io laughed into his head. I\u2019m sure she had you wrapped around her little finger. Yes, of course I like her. She\u2019s very nice, and I think she\u2019s very much in love with that Viking ghost. Him, I\u2019m not so sure of, but he seems to be crazy about her, too, so I guess all is well.</p><p>Yes, all is well. We can return home knowing that my children are as happy in their lives as we are in ours.</p><p>Io shot him a look, but said nothing.</p> <p>July 23</p><p>Boy, I can\u2019t tell you how good it is to be typing this up on a laptop, rather than writing with that horrible goose feather, or even writing it all out longhand on a spiral notebook from the St. Andras drugstore.</p><p>Nikola, of course, is fascinated by the laptop...but I\u2019m jumping ahead, and I swore I wasn\u2019t going to do that.</p><p>We got back to St. Andras about dinnertime a couple of nights ago. That was the same day that we found ourselves in Innsbruck (where the over-the-top lisping guy, whose name turned out to be Lemuel, had taken us), the day when I came out of my Taser-induced stupor to find Nikola being all brave and heroic and smart, and figuring out the truth behind his brothers and the whole deal with being made a vampire.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all very well and fine you knowing this,\u201d I said quietly to him a couple of hours later while Ben drove us in our rental van back to St. Andras. It was even more cramped in the van because now we had Rolf with us, as well, but obviously we couldn\u2019t leave him behind to sell out other vampires to the lichmaster dude. \u201cBut what are we going to do with him?\u201d</p><p>Nikola instantly knew whom I was talking about. We will have to take him back with us, naturally. And I will see to it that he does not abuse the portal.</p> <p>I bit my lip, a little queasy at the thought that Nikola was so calmly sure I would be going back to the past with him. I glanced around, but no one appeared to be paying attention to us as we drove through the mountains toward St. Andras. I thought we were going to stay here for a bit, so you could see how things worked, and appreciate all the technology and stuff that this century has.</p><p>We have stayed, he said with a little surprise. I have seen many things.</p><p>Yeah, but we haven\u2019t been here for very long. Certainly not long enough to see everything.</p><p>He considered me, his icy blue eyes not so icy when you knew what lay behind them. You wish to stay longer? We have Rolf. We have protected the Dark Ones of this time, and found David for Benedikt. There is nothing more to keep us here, unless you are worried that Rolf and Arnulf will attempt to murder me again. I have told you that I will take care of that situation, too.</p><p>Yeah, by giving them more money.</p><p>He shrugged. I have more than I need, and they have not many years left to them. It cannot hurt me to give up a little more wealth to them.</p><p>I\u2019m sure they had enough to begin with, but that\u2019s not the point.</p><p>Then what is?</p> <p>I made a vague sort of gesture. I just thought you\u2019d want to stay here for a bit. There are so many wonders to be seen here.</p><p>But if I learn them all, what will I have left to study?</p><p>He had me there. I was left to gnaw my lower lip and keep my dark, unhappy thoughts to myself as we drove back into town.</p><p>It was dusk when we arrived at the fairgrounds.</p><p>\u201cI thought David was following us?\u201d Fran said as she got out of the van.</p><p>I took the hand Nikola offered, and got out, as well, stretching from the long ride.</p><p>\u201cHe will be along later. He needed some time with his pride before he rejoins us and we can go over all that happened, and what we\u2019ll do next about de Marco,\u201d Ben answered.</p><p>\u201cI do not understand why you insisted on bringing me back here,\u201d Rolf groused as he emerged from the van. \u201cI do not wish to be here. It is not nearly as exciting as Innsbruck. I wish to return to Innsbruck. I wish to be paid the amount of money that is owed to me for the capture of my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be paid a knuckle sandwich and a two-by-four across the knees if you don\u2019t knock it off,\u201d I mumbled, evidently not soft enough to escape Nikola\u2019s ears.</p><p>Woman, you are not helping matters.</p><p>Bah. He\u2019s being a pain in the ass and you know it.</p><p>Yes, and you are inflaming his anger. I do not wish to have to separate you while we are here in your time, but I will if I must.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but giggle at his stern-dad voice. You\u2019re so cute when you\u2019re fatherly.</p><p>I assure you, Io, at this moment I feel anything but fatherly toward you.</p><p>Oooh, someone\u2019s hungry, I said, slinking toward him with a look in my eyes that should let him know just how much I wanted to sate his desires. All of them.</p><p>He started toward me at the same moment, but unfortunately, life or fate or whoever it is who dictates when things get messed up chose that moment to put a halt to what I hoped would be one hell of an evening.</p><p>It will be one hell of an evening, sweetling. Just one that is delayed for a short while.</p><p>\u201cImogen! Benedikt! You are back so soon?\u201d Tallulah emerged from between two tents, holding a squirming pug puppy in her arms. \u201cHave you run into trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust the opposite,\u201d Fran said, smiling. \u201cWe found David with Nikola and Io. And there were only two guys guarding them, one of which was Ben\u2019s uncle, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Tallulah held up her hand, glancing over at a group of tourists that were waiting for the ticket stand to open. \u201cPerhaps we should continue this elsewhere? There is half an hour before the fair is to commence.\u201d</p><p>We all followed her into her trailer, some of us more reluctantly than others.</p><p>\u201cI hate to be a party pooper, or appear ungrateful that you guys came to save us, and now want to rehash the experience\u2014not that we haven\u2019t done that during the three-hour ride here\u2014but Nikola\u2019s hungry, I\u2019m hungry, and we still have to figure out what we\u2019re going to do with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNikola, your woman is being rude to me,\u201d Rolf said, sniffing when he was forced to take a seat next to Finnvid.</p><p>\u201cIn what manner is she being rude?\u201d Nikola asked, smiling into my mind when I sat on his lap.</p><p>\u201cChairs are in demand,\u201d I told Eirik the ghost when he raised his eyebrows.</p><p>He grinned.</p><p>\u201cShe keeps referring to me as him. With an emphasis on the word that is not at all pleasant, or even respectful.\u201d Rolf sniffed again, and told Finnvid, \u201cMy father may not have been a baron, but he was very wellborn, and I will not be looked down upon by a whore.\u201d</p><p>Finnvid looked at me in openmouthed amazement. \u201cThe Goddess Fran\u2019s mother-by-marriage, soon-to-be my mother-by-marriage, is a whore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, the next person who says that word is getting a punch on the schnoz,\u201d I said, waving a fist in the air.</p><p>And you do not think you are bloodthirsty.</p><p>No, I\u2019m not. You are, because you\u2019re always thirsty for my blood. But me? I\u2019m a pacifist through and through. I\u2019m just not going to stand for your nasty little brother to keep saying I\u2019m a slut.</p><p>I\u2019ve explained to you that he heard that from Frau Leiven when we were all mistaken about you\u2014</p><p>I know, I know, but he can just get with the program and realize that it was simply a matter of difference of apparel between centuries. Oh, hell, now Tallulah\u2019s been talking and I haven\u2019t listened to a word. Hush so I can listen.</p><p>Nikola gave a mental eye roll (it\u2019s not as awkward as it sounds), and pulled me tighter against him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Imogen was in the middle of saying. \u201cYou told us that we needed to find Rolf to save people from being killed, and we have done so. Why is the world still unbalanced and in peril?\u201d</p><p>Tallulah, who had given Imogen the puppy to hold in order to take up her bowl of water, consulted it. I leaned forward to see what it was that the bowl held, but all I saw was an inky blackness. \u201cThe balance of time is still skewed because the threat still remains.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Rolf with mean eyes.</p><p>\u201cNikola!\u201d he said, pointing at me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing anything!\u201d I protested.</p><p>\u201cYou mean Ben\u2019s uncle?\u201d Fran asked from where she was (once again, drat her young self) draped on the arm of Ben\u2019s chair.</p><p>\u201cHe is part of it, but he is not the whole,\u201d Tallulah intoned, staring at her bowl. \u201cThe means by which the deaths of countless souls can be made still exists, and will continue to exist until it is no more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe swirly thing?\u201d I asked, my stomach turning over. Oh, I wanted the portal closed, all right, with Nikola and me on this side of it, but I also knew just how much he wanted to go home. But this was my home, not his, my time, not one with which he was familiar.</p><p>\u201cThe portal that you summoned must be closed. It is known to too many people now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only guys who know about it are us, Rolf, and that Lemuel guy, and David has him, so I don\u2019t imagine he\u2019s going to have any opportunity to do anything but be mauled by a bunch of angry lions,\u201d I pointed out.</p><p>\u201cThat is not true, sweetling,\u201d Nikola said, looking past me to Rolf. \u201cIs it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rolf started, guilt chasing fear across his face. \u201cEr...what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho else did you tell about the portal?\u201d Nikola asked, his voice deceptively calm. I knew better, however. Beneath the surface, his anger was as hot as the hunger that he held at bay. \u201cWho else did you give the means to destroy Dark Ones?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one! I told no one! Er... I might have hinted at something like a portal to the demon lord Ashtaroth, but\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Nikola gave a mental groan.</p><p>That\u2019s bad, yes?</p><p>Very bad.</p><p>I glared at Rolf. \u201cYou bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy parents were properly wed!\u201d he snapped back, but the fire had gone out in him. He slumped back, his arms across his chest, and glared at us all.</p> <p>Io\u2014</p><p>I know, I know. I cleared my throat, not wanting to say what had to be said, but seeing no other way around it. \u201cI have to close the swirly thing. I don\u2019t know how to do that, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will find the way,\u201d Tallulah said, pushing back the bowl. I was uncomfortably aware of her gaze on me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad someone has faith in me, because I have to admit that right now I don\u2019t.\u201d I took a deep breath and glanced at Nikola. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you know how to lock up a portal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLock up? No.\u201d Tallulah rose to her feet, her hands flat on the table as she leaned toward me. \u201cYou cannot simply close the portal, Io. You must destroy it for good so that no one may ever use it again. That is the only way to bring back balance, and to ensure it remains.\u201d</p><p>I felt literally sick to my stomach with the knowledge of what this would mean to Nikola. I looked at him, taking in those bright pale blue eyes ringed with impossibly thick black lashes, his long, straight aquiline nose, that chin that I loved biting so much, and felt a few tears burn behind my own eyes. I\u2019m sorry, punkin. I\u2019m so sorry.</p> <p>He gave me a supportive squeeze. I know you are, and I will do what I can to make your life a happy one.</p><p>\u201cYou will...huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will do everything in my power to make sure that you do not regret the choice to stay with me,\u201d he answered, filling my head with all sorts of erotic promises.</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m going to go back with you before I destroy the swirly portal?\u201d I asked, knowing the answer even as the words left my lips. Of course he expected that\u2014he always intended on returning back to his time, and assumed I\u2019d be going back with him. \u201cBut...we\u2019re here now. Couldn\u2019t we just stay here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-oh,\u201d Fran murmured, getting up and pulling Ben up after her. \u201cI think this is where we make ourselves scarce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe that would be wise,\u201d Tallulah said, glancing at her watch. \u201cYou may make use of my trailer as long as you need it. I will be in my booth, should you wish to consult with me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you taking me?\u201d Rolf said in an outraged voice when Finnvid, after a whisper from Imogen, yanked him to his feet and shoved him along the aisle. \u201cUnhand me, you deranged spirit!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome with me, Uncle Rolf,\u201d Imogen said in her soothing voice. \u201cPapa and Io need a few minutes alone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what they need, I will not be treated in this manner\u2014\u201d</p><p>In a matter of seconds, the trailer was cleared of everyone, the puppy included. I stroked a hand along Nikola\u2019s cheek, relishing the emotions that rolled through me when he turned his head to kiss my palm.</p><p>\u201cYou do not wish to return with me.\u201d</p><p>It was a statement, not a question, and behind it was an entire world of pain.</p><p>\u201cI want to be with you. I want to spend my life with you. Dammit, I already told you that I was in love with you, and I don\u2019t have any idea how or when that happened, because everything was just fine with us being fond of each other, and now I just want to cry because I do love you, Nikola. I love you so much I want to stand on top of this trailer and yell it out to everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you do not wish to return with me to my home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that. I liked your castle. But you haven\u2019t spent as much time here as I spent in your time. There\u2019s so much more to see, Nikola. So many cool gadgets and scientific crap and advances that you can\u2019t even dream of, and you\u2019ll never know about them if we go back to your time. We\u2019ll never have a microwave, or a laptop, or even a hair dryer, and let me tell you, I miss my hair dryer almost more than I do modern underwear and toilet paper. Well, OK, not more than toilet paper. That really is something that is missed once it\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what of Andras Castle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...we can rebuild it, and live there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat of the servants? How will they go on without me to provide for them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been dead three hundred years, Nikola.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they were alive when we left. It\u2019s not that I care about them, you understand. I simply do not like shirking my duties.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head at him, warmed at the genuine concern for others that he felt. \u201cOh, come on. I think we both know that you are Mr. Pushover when it comes to any misfit you run across. Why else would you have that motley collection of servants? But honestly, I\u2019m sure they got along just fine before they met you, as they did after you went through the portal.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me, just looked at me for a few minutes, keeping his thoughts closed off so I couldn\u2019t hear what it was he was thinking. But I felt his emotions. I felt the pain, and the doubt, and the need to protect. I felt his innate nobility of character, and I knew what he was going to say before he said it.</p><p>\u201cThen we will stay here, in your time. We will take up our lives here, and begin again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNikola\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He laid a finger across my lips. I bit it. \u201cI did not think I was capable of it, but somehow, it has overtaken me, as well. You are my life now, Io. You are my heart and being and I cannot think of existing without you. You say you love me so much you wish to yell out your feelings\u2014I love you so much that I am willing to do whatever it takes to make you happy. We will remain here, in your time, and you will spend endless nights making up to me the sacrifice I have made because I love you so greatly.\u201d</p><p>I laughed and kissed him, tears spilling over my eyelashes as I let him feel the depth of my emotions for him. And I love you so much that I\u2019m going to let you get away with that wholly and utterly outrageous statement. Come on, lover boy, let\u2019s go back to the hotel so I can feed you. Then we\u2019ll go do a bit of shopping.</p><p>\u201cShopping?\u201d he asked, allowing me to escape his lap. \u201cMore presents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore presents. But this time, I think, we\u2019ll get me some. And I need to call my cousin. But mostly, I want to shop.\u201d</p><p>He said nothing, but gave me a long look as I left the trailer.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why, but I feel kind of sad,\u201d Fran said softly as, several hours later, we stood before the swirly portal.</p><p>\u201cHe made his choice,\u201d Ben told her, giving her a squeeze.</p><p>\u201cYes, but it seems kind of sad that he\u2019s going to give up his home just to stay here. I mean, I totally understand, because now is much nicer than three hundred years ago, and of course, he has Io and you and Imogen and everything, but it still seems kind of a shame.\u201d</p><p>I set down the large carrier bag that held a bit of shopping we\u2019d done before the shops all closed. We\u2019d come straight to the clearing from my shopping spree, stopping only long enough to pick up Nikola\u2019s children and brother before heading for the portal.</p><p>I stared at the swirling smoke as it twirled and twined around on itself, marveling once again that such an ethereal thing could work such miracles.</p><p>And be the tool of unspeakable horrors.</p><p>\u201cThis portal is going to be destroyed,\u201d I said loudly, my eyes on Rolf. He was extremely grumpy, having been woken up from where he was sleeping in Imogen\u2019s trailer, Finnvid having remained behind to guard him. \u201cYour demon lord buddy won\u2019t be able to use it to do squat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou woke me up for this?\u201d he asked, his voice shrill in the night air. \u201cYou dragged me out of a warm bed to be shown this portal? I have already seen it, woman!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to make sure that you understand that it\u2019s not going to be functioning anymore. No one will be able to go through it. You got that?\u201d</p><p>He said something in German that I suspected was very rude. Nikola gave a start, and answered back in a manner that had Rolf sniffing to himself and wrapping the blanket he held tightly around him.</p><p>So you think all I have to do is focus on this portal, and will it destroyed?</p><p>I believe if you focus all your attention on that, yes, you will be able to seal it forever.</p><p>I looked deeply into his eyes. I love you, Baron Nikola. I\u2019m going to expect you to marry me.</p><p>So you can be a baroness?</p><p>So I can be your baroness.</p><p>We will do so immediately, then. \u201cImogen, Io has proposed marriage to me, and I have accepted. You will enjoy witnessing our marriage ceremony.\u201d</p><p>I laughed out loud. \u201cYou aren\u2019t supposed to tell people I proposed to you, you big oaf.\u201d I moved around the portal to hug Imogen, who was offering her congratulations. \u201cI was wrong about your father. I am madly in love with him, even though I just know he\u2019s going to tell everyone that I proposed to him. Despite that, I will make him very, very happy. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that you already do,\u201d she said, giving me a kiss on the cheek.</p><p>I hugged Fran, as well, since she was standing next to Imogen. \u201cAnd I forgive you for being mean to my future husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMean? Me?\u201d She giggled. \u201cI would never!\u201d</p><p>I laughed with her, passing Ben and the two Vikings, stopping at Finnvid, who stood with one hand on Rolf. \u201cMy name is Iolanthe,\u201d I told the former, giving him a little hug, too. \u201cNote the consonants in it. Just don\u2019t name a girl Yolanda, OK? Rolf. You know, I can\u2019t think of a life more annoying than having it filled with you. So I think I\u2019m going to take pity on everyone.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I smiled at the startled look on his face, and ignored the warning voice in my head. Io, what are you about?</p><p>Before Rolf could do more than sputter a profanity, I grabbed him by his shirt and, using the one move I could remember from my self-defense class, spun him around, directly at the portal. He gave a shriek, his arms cartwheeling wildly, and then all was quiet.</p><p>\u201cSweetling,\u201d Nikola said, shaking his head as he strolled over to me. \u201cI know you disliked him, but now we will not be able to keep an eye on him.\u201d</p> <p>I licked the tip of his nose before wrapping my arms around his waist. \u201cI want you to be happy, too, you know. It matters more to me than anything. More even than showing you just how fabulous the future can be. I love you so much, I\u2019m willing to sacrifice even my need for toilet paper.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t expect it, not at all, and for that, I was grateful. Because if he knew in advance that I was going to flip him over my hip, right into the portal, and follow him through a second later, he would have made a big deal about it.</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s not a big deal,\u201d I told him half a day later, when we woke up to find ourselves lying in the afternoon shade of the trees. \u201cI knew that, in the end, I wasn\u2019t going to be happy unless you were happy, and besides, I did come prepared this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to continue to make sheep\u2019s eyes at him, I shall leave,\u201d Rolf said. He\u2019d been bitching ever since we\u2019d woken up about ten minutes before, complaining nonstop that I had ruined his life. He had watched with acid comments when I\u2014with Nikola\u2019s advice\u2014managed to disperse the swirly portal until nothing more remained of it but a memory. \u201cIt\u2019s enough to make my stomach sour. Nikola, I shall be raiding your cellar, and expect to hear no chastisement later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are welcome to whatever you can drink,\u201d Nikola said as Rolf staggered off into the woods, still complaining about his ill-treatment.</p> <p>Nikola shook his head, and looked at the carrier bag I\u2019d grabbed before throwing myself through the portal. \u201cDid you bring your presents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. A laptop for us to play on.\u201d I pulled out a small black laptop. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to rig up some way to recharge the battery, but I figure that\u2019ll be a good project to keep you busy for a while. And the same goes for powering my hair dryer.\u201d</p><p>He looked at the pink dryer I laid on top of the laptop. \u201cYou will need to explain electricity in more detail, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best. I got an encyclopedia on DVD for the laptop, so that should help with the parts I don\u2019t know. And then there\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cToilet paper,\u201d he said, nodding at the large package I set to the side. \u201cI understand it is important to you, but, Io, I did not mean for you to sacrifice your happiness for mine. I was content to stay in your time and learn all that there was to learn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilly man,\u201d I told him, leaning over to kiss him. \u201cContent isn\u2019t good enough. I want you ecstatically happy.\u201d</p> <p>He fell backward, pulling me down on top of him, his hands busily sliding up my skirt so that he could stroke my thighs. \u201cI am always ecstatic where you are concerned. As Rolf has gone, and the portal is no more, I will allow you to seduce me here in the Zauberwald, but then we will discuss your heedless actions, and how you must learn that I am master in my home, and your place therein.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOooh, getting all bossy with me, are you?\u201d I murmured, kissing a line down his chest as I unbuttoned his shirt, my fingers and mouth going wild on all the exposed flesh.</p><p>\u201cYes. I am a dominant man, Iolanthe. You may not have noticed this about me\u2014arms up, please; thank you\u2014but I am, and I expect that since you made your choice to live with me at my home, a choice that I would have preferred we discuss before you made such a large sacrifice, but as you have made that choice, then I expect you will abide by my rules.\u201d</p><p>Too many words, I said, wriggling as he peeled off my shirt and bra, his fingers gently stroking my bare breasts. I paused for a moment, looking down at him, noting the deep sapphire blue of his eyes. \u201cI made a sacrifice. Did you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, pulling me down so my breast was at his mouth. I have my soul back. And for that, my love, as for everything else about you, I will be eternally grateful.</p><p>I do so love it when you get mushy on me, I said, squirming with happiness as he laved his tongue along a very sensitive nipple.</p><p>\u201cThen I shall mush for you any time you like. Would you remove my breeches, please? But be careful, they are the only ones I have, and I wish to preserve the silken undergarment that keeps my testicles safe from the toothed apparatus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called a zipper, and I have good news.\u201d I pulled off his shoes and socks, and helped him out of his jeans and underwear before grabbing the carrier bag. \u201cWhen you were with Ben and Finnvid trying to calm Rolf down, I picked up a few more undies for you. See? All sorts of colors.\u201d</p> <p>He looked at the rainbow of silk material I splayed across his belly, his penis happily waving at me as he touched first one, then another of the underwear. \u201cPresents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my darling, presents. For you. I bet if we\u2019re careful, we can make them last a very long time. And then when they wear out, we\u2019ll make a pattern from one, and have some more made up for\u2014Nikola!\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t give me any warning, just pulled me over his body, and impaled me, the silk underwear beneath my thighs as his fingers dug into my hips, urging me on.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for me to give in to the pleasure that I knew I\u2019d always find with him.
